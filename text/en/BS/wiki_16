<text>Michelangelo, nicknamed Mikey, is a superhero and one of the four main characters of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics and all related media. Characterized as the most naturally gifted of the four brothers, Michelangelo prefers leisure to training martial arts. The most jocular and energetic of the team, he is shown to be rather immature; he is known for his wisecracks, quick-wit, optimism, and love of skateboarding and pizza. He is usually depicted wearing an orange eye mask. His signature weapons are a single or dual nunchaku, though he has also been portrayed using other weapons, such as a grappling hook, manriki-gusari, kusarigama, tonfa, and a three-section staff (in some action figures). He is commonly portrayed in media as speaking with a California accent and is most associated with the &quot;Cowabunga&quot; expression that became a pop culture phenomenon.

Michelangelo was given a much bigger role in the 1987 cartoon series and subsequent series and films, directed at a younger audience, than in the more serious Mirage comic books, which were aimed at an older audience. He often coins most of their catchphrases, such as &quot;Cowabunga!&quot; and &quot;Booyakasha!&quot; in the 2012 series.

Like all of the brothers, he is named after an Italian Renaissance artist; in this case, he is named after Michelangelo. His name was originally spelled &quot;Michaelangelo&quot; by the original creators, possibly spelling his namesake&#x27;s name wrong by confusion with &quot;Michael&quot;. In the Mirage comics, all four of the Turtles wear red masks, but to tell them apart, he was given an orange mask in subsequent media.

==Comic books==
===Mirage Comics===
In the Mirage comic books, Michelangelo was initially depicted as fun-loving, carefree, happy-go-lucky, and, while not as aggressive as Raphael, always ready to fight. He is much more serious-natured in the comic book than in the film incarnations, which have labeled his character a permanent &quot;dude&quot; talking teenager. It was Michelangelo&#x27;s one-shot in this series that fleshed out most of the traits that have become synonymous with the character, such as his playfulness, empathy, and easygoing nature. In the one-shot story, Michelangelo adopts a stray cat (which he names Klunk) and also stops thieves from stealing toys meant for orphaned children.

After their defeat at the hands of the Foot Clan, the Turtles, Splinter, April O&#x27;Neil, and Casey Jones retreat to a farmhouse in Northampton, Massachusetts which used to belong to Casey&#x27;s grandmother. While there, April is worried to note that Michelangelo is not himself. He spends his days in the barn taking out his aggression on a punching bag. A scene shows him lashing out at his surroundings and repeatedly punching the wall of the barn until it breaks, then collapsing on it despondently, anger spent. The end of the story implies that Michelangelo&#x27;s sorrow and frustration have been resolved, as subsequent issues restore Michelangelo&#x27;s more relaxed, optimistic personality.

It is during the group&#x27;s time at the farm we learn that Michelangelo also has an interest in comic books, specifically ones involving superheroes such as &quot;The Justice Force&quot; (comic book heroes based on The Justice League and The Fantastic Four). He also finds solace in writing fiction and has produced a story depicting himself as a rōnin in Feudal Japan (vol. 1 Issue #17).

In the story arc &quot;City at War&quot;, Michelangelo instantly bonds with Casey Jones&#x27; adopted daughter Shadow, who nicknames him &quot;Rooish&quot;. In the second volume, the Turtles decide to try to live apart from one another. Michelangelo, the social creature that he is, moves in with April and Casey so that he can be close to Shadow. Throughout the first two volumes, Michelangelo seemed to act as the peacemaker of the team. These stories also laid the foundations which demonstrated his closeness with his brother Donatello, their laid-back natures separating them from the more contentious Leonardo and Raphael.

In Volume 4, Michelangelo gets a job as a tour guide showing alien visitors around Earth. His first (and only) tourist is the &quot;Regenta&quot; (or &quot;princess&quot;) Seri of the Styracodon race. Michelangelo convinces Seri to sneak away from her bodyguards so that he can take her on a tour of the northwest coast of the US. Their relationship becomes more intimate, and Seri delivers eggs that will soon hatch into children. Unfortunately, before much time is given for him to settle with this news Seri&#x27;s bodyguards become aware of his machinations. They attack Michelangelo and transport him back to their homeworld, where he is placed in prison, kept away from Seri and their unborn children. With the help of a Triceraton prisoner named Azokk, he manages to escape and is rescued by a group of Triceratons who came to rescue Azokk. The ordeal results in Mikey&#x27;s personality taking a very dark turn, having been hardened by the cruelty of the extrajudicial prison and Azokk&#x27;s death. Upon the Triceratons learning of Azokk&#x27;s death, they declare war on the Styracodons and carry out a genocidal assault against them. Michelangelo, embittered by Seri&#x27;s apparent betrayal, joins forces with the Triceratons and gladly aids them in acts of genocide against the Styracodons.

Michelangelo was not given an especially large role in Volumes 1 and 2, did little to advance the plot and was often not portrayed as an especially skilled fighter. His relatively small role was probably due to the need to establish Leonardo&#x27;s role as &quot;leader&quot; along with the fact that Donatello was Peter Laird&#x27;s favorite Turtle, and Raphael was Kevin Eastman&#x27;s favorite.

This incarnation of Michelangelo appeared in the &quot;Turtles Forever&quot; crossover special voiced by Bradford Cameron.

===Image Comics===
In the comics published by Image Comics, retroactively setting the Mirage Comics series in the Image Universe, Michelangelo&#x27;s interest in writing is expanded upon and he is established as a writer of fiction and poetry. During this series, Michelangelo develops a romantic relationship with Horridus, whom he credits as his muse in writing. But the relationship would not last, (as the story may have begun after Rapture&#x27;s death), she started staying with Officer Dragon and had developed an attraction to him; though Dragon did not know it himself. Michelangelo would be heartbroken when Sara dumps him. An early issue has him selling his first poem to a poetry digest. As the comic continued, Michelangelo&#x27;s career as a writer gradually expanded. In the final issue, he has published his first novel, a romance called &quot;A Rose Among the Thorns&quot;. April mentions that the book was already going back for a second printing and that she had heard that Oprah Winfrey loved it, which &quot;practically guarantees that it will be a best-seller.&quot; Michelangelo is the only Turtle who did not end up disfigured in some way in this series; Leonardo lost his left hand and had it replaced by a steel cap with a retractable blade, Raphael was facially disfigured after being shot in the face, and Donatello was transformed into a cyborg after being shot and thrown out of a helicopter. Mikey asked Sara for her hand in marriage but was denied. Michelangelo was last seen arriving at the Northampton farmhouse with his family in the final issue.

===Archie Comics===
In the Archie Comics series, Michelangelo was initially presented very similarly to his 1987 cartoon portrayal — understandably, considering that the comic started as an adaptation of the popular animated series. As the series progressed, &quot;Archie&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Michaelangelo&quot; was presented as more mature than the cartoon version. This version developed also an interest in poetry. During a battle, he was temporarily blinded and later captured by the US military, whereupon he was interrogated and tortured. He was eventually rescued by his family and saved the life of the man who tortured him.

One of his many skills in the Archie comics was the ability to communicate with animals. In a storyline set in the future, Michelangelo is shown to have become an artist whose main job is running an orphanage.

===IDW Comics===

Michelangelo like his brothers was reincarnated into a turtle after he was slain by Oroku Saki. He is also the youngest turtle as shown in his human form when he was the only baby among his brothers. He is more mature in this incarnation than others, but is still sociable, for example, bonding with the Mighty Mutanimals and with pizza boy Woody Dirkins. Unfortunately, Michelangelo&#x27;s friendship with Woody waned, as shown in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; Issue 15, when Slash frightened Woody and he left a note for Michelangelo stating that he could not handle the troubles that followed them. However, their rift only lasted briefly before once more reuniting in issue 26. Michelangelo is good friends with all Mutanimals but can be unsure about Old Hob, remembering how Hob had been their enemy. Further, Michelangelo was occasionally anxious about them, showing some concern in Issue 68, in which Hob told the Turtles that Slash had been mind-controlled, taken out all the Mutanimals, and helped capture them for the Earth Protection Force, as well as in Issue 70, in which Michelangelo wondered whether Slash would be okay. Michelangelo is also the most sensitive turtle: &quot;e.g.&quot;, in Issue 50 he couldn&#x27;t handle Splinter accepting the leadership of the Foot Clan. In this incarnation, Michelangelo is romantically interested in Neutrino: Princess Trib instead of Kala based on the 1987 TV series. Michelangelo&#x27;s kindness found him supporting Donatello&#x27;s ideas for just about everything, as when Raphael introduced Donatello&#x27;s tracking device (embedded in a shuriken) in the &quot;Secret History of the Foot Clan&quot;. The after-effects of the war left Michelangelo distraught seeing that he was strict with Raphael when they were mourning Donnie&#x27;s injuries. He also shows signs of intelligence when he decodes ancient Japanese text in the &quot;Ashi no Himitsu&quot; book that tells the secrets of the Foot Clan. Furthermore, he was not afraid to confront Splinter when he had taken the orphans with him to prevent them from training as Foot Ninja. Eventually, he convinced Splinter to listen to him and won their debate. Nonetheless, Michelangelo is still as fun-loving a turtle as in other bodacious versions of himself.

Michelangelo is also the titular character of the miniseries &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin&quot;. Set in a dark future where New York has been conquered by the Shredder&#x27;s grandson Hiroto and the Foot Clan, Michelangelo is the last of the turtles alive; Raphael drowned trying to kill Karai after her attack nearly killed Splinter (Karai was left in a permanent coma by the same attack), Leonardo and Casey Jones were blown up by Baxter Stockman&#x27;s Mousers helping their allies escape, and Donatello and Splinter were betrayed and assassinated during attempted peace talks. Michelangelo returns to New York after years of training with his brothers&#x27; weapons, but his initial assault on Hiroto&#x27;s fortress fails and he nearly commits &quot;seppuku&quot; from shame, only surviving because he passed out due to blood loss before he could finish the job. He was rescued by the still-alive April O&#x27;Neil and her daughter Casey, joining forces with their resistance movement and becoming a sensei figure to Casey, who has a degree of physical enhancement as she inherited mutagen from her parents&#x27; constant exposure to the Turtles before her birth. Mikey ultimately kills Hiroto in a final duel at the cost of his own life. He leaves his journal with April and Casey, who are shown making plans to mutate a new quartet of turtles to continue the legacy of their fallen friends. The sequel series &quot;The Last Ronin: The Lost Years&quot; alternates between April and Casey training the new Turtles and flashbacks looking at Michaelangelo&#x27;s global travels between him learning of Splinter and Donatello&#x27;s deaths and his return to New York. These journeys include a time when he was blinded by radiation poisoning and a time he was captured by a mutant fighting ring, his last friend sacrificing himself so that Michaelangelo could kill the criminal leader responsible for the fight ring and other crimes he had encountered in his travels.

==Television==
===1987 animated series===
Michelangelo&#x27;s persona became strongly established in the 1987 animated series. He was often seen as a &quot;Party Dude&quot;, which, though accurate in the 1987 series (which gave him this title in the theme song), accounts for only part of his personality otherwise. As the &quot;party dude&quot;, he usually did not have much input in the team&#x27;s plans, although he was still just as active as his brothers. He typically spent much of his time joking and socializing with other characters.

Michelangelo began the series with his trademark nunchaku as his weapons, but the controversy surrounding the weapons in the United Kingdom led to scenes of their use being edited out of the local broadcast of the series. To compensate for this, the American showrunners dropped the nunchaku from the series entirely in the fourth season, replacing them with a grappling hook called the &quot;Turtle Line&quot; that served as Mikey&#x27;s signature weapon for the rest of the show&#x27;s run.

Michelangelo also received his distinctive voice in the 1990 series; this has been imitated in other portrayals of him. Employing a &quot;surfer slang&quot; vocabulary, he customarily spoke with a unique hybrid of a Californian surfer accent and a possibly stereotypical &quot;stoner&quot; accent, though no reference is ever made to drugs in the series and it is likely that the voicing simply emphasized his laid-back and somewhat innocent attitude. In fact, Michelangelo appeared in a 1990 animated special, &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;, alongside other famous cartoon characters, intended to inform children about the dangers of substance abuse. Additionally, all four of the Turtles were official &quot;spokes-turtles&quot; of the &quot;Just Say No&quot; anti-drug campaign, despite accusations that at least one of them exhibited characteristics of a stoner. During one of these anti-drug PSAs, Michelangelo suggests to a kid being tempted with marijuana that he should &quot;get a pizza&quot; to go with it before the idea is shot down by Donatello.

Michelangelo&#x27;s voice actor was Townsend Coleman in the 1987 series&#x27; and Johnny Castro in the 25th-anniversary movie &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;. Michelangelo also made a couple of appearances in the 2012 series in the episode, The Manhattan Project. He and the other turtles along with Casey and April are seen through a portal by their 2012 counterparts walking on a road and he made a speaking cameo along with the other turtles at the end of the episode when a space worm from the 2012 dimension started terrorizing the street. All four turtles see the worm and spring into action while shouting their famous catchphrase, &#x27;Cowabunga&#x27;. Townsend Coleman reprised his role as Michelangelo for the cameo. This would mark the first time in over 28 years the 1987 TMNT cast would return to their roles, with the sole exception of Rob Paulsen who returned to the TMNT franchise as Donatello in the 2012 series. The 1987 turtles also had a crossover with the 2012 turtles in the season 4 episode, &quot;Trans-Dimensional Turtles&quot; then in the three-part series final &quot;Wanted: Bebop &amp; Rocksteady&quot;.

===Coming Out of Their Shells tour===
The live-action &quot;Coming Out of Their Shells&quot; concert tour, whose initial show at Radio City Music Hall would be released on Pay per view and later VHS, would see Michelangelo take the role of the band&#x27;s lead singer and guitarist. The character retained his fun-loving attitude and was the most vocal member of the band in the non-musical spoken segments. During the &quot;Cowabunga&quot; song portion of the show, Michelangelo claims that he sees Raphael as his very best friend and that Raphael wrote the music for all the Turtles&#x27; songs, while Michelangelo wrote the lyrics. This is somewhat in keeping with the Mirage and Image comics&#x27; depictions of Michelangelo as a writer and poet. During the event, Michelangelo sings an exclusive ballad not included in the cassette or CD releases for the show called &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; near the show&#x27;s climax when the Turtles begin to feel as though their efforts to defeat Shredder&#x27;s plans to steal all the music in the world are doomed to failure. The song manages to bring the Turtles around, and the team immediately begins making plans to defeat Shredder&#x27;s machine and army, which ultimately succeeds. The &quot;Making of&quot; VHS tape, which acts as an &#x27;in-universe&#x27; supplement to the Radio City Music Hall show and treats the Turtles as real people rather than fictional characters, follows up on the idea that Michelangelo and Raphael had been the driving force behind the band and also indicated that they had stumbled onto the idea by pure accident. The two turtles in question state in the video that they had simply been playing around with some sewer pipes and singing while waiting for a pizza to be delivered. Realizing they had been creating music and finding they enjoyed the experience, they continued to pursue music as a hobby and eventually brought Leonardo and Donatello in on it, leading to them becoming the band depicted in the concerts.

===1997 live-action series===
In the live-action series, &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, Michelangelo was played by Jarred Blancard, and voiced by Kirby Morrow. In the crossover episode with &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;, &quot;Shell Shocked&quot;, Michelangelo is voiced by Tony Oliver instead.

===2003 animated series===
In the 2003 TV series, Michelangelo is voiced by Wayne Grayson and speaks with a California accent. Known as &#x27;Mikey&#x27; to his brothers, his personality is more akin to the Mirage comics than the 1987 show. Still the comic relief, he often makes statements that spoof pop culture, although he uses less surfer slang than in the 1987 cartoon. His trademark nunchaku is once again his primary weapon, but he has used other weapons such as grappling hooks and those of his brothers. He is slightly more immature than in the Mirage comics-particularly apparent by a high-pitched scream, however, he undergoes character development and becomes more mature as the series progresses. Unlike other incarnations, he was often more reluctant to fight and he often likes to tease and annoy his older brothers, especially Raphael, for whom Michelangelo is the foil. In fact, a running gag is that whenever Michelangelo says or does something stupid, usually involving a catch-phrase from the 1987 show, one of his brothers (usually Raphael) will slap him on the head. Other characters such as Master Splinter and the Ancient One have picked up on this habit but usually whenever he disobeys. In the Fast Forward episode &quot;Timing is Everything&quot; when Michelangelo was talking too much, Splinter flipped over the seat he was sitting on causing him to fall on the ground, replying afterwards that &quot;Somebody had to do it. It was... &quot;time&quot;.&quot;

Raphael and Michelangelo mostly have a love-hate relationship in which Michelangelo frequently antagonizes Raphael (it especially hurts Raphael&#x27;s pride that Michelangelo has bested him more than once, both times because Raphael&#x27;s anger got in the way), but Raphael shows that he cares about him whenever he is in danger. He also seems to be very close with Donatello, where the two are often paired together when Leonardo and Raphael are either arguing or training. Also, Mikey is often the one most enthusiastic about Donatello&#x27;s newest finished invention and would jump straight into &quot;helping&quot; Don with his first test run on it, though his &quot;help&quot; is not greatly appreciated by the latter and often generates more trouble. Donatello has also invented a hovercraft- a flying skateboard, at one point of time in Season 2 as means of keeping him quiet while Donatello himself worked. His closest bond is with his oldest brother Leonardo whom he looks up to and idolizes greatly. Even though his older brothers are irritated with him, he is still a lovable brother and like a baby brother to them. When Mikey was a kid, he and his brothers went with Master Splinter to Japan to bury Master Yoshi&#x27;s ashes next to his beloved. While there they helped Master Splinter and the Ancient One win a fight against a ghost that was sent by the Foot Mystics to revive the Demon Shredder and that is when they gain their ninja masks. This happens in the episode (Fathers and Sons).

Michelangelo is the youngest brother, also appointed to be &quot;the one with the brightest fire&quot; or with the most potential by The Ancient One. Master Splinter also claims a few times that Michelangelo obtains the most &quot;raw talent&quot; of all the brothers. Although, both Master Splinter and The Ancient One, say because of Michelangelo&#x27;s lack of focus and interest in training, he will probably never meet his full potential. Michelangelo also claims many times in this series that he wishes not to be so serious and focused as his eldest brother, Leonardo. He also tells his other brothers to &quot;chillax&quot; and not be so serious all the time.

His agility and speed also play a bigger role than in the comics or other TV series and movies. It is shown in activities such as training runs, fights, and training that Michelangelo clearly is the fastest of the four, in which his brothers are constantly having to catch up with him. It also plays a role in the 1st season when Michelangelo and Raphael are fighting, that Michelangelo keeps taunting Raphael, but because of his speed, Raphael cannot tackle him. This is shown more than once. His speed was the main reason he won The Battle Nexus, along with his ability to &quot;get under people&#x27;s skin&quot; and taunt them. He is also portrayed as the best gymnast of the four. This is true partly because Master Splinter always sends him off to do backflips or extra training as punishment for goofing off or losing focus. Both of these abilities allow Michelangelo to taunt his opponents and beat them quickly without getting hurt by his opponent in the process.

He has shown innocent empathy for others as shown in particular by his adoption of Klunk the stray kitten, to whom he is very close and also by his relationship with Leatherhead. It is his initial awareness of Leatherhead&#x27;s humanity which ends up forging the bond between the crocodile and the other Turtles. He enjoys Leatherhead&#x27;s company, although he can tease him on occasion against his better judgment. However, he cares greatly for the crocodile and is quick and willing to forgive and reassure him when a rampaging Leatherhead injures him in a blind, nightmarish rage in the episode &#x27;Hunted.&#x27; Leatherhead also appears to care greatly for Michelangelo and is distraught when he believes he has fatally injured him, but delighted to discover that his fears are unfounded when he finds out that the turtle is alive and well.

As in the Mirage comics, Michelangelo is an avid fan of comic book superheroes. In some episodes, he takes on the role of a costumed superhero called &quot;Turtle Titan&quot; and befriends other superheroes such as the &quot;Silver Sentry&quot; and the &quot;Justice Force&quot;. As Turtle Titan, Michelangelo uses grappling hooks as both a weapon and a mode of transportation.

Although not shown as particularly focused on ninjutsu, preferring to spend his time reading comics or watching movies, he is quite an effective fighter. In the Season 2 finale, he became the Battle Nexus Champion, considered the best fighter in the multiverse, but his initial victory was due in part to several very lucky breaks (with Raphael even referring to it as &quot;sheer dumb luck, emphasis on the &#x27;dumb&#x27; part), including Splinter withdrawing to allow his sons to progress and Leonardo being eliminated by poisoning (although Mikey did defeat Raphael and Donatello was knocked out earlier). Michelangelo later won a rematch against the last finalist and earned a medal of honor for his behavior during the battle, with his ninjutsu prowess being spurred when the opponent revealed that he intended to kill Raphael, Leonardo and Donatello as well after killing Michelangelo in battle, prompting the latter to recall Leonardo&#x27;s words on how if one of them went down, then all of them would go down as well.

In the crossover movie &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, Mikey is the only Turtle who initially likes their comedic 1987 counterparts (he is especially fascinated by the initials on their belt buckles). However, he eventually gets tired of their laid-back attitudes and yells at them when they don&#x27;t take the 2003 incarnation of Shredder seriously, proving even this version of Mikey has his limits to fooling around.

In early profiles of the 2003 animated series, Michelangelo is regarded as being both the most athletic of the four, and as possessing the single greatest potential in the martial arts out of the quartet, although unfocused on training mentally (though those are admittedly old profiles and may have been early plans for the character, he has certainly proven he is an effective fighter when need be) which prevents him from reaching his fullest potential. This profile statement has since been repeated in the profile of Michelangelo in the lead-up to the debut of the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; season which began airing on July 29, 2006.

===2012 animated series===

In the new 2012 series, Michelangelo uses both a kusarigama and nunchaku. His character design was updated as well, making him slightly shorter than his brothers and giving him dark freckles as well as shorter tails on his mask. Mikey is voiced by Greg Cipes.

Mikey is the youngest brother and is prone to goofing off rather than focusing on his training. However, he is still an impressive fighter. His natural affinity for the martial arts is present in his ability to learn moves after seeing them only a few times. He also has the ability to fight without &quot;thinking&quot;, once deflecting Splinter&#x27;s blows while listening to music with his eyes closed, which was something that Donatello had to learn (Although he was unable to do this when directly asked to fight without thinking in their first fight with the telepathic Victor Falco). Also, Mikey has a rare ability to see something off in people and mutants, shown when a Kraang robot of April&#x27;s mother, dub Mom thing, and with two of the Might Mutant Animals, Slash and Dr. Rockwell, after they escape capture from the Shredder.

Mikey seems to respect Leonardo and although there are few scenes with them interacting together in the first two seasons, it&#x27;s clear that Leonardo cares about his youngest brother. In season three, however, the two of them go on missions together. While looking for Karai one evening, they worked together to rescue their brothers, April, and Casey from Bebop and Rocksteady. After Karai is captured by Shredder, Leo volunteers to go solo to find a way to help her, Mikey tags alongside him and assures him he is there for him. When Mikey gets eaten by the MegaShredder, Leo fights with all of his might to save him. After Mikey escapes from inside the monster, Leo is overjoyed to see him alive and is proud of the work they have done. Raphael is normally seen as the one Mikey loves to hang out with, usually to Raph&#x27;s ire. Although Raph repeatedly gives Mikey a beat down for his antics (usually in the form of slapping him to make him shut up) he occasionally shows a more sensitive side when Mikey is feeling down. Particularly at the end of season 2 and the first half of season 3, Raphael is much kinder to Michelangelo and often refers to him affectionately as &quot;little brother&quot;. He is also less inclined to slap Mikey, instead flicking him with a finger as a sort of &quot;warning&quot;. Of all his brothers, Mikey seems to be the closest to Donatello. This probably stems from the fact that although they are very different they both share a curiosity about things outside ninjutsu. Mikey greatly admires Donnie&#x27;s new gadgets and is normally the first to test them out. Mikey additionally enjoys creating names for all the mutated forms of villains in the series, naming ones like &quot;Dogpound&quot; and &quot;Fishface&quot;. He even is upset with Donnie when he decides on a name (Newtralizer) before Mikey gets the chance, and Donatello yells at Mikey when he attempts to name the mutated Kirby O&#x27;Neil &quot;Wingnut&quot; - &quot;You are NOT giving Mr. O&#x27;Neil a monster name!&quot;

Although Mikey is not the fastest of mind and has a tendency to make mistakes, it is very clear that all of his brothers care very deeply for him. They all show great distress when he gets hurt or is in trouble, and anger at the one who threatens him, i.e. when Baxter Stockman is throwing Mikey around he is in his more advanced armor. More often than not, Raphael is the one to shout Mikey&#x27;s name first and attack whoever has harmed his little brother, and was distraught when Mikey was injured during his (Raphael&#x27;s) brief period as leader of the team.

Master Splinter has yet to reveal what it is Michelangelo must improve on, other than a need to focus. In the First Nickelodeon TMNT Comic Master Splinter states that Mikey has more raw talent than his three brothers combined. Later in an episode, he says that Mikey has his &quot;challenges&quot; too. And even if Mikey can give his brothers grief, they will always care and love him and have his back. It is heavily implied that this version of Mikey has some form of ADHD. And, it was even stated in his original bio, confirming it.

Unlike past incarnations, Mikey does not say his famous &quot;Cowabunga&quot; catchphrase, but instead says &quot;BOOYAKASHA!&quot; He usually does this when accomplishing something or attacking an enemy. In the episode &quot;Meet Mondo Gecko&quot; the character Jason (AKA Mondo Gecko) uses &#x27;cowabunga&#x27; as his own catchphrase, and Michelangelo says it is &quot;too old school&quot; but later asks if he can use it from time to time. In the episode &quot;Journey to the Center of Mikey&#x27;s Mind&quot;, he says &quot;Booyakabunga&quot; (a mixture of both Booyakasha and Cowabunga).

Michelangelo also has an affinity for animals in this incarnation, as well as a fear of squirrels. Whilst he is more interested in comics and cartoon shows (such as Crognard the Barbarian, which is a parody of &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;; and Super Robo Mecha Force Five, which is a parody of both &quot;Voltron&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!&quot;, the latter of which also created by the series creator Ciro Nieli) than animals, he adopted a cat April found on the street after the cat ate some mutagen Mikey had spilled ice cream in, resulting in the arable and delicious Ice Cream Kitty; most likely this incarnation&#x27;s version of Klunk. Michelangelo&#x27;s relationship with Ice Cream Kitty parallels Raphael&#x27;s with pre-mutation Spike, wherein he will tell Ice Cream Kitty his innermost feelings and fears, and not feel judged by them - as often his brothers find Mikey&#x27;s concerns and thoughts too silly to be worth their time, though said concerns end up being true quite often; such as the existence of the Kraang in &quot;Rise of the Turtles Pt1&quot;. Bearing this in mind, however, Michelangelo does not seem to have any special relationships with animals like he has done in other incarnations, though he still cares for animals deeply, as exhibited by his caring for April&#x27;s chickens whilst the Turtles are at April&#x27;s old farmhouse at the start of season 3. In season 4, when traveling with his brothers, April, Casey, and a robot called the Fugitoid, Mikey&#x27;s mind is invaded by microscopic aliens, but his brothers soon chase the robots in a strange world in Mikey&#x27;s subconscious and soon defeat them, putting Mikey&#x27;s mind back to normal.

===2018 animated series===

In the 2018 animated series, &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Brandon Mychal Smith voices a Michelangelo described as &quot;the youngest brother, an artist and awesome skateboarder with a wild colorful, and imaginative personality.&quot; This incarnation of Michelangelo lacks a surfer accent and likes to refer to himself as the artist of the group. He possesses a more childlike naiveness. He also has a strong passion for cooking too.

Michelangelo uses a mystic Kusari Fundo, the fiery end of which features a spooky face. He is seen to be able to lift and throw massive objects while in a battle against the Shredder like docked ships and vehicles. Mikey often uses this weapon to show his agility by swinging around the city, using it as a grappling hook. Mikey often uses this in a combination attack with his ninja brothers and is seen swinging them toward an opponent at high speeds so they can deliver a swift blow.

In this series, Michelangelo&#x27;s character design is based on a box turtle, and he is one of the only brothers who is able to retract his legs and limbs into his shell. This can be seen in the first episode &quot;Mystic Mayhem&quot; when Raphael grabs his shell and throws him.

Michelangelo often acts as the peacemaker, and it is really important to him that his family / extended family be on good terms with one another. This can be seen when he invites his brothers, and father Splinter to a meal with the hopes that they will reconcile with Draxum.

In &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie&quot;, Mikey mostly takes a backseat throughout the film looking out for Donnie and trying to unlock mystic powers throughout the film that his future self used to send Casey Jones back in time. The latter ends up paying off as Mikey ends up unlocking the power&#x27;s and used them to rescue Leonardo from the prison dimension.

==Movies==

===Original trilogy (1990–1993)===
Michelangelo is depicted in the live-action movies as the easy-going, free-spirited turtle. One of his movie catchphrases is, &quot;I love being a turtle! &quot; and &quot;Cowabunga!&quot; Owing to his popularity with children, he is given many lines and comes up with several (slightly outrageous) plans to advance plots. He speaks with a distinctive California accent (that was imitated in the later versions of TMNT), In the first movie, he and Donatello (who was instead portrayed as the skateboarder of the team) were regularly paired together while Leonardo and Raphael were arguing. In the first movie and the first sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, he was portrayed by Michelan Sisti; in the second sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;, he was portrayed by David Fraser. In all three movies, he was voiced by &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; alum Robbie Rist.

===2007 film===
In &quot;TMNT&quot;, Mikey has taken to performing at children&#x27;s birthday parties as &quot;Cowabunga Carl&quot; in order to help make ends meet to support his family. It becomes apparent early in the film that the physical and emotional absence of his older brothers has finally begun to affect the outgoing Michelangelo; when he returns home from work and announces his presence and no one acknowledges him, he sighs &quot;Whatever..this place used to be fun&quot;. Unlike his other incarnations, the 2007 Mikey seems to draw the most emotional support from Donatello instead of his oldest brothers, Leonardo and Raphael. Upon Leonardo&#x27;s return from Central America, Mikey gives his oldest brother an enthusiastic hug, falling over the couch and tripping over furniture in his excitement. Mikey&#x27;s lively and innocent demeanor returns in full force when he is in the protective presence of his three brothers again, his good-natured jokes and brief commentaries lightening even in hard situations. Clearly, despite the hardship that his family has recently experienced, Michelangelo has retained much of his usual goofy, laid-back personality and still remains the main form of funny. He is voiced by Mikey Kelley. He is a skilled skateboarder in this movie, able to complete many tricks underground.

===Reboot (2014–2016)===
Michelangelo appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; portrayed by Noel Fisher. In the film, he is the youngest and the jokester of the group who loves watching viral videos, playing video games, and skateboarding. Michelangelo tries to find humor in any situation. However, he proves to be a great fighter if someone messes with him and his brothers. He is not afraid to express his true feelings and also has a crush on April, who does not return her feelings to him. In the end, when the Turtles are leaving in their van after Mikey blows up Vern Fenwick&#x27;s car, Mikey tries to impress April by singing The Turtles&#x27; &quot;Happy Together&quot;. He appears in the sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, with Fisher reprising the role.

===DC crossover film===
Michelangelo appears in the direct-to-video crossover film &quot;Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, voiced by Kyle Mooney.

=== &quot;Mutant Mayhem&quot; ===
Michelangelo appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, the first animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film since &quot;TMNT (2007)&quot;, voiced by real teenager Shamon Brown Jr. Much like his other counterparts, he is a jokester and most interested in wanting to be part of the real world. He becomes close friends with Mondo Gecko due to their mutual personalities and being more loose and carefree.

==Video games==
In the video games based on the 1987 animated series, Michelangelo is virtually identical to Leonardo on every level except attack range. However, to reflect his flashy personality, he was changed and became the most agile Turtle in the video games based on the 2003 animated series while Raphael was the least skilled. In &quot;&quot;, he is voiced by Wayne Grayson.

Michelangelo is one of the main playable characters in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, where he is voiced by Pierce Cravens. Michelangelo also appears in the 2014 film-based game, voiced by Peter Oldring.

Michelangelo is featured as one of the playable characters from &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; as DLC in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, voiced by Ryan Cooper. While Leonardo is the default turtle, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello can be picked through selection similar to other premier skin characters.

Michelangelo is featured as a TMNT season pass in &quot;Smite&quot; as a Mercury skin, voiced by Nick Landis. He is also available as a skin in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;.

Michelangelo is also a main playable character in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In the game, Michelangelo is now the fastest turtle with low range and average power, as opposed to the original, in which he has average speed, average range, and high power. This is the first official &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; game in which he is played by his original voice actor, Townsend Coleman.

Michelangelo also appeared &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot;, with Townsend Coleman reprising his role.

==Spelling==
The character&#x27;s name was originally spelled as &quot;Michaelangelo&quot;, with an additional &quot;a&quot;. This spelling was used until 2001 with Volume 4 of the comic series from Mirage Studios when the spelling was officially changed to &quot;Michelangelo&quot;. The 1996 anime also used the &quot;Michelangelo&quot; spelling. On the &quot;TMNT&quot; 2007 movie teaser poster featuring Michelangelo, the character&#x27;s name is spelled &quot;Michaelangelo&quot;, though the movie uses the proper spelling of the name in its credits.

==Klunk==
Klunk is Michelangelo&#x27;s pet cat. He first appeared in the Michelangelo microseries, and was hit by a car and died in the &quot;Tales of the TMNT&quot; vol. 2 issue 9. Shortly after, the Turtles discovered that Klunk had mated and had kittens with an alley cat.

Klunk also appears in a few episodes of the 2003 cartoon, starting with &quot;The Christmas Aliens.&quot; Based on the revamped character designs in the &quot;Back to the Sewer&quot; season, this version of Klunk appears to be female, whereas the Klunk from the Mirage comics was confirmed to be male.

<text>The Bay of Puck or Puck Bay (; ; ), is a shallow western branch of the Bay of Gdańsk in the southern Baltic Sea, off the shores of Gdańsk Pomerania, Poland. It is separated from the open sea by the Hel Peninsula.

The bay has an average depth of to . There is a shallow sand-bank from Rewa to Kuźnica in the middle of Hel Peninsula. The bay is available only for small fishing boats and yachts, which have to stick to the strict deeper routes. There are deposits of potassium salt below the Bay of Puck. The main ports are Puck, Jastarnia, and Hel.

The name has nothing to do with the sport of ice hockey. In Polish the word &quot;puck&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything, and the sport is popular only in the southern part of the country, opposite to the coast.

<doc id="538083" wikidata="Q643921" url="?curid=538083" title="Astronomical naming conventions">
<text>In ancient times, only the Sun and Moon, a few stars, and the most easily visible planets had names. Over the last few hundred years, the number of identified astronomical objects has risen from hundreds to over a billion, and more are discovered every year. Astronomers need to be able to assign systematic designations to unambiguously identify all of these objects, and at the same time give names to the most interesting objects, and where relevant, features of those objects.

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the recognized authority in astronomy for assigning designations to celestial bodies such as stars, planets, and minor planets, including any surface features on them. In response to the need for unambiguous names for astronomical objects, it has created a number of systematic naming systems for objects of various sorts.

== Stars ==
There are no more than a few thousand stars that appear sufficiently bright in Earth&#x27;s sky to be visible to the naked eye. This represents the number of stars available to be named by ancient cultures. The upper boundary to what is physiologically possible to be seen with the unaided eye is an apparent magnitude of 6, or about ten thousand stars. With the advent of the increased light-gathering abilities of the telescope, many more stars became visible, far too many to all be given names. The earliest naming system which is still popular is the Bayer designation using the name of constellations to identify the stars within them.

The IAU is the only internationally recognized authority for assigning astronomical designations to celestial objects and surface features on them. The purpose of this is to ensure that names assigned are unambiguous. There have been many historical star catalogues, and new star catalogues are set up on a regular basis as new sky surveys are performed. All designations of objects in recent star catalogues start with an &quot;initialism&quot;, which is kept globally unique by the IAU. Different star catalogues then have different naming conventions for what goes after the initialism, but modern catalogs tend to follow a set of generic rules for the data formats used.

The IAU does not recognize the commercial practice of selling fictitious star names by commercial star-naming companies.

=== Proper names ===
There are about 300 to 350 stars with traditional or historical proper names. They tend to be the brightest stars in the sky and are often the most prominent ones of the constellation. Examples are Betelgeuse, Rigel and Vega. Most such names are derived from the Arabic language &quot;(see List of Arabic star names § History of Arabic star names)&quot;.

Stars may have multiple proper names, as many different cultures named them independently. Polaris, for example, has also been known by the names &quot;Alruccabah&quot;, &quot;Angel Stern, Cynosura&quot;, the &quot;Lodestar&quot;, &quot;Mismar&quot;, &quot;Navigatoria&quot;, &quot;Phoenice&quot;, the &quot;Pole Star&quot;, the &quot;Star of Arcady&quot;, &quot;Tramontana&quot; and &quot;Yilduz&quot; at various times and places by different cultures in human history.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN (on 30 June and 20 July 2016) together with names of stars adopted by the IAU Executive Committee Working Group on Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign and recognized by the WGSN. Further batches of names were approved on 21 August 2016, 12 September 2016 and 5 October 2016. These were listed in a table included in the WGSN&#x27;s second bulletin issued in October 2016. The next additions were done on 1 February, 30 June, 5 September and 19 November 2017, and on 6 June 2018. All are included on the current List of IAU-approved Star Names.

The star nearest to Earth is typically referred to simply as &quot;the Sun&quot; or its equivalent in the language being used (for instance, if two astronomers were speaking French, they would call it &quot;le Soleil&quot;). However, it is usually called by its Latin name, Sol, in science fiction.

==== Named after people ====
There are about two dozen stars such as Barnard&#x27;s Star and Kapteyn&#x27;s Star that have historic names and which were named in honor after astronomers. As a result of the NameExoWorlds campaign in December 2015 the IAU approved the names Cervantes (honoring the writer Miguel de Cervantes) and Copernicus (honoring the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus) for the stars Mu Arae and 55 Cancri A, respectively. In July 2016, the IAU WGSN approved the name &quot;Cor Caroli&quot; (Latin for &#x27;heart of Charles&#x27;) for the star Alpha Canum Venaticorum, so named in honour of King Charles I of England by Sir Charles Scarborough, his physician. In 2019, IAU held the NameExoWorlds campaign.

=== Catalogues ===
With the advent of the increased light-gathering abilities of the telescope, many more stars became visible, far too many to all be given names. Instead, they have designations assigned to them by a variety of different star catalogues. Older catalogues either assigned an arbitrary number to each object, or used a simple systematic naming scheme based on the constellation the star lies in, like the older Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest in Greek from 150 and Al-Sufi&#x27;s Book of Fixed Stars in Arabic from 964. The variety of sky catalogues now in use means that most bright stars currently have multiple designations.

In 1540, the Italian astronomer Piccolomini released the book &quot;De le Stelle Fisse&quot; (On the Fixed Stars) which include star maps of 47 constellations where he numbered the stars in magnitude order using latin letters. 

==== Bayer designation ====
The Bayer designations of about 1,500 brightest stars were first published in 1603. In this list, a star is identified by a lower-case letter of the Greek alphabet, followed by the Latin name of its parent constellation. The Bayer designation uses the possessive form of a constellation&#x27;s name, which in almost every case ends in &quot;is&quot;, &quot;i&quot; or &quot;ae&quot;; &quot;um&quot; if the constellation&#x27;s name is plural &quot;(see genitive case for constellations)&quot;. In addition, a three-letter abbreviation is often used . Examples include Alpha Andromedae (&quot;α And&quot;) in the constellation of Andromeda, Alpha Centauri (&quot;α Cen&quot;), in the constellation Centaurus, Alpha Crucis (&quot;α Cru&quot;) and Beta Crucis (&quot;β Cru&quot;), the two brightest stars in the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross, Epsilon Carinae (&quot;ε Car&quot;) in Carina, Lambda Scorpii (&quot;λ Sco&quot;) in Scorpius and Sigma Sagittarii (&quot;σ Sgr&quot;) in Sagittarius. After all twenty-four Greek letters have been assigned, upper and lower case Latin letters are used, such as for A Centauri (&quot;A Cen&quot;), D Centauri (&quot;D Cen&quot;), G Scorpii (&quot;G Sco&quot;), P Cygni (&quot;P Cyg&quot;), b Sagittarii (&quot;b Sgr&quot;), d Centauri (&quot;d Cen&quot;) and s Carinae (&quot;s Car&quot;).

As the resolving power of telescopes increased, numerous objects that were thought to be a single object were found to be optical star systems that were too closely spaced in the sky to be discriminated by the human eye. This led to a third iteration, where numeric superscripts were added to distinguish those previously unresolved stars. Examples include Theta Sagittarii (&quot;θ Sgr&quot;) later distinguished as Theta¹ Sagittarii (&quot;θ¹ Sgr&quot;) and Theta² Sagittarii (&quot;θ² Sgr&quot;), each being their own (physical) star system with two and three stars, respectively.

==== Flamsteed designation ====
Flamsteed designations consist of a number and the Latin genitive of the constellation the star lies in. Examples include 51 Pegasi and 61 Cygni. About 2,500 stars are catalogued. They are commonly used when no Bayer designation exists, or when the Bayer designation uses numeric superscripts such as in Rho¹ Cancri. In this case, the simpler Flamsteed designation, 55 Cancri, is often preferred.

==== Modern catalogues ====
Most modern catalogues are generated by computers, using high-resolution, high-sensitivity telescopes, and as a result describe very large numbers of objects. For example, the Guide Star Catalog II has entries on over 998 million distinct astronomical objects. Objects in these catalogs are typically located with very high resolution, and assign designations to these objects based on their position in the sky. An example of such a designation is &quot;SDSSp J153259.96−003944.1&quot;, where the initialism &quot;SDSSp&quot; indicates that the designation is from the &quot;Sloan Digital Sky Survey preliminary objects&quot;, and the other characters indicate celestial coordinates (epoch &#x27;J&#x27;, right ascension 153259.96, declination −00°39′44.1″).

=== Variable stars ===

Variable stars are assigned designations in a variable star scheme that is based on a variation of the Bayer designation format, with an identifying label preceding the Latin genitive of the name of the constellation in which the star lies. Such designations mark them as variable stars. Examples include R Cygni, RR Lyrae, and V1331 Cygni. The International Astronomical Union delegates the task to the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow, Russia.

=== Compact stars ===

==== Pulsars ====
Pulsars such as PSR J0737-3039, are designated with a &quot;PSR&quot; prefix, that stands for &quot;Pulsating Source of Radio&quot;. The prefix is followed by the pulsar&#x27;s right ascension and degrees of declination. The right ascension is also prefixed with a &quot;J&quot; (Julian epoch) or a &quot;B&quot; (Besselian Epochs) used prior to 1993, as in PSR B1257+12.

==== Black holes ====
Black holes have no consistent naming conventions. Supermassive black holes receive the designation of the galaxy whose core they reside in. Examples are NGC 4261, NGC 4151 and M31, which derive their designation from the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot; and the list of &quot;Messier objects&quot;.

Other black holes, such as Cygnus X-1 – a highly likely stellar black hole, are cataloged by their constellation and the order in which they were discovered. A large number of black holes are designated by their position in the sky and prefixed with the instrument or survey that discovered them. Examples are (where SDSS stands for Sloan Digital Sky Survey), and RX J1131−1231, observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

=== Supernovae ===
Supernova discoveries are reported to the IAU&#x27;s &quot;Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams&quot; and are automatically given a provisional designation based on the co-ordinates of the discovery. Historically, when supernovae are identified as belonging to a &quot;type&quot;, CBAT has also published circulars with assigned year–letter designations, and discovery details. A supernova&#x27;s permanent designation is formed by the standard prefix &quot;SN&quot;, the year of discovery, and a suffix composed of one to three letters of the Latin alphabet. The first 26 supernovae of the year receive a capital letter from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;. Subsequent supernovae of that year are designated with pairs of lower-case letters from &quot;aa&quot; to &quot;az&quot;, and then continuing with &quot;ba&quot; until &quot;zz&quot;. Then come &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;aab&quot;, and so on (this first occurred in 2015-2016). For example, the prominent SN 1987A, was the first one to be observed in 1987, while SN 2023ixf was one of the brightest ever observed in recent times. Several thousand supernovae have been reported since 1885. In recent years, several supernova discovery projects have retained their more distant supernova discoveries for in-house follow-up, and not reported them to CBAT. Starting in 2015, CBAT has scaled back its efforts to publish assigned designations of typed supernovae: By September 2014, CBAT had published names and details of 100 supernovae discovered in that year. By September 2015, CBAT had only published names of 20 supernovae discovered in that year. The Astronomer&#x27;s Telegram provides some surrogate services independent from CBAT.

Four historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred: SN 1006 (the brightest stellar event ever recorded), SN 1054 (of which the remnant is the Crab Nebula and the Crab Pulsar), SN 1572 (&quot;Tycho&#x27;s Nova&quot;), and SN 1604 (&quot;Kepler&#x27;s Star&quot;).

Since 1885, the letter-suffixes are explicitly assigned, regardless whether only one supernova is detected during the entire year (although this has not occurred since 1947). Driven by advances in technology and increases in observation time in the early 21st century, hundreds of supernovae were reported every year to the IAU, with more than 500 catalogued in 2007. Since then, the number of newly discovered supernovae has increased to thousands per year, for example almost 16,000 supernovae observations were reported in 2019, more than 2,000 of which were named by CBAT.

== Constellations ==
The sky was divided into constellations by historic astronomers, according to perceived patterns in the sky. At first, only the shapes of the patterns were defined, and the names and numbers of constellations varied from one star map to another. Despite being scientifically meaningless, they do provide useful reference points in the sky for human beings, including astronomers. In 1930, the boundaries of these constellations were fixed by Eugène Joseph Delporte and adopted by the IAU, so that now every point on the celestial sphere belongs to a particular constellation.

== Galaxies ==
Like stars, most galaxies do not have names. There are a few exceptions such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and others, but most simply have a catalog number.

In the 19th century, the exact nature of galaxies was not yet understood, and the early catalogs simply grouped together open clusters, globular clusters, nebulas, and galaxies: the Messier catalog has 110 in total. The Andromeda Galaxy is Messier object 31, or M31; the Whirlpool Galaxy is M51. The New General Catalogue (NGC, J. L. E. Dreyer 1888) was much larger and contained nearly 8,000 objects, still mixing galaxies with nebulas and star clusters.

== Planets ==
The brightest planets in the sky have been named from ancient times. The scientific names are taken from the names given by the Romans: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Our own planet is usually named in English as Earth, or the equivalent in the language being spoken (for instance, two astronomers speaking French would call it &quot;la Terre&quot;). However, it is only recently in human history that it has been thought of as a planet. Earth, when viewed as a planet, is sometimes also called by its Latin scientific conventional name &quot;Terra&quot;, this name is especially prevalent in science fiction where the adjective &quot;terran&quot; is also used in the way which &quot;Lunar&quot; or &quot;Jovian&quot; is for Earth&#x27;s moon or Jupiter. The Latin convention derives from the use of that language as an international scientific language by the first modern astronomers like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and others and was used for a long time. This is why the later discovered bodies were also named accordingly.
Two more bodies that were discovered later, and considered planets when discovered, are still generally considered planets now:
* Uranus, discovered by William Herschel in 1781
* Neptune, discovered by Johann Gottfried Galle in 1846 (based on prediction by Urbain Le Verrier)

These were given names from Greek or Roman myth, to match the ancient planet names—but only after some controversy. For example, Sir William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, and originally called it &quot;Georgium Sidus&quot; (George&#x27;s Star) in honour of King George III of the United Kingdom. French astronomers began calling it Herschel before German Johann Bode proposed the name Uranus, after the Greek god. The name &quot;Uranus&quot; did not come into common usage until around 1850.

Starting in 1801, asteroids were discovered between Mars and Jupiter. The first few (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta) were initially considered planets. As more and more were discovered, they were soon stripped of their planetary status. On the other hand, Pluto was considered to be a planet at the time of its discovery in 1930, as it was found beyond Neptune. Following this pattern, several hypothetical bodies were given names: Vulcan for a planet within the orbit of Mercury; Phaeton for a planet between Mars and Jupiter that was believed to be the precursor of the asteroids; Themis for a moon of Saturn; and Persephone, and several other names, for a trans-Plutonian planet.

Derived from Classical mythology, these names are only considered standard in Western discussion of the planets. Astronomers in societies that have other traditional names for the planets may use those names in scientific discourse. For instance, IAU does not disapprove of astronomers discussing Jupiter in Arabic using the traditional Arabic name for the planet, &quot;Al-Mushtarīy&quot;.

Some sixty years after the discovery of Pluto, a large number of large trans-Neptunian objects began to be discovered. Under the criteria of classifying these Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), it became dubious whether Pluto would have been considered a planet had it been discovered in the 1990s. Its mass is now known to be much smaller than once thought and, with the discovery of Eris, it is simply one of the two largest known trans-Neptunian objects. In 2006, Pluto was therefore reclassified into a different class of astronomical bodies known as dwarf planets, along with Eris and others.

=== Exoplanets ===
Currently, according to the IAU, there is no agreed upon system for designating exoplanets (planets orbiting other stars). The process of naming them is organized by the IAU Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites. The scientific nomenclature for the designations usually consists of a proper noun or abbreviation that often corresponds to the star&#x27;s name, followed by a lowercase letter (starting with &#x27;b&#x27;), like 51 Pegasi b.

The lowercase lettering style is drawn from the IAU&#x27;s long-established rules for naming binary and multiple star systems. A primary star, which is brighter and typically bigger than its companion stars, is designated by a capitalized A. Its companions are labelled B, C, and so on. For example, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is actually a double star, consisting of the naked-eye visible Sirius A and its dim white-dwarf companion Sirius B. The first exoplanet tentatively identified around the second brightest star in the triple star system Alpha Centauri is accordingly called Alpha Centauri Bb. If an exoplanet orbits both of the stars in a binary system, its name can be, for example, Kepler-34(AB) b.

=== Natural satellites ===
Earth&#x27;s natural satellite is simply known as the Moon, or the equivalent in the language being spoken (for instance, two astronomers speaking French would call it &quot;la Lune&quot;). English-language science fiction often adopts the Latin name &quot;Luna&quot; while using the English &quot;Moon&quot; as a term for natural satellites in general in order to better distinguish the wider concept from any specific example. Natural satellites of other planets are generally named after mythological figures related to their parent body&#x27;s namesake, such as Phobos and Deimos, the twin sons of Ares (Mars), or the Galilean moons of Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, four consorts of Zeus (Jupiter). Satellites of Uranus are instead named after characters from works by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope, such as Umbriel or Titania.

When natural satellites are first discovered, they are given provisional designations such as &quot;S/2010 J 2&quot; (the 2nd new satellite of Jupiter discovered in 2010) or &quot;S/2003 S 1&quot; (the 1st new satellite of Saturn discovered in 2003). The initial &quot;S/&quot; stands for &quot;satellite&quot;, and distinguishes from such prefixes as &quot;D/&quot;, &quot;C/&quot;, and &quot;P/&quot;, used for comets. The designation &quot;R/&quot; is used for planetary rings. These designations are sometimes written like &quot;S/2003 S1&quot;, dropping the second space. The letter following the category and year identifies the planet (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; although no occurrence of the other planets is expected, Mars and Mercury are disambiguated through the use of Hermes for the latter). Pluto was designated by P prior to its recategorization as a dwarf planet. When the object is found around a minor planet, the identifier used is the latter&#x27;s number in parentheses. Thus, Dactyl, the moon of 243 Ida, was at first designated &quot;S/1993 (243) 1&quot;. Once confirmed and named, it became (243) Ida I Dactyl. Similarly, the fourth satellite of Pluto, Kerberos, discovered after Pluto was categorized as a dwarf planet and assigned a minor planet number, was designated S/2011 (134340) 1 rather than S/2011 P 1, though the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team, who disagreed with the dwarf planet classification, used the latter.
* H = Mercury (Hermes)
* V = Venus
* E = Earth
* M = Mars
* J = Jupiter
* S = Saturn
* U = Uranus
* N = Neptune

After a few months or years, when a newly discovered satellite&#x27;s existence has been confirmed and its orbit computed, a permanent name is chosen, which replaces the &quot;S/&quot; provisional designation. However, in the past, some satellites remained unnamed for surprisingly long periods after their discovery. See Naming of moons for a history of how some of the major satellites got their current names.

The Roman numbering system arose with the very first discovery of natural satellites other than Earth&#x27;s: Galileo referred to the Galilean moons as I through IV (counting from Jupiter outward), in part to spite his rival Simon Marius, who had proposed the names now adopted, after his own proposal to name the bodies after members of the Medici family failed to win currency. Similar numbering schemes naturally arose with the discovery of moons around Saturn and Mars. Although the numbers initially designated the moons in orbital sequence, new discoveries soon failed to conform with this scheme (e.g. &quot;Jupiter V&quot; is Amalthea, which orbits closer to Jupiter than does Io). The unstated convention then became, at the close of the 19th century, that the numbers more or less reflected the order of discovery, except for prior historical exceptions (see the Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons).

=== Geological and geographical features ===
In addition to naming planets and satellites themselves, the individual geological and geographical features such as craters, mountains, and volcanoes, on those planets and satellites also need to be named.

In the early days, only a very limited number of features could be seen on other Solar System bodies other than the Moon. Craters on the Moon could be observed with even some of the earliest telescopes, and 19th-century telescopes could make out some features on Mars. Jupiter had its famous Great Red Spot, also visible through early telescopes.

In 1919, the IAU was formed, and it appointed a committee to regularize the chaotic lunar and Martian nomenclatures then current. Much of the work was done by Mary Adela Blagg, and the report &quot;Named Lunar Formations&quot; by Blagg and Muller (1935), was the first systematic listing of lunar nomenclature. Later, &quot;The System of Lunar Craters, quadrants I, II, III, IV&quot; was published, under the direction of Gerard P. Kuiper. These works were adopted by the IAU and became the recognized sources for lunar nomenclature.

The Martian nomenclature was clarified in 1958, when a committee of the IAU recommended for adoption the names of 128 albedo features (bright, dark, or colored) observed through ground-based telescopes (IAU, 1960). These names were based on a system of nomenclature developed in the late 19th century by the Italian astronomer Giovanni V. Schiaparelli (1879) and expanded in the early 20th century by Eugene M. Antoniadi (1929), a Greek-born astronomer working at Meudon, France.

However, the age of space probes brought high-resolution images of various Solar System bodies, and it became necessary to propose naming standards for the features seen on them.

== Minor planets ==
Initially, the names given to minor planets followed the same pattern as the other planets: names from Greek or Roman myths, with a preference for female names. With the discovery in 1898 of the first body found to cross the orbit of Mars, a different choice was deemed appropriate, and 433 Eros was chosen. This started a pattern of female names for main-belt bodies and male names for those with unusual orbits.

As more and more discoveries were made over the years, this system was eventually recognized as being inadequate and a new one was devised. Currently, the responsibility for naming minor planets lies with the &quot;Working Group Small Bodies Nomenclature&quot; (WGSBN, originally the &quot;Committee Small Bodies Nomenclature&quot;, CSBN, and before that the &quot;Minor Planet Names Committee&quot;, MPNC), which is composed of 15 members, 11 of whom are voting members, while the other four are representatives for the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, the Minor Planet Center, as well as the IAU President and General Secretary. Minor planets observed over at least two nights and which cannot be identified with an existing celestial object, are initially assigned provisional designations (containing the year and the sequential order of discovery within that year) by the Minor Planet Center. When enough observations of the same object are obtained to calculate a reliable orbit, a sequential number is assigned by the Minor Planet Center to the minor-planet designation.

After the designation is assigned, the discoverer is given an opportunity to propose a name, which, if accepted by the IAU, replaces the provisional designation. Thus for instance, was given the name Ixion and is now called 28978 Ixion. The name becomes official after its publication in the &quot;WGSBN Bulletin&quot; with a brief citation explaining its significance. This may be a few years after the initial sighting, or in the case of &quot;lost&quot; asteroids, it may take several decades before they are spotted again and finally assigned a designation. If a minor planet remains unnamed ten years after it has been given a designation, the right to name it is given also to identifiers of the various apparitions of the object, to discoverers at apparitions other than the official one, to those whose observations contributed extensively to the orbit determination, or to representatives of the observatory at which the official discovery was made. The WGSBN has the right to act on its own in naming a minor planet, which often happens when the number assigned to the body is an integral number of thousands.

In recent years, automated search efforts such as LINEAR or LONEOS have discovered so many thousands of new asteroids that the WGSBN has officially limited naming to a maximum of two names per discoverer every two months. Thus, the overwhelming majority of asteroids currently discovered are not assigned formal names.

Under IAU rules, names must be pronounceable, preferably one word (such as 5535 Annefrank), although exceptions are possible (such as 9007 James Bond), and since 1982, names are limited to a maximum of 16 characters, including spaces and hyphens. (This rule was violated once for the comet-asteroid 4015 Wilson–Harrington, whose name has 17 characters; this is because it had already been named as a comet before being rediscovered as an asteroid.) Letters with diacritics are accepted, although in English the diacritical marks are usually omitted in everyday usage. 4090 Říšehvězd is an asteroid with the most diacritics (four). Military and political leaders are unsuitable unless they have been dead for at least 100 years. Names of pet animals are discouraged, but there are some from the past. Names of people, companies or products known only for success in business are not accepted, nor are citations that resemble advertising.

Whimsical names can be used for relatively ordinary asteroids (such as 26858 Misterrogers or 274301 Wikipedia), but those belonging to certain dynamical groups are expected to follow more strictly defined naming schemes.
* Near-Earth objects (such as 1862 Apollo) receive mythological names, except those associated with creation or the underworld, while distant Amor asteroid (with perihelion larger than 1.15 au) may receive non-mythical names.
* Jupiter trojans (objects in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter) are named for characters of the legendary Trojan War. Asteroids at Lagrangian point are named after Greek characters (such as 588 Achilles), whilst asteroids at are named after Trojans (such as 884 Priamus). Small Jupiter trojans with absolute magnitudes fainter than 12 (in the &quot;V&quot; band) can be named for Olympic athletes.
* Centaurs (such as 2060 Chiron) crossing or approaching the orbit of a giant planet, but not in a stabilizing resonance are named for the creatures, part horse and part man, from Greek mythology.
* Neptune trojans (objects in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Neptune, such as 385571 Otrera) are named for Amazons, with no differentiation between objects in and .
* Plutinos (such as 90482 Orcus) are named after mythological figures associated with the underworld.
* Other trans-Neptunian objects (such as 50000 Quaoar), including classical Kuiper belt objects, are given mythological or mythic names (not necessarily from Greek or Roman mythology), particularly those associated with creation.

== Comets ==
The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries. Before any systematic naming convention was adopted, comets were named in a variety of ways. The first one to be named was &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet&quot; (now officially known as Comet Halley), named after Edmond Halley, who had calculated its orbit. Similarly, the second known periodic comet, Comet Encke (formally designated 2P/Encke), was named after the astronomer, Johann Franz Encke, who had calculated its orbit rather than the original discoverer of the comet, Pierre Méchain. Other comets that bore the possessive include &quot;Biela&#x27;s Comet&quot; (3D/Biela) and &quot;Miss Herschel&#x27;s Comet&quot; (35P/Herschel–Rigollet, or Comet Herschel–Rigollet). Most bright (non-periodic) comets were referred to as &#x27;The Great Comet Of...&#x27; the year in which they appeared.

In the early 20th century, the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains today. A comet is named after its first independent discoverers, up to a maximum of three names, separated by hyphens. The IAU prefers to credit at most two discoverers, and it credits more than three discoverers only when &quot;in rare cases where named lost comets are identified with a rediscovery that has already received a new name.&quot; In recent years, many comets have been discovered by instruments operated by large teams of astronomers, and in this case, comets may be named for the instrument (for example, Comet IRAS–Araki–Alcock (C/1983 H1) was discovered independently by the IRAS satellite and amateur astronomers Genichi Araki and George Alcock). Comet 105P/Singer Brewster, discovered by Stephen Singer-Brewster, should by rights have been named &quot;105P/Singer-Brewster&quot;, but this could be misinterpreted as a joint discovery by two astronomers named Singer and Brewster, respectively, so the hyphen was replaced by a space. The spaces, apostrophes and other characters in discoverer names are preserved in comet names, like 32P/Comas Solà, 6P/d&#x27;Arrest, 53P/Van Biesbroeck, Comet van den Bergh (1974g), 66P/du Toit, or 57P/du Toit–Neujmin–Delporte.

Until 1994, the systematic naming of comets (the &quot;Old Style&quot;) involved first giving them a provisional designation of the year of their discovery followed by a lower case letter indicating its order of discovery in that year (e.g. the first Comet Bennett is 1969i, the 9th comet discovered in 1969). In 1987, more than 26 comets were discovered, so the alphabet was used again with a &quot;1&quot; subscript, very much like what is still done with asteroids (an example is Comet Skorichenko–George, 1989e1). The record year was 1989, which went as high as 1989h1. Once an orbit had been established, the comet was given a permanent designation in order of time of perihelion passage, consisting of the year followed by a Roman numeral. For example, Comet Bennett (1969i) became 1970 II.

Increasing numbers of comet discoveries made this procedure difficult to operate, and in 2003 the IAU&#x27;s Committee on Small Body Nomenclature approved a new naming system, and in its 1994 General Assembly the IAU approved a new designation system that entered into force in 1995 January 1. Comets are now designated by the year of their discovery followed by a letter indicating the half-month of the discovery (A denotes the first half of January, B denotes the second half of January, C denotes the first half of February, D denotes the second half of February, and so on) and a number indicating the order of discovery. To exemplify, the fourth comet discovered in the second half of February 2006 would be designated 2006 D4. &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are not used when describing the half of a particular month the comet was discovered. Prefixes are also added to indicate the nature of the comet, with P/ indicating a periodic comet, C/ indicating a non-periodic comet, X/ indicating a comet for which no reliable orbit could be calculated (typically comets described in historical chronicles), D/ indicating a comet that has broken up or been lost, and A/ indicating an object at first thought to be a comet but later reclassified as an asteroid (C/2017 U1 became A/2017 U1, then finally 1I/ʻOumuamua). Objects on hyperbolic orbits that do not show cometary activity also receive an A/ designation (example: A/2018 C2, which became C/2018 C2 (Lemmon) when cometary activity was detected). Periodic comets also have a number indicating the order of their discovery. Thus Bennett&#x27;s Comet has the systematic designation C/1969 Y1. Halley&#x27;s Comet, the first comet to be identified as periodic, has the systematic name 1P/1682 Q1. Comet Hale–Bopp&#x27;s systematic name is C/1995 O1. The famous Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was the ninth periodic comet jointly discovered by Carolyn Shoemaker, Eugene Shoemaker, and David Levy (the Shoemaker–Levy team has also discovered four non-periodic comets interspersed with the periodic ones), but its systematic name is D/1993 F2 (it was discovered in 1993 and the prefix &quot;D/&quot; is applied, because it was observed to crash into Jupiter).

Some comets were first spotted as minor planets, and received a temporary designation accordingly before cometary activity was later discovered. This is the reason for such comets as (Catalina 2) or (Spacewatch–LINEAR). The MPECs and HTML version of IAUCs, because of their telegraphic style, &quot;flatten out&quot; the subscripts, but the PDF version of IAUCs and some other sources such as the Yamamoto Circulars and the Kometnyj Tsirkular use them.

<doc id="538085" wikidata="Q7417428" url="?curid=538085" title="Sandy Powell (comedian)">
<text>Albert Arthur Powell MBE (30 January 1900 – 26 June 1982), known as Sandy Powell, was an English comedian best known for his radio work of the 1930s and for his catchphrase &quot;Can you hear me, mother?&quot; He first said this in a theatre in Coventry. Fifty years later, deciding he needed a rest from the business (he planned a cruise around the world with his wife, Kay White), he again said it in a Coventry theatre, for the last time.

== Early life ==
Born in Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, in 1900, he attended White&#x27;s school in Masbrough, where he helped his mother (stage name of Lily le Maine) to put on a marionette show. At age nine, she put him in a velvet suit with a lace collar and he went on stage and sang. After he left school he became a music hall entertainer, often wearing a kilt in the guise of a Scottish comedian. During this part of his career he was associated with the singer Gracie Fields, and released several records where he collaborated with her.

== Stage and recording ==
He made a total of eighty-five 78 rpm records between 1929 and 1942, mostly double-sided sketches with him in various occupations. He sold seven and a half million records, earning a penny a side, so over £60,000. The first, &quot;The Lost Policeman&quot; on the cheap Broadcast label, sold almost half a million copies (he had turned down a flat fee of £60 for this), and his subsequent recordings for Broadcast and Rex were extremely popular. He said in a 1982 interview that he used his stage work to advertise the records, rather than the other way about, though it was later said of him that his records introduced him so wherever he went to put on a show, they already knew him.

Powell&#x27;s stooge in his act during the 1930s was the boy soprano Jimmy Fletcher, father of the actor Gerard Fletcher, of &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and other TV. From 1930 he took his own revue, &quot;Sandy Powell&#x27;s Road Show&quot;, on tour – it ran for ten years and was extremely popular despite having only a handful of performers and two backdrops.

== Radio and film ==
In the 1930s he began to work on the radio, always introducing his show with the catchphrase &quot;Can you hear me, mother?&quot; Powell said that the catchphrase originated on an occasion when he had dropped his script and was killing time at the microphone while rearranging the pages. It is also attributed to his mother&#x27;s coercion and her hardness of hearing, during his early career. At his next booking, the theatre manager asked him to say it again as everyone was saying it now. He also appeared in a number of films during the 1930s, usually as himself, with one of them actually referring to his catchphrase: &quot;Can You Hear Me, Mother?&quot; (1935). In 1939, he was voted the fifth most popular British star at the local box office.

A popular figure, he worked continually on radio, television and pantomime through the 1940s and 1950s. Aged 21 at the time, Pat Phoenix was brought in to play Sandy&#x27;s wife and played four parts in the film. After that he went onto a variety tour and she came with him as his wife, earning £12 a week. He performed with his Starlight company in the Eastbourne Pier theatre for over fifteen seasons in the 1950s and 1960s, earning himself the sobriquet Mr Eastbourne, and he was still performing occasionally up to his death in 1982. Part of his act was a comedy ventriloquism act, where the dummy would fall apart. After being on stage for a few weeks with a series of awful ventriloquists, he bought a dummy himself and did his own act as a ventriloquist. When Pat Phoenix as his wife who &quot;fed him lines&quot; asked if the dummy could sing something, he replied &quot;If I know it, he can sing it!&quot; His real-life wife, Kay White, often appeared with him.

He performed twice in a Royal Variety Performance: both 1935 and 1970. In the latter he appeared with his wife performing his ventriloquist act gone-wrong.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1971 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. He was awarded the MBE in 1975.

==Death==
For a day or two, he thought he had bad indigestion, but it was worse than he realised and he died of a heart attack in Eastbourne on 26 June 1982, aged 82.

A pub in Powell&#x27;s native Rotherham was named &quot;The Comedian&quot; in his honour. On 13 April 2015 a blue plaque commemorating Powell was erected by the British Music Hall Society and unveiled by the then President Roy Hudd at Powell&#x27;s former home in Elms Avenue, Eastbourne.

==Marriages==

In 1942 he married Katie Hughes, who died in 1947. He married Kay White in 1951.

<text>Hel (; ) is a seaside resort city in Puck County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, located on the tip of the Hel Peninsula, some from the Polish mainland.

== History ==

=== Early developments ===
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century, under its first historic ruler Mieszko I. The Kashubian village of Hel was first mentioned in 1198 as a centre of herring trade area named &quot;Gellen&quot;. In one of the Danish chronicles of 1219 it is mentioned that a damaged ship of King Valdemar II the Victorious was set ashore on an &quot;Island of Hel&quot;. By the 13th century the village became one of the most important trade centres of the area, competing with the nearby city of Gdańsk. It was then that the village was granted town rights by Duke Świętopełk II the Great of Pomerania. The privileges were again confirmed in 1378 when the town came under the rule of the Teutonic Order.

Initially the town was some from its present-day centre. It contained a church, hospital, city house, two market places, several guest houses and a small port. However, during the 15th century the peninsula started to shrink through marine erosion and soon the town was moved to a safer place. In 1417 St Peter&#x27;s Church was built in the town, devoted to the patron saint of fishermen. Hel experienced a period of growth, but was later left behind by the faster-growing city of Danzig (Gdańsk). In 1440, the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, upon the request of which the area was re-incorporated by King Casimir IV Jagiellon into the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. The re-incorporation was confirmed in the 1466 peace treaty, when the Teutonic Knights renounced any claims to the area. In 1466 Casimir IV granted the town as a fief to the city of Gdańsk, which ended the century-long struggle for economic domination over Gdańsk Bay. In 1526 King Sigismund I the Old withdrew all privileges previously granted to Hel and sold the town and the peninsula to the city authorities of Gdańsk. Since then Hel&#x27;s fate was tied to the fortunes of its bigger neighbour.

In the 17th and 18th centuries prolonged warfare and a series of natural disasters severely damaged the town. It was severely depopulated, and in 1793 it was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland. In 1872 the government of the newly formed German Empire abolished the town rights granted to Hel six centuries previously. After that the village of Hela (as it is called in German) lost much of its significance.

=== Modern times ===
The period of decline was halted in 1893 when a fishing harbour was built in the village. It provided a shelter for fishing vessels, but also became a popular destination for weekend trips of the inhabitants of Danzig and Zoppot (Sopot). In 1896 the village was granted the status of a sea-side resort.

As a result of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles Poland was re-established as an independent nation. Hel, before the war a predominantly German village (93% in 1905), became again part of Poland. In 1921 a new railway was built along the peninsula connecting the town to the mainland. The authorities of the Pomeranian Voivodeship also planned to build a road to the village, but the peninsula was found too narrow at the time. Soon Hel became one of the most important tourism centres in Polish Pomerania. New suburbs of villas were built for tourists, as well as a new church, school, fishing institute and geophysical observatory. In addition, the village became one of the two main naval bases of the Polish Navy. The harbour was expanded and in 1936 the president declared the peninsula a &quot;Fortified Area&quot; under jurisdiction of the Polish Army. The naval base was expanded significantly and a battery of coastal artillery was built to provide cover for the military facilities.

During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the Hel Peninsula was one of the longest-defended pockets of Polish Army resistance. Approximately 3,000 soldiers of the Coastal Defence Group (&quot;Grupa Obrony Wybrzeża&quot;) units under Kmdr Włodzimierz Steyer defended the area until 2 October 1939. Shortly before capitulation, Polish military engineers detonated a number of torpedo warheads, which separated the peninsula from the mainland transforming it into an island. Afterwards, Hel was occupied by Germany. Already in 1939, the occupiers carried out the first expulsion of Poles, who were then enslaved as forced labour of new German colonists in various places in the region. During the occupation, the Kriegsmarine used the Hel naval base to train U-boat crews. At the end of the war the village was the last part of Polish soil to be liberated: the German units encircled there only surrendered on 14 May 1945, six days after Germany had capitulated.

After the war the village yet again became a naval base. In 1960 a road linking Hel with Jastarnia on the mainland was built. Three years later town rights were reintroduced. Since then the tourist industry started to recover and several hotels, guest houses and inns were built. In 1996 the Polish Navy sold all remaining parts of the peninsula to the civilian authorities and only a small naval base is there today.

The harbour now serves primarily as a yacht marina, though there are some fishing boats and ferries to Gdańsk, Sopot and Gdynia in the summer.

==Sights and culture==
Hel houses a sea life biological laboratory and there are interesting examples of naval armament and equipment exhibited throughout the town. There is popular beach along the shore between the inner and outer harbour walls, with a seal sanctuary (the Fokarium) just behind it. There is a that forms part of the National Maritime Museum, Gdańsk in an old church on the sea front.

The most easterly edge of Hel, which was once a military territory, can now be accessed by the general public making it possible to walk all the way around the peninsula.

Hel is the setting for the Polish crime series &quot;&quot; (2014–2015) &quot;The Crime&quot; in English.

==Transport==
The road leading to the town has been jokingly referred to by tourists and locals as the road as the &quot;highway to Hel&quot;, with the local summer bus service happening to be numbered 666. However, due to criticism from religious groups over its associations with the number of the beast, the service was renumbered 669 in 2023.

== Climate ==
Hel has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Its peninsular location generates a unique climate in Poland and more similar with the northwest of Europe.

==Career==
Henry succeeded his father as Earl of Somerset on 16 March 1410. During his minority his mother held his lands for him until he reached the age of 15.

==Death and succession==
He died aged sixteen at the Siege of Rouen during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, where he fought under the command of his uncle Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, 3rd Earl of Somerset (1404-1444).

<doc id="538096" wikidata="Q5606" url="?curid=538096" title="Hel Peninsula">
<text>Hel Peninsula (; ; ; or &quot;Putziger Nehrung&quot;) is a sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. It is located in Puck County of the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

== Name ==
The name of the peninsula might come from either the Old Polish word &quot;hyl&quot;/&quot;hel&quot;, meaning &quot;empty or exposed place&quot;, or the Germanic word &quot;heel&quot;, which is derived from the form of the peninsula and the fact that the area was first settled by the Goths, an East Germanic tribe.

== Geography ==
The width of the peninsula varies from approximately near Jurata to in the most narrow part to over at the tip. Since the peninsula is formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century, the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only in the summer.

A road and a railroad run along the peninsula from the mainland to the town at the furthest point, Hel, a popular tourist destination. Other towns, ports, and tourist resorts are Jurata, Jastarnia, Kuźnica, Chałupy, and Władysławowo.

Bus transport on the peninsula consists of only one route, the 669. The 
route was originally numbered 666, which played on the biblical number of the beast and the similarity of the name &quot;Hel&quot; to the English word &quot;hell&quot;. This raised complaints from Catholic groups which found the numbering blasphemous. The number was changed in 2023.

== Military importance ==
The Hel Peninsula was part of Prussia and then Germany from 1772 to 1919, during which time it was known by its German name . After the peninsula became part of the Second Polish Republic after World War I, it acquired considerable military significance as part of the Polish Corridor and was turned into a fortified region, with a garrison of about 3,000. In the course of the Battle of Hel in 1939, Polish forces dynamited the peninsula at one point and turned it into an island.

During the years of German occupation of Poland (1939–1945), Hel&#x27;s defenses were further expanded, and a battery of three 40.6 cm SK C/34 gun was constructed, but the guns were soon moved to the Atlantic Wall in occupied France. Hel peninsula remained in German hands until the end of World War II, when the defending forces surrendered on 14 May 1945, six days after Germany capitulated.

After the war, when the peninsula again became part of Poland, it continued to have military significance, with much of its area reserved for military use. Additional gun batteries were built in the 1940s and the 1950s. Many of the fortifications and batteries are open to tourists today, but some areas of the peninsula still belong to the Polish Armed Forces.

<text>Korčula () is a Croatian island in the Adriatic Sea. It has an area of , is long and on average wide, and lies just off the Dalmatian coast. Its 15,522 inhabitants (2011) make it the second most populous Adriatic island after Krk. The population are almost entirely ethnic Croats (95.74%). The island is twinned with Rothesay in Scotland. It is known for Grk, a white wine that is only produced on the island and not exported due to limited production.

==Geography==

The island of Korčula belongs to the central Dalmatian archipelago, separated from the Pelješac peninsula by a narrow Strait of Pelješac, between wide. It stretches in the east–west direction, in length of ; on average, it is wide. With an area of , it is the sixth largest Adriatic island. The highest peaks are &quot;Klupca&quot;, and &quot;Kom&quot;, high.

Main settlements on the island are towns of Korčula, Blato and Vela Luka. Villages along the coast are Brna, Račišće, Lumbarda and Prižba; Žrnovo, Pupnat, Smokvica and Čara are located inland. The island is divided into municipalities of Korčula, Smokvica, Blato and Lumbarda. The climate is Mediterranean; an average air temperature in January is and in July ; the average annual rainfall is . The island is largely covered with Mediterranean flora including extensive pine forests.

The main road runs along the spine of the island connecting all settlements from Lumbarda on the eastern to Vela Luka on the western end, with the exception of Račišće, which is served by a separate road running along the northern coast. Ferries connect the town of Korčula with Orebić on the Pelješac peninsula. Another line connects Vela Luka with Split and the island of Lastovo. Fast passenger catamarans connect those two ports with Split, Dubrovnik and the islands of Hvar, Lastovo and Mljet.

==History==
===Ancient history===
According to legend, the island was founded by Trojan hero Aeneas or his friend Antenor.

The island was first settled by Mesolithic and Neolithic peoples. There is archaeological evidence at the sites of Vela Spila and at Jakas Cave near the village of Žrnovo. The findings at Vela Spila are on display at the Center for Culture in Vela Luka. The fate of these peoples is not known but the sites do provide a window into their way of life.

The second wave of human settlement was by Illyrians, documented around 1,000 BC. They were semi-nomadic tribal people living from agriculture. There are numerous old stone buildings and fortresses (&quot;gradine&quot;) left behind by the Illyrians.

&quot;Melaina Korkyra&quot; () was the ancient Cnidian Greek colony founded on Korčula. Greek colonists from Corfu formed a colony on the island in the 6th century B.C. The Greeks named it &quot;Black Korkyra&quot; after their homeland and the dense pine-woods on the island. Greek artifacts, including carved marble tombstones can be found at the local Korčula town museum.

A stone inscription found in Lumbarda (Lumbarda Psephisma) and which is the oldest written stone monument in Croatia, records that Greek settlers from Issa (Vis) founded another colony on the island in the 3rd century BC. The two communities lived peacefully until the Illyrian Wars (220 BC to 219 BC) with the Romans.

The island became part of the Roman province of Illyricum after the Illyrian Wars. Roman migration followed and Roman citizens arrived on the island. Roman villas appeared through the territory of Korčula and there is evidence of an organised agricultural exploitation of the land. There are archaeological remains of Roman Junianum on the island and old church foundations.

In 10 AD, Illyricum was split into two provinces, Pannonia and Dalmatia. Korčula became part of the ancient Roman province of Dalmatia.

===Middle Ages===

In the 6th century it came under Byzantine rule. The Great Migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries brought Slavic invasions into this region. Along the Dalmatian coast the Slavic peoples including the Croats poured out of the interior and seized control of the area of the Neretva Delta, as well as the island of Korčula, which protects the river mouth. The Christianisation of the Croats began in the 9th century, but the early Croatian rural inhabitants of the island may well have fully accepted Christianity only later; in the early Middle Ages the Croatian population of the island was grouped with the pagan Narentines or Neretvians, who quickly learned maritime skills in this new environment and became engaged in piracy against Venetian trade ships.

Initially, Venetian merchants were willing to pay an annual tribute to keep their shipping safe from the infamous Neretvian pirates of the Dalmatian coast. After the 9th century, the island was briefly under nominal Byzantine suzerainty. In 998 the Principality of Pagania came under Venetian control. Doge Pietro II Orseolo launched a naval expedition along the coast and assumed the title Duke of Dalmatia. Afterwards Korčula came under the control of the Great Principality of Zachlumia.

In the 12th century Korčula was conquered by a Venetian nobleman, Pepone Zorzi, and incorporated briefly into the Republic of Venice. Around this time, the local Korčula rulers began to exercise diplomacy and legislate a town charter to secure the independence of the island, particularly with regard to internal affairs, given its powerful neighbors.
The brothers of Stephen Nemanja, Miroslav and Stracimir, launched an attack on the island on 10 August 1184, raiding its fertile western part. The island&#x27;s inhabitants called for help from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), which in turn captured all of Stracimir&#x27;s galleys.

The Statute of Korčula was first drafted in 1214. It guaranteed the relative autonomy of the island against her outside rulers including the semi-independent Grand Principality of Zachlumia, the Grand Principality of Serbia, the Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia and the Republics of Ragusa and Venice. Captains were created for each of the island&#x27;s five settlements for organized defence. Korčula had fewer than 2,500 inhabitants at that time.

In 1221, Pope Honorius III gave the island to the Princes of Krka (the Šubić family). During the 13th century the hereditary Counts of Korčula were loosely governed in turn by the Hungarian crown and by the Republic of Genoa but also enjoyed a brief period of independence. In 1255, however, Marsilio Zorzi conquered the island&#x27;s capital and razed or damaged some of its churches in the process, forcing the Counts to return to Venetian suzerainty.

What is more definite is that in 1298 the Republic of Genoa defeated Venice in the documented Battle of Curzola off the coast of Korčula and a galley commander, Marco Polo, was taken prisoner by the victors to eventually spend his time in a Genoese prison writing of his travels. However, some Italian scholars believe that he may have been captured in a minor clash near Ayas.

After the writings of Pope Martin IV in 1284 and Pope Honorius IV in 1286 to the Archbishop of Ragusa, the Archbishop installed a certain Petar as Bishop of Ston and Korčula – &quot;stacnensis ac Crozolensis&quot;. In 1291, Ivan Kručić was in Korčula&#x27;s city as the Bishop of Korčula. Kručić contested his overlord, the Archbishop of Hvar, and wanted to unite Ston with his church domain. In 1300, Pope Boniface VIII finally founded the Korčula Bishopric under the Archbishopric of Ragusa. In 1333, as the Republic of Ragusa purchased Ston with Pelješac from the Serbian Empire, the suzerainty of Ston&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church with the peninsula was given to the Bishopric of Korčula.

Curzola, as the Venetians called the island, surrendered to the Kingdom of Hungary in 1358 according to the Treaty of Zadar, but it surrendered to the Bosnian King Stephen Tvrtko I in the summer of 1390. However the Kingdom of Hungary restored rule of the island, and in December 1396 Croatian-Hungarian King Sigismund gave it to Đurađ II Stracimirović of the Balšić dynasty of Zeta, who kept it up to his death in 1403, when it was returned under the Hungarian crown. In 1409 it again became a part of the Republic of Venice, purchased by the neighbouring Republic of Venice in 1413–1417, it still declared itself subjected to Venice in 1420. In 1571 it defended itself so gallantly against the Ottoman attackers at the Battle of Lepanto that it obtained the designation &quot;Fidelissima&quot; from Pope Pius V.

===Venetian and Austrian rule===

Korčula had for years supplied the timber for the wooden walls of Venice, and had been a favourite station of her fleets. From 1776 to 1797 Korčula succeeded Hvar as the main Venetian fortified arsenal in this region. According to the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 in which the Republic of Venice was divided between the French Republic and the Habsburg monarchy, Korčula passed on to the Habsburg monarchy.

The French Empire invaded the island in 1806, joining it to the Illyrian Provinces. The Montenegrin Forces of &quot;vladika&quot; Petar I Petrović-Njegoš conquered the island with Russian naval assistance in 1807 during his attempt to construct another Serbian Empire. The defeat of Austria however at the Battle of Wagram in 1809 had put most of the Adriatic under French control. On 4 February 1813 however, British troops and naval forces under Thomas Fremantle captured the island from the French. This short period of British rule left an important mark on the island; the new stone West quay was built, as well as a semi-circular paved terrace with stone benches on the newly built road towards Lumbarda, and a circular Martello tower, &quot;forteca&quot; on the St. Blaise&#x27;s Hill above the town. According to the terms of the Congress of Vienna, the British left the island to the Austrian Empire in the 19th of July of 1815. Korčula accordingly became a part of the Austrian crown land of Dalmatia. From 1867, Korčula was in the Cisleithanian part of Austria-Hungary.

===20th century===

During the World War I, the island and other territories were promised to the Kingdom of Italy in the 1915 Treaty of London in return for Italy joining the war on the side of Great Britain and France. However, after the war, Korčula and the rest of Dalmatia became a part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in 1918. It was ruled by Italy from 1918 to 1921. It became part of the Province of Dalmatia, before becoming part of the Dubrovnik Oblast in 1922. Later, it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, known from 1929 on as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The island became part of the Littoral Banovina in 1929 and in 1939 it became a part of the autonomous Banovina of Croatia.

After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Italy annexed the island. After the Armistice of Cassibile between Italy and the Allied powers in September 1943, it was briefly held by the Yugoslav Partisans who enjoyed considerable support in the region. Korčula was then occupied by German forces which controlled the island until their withdrawal in September 1944. With the liberation of Yugoslavia in 1945, the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was formed, and Korčula became a part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia, one of the six Yugoslav republics. The state changed the name to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1953, and so did the Republic to Socialist Republic of Croatia. After 1991, the island became a part of the independent Republic of Croatia.

==Culture==
The 17th century saw the rise of Petar Kanavelić who wrote love songs, occasional epic poems and dramas. He also translated from Italian the major poetic works of that time. He is regarded as one of the greatest Croatian writers of the 17th century. In 1673 he became the representative of the Korčula community in Venice. There is a primary school named after him in the town of Korčula.

Moreška is a traditional sword dance from the town of Korčula. It is one of the many proud traditional sword dances that are performed on the island. It arrived in Korčula around the 16th century. Korčula has a rich musical history of &quot;klape&quot; groups. &quot;Klapa&quot; is a form of a cappella style of singing. The tradition goes back centuries, but the style as we know it today, originated in the 19th century.

Korčula has a tradition of stonemasonry, which reached its peak during the rule of the Republic of Venice (1420–1797). The island also has a very strong art tradition.

===Festivals===

====Korkyra Baroque Festival====
The Korkyra Baroque Festival is an annual international event, launched in 2012. The festival showcases a selection of the world&#x27;s leading ensembles and soloists specialized in Baroque music. Over ten days a series of concerts and supporting events focus on Baroque music, promoting the richness of Korčula&#x27;s cultural monuments and the whole town as a unique architectural treasure.
==Transport==


Korčula is linked to the mainland by a regular ferry service that runs between Dominče, just outside the town of Korčula and Orebić. There are numerous other local ferry services including one linking Vela Luka and Lastovo. The main Croatian ferry operator Jadrolinija runs a service linking Korčula Town with Rijeka, Split, Hvar, Mljet, Dubrovnik and (from May to September) Bari. An operator Linijska Nacionalna Plovidba runs a seasonal service linking Korčula with Drvenik.

There are also bus services that link the island to major cities on the mainland, which reach Korčula using the Orebić ferry service.

Korčula town also has mooring facilities. The western harbour gives shelter from wind though not against the bora and north-westerlies. Boat owners are advised to shift to the eastern harbour or to Luka Cove. The port is open to international seaborne traffic as a permanent port of entry; it offers all types of repairs to hulls and engines at the Brodograditelj Shipyard.

<text>William Thomas Berry (born July 31, 1958) is an American musician who was the drummer for the alternative rock band R.E.M. Although best known for his economical drumming style, Berry also played other instruments, including guitar, bass guitar and piano, both for songwriting and on R.E.M. albums. In 1995, Berry suffered a ruptured cerebral aneurysm onstage and collapsed. After a successful recovery he left the music industry two years later to become a farmer, and has since maintained a low profile, making sporadic reunions with R.E.M. and appearing on other artists&#x27; recordings. His departure made him the only member of the band to not remain with them during their entire run. Berry eventually returned to the industry in 2022.

==Early years (1958–1980)==
William Thomas Berry was born on July 31, 1958, in Duluth, Minnesota, the fifth child of Don and Anna Berry. At the age of three, Berry moved with his family to Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee, where they would remain for the next seven years. In 1968, they moved again, this time to Sandusky, Ohio.

In 1972, the Berry family made their final move, to Macon, Georgia, just in time for Bill to start high school at Northeast High School. It was there that he met bass guitarist Mike Mills, and they played together in several different bands, including Shadowfax. Their first attempt at a career in music was short-lived. He and Mills decided to make money by getting day jobs. They rented an apartment on Arlington Place in Macon, and Bill landed a job at the Paragon Booking Agency next door.

Berry and Mills moved to Athens, Georgia, in late 1978, where they met Michael Stipe and Peter Buck. Prior to dropping out, Berry studied pre-law at the University of Georgia.

==R.E.M. years (1980–1997)==

R.E.M. was formed in 1980. In addition to his duties as a drummer, Berry contributed occasional guitar, bass, mandolin, vocals, keyboards and piano on studio tracks. In concert, he sometimes performed on bass, and supplied regular backing vocals. Berry also made notable songwriting contributions, particularly for &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, both from &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;. Other Berry songs included &quot;Perfect Circle&quot;, &quot;Driver 8&quot;, &quot;Cant Get There from Here&quot; and &quot;I Took Your Name&quot;. The song &quot;Leave&quot; was also written by Berry for R.E.M.&#x27;s album &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; (1996), which was his last album with the band.

Berry was also responsible for toning down the lyrics of the song &quot;Welcome to the Occupation.&quot; Stipe&#x27;s original lyric was &quot;hang your freedom fighters&quot; which, given the Reagan administration&#x27;s active support for the Nicaraguan contra &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, sounded violent and militant, although Stipe himself countered that the line could be taken multiple ways (&quot;hang&quot; as in either &quot;lynch&quot; or &quot;frame on a wall&quot;). Berry&#x27;s objection ultimately led the line to be changed to &quot;hang your freedom higher.&quot;

&quot;A lot of [Bill&#x27;s] stuff is under under-known, under-appreciated, under-rated,&quot; said Mills in 2024. &quot;He&#x27;s a great singer; he comes up with some amazing melodies that I would never have thought of, and ways to sing it that I would never have thought of.&quot;

During 1984, Berry also was drummer for the impromptu Hindu Love Gods, which featured his R.E.M. bandmates Peter Buck, Mike Mills, rocker Warren Zevon, and Bryan Cook.

===On-stage collapse and leaving R.E.M. (1995–1997)===
On March 1, 1995, at the Patinoire Auditorium in Lausanne, Switzerland, Berry collapsed on stage during an R.E.M. show from a ruptured brain aneurysm. He recovered and rejoined the band, but left in October 1997, saying that he no longer had the drive or enjoyment level to be in the band, and that he wanted to not travel. He later explained on VH-1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;: I didn&#x27;t wake up one day and decide, &quot;I just can&#x27;t stand these guys anymore&quot; or anything. I feel like I&#x27;m ready for a life change. I&#x27;m still young enough that I can do something else. I&#x27;ve been pounding the tubs since I was nine years old ... I&#x27;m ready to do something else.

Acquiescing to Berry&#x27;s wishes, R.E.M. announced that it would reluctantly continue as a three-piece outfit. They continued to tour with several accompanying musicians, including long-time sidemen Ken Stringfellow and Scott McCaughey and employed Joey Waronker and Bill Rieflin as live drummers over the next decade.

In 2024, when asked if he regretted leaving the band, Berry said: &quot;Of course I did. That was a weird time for me. And I made it weird for these guys too.&quot; He added that his aneurysm lowered his energy level. &quot;I was Type A, hyperactive, until that. And I just didn’t have the drive I once did to do this. I didn&#x27;t regret [leaving] at the time; I sort of regretted it a little later.&quot;

==Semi-retirement (1997–2022)==
Berry left the music business and became a farmer, working on his hay farm in Farmington, Georgia, near Athens in late 1997.

Prior to the group&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Berry granted his first interview in several years, discussing life after retirement. &quot;It&#x27;s a great chance to get back together and perform with R.E.M., which I always loved doing&quot;, he said.

Asked where he goes on vacations, in an interview at his home in 2019, Berry stated: &quot;I would &quot;never&quot; go on vacation. Vacation for me is right here. I spent enough time in airports and in vans and on buses. I kind of like sitting still for a while. Still haven&#x27;t grown tired of that.&quot; He ventures in to Athens to &quot;see shows I want; I don&#x27;t just go out and hang out at bars.&quot; He added: &quot;I get into shows about 1.6 times a month: maybe not twice a month, but more than once.&quot;

Berry maintains that he never enjoyed being a drummer. &quot;It&#x27;s just not the most musical instrument. I&#x27;ve never written a song on a set of drums.&quot; His preferred instrument is the acoustic guitar, which (as of 2019) is something he plays every day. &quot;I wish I&#x27;d played more of it before I retired. I&#x27;ve done most of my practising after I&#x27;ve retired. I&#x27;ve become a pretty good guitarist now; I wasn&#x27;t then.&quot;

His musical activities after leaving R.E.M. have been sporadic, but did include recording for the Tourette Syndrome Charity Album &quot;Welcome Companions&quot; in 2000. On May 11, 2018, he performed at the Winterville Auditorium in Winterville, Georgia, as part of a quintet named Mayor Ferrelle and the Councilmen, formed by the band&#x27;s vocalist and lead guitarist, city mayor Dodd Ferrelle. The other three members were John Kean, David Barbe and Adam Poulin.

Berry appeared in the 2020 &quot;Song Exploder&quot; documentary about the band&#x27;s song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, even playing part of his drum line from the song. In the same documentary, Peter Buck says, &quot;There&#x27;s no drummer like Bill Berry on Earth. None. I have a lot of drummer friends, and they all ask me the same thing: &#x27;What&#x27;s his secret?&#x27; And I can&#x27;t tell you, because I don&#x27;t know. My theory is that he uses the space between the high hat and the snare drum in a kind of disco-y way, without being too disco.&quot;

In 1999, Joey Waronker explained the process of how he learned Berry&#x27;s drum parts. He had learned around fifty of R.E.M.&#x27;s songs. &quot;I think we have about 40 that we’re rotating amongst. I had to make a book — just notes — on every song. It&#x27;s really, really subtle rhythmically. There&#x27;s a lot going on, and I never noticed it. I&#x27;m a drummer, and never picked up on it. I was listening to the songs, saying, &#x27;These are definitely not straightforward.&#x27;&quot;

== Return to the music industry (2022–present) ==
In 2022, twenty-five years after his departure from R.E.M., Berry formed a new supergroup called The Bad Ends with Athens- and Atlanta-based musicians Mike Mantione of Five Eight on guitar and vocals, Dave Domizi on bass and vocals, Geoff Melkonian on keyboards and vocals, Christian Lopez on guitars and mandolin, and Berry on drums and backing vocals. The origins of the group are a chance meeting between Mike Mantione and Berry on a street in Athens. Mantione had recently been described by Peter Buck as &quot;the unsung hero of Athens rock and roll&quot; and offered Berry &quot;an opportunity to play in the game again&quot;, as in playing music professionally.

The group have released one single and video called &quot;All Your Friends Are Dying&quot; and performed a hometown show on November 27, 2022. They released their debut album, &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, on January 20, 2023.

On February 8, 2024, Berry joined the Michael Shannon / Jason Narducy band on stage at the 40 Watt Club in Athens to perform the piano part in &quot;Perfect Circle&quot;, the song that R.E.M. had resumed performing and dedicated to Berry after he left the band in the mid 1990s.

==Personal life==
On March 22, 1986, Berry married girlfriend Mari Berry. They divorced in 1997. When crack began to infiltrate Athens in the early 1990s, the couple moved to nearby Farmington. &quot;In 1988, I decided that I would broaden my portfolio, which was pretty slim back then. It&#x27;s not like I was rolling in dough,&quot; he explained in 2019. &quot;I wanted to buy land and found this spot. It&#x27;s sixty acres, and it&#x27;s far enough outside of town that it was cheap. It was, like, $2,000/acre back in &#x27;88. Land&#x27;s more like $10–$12,000 now. It was strictly an investment; I was going to sell it later.&quot; His farm, which includes sheep, is at the north end of his property. A caretaker works on the farm; Berry does not anymore. He has a garden, but his caretaker also looks after that. &quot;I get the rewards of it, but he does all the work.&quot;

In 2003, Berry and Cybele Lange had a son.

Berry was an avid golfer while a member of R.E.M.

<doc id="538114" wikidata="Q3931581" url="?curid=538114" title="Alicia Ann Spottiswoode">
<text>Alicia Ann, Lady John Scott (&quot;née&quot; Spottiswoode; 24 June 1810 – 12 March 1900) was a Scottish songwriter and composer known chiefly for the tune, &quot;Annie Laurie,&quot; to which the words of a 17th-century poet, William Douglas, were set.

==Life==
She was the oldest daughter of John Spottiswoode of Berwickshire and his wife Helen Wauchope of Niddrie Marischal. On 16 March 1836 she married Lord John Scott, a younger son of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, and consequently was known as Lady John Scott. Lord John Scott died in 1860. Under the will of her father, she resumed her maiden name Spottiswoode in 1866, and was sometimes known as Lady John Scott Spottiswoode.

Lady John Scott was a champion of traditional Scots language, history and culture, her motto being &#x27;Haud [hold] fast by the past&#x27;. One of her best known works, &quot;Annie Laurie,&quot; was published in 1838. Scott was born at Spottiswoode, Scottish Borders, in the former Berwickshire and died there on 12 March 1900.

Her compositions were published by Paterson &amp; Roy, and included:

<doc id="538118" wikidata="Q289952" url="?curid=538118" title="Sandy Powell (costume designer)">
<text>Sandy Powell (born 7 April 1960) is a British costume designer. In a career spanning over three decades, she is recognized for her prolific work across independent films and blockbusters. She has received numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and two Costume Designers Guild Awards. She has been the recipient of various honorary awards, including the BAFTA Fellowship in 2023. Powell was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours for services to costume design.

Powell is best known for her collaborations with directors Derek Jarman, Neil Jordan, Todd Haynes and Martin Scorsese. She has received 15 nominations for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design and has won three times for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2009). She has also been nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design a record 16 times and had three wins for &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (1998), &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, and &quot;The Favourite&quot; (2018).

== Early life and education ==
Powell was born in London in 1960, and grew up in Brixton and Clapham. Her father worked in casinos, while her mother was a secretary. Powell told fashion journalist Suzy Menkes in an episode of Menkes&#x27; podcast &quot;Creative Conversations&quot; that, despite their close friendship, she was not related to fellow costume designer Anthony Powell. Information about them being cousins has falsely spread online. Powell learned to sew from her mother on a Singer sewing machine, drew pictures of clothes, designed and made outfits for her dolls, and started making her own clothes from a young age. She also developed an interest in film and theatre from an early age.

Powell attended Sydenham High School, and in 1978 she completed an art foundation course at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, where she became acquainted with Lea Anderson, who later became a dancer and choreographer as well as Powell&#x27;s collaborator. In 1979, Powell began a BA in theatre design at the Central School of Art and Design, but left after two years before completing her degree and started working for fringe theatre companies.

== Career ==
=== 1980–1997: Early work ===

After leaving Central, Powell began a working relationship with dancer and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, whom she greatly admired. She designed costumes for his productions, the first of which was the show &quot;Nijinsky&quot; at La Scala in Milan. In the early 1980s, Powell became acquainted with filmmaker Derek Jarman, who became a mentor and an influential figure in her life. Following Jarman&#x27;s advice, she spent a year working on music videos. She made her entry into the film industry in 1986, designing costumes for the Jarman film &quot;Caravaggio&quot;.

In 1992, Powell achieved prominence in the period drama film &quot;Orlando&quot;, directed by Sally Potter. Operating on a limited budget, Powell created elaborate costumes for the gender-switching and time-traveling protagonist (played by Tilda Swinton), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design. Powell also began a collaboration with director Neil Jordan, which would produce a total of six films including the crime thriller &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1992), the gothic horror film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994) and the period drama &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996).

=== 1998–2017: Breakthrough ===
Powell received dual nominations at the 71st Academy Awards for her two 1998 films, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. Echoing the contemporary tone of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, Powell opted to sacrifice historical accuracy in her costume designs but still managed to achieve &quot;emotional accuracy&quot;, according to &quot;Salon&quot; critic Stephanie Zacharek. The detail on the costumes of Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s Viola and the thematic significance of her costume changes were also noted as highlights of the film. For her work in the film, Powell won her first Academy Award for Best Costume Design.
Following her win at the 71st Academy Awards, Powell began her collaboration with director Martin Scorsese, starting with his 2002 epic period drama film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, for which she earned her 5th Oscar nomination. The two reunited for the 2004 biographical drama film &quot;The Aviator&quot;, for which Powell won her second Academy Award. In 2005 she worked on Stephen Frears&#x27; &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot; earning another Academy Award nomination. She worked on Scorsese gain this time for a film set in modern-day creating current day clothing for the Boston crime drama &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson. She then worked on the historical romantic drama &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; which was based on 2001 novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory. The film was directed by Justin Chadwick and starred Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman, and Eric Bana.

In 2009, She worked on the romantic period drama &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. The film starred Emily Blunt as Queen Victoria, and the film revolves around her upbringing and romance with Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha portrayed by Rupert Friend. She won her third Academy Award for Best Costume Design, and a BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design for her work on the film. The following year she worked on Scorsese&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Shutter Island&quot; starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Julie Taymor&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; with Helen Mirren. In 2011 she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design her work on Scorsese&#x27;s children&#x27;s action adventure film &quot;Hugo&quot; losing to Mark Bridges for &quot;The Artist&quot; (2011).
In 2016, Powell received her second dual nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, having been recognized for her works in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Disney live-action adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and for Todd Haynes&#x27; romantic drama &quot;Carol&quot; (2015). The later was based on the Patricia Highsmith novel &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; (1952). The film starred Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as starcrossed lovers in the 1950s. She reunited with Haynes for the black and white film &quot;Wonderstruck&quot; (2017) starring Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams, based on the 2011 novel of the same name by Brian Selznick. She also served as an executive producer on the film. That same year, she worked on the John Cameron Mitchell&#x27;s wacky science fiction romantic comedy &quot;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&quot; (2017).

=== 2018–present ===
In 2019, Powell garnered her third dual nominations at the 91st Academy Awards for her works in Yorgos Lanthimos&#x27; &quot;The Favourite&quot; (2018) and Rob Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018), making her the most nominated costume designer in Academy Awards history after Edith Head. In 2020, Powell received her 15th Oscar nomination in her seventh collaboration with Martin Scorsese in his epic crime film &quot;The Irishman&quot; starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. She shared the nomination with her co-designer, Christopher Peterson.

In the same year, Powell collected many stars&#x27; signatures on a cream calico suit in a widely publicized tour of 2020 awards ceremonies, including the 92nd Academy Awards and 73rd British Academy Film Awards, to be auctioned to raise funds for the preservation of director Derek Jarman&#x27;s home, Prospect Cottage.

<text>A vanishing point is a point on the image plane of a perspective rendering where the two-dimensional perspective projections of parallel lines in three-dimensional space appear to converge. When the set of parallel lines is perpendicular to a picture plane, the construction is known as one-point perspective, and their vanishing point corresponds to the oculus, or &quot;eye point&quot;, from which the image should be viewed for correct perspective geometry. Traditional linear drawings use objects with one to three sets of parallels, defining one to three vanishing points.
Italian humanist polymath and architect Leon Battista Alberti first introduced the concept in his treatise on perspective in art, &quot;De pictura&quot;, written in 1435. Straight railroad tracks are a familiar modern example.

== Vector notation ==

The vanishing point may also be referred to as the &quot;direction point&quot;, as lines having the same directional vector, say &quot;D&quot;, will have the same vanishing point. Mathematically, let be a point lying on the image plane, where is the focal length (of the camera associated with the image), and let be the unit vector associated with , where . If we consider a straight line in space with the unit vector and its vanishing point , the unit vector associated with is equal to , assuming both point towards the image plane.

When the image plane is parallel to two world-coordinate axes, lines parallel to the axis that is cut by this image plane will have images that meet at a single vanishing point. Lines parallel to the other two axes will not form vanishing points as they are parallel to the image plane. This is one-point perspective. Similarly, when the image plane intersects two world-coordinate axes, lines parallel to those planes will meet form two vanishing points in the picture plane. This is called two-point perspective. In three-point perspective the image plane intersects the , , and axes and therefore lines parallel to these axes intersect, resulting in three different vanishing points.

==Theorem==
The vanishing point theorem is the principal theorem in the science of perspective. It says that the image in a picture plane of a line in space, not parallel to the picture, is determined by its intersection with and its vanishing point. Some authors have used the phrase, &quot;the image of a line includes its vanishing point&quot;. Guidobaldo del Monte gave several verifications, and Humphry Ditton called the result the &quot;main and Great Proposition&quot;. Brook Taylor wrote the first book in English on perspective in 1714, which introduced the term &quot;vanishing point&quot; and was the first to fully explain the geometry of multipoint perspective, and historian Kirsti Andersen compiled these observations. She notes, in terms of projective geometry, the vanishing point is the image of the point at infinity associated with , as the sightline from through the vanishing point is parallel to .

==Vanishing line==
As a vanishing point originates in a line, so a vanishing line originates in a plane that is not parallel to the picture . Given the eye point , and the plane parallel to and lying on , then the vanishing line of is . For example, when is the ground plane and is the horizon plane, then the vanishing line of is the horizon line .

To put it simply, the vanishing line of some plane, say , is obtained by the intersection of the image plane with another plane, say , parallel to the plane of interest (), passing through the camera center. For different sets of lines parallel to this plane , their respective vanishing points will lie on this vanishing line. The horizon line is a theoretical line that represents the eye level of the observer. If the object is below the horizon line, its lines angle up to the horizon line. If the object is above, they slope down.

==Properties==
1. Projections of two sets of parallel lines lying in some plane appear to converge, i.e. the vanishing point associated with that pair, on a horizon line, or vanishing line formed by the intersection of the image plane with the plane parallel to and passing through the pinhole. 
Proof: Consider the ground plane , as which is, for the sake of simplicity, orthogonal to the image plane. Also, consider a line that lies in the plane , which is defined by the equation .
Using perspective pinhole projections, a point on projected on the image plane will have coordinates defined as,
:
This is the parametric representation of the image of the line with as the parameter. When it stops at the point on the axis of the image plane. This is the vanishing point corresponding to all parallel lines with slope in the plane . All vanishing points associated with different lines with different slopes belonging to plane will lie on the axis, which in this case is the horizon line.

2. Let , , and be three mutually orthogonal straight lines in space and , , be the three corresponding vanishing points respectively. If we know the coordinates of one of these points, say , and the direction of a straight line on the image plane, which passes through a second point, say , we can compute the coordinates of both and 

3. Let , , and be three mutually orthogonal straight lines in space and , , be the three corresponding vanishing points respectively. The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices in the three vanishing points is the intersection of the optical axis and the image plane.

==Curvilinear and reverse perspective==
A curvilinear perspective is a drawing with either 4 or 5 vanishing points. In 5-point perspective the vanishing points are mapped into a circle with 4 vanishing points at the cardinal headings N, W, S, E and one at the circle&#x27;s origin.

A reverse perspective is a drawing with vanishing points that are placed outside the painting with the illusion that they are &quot;in front of&quot; the painting.

==Detection==

Several methods for vanishing point detection make use of the line segments detected in images. Other techniques involve considering the intensity gradients of the image pixels directly.

There are significantly large numbers of vanishing points present in an image. Therefore, the aim is to detect the vanishing points that correspond to the principal directions of a scene. This is generally achieved in two steps. The first step, called the accumulation step, as the name suggests, clusters the line segments with the assumption that a cluster will have a common vanishing point. The next step finds the principal clusters present in the scene and therefore it is called the search step.

In the accumulation step, the image is mapped onto a bounded space called the accumulator space. The accumulator space is partitioned into units called cells. Barnard assumed this space to be a Gaussian sphere centered on the optical center of the camera as an accumulator space. A line segment on the image corresponds to a great circle on this sphere, and the vanishing point in the image is mapped to a point. The Gaussian sphere has accumulator cells that increase when a great circle passes through them, i.e. in the image a line segment intersects the vanishing point. Several modifications have been made since, but one of the most efficient techniques was using the Hough Transform, mapping the parameters of the line segment to the bounded space. Cascaded Hough Transforms have been applied for multiple vanishing points.

The process of mapping from the image to the bounded spaces causes the loss of the actual distances between line segments and points.

In the search step, the accumulator cell with the maximum number of line segments passing through it is found. This is followed by removal of those line segments, and the search step is repeated until this count goes below a certain threshold. As more computing power is now available, points corresponding to two or three mutually orthogonal directions can be found.

==Applications==

# Camera calibration: The vanishing points of an image contain important information for camera calibration. Various calibration techniques have been introduced using the properties of vanishing points to find intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters.
# 3D reconstruction: A man-made environment has two main characteristics – several lines in the scene are parallel, and a number of edges present are orthogonal. Vanishing points aid in comprehending the environment. Using sets of parallel lines in the plane, the orientation of the plane can be calculated using vanishing points. Torre and Coelho performed extensive investigation in the use of vanishing points to implement a full system. With the assumption that the environment consists of objects with only parallel or perpendicular sides, also called Lego-land, using vanishing points constructed in a single image of the scene they recovered the 3D geometry of the scene. Similar ideas are also used in the field of robotics, mainly in navigation and autonomous vehicles, and in areas concerned with object detection.

<doc id="538123" wikidata="Q2424449" url="?curid=538123" title="Ticker tape">
<text>Ticker tape was the earliest electrical dedicated financial communications medium, transmitting stock price information over telegraph lines, in use from around 1870 to 1970. It consisted of a paper strip that ran through a machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company names as alphabetic symbols followed by numeric stock transaction price and volume information. The term &quot;ticker&quot; came from the sound made by the machine as it printed.

The ticker tape revolutionized financial markets, as it relayed information from trading floors continuously and simultaneously across geographical distances. Paper ticker tape became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers were increasingly used to transmit financial information. The concept of the stock ticker lives on, however, in the scrolling electronic tickers seen on brokerage walls and on news and financial television channels.

Ticker tape stock price telegraphs were invented in 1867 by Edward A. Calahan, an employee of the American Telegraph Company who later founded The ADT Corporation.

==History==
Although telegraphic printing systems were invented by Royal Earl House in 1846, early models were fragile, required hand-cranked power, frequently went out of synchronization between sender and receiver, and did not become popular in widespread commercial use. David E. Hughes improved the printing telegraph design with clockwork weight power in 1856, and his design was further improved and became viable for commercial use when George M. Phelps devised a resynchronization system in 1858. The first stock price ticker system using a telegraphic printer was invented by Edward A. Calahan in 1863; he unveiled his device in New York City on November 15, 1867. Early versions of stock tickers provided the first mechanical means of conveying stock prices (&quot;quotes&quot;), over a long distance via telegraph wiring. In its infancy, the ticker used the same symbols as Morse code as a medium for conveying messages. One of the earliest practical stock ticker machines, the Universal Stock Ticker developed by Thomas Edison in 1869, used alphanumeric characters with a printing speed of approximately one character per second.

Previously, stock prices had been hand-delivered via written or verbal messages. Since the useful time-span of individual quotes is very brief, they generally had not been sent long distances; aggregated summaries, typically for one day, were sent instead. The increase in speed provided by the ticker allowed for faster and more exact sales. Since the ticker ran continuously, updates to a stock&#x27;s price whenever the price changed became effective much faster and trading became a more time-sensitive matter. For the first time, trades were being done in what is now thought of as near real-time.

By the 1880s, there were about a thousand stock tickers installed in the offices of New York bankers and brokers. In 1890, members of the exchange agreed to create the New York Quotation Co., buying up all other ticker companies to ensure accuracy of reporting of price and volume activity.

==Technology==
Stock ticker machines are an ancestor of the modern computer printer, being one of the first applications of transmitting text over a wire to a printing device, based on the printing telegraph. This used the technology of the then-recently invented telegraph machines, with the advantage that the output was readable text, instead of the dots and dashes of Morse code. A special typewriter designed for operation over telegraph wires was used at the opposite end of the telegraph wire connection to the ticker machine. Text typed on the typewriter was displayed on the ticker machine at the opposite end of the connection.

The machines printed a series of &quot;ticker symbols&quot; (usually shortened forms of a company&#x27;s name), followed by brief information about the price of that company&#x27;s stock; the thin strip of paper on which they were printed was called &quot;ticker tape&quot;. The word &quot;ticker&quot; comes from the distinct tapping (or &quot;ticking&quot;) noise the machines made while printing. Pulses on the telegraph line made a letter wheel turn step by step until the correct symbol was reached and then printed. A typical 32-symbol letter wheel had to turn on average 15 steps until the next letter could be printed resulting in a very slow printing speed of one character per second. In 1883, ticker transmitter keyboards resembled the keyboard of a piano with black keys indicating letters and the white keys indicating numbers and fractions, corresponding to two rotating type wheels in the connected ticker tape printers.

Newer and more efficient tickers became available in the 1930s, but these newer and better tickers still had an approximate 15- to 20-minute delay. Ticker machines became obsolete in the 1960s, replaced by computer networks; none have been manufactured for use for decades. However, working reproductions of at least one model are now being manufactured for museums and collectors.

Simulated ticker displays, named after the original machines, still exist as part of the display of television news channels and on some websites—see news ticker. One of the most famous outdoor displays is the simulated ticker scrolling marquee called &quot;The Zipper&quot; located at One Times Square in New York City.

Ticker tapes then and now contain generally the same information. The ticker symbol is a unique set of characters used to identify the company. The shares traded is the volume for the trade being quoted. Price traded refers to the price per share of a particular trade. Change direction is a visual cue showing whether the stock is trading higher or lower than the previous trade, hence the terms &quot;downtick&quot; and &quot;uptick&quot;. Change amount refers to the difference in price from the previous day&#x27;s closing. Many today include color to indicate whether a stock is trading higher than the previous day&#x27;s (green), lower than previous (red), or has remained unchanged (blue or white).

==Other uses==
===Baseball===
In the early days of baseball, before electronic scoreboards, manual score turners used a ticker to get the latest scores from around the league. Today, computers and electronic scoreboards have replaced the manual scoreboard and the ticker.

===Parades===
Used ticker tape was often repurposed as confetti, to be thrown from the windows above parades either cut up into scraps or thrown as whole spools, primarily in lower Manhattan; this became known as a ticker tape parade. Ticker tape parades generally celebrated some significant event, such as the end of World War I and World War II, or the safe return of one of the early astronauts.

Ticker tape parades are still held in New York City, specifically in the &quot;Canyon of Heroes&quot; in Manhattan, most often when local sports teams win a championship. However, actual ticker tape is not used any longer during these parades; often, pieces of paper from paper shredders are used as a convenient source of confetti.

===Art===
Ticker tape was also incorporated into some of the weaver Dorothy Liebes&#x27; unusual art textiles.

<text>Lorenzo&#x27;s oil is a liquid solution made of 4 parts glycerol trioleate and 1 part glycerol trierucate, which are the triacylglycerol forms of oleic acid and erucic acid. It is prepared from olive oil and rapeseed oil.
It is used in the investigational treatment of asymptomatic patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a nervous system disorder.

Development of the oil was led by Augusto and Michaela Odone after their son Lorenzo was diagnosed with the disease in 1984, at the age of five. Lorenzo was predicted to die within a few years. His parents sought experimental treatment options, and the initial formulation of the oil was developed by retired British scientist Don Suddaby (formerly of Croda International). Suddaby and his colleague, Keith Coupland, received a U.S. patent (since expired) for invention of the oil. The royalties received by Augusto were paid to The Myelin Project which he and Michaela founded to further research treatments for ALD and similar disorders. The Odones and their invention obtained widespread publicity in 1992 because of the film &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot;.

Research on the effectiveness of Lorenzo&#x27;s oil has seen mixed results, with possible benefit for asymptomatic ALD patients but of unpredictable or no benefit to those with symptoms, suggesting its possible role as a preventative measure in families identified as ALD dominant. Lorenzo Odone died on May 30, 2008, at the age of 30; he was bedridden with paralysis and died from aspiration pneumonia, likely caused by having inhaled food.

==Treatment cost==
In 2012, Lorenzo&#x27;s oil cost approximately $400 USD for a month&#x27;s treatment.

==Proposed mechanism of action==
The mixture of fatty acids purportedly reduces the levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which are elevated in ALD. It does so by competitively inhibiting the enzyme that forms VLCFAs.

==Effectiveness==

Lorenzo&#x27;s oil, in combination with a diet low in VLCFA, has been investigated for its possible effects on the progression of ALD. Clinical results have been mixed and the use of Lorenzo&#x27;s oil has been controversial due to uncertainties regarding its clinical efficacy and the clinical indications for its use.

Hugo Moser played a prominent role in both the treatment of Lorenzo Odone and the scientific evaluation of Lorenzo&#x27;s oil. In 2005, Moser published a controlled study concluding that Lorenzo&#x27;s oil does not alter the course of the illness in symptomatic patients, but asymptomatic patients had a reduced risk of developing ALD while on the dietary therapy. Moser appraised Lorenzo&#x27;s oil again in a 2007 report.

Moser&#x27;s findings, that Lorenzo&#x27;s oil did not help symptomatic ALD patients, are consistent with prior studies published in 2003 and 1999.

A study by Poulos published in 1994 found that Lorenzo&#x27;s oil is of limited value in correcting the accumulation of saturated VLCFAs in the brain of patients with ALD. Comparative autopsies showed that treatment enriched erucic acid in plasma and tissues, but not in the brain.

==Side effects==
The oil has been shown to cause a lowered platelet count, which can lead to thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia.

There are no reports of toxicity from dietary consumption of erucic acid.

==Current state==
Dietary manipulation using Lorenzo&#x27;s oil has been shown to lower blood levels of very long chain fatty acids, but it is ineffective in symptomatic ALD. Moser&#x27;s 2005 study has found &quot;strongly suggestive, albeit not fully definitive, evidence of a preventive effect&quot; of Lorenzo&#x27;s oil on the onset of symptoms when used by asymptomatic patients.

<doc id="538132" wikidata="Q2634498" url="?curid=538132" title="Octagonal number">
<text>In mathematics, an octagonal number is a figurate number. The &quot;n&quot;th octagonal number &quot;o&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the number of dots in a pattern of dots consisting of the outlines of regular octagons with sides up to &quot;n&quot; dots, when the octagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex. The octagonal number for &quot;n&quot; is given by the formula 3&quot;n&quot;2 − 2&quot;n&quot;, with &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0. The first few octagonal numbers are

: 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, 96, 133, 176, 225, 280, 341, 408, 481, 560, 645, 736, 833, 936 

The octagonal number for &quot;n&quot; can also be calculated by adding the square of &quot;n&quot; to twice the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)th pronic number.

Octagonal numbers consistently alternate parity.

Octagonal numbers are occasionally referred to as &quot;star numbers&quot;, though that term is more commonly used to refer to centered dodecagonal numbers.

==Applications in combinatorics==
The formula_1th octagonal number is the number of partitions of formula_2 into 1, 2, or 3s. For example, there are formula_3 such partitions for formula_4, namely
: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1,2], [1,1,1,1,3], [1,1,1,2,2], [1,1,2,3], [1,2,2,2], [1,3,3] and [2,2,3].

==Sum of reciprocals==
A formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the octagonal numbers is given by
formula_5

==Test for octagonal numbers==

Solving the formula for the &quot;n&quot;-th octagonal number, formula_6 for &quot;n&quot; gives
formula_7
An arbitrary number &quot;x&quot; can be checked for octagonality by putting it in this equation. If &quot;n&quot; is an integer, then &quot;x&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;-th octagonal number. If &quot;n&quot; is not an integer, then &quot;x&quot; is not octagonal.

<text>Vytas Brenner (19 September 1946 – 18 March 2004) was a German-born Venezuelan musician, keyboardist, guitarist and composer.

==Biography==
Vytas Brenner was born in Tübingen, Germany, but his family migrated to Venezuela in 1949, when he was 2 years old. His mother, Margarita Brenner, was an opera singer.

Brenner began his musical studies in Caracas at &quot;Colegio Emil Friedman&quot; school, a prestigious institution heavily oriented toward musical education. When he was 12 years old, he moved to Italy and then to Spain, where he founded the group &quot;Brenner&#x27;s Folk&quot;, the precursor of the successful band Pic-Nic. When he was 21 years old, Vytas moved to Tennessee to study at the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Music Conservatory, where he was a pupil of David Van Vactor. Later, at college in Nashville, Vytas took post-graduate courses in Electronic music with Professor Gilbert Trythall, and graduated with honors in 1972. In 1971, he started a duo named &quot;Vytas &amp; Mafe&quot; with Venezuelan singer María Fernanda Márquez.

In 1972, Brenner formed his own band, &quot;La Ofrenda&quot; (The Offering) and recorded five successful albums until 1979. With &quot;Ofrenda&quot; he started his pioneer work with compositions for combinations of electric and electronic instruments (synthesizers) with acoustic instruments and piano; and blending progressive-symphonic rock, Latin rhythms, and Venezuelan traditional themes, with astounding results. 
Brenner recorded several remarkable albums, each one a breakthrough, as he was in fact developing a new genre in giant leaps. In 1982, a somewhat reunited &quot;Ofrenda&quot; performed at the &quot;Teatro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo&quot;, but was coldly received by the public, followed by strong press criticism. In 1989, the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra performed his work &quot;Oro Negro&quot; (&quot;Black Gold&quot;) at the Caracas&#x27; famed Teatro Teresa Carreño. In 1989, he released the album entitled &quot;Amazonia&quot;. He was commissioned to compose works for &quot;Viajando con Polar&quot;, a series of short documentaries about Venezuela&#x27;s regions, depicting their beautiful landscapes and rich folklore. He created music for various films, such as &quot;Adiós Alicia&quot;, &quot;Se llamaba SN&quot;, and playwright Román Chalbaud&#x27;s &quot;Carmen la que contaba 16 años&quot;. All the while, Brenner was a very successful studio musician, composing and performing in countless radio jingles, television commercials and presidential campaigns. At the international level, his old and rare vinyl records sell for between US$70 to US$220.

Brenner died on 18 March 2004 of a heart attack in Salzburg, Austria, at the age of 57, while recording music for an upcoming album.

<text>Soroca is a city and municipality in northern Moldova, situated on the Dniester River about north of Chișinău. It is the administrative center of the Soroca District.

==History==

It is known for its well-preserved stronghold, established by the Moldavian prince Stephen the Great (&quot;Ștefan cel Mare&quot; in Romanian) in 1499. The origins of the name Soroca are not fully known. Soroca (сорока) is the East Slavic word for magpie. Its location is only a few kilometers from the Moldova–Ukrainian border.

The original wooden fort, which defended a ford over the Dniester, was an important link in the chain of fortifications which comprised four forts (e.g., Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, then known as Akkerman, and Khotyn) on the Dniester, two forts on the Danube, and three forts on the north borders of medieval Moldavia. Between 1543 and 1546, under the rule of Peter IV Rareș, the fort was rebuilt in stone as a perfect circle with five bastions situated at equal distances.

During the Great Turkish War, John III Sobieski&#x27;s forces successfully defended the fort against the Ottomans. It was of vital military importance during the Pruth River Campaign of Peter the Great in 1711. The stronghold was sacked by the Russians in the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39). The Soroca Fort is an important attraction in Soroca, having preserved cultures and kept the old Soroca to the present day.

The locality was greatly extended in the 19th century, during a period of relative prosperity. Soroca became a regional center featuring large squares, modernized streets, hospitals, grammar schools and conventionalized churches. During the Soviet period, the city became an important industrial center for northern Moldova.

Soroca was known for producing grapes, wheat, maize, and tobacco in 1919.

The town&#x27;s sizeable Jewish populated was murdered in the Holocaust during World War II.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Soroca amounted to 22,196 inhabitants (making it the eight largest city in Moldova), a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 28,362 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 10,575 were men and 11,621 were women.


&quot;Footnotes&quot;:

* &quot;There is an ongoing controversy regarding the ethnic identification of Moldovans and Romanians.&quot;

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

The population was estimated at 35,000 in 1919. It consisted mainly of Jews. Romanians, Germans, and Russians also lived in the city. Before the Holocaust, the city had a Jewish population of around 18,000, but there are only 100 today and 20 of them are considered Jewish according to the &quot;halakha&quot;.

The city has a sizable Romani minority and is popularly known as the &quot;Romani capital of Moldova&quot;.

The climate in Soroca is a warm-summer subtype (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) of the humid continental climate.

<doc id="538146" wikidata="Q332793" url="?curid=538146" title="Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge">
<text>Field Marshal Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge, (30 March 1785 – 24 September 1856) was a British Army officer and politician. After serving in the Peninsular War and the Waterloo Campaign he became Secretary at War in Wellington&#x27;s ministry. After a tour as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1830 he became Secretary at War again in Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s cabinet. He went on to be Governor-General of India at the time of the First Anglo-Sikh War and then Commander-in-Chief of the Forces during the Crimean War.

==Early life==
The son of the Rev, Henry Hardinge, Rector of Stanhope, and his wife Frances Best, he was educated at Durham School and Sevenoaks School. Hardinge entered the British Army on 23 July 1799 as an ensign in the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, a corps then stationed in Upper Canada. He was promoted to lieutenant by purchase in the 4th Regiment of Foot on 27 March 1802 and transferred to the 1st Regiment of Foot on 11 July 1803 before becoming a captain of a company by purchase in the 57th Regiment of Foot on 21 April 1804. In February 1806 he was sent to the newly formed Staff College at High Wycombe.

== Military career ==
=== Peninsular War ===

He saw action at the Battle of Roliça on 17 August 1808, at the Battle of Vimeiro on 21 August 1808, where he was wounded, and at Corunna on 16 January 1809 where he was by the side of Sir John Moore when the latter was killed. He was promoted to major on 13 April 1809 and appointed deputy-quartermaster-general in the Portuguese army and was present at many of the battles of the Peninsular War. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1811, he saved the day for the British at Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811 by taking responsibility at a critical moment and strongly urging General Cole&#x27;s division to advance. He took part in the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813, where he was wounded again, and was also present at the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813 and the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November 1813. He commanded the Portuguese brigade at the Battle of Orthez on 27 February 1814 and the Battle of Toulouse on 10 April 1814. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in January 1815.

=== Hundred Days campaign ===
When war broke out again in 1815 after Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba, Hardinge returned to active service as a brigadier. Attached to the staff of the allied Prussian Army under Marshal Blucher, he was present at the Battle of Ligny on 16 June 1815, where he lost his left hand by a shot, and thus was not present at Waterloo two days later. Wellington presented him with a sword that had belonged to Napoleon. Hardinge remained attached to the Prussian army of occupation in France until 1818.

He was promoted to brevet colonel on 19 July 1821 and to major-general on 22 July 1830.

==Political service==
=== Member of Parliament ===

At the 1820 general election, Hardinge was returned to parliament as member for Durham. On 4 April 1823 he was appointed Clerk of the Ordnance a post he held until May 1827, and then again from January to May 1828. On 9 June 1828 he accepted the office of Secretary at War in Wellington&#x27;s ministry, and was appointed a privy councillor. On 21 March 1829 he acted as the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s second for the Wellington–Winchilsea duel at Battersea Fields. At the 1830 general election he transferred to the pocket borough of St Germans.

In July 1830 he exchanged portfolios with Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, becoming Chief Secretary for Ireland, but relinquished the post in November following the collapse of the Wellington–Peel ministry. He resigned his seat at St Germans in December and was elected for Newport, another Tory pocket borough, a week later. He held Newport at the 1831 general election and in 1832, after Newport was disenfranchised, stood in Launceston and was re-elected. He would remain in this seat until he stood down in May 1844.

=== Chief Secretary for Ireland ===
He was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland from December 1834 to April 1835, and then was Secretary at War once again in Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s cabinet from 1841 to 1844. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1841. At this time he had a London home at Whitehall Gardens, Westminster.

=== Governor-General of India ===
In May 1844 he succeeded Lord Ellenborough as Governor-General of India. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 1 July 1844. Following the death of Maharajah Ranjit Singh tribal war broke out and the first Sikh War ensued in 1845. Hardinge, waiving his right to the supreme command, offered to serve as second in command under Sir Hugh Gough. At the Battle of Mudki on 18 December 1845 Gough commanded the right flank and Hardinge commanded the left flank. After further British successes at the Battle of Sobraon on 10 February 1846, the Battle of Ferozeshah on 21 December 1845 and the Battle of Aliwal on 28 January 1846, Hardinge concluded the campaign with the Treaty of Lahore with Maharajah Duleep Singh on 9 March 1846 and the Treaty of Amritsar with Maharajah Gulab Singh on 16 March 1846. He was created Viscount Hardinge of Lahore and of King&#x27;s Newton in Derbyshire on 7 April 1846.

Recognising an annuity of £5,000 being paid by the East India Company, Parliament provided that Viscount Hardinge should continue to receive his full salary as Governor General. Under a subsequent Act, in recognition of his &quot;great and brilliant services&quot;, Parliament settled an annuity of £3,000 on Lord Hardinge and the next two heirs male of his body, although this was not to be paid if the East India Company paid an annuity.

==Commander-in-Chief==

Hardinge returned to England in 1848, and became Master-General of the Ordnance on 5 March 1852; he succeeded the Duke of Wellington as commander-in-chief of the British Army on 28 September 1852. While in this position he had responsibility for the direction of the Crimean War, which he endeavoured to conduct on Wellington&#x27;s principles — a system not altogether suited to the changed mode of warfare. He was promoted to brevet general on 20 June 1854 and field marshal on 2 October 1855. A commission was set up to investigate the failings of the British military during the Crimean campaign. As Hardinge was delivering the report of the commission to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he collapsed with a stroke. Albert helped him to a sofa, where despite being paralysed on one side, he continued to deliver his report, apologizing for the interruption.

He was also colonel of the 97th Regiment of Foot from 4 March 1833 and of the 57th Regiment of Foot from 31 May 1843.

Hardinge resigned his office of commander-in-chief in July 1856, owing to failing health, and died on 24 September 1856 at South Park near Tunbridge Wells. There is a memorial to him at St John the Baptist, Penshurst. He is buried in the churchyard at St. Peter, Fordcombe.

==Family==
In 1821 he married Lady Emily Jane, seventh daughter of Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry. They had two sons, and two daughters:

*Charles Stewart Hardinge, 2nd Viscount Hardinge of Lahore and Kings Newton (2 Sep 1822 – 28 July 1894)
*Arthur Edward Hardinge (2 Mar 1828 – 15 July 1892) married Mary Georgina Frances Ellis, daughter of Lt.-Col. Hon. Augustus Frederick Ellis. They had two sons, and three daughters, one of whom being Arthur Henry Hardinge.
*Hon. Frances Elizabeth Hardinge (d. 9 July 1894) married Gen. Sir Arthur Cunynghame, son of Sir David Cunynghame, 5th Baronet. They had two sons, and three daughters.
*Hon. Emily Caroline Hardinge (d. 4 Sep 1876). Unmarried, a lady-in-waiting to Princess Alice of the United Kingdom.

His elder son, Charles Stewart, who had been his private secretary in India, was the 2nd Viscount Hardinge. The younger son of the 2nd Viscount, Charles Hardinge (b. 1858), became a prominent diplomat, and was appointed Viceroy of India in 1910, being created Baron Hardinge of Penshurst.

His stepson was Walter James, 1st Baron Northbourne, (1816–1893).

<text>Open communion is the practice of some Protestant Churches of allowing members and non-members to receive the Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Lord&#x27;s Supper). Many but not all churches that practice open communion require that the person receiving communion be a baptized Christian, and other requirements may apply as well. In Methodism, open communion is referred to as the open table, meaning that all may approach the Communion table.

Open communion is the opposite of closed communion, where the sacrament is reserved for members of the particular church or others with which it is in a relationship of full communion or fellowship, or has otherwise recognized for that purpose. Closed communion may refer to either a particular denomination or an individual congregation serving Communion only to its own members.

== Affirmation ==
Generally, churches that offer open communion to other Christians do not require an explicit affirmation of Christianity from the communicant before distributing the elements; the act of receiving is an implicit affirmation. Some churches make an announcement before communion begins such as &quot;We invite all who have professed a faith in Christ to join us at the table.&quot;

Open communion is generally practiced in churches where the elements are passed through the congregation (also called self-communication). However, it is also practiced in some churches that have a communion procession, where the congregation comes forward to receive communion in front of the altar; such is the case in the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, most Anglican churches, and some Lutheran churches.

== Supporting belief ==
Those practising open communion generally believe that the invitation to receive communion is an invitation to Christ&#x27;s table, and that it is not the province of human beings to interfere between an individual and Christ. Some traditions maintain that there are certain circumstances under which individuals should not present themselves for (and should voluntarily refrain from receiving) communion. However, if those individuals were to present themselves for communion, they would not be denied. In other traditions, the concept of being &quot;unfit to receive&quot; is unknown, and the actual refusal to distribute the elements to an individual would be considered scandalous.

== Practitioners ==
Most Protestant churches practise open communion, although many require that the communicant be a baptized Christian. Open communion subject to baptism is an official policy of the Church of England and churches in the Anglican Communion. Other churches allowing open communion (with or without the baptism requirement) include the Church of the Nazarene, the Evangelical Free Church, the Church of God, Community Churches, the Presbyterian Church (USA), , the Presbyterian Church in America, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Canada, United Church of Christ, United Methodist Church, the Free Methodist Church, Global Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, Foursquare Gospel Church, Association of Vineyard Churches, Metropolitan Community Church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Churches of Christ, Assemblies of God, the Reformed Church in America, Seventh-day Adventists, Free Will Baptists, Seventh Day Baptists, and most churches in the Southern Baptist Convention. All bodies in the Liberal Catholic Movement practise open communion as a matter of policy. The official policy of the Episcopal Church is to only invite baptized persons to receive communion. However, many parishes do not insist on this and practise open communion. Among Gnostic churches, both the Ecclesia Gnostica and the Apostolic Johannite Church practise open communion. The Plymouth Brethren were founded on the basis of an open communion with any baptized Christian: today, following John Nelson Darby, Exclusive Brethren practise closed communion, and Open Brethren practise open communion on the basis of &quot;receiving to the Lord&#x27;s table those whom He has received, time being allowed for confidence to be established in our minds that those who we receive are the Lord&#x27;s.&quot;

Most churches in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America practise their own form of open communion, offering the Eucharist to adults without receiving catechetical instruction, provided they are baptized and believe in the Real Presence. The Christian churches and the Calvary Chapel as well as other nondenominational churches also practise open communion. The Uniting Church in Australia practises open communion, inviting all attending to participate.

The Churches of Denmark, Norway and Sweden are open communion churches.

Notable exceptions include the Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, Reformed Seventh Day Adventists, traditional Lutheran churches, and some Reformed Protestant or Calvinist denominations (in which you must be a baptized member). All these typically practise some form of closed communion.

Churches of Christ, though holding to a closed communion view, in practice do not prohibit visitors from taking communion, on the view that per 1 Corinthians 11:28 the visitor must &quot;examine himself&quot; and decide to partake or decline (i.e. it is not for the minister, elders/deacons, or members to decide who may or may not partake); thus, the practice is more akin to open communion.

Assemblies of God, Baptist and other churches that practise congregational polity, due to their autonomous nature, may (depending on the individual congregation) practise open or closed communion.

Other groups that practise open communion are the Moravian Church Wesleyans, and the Christian and Missionary Alliance.

Within the Latter Day Saint movement, the Community of Christ practices open communion. The LDS Church, on the other hand, views its corresponding ceremony (known as the Sacrament) as having meaning only for church members (though without actually forbidding others from participating).

Some Independent Catholic Churches, such as the American Catholic Church in the United States, American National Catholic Church, and Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church practice open communion, sometimes even allowing non-baptized and non-Christians receive commission.

In the Anglican Communion, as well as in many other traditional Christian denominations, those who are not baptized may come forward in the communion line with their arms crossed over their chest, in order to receive a blessing from the priest, in lieu of Holy Communion. This practice is also used in the Roman Catholic church at funeral masses, where attendees frequently include non-Catholics.

Within the Nontrinitarian groups, the Church of God General Conference practices open communion, as well as many Unitarian and Universalist Christian churches such as Kings Chapel in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Position of the Catholic Church ==
The Catholic Church does not practise or recognise open communion. In general it permits access to its Eucharistic communion only to baptized Catholics. Catholics can only receive Holy Communion if they are in a state of grace, this is without any mortal sin: &quot;A person who is conscious of grave sin (mortal sin) is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible.&quot;

In lieu of Holy Communion, some parishes invite non-Catholics to come forward in the line, with their arms crossed over their chest, and receive a blessing from the priest. However, Canon 844 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law of the Latin Church and the parallel canon 671 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches also recognizes that in certain circumstances, by way of exception, and under certain conditions, access to these sacraments may be permitted, or even commended, for Christians of other Churches and ecclesial Communities.

Thus it permits Eastern Christians who are not in full communion with the Catholic Church (Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and Assyrian Church of the East) to receive Communion from Catholic ministers, if they request it of their own accord and are properly disposed, and it applies the same rule also to some Western Churches that the Holy See judges to be in a situation similar to that of Eastern Christians with regard to the sacraments. 

On 15 November 2015, while at Christuskirche in Rome Pope Francis answered a Lutheran woman wishing to be able to participate in Holy Communion with her Catholic husband: &quot;It is a question that each person must answer for themselves … there is one baptism, one faith, one Lord, so talk to the Lord and move forward&quot;. In the following year at Lund Cathedral, in a joint Lutheran-Catholic service commemorating the Reformation, Pope Francis and Bishop Munib Younan (the head of the Lutheran World Federation) &quot;jointly pledged to remove the obstacles to full unity between their Churches, leading eventually to shared Eucharist.&quot; 

Recognizing that &quot;that everyone in a marriage that binds denominations,&quot; the Catholic Church in Germany in 2018 produced a pastoral handout allowing Lutheran spouses of Catholics to receive Communion from Catholic ministers in certain cases, &#x27;provided they &quot;affirm the Catholic faith in the Eucharist&quot;.&#x27; Thus far, Archbishop Hans-Josef Becker (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn), Archbishop Stefan Heße (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg), Archbishop Ludwig Schick (Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda), and Bishop Franz Jung (Roman Catholic Diocese of Würzburg) have implemented the pastoral document, in addition to Bishops Gerhard Feige of Magdeburg and Franz-Josef Bode of Osnabrück declaring their intention to implement the pastoral document well. Bishop Franz Jung, while celebrating a Jubilee Mass on 5 July 2018 at Würzburg Cathedral, called inter-denominational marriages &quot;denomination-uniting&quot; and thus &quot;especially invited&quot; couples in which one spouse is Protestant to receive the Eucharist during his sermon.

For other baptized Christians (such as Anglicans, Methodists and other Protestants) under the jurisdiction of other episcopal conferences, the conditions are more severe. Only in danger of death or if, in the judgment of the local bishop, there is a grave and pressing need, may members of these Churches who cannot approach a minister of their own Church be invited to receive the Eucharist, if they spontaneously ask for it, demonstrate that they have the catholic faith in the Eucharist, and are properly disposed.

Catholic priests have sometimes not observed these rules, giving Holy Communion to non-Catholics sometimes unknowingly. Notably, Pope John Paul II gave Holy Communion to Brother Roger, a Reformed pastor and founder of the Taizé Community, several times; in addition Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) also gave Brother Roger the Eucharist. Moreover, after Brother Roger&#x27;s death, at the Mass celebrated for him in France, &quot;communion wafers were given to the faithful indiscriminately, regardless of denomination&quot;.

The Catholic Church does not allow its own faithful to receive Communion from non-catholic ministers in whose Churches these sacraments are valid, apart from in extreme cases, such as danger of death, and only if it recognizes the validity of the sacraments of that Church. Other conditions are that it be physically or morally impossible for the Catholic to approach a Catholic minister, that it be a case of real need or spiritual benefit, and that the danger of error or indifferentism be avoided.

== Position of the Lutheran Church ==
The Lutheran Church has a variety of practices, depending on denominational polity. Some branches of Lutheranism, such as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, do not practice open communion; they exclude non-members and require catechetical instructions for all people before receiving the Eucharist. This generally stems from an understanding that sharing communion is a sign of Christian unity; where that unity is not present, neither should Eucharistic sharing be present. Some Lutheran church bodies use the term &quot;altar and pulpit fellowship&quot; to refer to their specific practices.

Other parts of the Lutheran Church, including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and many members of the Lutheran World Federation, practice open communion and welcome all Baptized Christians to commune while ensuring that Lutheran belief on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist is declared orally or in writing. Guests are then left to decide whether they should or should not receive the Eucharist. The ELCA has specific communion sharing agreements with a number of other Christian denominations, encouraging the sharing of the sacrament across belief system boundaries. The understanding that lies behind this practice is that Communion is both a foretaste of eschatological Christian unity as well as an effective means of fostering that unity.

The Evangelical Church in Germany, which is a federation of Lutheran and Reformed churches, has an open communion.

<doc id="538150" wikidata="Q1450765" url="?curid=538150" title="French Territory of the Afars and the Issas">
<text>The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas (FTAI; ) was the name given to present-day Djibouti between 1967 and 1977, while it was still an overseas territory of France. The area was formerly known as French Somaliland (&quot;&quot;). Its name derives from the Afar people of Djibouti and the Somali Issa clan.

==History==
From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura was called &quot;Obock&quot; and ruled by Somali and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to gain a foothold in the region. In 1894, Léonce Lagarde established a permanent French administration in the city of Djibouti and named the region &quot;Côte française des Somalis&quot; (French Somaliland), a name which continued until 1967.

In 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia&#x27;s independence in 1960, a referendum was held in the territory to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There were also allegations of widespread vote rigging. The majority of those who had voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. In October 1960, he and several of his associates died in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances on a return trip from China to Somalia.

In 1966, France rejected the United Nations recommendation that it should grant French Somaliland independence. In August of the same year, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General Charles de Gaulle, was also met with demonstrations and rioting. In response to the protests, de Gaulle ordered another referendum.

On 19 March 1967, a second plebiscite was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. Voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual reunion with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France. However, the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities, with some 10,000 Somalis deported under the pretext that they did not have valid identity cards. According to the UN, there was an inordinate number of invalid ballots in Somali districts, which it suggested implied that the plebiscite had been manipulated. Although the territory was at the time inhabited by 58,240 Somali and 48,270 Afar, official figures indicated that only 14,689 Somali were allowed to register to vote versus 22,004 Afar. Somali representatives also charged that the French had simultaneously imported thousands of Afar nomads from neighboring Ethiopia to further tip the odds in their favor, but the French authorities denied this, suggesting that Afars already greatly outnumbered Somalis on the voting lists. Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths. France also increased its military force along the frontier.

In 1967, shortly after the referendum was held, French Somaliland was renamed Territoire français des Afars et des Issas. This was both in acknowledgement of the large Afar constituency and to downplay the significance of the Somali composition (the Issa being a Somali subclan).
The French Territory of Afars and Issas also differed from French Somaliland in terms of government structure, as the position of Governor General changed to that of High Commissioner. A nine-member council of government was also implemented.

With a steadily enlarging Somali population, the likelihood of a third referendum appearing successful for the French had grown even dimmer. The prohibitive cost of maintaining the colony, France&#x27;s last outpost on the continent, was another factor that compelled observers to doubt that the French would attempt to hold on to the territory.

On 8 May 1977, a third vote took place. A landslide 99.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from France, officially marking Djibouti&#x27;s independence. Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as the nation&#x27;s first president (1977–1999).

<doc id="538153" wikidata="Q4709751" url="?curid=538153" title="Albert Bigelow">
<text>Albert Smith Bigelow (1 May 1906 – 6 October 1993) was a pacifist and former United States Navy Commander, who came to prominence in the 1950s as the skipper of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, the first vessel to attempt disruption of a nuclear test in protest against nuclear weapons.

==Early life==
Bigelow (1906-1993) was the son of Albert Francis Bigelow (1880-1958), and Gladys Williams. Albert&#x27;s father was a partner in the Boston law firm Warren, Hogue &amp; Bigelow from 1908 to 1914. His sister was Martha Bigelow, who married Theodore L. Eliot, the grandson of Charles William Eliot, president of Harvard.

Bigelow was a graduate of both Harvard University, in 1929, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in architecture. While at Harvard, he was a member of the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, Stylus, Iroquois and Fly Clubs, as well as a member of the Harvard hockey team.

==Navy Service==
Bigelow served in the United States Navy during World War II, first as commander of a submarine chaser patrolling the Solomon Islands, and later as captain of the destroyer escort On August 6, 1945, Bigelow was on the bridge of the &quot;Peterson&quot; as it sailed into Pearl Harbor, when he heard news of the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. He resigned from the US Naval Reserve a month before becoming eligible for his pension.

==Involvement in peace movement==
In 1948, Bigelow&#x27;s wife, Sylvia, joined the Religious Society of Friends. Bigelow joined in 1955. It was through the Society of Friends that Albert and Sylvia came to house two of the Hiroshima Maidens: young Japanese women, severely disfigured by the effects of the atomic bomb, who were brought to the United States to undergo plastic surgery in 1955. Bigelow was humbled by the experience, in particular by his realization that the two young women &quot;harbored no resentment against us or other Americans&quot;.

Bigelow became involved with the American Friends Service Committee in the mid-1950s, attempting to deliver a 17,411 signature petition, opposing atmospheric nuclear tests, to the White House via Maxwell M. Rabb, Cabinet Secretary. Repeated attempts to gain an appointment with Rabb were unsuccessful, leading Bigelow to conclude that other measures must be taken.

On August 6, 1957, on the 12th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Bigelow and twelve other members of the newly formed Committee for Non-Violent Action were arrested when they attempted to enter the Camp Mercury nuclear test site in Nevada, as part of a nonviolent vigil against the testing. The following day, they returned and sat with their backs towards the site as the nuclear test took place.

==Sailing &quot;The Golden Rule&quot;==

In February, 1958, Bigelow set sail for the Eniwetok Proving Ground, the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s atmospheric test site in the Marshall Islands, in the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, a ketch. He was accompanied by crew members James Peck, George Willoughby, William R. Huntington, and Orion Sherwood. The voyage had been deliberately and widely publicized, and while the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; was en route to Hawaii, the Atomic Energy Commission hastily issued a regulation banning US citizens from sailing into the Proving Grounds.

When they arrived in Hawaii, the crew of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; were issued a court summons, resulting in a temporary injunction against any attempt to sail to the test site. Bigelow chose to break the injunction on May 1, but the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; was intercepted by the US Coast Guard only from Honolulu. A second attempt on June 4 was also unsuccessful – the crew were arrested, charged with contempt of court and sentenced to sixty days in jail.

But while the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; was docked in Honolulu, Bigelow and crew had met Earle and Barbara Reynolds. Earle L. Reynolds was an anthropologist who had visited Hiroshima to study the effects of the atomic bomb on Japanese society. Hearing of the plight of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, Earle and Barbara were inspired to take their own nonviolent action, and later that year their yacht, the &quot;Phoenix of Hiroshima&quot; became the first vessel to enter a nuclear test zone in protest when they sailed sixty-five nautical miles into the test area at Bikini Atoll. Earle was arrested and sentenced to six months in jail.

In 1959, Bigelow published a book, &quot;Voyage of the Golden Rule&quot; which documented his journey. Bigelow&#x27;s story would go on to inspire fellow Quaker Marie Bohlen to suggest the use of a similar tactic to members of the Vancouver-based Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee (later to become Greenpeace) in 1970.

Bigelow continued to take part in non-violent protests during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was a participant in the Freedom Rides organized by the Congress on Racial Equality in 1961.

In his later years, from 1971 to 1975, he was a trustee to The Meeting School, a Quaker school in Rindge, New Hampshire.

==Personal life==
Bigelow married his first wife, Josephine Rotch, the daughter of Arthur and Helen (née Ludington) Rotch, on June 21, 1929. She was a debutante of 1927 and was a member of the Junior League and Vincent Club of Boston. She, however, had resumed her affair with Harry Crosby within two months of their marriage, and then, on 10 December that year she and Crosby were found dead in an apparent murder suicide.

Two years later, Albert married Sylvia Weld, daughter of Rudolph and Sylvia Caroline (née Parsons) Weld, on September 10, 1931. Sylvia was a granddaughter of Gen. William Barclay Parsons (1859–1932), the chief engineer of New York&#x27;s first subway. Her great-grandparents were William Barclay Parsons (1828–1887) and Eliza (née Livingston) Parsons. Together, they had three daughters, Lisa, Kate, and Mary, their youngest, who died when she was seven months old.

Bigelow died, aged 87, at a nursing home in Walpole, Massachusetts in 1993.

<text>Southeast Texas is a cultural and geographic region in the U.S. state of Texas, bordering Southwest Louisiana and its greater Acadiana region to the east. Being a part of East Texas, the region is geographically centered on the Greater Houston and Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan statistical areas with a combined population of 7,662,325 according to the 2020 U.S. census.

== Geography ==
Southeast Texas includes part of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and most of the Texas portion of the Intracoastal Waterway. The area is also crossed by numerous rivers and streams, the largest three being the Sabine River, the Neches River, and the Trinity River.

In Southeast Texas and the rest of the Southern United States, small rivers and creeks collect into swamps called &quot;bayous&quot; and merge with the surrounding forest. The only large bodies of water in Southeast Texas are Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake, but the large reservoirs of the remainder of East Texas are just to the north. The eastern portion of Southeast Texas is geographically and culturally attached to Southwest Louisiana, though western, southern and northern areas maintain their own distinct Texan cultural identities.

Near the coast, the land is low and extremely flat, and often marshy. The Piney Woods extend into the northern parts of Southeast Texas, reaching as far south as the rice paddies and marshlands that lie between Houston and Beaumont. The highest point on the coast is at High Island, where a salt dome raises the elevation to around 40feet (12m) above sea level.

Away from the coast, the terrain begins to exhibit the rolling hills of Northeast and Central Texas. Toward Central Texas, the mixed pine and hardwood forests give way to the East Central Texas forests of post oak and grasslands.

=== Golden Triangle ===

The Golden Triangle is an area of extreme Southeast Texas near the Louisiana border. The &quot;triangle&quot; is formed by Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, which are the largest cities in the area. &quot;Golden&quot; refers to the wealth that came from the Spindletop oil strike near Beaumont in 1901. In an attempt to distance the area from the petrochemical industry, some area interests attempted to rename the Golden Triangle as the &quot;Triplex.&quot; This name change did not catch on, and local residents still refer to it as the Golden Triangle. Some residents of the Golden Triangle do not consider the Greater Houston area to be part of Southeast Texas and place the western boundary of the region approximately at the Trinity River, which is roughly 30 miles from downtown Houston.

This area holds the annual South Texas State Fair in Beaumont.

===Big Thicket===
The Big Thicket is an area of dense forest located in the area just north and northwest of the city of Beaumont. There are many small towns in this area, including Woodville and Kountze.

The Big Thicket National Preserve protects part of the old thicket, highlighting the area&#x27;s biological resources. The 97,000 acre (390 km2) preserve boasts a varied ecology of piney woods, swamps, and coastal prairies. It includes extremely diverse range of plant species including orchids, cactus, cypress, and pine in close proximity to each other. Approximately 65,000 people visit this area each year.

Two historically important routes cross the Big Thicket: to the north lies the old cattle route or Beef Trail, that ran from Tyler County to Louisiana; to the south is the Spanish Trail or the Atascosito Road, that parallels modern Highway90 and Interstate10 from Liberty to Orange.

=== Galveston Bay ===

Galveston Bay is a large estuary located along Texas upper coast. The bay is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, numerous local bayous, and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. The bay covers approximately 600 square miles (1,500 km2), and is 30 miles (50 km) long and 17 miles (27 km) wide. Galveston Bay is on average 7–9feet (2-3m) deep. The bay has three inlets to the Gulf of Mexico: Bolivar Roads (the exit of the Houston Ship Channel) between Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula, San Luis Pass to the west, and Rollover Pass to the east.

The Houston Ship Channel, connecting the Port of Houston to the Gulf, passes through Galveston Bay. Houston is the largest city on the bay, while smaller ones include Galveston, Pasadena, Baytown, and Texas City. The bay provides nursery and spawning grounds for large amounts of marine life and is important for both commercial and recreational fishing.

=== Climate ===

Compared to the rest of the state, Southeast Texas&#x27; climate is warmer in winter and cooler in summer. On average, the region receives more rain than other parts of the state, and it experiences a wet season and dry season like the tropics. This can increase the humidity level in the region. The relatively mild and wet climate is largely due to the influence of the Gulf of Mexico. 

The Southeast Texas region can be comparable to that of Southern Louisiana in climate. Average annual rainfall in the Golden Triangle is 60 inches (1,500 mm). Rainfall totals in other parts of Southeast Texas are lower, but still in excess of 40inches (1,000 mm) per year. During Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979, the city of Alvin recorded an official 24-hour rainfall total of 42inches (1,067 mm)—the highest one-day rainfall total ever measured in the United States. Nederland received 66 inches during Harvey. 

Houston has been called the &quot;Lightning Capital of Texas&quot;&quot;,&quot; as its density of lightning strikes is higher than it is in other parts of the state. This area of unusually high lightning activity stretches from Houston eastward into Southwest Louisiana. Much of this can be explained by the natural occurrence of thunderstorms in the region, which form almost daily during the wet season. However, the unusual clustering of lightning around the developed areas of Houston, the Golden Triangle, and Lake Charles, Louisiana have led many researchers to believe that some combination of urban heat islands and air pollution are responsible for increasing the number of lightning strikes beyond even the already-high natural levels. 

Southeast Texas is vulnerable to hurricanes. Major hurricanes that have severely affected the area in the 21st century include Hurricane Rita in 2005; Hurricane Ike, which passed over much of Houston and surrounding areas in 2008; and Hurricane Harvey, which inundated Southeast Texas in 2017. Weaker storms strike the area routinely. Some, like Tropical Storm Allison and Tropical Storm Claudette, have caused considerable damage.

==Culture==

The culture of Southeast Texas is closer to Acadiana in Louisiana or the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, than it is to West Texas; among some of its population, Cajun and Creole identity has been preserved and can be seen during cultural celebrations such as Mardi Gras. Much of contemporary Southeast Texas has its roots in traditions that go back generations; the region is consistent with much of northern and eastern Texas in that it is part of the Bible Belt—an area in which many inhabitants have strongly traditional Protestant Christian beliefs. Additionally, the Catholic Church in the United States has remained a prominent religious influence since Spanish colonization and missionary work. Among its largest cities in East Texas outside Houston, many still follow a rural Southern way of life, especially in dialect, mannerisms, and cuisine.

== Economy ==
In the urban areas of Southeast Texas, energy, healthcare, manufacturing and technology are prominent industries. Houston is the largest city and economic center of Southeast Texas, and it holds the third most Fortune 500 headquarters by concentration in the U.S. as of 2021. Major corporations in the region include APA Corporation, Chevron Corporation, HostGator, Jason&#x27;s Deli, JPMorgan Chase, and Sysco. Outside of the cities, agriculture, tourism and small business have always been major factors in the economy.

== Higher education ==

The University of Houston System is the largest and most prominent university system based in Southeast Texas, although Texas Southern University, Prairie View A&amp;M University, the University of Saint Thomas, Houston Christian University, and others are also notable subjects to the region&#x27;s undergraduate and postgraduate systems. Rice University in Houston was ranked 15th in the nation by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as of 2022. In areas closer to Beaumont, Lamar University within the Texas State University System is the center of higher education.

== Sports ==
Within Southeast Texas, the city of Houston and its metropolitan area has a rich sporting culture and area residents are active in many spectator and participant sports. Spectators attend events including teams from four major professional sports teams and collegiate sports; Beaumont is also the second principal location for collegiate sports. Participants enjoy activities from running in Memorial Park to sailing on Galveston Bay and Clear Lake. A number of other sports are also available, including nearly a dozen fencing clubs, ranging from recreational clubs to elite competitive organizations.

== Transportation ==

There are a variety of highways stretching between the Greater Houston and Beaumont metropolitan areas, connecting the communities to the remainder of the Gulf Coast region of the United States, and the Texas Triangle. Among other modes of transportation, the largest airports operating in Southeast Texas are all stationed in the city of Houston.

<text>Book of the Marvels of the World (Italian: &#x27;, lit. &#x27;The Million&#x27;, possibly derived from Polo&#x27;s nickname &quot;Emilione&quot;), in English commonly called The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is a 13th-century travelogue written down by Rustichello da Pisa from stories told by Venetian explorer Marco Polo. It describes Polo&#x27;s travels through Asia between 1271 and 1295, and his experiences at the court of Kublai Khan.

The book was written by romance writer Rustichello da Pisa, who worked from accounts which he had heard from Marco Polo when they were imprisoned together in Genoa. Rustichello wrote it in Franco-Venetian, a literary language widespread in northern Italy between the subalpine belt and the lower Po between the 13th and 15th centuries. It was originally known as or (&quot;Description of the World&quot;). The book was translated into many European languages in Marco Polo&#x27;s own lifetime, but the original manuscripts are now lost, and their reconstruction is a matter of textual criticism. A total of about 150 copies in various languages are known to exist, including in Old French, Tuscan, two versions in Venetian, and two different versions in Latin.

From the beginning, there has been incredulity over Polo&#x27;s sometimes fabulous stories, as well as a scholarly debate in recent times. Some have questioned whether Marco had actually traveled to China or was just repeating stories that he had heard from other travelers. Economic historian Mark Elvin concludes that recent work &quot;demonstrates by specific example the ultimately overwhelming probability of the broad authenticity&quot; of Polo&#x27;s account, and that the book is, &quot;in essence, authentic, and, when used with care, in broad terms to be trusted as a serious though obviously not always final, witness.&quot;

==History==

The source of the title is debated. One view is it comes from the Polo family&#x27;s use of the name &quot;Emilione&quot; to distinguish themselves from the numerous other Venetian families bearing the name Polo. A more common view is that the name refers to medieval reception of the travelog, namely that it was full of &quot;a million&quot; lies.

Modern assessments of the text usually consider it to be the record of an observant rather than imaginative or analytical traveler. Marco Polo emerges as being curious and tolerant, and devoted to Kublai Khan and the dynasty that he served for two decades. The book is Polo&#x27;s account of his travels to China, which he calls Cathay (north China) and Manji (south China). The Polo party left Venice in 1271. The journey took three years after which they arrived in Cathay as it was then called and met the grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan. They left China in late 1290 or early 1291 and were back in Venice in 1295. The tradition is that Polo dictated the book to a romance writer, Rustichello da Pisa, while in prison in Genoa between 1298 and 1299. Rustichello may have worked up his first Franco-Italian version from Marco&#x27;s notes. The book was then named and in French, and in Latin.

===Role of Rustichello===
The British scholar Ronald Latham has pointed out that &quot;The Book of Marvels&quot; was in fact a collaboration written in 1298–1299 between Polo and a professional writer of romances, Rustichello of Pisa. It is believed that Polo related his memoirs orally to Rustichello da Pisa while both were prisoners of the Genova Republic. Rustichello wrote &quot;Devisement du Monde&quot; in the Franco-Venetian language.

Latham also argued that Rustichello may have glamorised Polo&#x27;s accounts, and added fantastic and romantic elements that made the book a bestseller. The Italian scholar Luigi Foscolo Benedetto had previously demonstrated that the book was written in the same &quot;leisurely, conversational style&quot; that characterised Rustichello&#x27;s other works, and that some passages in the book were taken verbatim or with minimal modifications from other writings by Rustichello. For example, the opening introduction in &quot;The Book of Marvels&quot; to &quot;emperors and kings, dukes and marquises&quot; was lifted straight out of an Arthurian romance Rustichello had written several years earlier, and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter&#x27;s court is almost the same as that of the arrival of Tristan at the court of King Arthur at Camelot in that same book. Latham believed that many elements of the book, such as legends of the Middle East and mentions of exotic marvels, may have been the work of Rustichello who was giving what medieval European readers expected to find in a travel book.

=== Role of the Dominican Order ===
Apparently, from the very beginning Marco&#x27;s story aroused contrasting reactions, as it was received by some with a certain disbelief. The Dominican father was the author of a translation into Latin, in 1302, just a few years after Marco&#x27;s return to Venice. Francesco Pipino solemnly affirmed the truthfulness of the book and defined Marco as a &quot;prudent, honoured and faithful man&quot;. In his writings, the Dominican brother Jacopo d&#x27;Acqui explains why his contemporaries were skeptical about the content of the book. He also relates that before dying, Marco Polo insisted that &quot;he had told only a half of the things he had seen&quot;.

According to some recent research of the Italian scholar Antonio Montefusco, the very close relationship that Marco Polo cultivated with members of the Dominican Order in Venice suggests that local fathers collaborated with him for a Latin version of the book, which means that Rustichello&#x27;s text was translated into Latin for a precise will of the Order.

Since Dominican fathers had among their missions that of evangelizing foreign peoples (cf. the role of Dominican missionaries in China and in the Indies), it is reasonable to think that they considered Marco&#x27;s book as a trustworthy piece of information for missions in the East. The diplomatic communications between Pope Innocent IV and Pope Gregory X with the Mongols were probably another reason for this endorsement. At the time, there was open discussion of a possible Christian-Mongol alliance with an anti-Islamic function. In fact, a Mongol delegate was solemnly baptised at the Second Council of Lyon. At the council, Pope Gregory X promulgated a new Crusade to start in 1278 in liaison with the Mongols.

==Contents==
&quot;The Travels&quot; is divided into four books. Book One describes the lands of the Middle East and Central Asia that Marco encountered on his way to China. Book Two describes China and the court of Kublai Khan. Book Three describes some of the coastal regions of the East: Japan, India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia, and the east coast of Africa. Book Four describes some of the then-recent wars among the Mongols and some of the regions of the far north, like Russia. Polo&#x27;s writings included descriptions of cannibals and spice-growers.

==Legacy==

&quot;The Travels&quot; was a rare popular success in an era before printing.

The impact of Polo&#x27;s book on cartography was delayed: the first map in which some names mentioned by Polo appear was in the &quot;Catalan Atlas of Charles V&quot; (1375), which included thirty names in China and a number of other Asian toponyms. In the mid-fifteenth century the cartographer of Murano, Fra Mauro, meticulously included all of Polo&#x27;s toponyms in his 1450 map of the world.

A heavily annotated copy of Polo&#x27;s book was among the belongings of Columbus.

==Subsequent versions==
Marco Polo was accompanied on his trips by his father and uncle (both of whom had been to China previously), though neither of them published any known works about their journeys. The book was translated into many European languages in Marco Polo&#x27;s own lifetime, but the original manuscripts are now lost. A total of about 150 copies in various languages are known to exist. During copying and translating many errors were made, so there are many differences between the various copies.

According to the French philologist Philippe Ménard, there are six main versions of the book: the version closest to the original, in Franco-Venetian; a version in Old French; a version in Tuscan; two versions in Venetian; two different versions in Latin.

=== Version in Franco-Venetian ===
The oldest surviving Polo manuscript is in Franco-Venetian, which was a literary language which mixed Old French with the Venetian language, spread in Northern Italy in the 13th century; for Luigi Foscolo Benedetto, this &quot;F&quot; text is the basic original text, which he corrected by comparing it with the somewhat more detailed Italian of Ramusio, together with a Latin manuscript in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana.

=== Version in Old French ===
A version written in Old French, titled (The Book of Marvels).
: This version counts 18 manuscripts, whose most famous is the Code Fr. 2810. Famous for its miniatures, the Code 2810 is in the French National Library. Another Old French Polo manuscript, dating to around 1350, is held by the National Library of Sweden. A critical edition of this version was edited in the 2000s by Philippe Ménard.

=== Version in Tuscan ===
A version in Tuscan (Italian language) titled was written in Florence by Michele Ormanni. It is found in the Italian National Library in Florence.
Other early important sources are the manuscript &quot;R&quot; (Ramusio&#x27;s Italian translation first printed in 1559).

=== Version in Venetian ===
The version in Venetian dialect is full of mistakes and is not considered trustworthy.

===Versions in Latin===
* One of the early manuscripts, , was a translation into Latin made by the Dominican brother Francesco Pipino in 1302, only three years after Marco&#x27;s return to Venice. This testifies the deep interest the Dominican Order had in the book. According to recent research by the Italian scholar Antonio Montefusco, the very close relationship Marco Polo cultivated with members of the Dominican Order in Venice suggests that Rustichello&#x27;s text was translated into Latin for a precise will of the Order, which had among its missions that of evangelizing foreign peoples (cf. the role of Dominican missionaries in China and in the Indies). This Latin version is conserved by 70 manuscripts.
* Another Latin version called &quot;Z&quot; is conserved only by one manuscript, which is to be found in Toledo, Spain. This version contains about 300 small curious additional facts about religion and ethnography in the Far East. Experts wondered whether these additions were from Marco Polo himself.

=== Critical editions ===
The first attempt to collate manuscripts and provide a critical edition was in a volume of collected travel narratives printed at Venice in 1559.

The editor, Giovan Battista Ramusio, collated manuscripts from the first part of the fourteenth century, which he considered to be &quot;&quot; (&quot;perfectly correct&quot;). The edition of Benedetto, , under the patronage of the (Florence: Olschki, 1928), collated sixty additional manuscript sources, in addition to some eighty that had been collected by Henry Yule, for his 1871 edition. It was Benedetto who identified Rustichello da Pisa, as the original compiler or amanuensis, and his established text has provided the basis for many modern translations: his own in Italian (1932), and Aldo Ricci&#x27;s &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot; (London, 1931).

The first English translation is the Elizabethan version by John Frampton published in 1579, &quot;The most noble and famous travels of Marco Polo&quot;, based on Santaella&#x27;s Castilian translation of 1503 (the first version in that language).

A. C. Moule and Paul Pelliot published a translation under the title &quot;Description of the World&quot; that uses manuscript F as its base and attempts to combine the several versions of the text into one continuous narrative while at the same time indicating the source for each section (London, 1938). 

An introduction to Marco Polo is Leonard Olschki, &quot;Marco Polo&#x27;s Asia: An Introduction to His &quot;Description of the World&quot; Called &quot;Il Milione&quot;&quot;, translated by John A. Scott (Berkeley: University of California) 1960; it had its origins in the celebrations of the seven hundredth anniversary of Marco Polo&#x27;s birth.

==Authenticity and veracity==
Since its publication, many have viewed the book with skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages viewed the book simply as a romance or fable, largely because of the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as &quot;barbarians&quot; who appeared to belong to &quot;some other world&quot;. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo&#x27;s narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention a number of things and practices commonly associated with China, such as Chinese characters, tea, chopsticks, and footbinding. In particular, his failure to mention the Great Wall of China had been noted as early as the middle of the seventeenth century. In addition, the difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used also raised suspicion about Polo&#x27;s accounts. Many have questioned whether or not he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, or he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, or doubted that he even reached China and that, if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).

Historian Stephen G. Haw however argued that many of the &quot;omissions&quot; could be explained. For example, none of the other Western travelers to Yuan dynasty China at that time, such as Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, mentioned the Great Wall, and that while remnants of the Wall would have existed at that time, it would not have been significant or noteworthy as it had not been maintained for a long time. The Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo&#x27;s visit were those very northern invaders. The Mongol rulers whom Polo served also controlled territories both north and south of today&#x27;s wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. He noted the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo&#x27;s travels. The Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta did mention the Great Wall, but when he asked about the wall while in China during the Yuan dynasty, he could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it. Haw also argued that practices such as footbinding were not common even among Chinese during Polo&#x27;s time and almost unknown among the Mongols. While the Italian missionary Odoric of Pordenone who visited Yuan China mentioned footbinding (it is however unclear whether he was only relaying something he heard as his description is inaccurate), no other foreign visitors to Yuan China mentioned the practice, perhaps an indication that the footbinding was not widespread or was not practiced in an extreme form at that time. Marco Polo himself noted (in the Toledo manuscript) the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very short steps.

It has also been pointed out that Polo&#x27;s accounts are more accurate and detailed than other accounts of the periods. Polo had at times denied the &quot;marvelous&quot; fables and legends given in other European accounts, and also omitted descriptions of strange races of people then believed to inhabit eastern Asia and given in such accounts. For example, Odoric of Pordenone said that the Yangtze river flows through the land of pygmies only three spans high and gave other fanciful tales, while Giovanni da Pian del Carpine spoke of &quot;wild men, who do not speak at all and have no joints in their legs&quot;, monsters who looked like women but whose menfolk were dogs, and other equally fantastic accounts. Despite a few exaggerations and errors, Polo&#x27;s accounts are relatively free of the descriptions of irrational marvels, and in many cases where present (mostly given in the first part before he reached China), he made a clear distinction that they are what he had heard rather than what he had seen. It is also largely free of the gross errors in other accounts such as those given by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta who had confused the Yellow River with the Grand Canal and other waterways, and believed that porcelain was made from coal.

Many of the details in Polo&#x27;s accounts have been verified. For example, when visiting Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, China, Marco Polo noted that a large number of Christian churches had been built there. His claim is confirmed by a Chinese text of the 14th century explaining how a Sogdian named Mar-Sargis from Samarkand founded six Nestorian Christian churches there in addition to one in Hangzhou during the second half of the 13th century. Nestorian Christianity had existed in China since the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) when a Persian monk named Alopen came to the capital Chang&#x27;an in 635 to proselytize, as described in a dual Chinese and Syriac language inscription from Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) dated to the year 781.

In 2012, the University of Tübingen sinologist and historian Hans Ulrich Vogel released a detailed analysis of Polo&#x27;s description of currencies, salt production and revenues, and argued that the evidence supports his presence in China because he included details which he could not have otherwise known. Vogel noted that no other Western, Arab, or Persian sources have given such accurate and unique details about the currencies of China, for example, the shape and size of the paper, the use of seals, the various denominations of paper money as well as variations in currency usage in different regions of China, such as the use of cowry shells in Yunnan, details supported by archaeological evidence and Chinese sources compiled long after Polo&#x27;s had left China. His accounts of salt production and revenues from the salt monopoly are also accurate, and accord with Chinese documents of the Yuan era. Economic historian Mark Elvin, in his preface to Vogel&#x27;s 2013 monograph, concludes that Vogel &quot;demonstrates by specific example after specific example the ultimately overwhelming probability of the broad authenticity&quot; of Polo&#x27;s account. Many problems were caused by the oral transmission of the original text and the proliferation of significantly different hand-copied manuscripts. For instance, did Polo exert &quot;political authority&quot; () in Yangzhou or merely &quot;sojourn&quot; () there? Elvin concludes that &quot;those who doubted, although mistaken, were not always being casual or foolish&quot;, but &quot;the case as a whole had now been closed&quot;: the book is, &quot;in essence, authentic, and, when used with care, in broad terms to be trusted as a serious though obviously not always final, witness&quot;.

==Other travelers==
Although Marco Polo was certainly the most famous, he was not the only nor the first European traveler to the Mongol Empire who subsequently wrote an account of his experiences. Earlier thirteenth-century European travelers who journeyed to the court of the Great Khan were André de Longjumeau, William of Rubruck and Giovanni da Pian del Carpine with Benedykt Polak. None of them however reached China itself. Later travelers such as Odoric of Pordenone and Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli reached China during the Yuan dynasty and wrote accounts of their travels.

The Moroccan merchant Ibn Battuta traveled through the Golden Horde and China subsequently in the early-to-mid-14th century. The 14th-century author John Mandeville wrote an account of journeys in the East, but this was probably based on second-hand information and contains much apocryphal information.

<doc id="538170" wikidata="Q845477" url="?curid=538170" title="Exchange-traded fund">
<text>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that is also an exchange-traded product, i.e., it is traded on stock exchanges. ETFs own financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, debts, futures contracts, and/or commodities such as gold bars. Many ETFs provide some level of diversification compared to owning an individual stock.

An ETF divides ownership of itself into shares that are held by shareholders. Depending on the country, the legal structure of an ETF can be a corporation, trust, open-end management investment company, or unit investment trust. Shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund and are entitled to a share of the profits, such as interest or dividends, and would be entitled to any residual value if the fund undergoes liquidation. They also receive annual reports. An ETF generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value, although deviations can occur.

The largest ETFs, which passively track stock market indices, have annual expense ratios as low as 0.03% of the amount invested, although specialty ETFs can have annual fees of 1% or more of the amount invested. These fees are paid to the ETF issuer out of dividends received from the underlying holdings or from the sale of assets.

In the United States, there is $5.4 trillion invested in equity ETFs and $1.4 trillion invested in fixed-income ETFs. In Europe, there is $1.0 trillion invested in equity ETFs and $0.4 trillion invested in fixed-income ETFs. In Asia, there is $0.9 trillion invested in equity ETFs and $0.1 trillion invested in fixed-income ETFs. In the first quarter of 2023, trading in ETFs accounted for 32% of the total dollar volume of stock market trading in the US, 11% of trading volume in Europe, and 13% of trading volume in Asia.

In the US, the largest ETF issuers are BlackRock iShares with a 34% market share, Vanguard with a 29% market share, State Street Global Advisors with a 14% market share, Invesco with a 5% market share, and Charles Schwab with a 4% market share.

ETFs are regulated by governmental bodies (such as the SEC and the CFTC in the United States) and are subject to securities laws (such as the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States).

Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs; even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange they do not change the number of shares they have issued, unlike an ETF. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments that are not exchange-traded funds.

==ETFs vs. mutual funds==
ETFs are similar in many ways to mutual funds, except that ETFs are bought and sold from other owners throughout the day on stock exchanges, whereas mutual funds are bought and sold from the issuer based on their price at day&#x27;s end. ETFs are also more transparent since their holdings are generally published online daily and, in the United States, are more tax efficient than mutual funds. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade on a stock exchange, can be sold short, can be purchased using funds borrowed from a stockbroker (margin), and can be purchased and sold using limit orders, with the buyer or seller aware of the price per share in advance.

===Costs and fees===
Both ETFs and mutual funds charge annual expense ratios that range from 0.02% of the investment value to upwards of 1% of the investment value. Mutual funds generally have higher annual fees since they have higher marketing, distribution and accounting expenses (12b-1 fees). ETFs are also generally cheaper to operate since, unlike mutual funds, they do not have to buy and sell securities and maintain cash reserves to accommodate shareholder purchases and redemptions.

Stockbrokers may charge different commissions, if any, for the purchase and sale of ETFs and mutual funds. In addition, sales of ETFs in the United States are subject to transaction fees that the national securities exchanges must pay to the SEC under section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which, as of February 2023, is $8 per $1 million in transaction proceeds. Many mutual funds can be bought commission-free from the issuer, although some charge front-end or back-end loads, while ETFs do not have loads at all.

===Taxation===
In the United States, ETFs can be more attractive tax-wise than mutual funds for transactions made in taxable accounts. However, there are no tax benefits to ETFs compared to mutual funds in the United Kingdom and Germany.

In the US, whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss (i.e. when the fund sells appreciated shares to meet investor redemptions), its shareholders who hold the fund in taxable accounts often pay capital gains taxes on their share of the gain. However, ETF investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares for a gain.

ETFs offered by Vanguard are actually a different share class of its mutual funds and do not stand on their own; however, they generally do not have any adverse tax issues.

===Trading===
ETFs can be bought and sold at current market prices at any time during the trading day, unlike mutual funds, which can only be traded at the end of the trading day. Also unlike mutual funds, investors can execute the same types of trades that they can with a stock, such as limit orders, which allow investors to specify the price points at which they are willing to trade, stop-loss orders, margin buying, hedging strategies, and there is no minimum investment requirement. ETFs can be traded frequently to hedge risk or implement market timing investment strategies, whereas many mutual funds have restrictions on frequent trading.

Options, including put options and call options, can be written or purchased on most ETFs – which is not possible with mutual funds, allowing investors to implement strategies such as covered calls on ETFs. There are also several ETFs that implement covered call strategies within the funds.

Many mutual funds must be held in an account at the issuing firm, while ETFs can be traded via any stockbroker. Some stockbrokers do not allow for automatic recurring investments or trading fractional shares of ETFs, while these are allowed by all mutual fund issuers.

The most popular ETFs such as those tracking the S&amp;P 500 trade tens of millions of shares per day and have strong market liquidity, while there are many ETFs that do not trade very often, and thus might be difficult to sell compared to more liquid ETFs. The most active ETFs are &quot;very&quot; liquid, with high regular trading volume and tight bid-ask spreads (the gap between buyer and seller&#x27;s prices), and the price thus fluctuates throughout the day. This is in contrast with mutual funds, where all purchases or sales on a given day are executed at the same price at the end of the trading day.

===Transparency===
Issuers are required by regulators to publish the composition of their portfolios on their websites daily, or quarterly in the case of active non-transparent ETFs.

ETFs are priced continuously throughout the trading day and therefore have price transparency.

==Categories of ETFs==
===Index ETFs===
Index ETFs - Most ETFs are index funds: that is, they track the performance of an index generally by holding the same securities in the same proportions as a certain stock market index, bond market index or other economic index. Examples of large Index ETFs include the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (), which tracks the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500, which are issued by The Vanguard Group (), iShares (), and State Street Corporation (), ETFs that track the NASDAQ-100 index (), and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (), which tracks the Russell 2000 Index, entirely composed of companies with small market capitalizations. Other funds track indices of a certain country or include only companies that are not based in the United States; for example, the Vanguard Total International Stock Index ETF () tracks the MSCI All Country World ex USA Investable Market Index, the iShares MSCI EAFE Index ETF () tracks the MSCI EAFE Index, and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF () tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets index. Some ETFs track a specific type of company, such as the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (), which tracks the &quot;growth&quot; stocks in the Russell 1000 Index. State Street Corporation has issued ETFs that track the components of the S&amp;P 500 in each industry: for example, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund () tracks the components of the S&amp;P 500 that are in the technology industry and The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks the components of the S&amp;P 500 that are in the financial industry. The iShares Select Dividend ETF replicates an index of high dividend paying stocks. Other indexes on which ETFs are based focus on specific niche areas, such as sustainable energy or environmental, social and corporate governance. Most index ETFs invest 100% of their assets proportionately in the securities underlying an index, a manner of investing called replication. Some index ETFs such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which tracks the performance of thousands of underlying securities, use representative sampling, investing 80% to 95% of their assets in the securities of an underlying index and investing the remaining 5% to 20% of their assets in other holdings, such as futures, option and swap contracts, and securities not in the underlying index, that the fund&#x27;s adviser believes will help the ETF to achieve its investment objective.

Factor ETFs are index funds that use enhanced indexing, which combines active management with passive management in an attempt to beat the returns of an index. Factor ETFs tend to have slightly higher expense ratios and volatility than strictly passive index ETFs.

Synthetic ETFs, which are common in Europe but rare in the United States, are a type of index ETF that does not own securities but tracks indexes using derivatives and swaps. They have raised concern due to lack of transparency in products and increasing complexity; conflicts of interest; and lack of regulatory compliance. A synthetic ETF has counterparty risk, because the counterparty is contractually obligated to match the return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty, which arguably could be of dubious quality. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 (UCITS). Counterparty risk is also present where the ETF engages in securities lending or total return swaps. The difference between the performance of an index fund and the index itself is called the tracking error; this difference is usually negative, except during flash crashes and other periods of extreme market turbulence, for index funds that do not use full replication, and for indices that consist of illiquid assets such as high-yield debt.

===Actively managed ETFs===
Actively managed ETFs include active management, whereby the manager executes a specific trading strategy instead of replicating the performance of a stock market index. The securities held by such funds are posted on their websites daily, or quarterly in the cases of active non-transparent ETFs. The ETFs may then be at risk from people who might engage in front running since the portfolio reports can reveal the manager&#x27;s trading strategy. Some actively managed equity ETFs address this problem by trading only weekly or monthly. The largest actively managed ETFs are the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (), which charges 0.35% in annual fees, JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (), which charges 0.18% in annual fees, and the Pimco Enhanced Short Duration ETF (), which charges 0.36% in annual fees.

===Thematic ETFs===
Thematic ETFs are ETFs, including both Index ETFs and actively managed ETFs, that focus on a theme such as disruptive technologies, climate change, shifting consumer behaviors, cloud computing, robotics, electric vehicles, the gig economy, e-commerce, or clean energy. Research reveals the subjective nature of defining thematic investments, such as AI-themed ETFs, often caused by opaque selection criteria, proposing a data-driven methodology using corporate disclosures to improve transparency. The SEC recently charged two investment advisors with &quot;AI washing&quot; for exaggerating their AI involvement to exploit market enthusiasm.

===Bond ETFs===
Bond ETFs are exchange-traded funds that invest in bonds. Bond ETFs generally have much more market liquidity than individual bonds.

===Commodity ETFs===
Commodity ETFs invest in commodities such as precious metals, agricultural products, or hydrocarbons such as petroleum and are subject to different regulations than ETFs that own securities. Commodity ETFs are generally structured as exchange-traded grantor trusts, which gives a direct interest in a fixed portfolio. SPDR Gold Shares, a gold exchange-traded fund, is a grantor trust, and each share represents ownership of one-tenth of an ounce of gold. Most commodity ETFs own the physical commodity. SPDR Gold Shares () owns over 40 million ounces of gold in trust, iShares Silver Trust () owns 18,000 tons of silver, Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares () owns almost 200,000 ounces of palladium, and Aberdeen Standard Physical Platinum Shares ETF () owns over 1.1 million ounces of platinum. However, many ETFs such as the United States Oil Fund by United States Commodity Funds () only own futures contracts, which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity. In these cases, the funds simply roll the delivery month of the contracts forward from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll. They can also be index funds tracking commodity indices.

===Currency ETFs===
Currency ETFs enable investors to invest in or short any major currency or a basket of currencies. They are issued by Invesco and Deutsche Bank among others. Investors can profit from the foreign exchange spot change, while receiving local institutional interest rates, and a collateral yield.

===Leveraged ETFs===

Leveraged ETFs (LETFs) and Inverse ETFs, use investments in derivatives to seek a daily return that corresponds to a multiple of, or the inverse (opposite) of, the daily performance of an index. For example, Direxion offers leveraged ETFs and inverse exchange-traded funds that attempt to produce 3x the daily result of either investing in () or shorting () the S&amp;P 500. To achieve these results, the issuers use various financial engineering techniques, including equity swaps, derivatives, futures contracts, and rebalancing, and re-indexing. The rebalancing and re-indexing of leveraged ETFs may have considerable costs when markets are volatile. Leveraged ETFs effectively increase exposure ahead of a losing session and decrease exposure ahead of a winning session. This is called volatility drag or volatility tax. The rebalancing problem is that the fund manager incurs trading losses because he needs to buy when the index goes up and sell when the index goes down in order to maintain a fixed leverage ratio. Leverage possesses a dual nature, as it has the potential to result in substantial profits, yet it also carries the risk of substantial losses.

===Cryptocurrency ETFs===
Cryptocurrency ETFs invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a basket of different cryptocurrencies. There are two types of crypto ETFs. Spot crypto ETFs invest directly in cryptocurrencies, tracking their real-time prices, and their share prices will fluctuate with the prices of the cryptocurrencies they hold. On the other hand, future-based crypto ETFs refer to equities that do not invest directly in cryptocurrencies but rather in crypto futures contracts. These contracts are agreements to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a predetermined price in the future. As a result, the share prices and price fluctuating trends of funds in these two types could be different, even though they hold identical cryptocurrencies and amounts. Buffer funds allow investors to invest in cryptocurrency while offering downside protection in exchange for capped upside or a portion of gains. ETFs offering exposure to meme coins like Dogecoin and $Trump are in development for launch in 2025.

==Arbitrage mechanism==
ETF shares are created and redeemed when large broker-dealers called authorized participants (AP) act as market makers and purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF issuer in large blocks, generally 50,000 shares, called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units are generally in kind, with the AP contributing or receiving securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF; the lists of ETF holdings are published online.

The ability to purchase and redeem creation units gives ETFs an arbitrage mechanism intended to minimize the potential deviation between the market price and the net asset value of ETF shares. APs provide market liquidity for the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the net asset value of the underlying assets. Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on the secondary market.

If there is strong investor demand for an ETF, its share price will temporarily rise above its net asset value per share, giving arbitrageurs an incentive to purchase additional creation units from the ETF issuer and sell the component ETF shares in the open market. The additional supply of ETF shares reduces the market price per share, generally eliminating the over net asset value. A similar process applies when there is weak demand for an ETF: its shares trade at a discount from their net asset value.

When new shares of an ETF are created due to increased demand, this is referred to as &quot;ETF inflows&quot;. When ETF shares are converted into the component securities, this is referred to as &quot;ETF outflows&quot;.

ETFs are dependent on the efficacy of the arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net asset value.

==History==
ETFs had their genesis in 1989 with Index Participation Shares (IPS), an S&amp;P 500 proxy that traded on the American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. This product was short-lived after a lawsuit by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was successful in stopping sales in the United States. The argument against the IPS approach was that it resembled a futures contract because the investments held an index, rather than holding the actual underlying stocks.

In 1990, a similar product, Toronto Index Participation Shares, which tracked the TSE 35 and later the TSE 100 indices, started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) in 1990. The popularity of these products led the American Stock Exchange to try to develop something that would satisfy regulations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Nathan Most and Steven Bloom, under the direction of Ivers Riley, and with the assistance of Kathleen Moriarty, designed and developed Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Depositary Receipts (), which were introduced in January 1993. Known as SPDRs or &quot;Spiders&quot;, the fund became the largest ETF in the world. In May 1995, State Street Global Advisors introduced the S&amp;P 400 MidCap SPDRs ().

It is a frequent topic in the financial press that ETFs have a quick growth. These popular funds, with assets more than doubling each year since 1995 (as of 2001), have been warmly embraced by most advocates of low–cost index funds. Vanguard is the leading advocate of index funds.

Barclays, in conjunction with MSCI and Funds Distributor Inc., entered the market in 1996 with World Equity Benchmark Shares (WEBS), which became iShares MSCI Index Fund Shares. WEBS originally tracked 17 MSCI country indices managed by the funds&#x27; index provider, Morgan Stanley. WEBS were particularly innovative because they gave casual investors easy access to foreign markets. While SPDRs were organized as unit investment trusts, WEBS were set up as a mutual fund, the first of their kind.

In 1998, State Street Global Advisors introduced &quot;Sector Spiders&quot;, separate ETFs for each of the sectors of the S&amp;P 500. Also in 1998, the &quot;Dow Diamonds&quot; () were introduced, tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 1999, the influential &quot;cubes&quot; was launched, with the goal of replicate the price movement of the NASDAQ-100 – originally &quot;QQQQ&quot; but later .

The iShares line was launched in early 2000. By 2005, it had a 44% market share of ETF assets under management. Barclays Global Investors was sold to BlackRock in 2009.

In 2001, The Vanguard Group entered the market by launching the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (), which owns every publicly traded stock in the United States. Some of Vanguard&#x27;s ETFs are a share class of an existing mutual fund.

iShares issued the first bond funds in July 2002: iShares IBoxx $ Invest Grade Corp Bond Fund (), which owns corporate bonds, and a TIPS fund. In 2007, iShares introduced an ETF that owns high-yield debt and an ETF that owns municipal bonds and State Street Global Advisors and The Vanguard Group also issued bond ETFs.

In December 2005, Rydex (now Invesco) launched the first currency ETF, the Euro Currency Trust (), which tracked the value of the Euro. In 2007, Deutsche Bank&#x27;s db x-trackers launched the EONIA Total Return Index ETF in Frankfurt tracking the Euro. In 2008, it launched the Sterling Money Market ETF () and US Dollar Money Market ETF () in London. In November 2009, ETF Securities launched the world&#x27;s largest FX platform tracking the MSFXSM Index covering 18 long or short USD ETC vs. single G10 currencies.

The first leveraged ETF was issued by ProShares in 2006.

In 2008, the SEC authorized the creation of ETFs that use active management strategies. Bear Stearns launched the first actively managed ETF, the Current Yield ETF (), which began trading on the American Stock Exchange on March 25, 2008.

In December 2014, assets under management by U.S. ETFs reached $2 trillion. By November 2019, assets under management by U.S. ETFs reached $4 trillion. Assets under management by U.S. ETFs grew to $5.5 trillion by January 2021.

In August 2023, a three-judge US court panel for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington overruled an SEC decision denying Grayscale Investments permission to launch a bitcoin-focused ETF. The court&#x27;s decision sets the path for a first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US.

In October 2023, ProShares, VanEck and Bitwise Asset Management launched the first ETFs tied to the value of Ethereum.

Earlier that year. in June, the asset management company BlackRock filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the first spot bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase as a crypto custodian. In January 2024, the SEC approved the creation and trading of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. By May 2024, BlackRock’s ETF had amassed $10bn in assets. It also emerged that ETF issuers had come into ownership of NFTs and other tokens – known as “dust” – as part of their bitcoin holdings. BlackRock alone was said to have $20,000 worth of non-bitcoin tokens. However, the firms could not sell or pass on such dust because that could imperil an ETF’s legal status and force investors to file complex tax paperwork. Blackrock’s policy was to hold unexpected virtual assets in a separate wallet where they could stay in perpetuity or be donated to charity.

In November 2023, BlackRock and Fidelity filed applications with the SEC to launch the first spot Ethereum ETFs. These were allowed the following May, though the SEC set the condition that the funds were not allowed to claim rewards on their coins from the proof-of-stake process. However, not staking tokens meant that the funds would lose about 3% of potential returns a year. Buying 1,000 ether at the start of 2023 (costing $1.2 million) would have netted a gain of $217,000 from staking, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, so a fund with ether worth $10 billion would lose out on rewards worth millions of dollars. That might result in fund issuers charging higher fees to customers to compensate. 

===History of gold ETFs===
The first gold exchange-traded product was Central Fund of Canada, a closed-end fund founded in 1961. It amended its articles of incorporation in 1983 to provide investors with a product for ownership of gold and silver bullion. It has been listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange since 1966 and the American Stock Exchange since 1986.

The idea of a gold ETF was first conceptualized by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India, which filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in May 2002. In March 2007 after delays in obtaining regulatory approval. The first gold exchange-traded fund was Gold Bullion Securities launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first silver exchange-traded fund was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. SPDR Gold Shares, a commodity ETF, is in the top 10 largest ETFs by assets under management.

==Effects on price stability==
Purchases and sales of commodities by ETFs can significantly affect the price of such commodities.

Per the International Monetary Fund, &quot;some market participants believe the growing popularity of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may have contributed to equity price appreciation in some emerging economies and warn that leverage embedded in ETFs could pose financial stability risks if equity prices were to decline for a protracted period.&quot;

ETFs can be and have been used to manipulate market prices, such as in conjunction with short selling that contributed to the United States bear market of 2007–2009.

New regulations to force ETFs to be able to manage systemic stresses were put in place following the 2010 flash crash, when prices of ETFs and other stocks and options became volatile, with trading markets spiking and bids falling as low as a penny a share in what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation described as one of the most turbulent periods in the history of financial markets.

These regulations proved inadequate to protect investors in the August 24, 2015, flash crash, &quot;when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value&quot;. &quot;ETFs were consequently put under even greater scrutiny by regulators and investors.&quot; Analysts at Morningstar, Inc. claimed in December 2015 that &quot;ETFs are a &quot;digital-age technology&quot; governed by &quot;Depression-era legislation&quot;.

==Perception and adoption of ETFs in the European market==
The first European ETF came on the market in 2000, and the European ETF market has seen tremendous growth since. At the end of March 2019, the asset under management in the European industry stood at €760bn, compared with an amount of €100bn at the end of 2008. The market share of ETFs has increased significantly in recent years. At the end of March 2019, ETFs accounted for 8.6% of total AUM in investment funds in Europe, up from 5.5% five years earlier.

The use of ETFs has also evolved over time, as shown by regular observations of investment professionals’ practices in Europe. EDHEC surveys show an increasing propagation of ETF adoption over the years, especially for traditional asset classes. While ETFs are now used across a wide spectrum of asset classes, in 2019, the main use is currently in the area of equities and sectors, for 91% (45% in 2006 ) and 83% of the survey respondents, respectively. This is likely to be linked to the popularity of indexing in these asset classes as well as to the fact that equity indices and sector indices are based on highly liquid instruments, which makes it straightforward to create ETFs on such underlying securities. The other asset classes for which a large share of investors declare using ETFs are commodities and corporate bonds (68% for them both, to be compared with 6% and 15% in 2006, respectively), smart beta-factor investing, and government bonds (66% for them both, to be compared with 13% for government bonds in 2006). Investors have a high rate of satisfaction with ETFs, especially for traditional asset classes. In 2019, we observed 95% satisfaction for both equities and government bond assets.

===The role of ETFs in the asset allocation process===
Over the years, EDHEC survey results have consistently indicated that ETFs are used as part of a truly passive investment approach, mainly for long-term buy-and-hold investment rather than tactical allocation. However, over the past three years, the two approaches have gradually become more balanced, and, in 2019, European investment professionals declared that their use of ETFs for tactical allocation is actually greater than for long-term positions (53% and 51%, respectively).

ETFs, which originally replicated broad market indices, are now available in a wide variety of asset classes and a multitude of market sub-segments (sectors, styles, etc.). If gaining broad market exposure remains the main focus of ETFs for 73% of users in 2019, 52% of respondents will use ETFs to obtain specific sub-segment exposure. The diversity of ETFs increases the possibilities of using ETFs for tactical allocation. Investors can easily increase or decrease their portfolio exposure to a specific style, sector, or factor at a lower cost with ETFs. The more volatile the markets are, the more interesting it is to use low-cost instruments for tactical allocation, especially since cost is a major criterion for selecting an ETF provider for 88% of respondents.

===Expectations for ETF future developments in Europe===
Despite the high current adoption rate of ETFs and the already high maturity of this market, a high percentage of investors (46%) still plan to increase their use of ETFs in the future, according to the EDHEC 2019 survey responses. Investors are planning to increase their ETF allocation to replace active managers (71% of respondents in 2019), but they are also seeking to replace other passive investing products through ETFs (42% of respondents in 2019). Lowering costs is the main motivation for increasing the use of ETFs for 74% of investors. Investors are especially demanding further developments of ETF products in the areas of ethical, socially responsible investing, and smart beta equity and factor indices. In 2018, ESG ETFs enjoyed growth of 50%, reaching €9.95bn, with the launch of 36 new products, compared to just 15 in 2017. However, 31% of the EDHEC 2019 survey respondents still require additional ETF products based on sustainable investment, which appears to be their top concern.

Investors are also demanding ETFs related to advanced forms of equity indices, namely those based on multi-factor and smart beta indices (30% and 28% of respondents, respectively), and 45% of respondents would like to see further developments in at least one category related to smart beta equity or factor indices (smart beta indices, single-factor indices, and multi-factor indices). Consistent with the desire to use ETFs for passive exposure to broad market indices, only 19% of respondents show any interest in the future development of actively managed equity ETFs.

<text>South Padre Island is a barrier island in the U.S. state of Texas. The remote landform is located in Cameron County, Willacy County, and accessible by the Queen Isabella Causeway. South Padre Island was formed when the creation of the Port Mansfield Channel split Padre Island in two. The resort city of South Padre Island, a popular vacation destination, is located on the island.

Before the arrival of European settlers in North America, the island was inhabited by native tribes. Western settlement is considered to have been started by Padre Jose Nicolas Balli, who set up a cattle ranch early in the 19th century. He and his family were driven out by the Mexican–American War and were unable to return because of the American Civil War.

Most of the island was closed by the National Park Service until 1962, after which settlement was not allowed, and incomers began to establish an economy on the island and neighboring Port Isabel. By 1978, the island had a population of around 314; a decade later, it had a population of 1,012 and 111 businesses. Being mainly coastline, the island&#x27;s main source of income is tourism, with tens of thousands of college students flocking to the island every Spring Break. In winter, the island hosts &quot;winter Texans&quot;: people (often retirees) from colder states who winter in the warm Texas climate. Isla Blanca Park, a preserve and recreational park, is located at the southern end of the island.

<doc id="538179" wikidata="Q116544" url="?curid=538179" title="Danny Gare">
<text>Daniel Mirl Gare (born May 14, 1954) is a Canadian broadcaster, ice hockey coach and former National Hockey League (NHL) player, most notably of the Buffalo Sabres. During a 13-year professional career, Gare also played for the Detroit Red Wings and Edmonton Oilers. He was a two-time All-Star right winger who twice scored 50 goals in a season for the Sabres. He was known for his quick wrist shot and status as a small, yet scrappy and fearless player.

==Playing career==
Gare played for the WCJHL&#x27;s Calgary Centennials from 1971 to 1974. In his final season with the team, he had 127 points. Gare was selected by the Buffalo Sabres with the 29th pick of the 1974 NHL amateur draft.

Gare, who wore #18, scored his first career NHL goal just 18 seconds into his first regular season game helping the Sabres defeat the Boston Bruins, 9-5, on October 10, 1974.

In his rookie season of 1974–75, he had 62 points in the regular season and 13 points in the playoffs, as Buffalo went to the Stanley Cup finals. The following year, Gare had 50 goals and 73 points. He had 77 points in 1977–78. In 1979–80, he tied for the league lead with 56 goals and had a career-high 89 points. He then had 85 points the following season.

Because of his goal scoring prowess he played right wing on the power play even during The French Connection years, which pushed René Robert back to the point. He holds team records for most goals by a right winger (267), most game-tying goals (21), and fastest goal scored from start of NHL career (0:18 into his debut versus the Boston Bruins on 10 October 1974).

On December 2, 1981, Gare, along with Jim Schoenfeld and Derek Smith were traded to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for Mike Foligno, Dale McCourt and Brent Peterson. Sabres goalie Bob Sauve was dealt to the Red Wings in a separate transaction. Gare finished his career with the Edmonton Oilers in 1986–87.

Gare served as the Sabres captain from the 1977–78 season through his trade to Detroit. He was the Red Wings captain for four seasons from 1982 through 1986.

==Post-career==
Following his playing career, Gare was briefly an assistant coach and TV color analyst for the Tampa Bay Lightning, and served on the Buffalo Sabres broadcast team on Empire Sports Network. He served as color analyst for the Columbus Blue Jackets under FSN Ohio from 2006 until April 2009. He also served as an interim studio analyst for the Sabres when Mike Robitaille has been unavailable and did color commentary for games that Harry Neale was unable to work. He was appointed the alternate Sabres color analyst and paired with Kevin Sylvester in an effort to reduce the workload of longtime Sabres broadcaster Rick Jeanneret.

Gare was inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame in 1994. On November 22, 2005, Gare had his number 18 jersey retired by the Sabres. He is the fifth player of seven total so honored.

==Achievements and awards==
*WCHL All-Star Team (1974)
*NHL Second All-Star Team (1980)
*NHL All-Star Game (1980, 1981)

<text>Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil is a 1992 American drama film directed and co-written by George Miller. It is based on the true story of Augusto and Michaela Odone, parents who search for a cure for their son Lorenzo&#x27;s adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), leading to the development of Lorenzo&#x27;s oil. The film was shot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, primarily from September 1991 to February 1992. It had a limited release in North America on December 30, 1992, with a nationwide release two weeks later, on January 15, 1993. Though it was a box office disappointment, grossing $7.2 million against its $30 million budget, the film was generally well received by critics and garnered two nominations at the 65th Academy Awards.

==Plot==

Lorenzo is a bright and vibrant young boy living in the Comoro Islands, as his father Augusto Odone works for the World Bank and is stationed there. However, after relocating with his parents to the United States, he begins to show signs of neurological problems (such as falling, loss of hearing, tantrums, etc.). The boy is diagnosed as having adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), which is fatal within two years. Failing to find a doctor capable of treating their son&#x27;s rare disease, Augusto and his wife, Michaela, set out on a mission to find a treatment to save their son. In their quest, the Odones clash with doctors, scientists and a support group that is skeptical that anything could be done about ALD, much less by laypeople. But they persist, setting up camp in medical libraries, reviewing animal experiments, enlisting the aid of Professor Gus Nikolais, badgering researchers, questioning top doctors all over the world and even organizing an international symposium about the disease.

Despite research dead-ends, the horror of watching their son&#x27;s health decline and being surrounded by skeptics (including the coordinators of the support group they attend), they persist until they finally hit upon a possible therapy. The Odones sponsor an international meeting of scientists doing research on ALD, requiring two conditions ahead of time. First they insist that the meeting focus on potential treatments and second, they require that they be allowed to participate, despite being non-scientist laypeople. The pivotal scene in the movie portrays this meeting, in which the scientists are presenting their research. When Dr. William B. Rizzo mentions his studies in which the addition of oleic acid to cultured cells blocked accumulation of the factors which cause ALD, the Odones jump into the conversation, asking if this oil might help their son. Although the scientists play down their hope, pointing out that it would take years of work to produce the oil and test in clinical trials, the Odones seize the promise of this possible curative treatment. As the scene ends, Michaela Odone is shown beginning the effort to find someone able and willing to produce the same oil Dr. Rizzo gave to his cells. They obtain oleic acid from an industrial manufacturer of lubricants, but this only lowers Lorenzo&#x27;s levels by 50% before leveling off, and they realize they are only countering some of the shorter chains produced by one enzyme. To remove the other, they will have to add a distillation of erucic acid. They contact over 100 firms around the world until they find an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, who is working for Croda International and is willing to take on the challenge of distilling the proper formula.

The Odones obtain a precious vial of the oil (actually containing two specific long chain fatty acids, isolated from rapeseed oil and olive oil) and add it to their son&#x27;s diet. This treatment proves successful in normalizing the accumulation of the very long chain fatty acids (which had been causing their son&#x27;s steady decline), as measured in blood levels. This treatment halts the progression of his disease and is dubbed &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot;. This oil is soon found to be successful in preventing the progression of harm in other patients with ALD. Meanwhile, Lorenzo has a great deal of neurological damage, and the Odones are dismayed to see that the oil can reverse their son&#x27;s symptoms only very, very slowly. The Odones realize that more rapid improvement of their son&#x27;s severe condition will require treatments to repair the myelin sheath (a lipid insulator) around the nerves, and Augusto is shown taking on the new challenge of organizing biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients.

Finally, Lorenzo, at the age of 14, shows definite improvement (swallowing for himself and answering &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions by blinking) and it is revealed that he has regained his sight, can move his head from side to side, vocalize simple sounds and is learning to use a computer. The movie ends with scenes of ALD patients who were treated with Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil earlier in the course of their disease. In these patients the devastating neurological degeneration from which Lorenzo suffered was able to be prevented.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal photography for &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; began on September 9, 1991 in the Pittsburgh suburb of Ben Avon, Pennsylvania and continued throughout the city and area.

Possibly to emphasize the &quot;everyman&quot; aspect of the plot (the notion that a cure could affect families and individuals anywhere), many smaller roles were played by inexperienced actors or non-actors with unusual physical features and mannerisms. For example, the poet James Merrill was noticed by a casting director at a New York public reading of his poetry. His rarefied speaking cadences were utilized in a symposium scene in which he played a questioning doctor.

===Music===
The film uses Allegri&#x27;s Miserere, Edward Elgar&#x27;s cello concerto, as well as Barber&#x27;s Adagio for Strings and Mozart&#x27;s Ave verum corpus K.618.

The opening song is &quot;Kijana Mwana Mwali&quot; (Swahili, &quot;Song about a Young Lady&quot;), sung by the Gonda Traditional Entertainers.

A 1960 recording of Maria Callas with the La Scala orchestra and chorus is heard singing selections from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; at several points.

The music for the Easter Midnight Mass scene is a Russian Orthodox Church hymn, &quot;Bogoroditse Devo&quot; (Rejoice, O Virgin) from &quot;Three Choruses from &#x27;Tsar Feodor Ioannovich&#x27;&quot;, taken from the album &quot;Sacred Songs of Russia&quot; by Gloriae Dei Cantores.

Other music include Barber&#x27;s Agnus Dei and Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 5.

The original music from the motion picture soundtrack was scored and composed by Stewart Copeland.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and called it an &quot;immensely moving and challenging movie&quot;, adding that &quot;it was impossible not to get swept up in it.&quot; James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave it three out of four stars and claimed, &quot;it was about the war for knowledge and the victory of hope through perseverance.&quot;

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews from 40 critics to give the film a score of 93%, with an average rating of 7.10/10, . The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A harrowing tribute to the heroism of parental love, &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; is kept from abject misery by George Miller&#x27;s sensitive direction and outstanding performances from Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Medical response===
Though the film seemed to accurately portray the events related to the boy&#x27;s condition and his parents&#x27; efforts during the time period covered by the film, it was criticized for falsely painting a picture of a miracle cure. Subsequent research with Lorenzo&#x27;s oil has not clearly proven its long-term effectiveness in treating ALD after its onset. However, it prevented the onset of ALD in two-thirds of the susceptible boys. The actual subject of the film, Lorenzo Odone, died of pneumonia in May 2008 at the age of 30, having lived two decades longer than originally predicted by doctors.

Hugo Moser, on whom the character of Professor Nikolais was based, called the film&#x27;s portrayal of him &quot;an abomination&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed $7,286,388 domestically with a budget of around $30 million.

<doc id="538184" wikidata="Q455045" url="?curid=538184" title="Amaretto">
<text>Amaretto (Italian for &#x27;a little bitter&#x27;) is a sweet Italian liqueur originating from the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Saronno. Depending on the brand, it may be made from apricot kernels, bitter almonds, peach stones, or almonds, all of which are natural sources of the benzaldehyde that provides the almond-like flavour of the liqueur. It generally contains 21 to 28 percent alcohol by volume.

When served as a beverage, amaretto can be drunk by itself, used as an ingredient to create several popular mixed drinks, or added to coffee. Amaretto is also commonly used in Italian and other cuisines, especially in recipes for confectionery and sweet baked goods.

==Origin==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;amaretto&quot; originated as a diminutive of the Italian word &quot;amaro&quot;, meaning &quot;bitter&quot;, which references the distinctive flavour lent by the &quot;mandorla amara&quot; or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness of amaretto tends to be mild, and sweeteners (and sometimes sweet almonds) enhance the flavour in the final products. Thus, one can interpret the liqueur&#x27;s name as a description of the taste as &quot;a little bitter&quot;. Cyanide is processed out of the almond preparation before its use.

Amaretto is distinct from amaro, a type of bitter Italian liqueur made from herbs, roots, flowers, bark, and/or citrus peels.

===Legend===
Despite the history of introducing and accepting almonds into Italian cuisine, newer takes on the meanings and origins have been popularized by two major brands. Though of sometimes questionable provenance, these tales hold a sentimental place in Saronno culture:

==Notable brands==
*DeKuyper – Netherlands
*Disaronno – Italy
*Lazzaroni – Italy
*Bols – Netherlands
*Luxardo – Italy

==Usage==
Amaretto serves a variety of culinary uses.

===Cooking===
* Amaretto is frequently added to desserts, including ice cream, which enhances the flavour of the dessert with almonds and is complementary to the flavour of chocolate. Tiramisu, a popular Italian cake, is often flavoured with either real amaretto or alcohol-free amaretto aroma.
* Savoury recipes that call for amaretto usually involve meats, such as chicken.
* A few shots of amaretto can be added to pancake batter for a richer flavour.
* Amaretto is often added to almondine sauce for fish and vegetables.
* Amaretto is often added to whipped cream.
* Amaretto chocolate truffles

===Cocktails===
Cocktails with Amaretto liqueur as a primary ingredient:
* &quot;Amaretto Piña Colada&quot; – amaretto liqueur, light rum, coconut milk, and pineapple juice
* &quot;Amaretto sour&quot; – amaretto liqueur, lemon juice, egg white, sugar or simple syrup and orange slice and cherries, for garnish
* &quot;French Connection&quot; – amaretto liqueur and Cognac – IBA official cocktail
* &quot;Godfather&quot; – amaretto liqueur and Scotch
* &quot;Nutcracker Martini&quot; – amaretto liqueur, dark crème de cacao, vodka, and Irish cream
* &quot;Snickerdoodle Cookie Martini&quot; – amaretto liqueur, cinnamon liqueur, and cinnamon vodka
* &quot;Toasted Almond&quot; – amaretto liqueur, coffee liqueur, and milk or cream. Some versions add vodka

===Orgeat syrup===
Amaretto is sometimes used as a substitute for Orgeat syrup in places where the syrup cannot be found or to impart a less sweet flavour.

A Canadian illustrator and writer who won the 2002 Governor General&#x27;s Award for his first children&#x27;s book &quot;Alphabeasts&quot;., Edwards was also the recipient of a multitude of awards and short lists, the Gold Medal from ForeWord Magazine’s Book of the Year Award, and the Children’s Choice Award from the International Reading Association for &quot;Alphabeasts&quot;; the Ruth and Sylvia Schwartz Children’s Book Award, The Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon Illustrator’s Award, the Children’s Choice Award from the International Reading Association for &quot;Monkey Business&quot;; the Canadian Library Association’s Honour for &quot;Mixed Beasts&quot;; and the Junior Library Guild Award for &quot;The Cat’s Pajamas.&quot;

Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Edwards was a graduate of the Ontario College of Art, and his work can be found in numerous public and private collections. He has also worked widely with Metro Toronto Zoo, the City of Toronto, the B.C. Ministry of the Environment, the Canadian Children’s Book Centre, the Canadian Wildlife Federation, and various magazines. (https://quillandquire.com/authors/call-of-the-wild/

On October 16, 2007, Wallace Edwards was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for illustrating &quot;The Painted Circus&quot;. To date, Edwards has both written and illustrated fifteen published books, of which three have been nominated for this, Canada&#x27;s most prestigious literary award.

His art has been described as “Curious and witty, sophisticated and highly original in approach…” resulting in work which is “visually pleasing as well as mentally stimulating” (taken from the Canada Council for the Arts web site). His children’s books have been reviewed in the Quill and Quire, the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, Macleans, the Christian Science Monitor, the National Post, the Detroit Free Press, the Chicago Tribune, the LA Times, the Washington Post, and the School Library Journal, among others.

Edwards was also a pioneering artist in virtual and augmented reality. In 2013 he was the Canada Council supported Artist-in-Residence at York University&#x27;s Future Cinema Lab where he first began to create augmented and immersive materials. He has since gone on to create work in virtual and augmented reality exhibited at the international Electronic Literature Organization conferences in Portugal, Canada and Italy.

Edwards lived in Yarker, Ontario, Canada, and died on December 25, 2022, in Kingston, Ontario, at the age of 65.

== Books ==

As writer and illustrator: 
* &quot;Alphabeasts&quot;
* Monkey Business (2004)
* The Extinct Files: My Science Project (2009)
* Cat&#x27;s pyjamas (2010) &quot;Many young readers are (rightly) allergic to anything that can be described as “exquisite,” but there’s no better word for &quot;The Cat’s Pajamas&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;The painted circus : P.T. Vermin presents a mesmerizing menagerie of trickery and illusion guaranteed to beguile and bamboozle the beholder!&quot; (Toronto: Kids Can Press, 2007), 
* &quot;Uncle Wally&#x27;s Old Brown Shoe&quot; (Vancouver: Orca Book Publishers, 2012)
* Mixed Beasts (2013)
* &quot;Unnatural Selections&quot; (Orca, 2014) &quot;What makes &quot;Unnatural Selections&quot; so magnificent is the attention to detail. Like celebrated Australian author-illustrator Graeme Base (&quot;Animalia&quot;), Edwards creates richly layered scenes bursting with multiple components. Beyond the mythical animals featured in the foreground, readers are encouraged by a reference section at the book’s end to go back and hunt for additional creatures hidden throughout. Hours can be spent poring over every inch of each page, unearthing elements previously unnoticed. In the peripheries live Snailagators, Dorses, Snirds, and even a Frogtopus. No doubt, many readers will delight in searching for these unusual hybrids, but Edwards’ greatest triumph is his ability to encourage us all to discover the strange and wonderful beasts that already dwell in our own imaginations.&quot;
* Once Upon a Line (2015)
* &quot;What is Peace?&quot; (Peace Quest, 2016)
* Woodrow at Sea (2018) &quot;What’s most surprising about &quot;Woodrow at Sea&quot; is that it’s by Wallace Edwards, the beloved Governor General’s Literary Award–winner known for his intricate wordplay and illustrations. With this book, Edwards is moving in a different direction, foregoing his rich, deep-coloured palette for one much brighter, and embracing simplicity in his drawings rather than detail and subtext. Fans will miss his unique voice and style – not to mention witty rhymes – but taken on its own, &quot;Woodrow at Sea&quot; is a delight.&quot; &quot;Wallace describes the narrative arc of this latest book as the Odyssey, much distilled. &quot;It&#x27;s a very simple version of the hero&#x27;s tale, where my elephant protagonist sets off on an adventure, meets a fellow traveller, and finds himself in a situation where each one saves the other.&quot;
* Do you Wonder? (2022)
* Pigs Can`t Fly (2023)

<doc id="538192" wikidata="Q1470388" url="?curid=538192" title="Tunnel of Love (album)">
<text>Tunnel of Love is the eighth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on October 5, 1987. Although members of the E Street Band occasionally performed on the album, Springsteen recorded most of the parts himself, often with drum machines and synthesizers. &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; is not officially regarded as an E Street Band album, as &quot;The Rising&quot; (2002) was marketed as his first studio album with the E Street Band since &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984).

In 1989, the album was ranked No. 25 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot; while in 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at No. 467 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;One Step Up&quot;, &quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot;, and &quot;Spare Parts&quot; were all released as singles. &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; won Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo at the 1988 Grammy Awards.

== Background ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Jon Pareles said that Springsteen &quot;turned inward&quot; on this album, writing about &quot;love gone wrong&quot; in response to changes in his personal life, particularly his crumbling marriage to Julianne Phillips. Pareles said that most of the songs on the album were about the difficulty of mature love rather than Springsteen&#x27;s earlier arena rock anthems to the working man. &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; songs were described as &quot;midtempo ballads or pop-rock hymns&quot;. &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; has been called &quot;a heart-wrenching song about never being really able to know someone&quot;.

On the B-sides of vinyl and cassette singles, outtakes like &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, &quot;Two for the Road&quot; and a 1979 track, &quot;Roulette&quot; were included. On the EP that accompanied the 1988 tour, Springsteen included album cut &quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot;, but included another &quot;River&quot; outtake, &quot;Be True&quot; a rearranged, acoustic &quot;Born To Run&quot;, and a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;.

Commercially the album went triple Platinum in the US on April 19, 1988, with &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; being one of his biggest hit singles, peaking at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; also making the top 10, reaching No. 9, and &quot;One Step Up&quot; reaching the top 20 at No. 13. The 1988 Springsteen and E Street Band Tunnel of Love Express tour would showcase the album&#x27;s songs, sometimes in arrangements courtesy of the Miami Horns.

Amusement park tunnel of love memorabilia was provided by the National Amusement Park Historical Association to be used on the record sleeve of the &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; single. A cover of &quot;All That Heaven Will Allow&quot; was a minor hit single for country band the Mavericks in 1995.

== Music videos ==
Irish filmmaker Meiert Avis directed the music videos for &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot;, &quot;One Step Up&quot;, &quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot;, and &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. The videos were shot on location in New Jersey, including Asbury Park. The intensely personal &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; video broke new ground on MTV, being a single shot without edits. The video of the title track was nominated for five MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year , and Best Editing.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Playboy&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau wrote that, apart from the humorous opening track and the clichéd track that follows, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; is &quot;convincing, original stuff—it zeroes in on fear of commitment as a pathology and battles it.&quot; He particularly praised the album&#x27;s introspective second half in his consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, saying that it showed Springsteen&#x27;s decency and ability for self-examination. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Steve Pond said that &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; is &quot;a varied, modestly scaled, modern-sounding pop album&quot; rather than a rock and roll album and felt that its unromantic tales of love are similar to Springsteen&#x27;s socially conscious work about broken promises and dreams in America:

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; finished second in the voting for the year&#x27;s best album. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, named it the third best album of the year in his own list. In 1989, the album was ranked #25 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot; while in 2012, the same magazine ranked it at #467 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; the 91st greatest album of all time.

Writing for &quot;America Magazine&quot;, Catholic priest and sociologist Andrew Greeley argued that this album exemplifies the American Catholic imagination. In a 2014 article for &quot;Grantland&quot;, Steven Hyden said &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; remained Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;most underrated record&quot; among fans but in his own opinion, Springsteen&#x27;s best lyrically. &quot;You really shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to hear this record until you&#x27;ve been married for a few years&quot;, Hyden wrote, &quot;though at that point it might strike a little too close to home. If Ingmar Bergman had been born in Freehold and cut his artistic teeth at the Stone Pony, he would&#x27;ve made this record in place of &quot;Scenes From a Marriage&quot;. Totally &#x27;80s production aside ... this album represents the heaviest blues of Springsteen&#x27;s career. The songs are about men and women who flirt, have sex, fall in love, get married, get bored, have sex with other people, and wind up stuck in the middle of that dark night from the second disc of &quot;The River&quot;.&quot;

== Track listing ==

=== Unreleased outtakes ===
While more than 80 songs were said to have been recorded for Springsteen&#x27;s previous album, only 19 are known to have been recorded for &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, with 12 making the album&#x27;s final cut. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; and &quot;Two For the Road&quot; were released as B-sides, and later on &quot;Tracks&quot; along with other outtakes such as &quot;The Honeymooners,&quot; &quot;The Wish&quot; and &quot;When You Need Me.&quot; &quot;Part Man, Part Monkey&quot; was also recorded during these sessions and played live on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour. Although that version remains unreleased, it would be re-recorded during future album sessions and eventually released. &quot;Walking Through Midnight,&quot; the only other unreleased song, was co-written by Southside Johnny who recorded the song for his own album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Slow Dance&quot;.

<doc id="538197" wikidata="Q2321200" url="?curid=538197" title="Leeds City F.C.">
<text>Leeds City Football Club was the leading professional club in Leeds, England, before the First World War. The club was highly successful in the wartime football league; however, it faced sanction for paying its players during wartime which had been made illegal. The club was dissolved in 1919 after the club&#x27;s directors failed to co-operate with the subsequent FA inquiry. In 1919 Leeds United was established as a replacement.

==History==
The club was established in 1904, taking the coat of arms of Leeds as the club badge and adopting blue, yellow and white as the club&#x27;s colours. They were elected to the Football League in 1905. The original secretary, a role that then also carried the modern responsibilities of manager and coach, was Gilbert Gillies (1904–1908) who was followed by Frank Scott-Walford. In 1912, they appointed Herbert Chapman who guided the club to their highest position in the league (4th in the Second Division).

Leeds City&#x27;s entire league career was in the Second Division. However, during the First World War the club won several wartime honours under the stewardship of Herbert Chapman. Following the conclusion of the war a scandal ensued and the club was accused of financial irregularities, including breaking the ban on paying players during the war, that led to the club&#x27;s dissolution in 1919. They were expelled from The Football League eight games into the 1919–20 season. The harsh punishment was handed down mostly because of the behaviour of the club&#x27;s directors, who refused to co-operate in an FA inquiry, and refused to hand over the club&#x27;s financial records.

Port Vale took over their remaining fixtures (as well as their results up to that point). Leeds City were the first club to be expelled from the League mid-season, and one of only two to be expelled from the League due to financial irregularities, with Bury expelled a century later in 2019. Ironically, Leeds City&#x27;s successors, Port Vale, nearly lost their League status for similar reasons in 1968, although they ultimately managed to retain it in an end-of-season vote among the other clubs.
On 17 October 1919, an auction was held at the Metropole Hotel in Leeds, where the playing staff was auctioned off along with other assets of the club. The 16 members of the playing squad were bought by nine clubs for a total of £9,250:

In the wake of its demise, Leeds United was formed, and entered the Football League the following year. None of the players auctioned ever played for the new Leeds United, but winger Ivan Sharpe, who had scored 17 goals in 65 appearances for City between 1913 and 1915, spent 2½ years at United between 1920 and 1923 only making one appearance and right-half Harry Sherwin, who left City just five months before its dissolution, went on to score twice in 107 games for United between 1921 and 1925.

===Subsequent clubs===
A second Leeds City was established in 1924 as an amateur club and joined the Yorkshire League. That club folded after leaving the league at the end of the 1926–27 season.

Another Leeds City was formed in 2006 and joined Division Two of the West Yorkshire League. They were Division Two runners-up in their first season, earning promotion to Division One. The following season saw them finish as runners-up in Division One, resulting in promotion to the Premier Division. As of 2024, they are competing in Division One of The West Yorkshire League.

==Ground==
Having originally played at the Wellington Ground, the club moved into Elland Road after Holbeck Rugby Club folded in October 1904. In their first season in the Football League their average attendance was 10,025, the third highest in the Second Division. Their best season, 1913–14, saw them average 15,845.

<text>Florida Street () is a popular shopping street in Downtown Buenos Aires, Argentina. A pedestrian street since 1971, some stretches have been pedestrianized since 1913.

The pedestrian section as such starts at the intersection of Perú Street and Avenida de Mayo, a block north of the Plaza de Mayo; Perú Street crosses Rivadavia Avenue, and becomes Florida Street. Florida Street runs northwards for approximately one kilometer to Plaza San Martín, in the Retiro area. It intersects Buenos Aires&#x27;s other pedestrian street, Lavalle, at the heart of the former cinema district.

Florida is one of the city&#x27;s leading tourist attractions. Florida Street bustles with shoppers, vendors, and office workers alike because of its proximity to the financial district. By evening, the pace relaxes as street performers flock to the area, including tango singers and dancers, living statues, and comedy acts. Its variety of retail stores, shopping arcades, and restaurants is of great interest to foreign tourists and business travelers.

==History==


The beginnings of Florida Street date back to the founding of Buenos Aires in 1580, when it was hewn as a primitive path uphill from the banks of the . Its first official name was &quot;San José,&quot; enacted by Governor Miguel de Salcedo in 1734. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the street was known popularly as &quot;Calle del Correo&quot; (Post Street) in reference to the post office located on what later became Perú Street (the southern continuation of Florida Street). It was also later known as &quot;Empedrado&quot; (Cobbled Street). Improved with boulders brought from Montevideo beginning in 1789, it became the first paved street in the city (a section of the original cobblestone pavement is displayed behind the entrance to the Cathedral Station on Diagonal Norte Avenue). Following the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1808, the street was called Baltasar Unquera, in homage to an aide-de-camp to Viceroy Santiago de Liniers, fallen in the fight against Admiral William Carr Beresford. The street was first named &quot;Florida&quot; in 1821. The name was designated in honor of the battle fought in 1814 in Upper Peru against the royalists during the Argentine War of Independence. Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas renamed the street &quot;Perú&quot; in 1837, and in 1857, the name was returned to the present one.

The Argentine National Anthem was first performed in 1813 at the Florida Street home of Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, one of the city&#x27;s most prominent citizens. Argentine elites began to leave the central and southern wards of the city mainly due to epidemics, especially the 1871 yellow fever outbreak. They decided to move to higher ground in the city and chose the area known as Retiro. Florida Street, whose northern half is in the Retiro ward, became a shopping street in 1872, and would soon welcome pharmacies, furniture retailers, jewelers, and haberdasheries that offered the latest in European fashion. Numerous private mansions were also built along Florida Street in the 1880s and 1890s. The Parisian-inspired Bon Marché became the street&#x27;s first large-scale shopping arcade in 1889, and the Argentine Jockey Club, the nation&#x27;s most prestigious gentlemen&#x27;s club and horse racing society, was inaugurated in 1897.

The Civic Youth Union, was organized in 1889 at the intersection with the Avenida Córdoba. This organization would foment the Revolution of the Park in 1890, and from its ranks the Radical Civic Union (to whom six presidents would later belong during the twentieth century) would be established in 1891.

A tram was installed along Florida Street in the 1890s, and it soon became a leading commercial artery in Buenos Aires. Vehicular traffic was barred during business hours in 1911 by request of the growing number of shop owners along Florida, and in 1913 the tram was dismantled to pedestrianize a section of the street. The 1914 inaugural of the Gath &amp; Chaves department store coincided with the inaugural of Harrods Buenos Aires, the only overseas branch of Harrods, and the illuminated spire topped Galería Güemes. The merger of Gath &amp; Chaves and Harrods in 1922 created two of the most ornate institutions of their kind in the Americas. Florida Street also became the address for a number of important corporate headquarters during the 1920s, including BankBoston Argentina and &quot;La Nación&quot;, the nation&#x27;s leading news daily at the time. Lavalle Street, which intersects Florida, became a focal point of local cinema houses beginning in the 1930s.

The city&#x27;s middle and upper classes would later relocate further north, to Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano, however. This trend was reinforced by the 1953 arson of the grand Jockey Club building by a Peronist mob. Its decline, however, was slowed by both an era of relative prosperity in Argentina, as well as milestones such as the inaugural of the Hotel Claridge in 1946, the Torcuato di Tella Institute&#x27;s Florida Street center in 1963 (which became a hub of Buenos Aires&#x27; avant-garde and pop art scene during the 1960s), and the 1971 conversion of the street into a promenade. Writer Jorge Luis Borges lived near the northern end, and was fond of taking walks through the semi-deserted street in the pre-dawn hours. Borges was an outspoken critic of the renovation work done on the street in 1970; he was blind, and the new arrangement of trash cans, planters, flower pots, and magazine stands was a serious accessibility risk for him. He was also influenced by his esthetic-minded friends, who saw the new scheme as a break with tradition.

The economic crisis of the 1980s precluded any recovery, however. Nor did the street benefit from a consumer boom during the 1990s, as this was largely diverted toward a series of new shopping malls opened in the city&#x27;s north side. Galerías Pacífico was renovated and reopened in 1991, though Harrods Buenos Aires, which by then operated only on the ground floor, would close in 1998. Mayor Fernando de la Rúa had the textured concrete pavers along Florida replaced in 1999 with granite tiles laid in a decorative black-and-white pattern.

Commerce along the street was afflicted in the ensuing years by proliferating street vendors, a result of a legal loophole in the municipal ordinance that otherwise prohibits the practice; Mayor Mauricio Macri succeeded in having these vendors removed in January 2012. Florida Street continues to command among the highest commercial rents in the city, and has become a favorite attraction among the city&#x27;s growing number of foreign tourists.

==Highlights==

===Rivadavia Avenue to Perón Street===
Florida Street begins at its southern end on Rivadavia Avenue. The first block, made somewhat wider than the remainder of the promenade by a city ordinance, is overlooked by the Mappin &amp; Webb House (1911) and the post-modern former headquarters of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in Argentina (1989); both became branches of HSBC upon BNL&#x27;s departure in 2006.

One of the most iconic locations in Buenos Aires is the intersections of Florida Street and Diagonal Norte Avenue, built between 1913 and 1943. Two of the avenue&#x27;s most distinguishable buildings are located at this intersection: the Plateresque BankBoston Building (1924), the Art Deco La Equitativa del Plata (1929), and two cupola-topped Bencich Buildings (1927). The intersection forms a triangular plaza adorned with José Fioravanti&#x27;s monument to President Roque Sáenz Peña (1937).

Two important shopping arcades are located on the 100 block: Galerías Boston and the landmark Galería Güemes, designed by Francisco Gianotti and opened in 1914; distinguishable by the illuminated beacon atop its spire, it was one of the tallest buildings in Buenos Aires st the time. The former Gath &amp; Chaves department store (1914) and annex (overlooking Avenida de Mayo) were located here until the retailer&#x27;s closure in 1974; the buildings today house Banco Meridian, the local branch of Deloitte, as well as Chilean retailer Falabella.

===Perón Street to Lavalle Street===
The 200 block features the former Grand Florida Cinema (1925), created in an eclectic Art Deco design by Jorge Kálnay. The corner of Perón Street is overlooked by the Plateresque former Banco Popular Argentino (1931), today the headquarters of HSBC Bank Argentina. The corner of Sarmiento Street is the site of the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires headquarters since 1968, located in a building originally opened in 1908 as the Mexico City Store.

The 300 block includes the oldest existing bookstore of El Ateneo chain (one of two on Florida Street); founded in 1912, the booksellers opened their first Florida Street store in 1936. Facing El Ateneo is the former headquarters of &quot;La Nación&quot; newspaper. One of numerous Plateresque office buildings completed in the area during the 1920s, the building, known today as the Mitre Gallery, is the second store opened on Florida Street by Falabella. The corner of the intersection with Avenida Corrientes is overlooked by office high-rises, a Stock Center sporting goods megastore, and, for contrast, the former Elortondo Alvear residence (1880); the neo-Gothic mansion was converted into a Burger King in the 1990s.

The Julio Peña residence (1917), today the headquarters of the Argentine Rural Society, is one of the few private residences surviving from the time luxurious homes shared Florida Street with commercial establishments. Opened the same year, the Richmond Café next door was a favorite coffee house among local upscale patrons; Jorge Luis Borges, Graham Greene, and the Florida group of avant-garde writers were among the many literati who gathered there. The Richmond closed amid controversy in 2011. The 400 block ends at the intersection with Lavalle Street, and is overlooked by both curtain walled office mid-rises and French architecture. Lavalle Street, from the 1930s until the 1990s, rivaled Corrientes Avenue for the number of movie theaters along its downtown stretch; most have since closed, however, and Lavalle, which was pedestrianized in 1978, became largely a shopping street. The large numbers of pedestrians at the intersection between the two also made the intersection a forum for performances by street artists.

===Lavalle Street to Córdoba Avenue===
The 500 block was the site of the Jockey Club, designed by Manuel Turner and completed in 1897. Founded in 1882 by future President Carlos Pellegrini, the institution governed horse racing in Argentina, and built the Palermo and San Isidro racecourses. An incident on April 15, 1953, in which bombs were detonated at the Plaza de Mayo during one of President Juan Perón&#x27;s many rallies, resulted in the destruction of the Beaux-Arts landmark by enraged Peronists, who viewed the aristocratic Jockey Club as a center of anti-Peronism. The lot lay empty until the construction of Galería Jardín (1976), an office and retail complex designed by Mario Roberto Álvarez in a belated International Style. The complex includes several levels of shops, a basement for offices and two high-rise towers, one of which is residential. Its retail section is known for its selection of consumer electronics and computer equipment.

An Art Deco office building on the northwest corner of Tucumán Street and the neo-classical Cadellada Building highlight the 600 block; a second El Ateneo bookshop, a third Falabella store, and the modern Galería Arax (site of the Buenos Aires Auditorium) are also located there.

The renowned Galerías Pacífico shopping arcade occupies nearly the entire block along the eastern side of the 700 block. The monumental building, designed by Roland le Vacher in 1888 to house the &quot;Au Bon Marché&quot; shops, also housed the National Museum of Fine Arts from 1896 to 1910, and thereafter the head office of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway; restored in 1991, its grand interiors also feature ceiling frescoes by Antonio Berni, Juan Carlos Castagnino, and other famed Argentine painters.

===Córdoba Avenue to Plaza San Martín===
The junction with Córdoba Avenue marks the street&#x27;s entry into the Retiro ward. The northeast corner is distinguished by the magnificent Naval Center (1914), designed by Jacques Dunant and Gastón Mallet in a Beaux-Arts style. Separated from the Naval Center by Galería Buenos Aires is the former Harrods Buenos Aires, completed in 1920. Following a lengthy legal struggle with the then-owner of the Harrods on Knightsbridge, Mohamed Al-Fayed, the department store closed in 1998, and since functions intermittently as a venue for cultural events, notably the Buenos Aires Tango Festival. The current owners, Swiss equity firm CBC Interconfianz, filed permits to restore Harrods Buenos Aires in 2009. The modern Galería del Sol faces the former Harrods. Galería Florida (1964), a curtain-walled high rise designed by Álvarez for Air France, stands on the southwest corner with Paraguay Street, and the Florida Garden Café, opened in 1962 in a belle époque building, is on the southeast.

The Cultural Center of Spain in Buenos Aires (CCEB) is located on the 900 block. This block, however, is best known locally as the erstwhile site of the Torcuato di Tella Institute. Located on Florida Street during its heyday between 1963 and 1970, the institute was led at the time by former National Fine Arts Museum director Jorge Romero Brest, who steered the center as the leading Argentine venue for pop art, experimental theatre, and conceptual art, drawing artists such as León Ferrari, Gyula Kosice, Luis Felipe Noé, and Antonio Seguí. Romero Brest also promoted the center&#x27;s famed Happenings, notably those of Marta Minujín, whose interactive displays and mazes helped make this block of Florida Street Buenos Aires&#x27; &quot;mazana loca&quot; (city block of madness).

The street continues into the Juvenilia Esplanade, centered around a memorial to writer Esteban Echeverría, and overlooked by a French-inspired apartment building designed by Alejandro Bustillo. The Ruth Benzacar Gallery, another leading promoter of local avant-garde art, opened in 1965 and is also located here. Facing the esplanade is Plaza San Martín, designed by the noted urbanist Charles Thays in 1889. Upscale Santa Fe Avenue merges into Florida Street along the Plaza Hotel, designed by Adolf Zucker for local banker Ernesto Tornquist and inaugurated in 1909.

Florida Street becomes San Martín Street one block south of Avenida del Libertador, and beside the best known of Buenos Aires&#x27; Art Deco landmarks, the Kavanagh Building. Overlooking Plaza San Martín, the 120 m (390 ft) apartment building was designed in 1934 by the firm of Sánchez, Lagos and de la Tour for Corina Kavanagh. Local lore has it that the wealthy Irish Argentine heiress planned the high-rise as a revenge against the Anchorena family, and made but one demand of the architects: that views of the Anchorenas&#x27; Church of the Holy Sacrament from their residence, the San Martín Palace, be blocked.

==Transportation==
The preferable means of transportation to reach Florida Street from almost anywhere in the city, is the Buenos Aires Metro (&quot;subte&quot;, or underground). Five metro lines have stations within a short walking distance of Florida. Most bus lines reaching the downtown area have stops near Florida Street, as well.

 Florida Station

 Catedral Station

The Retiro transportation hub, which maintains a terminal for long-distance buses and a railway station for three major lines, is located near the northern end of Florida, across Avenida del Libertador. Line C of the metro provides access to both Retiro and Constitución Stations.

<text>Saccard is a fictional character created by Émile Zola in his 20-novel cycle Les Rougon-Macquart. Saccard (a pseudonym of the character Aristide Rougon) is the central figure in the novels &quot;La Curée&quot; (1872) and &quot;L&#x27;Argent&quot; (1891), and features in a number of other books in the cycle. A ruthless and greedy financier, his name is still used in France as a byword for corporate or plutocratic figures driven by lust for money.

<doc id="538206" wikidata="Q1108221" url="?curid=538206" title="Cartoon physics">
<text>Cartoon physics or animation physics are terms for a jocular system of laws of physics (and biology) that supersedes the normal laws, used in animation for humorous effect.

Many of the most famous American animated films, particularly those from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, indirectly developed a relatively consistent set of such &quot;laws&quot; which have become &quot;de rigueur&quot; in comic animation. They usually involve things behaving in accordance with how they appear to the cartoon characters, or what the characters expect, rather than how they objectively are. In one common example, when a cartoon character runs off a cliff, gravity has no effect until the character notices there&#x27;s nothing under their feet.

In words attributed to Art Babbitt, an animator with the Walt Disney Studios, &quot;Animation follows the laws of physics—unless it is funnier otherwise.&quot;

== Examples ==
Specific reference to &quot;cartoon physics&quot; extends back at least to June 1980, when an article &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Laws of Cartoon Motion&quot; appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot;. A version printed in V.18 No. 7 p. 12, 1994 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in its journal helped spread the word among the technical crowd, which has expanded and refined the idea.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s examples include: 
*Any body suspended in space will remain suspended in space until made aware of its situation. A character steps off a cliff but remains in midair until looking down, then the familiar principle of 16 feet per second squared takes over.
*A body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation conforming to its perimeter called the silhouette of passage.
*The time required for an object to fall 20 stories is greater than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to spiral down 20 flights to attempt to capture it unbroken. Such an object is inevitably priceless; the attempt to capture it, inevitably unsuccessful.
*All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
*Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel them directly away from the ground. A spooky noise or an adversary&#x27;s signature sound will introduce motion upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop or the crest of a flagpole.
*The feet of a running character or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch the ground, ergo fleeing turns to flight.
*As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.

*Certain bodies can pass through a solid wall painted to resemble tunnel entrances; others cannot. ... Whoever paints an entrance on a wall&#x27;s surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical space. The painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting. This is ultimately a problem of art, not science.
*Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent. Cartoon cats can be sliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled or disassembled, but they cannot be destroyed. After a few moments of blinking self-pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back or solidify. 
== History of the idea ==
The idea that cartoons behave differently from the real world, but not randomly, is virtually as old as animation. Walt Disney, for example, spoke of the plausible impossible in 1956 on an episode of the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television program.

Warner Brothers&#x27; Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series had numerous examples of their own cartoon physics (such as in the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons) or even acknowledged they ignore real world physics. In &quot;High Diving Hare&quot; (1948), when Yosemite Sam cuts through a high diving board Bugs Bunny is standing on, the ladder and platform that Sam is on falls, leaving the cut plank suspended in mid-air. Bugs turns to the camera and cracks: &quot;I know this defies the law of gravity, but, you see, I never studied law!&quot;

After being seen on the big screen, cartoon physics was soon taken down to the small screen through many shows from Hanna-Barbera, where Yogi Bear and Boo Boo and the rest of the anthropomorphic animals used it many times.

The animated television series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; had an episode dedicated to it &quot;Toon Physics&quot;, in which Orson Whales teaches how it differs from actual science. 

More recently, it has been explicitly described by some cartoon characters, including Roger Rabbit, Bonkers D. Bobcat, and Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, who say that toons are allowed to bend or break natural laws for the purposes of comedy. Doing this is extremely tricky, so toons have a natural sense of comedic timing, giving them inherently funny properties. In &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, for example, Roger is unable to escape handcuffs for most of a sequence, doing so only to use both hands to hold the table still while Eddie Valiant attempts to saw the cuffs off. When Eddie asks, exasperated, &quot;Do you mean to tell me you could&#x27;ve taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?!&quot; Roger responds: &quot;Not at &quot;any&quot; time! Only when it was &quot;funny&quot;!&quot; Several aspects of cartoon physics were discussed in the film&#x27;s dialogue, and the concept was a minor plot theme.

In 1993, Stephen R. Gould, then a financial training consultant, wrote in &quot;New Scientist&quot;, said that &quot;... these seemingly nonsensical phenomena can be described by logical laws similar to those in our world. Nonsensical events are by no means limited to the Looniverse. Laws that govern our own Universe often seem contrary to common sense.&quot; This theme is also described by Alan Cholodenko in his article, &quot;The Nutty Universe of Animation&quot;.

In a Garfield animated short entitled &quot;Secrets of the Animated Cartoon&quot;, the characters Orson and Wade give demonstrations of different laws of the cartoons and show humorous examples of them.

In 2012 O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Laws of Cartoon Motion were used as the basis for a presentation and exhibition by Andy Holden at Kingston University in Great Britain. Titled &#x27;Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape&#x27;, it explored ideas of cartoon physics in relation to art and the end of art history. This was later made into a film with the artist as an animated cartoon character and shown at Glasgow International Festival in 2016, Tate Britain in 2017, and Future Generation Art Prize at Venice Biennale in 2017.

== Non-exclusivity ==
Cartoon physics is not limited to physics. For example, when a character recovers impossibly fast from a serious injury, the laws of biology rather than physics are being altered.

It is also not limited to cartoons; in live-action, the physics-defying stunts would fall under the umbrella of slapstick. Live-action shows and movies can also be subject to the laws of cartoon physics, explaining why, for example, The Three Stooges did not go blind from all the eye-poking, and the burglars in the &quot;Home Alone&quot; series survive life-threatening booby traps. In the live-action &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977), the titular dragon Elliot, while invisible, bursts through a wooden wall, leaving a dragon-shaped &quot;silhouette of passage&quot;. The Ernest P. Worrell film series often made note of the title character&#x27;s cartoon-like traits, with Ernest himself remarking in &quot;Ernest Rides Again&quot; that he would be dead &quot;if I wasn&#x27;t this close to being an actual cartoon.&quot;

In a review of one of the &quot;Home Alone&quot; films, film critic Roger Ebert noted that in the case of live-action productions, cartoon physics are not as effective at producing a comic effect, as the effects seem more realistic:

Printed cartoons have their own family of cartoon physics &quot;laws&quot; and conventions. Additionally, some video games utilize these elements during their cutscenes. For example, in the game &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;, titular character Sonic the Hedgehog is seen making effective use of hammerspace to stash a Chaos Emerald.

The concept can be used as a metaphor outside video. In an editorial for the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2003 titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;, for example, economist Paul Krugman wrote while describing a gap between revenue and spending, &quot;The crisis won&#x27;t come immediately. For a few years, America will still be able to borrow freely, simply because lenders assume that things will somehow work out... But at a certain point we&#x27;ll have a Wile E. Coyote moment. For those not familiar with the Road Runner cartoons, Mr. Coyote had a habit of running off cliffs and taking several steps on thin air before noticing that there was nothing underneath his feet. Only then would he plunge. What will that plunge look like?&quot;

<text>Vivienne Patricia Scialfa ( ; born July 29, 1953) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. Scialfa has been a member of the E Street Band since 1984 and has been married to Bruce Springsteen since 1991. In 2014, Scialfa was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band.

==Early life and education==
Scialfa grew up in Deal, New Jersey on the Jersey Shore. She was the middle child of Joseph Scialfa and Patricia (née Morris) Scialfa. Her father was of Sicilian ancestry and her mother is from Belfast, Northern Ireland. She also has half-siblings from her father&#x27;s second marriage. Her father was a successful local entrepreneur, who started a television store and became a real estate developer. Scialfa began writing songs at an early age.

===Asbury Park High School===
She attended Asbury Park High School, where she graduated in 1971. Following high school, she first began working as a back-up singer for New Jersey bar bands.

===University of Miami and New York University===
She began college at the University of Miami&#x27;s jazz conservatory at the Frost School of Music, and later transferred to New York University, where she earned an undergraduate degree in music.

In 1994, she told &quot;Lear&#x27;s Magazine&quot; that she had little talent for anything but music and that she attended college as a way to further her ambitions as a performer while also satisfying parental expectations.

==Career==

While in college at the University of Miami and later at New York University, Scialfa began recording original music for other artists. However, none of her songs were recorded.

After her college graduation, she worked as a busker and waitress in Greenwich Village. Together with Soozie Tyrell and Lisa Lowell, she formed a street group known as Trickster. For many years, she struggled to make her way in the songwriting and recording industry in New York City and New Jersey before playing at Folk City and Kenny&#x27;s Castaways in Greenwich Village and The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Scialfa had a brief role in The Stone Pony&#x27;s house band Cats on a Smooth Surface. These gigs won her notice and, eventually, recording work with Southside Johnny and David Johansen.

In 1984, Scialfa joined the E Street Band, three or four days before the opening show of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour. In 1986, she appeared on the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Dirty Work&quot; album, leaving her vocal mark on &quot;One Hit (To the Body)&quot; as well as other tracks. She worked with Keith Richards on his first solo album &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot;. Steve Jordan, who co-produced the Richards record, was a friend of Scialfa&#x27;s from her Greenwich Village days.

Scialfa&#x27;s music industry friendships with Soozie Tyrell and Lisa Lowell are long-standing, pre-dating their mutual work as background vocalists and musicians on the 1987 Buster Poindexter album, featuring a Soca song by Arrow, &quot;Hot Hot Hot&quot;. Lowell and Tyrell have since worked on various Springsteen-Scialfa recording projects and Tyrell, a violinist, has recorded and toured with Springsteen and the E Street Band.

Scialfa has recorded three solo albums, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Rumble Doll&quot;, 2004&#x27;s &quot;23rd Street Lullaby&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Play It As It Lays&quot;. Her first two albums received four-star reviews from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, while the third received three and a half stars. Her records are a mix of confessional songwriting, impressive vocal range, and traditional country, folk and rock music. Springsteen and fellow E Street bandmates, like Nils Lofgren and Roy Bittan, have contributed to her albums. Following the release of Scialfa&#x27;s second album, she played a series of club dates on the East Coast and was the opening act of the post-final night of the Vote for Change tour.

In 2009 and again in 2011, Scialfa confirmed that she had written most of the songs for her fourth album and was trying to find the time to record it.

== Personal life ==
Scialfa first met Bruce Springsteen in the early 1980s at The Stone Pony, a music venue and bar in Asbury Park, New Jersey, where Springsteen and his band regularly played. In 1984, Scialfa postponed recording her solo record to join Springsteen&#x27;s Born in the U.S.A. Tour. After the tour, Scialfa started a short-term relationship with actor Tom Cruise.

In August 1988, Springsteen&#x27;s first wife Julianne Phillips filed for divorce, and Scialfa and Springsteen started living together afterward in New Jersey and later in New York City before relocating to Los Angeles, where they started a family. Springsteen and Phillips&#x27;s divorce was finalized in 1989.

On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, Evan James Springsteen. Scialfa and Springsteen married on June 8, 1991, at their Los Angeles home in a ceremony attended by family and close friends. Their second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born December 30, 1991, and their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born January 5, 1994. The family returned to New Jersey in the early 1990s and now lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey. They also own homes in Wellington, Florida, near West Palm Beach, and Los Angeles.

On July 17, 2022, Scialfa and Springsteen became first time grandparents with the birth of their granddaughter Lily Harper Springsteen, daughter of their son Sam.

In September 2024, Scialfa revealed that she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2018.

<doc id="538240" wikidata="Q7318254" url="?curid=538240" title="Reverse perspective">
<text>Reverse perspective, also called inverse perspective, inverted perspective, divergent perspective, or Byzantine perspective, is a form of perspective drawing where the objects depicted in a scene are placed between the projective point and the viewing plane. Objects further away from the viewing plane are drawn as larger, and closer objects are drawn as smaller, in contrast to the more conventional linear perspective where closer objects appear larger. Lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space are drawn as diverging against the horizon, rather than converging as they do in linear perspective. Technically, the vanishing points are placed outside the painting with the illusion that they are &quot;in front of&quot; the painting. 

The name Byzantine perspective comes from the use of this perspective in Byzantine and Russian Orthodox icons; it is also found in the art of many pre-Renaissance cultures, and was sometimes used in Cubism and other movements of modern art, as well as in children&#x27;s drawings. The reasons for the convention are still debated among art historians; since the artists involved in forming the convention did not have access to the more realistic linear perspective convention, it is not clear how deliberate the effects achieved were.

<text>Alexander Louis Teixeira de Mattos (9 April 1865 – 5 December 1921), known as Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, was a Dutch-English journalist, literary critic and publisher, who gained his greatest fame as a translator.

==Early life==
The Teixeira de Mattos Sampaio e Mendes family was of Portuguese Jewish origin, having been driven out of Portugal to the Netherlands by Holy Office persecution. Alexander Teixeira de Mattos was born as a Dutch Protestant to an English mother and a Dutch father. In 1874, when he was nine years old, he and his family moved from Amsterdam to England. There, he studied under Monsignor Thomas John Capel and converted to Roman Catholicism. He then studied at the Kensington Catholic Public School and at the Jesuit school Beaumont College.

==Career==
After his studies, Teixeira came into contact with J. T. Grein, a London impresario of Dutch origin, and was made secretary of Grein&#x27;s Independent Theatre Society. He worked as a freelance translator, as the London correspondent of a Dutch newspaper, and as the editor of the papers &quot;Dramatic Opinions&quot; and &quot;The Candid Friend&quot;, and, in collaboration with Leonard Smithers, in publishing. He became the official translator of the works of Maurice Maeterlinck, beginning with Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Double Garden&quot;.

Teixera was fluent in English, French, German, Flemish, Dutch, and Danish. In addition to the later works of Maeterlinck, his translations include works by Émile Zola, Alexis de Tocqueville, Maurice Leblanc, Gaston Leroux, François René de Chateaubriand, Paul Kruger, Carl Ewald, Georgette Leblanc, Stijn Streuvels, and Louis Couperus. He considered his greatest achievement to be his complete translation of Jean-Henri Fabre&#x27;s natural history.

In the 1890s, Teixeira was the leading translator for the Lutetian Society, a group whose mission was &quot;to issue to its members, translations of such representative master-pieces of fiction by Continental authors as are unprocurable in English in an unmutilated rendering.&quot; He oversaw the Society&#x27;s publication of unexpurgated translations of six banned novels by Émile Zola in 1894–5, contributing his own translation of the third volume in the series, &quot;La curée&quot;.

During World War I, Teixera was head of the Intelligence Section, as well as a member of the Advisory Board, of the War Trade Intelligence Department. Midway through the war, Teixeira became a British subject. In June 1920, he was made a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold II.

==Personal life==
On 20 October 1900, he married Lily Wilde, née Sophie Lily Lees (1859-1922), the widow of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s older brother Willie Wilde and thus became the stepfather of Dolly Wilde, then age 5. Alexander and Lily Teixeira de Mattos had one son, who died a few hours after birth.

Teixeira was known to his acquaintances as a dandy and a fastidious worker, keeping strictly to set hours, and was linked to the Symbolist movement thanks to his friendship and travels with Arthur Symons. He was also personal friends with Maurice Maeterlinck and Louis Couperus, both of whom wrote works he translated. He was politically liberal and a devout Catholic.

Due to ill health, Teixeira traveled on a rest cure in 1920 at Crowborough and the Isle of Wight, returning to his home in Chelsea, London in spring 1921. He worked as usual through the autumn and traveled to Cornwall for the winter. On 5 December 1921, in St Ives, Cornwall he collapsed and died from angina pectoris. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its obituary notice, called him &quot;one of the best translators of foreign languages of the present generation.&quot; The high quality and readability of Teixera&#x27;s work was such that many of his translations are still in print today. For example, though his translation of &quot;La curée&quot; is over a century old, its accuracy and style have given it a status still unrivaled by more modern versions.

<doc id="538261" wikidata="Q1501126" url="?curid=538261" title="Kuiper Airborne Observatory">
<text>The Gerard P. Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) was a national facility operated by NASA to support research in infrared astronomy. The observation platform was a highly modified Lockheed C-141A Starlifter jet transport aircraft (s/n: 6110, registration: N714NA, callsign: NASA 714) with a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km), capable of conducting research operations at altitudes of up to 48,000 feet (14 km).

==Aircraft==

The KAO was based at the Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, near Sunnyvale, California. Prior to its conversion to the airborne observatory, it had served as Lockheed&#x27;s demonstrator for a potential civilian version of the C-141.

Though it began operation in 1974 as a replacement for an earlier aircraft, the Galileo Observatory (itself a converted Convair 990 (N711NA) that was destroyed in a collision with a U.S. Navy Lockheed P-3C Orion patrol aircraft in 1973), the KAO wasn&#x27;t dedicated until May 21, 1975. The KAO flew at altitudes of 41,000 to 45,000 feet, and flew a total of 1,417 times.

The KAO has a 160-foot wingspan, measures 145 feet long, and stands 39 feet high. A typical crew consisted of two pilots, a flight engineer, the mission staff, and the flight team, and the aircraft provided a stable platform for missions lasting up to seven and a half hours. The KAO flew mostly out of Moffett Field, but also flew out of New Zealand, Australia, American Samoa, Panama, Japan, Guam, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Houston (Texas), and Hawaii.

During a flight in 1978 that took off from American Samoa, two of the observatory&#x27;s four engines failed soon after takeoff, and after the aircraft staggered and instrument power was shut down, the flight engineer had to crank down the landing gear manually.

==Telescope==

The KAO&#x27;s telescope was a conventional Cassegrain reflector with a 36-inch (91.5 cm) aperture, designed primarily for observations in the 1 to 500 μm spectral range. Its flight capability allowed it to rise above almost all of the water vapor in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (allowing observations of infrared radiation, which is blocked before reaching ground-based facilities), as well as travel to almost any point on the Earth&#x27;s surface for an observation.

==History==
The observatory was named in honor of planetary scientist Gerard P. Kuiper, who participated in expeditions on NASA&#x27;s Galileo Airborne Observatory.

The KAO made several major discoveries, including the first sightings of the rings of Uranus in 1977 and a definitive identification of an atmosphere on Pluto in 1988. The KAO was used to study the origin and distribution of water and organic molecules in regions of star formation, and in the vast spaces between the stars. Kuiper astronomers also studied the disks surrounding certain stars that may be related to the formation of planetary systems around these stars. It took infrared spectrum measurements of the planet Mercury in 1995. No quartz or olivine in Mercury&#x27;s surface rocks was detected.

Peering still deeper into space, KAO astronomers studied powerful far-infrared emissions from the center of our galaxy and other galaxies. Scientists on board the KAO tracked the formation of heavy elements like iron, nickel, and cobalt from the massive fusion reactions of supernova SN 1987A.


The KAO was retired in 1995 and is viewable at Moffett Field, although it is no longer airworthy. It has been succeeded by a Boeing 747-based airborne observatory equipped with a larger aperture telescope, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA completed its first test flight on April 26, 2007 and its telescope saw first light on May 26, 2010. Initial &quot;routine&quot; science observation flights began in December 2010 and the observatory was at full capability with about 100 flights per year. Eventually, SOFIA was retired, with its last flight on September 30, 2022.

<doc id="538262" wikidata="Q313784" url="?curid=538262" title="Herbert Chapman">
<text>Herbert Chapman (19 January 1878 – 6 January 1934) was an English football player and manager. Though he had an undistinguished playing career, he went on to become one of the most influential and successful managers in the early 20th century, before his sudden death in 1934. He is regarded as one of the game&#x27;s greatest innovators.

As a player, Chapman played for a variety of clubs, at Football League and non-League levels. His record was generally unremarkable as a player; he made fewer than 40 League appearances over the course of a decade and did not win any major honours. Instead, he found success as a manager, first at Northampton Town between 1908 and 1912, which he led to a Southern League title. This attracted the attention of larger clubs and he moved to Leeds City, where he started to improve the team&#x27;s fortunes before the First World War intervened. After the war ended, City were implicated in an illegal payments scandal and were eventually disbanded. Chapman was initially banned from football but successfully appealed. He took over at Huddersfield Town, winning an FA Cup and two First Division titles in the period of four years.

In 1925, Arsenal successfully tempted Chapman to join them, and he led the club to its first ever silverware by winning one FA Cup and two First Division titles. His work at Arsenal resulted in their becoming the dominant team of the 1930s – they won five League titles and two FA Cups in the decade before the suspension of football due to the outbreak of the Second World War – but he did not live to see the entirety of his team&#x27;s success, dying suddenly from pneumonia in 1934, at the age of 55.

He is credited with improving Arsenal. He introduced new tactics (the WM formation, which forms the core of most modern-day formations) and training techniques to the game and the use of physiotherapists. He led the team, rather than letting board members lead. He also used floodlighting and numbered shirts, entered European club competitions, and has received many posthumous honours in recognition.

==Early life==
Chapman was born in Kiveton Park, near Rotherham on 19 January 1878. His father, John, was a coal miner, but rather than spend his own life working down the pit, the young Herbert was bright enough to win a place at Sheffield Technical College (later to become part of the University of Sheffield), where he studied mining engineering.

Chapman was one of eleven children and was born into a keen sporting family, with two of his brothers also playing professional football. The most successful of these was his younger brother Harry, who played for The Wednesday during the 1900s, winning two League Championships and an FA Cup. His elder brother Thomas played for Grimsby Town, while another brother, Matthew, later became a director of the same club.

==Playing career==
Chapman&#x27;s playing career was that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a particular club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, winning the Hatchard Cup in 1894 alongside team-mate William Ross. He left the village that summer to join Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not to be confused with the modern-day Rochdale) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry Chapman, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.

In 1898, he moved to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the professional Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained a job with a firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were near the bottom of the division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United&#x27;s top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.

Because of his studies, he mainly played for Worksop&#x27;s reserves, but in a first-team match against Northampton Town he caught the opposition&#x27;s eye and they offered him a contract, leading him to turn professional for the first time in 1901. He played for Northampton for the whole 1901–02 season, finishing as top scorer with 14 goals in 22 games for the club. During that season he had impressed in an FA Cup match against Sheffield United, leading them to offer Chapman a contract at the end of the season; Chapman accepted but dropped down to amateur status, wishing to make use of his engineering qualifications in the local area. He played 22 matches and scored twice for United, but struggled to keep his place in a team full of internationals, and was sold to Notts County for £300 at the end of 1902–03. Chapman turned professional again, but only made seven appearances in two years for County, scoring once.

In 1904, Chapman moved back to his old club Northampton Town, playing a season effectively on loan from Notts County (as they kept his registration), before being transferred permanently in 1905 to Tottenham Hotspur for £70. He scored eleven goals for Spurs in their 1905–06 Southern League campaign. He spent 1906–07 in and out of the side, scoring just three goals. With the season drawing to a close, he decided that he had had &quot;a good innings&quot; and decided to leave Tottenham and professional football for good, in favour of pursuing his career in engineering.

==Managerial career==
===Northampton Town===
In 1907, as he was about to leave Tottenham Hotspur, Chapman had recommended Spurs team-mate Walter Bull to his old club Northampton Town, as their new manager. However, Bull changed his mind, and in turn recommended that Chapman take the job instead. Chapman changed his mind about retiring from the game, and instead agreed to become player-manager of Northampton Town. Northampton had finished bottom of the Southern League two seasons running immediately before Chapman&#x27;s appointment, but Chapman turned the club around within a short period of time.

At the time, teams rarely employed tactics of any sort – Chapman would later remark: &quot;No attempt was made to organise victory. The most that I remember was the occasional chat between, say two men playing on the same wing.&quot; As a manager, he sought to change that; after seeing Northampton lose to Norwich City despite dominating, Chapman opined that &quot;a team can attack for too long&quot;. He thus set about creating a tactical framework for all his players; he dropped the half backs (midfield) back to give his forwards more space and draw the opposition defenders out of the penalty area, while encouraging his own back line to pass their way out of trouble. Gradually, he created a style of highly organised, counter-attacking football, which was at odds with the prevailing orthodoxy but nevertheless highly effective; Swindon Town&#x27;s England international Harold Fleming, after losing 4–1 at home to Northampton, remarked to Chapman: &quot;You have something more than a team: you have a machine.&quot;

To allow his system to reach its full potential, Chapman encouraged his chairman to spend money on new players. The club&#x27;s first ever transfer fee, £400, was paid for Welsh international Lloyd Davies who remains Northampton&#x27;s most capped player, winger Fred McDiarmid and playmaking centre half David McCartney. With this new talent, in his first season in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this as a springboard to take the Southern League title in 1908–09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.

By now, Chapman had retired as a player in first-class football, having played his last match against Watford in January 1909, but filled the gap he left, as well as showing his eye for spotting talent, by signing players such as future England international Fanny Walden. As Southern League champions, Northampton contested and lost the 1909 FA Charity Shield, 2–0 to Newcastle United, and although they did not win the Southern League title again during Chapman&#x27;s time as manager, they finished in the top four in each of the following three seasons. Additionally, they proved their mettle in the FA Cup against First Division sides, knocking out The Wednesday and taking Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United to replays, losing 1–0 both times.

Chapman was keen to get Northampton Town into the Football League, but with no automatic promotion or relegation rules at the time this proved very difficult. Chapman proposed a new two-division Football Alliance underneath the two divisions of the Football League, with automatic promotion and relegation (a similar system to the four-division League setup introduced in 1921), but this was rejected at the time (and would not come about until 1920). In the 1912 close season, he was offered the chance to manage Second Division Leeds City, and with Northampton&#x27;s blessing moved north again to join the League club.

===Leeds City===

Leeds City had finished 19th in the Second Division in the season preceding Chapman&#x27;s arrival, and were facing re-election. Chapman played an essential part in lobbying for the side&#x27;s readmission and Leeds City were duly re-elected. That done, Chapman signed new talent such as Jimmy Speirs from Bradford City and despite some erratic performances – losing 6–0 in between two 5–1 wins, for example – City finished sixth in 1912–13, Chapman&#x27;s first season. Attendances rose at Elland Road from 8,500 to 13,000 in his first year, as Chapman&#x27;s attacking side scored 70 goals, the second-highest total in the entire division.

With a strengthening of the defence, City&#x27;s form improved further the next season, in 1913–14, coming fourth, two points outside the promotion places. Despite having failed on his promise to get the team promoted within two years, City&#x27;s rising attendances and resulting better profits for the club kept the directors happy, and the club were confident of promotion in 1914–15. However, the declaration of the First World War disrupted Leeds City&#x27;s season, with attendances down as men signed up to fight. Chapman by now had amassed a very large squad and was unable to pick a consistent side, continually changing his first-choice lineup. Leeds City lost six of their last eight games of the season, finishing just fifteenth.

League football was suspended for the rest of the war, with Leeds City playing in regional competitions. With many players away fighting or having left the game due to a drop in wages, Leeds relied heavily on guest players during these matches. Chapman, meanwhile, had decided to help the war effort by taking up a position as manager of a munitions factory at Barnbow, near Cross Gates in 1916. For the next two years, City&#x27;s assistant manager, George Cripps stood in for Chapman on the administrative side, while chairman Joe Connor and another director took charge of the team.

Chapman returned to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby to take up a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds&#x27; refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign of guilt, and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.

===Huddersfield Town===

Chapman was still working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was approached by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, who had been a former team-mate of Herbert Chapman&#x27;s brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were supposed to have been paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley&#x27;s assistant on 1 February 1921.

Chapman was promoted to full secretary-manager, replacing Langley, the following month, and soon made an impact, signing players such as England international Clem Stephenson from Aston Villa (who became captain under Chapman) and 18-year-old unknown George Brown (who went on to become Huddersfield&#x27;s all-time top scorer). In Chapman&#x27;s first full season in charge (1921–22), Huddersfield Town won the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 1–0 in the final at Stamford Bridge, the club&#x27;s first major trophy. In the league, however, his side had spent most of the season fighting relegation and had finished 14th, so Chapman looked to strengthen his squad.

As at Northampton, Chapman&#x27;s tactics were based upon the principles of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club&#x27;s reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network to find the right players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).

With new players and using Chapman&#x27;s system, Huddersfield were transformed. They finished third in 1922–23 and went on to win their first League title in 1923–24. This success was by the narrowest of margins – equal on points with Cardiff City, Huddersfield won by a difference of 0.024 (1.818 to 1.794) in goal average. The final goal by Brown in a 3–0 win over Nottingham Forest on the final day of the season proved crucial, although ultimately it was Huddersfield&#x27;s superior defensive record which had given them the advantage.

Following the title win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they successfully defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part caused by an injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman&#x27;s philosophy of relying on a strong defence, it was the first time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.

===Arsenal===

In the 1925 close season, Chapman had already set about improving his squad for Huddersfield to seek a third successive title (something which had never been achieved before). At the same time, Arsenal was looking to replace Leslie Knighton, who had been sacked. Arsenal chairman Sir Henry Norris placed an advertisement in the &quot;Athletic News&quot;:

Although Arsenal had been fighting relegation in both the two previous seasons, and despite the chairman&#x27;s restriction on spending, Chapman nevertheless moved to Arsenal soon afterwards, attracted both by the London club&#x27;s larger crowds and a salary of £2,000, double what he earned at Huddersfield Town. At Arsenal, Chapman immediately made an impact by signing 34-year-old Charlie Buchan, an England international and Sunderland&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer, whom he made Arsenal captain.

Chapman came to Arsenal promising to make them the &quot;Newcastle of the South&quot;. Chapman and Buchan&#x27;s arrival at the club also coincided with a change in the laws of the game in June 1925, that modified the offside law. The change had reduced the number of opposition players that an attacker needed between himself and the goal-line from three to two (including the goalkeeper). Buchan&#x27;s idea, implemented by Chapman, was to move the centre half from a roaming position in midfield to a &quot;stopper&quot; position in defence. With the inside forwards brought back to help the midfield, this changed the usual formation from 2–3–5 to 3–4–3, or a &quot;WM&quot;, so called after the shape it formed spelled out the letters. This meant the offside trap was now the responsibility of the single centre half, while the full backs were pushed wider to cover the wings.

Arsenal were by no means the only team to have come up with the idea of dropping the centre half into defence – Newcastle United beat Arsenal 7–0 that season employing such a system with Charlie Spencer at centre-half; Queen&#x27;s Park and Tottenham Hotspur had also adopted similar systems. Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence. Chapman himself summed it up by saying: &quot;the most opportune time for scoring is immediately after repelling an attack, because opponents are then strung out in the wrong half of the field.&quot;

Arsenal went on to finish second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman&#x27;s old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It proved to be an early dawn for Arsenal, who spent most of the rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, outlining a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton&#x27;s era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.

In February 1926, he signed the pacy winger Joe Hulme, followed that summer by forward Jack Lambert and full-back Tom Parker, who would later succeed Buchan as captain. Although Arsenal&#x27;s league form was indifferent, in 1927 they reached the FA Cup Final, their first, but lost 1–0 to Cardiff City after an error by goalkeeper Dan Lewis.

In the same year, Arsenal became embroiled in a scandal; footballers&#x27; pay at the time was limited by a maximum wage, but an FA inquiry found that Charlie Buchan had secretly received illegal payments from Arsenal as an incentive to sign for the club. Sir Henry Norris was indicted for his part and banned from football, but Chapman escaped punishment, and with the autocratic Norris replaced by the more benign Samuel Hill-Wood, Chapman&#x27;s power and influence within the club increased, allowing him control over all aspects of the club&#x27;s business. He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James and Cliff Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.

It was the signing of David Jack in particular that highlighted Chapman&#x27;s cunning when it came to transfer negotiations. Bolton Wanderers had originally asked for a fee of £13,000, almost double the existing record. Bob Wall, Chapman&#x27;s personal assistant at the time, later recounted the negotiations he made with Bolton&#x27;s directors as follows:

Chapman&#x27;s subterfuge succeeded, as he managed to bargain the inebriated Bolton directors down to £10,890. He was less successful in his attempt to sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory were on their way to a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for its new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.

Chapman had laid out a five-year plan for success in 1925, and it came to fruition exactly on schedule, as his Arsenal won their first major trophy in the 1930 FA Cup Final, beating his old side, Huddersfield Town, 2–0. Despite having finished only 14th in the League the same season, the win spurred Arsenal on and laid the foundations for a decade in which Arsenal would become the dominant team in England and eventually win five league titles.

Chapman had by now perfected Arsenal&#x27;s ruthless, counter-attacking strategy. He employed a robust front line of Lambert supported by David Jack and Alex James as deep-lying inside forwards, filling the gap vacated by the movement of the centre half into defence; Alex James in particular, with his passing supplying the front men, became celebrated as the engine of the team during the coming decade. Chapman employed Bastin and Hulme as pacy wingers who could cut inside instead of hugging the touchline; they could either shoot for goal themselves or pick each other out if the centre forward was marked out of the game. With the exception of James, keeping and dwelling on the ball and individuality were discouraged in favour of a quick passing game, although Chapman still conceded: &quot;All the men are expected to play to plan, but not so as to stifle individuality.&quot;

Chapman&#x27;s tactics of fast-moving play meant the wing half line of John and Jones were now pushed in to cover central midfield, pivoting around the halfway line so that they could drop back to defend when necessary. Chapman was equally committed to a strong defence, saying that maintenance of a back line was &quot;the rock bottom of football&quot;. Arsenal&#x27;s defence were told to play deep and, with the support of the wing halves, fall back into their own penalty area when the opposition had the ball; this allowed the opposition plenty of possession in Arsenal&#x27;s half, until they reached the 18-yard line and faced a massed defence. Once Arsenal regained the ball – usually through the centre half Herbie Roberts – the ball would be quickly passed forward and the wing halves would push up to support the attackers, meaning Arsenal could quickly commit as many as seven men forward as a unit to rapidly attack and try to score.

Chapman&#x27;s system demanded a high level of fitness from his players, something which he strongly emphasised. He balanced the need for players suited to each task – in which his skill in spotting the right players and his extensive scouting network proved vital – with adapting his system to account for their abilities. Though highly effective, Chapman&#x27;s fast, counter-attacking passing approach to football contrasted with how the game was traditionally played in England at the time, with its emphasis on dribbling, possession and dwelling on the ball, and thus brought accusations of &quot;Lucky Arsenal&quot; or &quot;Boring Arsenal&quot; from commentators and opposition. Nevertheless, despite the stereotype, in Arsenal&#x27;s first title-winning season of 1930–31, they scored 127 goals in the League, which still stands as a club record.

Having won both League and Cup in separate seasons with two clubs, Chapman was determined to go one better and win the Double – which had not yet been won in the 20th century – in 1931–32 but ended up missing out on both, finishing second in the League behind Everton and losing the 1932 FA Cup Final controversially to Newcastle United, with Newcastle&#x27;s equaliser coming after the ball had gone behind for a goal kick. Undeterred, Chapman kept faith with his side and launched a bid for the 1932–33 title. However, it was during this season that Arsenal suffered one of the most infamous defeats in their history.

In the FA Cup third round, Arsenal had been drawn against Walsall of the Third Division North. Arsenal, as the previous season&#x27;s losing finalists and league leaders, were clear favourites to win the match. On the day, five of the Arsenal first team were out with injury or flu and had their places taken by reserves. Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets. Chapman was enraged by the result, and showed his ruthlessness by selling one player, Tommy Black, who had conceded a penalty in the game, to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was sold to Brentford a week later.

Despite the FA Cup setback, Arsenal bounced back in the League, and with the same scoring form as in 1930–31, finished the season having scored 118 League goals in total, including a 5–0 win over rivals Aston Villa in that season&#x27;s title-deciding match. In the following close season, Chapman became the first professional manager in charge of England, albeit in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; unofficial capacity, for a summer tour of Europe. He did not have any input into the selection process, the team being determined by the FA&#x27;s International Selection Committee, but did advise on tactics and gave pre-match team talks. Chapman was in charge for a friendly against Italy in Rome on 13 May 1933, which finished 1–1, and England&#x27;s 4–0 win over Switzerland a week later.

Wary of his ageing Arsenal team and the club&#x27;s inadequate reserves (as proven by the Walsall match), it was around this time that Chapman noted to club director George Allison: &quot;The team&#x27;s played out, Mr Allison, we must rebuild&quot;. Chapman started the process, signing Ray Bowden, Pat Beasley and Jimmy Dunne, and had converted the young George Male from left half to right back. Chapman would not live to see the end of the season, let alone complete the task of rebuilding his side. Arsenal went into 1933–34 looking to retain the title, and started consistently; they worked their way to the top of the league and were a comfortable four points clear after a goalless draw with Birmingham on 30 December 1933. This proved to be Chapman&#x27;s last match in charge.

==Death==

Chapman celebrated New Year in London before travelling north on a scouting trip to see Bury play Notts County on 1 January 1934. The following day, he travelled to his native Yorkshire to watch Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal&#x27;s next opponents, before spending a final night in his home town of Kiveton Park. He returned to London nursing a cold but was well enough to watch an Arsenal third-team match against Guildford City. Soon afterwards, his illness suddenly worsened; pneumonia set in, and Chapman quickly succumbed. He died in the early hours of 6 January 1934 at his home in Hendon. He was buried four days later in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Hendon.

Chapman was survived by a widow, Annie, two sons, Ken (born 1908) and Bruce (born 1911), and two daughters, Molly (born 1915) and Joyce (born 1919). Ken was a rugby union player for Harlequins, and later served as president of the Rugby Football Union.

==Legacy==
Chapman was one of the first football managers in the modern sense of the word, taking full charge of the team, rather than letting board members pick the side. As well as his tactical innovations, he was a strong believer in physical fitness in football – he instituted a strict training regime and the use of physiotherapists and masseurs. He encouraged his players to openly discuss tactics and the game, instituting weekly team meetings at his clubs, and encouraged them to socialise in extra-curricular activities such as golf. He wrote regularly on football for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; newspaper, and a collection of his writings was published after his death in a book, entitled &quot;Herbert Chapman on Football&quot;.

Unlike many of his contemporaries in Britain, Chapman was a fan of the continental game and counted among his friends Hugo Meisl and Jimmy Hogan, coaches of the Austrian &quot;Wunderteam&quot; of the 1930s. As long ago as 1909, he had taken his Northampton side on a tour of Germany to play 1. FC Nürnberg, and at Arsenal he had instituted an ongoing series of home-and-away friendlies against the likes of Racing Club de Paris. Chapman had proposed a Europe-wide club competition more than twenty years before the European Cup was instituted, and regularly took his teams abroad to play foreign sides. He was one of the first managers to consider signing black and foreign players; as well as signing Walter Tull, one of the first black professionals in the game, for Northampton Town in 1911, he attempted to recruit Austrian international goalkeeper Rudy Hiden for Arsenal in 1930, but was blocked by the Ministry of Labour, after protests from the Players&#x27; Union and the Football League. However, in the same year he did succeed in signing Gerard Keyser, the first Dutchman to play English league football, as an amateur, and Hiden was signed by Jimmy Hogan for Racing Club de Paris.

After attending a night-time match in Belgium in 1930 with his friend Hugo Meisl, Chapman became an early advocate of floodlights. He had lights installed in Highbury&#x27;s new West Stand when it was constructed in 1932; however, they were used only for training, and Arsenal would have to wait until the 1950s for their officially sanctioned use in matches. Chapman oversaw much of the development of Highbury in the early 1930s, including the building of the West Stand and the addition of a clock which was eventually placed by the south terrace, giving it the name of the &quot;Clock End&quot;. He is also credited with being behind the renaming of London Underground&#x27;s Gillespie Road station to Arsenal. He even designed the scoreboard and turnstiles at the stadium.

Chapman advocated the use of white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal&#x27;s socks to make it easier for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal&#x27;s kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Chapman&#x27;s involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.

==Career statistics==
==Honours==

Although he did not win any major honours as a player, as a manager Chapman won a Southern League title in 1908–09 with Northampton Town, four Football League titles (1923–24 and 1924–25 with Huddersfield Town, 1930–31 and 1932–33 with Arsenal) and two FA Cups (1921–22 with Huddersfield Town, 1929–30 with Arsenal). After his death the team he had built at Arsenal, under his successors Joe Shaw and George Allison, went on to win the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, emulating his Huddersfield Town team by completing a hat-trick. No team was to repeat the feat until Liverpool between 1982 and 1984. Chapman was honorary president of Scottish amateur football club Chirnside United until his death in 1934.

In 2003, Chapman was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his impact as a manager. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorating Chapman was unveiled in March 2005, at the house in Hendon where Chapman lived from 1926 until his death. Chapman was the first footballer or football manager to be commemorated in this way by English Heritage. In 2004, on the seventieth anniversary of his death, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; named him the greatest British manager of all time in a poll.

In tribute to his achievements at Arsenal, a bronze bust of Chapman, sculpted by Jacob Epstein resided inside the marble halls of the East Stand of Arsenal Stadium, Highbury until its closure in 2006 and will be reinstated there once redevelopment work in the stadium is completed. A replica sits in the Directors&#x27; Entrance at Emirates Stadium; he is one of only two Arsenal managers to be honoured this way, the other being Arsène Wenger. Furthermore, Arsenal&#x27;s white away kit for the 2007–08 season was dedicated to Chapman and his achievements.

Huddersfield Town were presented with a replica of Chapman&#x27;s bust by Arsenal, to celebrate their centenary in 2008. Additionally, as part of their centennial, Huddersfield contested the inaugural Herbert Chapman Trophy against Arsenal at the Galpharm Stadium on 6 August 2008, which Arsenal won 2–1.

On 9 December 2011, Arsenal unveiled a statue of Chapman outside Emirates Stadium in celebration of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary. The club also unveiled statues of former players Tony Adams and Thierry Henry.

<text>Karl Spencer Lashley (June 7, 1890 – August 7, 1958) was an American psychologist and behaviorist remembered for his contributions to the study of learning and memory. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Lashley as the 61st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Lashley was born on June 7, 1890, in the town of Davis, West Virginia. He was the only child of Charles and Maggie Lashley. He grew up in a middle-class family with a reasonably comfortable life. Lashley&#x27;s father held various local political positions. His mother was a stay-at-home parent, and had a vast collection of books in the home. She brought in women from the community, whom she would teach various subjects. This is no doubt what gave Lashley his love of learning. Lashley has always held his family in high regard. He has said that his father was a kind man.

Lashley&#x27;s mother was a strong advocate of schooling, and she encouraged Lashley intellectually from an early age. Lashley was a very active boy, both physically and mentally. He was able to read by the age of four. His favorite thing to do as a child was to wander through the woods and collect animals, like butterflies and mice. He spent most of his childhood alone. Lashley did not have many friends. The reasons for his lack of friendships is unclear. Lashley graduated high school at age 14.

Lashley enrolled at West Virginia University, where he had originally intended to become an English major. He took a course in zoology, however, and switched his major to zoology due to his interactions with the professor John Black Johnston. Lashley wrote, &quot;Within a few weeks in his class I knew that I had found my life&#x27;s work&quot;.

After obtaining his Bachelor of Arts at West Virginia University, Lashley was awarded a teaching fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh, where he taught biology along with biological laboratories. While there he also carried out research which he used for his master&#x27;s thesis. Once Lashley completed his master&#x27;s degree, he studied at Johns Hopkins University, where he received his PhD in genetics in June 1911. He became a professor at University of Minnesota, University of Chicago, and Harvard University.

At Hopkins, Lashley minored in psychology under John B. Watson, whom he continued to work closely with him after receiving his PhD. It was during this time that Lashley worked with Shepherd Ivory Franz and was introduced to his training/ablation method. Watson had a great deal of influence on Lashley. Together the two conducted field experiments and studied the effects of different drugs on maze learning of rats. Watson helped Lashley to focus on specific problems in learning and experimental investigation, followed by locating the area of the cerebrum involved in learning and discrimination.

==Career==
Lashley&#x27;s career began with research concerning brain mechanisms and how they were related to sense receptors. He also conducted work on instinct as well as color vision. He studied many animals and primates, which had been an interest since his freshman year at college.

Lashley worked at the University of Minnesota from 1917 to 1926 and then at the Institute for Juvenile Research in Chicago before becoming a professor at the University of Chicago. After this he went to Harvard, but was dissatisfied and from there became the director of the Yerkes Laboratory of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida.

Lashley&#x27;s most influential research centered around the cortical basis of learning and discrimination. He researched this by looking at the measurement of behavior before and after specific, carefully quantified, induced brain damage in rats. Lashley trained rats to perform specific tasks (seeking a food reward), then lesioned specific areas of the rats&#x27; cortex, either before or after the animals received the training. The cortical lesions had specific effects on acquisition and retention of knowledge, but the location of the removed cortex had no effect on the rats&#x27; performance in the maze. This led Lashley to conclude that memories are not localized, but that they are widely distributed across the cortex. Today we know that distribution of engrams does in fact exist, but that the distribution is not equal across all cortical areas, as Lashley assumed. His study of V1 (primary visual cortex) led him to believe that it was a site of learning and memory storage (i.e. an engram) in the brain. He reached this erroneous conclusion due to imperfect lesioning methods.

By the 1950s, two separate principles had grown out of Lashley&#x27;s research: mass action and equipotentiality. &quot;Mass action&quot; refers to the idea that the rate, efficacy and accuracy of learning depend on the amount of cortex available. If cortical tissue is destroyed following the learning of a complex task, deterioration of performance on the task is determined more by the amount of tissue destroyed than by its location. &quot;Equipotentiality&quot; refers to the idea that one part of the cortex can take over the function of another part; within a functional area of the brain, any tissue within that area can perform its associated function. Therefore, to destroy a function, all the tissue within a functional area must be destroyed. If the area is not destroyed then the cortex can take over another part. These two principles grew out of Lashley&#x27;s research on the cortical basis of learning and discrimination.

==Later life==
In February 1954, while doing his teaching at Harvard, Lashley unexpectedly collapsed and was hospitalized. He was diagnosed with hemolytic anemia and put on a cortisone treatment. This eventually began to soften his vertebrae, and as a result a splenectomy was performed. Lashley was on the road to a full recovery until his trip to France with his wife Clair, where he once again unexpectedly collapsed, but this time to his death on August 7, 1958.

==Honors==

Lashley was elected to many scientific and philosophical societies, including the American Psychological Association (Council member 1926–1928; President, 1929), Eastern Psychological Association (President, 1937), Society of Experimental Psychologists, British Psychological Association (Honorary Fellow), American Society of Zoologists, American Society of Naturalists (President, 1947), British Institute for the Study of Animal Behavior (Honorary Member), American Society of Human Genetics, American Physiological Society, Harvey Society (Honorary Member), National Academy of Sciences (elected in 1930). In 1938, Lashley was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society, the oldest learned society in the United States, dating to 1743. Since 1957, the Society has awarded the annual Karl Spencer Lashley Award in recognition of work on the integrative neuroscience of behavior. In 1943, Lashley was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

Lashley was awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the University of Pittsburgh (1936), the University of Chicago (1941), Western Reserve University (1951), the University of Pennsylvania; in 1953, Johns Hopkins University presented him with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

==Criticisms==
Lashley had a reputation as an objective scientist, but Nadine Weidman has tried to expose him as racist and a genetic determinist. However, Donald Dewsbury and others have disputed the claim that he was a genetic determinist, citing research of Lashley&#x27;s in which he found evidence of both genetic and environmental influences on organisms. Dewsbury does admit, however, that Lashley was quite racist. He cites a line from a letter that Lashley wrote to a German colleague which reads: &quot;Too bad that the beautiful tropical countries are all populated by negros. Heil Hitler and Apartheit!&quot; This line alone would leave little debate on this matter, but he cites others as well.

<doc id="538268" wikidata="Q161385" url="?curid=538268" title="Szczecin Lagoon">
<text>Szczecin Lagoon (, ), also known as Oder Lagoon (), and Pomeranian Lagoon (), is a lagoon in the Oder estuary, shared by Germany and Poland. It is separated from the Pomeranian Bay of the Baltic Sea by the islands of Usedom and Wolin. The lagoon is subdivided into the &quot;Kleines Haff&quot; (, &quot;small lagoon&quot;) in the West and the &quot;Wielki Zalew&quot; (, &quot;great lagoon&quot;) in the East. An ambiguous historical German name was &quot;Frisches Haff&quot;, which later exclusively referred to the Vistula Lagoon.

==Geography==
From the South, the lagoon is fed by several arms of the Oder river and smaller rivers like Ziese, Peene, Zarow, Uecker, and Ina. In the North, the lagoon is connected to the Baltic Sea&#x27;s Bay of Pomerania with the three straits Peenestrom, Świna and Dziwna, which divide the mainland and the islands of Usedom and Wolin.

The lagoon covers an area of 687 km2, its natural depth is an average 3.8 metres, and 8.5 metres at maximum. The depth of shipping channels however can exceed 10.5 metres. Thus, the lagoon holds about 2.58 km3 of water. The annual average water temperature is 11 °C.

The Oder river and its confluences are responsible for 94% of the water loads discharged into the lagoon, amounting to an average annual 17 km3 or 540 m3 per second. All other confluences contribute a combined annual 1 km3. Since no reliable data for an inflow from the Baltic Sea exist, the combined inflow is an estimated 18 km3 from a catchment area of 129,000 km2, residing in the lagoon for an average 55 days before being discharged into the Pomeranian Bay. The nutrients thereby transported into the lagoon have made it hyper(eu)trophic to eutrophic. The straits Peenestrom, Świna and Dziwna are responsible for 17%, 69%, and 14% of the discharge, respectively.

The average salinity is between 0.5 and 2 grams of salt per kilogram of water (approximately equivalent to 0.5 and 2 parts per thousand [ppt]). Occasionally northerly winds reverse the direction of the Świna, admitting sea water from the Baltic Sea into the lagoon, raising the local salinity to 6 ppt.

==History==

In the 10th century, the emerging Polish state strove for the area, but likely did not succeed with establishing control.
Following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation, it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. In the 17th century, it passed to Sweden. Later on, it gradually passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in the 18th and 19th century, and from 1871 was part of unified Germany. In 1880, the &quot;Kaiserfahrt&quot; (&quot;Emperor&#x27;s passage&quot;) channel on Usedom was opened, a water route with a depth of 10 metres connecting the lagoon with the Baltic Sea by bypassing the eastern part of the Swine, allowing large ships to enter the lagoon and the seaport of Stettin quicker and safer.

The canal, approximately 12 km long and 10 metres deep, was dug by the German Empire between 1874 and 1880, during the reign of the first Kaiser Wilhelm (1797–1888) after whom it was named. Also, the work resulted in a new island named Kaseburg (Karsibór) being cut off from Usedom.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II in 1945, the eastern part of the lagoon became part of Poland, while the western part became part of East Germany. The &quot;Kaiserfahrt&quot; was renamed &quot;Piast Canal&quot;, after the Polish Piast dynasty, which first included the region to Poland in the 10th century.

The German-Polish border also divides the bight called Neuwarper See near , Luckow.

==Economy==
The lagoon has served as an important fishing grounds for centuries, as a major transportation pathway since the 18th century, and as a tourist destination since the 20th century.

Heringsdorf Airport on Usedom island is located on the shores of the lagoon.

==Nature==
The southern shore of the lagoon belongs to the Am Stettiner Haff Nature Park, its northern shore and the island of Usedom to the Usedom Island Nature Park. To the west is the Anklamer Stadtbruch Nature Reserve and, within it, the Anklamer Torfmoor, a protected wetland which is renaturalising after being used for peat extraction.

<text>Eanfrith (590–634) was briefly King of Bernicia from 633 to 634. His father was Æthelfrith, a Bernician king who had also ruled Deira to the south before being killed in battle around 616 against Raedwald of East Anglia, who had given refuge to Edwin, an exiled prince of Deira. His mother was Acha of Deira.

Edwin became king of Northumbria upon Æthelfrith&#x27;s death, and Eanfrith, who was, according to Bede, the eldest of Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons, went into exile to the north. In his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, Bede writes that &quot;For all the time that Edwin reigned, the sons of the aforesaid Etheifrid [Æthelfrith], who had reigned before him, with many of the nobility, lived in banishment among the Scots or Picts, and were there instructed according to the doctrine of the Scots, and received the grace of baptism.&quot;

Eanfrith married a Pictish princess and had a son, Talorcan, who later became a king of the Picts (653–657). Edwin was killed by the army of Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in October 633, and Eanfrith, taking the opportunity to return home, became king of Bernicia. He did not, however, rule Deira, which was held by a relative of Edwin, Osric. Bede tells us that as soon as Eanfrith became king, he &quot;renounced and lost&quot; his faith and returned to the &quot;abominations&quot; of his &quot;former idols&quot;.

It is possible that Eanfrith was initially cooperative with Cadwallon. The historian D. P. Kirby, pointing to Eanfrith&#x27;s evident ability to quickly exploit Edwin&#x27;s death, has speculated that &quot;a wide-ranging set of alliances&quot; that included both Cadwallon and Eanfrith may have existed. If there was a friendly relationship between Eanfrith and Cadwallon at first, however, it must not have lasted, since Bede reports that Eanfrith went to Cadwallon &quot;with only twelve chosen soldiers&quot; in an attempt to negotiate peace, but Cadwallon had him killed.

The year in which he and Osric ruled was subsequently deemed so abhorrent because of their paganism that it was decided to add that year to the length of the reign of the Christian Oswald of Bernicia (Eanfrith&#x27;s brother), who defeated Cadwallon and came to rule both Bernicia and Deira, so as to ignore the brief reigns of Eanfrith and Osric.

<text>A variable-rate mortgage, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), or tracker mortgage is a mortgage loan with the interest rate on the note periodically adjusted based on an index which reflects the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets. The loan may be offered at the lender&#x27;s standard variable rate/base rate. There may be a direct and legally defined link to the underlying index, but where the lender offers no specific link to the underlying market or index, the rate can be changed at the lender&#x27;s discretion. The term &quot;variable-rate mortgage&quot; is most common outside the United States, whilst in the United States, &quot;adjustable-rate mortgage&quot; is most common, and implies a mortgage regulated by the Federal government, with caps on charges. In many countries, adjustable rate mortgages are the norm, and in such places, may simply be referred to as mortgages.

Among the most common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually be related to the index. Consequently, payments made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate. Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.

Adjustable rates transfer part of the interest rate risk from the lender to the borrower. They can be used where unpredictable interest rates make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain. The borrower benefits if the interest rate falls but loses if the interest rate increases. The borrower also benefits from reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared to fixed or capped rate mortgages.

In contrast to fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages are unaffected by inflation risk, but they are exposed to the risk that real interest rates will change. Adjustable-rate mortgages usually charge lower interest rates than those with fixed rates. According to scholars, &quot;borrowers should generally prefer adjustable-rate over fixed-rate mortgages, unless interest rates are low.&quot;

== Characteristics ==

=== Index ===
* 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI)
* London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
* 12-month Treasury Average Index (MTA)
* Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT)
* National Average Contract Mortgage Rate
* Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW)
* Consumer Price Index (CPI) 

In some countries, banks may publish a prime lending rate which is used as the index. The index may be applied in one of three ways: directly, on a rate plus margin basis, or based on index movement.

A directly applied index means that the interest rate changes exactly with the index. In other words, the interest rate on the note exactly equals the index. Of the above indices, only the contract rate index is applied directly.

To apply an index on a rate plus margin basis means that the interest rate will equal the underlying index plus a margin. The margin is specified in the note and remains fixed over the life of the loan. For example, a mortgage interest rate may be specified in the note as being LIBOR plus 2%, with 2% being the margin and LIBOR being the index.

The final way to apply an index is on a movement basis. In this scheme, the mortgage is originated at an agreed upon rate, then adjusted based on the movement of the index. Unlike direct or index plus margin, the initial rate is not explicitly tied to any index; the &quot;adjustments&quot; are tied to an index.

===Basic features===
The most important basic features of ARMs are:
# Initial interest rate. This is the beginning interest rate on an ARM.
# The adjustment period. This is the length of time that the interest rate or loan period on an ARM is scheduled to remain unchanged. The rate is reset at the end of this period, and the monthly loan payment is recalculated.
# The index rate. Most lenders tie ARM interest rates changes to changes in an index rate. Lenders base ARM rates on a variety of indices, the most common being rates on one-, three-, or five-year Treasury securities. Another common index is the national or regional average cost of funds to savings and loan associations.
# The margin. This is the percentage points that lenders add to the index rate to determine the ARM&#x27;s interest rate.
# Interest rate caps. These are the limits on how much the interest rate or the monthly payment can be changed at the end of each adjustment period or over the life of the loan.
# Initial discounts. These are interest rate concessions, often used as promotional aids, offered the first year or more of a loan. They reduce the interest rate below the prevailing rate (the index plus the margin).
# Negative amortization. This means the mortgage balance is increasing. This occurs whenever the monthly mortgage payments are not large enough to pay all the interest due on the mortgage. This may be caused when the payment cap contained in the ARM is low enough such that the principal plus interest payment is greater than the payment cap.
# Conversion. The agreement with the lender may have a clause that allows the buyer to convert the ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage at designated times.
# Prepayment. Some agreements may require the buyer to pay special fees or penalties if the ARM is paid off early. Prepayment terms are sometimes negotiable.

The choice of a home mortgage loan is complicated and time consuming. As a help to the buyer, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board have prepared a mortgage checklist.

=== Caps ===

Any mortgage where payments made by the borrower may increase over time brings with it the risk of financial hardship to the borrower. To limit this risk, limitations on charges—known as &quot;caps&quot; in the industry—are a common feature of adjustable rate mortgages. Caps typically apply to three characteristics of the mortgage:

* frequency of the interest rate change
* periodic change in interest rate
* total change in interest rate over the life of the loan, sometimes called life cap

For example, a given ARM might have the following types of interest rate adjustment caps:

* interest adjustments made every six months, typically 1% per adjustment, 2% total per year
* interest adjustments made only once a year, typically 2% maximum
* interest rate may adjust no more than 1% in a year

Mortgage payment adjustment caps:

* maximum mortgage payment adjustments, usually 7.5% annually on pay-option/negative amortization loans

Life of loan interest rate adjustment caps:

* total interest rate adjustment limited to 5% or 6% for the life of the loan.

Caps on the periodic change in interest rate may be broken up into one limit on the first periodic change and a separate limit on subsequent periodic change, for example 5% on the initial adjustment and 2% on subsequent adjustments.

Although uncommon, a cap may limit the maximum monthly payment in absolute terms (for example, $1000 a month), rather than in relative terms.

ARMs that allow negative amortization will typically have payment adjustments that occur less frequently than the interest rate adjustment. For example, the interest rate may be adjusted every month, but the payment amount only once every 12 months.

Cap structure is sometimes expressed as &quot;initial adjustment cap&quot; / &quot;subsequent adjustment cap&quot; / &quot;life cap&quot;, for example 2/2/5 for a loan with a 2% cap on the initial adjustment, a 2% cap on subsequent adjustments, and a 5% cap on total interest rate adjustments. When only two values are given, this indicates that the initial change cap and periodic cap are the same. For example, a 2/2/5 cap structure may sometimes be written simply 2/5.

==Motives==
ARMs generally permit borrowers to lower their initial payments if they are willing to assume the risk of interest rate changes. There is evidence that consumers tend to prefer contracts with the lowest initial rates such as in the UK, where consumers tend to focus on immediate monthly mortgage costs. Decisions of consumers may also be affected by the advice that they get, and much of the advice is provided by lenders who may prefer ARMs because of financial market structures.

In many countries, banks or similar financial institutions are the primary originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank offered large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but derived most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), it would have an asset–liability mismatch because of interest rate risk. It would then be running the risk that the interest income from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that the savings and loan crisis was in part caused by the problem: the savings and loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed-rate mortgages and so were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.

Banking regulators pay close attention to asset-liability mismatches to avoid such problems, and they place tight restrictions on the amount of long-term fixed-rate mortgages that banks may hold in relation to their other assets. To reduce the risk, many mortgage originators sell many of their mortgages, particularly the mortgages with fixed rates.

For the borrower, adjustable rate mortgages may be less expensive but at the price of bearing higher risk. Many ARMs have &quot;teaser periods&quot;, which are relatively short initial fixed-rate periods (typically, one month to one year) when the ARM bears an interest rate that is substantially below the &quot;fully indexed&quot; rate. The teaser period may induce some borrowers to view an ARM as more of a bargain than it really represents. A low teaser rate predisposes an ARM to sustain above-average payment increases.

== Variants ==

===Hybrid ARMs===

A hybrid ARM features an interest rate that is fixed for an initial period of time, then floats thereafter. The &quot;hybrid&quot; refers to the ARM&#x27;s blend of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate characteristics. Hybrid ARMs are referred to by their initial fixed-rate and adjustable-rate periods, for example, 3/1, is for an ARM with a 3-year fixed interest-rate period and subsequent 1-year interest-rate adjustment periods. The date that a hybrid ARM shifts from a fixed-rate payment schedule to an adjusting payment schedule is known as the reset date. After the reset date, a hybrid ARM floats at a margin over a specified index just like any ordinary ARM.

The popularity of hybrid ARMs has significantly increased in recent years. In 1998, the percentage of hybrids relative to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was less than 2%; within six years, this increased to 27.5%.

Like other ARMs, hybrid ARMs transfer some interest-rate risk from the lender to the borrower, thus allowing the lender to offer a lower note rate in many interest-rate environments.

===Option ARMs===
An &quot;option ARM&quot; is typically a 30-year ARM that initially offers the borrower four monthly payment options: a specified minimum payment, an interest-only payment, a 15-year fully amortizing payment, and a 30-year fully amortizing payment.

These types of loans are also called &quot;pick-a-payment&quot; or &quot;pay-option&quot; ARMs.

When a borrower makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is less than the accruing interest, there is &quot;negative amortization&quot;, which means that the unpaid portion of the accruing interest is added to the outstanding principal balance. For example, if the borrower makes a minimum payment of $1,000 and the ARM has accrued monthly interest of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower&#x27;s loan balance. Moreover, the next month&#x27;s interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher principal balance.

Option ARMs are often offered with a very low teaser rate (often as low as 1%) which translates into very low minimum payments for the first year of the ARM. During boom times, lenders often underwrite borrowers based on mortgage payments that are below the fully amortizing payment level. This enables borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan (i.e., take on more debt) than would otherwise be possible. When evaluating an Option ARM, prudent borrowers will not focus on the teaser rate or initial payment level, but will consider the characteristics of the index, the size of the &quot;mortgage margin&quot; that is added to the index value, and the other terms of the ARM. Specifically, they need to consider the possibilities that (1) long-term interest rates go up; (2) their home may not appreciate or may even lose value or even (3) that both risks may materialize.

Option ARMs are best suited to sophisticated borrowers with growing incomes, particularly if their incomes fluctuate seasonally and they need the payment flexibility that such an ARM may provide. Sophisticated borrowers will carefully manage the level of negative amortization that they allow to accrue.

In this way, a borrower can control the main risk of an Option ARM, which is &quot;payment shock&quot;, when the negative amortization and other features of this product can trigger substantial payment increases in short periods of time.

The minimum payment on an Option ARM can jump dramatically if its unpaid principal balance hits the maximum limit on negative amortization (typically 110% to 125% of the original loan amount). If that happens, the next minimum monthly payment will be at a level that would fully amortize the ARM over its remaining term. In addition, Option ARMs typically have automatic &quot;recast&quot; dates (often every fifth year) when the payment is adjusted to get the ARM back on pace to amortize the ARM in full over its remaining term.

For example, a $200,000 ARM with a 110% &quot;neg am&quot; cap will typically adjust to a fully amortizing payment, based on the current fully indexed interest rate and the remaining term of the loan, if negative amortization causes the loan balance to exceed $220,000. For a 125% recast, this will happen if the loan balance reaches $250,000.

Any loan that is allowed to generate negative amortization means that the borrower is reducing his equity in his home, which increases the chance that he won&#x27;t be able to sell it for enough to repay the loan. Declining property values would exacerbate this risk.

Option ARMs may also be available as &quot;hybrids&quot;, with longer fixed-rate periods. These products would not be likely to have low teaser rates. As a result, such ARMs mitigate the possibility of negative amortization, and would likely not appeal to borrowers seeking an &quot;affordability&quot; product.

===Cash flow ARMs===
A cash flow ARM is a minimum payment option mortgage loan. This type of loan allows a borrower to choose their monthly payment from several options. These payment options usually include the option to pay at the 30-year level, 15-year level, interest only level, and a minimum payment level. The minimum payment level is usually lower than the interest only payment. This type of loan can result in negative amortization. The option to make a minimum payment is usually available only for the first several years of the loan.

Cash flow ARM mortgages are synonymous with &quot;option ARM&quot; or &quot;payment option ARM&quot; mortgages, however not all loans with cash flow options are adjustable. In fact, fixed rate cash flow option loans retain the same cash flow options as cash flow ARMs and option ARMs, but remain fixed for up to 30 years.

==Loan caps==

Loan caps provide payment protection against payment shock, and allow a measure of interest rate certainty to those who gamble with initial fixed rates on ARM loans. There are three types of Caps on a typical First Lien Adjustable Rate Mortgage or First Lien Hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage.

Initial Adjustment Rate Cap: The majority of loans have a higher cap for initial adjustments that&#x27;s indexed to the initial fixed period. In other words, the longer the initial fixed term, the more the bank would like to potentially adjust your loan. Typically, this cap is 2–3% above the Start Rate on a loan with an initial fixed rate term of three years or lower and 5–6% above the Start Rate on a loan with an initial fixed rate term of five years or greater.

Rate Adjustment Cap: This is the maximum amount by which an Adjustable Rate Mortgage may increase on each successive adjustment. Similar to the initial cap, this cap is usually 1% above the Start Rate for loans with an initial fixed term of three years or greater and usually 2% above the Start Rate for loans that have an initial fixed term of five years or greater.

Lifetime Cap: Most First Mortgage loans have a 5% or 6% Life Cap above the Start Rate (this ultimately varies by the lender and credit grade).

* Industry Shorthand for ARM Caps

Inside the business caps are expressed most often by simply the three numbers involved that signify each cap. For example, a 5/1 Hybrid ARM may have a cap structure of 5/2/5 (5% initial cap, 2% adjustment cap and 5% lifetime cap) and insiders would call this a 5-2-5 cap. Alternatively, a 1-year ARM might have a 1/1/6 cap (1% initial cap, 1% adjustment cap and 6% lifetime cap) known as a 1-1-6, or alternatively expressed as a 1/6 cap (leaving out one digit signifies that the initial and adjustment caps are identical).

* Negative amortization ARM caps

See the complete article for the type of ARM that Negative amortization loans are by nature. Higher risk products, such as First Lien Monthly Adjustable loans with Negative amortization and Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have different ways of structuring the Cap than a typical First Lien Mortgage. The typical First Lien Monthly Adjustable loans with Negative amortization loan has a life cap for the underlying rate (aka &quot;Fully Indexed Rate&quot;) between 9.95% and 12% (maximum assessed interest rate). Some of these loans can have much higher rate ceilings. The fully indexed rate is always listed on the statement, but borrowers are shielded from the full effect of rate increases by the minimum payment, until the loan is recast, which is when principal and interest payments are due that will fully amortize the loan at the fully indexed rate.

* Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)

Since HELOCs are intended by banks to primarily sit in second lien position, they normally are only capped by the maximum interest rate allowed by law in the state wherein they are issued. For example, Florida currently has an 18% cap on interest rate charges. They are risky to the borrower in the sense that they are mostly indexed to the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which is considered a Spot Index, or a financial indicator that is subject to immediate change (as are the loans based upon the Prime Rate). The risk to borrower being that a financial situation causing the Federal Reserve to raise rates dramatically (see 1980, 2006) would effect an immediate rise in obligation to the borrower, up to the capped rate.

== Popularity ==
Variable rate mortgages are the most common form of loan for house purchase in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada but are unpopular in some other countries such as Germany. Variable rate mortgages are very common in Australia and New Zealand. In some countries, true fixed-rate mortgages are not available except for shorter-term loans; in Canada, the longest term for which a mortgage rate can be fixed is typically no more than ten years, while mortgage maturities are commonly 25 years.

In many countries, it is not feasible for banks to lend at fixed rates for very long terms; in these cases, the only feasible type of mortgage for banks to offer may be adjustable rate mortgages (barring some form of government intervention). For example, the mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies. Since funds raised by UK building societies must be at least 50% deposits, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in mortgage interest and what they are paying in interest for deposits and other funding sources.

Countries where fixed rate loans are the common form of loan for a house purchase usually need to have a specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular &quot;Bausparkassen&quot;, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; it has to be done in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.

For those who plan to move within a relatively short period of time (three to seven years), variable rate mortgages may still be attractive because they often include a lower, fixed rate of interest for the first three, five, or seven years of the loan, after which the interest rate fluctuates.

===In Singapore===
In Singapore, ARM is commonly known as floating rate or variable rate mortgage. Unlike fixed-rate mortgage in the country, a floating rate mortgage has its interest rate varying during the entire duration of the loan. The loans can be pegged to the bank board rate, SIBOR, or SOR

Typically, the structure of the interest rate of the mortgage is as follows:

The loan can be pegged to SIBOR or SOR of any duration, and a spread (margin) is tacked to the X-month SIBOR/SOR. The spread is usually adjusted upwards after the first few years.

SIBOR-pegged ARMs are more popular than SOR-or board&amp;rate-pegged mortgages.

However, recently, ANZ introduced an ARM that is pegged to the average of SIBOR and SOR. So far, it is the only bank in Singapore to offer such a mortgage.

== Pricing ==
Adjustable rate mortgages are typically, but not always, less expensive than fixed-rate mortgages. Due to the inherent interest rate risk, long-term fixed rates will tend to be higher than short-term rates (which are the basis for variable-rate loans and mortgages). The difference in interest rates between short and long-term loans is known as the yield curve, which generally slopes upward (longer terms are more expensive). The opposite circumstance is known as an inverted yield curve and is relatively infrequent.

The fact that an adjustable rate mortgage has a lower starting interest rate does not indicate what the future cost of borrowing will be (when rates change). If rates rise, the cost will be higher; if rates go down, cost will be lower. In effect, the borrower has agreed to take the interest rate risk.

The actual pricing and rate analysis of adjustable rate mortgage in the finance industry is done through various computer simulation methodologies like Monte Carlo method or Sobol sequences. In these techniques, by using an assumed probability distribution of future interest rates, numerous (10,000–100,000 or even 1,000,000) possible interest rate scenarios are explored, mortgage cash flows calculated under each, and aggregate parameters like fair value and effective interest rate over the life of the mortgage are estimated. Having these at hand, lending analysts determine whether offering a particular mortgage would be profitable, and if it would represent tolerable risk to the bank.

== Prepayment ==
Adjustable rate mortgages, like other types of mortgage, usually allow the borrower to prepay principal (or capital) early without penalty. Early payments of part of the principal will reduce the total cost of the loan (total interest paid), but will not shorten the amount of time needed to pay off the loan like other loan types. Upon each recasting, the new fully indexed interest rate is applied to the remaining principal to end within the remaining term schedule.

If a mortgage is refinanced, the borrower simultaneously takes out a new mortgage and pays off the old mortgage; the latter counts as a prepayment.

Some ARMs charge &quot;prepayment penalties&quot; of several thousand dollars if the borrower refinances the loan or pays it off early, especially within the first three or five years of the loan.

== Criticism ==

===Predatory lending===
Adjustable rate mortgages are sometimes sold to consumers who are unlikely to repay the loan should interest rates rise. In the United States, extreme cases are characterized by the Consumer Federation of America as predatory loans. Protections against interest rate rises include (a) a possible initial period with a fixed rate (which gives the borrower a chance to increase his/her annual earnings before payments rise); (b) a maximum (cap) that interest rates can rise in any year (if there is a cap, it must be specified in the loan document); and (c) a maximum (cap) that interest rates can rise over the life of the mortgage (this also must be specified in the loan document).

===Interest rate errors and overcharges===

In September 1991, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study of Adjustable Rate Mortgages in the United States which found between 20% and 25% of the ARM loans out of the estimated 12 million at the time contained Interest Rate Errors. A former federal mortgage banking auditor estimated these mistakes created at least US$10 billion in net overcharges to American home-owners. Such errors occurred when the related mortgage servicer selected the incorrect index date, used an incorrect margin, or ignored interest rate change caps.

In July 1994, Consumer Loan Advocates, a non-profit mortgage auditing firm announced that as many as 18% of Adjustable Rate Mortgages have errors costing the borrower more than $5,000 in interest overcharges.

In December 1995, a government study concluded that 50–60% of all Adjustable Rate Mortgages in the United States contain an error regarding the variable interest rate charged to the homeowner. The study estimated the total amount of interest overcharged to borrowers was in excess of $8 billion. Inadequate computer programs, incorrect completion of documents and calculation errors were cited as the major causes of interest rate overcharges. No other government studies have been conducted into ARM interest overcharges.
===Ireland’s Tracker Mortgage Scandal===
In 2015, Ireland’s Central Bank recognised that the country had a problem with banks moving customers away from low interest, and unprofitable, tracker mortgages in an adverse manner, and setup an investigation into what had happened.

==History==
On April 3, 1980, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board voted to authorize savings and loan associations to offer the renegotiable-rate mortgage (RRM) to mortgagors for home purchases, the first variable rate mortgage in the United States. Under the regulations, the interest rate could be changed every three years, and could rise no more than 5 percentage points over the original APR life of a 30-year mortgage, or be lowered without limit. The new rule was made in response to a decrease in new housing starts and purchases by buyers hesitant about a long-term commitment to the high interest rates at the time, and was a concept similar to the &quot;rollover mortgage&quot; that were already in use in Canada.

TITLE VIII, ALTERNATIVE MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS, Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 allowed Adjustable rate mortgages.

In 2006, before the subprime mortgage crisis, over 90% of the subprime mortgages (which accounted for 20% of all mortgages) were adjustable-rate mortgages.

<text>The Dziwna () is a channel of the Oder River in northwestern Poland, one of three straits connecting the Szczecin Lagoon with the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea. It separates the island of Wolin from the Polish mainland. The other two channels are the Świna and the Peene.

About in length, the Dziwna forms on the eastern end of the Szczecin Lagoon, near the town of Zagórze, Kamień County. Flowing north, it passes the town of Wolin and then widens and forms a number of connected features. Towards the west the main channel of the Dziwna forms the large Kamieński Lagoon (&quot;Polish: Zalew Kamieński&quot;). To the east a side channel develops into the Zatoka Cicha (&quot;Quiet Bay&quot;, known as &quot;Die Maad&quot; before 1949), flows north through the strait of Promna as it approaches the city of Kamień Pomorski, then rejoins the Kamieński Lagoon. Between these two channels stands the small, largely agricultural island of Chrząszczewo connected to Kamień Pomorski by a single bridge.

The Kamieński Lagoon reforms into the well-defined Zatoka Wrzosowska (&quot;Wrzosowska Bay&quot;), narrows, then flows past the coastal city of Dziwnów for just a few kilometers as the Dziwna again before finally reaching the Bay of Pomerania.

<text>A fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) is a mortgage loan where the interest rate on the note remains the same through the term of the loan, as opposed to loans where the interest rate may adjust or &quot;float&quot;. As a result, payment amounts and the duration of the loan are fixed and the person who is responsible for paying back the loan benefits from a consistent, single payment and the ability to plan a budget based on this fixed cost.

Other forms of mortgage loans include interest only mortgage, graduated payment mortgage, variable rate mortgage (including adjustable-rate mortgages and tracker mortgages), negative amortization mortgage, and balloon payment mortgage. Unlike many other loan types, FRM interest payments and loan duration is fixed from beginning to end.

Fixed-rate mortgages are characterized by amount of loan, interest rate, compounding frequency, and duration. With these values, the monthly repayments can be calculated.

Fixed-rate mortgages are vulnerable to inflation risk, which means that borrowers with such mortgages are better off under unexpectedly high inflation (as the inflation lowers the real present value of their loan repayments), while they are worse off if there is a drop in inflation that lowers interest rates. Fixed-rate mortgages usually charge higher interest rates than those with adjustable rates. According to scholars, &quot;borrowers should generally prefer adjustable-rate over fixed-rate mortgages, unless interest rates are low.&quot;

== Usage throughout the world ==
The availability of fixed-rate mortgages varies between countries.

In the United States, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) helped develop and standardize the fixed rate mortgage as an alternative to the balloon payment mortgage by insuring them and by doing so helped the mortgage design garner usage. Because of the large payment at the end of the older, balloon-payment loan, refinancing risk resulted in widespread foreclosures. The fixed-rate mortgage was the first mortgage loan that was fully amortized (fully paid at the end of the loan) precluding successive loans, and had fixed interest rates and payments. Fixed-rate mortgages are the most classic form of loan for home and product purchasing in the United States. The most common terms are 15-year and 30-year mortgages, but shorter terms are available, and 40-year and 50-year mortgages are now available (common in areas with high housing costs, where even a 30-year term leaves the monthly payments out of reach of the average family).

In Canada, the longest term for which a mortgage rate can be fixed is typically no more than ten years, while mortgage maturities are commonly 25 years. In Denmark, fixed-rate 30-year mortgages are the standard form of home loan. A fixed rate mortgage in Singapore has the interest rate fixed for only the first three to five years of the loan, and it then becomes variable. In Australia, &quot;honeymoon&quot; mortgages with introductory rates are common, but can last as short as a year, and may instead offer a fixed reduction in interest rate rather than a fixed rate itself. Furthermore, they are often combined with properties of flexible mortgages to create what is known as an Australian mortgage, which often allow borrowers to overpay to reduce interest charges and then draw on these overpayments in the future.

In the UK, &quot;fixed-rate mortgage&quot; is the name given to an adjustable-rate mortgage with the interest rate locked in for the first two to five years. At the end of that time, many borrowers refinance their mortgages to lock in another stable rate for the next few years. The mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies, whose raised funds must be at least 50% deposits, so lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages, to reduce asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk. Lenders, in turn, influence consumer decisions which already prefer lower initial monthly payments. Nationwide Commercial recently issued a 30-year fixed rate mortgage as bridging finance.

== Comparisons ==
Fixed-rate mortgages are usually more expensive than adjustable rate mortgages. The inherent interest rate risk makes long-term fixed rate loans tend to have a higher interest rate than short-term loans. The relationship between interest rates for short and long-term loans is represented by the yield curve, which generally slopes upward (longer terms are more expensive). The opposite circumstance is known as an inverted yield curve and occurs less often.

The fact that a fixed-rate mortgage has a higher starting interest rate does not indicate that it is a worse type of borrowing than an adjustable-rate mortgage. If interest rates rise, the ARM will cost more, but the FRM will cost the same. In effect, the lender has agreed to take the interest rate risk on a fixed-rate loan.

Some studies have shown that the majority of borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages save money in the long term but also that some borrowers pay more. The price of potentially saving money, in other words, is balanced by the risk of potentially higher costs. In each case, a choice would need to be made based upon the loan term, the current interest rate, and the likelihood that the rate will increase or decrease during the life of the loan.

== Pricing ==
*&quot;Note&quot;: Fixed-rate mortgage interest may be compounded differently in other countries, such as in Canada, where it is compounded every 6 months.

The fixed monthly payment for a fixed rate mortgage is the amount paid by the borrower every month that ensures that the loan is paid off in full with interest at the end of its term. This monthly payment formula_1 depends upon the monthly interest rate formula_2 (expressed as a fraction, not a percentage, i.e., divide the quoted yearly nominal percentage rate by 100 and by 12 to obtain the monthly interest rate), the number of monthly payments formula_3 called the loan&#x27;s term, and the amount borrowed formula_4 known as the loan&#x27;s principal; rearranging the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity we get the formula for formula_1:
::formula_6
For example, for a home loan for $200,000 with a fixed yearly nominal interest rate of 6.5% for 30 years, the principal is formula_7, the monthly interest rate is formula_8, the number of monthly payments is formula_9, the fixed monthly payment formula_10. This formula is provided using the financial function in a spreadsheet such as Excel. In the example, the monthly payment is obtained by entering either of these formulas:
::
::formula_11

This monthly payment formula is easy to derive, and the derivation illustrates how fixed-rate mortgage loans work. The amount owed on the loan at the end of every month equals the amount owed from the previous month, plus the interest on this amount, minus the fixed amount paid every month.
::Amount owed at month 0: 
:::formula_4
::Amount owed at month 1: 
:::formula_13 ( principal + interest – payment)
:::formula_14 (equation 1)
::Amount owed at month 2: 
:::formula_15 
:::Using equation 1 for formula_16
:::formula_17
:::formula_18 (equation 2)
::Amount owed at month 3: 
:::formula_19
:::Using equation 2 for formula_20
:::formula_21
:::formula_22
::Amount owed at month N:
:::formula_23
:::formula_24
:::formula_25
:::formula_26 (equation 3)
:::Where formula_27 (equation 4) (see geometric progression)
:::formula_28 (equation 5)
::With the exception of two terms the formula_29 and formula_30 series are the same so when you subtract all but two terms cancel:
:::Using equation 4 and 5
:::formula_31
:::formula_32
:::formula_33
:::formula_34 (equation 6)
::Putting equation 6 back into 3:
:::formula_35 
::formula_36 will be zero because we have paid the loan off.
:::formula_37
::We want to know formula_1
:::formula_39
::Divide top and bottom with formula_40
:::formula_41

This derivation illustrates three key components of fixed-rate loans: (1) the fixed monthly payment depends upon the amount borrowed, the interest rate, and the length of time over which the loan is repaid; (2) the amount owed every month equals the amount owed from the previous month plus interest on that amount, minus the fixed monthly payment; (3) the fixed monthly payment is chosen so that the loan is paid off in full with interest at the end of its term and no more money is owed.

The vendor may sell off the fix element as a &quot;fixed to floating&quot; derivative, see Black-Scholes model.

<doc id="538304" wikidata="Q4212" url="?curid=538304" title="Ned Beatty">
<text>Ned Thomas Beatty (July 6, 1937 – June 13, 2021) was an American actor. In a career that spanned five decades, he appeared in more than 160 film and television roles. Throughout his career, Beatty gained a reputation for being &quot;the busiest actor in Hollywood&quot;. His film appearances included &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972), &quot;White Lightning&quot; (1973), &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), &quot;Network&quot; (1976), &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986), &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993), &quot;Shooter&quot; (2007), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), and &quot;Rango&quot; (2011). He also had the series regular role of Stanley Bolander in the first three seasons of the hit NBC TV drama &quot;&quot;.

Beatty was nominated for an Academy Award, two Emmy Awards, an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain, and a Golden Globe Award; he also won a Drama Desk Award.

==Early life==
Beatty was born on July 6, 1937, in Louisville, Kentucky, to Margaret (&quot;née&quot; Fortney) and Charles William Beatty. He had an older sister, Mary. In 1947, Beatty began singing in gospel and barbershop quartets in St. Matthews, Kentucky, and at his local church. He graduated from Eastern High School and subsequently received a scholarship to sing in the a cappella choir at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky; he attended but did not graduate.

In 1956, Beatty made his stage debut at age 19, appearing in &quot;Wilderness Road&quot;, an outdoor-historical pageant located in Berea, Kentucky. During his first ten years of theater, he worked at Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, the State Theatre of Virginia. Returning to Kentucky, Beatty worked in the Louisville area through the mid-1960s, at the Clarksville Little Theater (Indiana) and the newly founded Actors Theater of Louisville. His time at the latter included a run as Willy Loman in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; in 1966.

==Career==
Throughout his career, Beatty had no regrets about mostly only playing supporting roles: &quot;[Leading roles] are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth. I feel sorry for people in a star position. It&#x27;s unnatural&quot;.

===1970s===

In 1972, Beatty made his film debut as Bobby Trippe in &quot;Deliverance&quot;, starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds, and set in northern Georgia. Beatty&#x27;s character is forced to strip at gunpoint by two mountain men who humiliate and rape him, a scene so shocking that it is still referred to as a screen milestone. Beatty admitted that most of the people who worked on the film did not want to do that scene, but it was an important one. The film was the fifth highest grossing that year, and also featured &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; as its theme tune, which went on to be a number one hit record. In 1972, he also appeared in &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot;, a western with Paul Newman.

In 1973, Beatty had roles in &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot;, &quot;The Last American Hero&quot;, and &quot;White Lightning&quot;. The latter film reunited Beatty with his &quot;Deliverance&quot; co-star Burt Reynolds. He also appeared in an episode of the TV series &quot;The Waltons&quot; that year, as well as the TV movie &quot;The Marcus-Nelson Murders&quot;, which was the pilot for the series &quot;Kojak&quot;. The next year, he appeared in the television miniseries &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot; and in the two-part episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Profit and Loss&quot;. In 1975, he appeared in &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot;, in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;, and as Colonel Hollister in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode, &quot;Dear Peggy&quot;. He appeared in the NBC-TV movie &quot;Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan&quot; as Deputy Sheriff Ollie Thompson (1975). Beatty also made an appearance on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in &quot;The Hiders&quot; episode in 1975.

Beatty received his only Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actor category for the acclaimed film &quot;Network&quot; (1976), portraying a television network&#x27;s bombastic but shrewd chairman of the board who convinces the mad Howard Beale character (portrayed by Peter Finch) that corporation-led global dehumanization is not only inevitable, but is also a good thing. Neither Beatty nor William Holden, who shared the lead role with Finch, won an Oscar. The other three acting awards besides the best supporting actor category were swept by &quot;Network&quot; performers: Best Actor for Peter Finch, Best Actress for Faye Dunaway, and Best Supporting Actress for Beatrice Straight. The Best Supporting Actor award went to Jason Robards for his role in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, which also starred Beatty.

In 1976, he also appeared in &quot;The Big Bus&quot;, &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, and &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot;. In 1977, he returned to work with John Boorman in &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977), and appeared in &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;, the first episode of the television series &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot;. During 1977-78, he starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Szysznyk&quot; on CBS.

In 1978, Beatty appeared in &quot;Gray Lady Down&quot; (1978), a drama aboard a submarine starring Charlton Heston. The film is significant chiefly for being the screen debut of Christopher Reeve, Beatty&#x27;s future co-star. Later that year, Beatty was cast by Richard Donner to portray Lex Luthor&#x27;s inept henchman Otis in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; (1978), as he would in the 1980 sequel, where his character is seen being left behind in prison. He received his first nomination for Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special for the television series &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; (1979). In 1979, he was also seen in &quot;Wise Blood&quot;, directed by John Huston, and &quot;1941&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg.

===1980s===
In 1980, Beatty appeared in Ronald Neame&#x27;s film &quot;Hopscotch&quot; with Walter Matthau. In 1981, Beatty appeared in the comedy/science fiction film &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Lily Tomlin. In 1982, Beatty returned to work with Richard Donner and Richard Pryor in the comedy &quot;The Toy&quot;. Beatty worked with Burt Reynolds again in the auto-racing farce &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; (1983).

In the middle of the 1980s, Beatty appeared in the comedy film &quot;Restless Natives&quot; (1985), directed by Michael Hoffman. By the end of the 1980s, Beatty appeared in another comedy film, as the academic &quot;Dean Martin&quot; in &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986), starring Rodney Dangerfield. He played a corrupt cop in the 1987 American neo-noir crime film &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, directed by Jim McBride and starring Dennis Quaid, and continued with a spy drama, &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; (1987), opposite Michael Caine and Pierce Brosnan.

In 1988, Beatty appeared with the main character Thelonious Pitt in &quot;Shadows in the Storm&quot;, and reunited with Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve for the comedy film &quot;Switching Channels&quot;, his fifth time in a movie with Reynolds. He appeared in &quot;Purple People Eater&quot; (1988), portraying a simple grandfather. In 1989, Beatty made &quot;Chattahoochee&quot;, portraying Dr. Harwood. He had a recurring role as the father of John Goodman&#x27;s character Dan Conner on the TV comedy series &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1989–1994).

===1990s===

Entering the 1990s, Beatty gained his third nomination for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special category for &quot;Last Train Home&quot; (1990). A year later, he appeared in the British film &quot;Hear My Song&quot; (1991), in which he portrayed tenor Josef Locke, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

In 1990, Beatty worked again with Linda Blair in &quot;Repossessed&quot; (1990), a spoof of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. He appeared in the Marvel Comics superhero adventure &quot;Captain America&quot; (1990). He portrayed the father of the bride in &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; (1992), opposite Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin. In 1993, he appeared in the true story based film &quot;Rudy&quot;, playing a Notre Dame Fighting Irish football fan whose son, against all odds, makes the school&#x27;s football team. In 1992, he played Blanche Devereaux&#x27;s developmentally disabled older brother in the TV show &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;. Beatty starred in the television series &quot;&quot; as Detective Stanley Bolander for its first three seasons (1993–1995).

Beatty made the 1994 science-fiction film &quot;Replikator&quot; (1994) and mystery-comedy &quot;Radioland Murders&quot;. In 1995, he worked with Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne in the thriller &quot;Just Cause&quot;. He appeared as Judge Roy Bean in the TV miniseries adaptation of Larry McMurtry&#x27;s western novel, &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; (1995). David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker wanted Beatty to play John Doe in &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), because of his resemblance to the 1969 composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer; Beatty declined, describing the script as the &quot;most evil thing I&#x27;ve ever read.&quot; He appeared in a 1998 sports-drama film written and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington, &quot;He Got Game&quot;. In 1999, Beatty returned to work with &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Spring Forward&quot;.
===2000s===
In the beginning of the 2000s, he was a member of the original cast of the television police drama reunion film &quot;Homicide: The Movie&quot; (2000), reprising his role of Detective Stanley Bolander. In 2002, he appeared in Peter Hewitt&#x27;s film &quot;Thunderpants&quot;. In 2003, he portrayed a simple sheriff in &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;.

Beatty also enjoyed a career as a stage actor, including a run in the Broadway and London productions of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; with Brendan Fraser and Frances O&#x27;Connor. He won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play for playing Big Daddy in a production of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;.

In the middle of the 2000s, Beatty appeared in the television film &quot;The Wool Cap&quot; (2004) with William H. Macy, and in 2005, in an American independent film directed and written by Ali Selim, &quot;Sweet Land&quot;. In March 2006, Beatty received the RiverRun International Film Festival&#x27;s &quot;Master of Cinema&quot; Award (the highest honor of the festival), in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

At the end of the 2000s, Beatty portrayed a corrupt U.S. Senator in the film version of Stephen Hunter&#x27;s novel &quot;Point of Impact&quot; retitled &quot;Shooter&quot; (2007), directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Mark Wahlberg, Michael Peña, and Danny Glover; in a drama film written and directed by Paul Schrader, &quot;The Walker&quot; (2007), and as the honorable U.S. Congressman Doc Long in the true story &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007), with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, directed by Mike Nichols. He also worked with Tommy Lee Jones in the thriller &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot; (2009).

===2010s===
In 2010, Beatty starred in the thriller &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; (2010), which was part of the Sundance Film Festival. He also voiced Lots-O&#x27;-Huggin&#x27; Bear in the 2010 Disney/Pixar film &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) opposite &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; costar Tom Hanks, who was reprising his role of Woody from the first two films. In 2011, Beatty worked with actor Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski in the animated film &quot;Rango&quot; (2011), playing the role of Tortoise John. He appeared briefly in the film &quot;Funny Guy&quot; and in the film &quot;Rampart&quot; (2011), opposite Woody Harrelson, which is set in 1999 Los Angeles. Beatty&#x27;s final television appearance was in sitcom television series &quot;Go On&quot; (2013), starring Matthew Perry.

Beatty&#x27;s next film was &quot;The Big Ask&quot; (2013), a dark comedy about three couples who head to the desert to help their friend heal after the death of his mother. The film featured Gillian Jacobs, Zachary Knighton, David Krumholtz, Melanie Lynskey, Ahna O&#x27;Reilly, and Jason Ritter, and was directed by his son Thomas Beatty and Rebecca Fishman. His other next movie was &quot;Baggage Claim&quot; (2013), an American comedy film directed by David E.

<text>Java 2D is an API for drawing two-dimensional graphics using the Java programming language. Every Java 2D drawing operation can ultimately be treated as &quot;filling&quot; a &quot;shape&quot; using a &quot;paint&quot; and &quot;compositing&quot; the result onto the screen.The Java 2D is a set of classes for advanced 2D graphics and imaging. It encompasses line art, text, and images in a single comprehensive model. The API provides extensive support for image compositing and alpha channel images, a set of classes to provide accurate color space definition and conversion, and a rich set of display-oriented imaging operators.

==Organization==
The Java 2D API and its documentation are available for download as a part of JDK 6. Java 2D API classes are organised into the following packages in JDK 6:
*&quot; The main package for the Java Abstract Window Toolkit.
*&quot; The Java standard library of two dimensional geometric shapes such as lines, ellipses, and quadrilaterals.
*&quot; The library for manipulating glyphs in Java.
*&quot; The library dealing with the many different ways that color can be represented.
*&quot; The library for manipulating graphical images.
*&quot; The library of tools for writing to paper.

==Basic concepts==
These objects are a necessary part of every Java 2D drawing operation.

===Shapes===
A &quot;shape&quot; in Java 2D is a boundary which defines an inside and an outside. Pixels inside the shape are affected by the drawing operation, those outside are not.

Trying to fill a straight line segment will result in no pixels being affected, as such a shape does not contain any pixels itself. Instead, a thin rectangle must be used so that the shape contains some pixels.

===Paints===
A &quot;paint&quot; generates the colors to be used for each pixel of the fill operation. The simplest paint is , which generates the same color for all pixels. More complicated paints may produce gradients, images, or indeed any combination of colors. Filling a circular shape using the color yellow results in a solid yellow circle, while filling the same circular shape using a paint that generates an image produces a circular cutout of the image.

===Composites===
During any drawing operation, there is a &quot;source&quot; (the pixels being produced by the paint) and a &quot;destination&quot; (the pixels already onscreen). Normally, the source pixels simply overwrite the destination pixels, but the &quot;composite&quot; allows this behavior to be changed.

The composite, given the source and destination pixels, produces the final result that ultimately ends up onscreen. The most common composite is , which can treat the pixels being drawn as partially transparent, so that the destination pixels show through to some degree.

===Filling===
To &quot;fill&quot; a shape, the first step is to identify which pixels fall inside the shape. These pixels will be affected by the fill operation. Pixels that are partially inside and partially outside the shape may be affected to a lesser degree if anti-aliasing is enabled.

The paint is then asked to generate a color for each of the pixels to be painted. In the common case of a solid-color fill, each pixel will be set to the same color.

The composite takes the pixels generated by the paint and combines them with the pixels already onscreen to produce the final result.

==Advanced objects==
These objects can be viewed as performing their duties in terms of the simpler objects described above.

===Transform===
Every Java 2D operation is subject to a transform, so that shapes may be translated, rotated, sheared, and scaled as they are drawn. The active transform is most often the identity transform, which does nothing.

Filling using a transform can be viewed as simply creating a new, transformed shape and then filling that shape.

===Stroke===
In addition to the &quot;fill&quot; operation, Java 2D provides a &quot;draw&quot; operation. While fill draws the interior of a shape, draw draws its outline. The outline can be as simple as a thin line, or as complicated as a dashed line with each dash having rounded edges.

The object responsible for generating the outline is the &quot;stroke&quot;. Given an input shape, the stroke produces a new shape representing its outline. For instance, an infinitely thin line segment (with no interior) might be stroked into a one-pixel-wide rectangle.

A draw operation can therefore be described as creating a new, stroked object and then filling that object.

Technically speaking, the stroke is only required to accept an input shape and produce a new shape. The stroke implementation provided with Java 2D implements the outline rules described above, but a custom-written stroke could produce any shape it wished.

==Optimizations==
Conceptually, drawing a straight black line in Java 2D can be thought of as creating a line segment, transforming it according to the current transform, stroking it to create a thin rectangle, querying this shape to compute the pixels being affected, generating the pixels using , and then compositing the results onto the screen.

However, performing this entire sequence of steps for each drawing operation would be very inefficient. Java 2D therefore optimizes common drawing operations so that many of these steps can be skipped. If the paint is a simple solid color, for instance, there is no need to actually command it to generate a list of colors to be painted. Likewise, if the default fully opaque composite is in use, actually asking it to perform the compositing operation is unnecessary and would waste effort.

Java 2D performs the minimum amount of work necessary to make it &quot;seem&quot; as if it is performing all of these steps for each operation, therefore retaining both great flexibility and high performance.

==Destination==
For simplicity, the textual examples provided in this article have assumed that the screen is the destination device. However, the destination can be anything, such as a printer, memory image, or even an object which accepts Java 2D graphics commands and translates them into vector graphic image files.

==Java2D / OpenGL interoperability==
Since Java SE 6, Java2D and OpenGL have become interoperable, allowing, for example, the drawing of animated 3D graphics instead of icons on a Button (see JOGL).

<doc id="538325" wikidata="Q33685" url="?curid=538325" title="Limited company">
<text>In a limited company, the liability of members or subscribers of the company is limited to what they have invested or guaranteed to the company. Limited companies may be limited by shares or by guarantee. In a company limited by shares, the liability of members is limited to the unpaid value of shares. In a company limited by guarantee, the liability of owners is limited to such amount as the owners may undertake to contribute to the assets of the company, in the event of being wound up. The former may be further divided in public companies (public limited companies) and private companies (private limited companies). Who may become a member of a private limited company is restricted by law and by the company&#x27;s rules. In contrast, anyone may buy shares in a public limited company.

Limited companies can be found in most countries, although the detailed rules governing them vary widely. It is also common for a distinction to be made between the publicly tradable companies of the &quot;plc&quot; type (for example, the German (AG), Dutch and Belgian nv, British PLC, Czech a.s., Italian S.p.A., Hungarian nyrt. and the Spanish, French, Polish, Greek and Romanian S.A.), and the &quot;private&quot; types of companies (such as the German GmbH, Dutch and Belgian bv, Portuguese Lda., British Ltd, Japanese G.K., Polish sp. z o.o., Russian ООО, Ukrainian ТОВ (TOV), the Czech s.r.o., the French s.à r.l., the Italian s.r.l., Romanian s.r.l., Hungarian kft., Bulgarian ДОО (DOO), Slovenian d.o.o., and Slovak s.r.o., in India Pvt Ltd for private company and Ltd for public company, in Singapore Pte Ltd for private company.

==Types==

===Private company limited by guarantee ===
This is a company that does not have share capital, but is guaranteed by its &quot;members&quot;, who agree to pay a fixed amount in the event of the company&#x27;s liquidation. Charitable organisations are often incorporated using this form of limited liability. Another example is the Financial Conduct Authority. In Australia, only an unlisted public company can be limited by guarantee.

===Private company limited by shares===
Has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public. Shareholders of private companies limited by shares are always bound to offer the shares to their fellow shareholders prior to selling them to a third party.

===Public limited company===
A public limited company can be publicly traded on a stock exchange; this is similar to the U.S. Corporation (Corp.) and the German (AG).

==In specific countries==

===Australia===
The private company equivalent in Australia is the Proprietary Limited company (Pty Ltd). An Australian company with only &quot;Limited&quot; or &quot;Ltd&quot; after its name is a public company, such as a company listed on the ASX. Australia does not have a direct equivalent to the plc.

A shareholder in a limited company, in the event of its becoming insolvent (equivalent to insolvency in the United Kingdom) would be liable to contribute the amount remaining unpaid on the shares (usually zero, as most shares are issued fully paid). &quot;Paid&quot; here relates to the amount paid to the company for the shares on first issue, and should not be confused with amounts paid by one shareholder to another to transfer ownership of shares between them. A shareholder is thus afforded limited liability.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, a limited company is registered as any other type of company. To register it, you must pay an accountant to research the name of your future business to check if it was not already registered, then the accountant contacts the offices responsible for giving you the CNPJ (the national code for company identification), which are the commercial joint of the state and the IRS. After that the Ltda. or Lda. (rarely used) suffixes can be placed after the companies name or with Cia. (abbreviation for &quot;companhia&quot;, company in Portuguese): [company name] &amp; Cia. Ltda.

===Canada===
In Canada, a person wishing to register a limited company must file &quot;Articles of Incorporation&quot; with either their provincial government or the federal government. At the time of incorporation, a company must elect to use &quot;Limited&quot; (Ltd.), &quot;Incorporated&quot; (Inc.) or &quot;Corporation&quot; (Corp.) as part of their name.

=== India ===
In India, there are three types of limited company: a public limited company, a private limited company, and a one-person company. A company&#x27;s liability may be limited by shares, in which case the liability of the company&#x27;s members is limited to the amount of the shares held by them, or it may be limited by guarantee, in which case the liability is limited to a predetermined amount the company&#x27;s members have agreed to contribute if the company is dissolved with outstanding liabilities. A private limited company is a limited company incorporated under the Companies Act 2013 (or one of its predecessor acts), with a minimum paid-up share capital (if any) of , with an article that restricts the transfer of its shares; it may have between two and two hundred members, and its name ends with &quot;Private Limited&quot; (abbreviated Pvt Ltd). A public limited company must have a paid-up share capital of at least , and at least seven members; its name ends &quot;Limited&quot; (abbreviated Ltd). A one-person company (OPC) is a private company with similar proprietorship and privileges to a private limited company, but with fewer requirements; this type of company may have only one director and member.

Before 2015, the business organisations that wanted to take up a company as the preferred form of business organisation had to fulfill the requirement of minimum paid-up share capital of not less than 5 lakhs in case of public company and 1 lakh in case of private companies by way of Section 2(71) and 2(68) respectively. However, after in the recent Companies Amendment Act 2015, this requirement is scrapped, and a company can go ahead with its incorporation without fulfilling this criterion.

=== Nigeria===
In Nigeria, there are two types of limited companies namely: a company limited by guarantee and a company limited by shares. The company limited by shares is further divided into two namely a Private limited company (Ltd.) and a Public limited company (Plc.)

However, some states permit corporations to have the designation &quot;Ltd.&quot; (instead of the usual &quot;Inc.&quot;) to signify their corporate status. A corporation must file annual corporate tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.

<doc id="538327" wikidata="Q6038522" url="?curid=538327" title="Inspiration (William Hung album)">
<text>Inspiration, originally planned to be True Idol, is the debut full-length studio album by William Hung, a former hopeful &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant. The album was recorded at Fantasy Studios and released by Koch Entertainment, now Entertainment One in 2004, after his audition. Although the album was commercially successful, it received a highly negative critical reception due to Hung&#x27;s poor vocals and the sound of the karaoke tracks used on the album.

==Development==

The album was recorded following the early 2004 broadcast of his failed &quot;Idol&quot; audition where Hung, a 20-year-old civil engineering student, received notoriety and a cult following due to an enthusiastic yet mediocre performance of &quot;She Bangs&quot;. When rejected for advancement, he kept a positive attitude and proclaimed he&#x27;d done his best and had &quot;no regrets&quot;.

The album released on April 6, 2004, by Koch Entertainment, now Entertainment One. The album was recorded the weekend of March 6, 2004, with Hung singing vocals over digital MIDI music, with real musicians occasionally playing as well. The album was put together in 5 weeks. The album includes a 40-minute DVD documentary entitled &quot;A Day in the Life of a Small William Hung&quot;.

==Release and commercial performance==
Two weeks before the release of &quot;Inspiration&quot;, iTunes did a &quot;Pre-Release Teaser&quot; where they sold four tracks from the album. The tracks received a total of 25,000 downloads. To promote the album, Hung performed before nearly 20,000 fans during half-time at a Golden State Warriors game on April 6. Later that week, he performed his signature song, &quot;She Bangs&quot;, on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;.

The album peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart at No. 34, selling 37,676 units during its first week and peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Album chart. The album was the fifth best seller at Trans World stores, and at Tower Records was No. 14, behind Modest Mouse. The album has sold a total of 200,000 copies.

==Critical reception==
Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave &quot;Inspiration&quot; one star out of five, but adding it was still worth a chuckle or two for those wanting a laugh, &quot;since it has some of the worst singing ever captured on record&quot;. He also said that the album should have been a four-track single or extended play, because &quot;there are really only four tracks of note and that&#x27;s about all that anybody could take of this anyway.&quot; The album was scored by IGN&#x27;s Chris Cale a 0.5 out of ten, remarking that Hung smattered other musicians&#x27; hits, took the time to &quot;carefully destroy each and every one&quot; and that Hung&#x27;s &quot;music is a cacophony of wrong-notes, stoic delivery and shoddy rhythm&quot;, warning readers not to buy the album. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, who graded the album an F, said that it &quot;adds a particularly ugly race card&quot; to the tradition of &quot;William Shatner to schizophrenic indie-rock icon Wesley Willis.&quot;

<text>Maximilian Nepomuk Mutzke (born 21 May 1981) is a German singer, songwriter and television personality. He gained public interest in early 2004 when he won &quot;SSDSGPS&quot;, a talent contest hosted in Stefan Raab&#x27;s late-night show &quot;TV total&quot;. Mutzke subsequently qualified for and won the national pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, &quot;Germany 12 Points!&quot;, and thus represented Germany with his debut single &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Until Tonight&quot; that year, eventually finishing eighth in a field of 24 participants. Meanwhile, &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Until Tonight&quot; debuted atop the German singles chart and became a top five hit in Austria and Switzerland. His eponymous debut album, a mixture of soul and pop songs in German and English language, was released in January 2005 and also reached number one in Germany, where it was certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI).

Mutzke followed this with a series of studios albums, which were released to varying commercial success, including &quot;...aus dem Bauch&quot; (2007), &quot;Black Forest&quot; (2008), &quot;Home Work Soul&quot; (2010), &quot;Durch Einander&quot; (2012), &quot;Max&quot; (2015) and &quot;Colors&quot; (2018). In 2014, he represented Baden-Württemberg at the Bundesvision Song Contest 2014, where he finished seventh with his song &quot;Charlotte&quot;. In 2019, Mutzke won the debut season of the German edition of the international music game show &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. For his work as a recording artist, Mutzke has won several high-profile prizes such as the 1LIVE Krone and the Goldene Stimmgabel. Beyond his music career, he has been featured as a coach on the reality competition television series &quot;Dein Song&quot;.

== Career ==

Mutzke started his career in a funk band called &quot;Project Five&quot;. He gained public interest in spring 2004 when he won &quot;SSDSGPS&quot; (&quot;Stefan sucht den Super-Grand-Prix-Star&quot;), a talent contest hosted in Stefan Raab&#x27;s Late-Night-Show &quot;TV total&quot;. Afterwards he released his first single &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Until Tonight&quot; (composed by Raab), which entered the German single charts at No. 1 on 22 March 2004 and eventually met the conditions laid down for Max to be admitted into Germany&#x27;s pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 as a wild-card entry.

In the televoting of the final show on 19 March 2004 Max defeated nine other competitors (including established artists like Scooter or Sabrina Setlur). A majority of 92.95% of all votes made him the German entry for the 49th Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul, where he finished eighth with 93 points.

Thereupon the singer went back to school and passed his final high school examination, before teaming up with Raab once again to finish his self-titled solo album in summer 2004. The record, a mixture of funk, soul and pop in German and in English language, debuted at No. 1 on the German album charts and spawned the singles &quot;Schwarz Auf Weiß&quot;, &quot;Spür Dein Licht&quot; and &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. From May to June 2005 Max then went on a club tour across Germany, Austria and Switzerland, before touring with Katie Melua.

His second album &quot;Max Mutzke ...aus dem Bauch&quot; was released on 8 June 2007. His third album &quot;Max Mutzke ... Black Forest&quot; was released on 28 November 2008.

In 2010, he co-wrote the song &quot;I Care for You&quot; for Jennifer Braun, who placed second in the German national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010.

In 2020, Mutzke represented The Moon in the Free European Song Contest 2020 (which served as a replacement for that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest due to it being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic) under the name &quot;Der Astronaut&quot; with the song &quot;Back to the Moon&quot;. It came in third place with 85 points.

He competed in the for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with the song &quot;Forever Strong&quot;, ultimately coming second.

<doc id="538349" wikidata="Q1063383" url="?curid=538349" title="Charles F. Adams-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class is a ship class of 29 guided-missile destroyers (DDG) built between 1958 and 1967. Twenty-three were built for the United States Navy, three for the Royal Australian Navy, and three for the West German &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;. The design of these ships (known as project SCB 155) was based on that of s, but the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class were the first class designed to serve as guided-missile destroyers. of length was added to the center of the design of the &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; class to carry the ASROC launcher. The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class were the last steam turbine-powered destroyers built for the U.S. Navy. Starting with the succeeding &quot;Spruance-class&quot;, all U.S. Navy destroyers have been powered by gas turbines. Some of the U.S. &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class served during the blockade of Cuba in 1962 and during the Vietnam War; those of the Royal Australian Navy served during the Vietnam War and Gulf War.

==New threat update program and decommissioning==
Although designed with cutting-edge technology for the 1950s, by the mid-1970s it was clear to the Navy that the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class destroyers were not prepared to deal with modern air attacks and guided missiles. To reduce this vulnerability, the U.S. Navy began the New Threat Upgrade (NTU) program. This consisted of a number of sensor, weapons and communications upgrades that were intended to extend the service lives of the ships. Under the NTU, these destroyers received improved electronic warfare capability through the installation of the AN/SLQ-32(V)2 EW Suite.

The upgraded combat system would include the MK86 Gun Fire Control System with AN/SPQ-9 radar, the Hughes AN/SPS-52C 3D radar, the AN/SPG-51C (Digital) Fire Control Radars, and the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS). These ships were also planned to have the ability to launch several &quot;Harpoon&quot; anti-ship missiles, which were to be installed in their MK-11 or MK-13 Tartar missile launcher.

During the 1980s, the Reagan Administration chose to accelerate production of the guided-missile cruisers and build the guided-missile destroyers, both classes with the Aegis Combat System that was considered more effective than NTU-upgraded ships, to gradually replace all existing destroyer and cruiser classes (especially the expensive nuclear-powered cruisers). The result of this was that only three of &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class destroyers, , , and received the full upgrade. Other ships, of the class, such as &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;, received only partial upgrades, which included the AN/SLQ-32 and Harpoon Missile upgrades, that were intended to extend their service lives until the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class could reach operational capability.

The United States Navy decommissioned its last &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; destroyer, &quot;Goldsborough&quot;, on 29 April 1993. The Australian and German navies decommissioned their last ships of this class by 2003. Four ships of this class were transferred to the Hellenic Navy in 1992, but those have also been decommissioned.

 was originally planned to open as a museum ship sometime in 2018, but those plans were put on hold and the ship was sent to be scrapped in 2020. The was made into a museum ship, but all of the other destroyers in the class have been sunk as targets, sunk for diving wrecks or sold for scrap.

==Ships in class==
==Hellenic Navy==
Four destroyers were transferred to the Hellenic Navy;

The was a modification of the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class for the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (the Navy of West Germany). It differed from the &quot;Charles F.

==&quot;Perth&quot; class==
The Royal Australian Navy had three &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class units constructed to their own specifications (these ships were designated the ). Although broadly similar to the US Navy&#x27;s vessels, the Australian ships were fitted with the Ikara system instead of the ASROC that was fitted to the American units. The three ships were:

<text>Kabardian (), also known as , is a Northwest Caucasian language, that is considered to be the east dialect of Adyghe language. While some Soviet linguists have treated the two as distinct languages, the Circassians (including Kabardian people) consider the eastern and western language variants to be dialects of one Circassian language.

It is spoken mainly in parts of the North Caucasus republics of Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia (Eastern Circassia), and in Turkey, Jordan and Syria (the extensive post-war diaspora). It has 47 or 48 consonant phonemes, of which 22 or 23 are fricatives, depending upon whether one counts as phonemic, but it has only 3 phonemic vowels. It is one of very few languages to possess a clear phonemic distinction between ejective affricates and ejective fricatives.

Some linguists argue that Kabardian is only one dialect of an overarching Adyghe or Circassian language, which consists of all of the dialects of Adyghe and Kabardian together, and the Kabardians themselves most often refer to their language using the Circassian term &quot;Adighabze&quot; (&quot;Adyghe language&quot;). Several linguists, including Georges Dumézil, have used the terms &quot;eastern Circassian&quot; (Kabardian) and &quot;western Circassian&quot; (Adyghe) to avoid that confusion, but both &quot;Circassian&quot; and &quot;Kabardian&quot; may still be found in linguistic literature. There are several key phonetic and lexical differences that create a reasonably well-defined separation between the eastern and the western Circassian dialects, but the degree to which the two are mutually intelligible has not yet been determined. The matter is also complicated somewhat by the existence of Besleney, which is usually considered a dialect of Kabardian but also shares many features with certain dialects of Adyghe.

Kabardian is written in a form of Cyrillic and serves as the literary language for Circassians in both Kabardino-Balkaria (where it is usually called the &quot;Kabardian language&quot;) and Karachay-Cherkessia (where it is called the &quot;Cherkess language&quot;).

Like all other Northwest Caucasian languages, Kabardian is ergative and has an extremely complex verbal system.

Since 2004, the Turkish broadcasting corporation TRT has maintained a half-an-hour programme a week in the Terek dialect of Kabardian.

== Phonology ==

The phoneme written &quot;Л л&quot; is pronounced as a voiced alveolar lateral fricative mostly by the Circassians of Kabarda and Cherkessia, but many Kabardians pronounce it as an alveolar lateral approximant in diaspora. The series of labialized alveolar sibilant affricates and fricatives that exist in Adyghe became labiodental consonants in Kabardian, for example the Kabardian words &quot;мафӏэ&quot; &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;зэвы&quot; &quot;narrow&quot;, &quot;фыз&quot; &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;вакъэ&quot; &quot;shoe&quot; are pronounced as &quot;машӏо&quot; , &quot;зэжъу&quot; , &quot;шъуз&quot; and &quot;цуакъэ&quot; in Adyghe. Kabardian has a labialized voiceless velar fricative which correspond to Adyghe , for example the Adyghe word &quot;тфы&quot; ( &quot;five&quot; is тху () in Kabardian. In the Beslenei dialect, there exists an alveolar lateral ejective affricate which corresponds to in literary Kabardian. The Turkish Kabardians (Uzunyayla) and Besleneys have a palatalized voiced velar stop and a palatalized velar ejective which corresponds to and in literary Kabardian.

===Consonants===

# In some Kabardian dialects (e.g. Baslaney dialect, Uzunyayla dialect), there is a palatalized voiced velar stop and a palatalized velar ejective that were merged with and in most Kabardian dialects. For example, the Baslaney words &quot;гьанэ&quot; &quot;shirt&quot; and &quot;кӏьапсэ&quot; &quot;rope&quot; are pronounced in other Kabardian dialects as &quot;джанэ&quot; and кӏапсэ .
# Consonants that exist only in borrowed words.

The glottalization of the ejective stops (but not fricatives) can be quite weak, and has been reported to often be creaky voice, that is, to have laryngealized voicing. Something similar seems to have happened historically in the Veinakh languages.

===Vowels===
Kabardian has a vertical vowel system. Although many surface vowels appear, they can be analyzed as consisting of at most the following three phonemic vowels: , and .

The following allophones of the short vowels , appear:

According to Kuipers,
:These symbols must be understood as each covering a wide range of sub-variants. For example, i stands for a sound close to cardinal in &#x27;ji&#x27; &quot;eight&quot;, for a sound close to English in &quot;kit&quot; in the word &quot;x&#x27;i&quot; &quot;sea&quot;, etc. In fact, the short vowels, which are found only after consonants, have different variants after practically every series defined as to point of articulation and presence or absence of labialization or palatalization, and the number of variants is multiplied by the influence of the consonant (or zero) that follows.

Most of the long vowels appear as automatic variants of a sequence of short vowel and glide, when it occurs in a single syllable:
* = 
* = 

This leaves only the vowel . Kuipers claims that this can be analyzed as underlying when word-initial, and underlying elsewhere, based on the following facts:
* occurs only in the plural suffix , which does not occur word-initially.
* is the only word-initial vowel; analyzing it as makes the language underlyingly universally consonant-initial.
*Certain complications involving stress and morphophonemic alternations are dramatically simplified by these assumptions.

Halle finds Kuipers&#x27; analysis &quot;exemplary&quot;. Gordon and Applebaum note this analysis, but also note that some authors disagree, and as a result prefer to maintain a phoneme .

In a later section of his monograph, Kuipers also attempts to analyze the two vowels phonemes and out of existence. Halle, however, shows that this analysis is flawed, as it requires the introduction of multiple new phonemes to carry the information formerly encoded by the two vowel phonemes.

The vowel appears in some loan words; it is often pronounced .

The diphthong is pronounced in some dialects. may be realised as , as and as . This monophthongisation does not occur in all dialects.

The vowels can have the semi-vowel in front of it.

==Orthography==

The official alphabet used for writing Kabardian, is Cyrillic alphabet, including additional letters, totalling 59 letters. Digraphs, trigraphs, and one tetragraph, are counted as independent letters on their own. The Cyrillic alphabet in its current form has been the official alphabet since 1938. Kabardian alphabet, while having minor differences reflecting dialectical variations, is very similar to orthography of the Adyghe language, the other prominent Circassian language.

Kabardian is also unofficially written and taught in Latin, in some diaspora communities, especially in Turkey where government-backing of a Latin-based script has been a cause for controversy and opposition among Kabardians who still overwhelmingly favor Cyrillic.

===History===

Prior to the 19th century, Kabardian did not have a literary tradition yet, and it did not have a native orthography. At the time, Ottoman Turkish was used as the literary language by Circassians. Starting in the 1820s, efforts at compiling and standardizing Arabic-based scripts were undertaken by various Kabardian literaturists, and by the early 1920s, an officially-adopted Perso-Arabic-based script was in widespread educational and literary use. However, in 1924, Kabardian Arabic alphabet was discarded and replaced with Latin.. A second version of Latin script was adopted in 1930. This lasted for another 6 years, and in 1936, Latin alphabet was discarded in favour of Cyrillic. Kabardian Cyrillic alphabet underwent an iteration of modification in 1938, and the 1938 version has been in popular and official use ever since.

First ever notable attempt at compiling an orthography for Kabardian was conducted by famous Kabardian poet, Sh. Nogma, in 1825. His alphabet consisted of 42 letters, including 15 letters introduced by him, some of which had unusual forms, diverging from the conventional &quot;rasm&quot; (base of letters which are then used for addition of dots and diacritics). His alphabet thus did not take hold.

In 1830, in collaboration with Russian philologist and orientalist, , Nogma developed a Cyrillic-based script for Kabardian.

Over the decades, the popularity in use of Arabic-derived script increased. In 1881, the poet compiled a standardized Perso-Arabic script for Kabardian consisting of 39 letters. He published various literature and wrote poetry in this version of the alphabet. The Arabic alphabet was gaining universal acceptance and increasing usage among Kabardian Circassians.

In 1908, Nuri Tsagov compiled another iteration of the Perso-Arabic alphabet, better suited for all consonant and vowel phonemes of Kabardian. This version of the alphabet was widely accepted, with many authors utilizing it to publish books and literature, including a primer. The alphabet gained official status in education and later also inspired the standardization of Arabic-based orthography for Adyghe language by Akhmetov Bekukh.

In line with the general linguistic policy of the Soviet Union at the time, the existing Perso-Arabic script was replaced with a newly developed Kabardian Latin alphabet in 1924. Khuranov is credited for first compiling the first version of Latin alphabet in May 1923. This version closely resembled the Latin alphabet adopted for Adyghe language in 1927. This alphabet consisted of many newly created letters, some even borrowed from Cyrillic. Another interesting feature of this iteration of Adyghe Latin Alphabet was that there was no distinction between lower case and upper case letters. Each letter only had one single case. The alphabet consisted of а b w d g ꜧ е ӡ z ž ⱬ i j k ⱪ q qh l lh m n o p ph r s š ş t th v f fh x х̌ ɦ c ç ch y h u è ù â ỳ.

Kabardian Latin alphabet underwent another update in 1925. In this version, many of the newly created letters were removed in favour of introduction of accents and diacritics over base Latin letters. In this version, upper-case/lower-case distinction was reintroduced. The alphabet consisted of the following letters: A a, B b, V v, D d, E e, G g, Gu gu, Z z, Ž ž, Z̧ z̧, Ӡ ӡ, Ꜧ ꜧ, Ꜧu ꜧu, I i, J j, K k, Ku ku, Ⱪ ⱪ, Ⱪu ⱪu, Q q, Qu qu, Qh qh, Qhu qhu, L l, , Lh lh, M m, N n, O o, P p, Ph ph, R r, S s, Š š, Ş ş, T t, Th th, U u, F f, Fh fh, X x, Xu xu, X̌ x̌, X̌u x̌u, ɦ, C c, Ç ç, Ch ch, Y y, H h, &#x27;, Ù ù, Je je, Jo jo, Ju ju, Ja ja.

In 1930, the Kabardian Latin alphabet was replaced by a new version derived from the nationally-adopted new standard, Yañalif.

In 1936, Kabardian was one of the languages in the Soviet Union to switch to Cyrillic alphabet. , Kabardian public figure and linguist is credited with the compilation of the first official Cyrillic alphabet for Kabardian. They consisted of the following: А а, &#x27;А &#x27;а, Б б, В в, Г г, Гъ гъ, Д д, Е е, Ж ж, Жь жь, З з, И и, Й й, К к, К&#x27; к&#x27;, Л л, Ль ль, Л&#x27; л&#x27;, М м, Н н, О о, П п, П&#x27; п&#x27;, Р р, С с, Т т, Т&#x27; т&#x27;, У у, &#x27;У &#x27;у, Ф ф, Ф&#x27; ф&#x27;, Х х, Хь хь, Хъ хъ, Ц ц, Ц&#x27; ц&#x27;, Ч ч, Ш ш, Щ щ, Щ&#x27; щ&#x27;, Ъ ъ, Ы ы, Ь ь, Э э, Ю ю, Я я. The extensive reliance on use of apostrophes made the alphabet inconvenient to learn and use. Thus two years later, in 1938, led a commission that reformed the Cyrillic alphabet to its present form.

Among the diasporic Circassian communities, the situation with respect to orthography has been more complex. Some groups have advocated for use of Latin or Arabic in line with the language of the larger society in which Circassian communities reside. On the other hand, since the adoption of Cyrillic in Circassia others have advocated for continued use of Cyrillic as it helps maintain contact with the Circassian homeland and the literary tradition there. This divergence goes back to the early 20th century, when in 1909, Muhammad Pchegatlukov developed a new and independent Arabic-based writing system in the Ottoman Empire. His proposed script did not manage to displace the main orthography of the time in the Circassian homeland, i.e. Nuri Tsagov&#x27;s script.

More recently, there has been developments in Turkey. In the 2000s, the Konya-based Adyghe Language Teaching Association (ADDER) has compiled a Latin alphabet for Kabardian. While many in the Circassian community have opposed the move, the endorsement of the project by Turkey&#x27;s ruling party, AK Party, has resulted in the boosting of ADDER script and its usage in development of new educational material. The alphabet consists of the following letters:A a, B b, C c, Ç ç, Ć ć, D d, E e, É é, F f, Ḟ ḟ, G g, Ǵ ǵ, Ğ ğ, H h, Ḣ ḣ, I ı, İ i, J j, Ĵ ĵ, K k, Ḱ ḱ, Ǩ ǩ, L l, Ĺ ĺ, M m, N n, O o, Ö ö, P p, Ṕ ṕ, Q q, R r, S s, Ś ś, Š š, Ş ş, Ṩ ṩ, T t, Ṫ ṫ, U u, Ü ü, W w, V v, X x, Y y, Z z, Ź ź, &#x27; 


===Kabardian Cyrillic alphabet===

The table below lists the 59-letter Kabardian Cyrillic alphabet. Dighraphs, trigraphs, and a tetragraph are counted as independent letters.

===ADDER Latin alphabet===

Since the genocide and forced expulsion of Circassians in their homeland in the second half of the 19th century, most Circassians have been living as diaspora communities in countries such as Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and elsewhere. In fact, more Circassians live in the diaspora than within Circassia. As far as orthographic conventions among diasporic communities is concerned, a majority of diaspora Circasians have tried to follow the conventions and literary practices in place among people living in the Circassian homeland. This is to help diaspora communities maintain ties to their homeland. Therefore, before 1924, the Arabic-based scripts developed for Western and Eastern (Kabardian) Circassian, also took roots among the diaspora communities. This is also why for the past decades up till today, the majority of Circassians, be they in Turkey or Jordan or elsewhere, have adopted the Cyrillic alphabet and insist on educating the new generation in Cyrillic alphabet.

Nevertheless, the issue of orthography has not been without controversy among diaspora communities. In the 2000s in Turkey, the Konya-based Adyghe Language Teaching Association (ADDER) has compiled a Latin alphabet for Kabardian. While many in the Circassian community have opposed the move, the endorsement of the project by Turkey&#x27;s ruling party, AK Party, has resulted in the boosting of ADDER script. Since then, government-endorsed education material and primers have been prepared in ADDER Latin script.

Table below lists the 49-letter Kabardian Latin (ADDER) alphabet and their respective Cyrillic equivalents. Highlighted letters are not considered independent letters, but are digraphs and are used to correspond to specific Kabardian phonemes.

===Kabardian Arabic alphabet===

Below table shows Kabardian Perso-Arabic alphabet, as it was the official script of Kabardian Circassian between 1908 and 1924, compiled by Nuri Tsagov.

== Grammar ==

Kabardian, like all Northwest Caucasian languages, has a basic agent–object–verb typology, and is characterized by ergative–absolutive alignment.

<doc id="538365" wikidata="Q2891835" url="?curid=538365" title="Señor Wences">
<text>Wenceslao Moreno Centeno (April 17, 1896 – April 20, 1999), known professionally as Señor Wences (), was a Spanish ventriloquist and comedian. His popularity grew with his frequent television appearances on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; during the 1950s and 1960s. Later, he became popular with another generation of fans on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

==Early life==
Wenceslao Moreno Centeno was born in Peñaranda de Bracamonte, Salamanca. His mother was Josefa Centeno Lavera and his father was Antonio Moreno Ros. His mother was born in the province of Salamanca. His family on both sides were Roman Catholic. 

At age 15 he learned how to juggle. He then joined a circus act of some friends.

Throughout his career, he maintained a residence in Salamanca, vacationing there every summer. He became one of the benefactors of the Convent of Saint Teresa of Avila (1515–1582) in Alba de Tormes, Salamanca, at which he attended Mass every Sunday when there. The street that leads to the convent received the name of Señor Wences while he was alive. Several other places in Salamanca and in Castille have streets named for him.

==Career==
Performing under the stage name &quot;Señor Wences&quot;, Moreno was known for his speed, skill, and grace as a ventriloquist. His stable of characters included &quot;Johnny&quot;, a childlike face drawn on his hand, placed atop an otherwise headless doll, with whom the ventriloquist conversed while switching voices between Johnny&#x27;s falsetto and his own voice with great speed. He opened his act by drawing Johnny&#x27;s face on his hand, on stage. He would first place his thumb next to, and in front of, his bent first finger; the first finger would be the upper lip, and the thumb the lower lip. He used lipstick to draw the lips onto the respective fingers and then drew eyes onto the upper part of the first finger, finishing the effect with a tiny long-haired wig on top of his hand. Flexing the thumb would move the &quot;lips&quot;. Moreno performed a scene using Johnny in the 1947 musical &quot;Mother Wore Tights.&quot; The inspiration for Johnny came from his school days when the teacher punished him for imitating classmates and answering &quot;present&quot; when they were absent. His punishment was to clean the inkwells and he smeared some of the ink on his hand, then clenched his fist to create the face.

Another popular Señor Wences character was the gruff-voiced &quot;Pedro&quot;, a disembodied head in a box. Señor Wences was forced suddenly to invent the character when his regular, full-sized dummy was destroyed during a 1936 train accident en route to Chicago. Pedro would either &quot;speak&quot; from within the closed box, or speak with moving lipssimply answering &quot;s&#x27;awright&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s all right&quot;)when the performer opened the box&#x27;s front panel with his free hand to ask questions of Pedro. A large part of the entertainer&#x27;s comedy lay in the well-timed, high-speed exchange of dialogue between him and his creations, because of the difference in their voice pitches.

Part of his act involved throwing his voice while his mouth was otherwise engaged (i.e., smoking or drinking), and rapidly switching between multiple voices. Another favorite prop was a telephone, with the ventriloquist playing both sides of a telephone conversation. For the &quot;caller&quot; he simulated a &quot;filtered&quot; voice, as it would sound over a telephone wire to a bystander. This voice always began a conversation with a shouted &quot;Moreno?&quot;using the true surname of Señor Wences, who would respond &quot;No, Moreno is not here.&quot;

He usually built up to a big finish that combined ventriloquism with juggling and plate-spinning. As he performed his routines, Pedro and Johnny would heckle him.
Although he was an international favorite for decades, his main career was made in the United States, where he arrived in 1934 or 1935. In addition to live performances at nightclubs, he appeared regularly on television variety shows, including frequent appearances on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, where he was a guest 48 times. He also performed on Broadway, in Las Vegas casino theaters, in feature films, and made an appearance on The Dusty Springfield Show in 1966.

Much later in his career he was introduced to a new generation of fans when he was a featured guest during season 5 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. He also made a 1982 appearance on &quot;Late night with David Letterman&quot;. In the early 1980s, a Tri-state Honda dealer&#x27;s commercial featured Señor Wences with Johnny. Pedro&#x27;s &quot;s&#x27;awright&quot; was a voice from the elaborate glovebox. Señor Wences would point out all of the features of the automobile to which Johnny would reply, &quot;Ees Standard&quot;, &quot;Stan-dard!&quot;, and &quot;Nice!&quot; This may have been the final commercial appearance of Señor Wences. It was shot in Puerto Rico because its star declined to travel to New York. Tony Belmont, at the time the president of Alan Freed Productions, was his agent and manager throughout the 1980s, and he secured Señor Wences a spot performing at Ruth Eckerd Hall, among many others. In 1986, he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Garry Shandling Show&quot;. His last television appearance was on &quot;The Very Best of the Ed Sullivan Show #2&quot;, a retrospective in which the nonagenarian talked about &quot;Suliban&quot; and performed a brief spot of ventriloquism.

He pronounced his professional name using traditional Castilian, which in English sounds like &quot;WEN-thess&quot;. After Sullivan would announce him, mispronouncing his name as &quot;Señor Wen-sess&quot;, the ventriloquist would correct Sullivan&#x27;s pronunciation subtly, by introducing himself to the audience: &quot;Hello, I am Señor Wen-thess&quot;.

In 2009 Señor Wences was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary &quot;I&#x27;m No Dummy&quot;, directed by Bryan W. Simon.

===Catchphrases===
One of the Señor Wences trademark bits of shtick (referenced several times below) involved his dialogue with a deep voice emanating from inside a box. At the opening of the dialogue he would shout, &quot;Hello in the box!&quot; At the conclusion of the dialogue, he would open the lid of the box and ask &quot;S&#x27;ok?&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s ok?&quot;) and the box voice would answer &quot;S&#x27;ariiight!&quot; immediately after which Señor Wences would shut the lid of the box. In 1959, the phrase was adapted for use in the closing credits for the Hanna-Barbera cartoon show Quick Draw McGraw where sidekick Baba Looey, trapped inside a chest, falls off a stagecoach driven by Quick-Draw whose shout &quot;Hey Baba Looey&quot; is met by the response &quot;S&#x27;awright&quot;.

Another routine involved explaining to his hand puppet Johnny that something was easy (or difficult) to do, to which the puppet always would reply the contrary, such as, &quot;Easy for you, for me ees very deefeecult!&quot; in his Spanish accent. These catchphrases were incorporated into a record Señor Wences released in 1959 by Joy Records (New York), featuring the songs &quot;S-All Right? S-All Right&quot; and &quot;Deefeecult For YouEasy For Me&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Moreno received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the US National Comedy Hall of Fame in 1996. The ceremony was immortalized via video through the National Comedy Hall of Fame.

Despite his retirement by age 100, the famous Señor Wences puppets, Johnny and Pedro, &quot;continued working&quot;. Ventriloquists Jay Johnson, Rickie Layne, and Michele LaFong performed at Moreno&#x27;s 100th birthday celebration at the New York Friars&#x27; Club (where he was made a lifetime member), and he was so impressed with LaFong that he befriended her. Not only did he give his puppets to her, but he also taught her how to perform his classic routines. Las Vegas headliner Michele LaFong continued to perform Señor Wences routines after the performer&#x27;s death, using some of the original characters. Another famous ventriloquist who was present at Señor Wences&#x27; birthday party, and who met him there for the first time, was Paul Winchell.

Moreno died on April 20, 1999, three days after his 103rd birthday. He had been residing in Midtown Manhattan on 54th Street, just around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater. That section of 54th Street has been named Señor Wences Way. His portrait can be seen at the Players Club in New York.

<doc id="538368" wikidata="Q618532" url="?curid=538368" title="Landlord">
<text>A landlord is the owner of a house, apartment, condominium, land, or real estate which is rented or leased to an individual or business, who is called a tenant (also a &quot;lessee&quot; or &quot;renter&quot;). When a juristic person is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include lessor and owner. The term landlady may be used for the female owners. The manager of a pub in the United Kingdom, strictly speaking a licensed victualler, is referred to as the landlord/landlady. In political economy it refers to the owner of natural resources alone (e.g., land, not buildings) from which an economic rent, a form of passive income, is the income received.

==History==
The concept of a landlord may be traced back to the feudal system of manoralism (seignorialism), where a landed estate is owned by a Lord of the Manor (mesne lords), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of knights in the high medieval period, holding their fief via subinfeudation, but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the royal domain directly owned by a king, or in the Holy Roman Empire imperial villages directly subject to the emperor. The medieval system ultimately continues the system of villas and latifundia (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the Roman Empire. In modern times, &quot;landlord&quot; describes an owner of a property who charges rent to a person.

==Owner and tenant responsibilities==
A rental agreement, or &quot;lease&quot;, is the contract defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement. In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.

Many owners hire a property management company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases or licence agreements, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.

===United States===
In the United States, residential homeowner–tenant disputes are primarily governed by state law (not federal law) regarding property and contracts. State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for eviction of a tenant. Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and states have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or rent regulation, and related eviction. There is also an implied warranty of habitability, whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door. The most common disputes result from either the landlord&#x27;s failure to provide services or the tenant&#x27;s failure to pay rent—the former can also lead to the latter. The withholding of rent is justifiable cause for eviction, as often explained in the lease. City ordinances can also play a role in renting policy, such as the rise in source-of-income anti-discrimination ordinances. Tenants unions also affect housing policy when organized politically.

===Canada===
In Canada, residential homeowner–tenant disputes are primarily governed by provincial law (not federal law) regarding property and contracts. Provincial law sets the requirements for eviction of a tenant. Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or rent regulation, and related eviction. There is also an implied warranty of habitability, whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.

===United Kingdom===
====Residential rental market (tenancies)====
Private sector renting is largely governed by many of the Landlord and Tenant Acts, in particular the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 which sets bare minimum standards in tenants&#x27; rights against their landlords. Another key statute is the Housing Act 2004. Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the assured shorthold tenancy (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court&#x27;s discretion after serving the tenant with a Section 8 notice (under the Housing Act 1988 as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies, and on other grounds which defer to the landlord&#x27;s ownership of the property. If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy. A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a &quot;regulated tenancy&quot; with many more rights, especially under the Rent Act 1977 and Protection from Eviction Act 1977, introduced by the Third Wilson ministry.

Each house in multiple occupation, a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the Housing Act 2004. A council-issued licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).

====Residential leasehold====
Tenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be lengthy; if more than seven years a new leasehold estate must be registered. These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general. They seldom require a sizeable ground rent. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted. Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the Right to Manage, and the right to buy the landlord&#x27;s interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (&quot;premium&quot;), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15–35 years. Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is &quot;reasonable&quot; vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the &quot;statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation&quot;.

In the overall diminishing domain of social housing, exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the Right to Buy for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.

====Commercial (business) leases and tenancies====
In commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the common law including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of &quot;good and substantial repair&quot;. Implied principles include &quot;non-derogation from grant&quot; and &quot;quiet enjoyment&quot;. All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 which gives them &quot;business security of tenure&quot;. If not, it generally applies by default. This &quot;security of tenure&quot; is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises. If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the right of first refusal at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord&#x27;s repossession (&quot;peaceable re-entry&quot;) through a commercial landlord&#x27;s right to the use of &quot;self-help&quot; evictions. The taking of a tenant&#x27;s goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) (distress) has been banned.

== Criticism of landlords ==
=== Land ownership ===
The concept of land ownership is not universal. Many Native American tribes did not view land as a commodity whereas many Europeans colonists did. Ownership of land in the pre-colonial Americas varied from group to group, but many Native American societies had communal and individual land.

Some European scholars were also skeptical of land ownership, such as Adam Smith and Henry George. Smith said about landlords, &quot;As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords—like all other men—love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for their land’s natural product.&quot; George believed land belonged to everyone and supported a public tax on economic rent, which he believed would be so profitable that all other taxes would be abolished.

=== Monopolies ===
Another common criticism of landlords is the tendency for monopolization. Without regulation, corporations are able to use their purchasing power to buy up housing stock. In a single Atlanta zip code, up to 90% of the houses sold between January 2011 and June 2012 were purchased by instituitional investors. Corporate landlords are able to buy foreclosed houses and rent the house back to the original owner. Another form of corporate monopolization and housing are company towns, where one corporation owns the vast majority of housing and businesses. Since these corporations employ most of the residents of the town, they are able to raise rent and lower wages during a recession.

=== Slum landlord ===

Renters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and suffer significant social stigma as a consequence. Due to lack of alternative options, such renters are often the victims of unscrupulous owners of unsafe and decrepit properties who neglect their responsibility to maintain the property.

The terms &quot;slumlord&quot;, &quot;slum landlord&quot;, or &quot;ghetto landlord&quot; is used to describe landlords of large numbers of such properties, often holding a virtual local monopoly. Public improvement or major private investment can improve such areas. In extreme situations, government compulsory purchase powers in many countries enable slum clearance to replace or renovate the worst of neighbourhoods.

==Accidental landlord==
The term &#x27;accidental landlord&#x27; is used for landlords who do not initially intend to become a landlord but have a spare property (from inheriting it, moving in with a partner, or unable to sell when moving), and then choose to lease the property instead of selling it.

==Rental investment and basis==
===Incentives and disincentives===
The incentive is to obtain a good rental yield (profit) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying rights of tenants and duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration — and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance unavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment). Net income (yield) and capital growth from letting (renting out) particularly in leveraged buy to let, is subject to idiosyncratic risk, which is considered objectively intensified for a highly leveraged investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.

===Security for rent and extra fees===

A landlord or their agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in/administration fee). A barrier if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead, a landlord&#x27;s loss of rent/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent demanded and/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible. A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean/repair by the tenant.

==Licensed victualler==
In the United Kingdom the owner and/or manager of a pub (public house) is usually called the &quot;landlord/landlady&quot; or &quot;publican&quot;, the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or tax farmer. In more formal situations, the term used is licensed victualler or simply &quot;licensee&quot;.

The Licensed Trade Charity, formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler&#x27;s National Homes, exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain&#x27;s pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in Ascot and Reading in Berkshire and Sayers Common in Sussex. As well as having normal full fee paying students, Licensed Victuallers&#x27; School in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.

==Landlord associations==
There are significant associations of landlords in various countries. These associations/societies provide support for their members in facing a range of issues 
by providing a means of mutual support, and also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation of residential and some commercial tenancy legislation.

===Australia===
Numerous landlord associations exist in Australia. These associations should be distinguished from the class of property owner associations representing the &#x27;big end of town&#x27; — the owners of major buildings and very large residential housing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.

* Property Owners Association of Australia (POAA)
* Property Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC)
* POAQ – Property Owners Association of Queensland
* Property Owners Association of NSW
* Property Owners Association of Western Australia
* Landlords Association of South Australia

===United Kingdom===
National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) has now formed from a merger of the two following organisations as of 31/3/2020:

* Residential Landlords Association (RLA)
* National Landlords Association (NLA)

<doc id="538375" wikidata="Q1781317" url="?curid=538375" title="Orange Juice (band)">
<text>Orange Juice were a Scottish jangle pop band founded in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden as the Nu-Sonics in 1976. They became Orange Juice in 1979, and took inspiration by contemporary punk bands including Subway Sect, Television, and Buzzcocks but also 1960s acts, most notably the Byrds and the Velvet Underground. Musically, the band brought together styles and genres that often appeared incongruous, for example, country, disco and punk.

The band released their first singles during 1980 and 1981 on the independent Postcard Records label founded by Alan Horne, along with fellow Scottish bands Josef K and Aztec Camera. Orange Juice&#x27;s &#x27;neo acoustic&#x27;, jangly guitar sound – as evident in singles including &quot;Blue Boy&quot; and &quot;Simply Thrilled Honey&quot; – came to define &#x27;The Postcard Sound&#x27; that directly influenced acts as diverse as the Bluebells, Haircut One Hundred and the Smiths.

Despite their association with the independent scene, the band signed to the major label Polydor Records in 1981 and recorded their first album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide Your Love Forever&quot; for them. However, internal tensions led to splits in the band in late 1981, with their second album, released in late 1982, showing more pop sensibilities and combining their guitar-based sound with disco influences. The band&#x27;s only top 40 hit, &quot;Rip It Up&quot; was achieved with the aid of the synthesizer – it was the first hit to use the Roland TB-303. &quot;Rip It Up&quot; reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1983. Subsequent singles failed to chart as highly, but the band continued to be critically acclaimed, finally splitting up in January 1985 after a gig for the UK miners&#x27; strike. Their three albums have been subsequently reissued and remastered on several occasions, with a major career-spanning box set &quot;Coals to Newcastle&quot; released in 2010.

Edwyn Collins pursued a successful solo career following the band&#x27;s split, whilst other members James Kirk, David McClymont, Malcolm Ross and Zeke Manyika have had lower-profile solo releases. The original line-up of the band reunited once in 2008 to be honoured for their influence on Scottish music, but the band has never reformed.

==History==
===Origins: The Nu Sonics===
Orange Juice had their origin in the Nu Sonics, formed by Edwyn Collins with college friend Alan Duncan (on bass) in 1976: the band was named after the affordable Burns nu-sonic guitar used by Collins. Two students in the year below them – Steven Daly and James Kirk, previously in punk band, The Machetes – were drafted into the band in 1977, with a fifth member, Geoff Taylor, playing drums. A first gig was held in the Silver Thread in Paisley in November 1977, with Daly on lead vocals. Daly subsequently shifted to drums, and further local gigs followed as a four-piece, including one supporting Steel Pulse at Satellite City in January 1978, alongside Johnny and the Self-Abusers, later to be known as Simple Minds. Duncan left the band after a gig at Hardgate Town Hall, leaving the remaining members to search for a new bass player.

===The Postcard years===
Shortly after Duncan&#x27;s departure, one of Collins&#x27; colleagues in the Glasgow Parks Department, David McClymont, joined the band on bass, and the band was rechristened as Orange Juice. Collins, Kirk, McClymont and Daly&#x27;s first gig as Orange Juice occurred in April 1979 in the Glasgow School of Art refectory. At another early gig at Teviot Row House at the University of Edinburgh was recorded by Malcolm Ross of Josef K, and one track from this (Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Felicity&quot;) was pressed as a flexi-disc to be distributed with a planned fanzine to be called &quot;&#x27;Strawberry Switchblade&quot;&#x27;, a name that later inspired and was adopted for a band formed by friends of the group and notably Alan Horne, the manager of Postcard Records. Horne planned the fanzine with Collins in 1979 primarily as a conduit to release Orange Juice&#x27;s music. The fanzine never appeared, though some copies of the flexi were given away in the &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; fanzine run by Robert Hodgens (of the Bluebells).

Daly left shortly after the Teviot Row gig, joining local punk act Fun 4. Daly was replaced in Orange Juice by Chris Gordon on drums, but was persuaded back to record the band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Falling and Laughing&quot; for Postcard after Gordon suffered from stage fright at a number of gigs. The debut single was recorded in December 1979 in Strathaven, with Malcolm Ross co-producing and adding guitar to both the A-side and the playful and instrumental B-side &quot;Moscow&quot;, the latter recorded as a tentative &#x27;theme tune&#x27; for the coming 1980 Moscow Olympics. Fewer than 1,000 copies of &quot;Falling and Laughing&quot; were pressed, and most included copies of the &quot;Felicity&quot; flexi: 200 also included a postcard of the band. The wrap-round cover and amateur packaging established Postcard&#x27;s home-spun aesthetic, with the label&#x27;s &quot;Sound of Young Scotland&quot; tagline marking it out as something of a reaction to much of the seriousness and angst of post-punk. Released in February 1980, &quot;Falling and Laughing&quot; was Postcard&#x27;s signature tune: lyrically and musically, it celebrated the innocence of youth and was very much at odds with much contemporary independent music, combining a disco bass-line purloined from an ELO song with jangly guitars reminiscent of the Velvet Underground.

&quot;Falling and Laughing&quot; immediately marked out Postcard Records as a label to watch, and subsequent releases by Josef K and Aztec Camera consolidated its reputation as being at the cutting-edge of a new wave of Scottish pop. But it was Orange Juice that came to embody the &quot;Sound of Young Scotland&quot;, with Collins&#x27; on-stage behaviour, charity-shop chic and occasional self-parody combining camp aesthetics with a subversive rejection of macho rock and roll cliché. Live, performances could be shambolic, with guitars often out of tune, and songs often aborted as drums, bass and guitar raced away from each other. Occasionally, crowds were hostile towards the band, seeing them as effeminate and anti-rock. Nonetheless, gigs in Glasgow and then Edinburgh began to attract a sizable fan-base: notable gigs with Josef K were sold as &#x27;Postcard&#x27; nights, including the infamous &#x27;Funky Glasgow Now&#x27; show at Glasgow Technical College in April 1980.

The band&#x27;s debut single was followed by a series of well-received Postcard 7&quot; releases: &quot;Blue Boy&quot;, &quot;Simply Thrilled Honey&quot; and &quot;Poor Old&quot; Soul in 1980 and 1981. Selling sufficiently to appear prominently in the independent charts, these garnered considerable interest from the London-based music press, much of which appeared charmed by the band&#x27;s on-stage antics. Invitations to record two sessions for Radio One DJ&#x27;s John Peel followed, and, in the autumn of 1980, the band was invited on a national tour by Peel-favourites The Undertones, gaining further exposure. One of these gigs was at Rock City in Nottingham: coming on as support band, Orange Juice became the first band to play this now-legendary venue (on 11 Dec 1980).

Demos for an album on Postcard were completed in a single day at Hellfire Studios in Glasgow in 1981, with the working title &quot;Ostrich Churchyard&quot;. Seeking better distribution to get the debut album to a larger audience, Postcard approached Rough Trade Records with these demos, with Rough Trade agreeing to fund recording sessions in London in the summer of 1981, promising to distribute the debut album whilst allowing Postcard to retain artistic freedom. The album was recorded in Regent&#x27;s Park Studios in London in August 1981, under the auspices of Scritti Politti producer Adam Kidron, who sought to augment the band&#x27;s guitar-based sound with backing singers, horns and keyboards, emulating the sound that had made Scritti&#x27;s &quot;The &quot;Sweetest Girl&quot;&quot; a modest crossover hit. Afterwards, Orange Juice took the tapes from these sessions and signed to Polydor, hastening the demise of Postcard (with a scheduled fifth Orange Juice single on Postcard, &quot;Wan Light&quot;, failing to ever see the light of day). The Postcard Records-era history of Orange Juice is featured in the 2015 documentary film &quot;Big Gold Dream&quot;.

===Debut album===
Debut album &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide Your Love Forever&quot; was not released until February 1982, and received mixed reviews, with the use of backing singers and synthesizers anathema to some of the band&#x27;s long-term fans. Retrospectively, however, the album is often cited as a classic of the era and a key influence on the C86 generation and beyond. By the stage the album was released, the band in any case had a new line-up: in August 1981, Josef K split up, with Collins asking guitarist Malcolm Ross to join the band, making it a five-piece. This caused some ructions, with Daly and Kirk reportedly feeling the band was losing its original sound (Daly in particularly having publicly objected to the first Polydor single &quot;L.O.V.E... Love&quot;, a cover of the Al Green classic, released in October 1981). Collins was reported in the press as siding with Kirk and Daly before deciding to leave with Malcolm Ross and bass player David McClymont. Collins, Ross and McClymont performed as a three-piece, with stand-in drummers, on a couple of Autumn 1981 gigs before Zeke Manyika made his live debut in January 1982 at the London Venue. As such, the line-up that promoted &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide Your Love Forever&quot; on tour in early 1982 was not the line-up that recorded it: ignoring older material penned by James Kirk (e.g. &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Wan Light&quot;, &quot;You Old Eccentric&quot;, &quot;Three Cheers for Our Side&quot;) the band often used dates to debut new songs that overtly more pop in style, including a cover of The Staple Singers&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot;, future single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself&quot; (with its telling reference to The Four Tops), and &quot;In Spite of It All&quot;, later renamed and issued as the single &quot;Two Hearts Together&quot; in the summer of 1982. The latter single was released as a double A-side with &quot;Hokoyo&quot;, a song co-written by Zeke Manyika and featuring lyrics in Shona, showing the band moving away from its original guitar-based sound and towards a more varied and eclectic musical palette.

===&quot;Rip It Up&quot; and chart success===
Despite increasing exposure on TV and media, both of Orange Juice&#x27;s 1982 singles failed to deliver the anticipated hit. However. the album &quot;Rip It Up&quot; issued in November 1982 was to spawn the single of the same name, which reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1983. Referencing both Chic and the Buzzcocks, the single cemented Orange Juice as one of the brightest bands in the &#x27;new pop&#x27; scene. The single was promoted through two memorable &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performances, including one where bass player David McClymont appeared to fall into the crowd, apparently inebriated, gaining them a ban from the programme. DJ Janice Long championed the band, commissioning two further Radio One Sessions in March 1983 (neither commercially released, and assumed missing from the BBC archive), while magazines including &quot;Smash Hits&quot; continued to showcase the band (its editor Ian Cranna becoming the band&#x27;s manager). However, the follow-up single to &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, &quot;Flesh of My Flesh&quot;, failed to build on its success, peaking at number 41 in the spring of 1983.

===Later years===
New single &quot;Place in my Heart&quot; was scheduled for October 1983 as a teaser for an album that would come out the following month. However, both were pulled following Ross and McClymont leaving the group, citing &#x27;musical differences&#x27;: the last appearance of the four-piece Orange Juice was their open-air festival appearance at Victoria Park, Hackney 6 Aug 1984. Salvaged from the album sessions, the six-track mini-album &quot;Texas Fever&quot;, issued in March 1984, was critically feted, but failed to spawn a hit with its only single, &quot;Bridge&quot;.

From this point Orange Juice had a core line-up of Collins and Manyika, who proceeded to record Orange Juice&#x27;s final album, &quot;The Orange Juice&quot;, with Clare Kenny on bass, and with Johnny Britten on guitar and Paul Herd on bass joining the live set-up. Produced by Dennis Bovell, the album was named with reference to the third album by The Velvet Underground. Again critically acclaimed, the album&#x27;s blue-eyed soul influences presaged other 1980s Scottish acts taking inspiration from this genre, including Wet Wet Wet and Hue and Cry. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;What Presence?!&quot; was notable for a video by Derek Jarman but also failed to break into the top 40, peaking at 47, while prophetic single &quot;Lean Period&quot; just crept into the top 75. The album was promoted via &#x27;The Artisans&#x27; tour in the Autumn of 1984, with Steve Skinner replacing Britten on guitar, but by this stage venues and crowds were becoming smaller (and a final London Lyceum date in December 1984 was cancelled because of poor sales). Relations with Polydor became strained by the fact Orange Juice could not tour internationally because of Zeke Manyika&#x27;s immigration status, with the release of a third single from the album vetoed as the record label focused on other acts, to Collins&#x27; vocal disapproval. At the same time, Collins&#x27; decision to release material with former schoolfriend Paul Quinn on Alan Horne&#x27;s new Swampland Records label further soured the relationship with Polydor.

The band&#x27;s final show was in January 1985 at a gig for the UK miners&#x27; strike, where they came on as the first act (before Aztec Camera and Everything but the Girl), announcing it was their last gig to a half-empty venue. Their final song was &quot;Rock and Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life)&quot;, a cover of a Kevin Johnson song. Following the split, Manyika recorded a solo album for Polydor, who also released an Orange Juice &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; album &quot;In a Nutshell&quot; in 1985, while Collins signed for Creation Records the same year, with his solo debut single &quot;Don&#x27;t Shilly Shally&quot; released on the Creation-offshoot Elevation Records in 1986.

===Legacy===

While never enjoying prolonged commercial success, Orange Juice were to exercise considerable influence over the indie pop and indie rock scenes that followed in the UK. Most notably, commentators often noted the debt that The Smiths owed to Collins&#x27; lyrics, while a number of other later 1980s bands were to cite Orange Juice and other Postcard Records acts as an influence, with the C86 scene featuring numerous acts who either covered Orange Juice songs (such as &quot;The Wedding Present&quot;) or who borrowed elements of their sound (such as Mighty Mighty, The Chesterf!elds, The June Brides, The Bodines). 

Internationally, Orange Juice also inspired the neo-acoustic movement in Japan, with the band Flipper&#x27;s Guitar naming their 1989 debut album after one of James Kirk&#x27;s compositions, &quot;Three Cheers for Our Side&quot;.

In the 1990s, the rejuvenated Postcard Records issued a collection of the band&#x27;s early singles and in 1993 finally released the demos for the first album &quot;Ostrich Churchyard&quot; alongside a reissue of &quot;Blue Boy&quot;, while Polydor collected the best of their major releases on a new &#x27;best of&#x27; compilation, &quot;The Esteemed – The Very Best of Orange Juice&quot;.

In the 2000s, guitar bands including Franz Ferdinand, Hatcham Social, The Drums, and The Cribs proclaimed Orange Juice as an influence, triggering renewed interest in the band. Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s label, the Domino Recording Company, responded by issuing re-releases of all four Polydor albums on vinyl and CD, with a major 6 CD/DVD collection &quot;Coals to Newcastle&quot; released in 2010.

Edwyn Collins continues to perform Orange Juice songs at his live shows. Though Malcolm Ross was initially part of Collins&#x27; live band, and Kirk, Manyika, and McClymont continue to record and perform intermittently, the band has never reformed. To date, the original line-up of the band has reunited publicly just once, in 2008, when they were honoured for their influence on Scottish music by the Nordoff Robbins musical trust.

<text>Hyacinth ( or &quot;Jacek Odrowąż&quot;; – 15 August 1257) was a Polish Dominican priest and missionary who worked to reform the women&#x27;s monasteries in his native Poland. Educated in Paris and Bologna, he was a Doctor of Sacred Studies.

==Life==
Called the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;, Hyacinth was the son of Eustachius Koński of the noble family of Odrowąż. He was born in 1185 at the castle of Lanka, at Kamień, in Silesia, Poland. A near relative of Ceslaus, he made his studies in notable cities: Kraków, Prague, and Bologna, and at the latter place merited the title of Doctor of Law and Divinity. On his return to Poland he was given a prebend at Sandomierz, a medieval centre of administration in the south-eastern part of the country. He subsequently accompanied his uncle Ivo Konski, the Bishop of Kraków, to Rome.While in Rome, he witnessed a miracle performed by Dominic of Osma, and became a Dominican friar, along with Ceslaus and two attendants of the Bishop of Kraków, Herman and Henry. In 1219 Pope Honorius III invited Dominic and his followers to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Before that time, the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of San Sisto Vecchio which Honorius III had given to Dominic in about 1218, intending it to be used for a reformation of Roman nuns under Dominic&#x27;s guidance. Hyacinth and his companions were among the first to enter the convent. They were also the first alumni of the &quot;studium&quot; of the Dominican Order at Santa Sabina out of which would grow the 16th century College of Saint Thomas at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, which became the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 20th century. After an abbreviated novitiate, Hyacinth and his companions received the religious habit of the Order from Dominic himself in 1220.

The young friars were then sent back to their homeland to establish the Dominican Order in Poland and Kyiv. As Hyacinth and his three companions traveled back to Kraków, he set up new monasteries with his companions as superiors, until finally he was the only one left to continue on to Kraków. Hyacinth went throughout Northern Europe spreading the faith. He died in the year 1257. Tradition holds that he also evangelized throughout Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Prussia, Scotland, Russia, Turkey, and Greece. However, these travels are heavily disputed and are not supported by the earliest hagiographies of Hyacinth.

==Legend==

One of the major miracles attributed to Hyacinth came about during the 1240 Siege of Kiev. As the friars prepared to flee the invading forces, Hyacinth went to save the ciborium containing the Eucharist from the tabernacle in the monastery&#x27;s chapel, when he heard the voice of Mary, asking him to take her, too.

Hyacinth lifted the large, stone statue of Mary, as well as the ciborium. He was easily able to carry both, even though the statue weighed far more than he could normally lift. Thus, he saved them both. For this reason, he is usually shown holding a monstrance (though they did not come into use until several centuries later) and a statue of Mary.

The Polish exclamation &quot;Święty Jacku z pierogami!&quot; (&quot;St. Hyacinth with his dumplings!&quot;) is an old-time saying, a call for help in some hopeless circumstance. It has derived from two legends. One of them is about his visit on July 13, 1238, to Kościelec. During his visit, a hailstorm broke out, destroying crops and leaving people with the prospect of famine. Hyacinth told them to pray. The next day, the crops were miraculously restored. The people then treated Hyacinth to pierogi made from those crops as a token of gratitude. The second legend mentions Hyacinth feeding people with pierogi during a famine caused by the Mongol invasion of 1241.

==Veneration==

The tomb of Hyacinth is in the Basilica of the Holy Trinity in Kraków, Poland, in a chapel that is dedicated to him.

Hyacinth was canonized on 17 April 1594 by Pope Clement VIII, and his feast is celebrated on 17 August. In 1686 Pope Innocent XI named him a patron of Lithuania. He is the patron saint of those in danger of drowning and weight lifting.

Among notable churches in North America dedicated to Hyacinth of Poland is the Basilica of St. Hyacinth in Chicago, Illinois.

==In culture==
Kraków&#x27;s annual Pierogi Festival is held on St. Hyacinth&#x27;s feast day, and the winner receives a statuette of him.

<text>A split vote is normally used synonymously with &quot;deadlocked&quot;, &quot;hung&quot;, or &quot;evenly split&quot; vote. It indicates a vote in which no decision can be made, as neither side has the majority.

The term can be used to indicate dissent by as little as a single vote, if a unanimous vote is required.

If a casting vote is available, this may be used to break the deadlock. In other cases it may result in situations such as hung juries or hung parliaments.

A split vote may arise from vote splitting, which occurs in an election when the existence of two or more similar candidates reduces the votes received by each of them, reducing the chances of any one of them winning against another, significantly different, candidate. In systems that require a winning candidate to receive a majority of votes, this may result in a runoff election.

<doc id="538389" wikidata="Q351635" url="?curid=538389" title="Stanislaus of Szczepanów">
<text>Stanislaus of Szczepanów (; 26 July 1030 – 11 April 1079) was a Polish Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Kraków and was martyred by the Polish King Bolesław II the Bold. He is the patron saint of Poland.

Stanislaus is venerated in the Catholic Church as Stanislaus the Martyr (as distinct from the 16th-century Jesuit, Stanislaus Kostka).

==Life==
According to hagiographic tradition, Stanislaus, or Stanisław in Polish, was born at Szczepanów, a village in Lesser Poland, the only son of the noble and pious Wielisław and Bogna. He was educated at a cathedral school in Gniezno (then the capital of Poland) and later, probably at Paris. On his return to Poland, Stanislaus was ordained a priest by Lambert II Suła, Bishop of Kraków. Following his ordination, he was given a canonry in Kraków and became known for his preaching. He was subsequently made pastor of Czembocz near Kraków, canon and preacher at the cathedral, and later, vicar-general.

After the bishop&#x27;s death (1072), Stanislaus was elected his successor but accepted the office only at the explicit command of Pope Alexander II. Stanislaus was one of the earliest native Polish bishops. He also became a ducal advisor and had some influence on Polish politics.

Stanislaus&#x27; major accomplishments included bringing papal legates to Poland, and reestablishment of a metropolitan see in Gniezno. The latter was a precondition for Duke Bolesław&#x27;s coronation as king, which took place in 1076. Stanislaus then encouraged King Bolesław to establish Benedictine monasteries to aid in the Christianization of Poland.

==Legend==

Stanislaus initial conflict with King Bolesław was over a land dispute. Stanislaus had purchased for the diocese a piece of land on the banks of the Vistula River near Lublin from a certain Peter (&quot;Piotr&quot;), but after Piotr&#x27;s death the land had been claimed by his family. The King ruled for the claimants, but according to legend, Stanislaus resurrected Piotr so that he could confirm that he had sold the land to the bishop.

According to Augustin Calmet, an 18th-century Bible scholar, Stanislaus asked the King for three days to produce his witness, Piotr. The King and the court were said to have laughed at the absurd request, but the King granted Stanislaus the three days. Stanislaus spent them in ceaseless prayer and, dressed in full bishop&#x27;s regalia, went with a procession to the cemetery where Piotr had been buried three years earlier. He had Piotr&#x27;s grave dug up until his remains were discovered. Then, before a multitude of witnesses, Stanislaus made Piotr rise, and Piotr did so.

Piotr was then dressed in a cloak and brought before King Bolesław to testify on Stanislaus&#x27; behalf. The dumbfounded court heard Piotr reprimand his three sons and testify that Stanislaus had indeed paid for the land. Unable to give any other verdict, the King dismissed the suit against the bishop. Stanislaus asked Piotr whether he would remain alive, but Piotr declined and so was laid to rest once more in his grave and was reburied.

==Chastisement of Bolesław ==
A more substantial conflict with King Bolesław arose after a prolonged war in Ruthenia, when weary warriors deserted and went home, alarmed at tidings that their overseers were taking over their estates and wives. According to Wincenty Kadłubek, the King punished the soldiers&#x27; faithless wives very cruelly and was criticized for it by Bishop Stanislaus. Jan Długosz, however, writes that the bishop had in fact criticized the King for his own sexual immorality. Gallus Anonymus, in his laconic account, only condemned both the &quot;traitor bishop&quot; and the violent king.

Whatever the actual cause of the conflict between them, the result was that the bishop excommunicated King Bolesław, which included forbidding the saying of the Divine Office by the canons of Kraków Cathedral in case Bolesław attended. The excommunication aided the King&#x27;s political opponents, and the King accused Bishop Stanislaus of treason and the royal court found him guilty.

==Martyrdom==

King Bolesław sent his men to execute Bishop Stanislaus but when they didn&#x27;t dare to touch the bishop, the King decided to kill the bishop himself. He is said to have slain Stanislaus while he was celebrating Mass in the Skałka outside the walls of Kraków. According to Paweł Jasienica: &quot;Polska Piastów&quot;, it was actually in the Wawel Castle. The guards then cut the bishop&#x27;s body into pieces and scattered them to be devoured by wild beasts. According to the legend, his members miraculously reintegrated while the pool was guarded by four eagles.

The exact date of Stanislaus&#x27;s death is uncertain. According to different sources, it was either 11 April or 8 May 1079.

The murder stirred outrage throughout the land and led to the dethronement of King Bolesław II the Generous, who had to seek refuge in Hungary and was succeeded by his brother, Władysław I Herman.

Whether Stanislaus should be regarded as a traitor or a hero remains one of the classic unresolved questions of Polish history. His story has a parallel in the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170 by henchmen of England&#x27;s King Henry II.

==Original sources==
There is little information about Stanislaus&#x27;s life. The only near-contemporary source was a chronicle of Gallus Anonymus, but the author evaded writing details about a conflict with the king. Later sources are the chronicles of Wincenty Kadłubek, and two hagiographies by Wincenty of Kielcza. All contain hagiographic matter.

==Veneration as a saint==
The cult of Saint Stanislaus the Martyr began immediately upon his death. In 1245 his relics were translated (&quot;i.e.&quot;, moved) to Kraków&#x27;s Wawel Cathedral. In the early 13th century, Bishop Iwo Odrowąż initiated preparations for Stanislaus&#x27; canonization and ordered Wincenty of Kielce to write the martyr&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot;. Stanislaus of Kraków was canonized by Pope Innocent IV at Assisi in 1253.

Pope Pius V did not include the saint&#x27;s feast day in the Tridentine calendar for use throughout the Roman Catholic Church. Subsequently, Pope Clement VIII inserted it, setting it for 7 May, but Kraków observes it on 8 May, a supposed date of the saint&#x27;s death, having done so since 8 May 1254, when it was attended by many Polish bishops and princes. In 1969, the Church moved the feast to 11 April, considered to be the date of his death in 1079.
As the first native Polish saint, Stanislaus is the patron of Poland and Kraków, and of some Polish dioceses. He shares the patronage of Poland with Saint Adalbert of Prague, Florian, and Our Lady the Queen of Poland.

Wawel Cathedral, which holds the saint&#x27;s relics, became a principal national shrine. Almost all of the Polish kings from Władysław I the Elbow-high were crowned while they knelt before his sarcophagus, which stands in the middle of the cathedral. In the 17th century, King Władysław IV Vasa commissioned an ornate silver coffin to hold the saint&#x27;s relics. It was destroyed by Swedish troops during the Deluge but was replaced with a new one c. 1670.

Saint Stanislaus&#x27; veneration has had great patriotic importance. In the period of Poland&#x27;s feudal fragmentation, it was believed that Poland would one day reintegrate as had the members of his body. Half a millennium after Poland had indeed reintegrated, while yet another dismemberment of the polity was underway in the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the framers of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would dedicate this progressive political document to Saint Stanislaus, whose feast day fell close to the date of the Constitution&#x27;s adoption.

Each year on the first Sunday after 8 May, a procession, led by the Bishop of Kraków, goes out from Wawel to the Church on the Rock. The procession, once a local event, was popularized in the 20th century by Polish Primate Stefan Wyszyński and Archbishop of Kraków, Karol Wojtyła. Wojtyla, as Pope John Paul II, called Saint Stanislaus the patron saint of moral order and wanted his first papal return to Poland to occur in April 1979 in observance of the 900th anniversary to the day of his martyrdom, but the Communist rulers of that time blocked this, causing the visit to be delayed until June of that year.

Roman Catholic churches belonging to Polish communities outside Poland are often dedicated to Saint Stanislaus.

In iconography, Saint Stanislaus is usually depicted as a bishop holding a sword, the instrument of his martyrdom, and sometimes with Piotr rising from the dead at his feet.
