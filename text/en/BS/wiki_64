<text>A royal commission is a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry into a defined issue in some monarchies. They have been held in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Malaysia, Mauritius and Saudi Arabia. In republics an equivalent entity may be termed a commission of inquiry. 

Such an inquiry has considerable powers, typically equivalent or greater than those of a judge but restricted to the terms of reference for which it was created. These powers may include subpoenaing witnesses, notably video evidences, taking evidence under oath and requesting documents.

The commission is created by the head of state (the sovereign, or their representative in the form of a governor-general or governor) on the advice of the government and formally appointed by letters patent. In practice—unlike lesser forms of inquiry—once a commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish.

Royal commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy. These can be matters such as government structure, the treatment of minorities, events of considerable public concern or economic questions. Many royal commissions last many years and, often, a different government is left to respond to the findings.

== Notable royal commissions ==
=== Australia ===

Royal commissions have been held in Australia at a federal level since 1902. Royal commissions appointed by the Governor-General operate under the Royal Commissions Act 1902 passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1902. A defunct alternative is known as a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry.

Royal commissions are the highest form of inquiry on matters of public importance. A royal commission is formally established by the Governor-General on behalf of the Crown and on the advice of government Ministers. The government decides the terms of reference, provides the funding and appoints the commissioners, who are selected on the basis of their independence and qualifications. They are never serving politicians.

Royal commissions are usually chaired by one or more notable figures. Because of their quasi-judicial powers the commissioners are often retired or serving judges. They usually involve research into an issue, consultations with experts both within and outside government and public consultations as well. The warrant may grant immense investigatory powers, including summoning witnesses under oath, offering of indemnities, seizing of documents and other evidence (sometimes including those normally protected, such as classified information), holding hearings &quot;in camera&quot; if necessary and—in a few cases—compelling all government officials to aid in the execution of the commission. The results of royal commissions are published in reports, often massive, of findings containing policy recommendations. 

Due to the verbose nature of the titles of these formal documents they are commonly known by the name of the commission&#x27;s chair. For example, the “Royal Commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer” is known as the Kennedy Royal Commission.

While these reports are often quite influential, with the government enacting some or all recommendations into law, the work of some commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government. In other cases, where the commissioner has departed from the Warranted terms, the commission has been dissolved by a superior court.

<text>A courier is a person or organization that delivers a message, package or letter from one place or person to another place or person. Typically, a courier provides their courier service on a commercial contract basis; however, some couriers are government or state agency employees (for example: a diplomatic courier).

==Duties and functions==
Couriers are distinguished from ordinary mail services by features such as speed, security, tracking, signature, specialization and individualization of express services, and swift delivery times, which are optional for most everyday mail services. As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is normally limited to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost.

Courier services operate on all scales, from within specific towns or cities, to regional, national and global services. Large courier companies include DHL, PathaoDTDC, FedEx, EMS International, TNT, UPS, India Post, J&amp;T Express and Aramex. These offer services worldwide, typically via a hub and spoke model.

Couriers services utilizing courier software provide electronic proof of delivery and electronic tracking details.

==Before the industrial era==

In ancient history, messages were hand-delivered using a variety of methods, including runners, homing pigeons and riders on horseback. Before the introduction of mechanized courier services, foot messengers physically ran miles to their destinations. Xenophon attributed the first use of couriers to the Persian prince Cyrus the Younger.

Famously, the Ancient Greek courier Pheidippides is said to have run 26 miles from Marathon to Athens to bring the news of the Greek victory over the Persians in 490 BCE. The long-distance race known as a marathon is named for this run.

=== Hezekiah ===
Judah&#x27;s king, Hezekiah, dates between 200 and 400 BCE, where several couriers brought letters throughout the land of Judah and Israel (cf. 2 Chron 30 ESV).

=== Hemerodromi and Anabasii ===
&quot;Hemerodromoi&quot; (day-runners), &quot;Hemeroscopoi&quot; (day-watchers) and &quot;Dromokerykes&quot; (runner heralds) were specialized couriers in ancient Greece renowned for their exceptional endurance. These trained runners were employed to carry important news, often conveying information about significant events across the Greek world. They also performed a form of surveillance. In times of danger, they were often stationed on elevated positions such as hills to observe important events or military movements.
Starting at the time of Augustus, the ancient Greeks and Romans made use of a class of horse and chariot-mounted couriers called &quot;anabasii&quot; to quickly bring messages and commands from long distances. The word &quot;anabasii&quot; comes from the Greek (&quot;anábasis&quot;, &quot;ascent, mounting&quot;). 

In Roman Britain, Rufinus made use of anabasii, as documented in Saint Jerome&#x27;s memoirs (&quot;adv. Ruffinum&quot;, l. 3. c. 1.): &quot;Idcircone Cereales et Anabasii tui per diversas provincias cucurrerunt, ut laudes meas legerent?&quot; (&quot;Is it on that account that your Cereales and Anabasii circulated through many provinces, so that they might read my praises?&quot;)

=== Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages, royal courts maintained their own messengers who were paid little more than common labourers.

==Types==
In cities, there are often bicycle couriers or motorcycle couriers but for consignments requiring delivery over greater distance networks, this may often include trucks, railroads and aircraft.

Many companies which operate under a just-in-time or &quot;JIT&quot; inventory method often use on-board couriers (OBCs). On-board couriers are individuals who can travel at a moment&#x27;s notice anywhere in the world, usually via commercial airlines. While this type of service is the second costliest—general aviation charters are far more expensive—companies analyze the cost of service to engage an on-board courier versus the &quot;cost&quot; the company will realize should the product not arrive by a specified time (an assembly line stopping, untimely court filing, lost sales from product or components missing a delivery deadline, loss of life from a delayed organ transplant).

==By country==
=== Australia ===
The courier business in Australia is a very competitive industry and is mainly concentrated in the high population areas in and around the capital cities. With such a vast mass of land to cover the courier companies tend to transport either by air or by the main transport routes and national highways. The only large company that provides a country-wide service is Australia Post.Australian Post operates quite differently to government departments, as it is government-owned enterprise focused on service delivery in a competitive market. It operates in a fully competitive market against other delivery services such as &quot;Fastway, UPS, and Transdirect&quot;.

=== China ===
International courier services in China include TNT, EMS International, DHL, FedEx and UPS. These companies provide nominal worldwide service for both inbound and outbound shipments, connecting China to countries such as the US, Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Of the international courier services, the Dutch company TNT is considered to have the most capable local fluency and efficacy for third- and fourth- tiered cities. EMS International is a unit of China Post, and as such is not available for shipments originating outside China.

Domestic courier services include SF Express, STO Express (申通), ZTO Express (中通), YTO Express (圆通), E-EMS (E邮宝), Cainiao Express (菜鸟) and many other operators of sometimes microscopic scales. E-EMS, is the special product of a co-operative arrangement between China Post and Alipay, which is the online payment unit of Alibaba Group. It is only available for the delivery of online purchases made using Alipay.

Within the Municipality of Beijing, TongCheng KuaiDi (同城快递), also a unit of China Post, provides intra-city service using cargo bicycles.

=== India ===
International courier services in India include DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart Express,Spicexpress and Logistics Pvt Ltd, Ekart, DTDC, VRL Courier Services, Delhivery, TNT, Amazon.com, OCS and Gati Ltd. Apart from these, several local couriers also operate across India. Almost all of these couriers can be tracked online. India Post, an undertaking by the Indian government, is the largest courier service with around 155 thousand branches (comprising 139 thousand (90%) in rural areas and 16 thousand (10%) in urban areas). All couriers use the PIN code or postal index number introduced by India Post to locate delivery address. Additionally, the contact number of the recipient and sender are voluntarily added on the courier for ease of locating the address.

=== Bangladesh ===
The history of courier services in Bangladesh dates back to the late 1970s when private companies started offering delivery and parcel services. These companies played a crucial role in facilitating the movement of documents and goods within the country. Over the years, the courier industry in Bangladesh has grown significantly, adapting to changes in technology and expanding its services to include international shipments. Today, various local and international courier companies operate in Bangladesh, contributing to the country&#x27;s logistics and trade networks.

Couriers that operate across Bangladesh include\ Pathao Courier, RedX,eCourier, Sonar Courier. Almost all of these couriers can be tracked online. Also international courier services in Bangladesh include DHL, FedEx, United Express, Royale International Bangladesh, DSL Worldwide Courier Service, Aramex, Pos Laju, J&amp;T Express, and Amazon.com.

=== Malaysia ===
International courier services in Malaysia include DHL, FedEx, Pgeon, Skynet Express, ABX Express, GDex, Pos Laju, J&amp;T Express, and Amazon.com. Apart from these, several local couriers also operate across Malaysia. Almost all of these couriers can be tracked online.

=== Ireland ===
The main courier services available in Ireland as alternatives to the national An Post system are Parcel Direct Ireland, DHL, UPS, TNT, DPD and FedEx.

===Singapore===
There are several international courier companies in Singapore including TNT, DHL and FedEx. Despite being a small country, the demand for courier services is high. Many local courier companies have sprung up to meet this demand. Most courier companies in Singapore focus on local deliveries instead of international freight.

=== United Kingdom ===
The genus of the UK same-day courier market stems from the London Taxi companies but soon expanded into dedicated motorcycle despatch riders with the taxi companies setting up separate arms to their companies to cover the courier work. During the late 1970s small provincial and regional companies were popping up throughout the country. Today, there are many large companies offering next-day courier services.

There are many &#x27;specialist&#x27; couriers usually for the transportation of items such as freight/pallets, sensitive documents and liquids.

The &#x27;Man &amp; Van&#x27;/Freelance courier business model, is highly popular in the United Kingdom, with thousands upon thousands of independent couriers and localised companies, offering next-day and same day services. This is likely to be so popular because of the low business requirements (a vehicle) and the lucrative number of items sent within the UK every day. In fact, from 1988 to 2016, UK couriers were considered universally self employed, though the number of salaried couriers employed by firms has grown substantially since then. However, since the dawn of the electronic age the way in which businesses use couriers has changed dramatically. Prior to email and the ability to create PDFs, documents represented a significant proportion of the business. However, over the past five years, documentation revenues have decreased by 50 percent. Customers are also demanding more from their courier partners. Therefore, more organisations prefer to use the services of larger organisations who are able to provide more flexibility and levels of service, which has led to another level of courier company, regional couriers. This is usually a local company which has expanded to more than one office to cover an area.

Some UK couriers offer next-day services to other European countries. FedEx offers next-day air delivery to many EU countries. Cheaper &#x27;by-road&#x27; options are also available, varying from two days&#x27; delivery time (such as France), to up to a week (former USSR countries).

Large couriers often require an account to be held (and this can include daily scheduled collections). Senders are therefore primarily in the commercial/industrial sector (and not the general public); some couriers such as DHL do however allow public sending (at higher cost than regular senders).

In recent years, the increased popularity of Black Friday in the UK has placed some firms under operational stress.

The process of booking a courier has changed; it is no longer a lengthy task of making numerous calls to different courier companies to request a quote. Booking a courier is predominantly carried out online. The courier industry has been quick to adapt to an ever-changing digital landscape, meeting the needs of mobile and desktop consumers as well as e-commerce and online retailers, offering end users access to instant online payments, parcel tracking, delivery notifications, and the convenience of door to door collection and delivery to almost any destination in the world.

===United States===

The courier industry has long held an important place in United States commerce and has been involved in pivotal moments in the nation&#x27;s history such as westward migration and the gold rush. Wells Fargo was founded in 1852 and rapidly became the preeminent package delivery company. The company specialised in shipping gold, packages and newspapers throughout the West, making a Wells Fargo office in every camp and settlement a necessity for commerce and connections to home. Shortly afterward, the Pony Express was established to move packages more quickly than the traditional stagecoach. It illustrated the demand for timely deliveries across the nation, a concept that continued to evolve with the railroads, automobiles and interstate highways and which has emerged into today&#x27;s courier industry.

The courier industry in United States is a $59 billion industry, with 90% of the business shared by DHL, FedEx, UPS and USA Couriers. On the other hand, regional and/or local courier and delivery services were highly diversified and tended to be smaller operations; the top 50 firms accounted for just a third of the sector&#x27;s revenues. USPS is mail or packages delivered by the government and are the only ones who can legally ship to mailboxes.

In a 2019 quarterly earnings call, the CEO of FedEx named Amazon as a direct competitor, cementing the e-commerce company&#x27;s growth into the field of logistics.

<text>Steven Levy (born 1951) is an American journalist and editor at large for &quot;Wired&quot; who has written extensively for publications on computers, technology, cryptography, the internet, cybersecurity, and privacy. He is the author of the 1984 book &quot;&quot;, which chronicles the early days of the computer underground. Levy published eight books covering computer hacker culture, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and multi-year exposés of Apple, Google, and Facebook. His most recent book, &quot;Facebook: The Inside Story&quot;, recounts the history and rise of Facebook from three years of interviews with employees, including Chamath Palihapitiya, Sheryl Sandberg, and Mark Zuckerberg.

== Early life and education ==
Levy was born in Philadelphia in 1951. He graduated from Central High School and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Temple University. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in literature from Pennsylvania State University. 

== Career ==
In the mid-1970s, Levy worked as a freelance journalist and frequently contributed to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; magazine. In 1976, he was a founding co-editor of the &quot;Free Times&quot;, a weekly guide to happenings in Philadelphia. He became as senior editor of &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot;, and rediscovered Albert Einstein&#x27;s brain floating in a mason jar in the Wichita office of pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey while reporting a story in 1978.

In the 1980s, Levy&#x27;s work became more focused on technology. In 1981, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; assigned him an article on computer hackers, which he expanded into a book &quot;,&quot; published in 1984. He described the &quot;hacker ethic&quot;, the belief that all information should be free and that it ought to change life for the better. Levy was a contributor to Stewart Brand&#x27;s &quot;Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot;, first published in 1984. He was a contributing editor to &quot;Popular Computing&quot; and wrote a monthly column in the magazine, initially called &quot;Telecomputing&quot; and later named &quot;Micro Journal&quot; and &quot;Computer Journal&quot;, from April 1983 to the magazine&#x27;s closure in December 1985. In December 1986, Levy founded the &quot;Macworld&quot; Game Hall of Fame, which &quot;Macworld&quot; published annually until 2009. Levy stepped away from the technology beat in his second book, on the murderous past of hippie and Earth Day co-founder Ira Einhorn, published in 1988 and adapted into an NBC TV miniseries with Naomi Watts in 1999. Levy&#x27;s 1992 book about AI called &quot;Artificial Life&quot; was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science and Technology. In 1994, he published the book &quot;Insanely Great&quot; about the Mac computer. 

Levy joined &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1995 as a technology writer and senior editor. In July 2004, Levy published a cover story for &quot;Newsweek&quot; (which also featured an interview with Apple CEO Steve Jobs) which unveiled the 4th generation of the iPod to the world before Apple had officially done so. He continued his coverage of the iPod into a book called &quot;The Perfect Thing&quot; published in 2006.

In 2014, he co-created the tech blog Backchannel, which was integrated into Wired in 2017. Since 2008, Levy has worked as a writer and editor at large for &quot;Wired&quot;. At various points throughout his career, Levy has written freelance pieces for publications including &quot;Harper&#x27;s,&quot; &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;Premiere.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He lives in New York City with his wife Teresa Carpenter, a Pulitzer Prize-winning true crime and history writer. They have a son.

<doc id="551842" wikidata="Q1710591" url="?curid=551842" title="Juan Moreira">
<text>Juan Moreira (1819 - April 1874) is a well-known figure in the history of Argentina. An outlaw, gaucho and folk-hero, he is considered one of the most renowned Argentinian rural bandits.

==Early life==
Moreira was born in the administrative area of La Matanza, in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first thirty years of his life were relatively uneventful, working in rural areas until he could buy his own ranch, some cattle, and land for farming. One characteristic that set him apart from others was that he rarely drank. Moreira devoted his free time to perfecting his skill on the guitar, which attracted the attention of Vicenta, the daughter of a local rancher. She fell in love with Moreira and eventually married him, with the full consent of her father.

Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his troubles began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also fallen in love with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he could think of, real or imaginary. The first thing he did was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization.

About that time, Moreira had lent Mr. Sardetti, a grocery-store owner, the sum of 10,000 pesos to buy merchandise. Fed up with asking for his money back, Moreira went to the Deputy Mayor, without any documentation, as was the custom at that time between men of their word, and reported what had happened in hopes that the Deputy Mayor would insist that Sardetti pay him back. It is unclear if Sardetti and Don Francisco were conspiring against Moreira, but Sardetti denied the story, and Moreira was thrown in jail for 48 hours for a form of attempted robbery.

==Point of no return==
This situation made Moreira so angry that he swore that he would stab Sardetti for every single peso he had lost. Moreira fulfilled his oath when he killed Mr. Sardetti in a facon duel at Sardetti&#x27;s grocery store. Returning home after a night of wandering, he found Don Francisco and four other soldiers waiting to arrest him. He resisted, and during the fight, Don Francisco and two soldiers were killed.

Extremely able in knifefights, Moreira won them all, even against more than one person. He gained such fame for this that men looked for him and picked fights with him to gain the glory of defeating him, but he never lost. He avoided fights whenever he could, and only killed after repeated provocation and in self-defense. Eventually, he served as a bodyguard for powerful politicians who promised to clean Moreira&#x27;s reputation, but they never did so.

It is said that Moreira never took the saddle off his horse, just in case he had to make a quick escape. He spent much of this part of his life wandering through different towns and cities of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, including Navarro, Las Heras, Lobos, Veinticinco de Mayo and the lands of the Indian Cacique Coliqueo.

==Death==
In April, 1874, Casimiro Villamayor, the justice of the peace in Lobos, was ordered by Mariano Acosta, governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, to send a posse led by Commander Bosch from the police department in Buenos Aires to arrest Moreira. They surrounded the grocery and saloon (&quot;pulpería&quot;) named &quot;La Estrella,&quot; where Moreira was holed up. Moreira fought like a wild animal against the police, and he was at the point of leaping over the wall which separated him from his horse when he was bayoneted in the left lung by one of the officers, Sergeant Chirino. Moreira managed to shoot at Chirino, who lost an eye, as well as to injure one other officer before he died. He was survived by his wife and a child, also named Juan. He was buried at the Lobos cemetery.

==Legacy==
Juan Moreira is one of the most important figures in the popular history of Argentina. His life was laden with the violence and injustice which typified the unfair treatment received by the gauchos, treatment which led to his death. His skull and some personal belongings can be seen at Juan Domingo Perón Museum. His life inspired a very popular novel by romantic author Eduardo Gutiérrez, which in turn inspired at least four biographical films entitled &quot;Juan Moreira&quot;. The most important of these films, &quot;Juan Moreira&quot; was directed by Leonardo Favio in 1973, starring Rodolfo Bebán as the title character. The night of his death was fictionalized by Jorge Luis Borges in a short story, &quot;La noche de los dones&quot;.

<text>Goraždevac (, ) is a village near the city of Peja in Kosovo. It has been inhabited since at least the thirteenth century, when it was mentioned in the chrysobull of Stefan Nemanja (or his son, Stefan the First-Crowned).

==History==
During World War II, 47 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed in the village in 1941 by Albanian paramilitaries. As a Serb-inhabited enclave in a heavily Albanian-inhabited region of western Kosovo, Goraždevac has been the scene of ethnic tensions between the two communities. It was the scene of attacks by the guerilla group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, in the late 1990s as they fought the Serb military forces, accused of committing atrocities against the Albanian population. After the end of the Kosovo War in June 1999, many of its population of around 2,000 Serbs fled attacks by Albanian militants, though some later returned. The population today is said to be around 850 people.

In June 2003, Veselin Besović from Goraždevac was sentenced by an international court in Peja to serve seven years in prison for crimes allegedly committed in the villages of Čuska and Zahać. He has appealed.

According to the 2011 census in Kosovo, the village had 570 people, of whom 255 were Serbs (44.7%), 148 were Albanians (25.9%), 139 Roma and Egyptians (24.4%), 26 Bosniaks (4.6%) and 2 others. The census was partially boycotted by the Serb population.

===2003 Goraždevac murders===

Goraždevac, a village in Kosovo, has faced repeated attacks from unidentified Albanian assailants since the Kosovo War ended. The village is one of several Kosovo Serb enclaves that receive continuous protection from KFOR troops. In August 2003, a 19-year-old Serbian teenager and a 12-year-old boy were killed, with four more children wounded, with fire from automatic rifles, while swimming in the Bistrica near Goraždevac. This attack occurred shortly before 200 Kosovo Serb refugees were set to return to their homes. However, the return plans were abruptly halted due to the incident. The culprits remain unidentified.

Cheadle went on to attend the California Institute of the Arts, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in theater in 1986.

==Career==
=== 1984–1992: Early roles and theatre work ===

During his time at CalArts, Cheadle along with his friends acted in numerous plays such as Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the Boys&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot;; and &quot;My Name Could Be Anne&quot; in the black box theater. Cheadle became eligible for his Screen Actors Guild card when he appeared as a burger joint employee in the 1985 comedy &quot;Moving Violations&quot;. In 1987, he received a small role in the 7th season of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, where he played a teenager with learning difficulties. This was followed by an appearance in &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; the same year. Cheadle secured the role of Jack in the April 1, 1988, &quot;Jung and the Restless&quot; episode of &quot;Night Court&quot;; although his character was 16 years old, Cheadle was 23 at the time.

Cheadle then played the role of Rocket in the 1988 movie &quot;Colors&quot;. In 1989, he appeared in a music video for Angela Winbush&#x27;s number-two hit single &quot;It&#x27;s the Real Thing&quot; as a car wash employee performing dance moves. In 1990, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; titled &quot;Homeboy, Sweet Homeboy&quot;, playing Will Smith&#x27;s friend and Hilary&#x27;s first love interest, Ice Tray. In 1992, he had a starring role in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; spin-off &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; as Roland Wilson, a young serious hotel manager that Blanche, Rose, and Sophia had retained from the previous owners. He subsequently played district attorney John Littleton on three seasons of &quot;Picket Fences&quot;.

===1993–2001: Rise to prominence ===
Cheadle first received widespread notice for his portrayal of Mouse Alexander in the 1995 film &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, for which he won Best Supporting Actor awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics and earned nominations for similar awards from the Screen Actors Guild and the NAACP Image Awards. Following soon thereafter was his performance in the title role of the 1996 HBO TV movie &quot;&quot;. In 1997, he starred in John Singleton&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Rosewood&quot; and in the disaster film &quot;Volcano&quot;. In the same year, he appeared in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s period drama &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. The following year, he appeared in &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. The film was an adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s 1996 novel of the same name and the first of Cheadle&#x27;s many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.

Cheadle&#x27;s portrayal of Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1998 TV movie &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; won him a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. A year later he starred as Grant Wiggins, a school teacher in the film &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot;, which won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. It was based on the novel of the same name by Ernest J. Gaines. He had two major film roles in 2000, starring as Montel Gordon, a DEA agent in &quot;Traffic&quot; and as Luke Graham in the sci-fi film &quot;Mission to Mars&quot;. The following year, he played Basher Tarr in the heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts, and reprised his role for the sequels &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; in 2007.

=== 2002–2009: Established actor ===
Cheadle appeared in NFL commercials promoting the Super Bowl from 2002 to 2005. He so regularly appeared for the NFL in its Super Bowl advertising that in 2006, in a drive to get fans to submit their own advertising ideas, the NFL sought his permission to reference his previous commercials to portray themselves as having no new ideas: &quot;he quickly signed off on the idea and found it funny.&quot; Abe Sutton (along with Etan Bednarsh), one of the finalists in this NFL contest, played on this commercial by proposing an ad in which every player on a football team is Don Cheadle.

In 2005, Cheadle was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina in the film &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;. He also starred in and co-produced &quot;Crash&quot;, which won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Picture.

In March 2007, Cheadle starred with comedian Adam Sandler in Mike Binder&#x27;s &quot;Reign Over Me&quot;, a comedy-drama about a man who has slipped away from reality after the death of his wife and three daughters on 9/11. The film was a box office flop, earning a domestic gross of $22.2 million. Cheadle later starred in the 2009 DreamWorks Pictures film &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot;. Cheadle was to make his directorial debut with the adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot;, but in July 2007, he stated, Tishomingo&#x27; is dead...&quot;

In 2009, Cheadle and &quot;Boondocks&quot; creator Aaron McGruder worked on a potential comedy show on NBC. The &quot;project revolve[d] around mismatched brothers who reunite to open a private security company.&quot; Cheadle and McGruder were slated to serve as executive producers, while McGruder was expected to write the script.

Also in 2009, Cheadle performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; and its companion volume &quot;Voices of a People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;.

From 2012 to 2016, Cheadle starred in the Showtime TV series &quot;House of Lies&quot;. In 2013, he won the Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Comedy Series for his role on the show. He was in the show for five seasons until it ended in 2016.

Cheadle spent 10 years writing and producing the film &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; (2016) based on the life of jazz musician Miles Davis. Cheadle also directed and starred in the film. Locations for the movie were found in Cincinnati.

In 2018, Cheadle guest-starred in the first-season finale of &quot;DuckTales&quot;, providing Donald Duck&#x27;s new voice box. He later guest-starred again in 2020 during season three after a wish Donald made to Gene the Genie had altered reality.

=== 2021–present ===
In 2021, Cheadle starred in the period crime thriller &quot;No Sudden Move&quot;, in which he played Curt Goynes, a gangster in 1950s Detroit. Around that same year, Cheadle played a villain role in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, portraying the role of the main antagonist Al-G Rhythm.

The feature premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, followed by a limited theatrical release in December 2024.

Cheadle is set to lead the Marvel film &quot;Armor Wars&quot;.

==Activism==
Cheadle has campaigned to end the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Cheadle and John Prendergast co-authored a book about this issue entitled &quot;Not on Our Watch: The Mission to End Genocide in Darfur and Beyond&quot;. With George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, Cheadle co-founded the Not on Our Watch Project, an organization focusing global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities. Cheadle was awarded the BET Humanitarian award of the year in 2007 for his humanitarian work for the people of Darfur and Rwanda.

At the 2007 World Series of Poker, Cheadle and poker player Annie Duke organized an annual charity poker tournament, Ante Up for Africa.

On December 13, 2007, Cheadle and fellow actor George Clooney were presented with the Summit Peace Award by the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome for their work to stop the genocide and relieve the suffering of the people of Darfur.

Cheadle has worked with the United Nations on climate change concerns. He and Harrison Ford created a documentary event series entitled &quot;Years of Living Dangerously&quot; that provided first-hand reports on those affected by, and seeking solutions to climate change. He is also on the advisory board of Citizens&#x27; Climate Lobby.

In 2010, Cheadle was named U.N. Environment Program Goodwill Ambassador. Also in 2010, he and Prendergast published their second book: &quot;The Enough Moment: Fighting to End Africa&#x27;s Worst Human Rights Crimes&quot;.

On his 2019 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance, he wore a T-shirt saying &quot;protect trans kids&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Cheadle&#x27;s family history was profiled on the PBS series &quot;African American Lives 2&quot;. The family history revealed that Cheadle&#x27;s ancestors had been owned by the Chickasaw Nation, who had refused to free their slaves until 1866. Cheadle&#x27;s ancestors did not hold U.S. nor Chickasaw citizenship until the 1890s, due to the Dawes Commission. A DNA test taken by the show revealed that Cheadle is of Cameroonian descent. Another DNA test revealed that among his African ancestry, one-third comes from the region from Senegal to Liberia, just over one-quarter comes from the Congo-Angola region, and the rest comes from western Nigeria and Benin.

Cheadle married his long-time partner, actress and &quot;Rosewood&quot; co-star Bridgid Coulter, in early 2020. The couple has been together for more than 28 years and have two children.

<text>Timo Aulis Rautiainen (born 25 January 1963, in Sulkava, Finland) is a Finnish heavy metal singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is best known as the singer and songwriter of Timo Rautiainen &amp; Trio Niskalaukaus. He has also sung and played guitar in the bands Lyijykomppania and Aku Ankkuli.

==Career==
Rautiainen graduated from the University of Jyväskylä as a teacher of special education. In the early stages of Trio Niskalaukaus, Rautiainen was commonly represented in the main media as &quot;The Grim Teacher&quot;, because of his strong and rather gloomy lyrics and his occupation. However, in later years he concentrated solely on his musical career, resigning from his educational activities. Despite his earlier and solemn representation in Finnish media, he is actually a man with a good sense of humour, and he is characterized by his laid back nature on stage.

In December 2004, Timo Rautiainen &amp; Trio Niskalaukaus announced that they would be going on break for an indefinite period. While the band was on hiatus, Rautiainen starred on the Finnish talk-show &quot;K-Rappu&quot;, which concentrated on culture. On 1 November 2006, Trio Niskalaukaus announced that they would be breaking up.

After the breakup, Rautiainen published his first solo album titled &quot;Sarvivuori&quot; in 2006 with a crew gathered from different bands. The album featured the talents of Nightwish founder Tuomas Holopainen (who also wrote one song) and former Children of Bodom guitarist, Alexander Kuoppala. On drums debuted renowned Finnish actor Jussi Lampi.

Initially Rautiainen was supposed to do only one solo album, but after the album&#x27;s good reception and the band&#x27;s highly successful summer tour he changed his mind. In 2007 his second solo album, &quot;Loppuun ajettu&quot;, was released. The line-up changed a bit, and Jarkko Petosalmi, former Trio Niskalaukaus guitarist, joined Rautiainen&#x27;s solo band. The album entered the Finnish charts at #5 in its first week.

<text>Spider monkeys are New World monkeys belonging to the genus Ateles, part of the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus consists of seven species, all of which are under threat; the brown spider monkey is critically endangered. They are also notable for their ability to be easily bred in captivity.

Disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of the largest New World monkeys and give rise to their common name. Spider monkeys live in the upper layers of the rainforest and forage in the high canopy, from . They primarily eat fruits, but will also occasionally consume leaves, flowers, and insects. Due to their large size, spider monkeys require large tracts of moist evergreen forests, and prefer undisturbed primary rainforest. They are social animals and live in bands of up to 35 individuals, but will split up to forage during the day.

Recent meta-analyses on primate cognition studies indicated spider monkeys are the most intelligent New World monkeys. They can produce a wide range of sounds and will &quot;bark&quot; when threatened; other vocalisations include a whinny similar to a horse and prolonged screams.

They are an important food source due to their large size, so are widely hunted by local human populations; they are also threatened by habitat destruction due to logging and land clearing. Spider monkeys are susceptible to malaria and are used in laboratory studies of the disease. The population trend for spider monkeys is decreasing; the IUCN Red List lists one species as vulnerable, five species as endangered and one species as critically endangered.

==Evolutionary history==
Theories abound about the evolution of the atelines; one theory is they are most closely related to the woolly spider monkeys (&quot;Brachyteles&quot;), and most likely split from woolly monkeys (&quot;Lagothrix&quot;) in the South American lowland forest, to evolve their unique locomotory system. This theory is not supported by fossil evidence. Other theories include &quot;Brachyteles&quot;, &quot;Lagothrix&quot; and &quot;Ateles&quot; in an unresolved trichotomy, and two clades, one composed of &quot;Ateles&quot; and &quot;Lagothrix&quot; and the other of &quot;Alouatta&quot; and &quot;Brachyteles&quot;. More recent molecular evidence suggests the Atelinae split in the middle to late Miocene (13 Ma), separating spider monkeys from the woolly spider monkeys and the woolly monkeys.

== Taxonomic classification == 
The genus name &quot;Ateles&quot; derives from the ancient greek word (), meaning &quot;incomplete, imperfect&quot;, in reference to the reduced or non-existent thumbs of spider monkeys.

The genus contains seven species, and seven subspecies.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Spider monkeys are among the largest New World monkeys; black-headed spider monkeys, the largest spider monkey, have an average weight of for males and for females. Disproportionately long, spindly limbs inspired the spider monkey&#x27;s common name. Their deftly prehensile tails, which may be up to long, have very flexible, hairless tips and skin grooves similar to fingerprints. This adaptation to their strictly arboreal lifestyle serves as a fifth hand. When the monkey walks, its arms practically drag on the ground. Unlike many monkeys, they do not use their arms for balance when walking, instead relying on their tails. The hands are long, narrow, and hook-like and have reduced or nonexistent thumbs. The fingers are elongated and recurved.

Their hair is coarse, ranging in color from ruddy gold to brown and black, or white in a rare number of specimens. The hands and feet are usually black. Heads are small with hairless faces. The nostrils are very far apart, which is a distinguishing feature of spider monkeys.

Spider monkeys are highly agile, and they are said to be second only to the gibbons in this respect. They have been seen in the wild jumping from tree to tree.
Female spider monkeys have a clitoris that is especially developed; it may be referred to as a pseudo-penis because it has an interior passage, or urethra, that makes it almost identical to the penis, and retains and distributes urine droplets as the female moves around. This urine is emptied at the bases of the clitoris, and collects in skin folds on either side of a groove on the perineal. Researchers and observers of spider monkeys of South America look for a scrotum to determine the animal sex because these female spider monkeys have pendulous and erectile clitorises long enough to be mistaken for a penis; researchers may also determine the animal&#x27;s sex by identifying scent-marking glands that may be present on the clitoris.

==Behavior==
Spider monkeys form loose groups, typically with 15 to 25 individuals, but sometimes up to 30 or 40. During the day, groups break up into subgroups. The size of subgroups and the degree to which they avoid each other during the day depends on food competition and the risk of predation. The average subgroup size is between 2 and 8 but can sometimes be up to 17 animals. Also less common in primates, females rather than males disperse at puberty to join new groups. Males tend to stick together for their whole lives. Hence, males in a group are more likely to be related and have closer bonds than females. Males also cement bonds through &quot;grappling&quot;: prolonged hugging, face greeting, tail intertwining, and genital manipulation. However, the strongest social bonds are between females and their young offspring.

Spider monkeys communicate their intentions and observations using postures and stances, such as postures of sexual receptivity and of attack. When a spider monkey sees a human approaching, it barks loudly similar to a dog. When a monkey is approached, it climbs to the end of the branch it is on and shakes it vigorously to scare away the possible threat. It shakes the branches with its feet, hands, or a combination while hanging from its tail. It may also scratch its limbs or body with various parts of its hands and feet. Seated monkeys may sway and make noise. Males and occasionally adult females growl menacingly at the approach of a human. If the pursuer continues to advance, the monkeys may break off live or dead tree limbs weighing up to and drop them towards the intruder. The monkeys also defecate and urinate toward the intruder.

Spider monkeys are diurnal and spend the night sleeping in carefully selected trees. Groups are thought to be directed by a lead female, which is responsible for planning an efficient feeding route each day. Grooming is not as important to social interaction, owing perhaps to a lack of thumbs.

Spider monkeys have been observed avoiding the upper canopy of the trees for locomotion. One researcher speculated this was because the thin branches at the tops of trees do not support the monkeys as well.

At , the spider monkey brain is twice the size of the brain of a howler monkey of equivalent body size; this is thought to be a result of the spider monkeys&#x27; complex social system and their frugivorous diets, which consist primarily of ripe fruit from a wide variety (over 150 species) of plants. This requires the monkeys to remember when and where fruit can be found. The slow development may also play a role: the monkeys may live from 20 to 27 years or more, and females give birth once every 17 to 45 months. Gummy, presumably the oldest spider monkey in captivity, is presumed to have been born wild in 1962, resided at Fort Rickey Children&#x27;s Discovery Zoo located in Rome, New York, and died at the age of 61, after living about twice as long as the average spider monkey.

==Diet==

Spider monkeys eat fleshy fruits 71 to 83 percent of the time. They can live for long periods on only one or two kinds of fruits and nuts. They eat the fruits of many big forest trees, and because they swallow fruits whole, the seeds are eventually excreted and fertilized by the feces. Studies show the diet of spider monkeys changes their reproductive, social, and physical behavioral patterns. Most feeding happens from dawn to 10 am. Afterward, the adults rest while the young play. Through the rest of the day, they may feed infrequently until around 10 pm. If food is scarce, they may eat insects, leaves, bird eggs, bark and honey.

Spider monkeys have a unique way of getting food: a lead female is generally responsible for finding food sources. If she cannot find enough food for the group, it splits into smaller groups that forage separately. The traveling groups have four to nine animals. Each group is closely associated with its territory. If the group is big, it spreads out.

==Reproduction==
The female chooses a male from her group for mating. Both males and females use &quot;anogenital sniffing&quot; to check their mates for readiness for copulation. The gestation period ranges from 226 to 232 days. Each female bears only one offspring on average, every three to four years.

Until six to ten months of age, infants rely completely on their mothers. Males are not involved in raising the offspring.

A mother carries her infant around her belly for the first month after birth. After this, she carries it on her lower back. The infant wraps its tail around its mother&#x27;s and tightly grabs her midsection. Mothers are very protective of their young and are generally attentive mothers. They have been seen grabbing their young and putting them on their backs for protection and to help them navigate from tree to tree. They help the more independent young to cross by pulling branches closer together. Mothers also groom their young.

Male spider monkeys are one of the few primates that do not have a penis bone (baculum).

==Cultural depictions==
Spider monkeys are found in many aspects of the Mesoamerican cultures. In the Aztec 260-day calendar, Spider Monkey (Nahua &quot;Ozomatli&quot;) serves as the name for the 11th day. In the corresponding Maya calendar, Howler Monkey (Batz) is substituted for Spider Monkey. In present-day Maya religious feasts, spider monkey impersonators serve as a kind of demonic clowns. In Classical Maya art, they are ubiquitous, often shown carrying cacao pods.

&quot;Captain Simian &amp; the Space Monkeys&quot; features a spider monkey named Spydor who is the smallest of the crew.

<text>Penguin Books Limited is a German-owned English publishing house. It was co-founded in 1935 by Allen Lane with his brothers Richard and John, as a line of the publishers the Bodley Head, only becoming a separate company the following year. Penguin revolutionised publishing in the 1930s through its inexpensive paperbacks, sold through Woolworths and other stores for sixpence, bringing high-quality fiction and non-fiction to the mass market. Its success showed that large audiences existed for several books. It also affected modern British popular culture significantly through its books concerning politics, the arts, and science.

Penguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House, a conglomerate formed in 2013 by its merger with American publisher Random House, a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. Formerly, Penguin Group was wholly owned by British Pearson plc, the global media company which also owned the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. When Penguin Random House was formed, Pearson had a 47% stake in the new company, which was reduced to 25% in July 2017. Since April 2020, Penguin Random House has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann. It is one of the largest English-language publishers known as the Big Five, along with Holtzbrinck/Macmillan, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster.

Penguin Books has its registered office in the City of Westminster, London, England.

==Origins==

The first Penguin paperbacks were published in 1935, but at first only as an imprint of The Bodley Head (of Vigo Street, London) with the books originally distributed from the crypt of Holy Trinity Church Marylebone.

Anecdotally, Lane recounted how it was his experience with the poor quality of reading material on offer at Exeter St Davids station that inspired him to create cheap, well designed quality books for the mass market. The question of how publishers could reach a larger public had been the subject of a conference at Rippon Hall, Oxford, in 1934 which Lane had attended. Though the publication of literature in paperback was then associated mainly with poor quality lurid fiction, the Penguin brand owed something to the short-lived Albatross imprint of British and American reprints that briefly traded in 1932.

Inexpensive paperbacks did not initially appear viable to Bodley Head, since the deliberately low price of 6d. made profitability seem unlikely. This helped Lane purchase publication rights for some works more cheaply than he otherwise might have, since publishers were convinced of the business&#x27;s short-term prospects. In the face of resistance from the traditional book trade, it was the purchase of 63,000 books by Woolworths Group that paid for the project outright, confirmed its worth, and allowed Lane to establish Penguin as a separate business in 1936. By March 1936, ten months after the company&#x27;s launch on 30 July 1935, one million Penguin books had been printed.

Only paperback editions were published until the King Penguin series debuted in 1939, and latterly the &quot;Pelican History of Art&quot; was undertaken; these works, considered unsuitable as paperbacks because of their lengths and copious illustrations on art paper, were cloth-bound.

Penguin Books Inc was incorporated in 1939 to satisfy US copyright law; and, despite being a late entrant into an already well established paperback market, enjoyed further success under vice president Kurt Enoch with such titles as &quot;What Plane Is That&quot; and &quot;The New Soldier Handbook&quot;.

The company&#x27;s expansion saw the hiring of Eunice Frost—first as a secretary, then as an editor, and ultimately as a director, who was to have a pivotal influence in shaping the company. In 1945 she was entrusted with the reconstruction of Penguin Inc after the departure of its first managing director, Ian Ballantine.

From the outset, design was essential to Penguin&#x27;s success. Avoiding the illustrated gaudiness of other paperback publishers, Penguin opted for the simple appearance of three horizontal bands, the upper and lower of which were colour-coded according to the series to which the title belonged; this is sometimes referred to as the horizontal grid. In the central white panel, the author and title were printed in Gill Sans, and in the upper band was a cartouche with the legend &quot;Penguin Books&quot;. The initial design was created by then 21-year-old office junior Edward Young, who also drew the first version of the Penguin logo. Series such as Penguin Specials and The Penguin Shakespeare had individual designs (by 1937, only S1 and B1-B18 had been published).

The colour schemes included: orange and white for general fiction, green and white for crime fiction, cerise and white for travel and adventure, dark blue and white for biographies, yellow and white for miscellaneous, red and white for drama; and the rarer purple and white for essays and belles lettres and grey and white for world affairs. Lane actively resisted the introduction of cover images for several years. Some recent publications of literature from that time have duplicated the original look.

In 1937, Penguin&#x27;s headquarters were established at Harmondsworth, Middlesex (now part of Greater London).

==War years==
The Second World War saw Penguin emerge as a national institution. Though it had no formal role in the war effort, it was integral to it thanks to the publication of such bestselling manuals as &quot;Keeping Poultry and Rabbits on Scraps&quot; and &quot;Aircraft Recognition,&quot; and supplying books for the services and British POWs. In the war&#x27;s six years, it printed some 600 titles and started 19 new series. At a time of enormous increase in the demand for books, Penguin enjoyed a privileged place among its peers.

Paper rationing was the besetting problem of publishers in wartime, with the fall of France cutting off supply of esparto grass, one of the constituents of the pulp Penguin used. When rationing was introduced in March 1940, the Ministry of Supply allocated a quota to each publisher as a percentage of the amount that firm used between August 1938 and August 1939. This was particularly advantageous to Penguin, who, as a volume printer, was very successful that year. Further, in a deal with the Canadian Government, Penguin agreed to exclusively publish editions for their armed forces, for which they were paid in tons of paper.

By January 1942 the Book Production War Economy Agreement regulations came into force which determined rules on paper quality, type size and margins. Consequently, Penguin eliminated dust jackets, trimmed margins and replaced sewn bindings with metal staples. Aside from the noticeable deterioration in paperbacks&#x27; appearance, it became a practical impossibility to publish books of more than 256 pages, resulting in some titles falling out of print for want of material. In addition to their paper allocation, in 1941 Penguin secured a deal with the War Office, through Bill William&#x27;s connections with ABCA and CEMA, to supply the troops with books through what was known as the Forces Book Club. Penguin received 60 tons a month from Paper Supply in return for 10 titles a month in runs of 75,000 at 5d.

Originally, every paperback carried the message, &quot;FOR THE FORCES – Leave this book at a Post Office when you have read it, so that men and women in the Services may enjoy it too&quot; at the bottom of the back cover, inviting the reader to take advantage of the Royal Mail&#x27;s free transmission of books to the forces. However, demand exceeded supply on the home front, leading Lane to seek a monopoly on army books made specifically for overseas distribution. Their established paper supply put Penguin in an especially strong position after the war as rationing continued. For this reason, and for the popular prestige the company enjoyed, many of Penguin&#x27;s competitors had no choice but to concede paperback reprint rights to it.

==Post-war history==
In 1945, Penguin began what would become one of its most important branches, the Penguin Classics, with a translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; by E. V. Rieu. Between 1947 and 1949, the German typographer Jan Tschichold redesigned 500 Penguin books, and left Penguin with a set of influential rules of design principles brought together as the &quot;Penguin Composition Rules&quot;, a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. Tschichold&#x27;s work included the woodcut illustrated covers of the classics series (also known as the medallion series), and with Hans Schmoller, his eventual successor at Penguin, the vertical grid covers that became the standard for Penguin fiction throughout the 1950s. By this time the paperback industry in the UK had begun to grow, and Penguin found itself in competition with then fledgeling Pan Books. Many other series were published such as the &quot;Buildings of England&quot;, the &quot;Pelican History of Art&quot; and &quot;Penguin Education&quot;.

In 1949, Harry F. Paroissien (who had been Sir Allen Lane&#x27;s deputy) was sent by him to the United States to set up Penguin Books in Baltimore, Maryland.

By 1960, a number of forces were to shape the direction of the company, the publication list and its graphic design. On 20 April 1961, Penguin became a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange; consequently, Allen Lane had a diminished role at the firm though he was to continue as managing director. New techniques such as phototypesetting and offset-litho printing were to replace hot metal and letterpress printing, dramatically reducing cost and permitting the printing of images and text on the same paper stock, thus paving the way for the introduction of photography and novel approaches to graphic design on paperback covers. In May 1960, Tony Godwin was appointed as editorial adviser, rapidly rising to Chief Editor from which position he sought to broaden the range of Penguin&#x27;s list and keep up with new developments in graphic design. To this end, he hired Germano Facetti in January 1961, who was to decisively alter the appearance of the Penguin brand. Beginning with the crime series, Facetti canvassed the opinion of a number of designers including Romek Marber for a new look to the Penguin cover. It was Marber&#x27;s suggestion of what came to be called the Marber grid along with the retention of traditional Penguin colour-coding that was to replace the previous three horizontal bars design and set the pattern for the design of the company&#x27;s paperbacks for the next twenty years. Facetti rolled out the new treatment across the Penguin line starting with crime, the orange fiction series, then Pelicans, Penguin Modern Classics, Penguin Specials, and Penguin Classics, giving an overall visual unity to the company&#x27;s list. A somewhat different approach was taken to the Peregrine, Penguin Poets, Penguin Modern Poets, and Penguin Plays series. There were over a hundred different series published in total.

Just as Lane well judged the public&#x27;s appetite for paperbacks in the 1930s, his decision to publish &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; by D. H. Lawrence in 1960 boosted Penguin&#x27;s notoriety. The novel was at the time unpublished in the United Kingdom and the predicted obscenity trial, &quot;R v Penguin Books Ltd&quot;, not only marked Penguin as a fearless publisher, it also helped drive the sale of at least 3.5 million copies. Penguin&#x27;s victory in the case heralded the end to the censorship of books in the UK, although censorship of the written word was only finally defeated after the &quot;Inside Linda Lovelace&quot; trial of 1978.

===Pearson takeover===

By the end of the 1960s Penguin was in financial trouble, and several proposals were made for a new operating structure. These included ownership by a consortium of universities, or joint ownership by the Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press, but none of them came to anything. Sir Allen Lane died on 7 July 1970, and six weeks later, Penguin was acquired by Pearson PLC on 21 August 1970. A new emphasis on profitability emerged and, with the departure of Facetti in 1972, the defining era of Penguin book design came to an end.

Penguin merged with long-established U.S. publisher Viking Press in 1975.

The first Penguin Bookshop opened in Covent Garden in 1980.

In 1985, Penguin purchased British hardback publisher Michael Joseph and in 1986, Hamish Hamilton. After these acquisitions, Penguin moved its offices to central London (27 Wrights Lane, W8 5TZ). Thus &#x27;Harmondsworth&#x27; disappeared as the place of publication after half a century. (The warehouse at Harmondsworth would remain in operation until 2004.)

Also in 1986, Penguin purchased American publisher New American Library (NAL) and its hard-cover affiliate E. P. Dutton. New American Library had originally been Penguin U.S.A. and had been spun off in 1948 because of the high complexity of import and export regulations. Penguin repurchased it in order to extend its reach into the US market, and NAL saw the move as a way to gain a hold in international markets.

Penguin published Deborah Lipstadt&#x27;s book &quot;Denying the Holocaust&quot;, which accused David Irving of Holocaust denial. Irving sued Lipstadt and Penguin for libel in 1998 but lost in a much publicised court case. Other titles published by Penguin which gained media attention, and controversy, include &quot;Massacre&quot; by Siné, &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, which was suppressed in the UK by the government for a time, and &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, leading to its author Salman Rushdie having to go into hiding for some years after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a &quot;Fatwā&quot;, an edict amounting to a sentence of death against him.

In 2006, Penguin attempted to involve the public in collaboratively writing a novel on a wiki platform. They named this project A Million Penguins. On 7 March 2007, the Penguin Books UK blog announced that the project had come to an end.

In 2014, the Penguin Hotline was created by Madeline McIntosh. An orange commemorative plaque was unveiled at Exeter train station in May 2017 to mark Lane&#x27;s significant contribution to the publishing industry.

==Imprints and series==
===Penguin Classics===


Consonant with Penguin&#x27;s corporate mission to bring canonical literature to the mass market, the company first ventured into publishing the classics in May 1938 with the issue of &quot;Penguin Illustrated Classics&quot;. The savings from the author&#x27;s payments on these royalty-free titles were instead invested in commissioning wood-engravings from Robert Gibbings and his circle emanating from the Central School of Arts and Crafts. The books were distinct from the rest of the Penguin marque in their use of a vertical grid (anticipating Tschichold&#x27;s innovation of 1951) and albertus typeface. The series was not a financial success and the list ceased after just ten volumes the same year it began. Penguin returned to classics with the printing of E. V. Rieu&#x27;s translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; in 1946, which went on to sell three million copies.

Penguin&#x27;s commercial motivation was, as ever, populist; rendering the classics in an approachable modern English was therefore a difficult task whose execution did not always satisfy the critics. Rieu said of his work that &quot;I have done my best to make Homer easy reading for those who are unfamiliar with the Greek world.&quot; He was joined in 1959 by Betty Radice who was first his assistant then, after his retirement in 1964, she assumed the role of joint editor with Robert Baldick. As the publisher&#x27;s focus changed from the needs of the marketplace to those of the classroom the criticism became more acute, Thomas Gould wrote of the series &quot;most of the philosophical volumes in the Penguin series are bad – some very bad indeed. Since Plato and Aristotle are the most read philosophers in the world today, and since some of these Penguin translations are favourites among professional philosophers in several countries, this amounts to a minor crisis in the history of philosophy.&quot;

The imprint publishes hundreds of classics from the Greeks and Romans to Victorian Literature to modern classics. For nearly twenty years, variously coloured borders to the front and back covers indicated the original language. The second period of design meant largely black covers with a colour illustration on the front. In 2002, Penguin announced it was redesigning its entire catalogue, merging the original Classics list (known in the trade as &quot;Black Classics&quot;) with what had been the old Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics list, though the silver covers for the latter have so far been retained for most of the titles. Previously this line had been called &#x27;Penguin Modern Classics&#x27; with a pale green livery.

The redesign – featuring a colourful painting on the cover, with black background and orange lettering – was well received. However, the quality of the paperbacks themselves seemed to decrease: the spines were more likely to fold and bend. The paperbacks are also printed on non-acid-free pulp paper, which, by some accounts, tends to yellow and brown within a couple of years.

The text page design was also overhauled to follow a more closely prescribed template, allowing for faster copyediting and typesetting, but reducing the options for individual design variations suggested by a text&#x27;s structure or historical context (for example, in the choice of text typeface). Prior to 2002, the text page typography of each book in the Classics series had been overseen by a team of in-house designers; this department was drastically reduced in 2003 as part of the production costs. The in-house text design department still exists, albeit much smaller than formerly. Recent design work includes the Penguin Little Black Classic series, designed by Claire Mason.

===Pelican Books===

Lane expanded the business in 1937 with the publication of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligent Woman&#x27;s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism&quot; under the Pelican Books imprint, an imprint designed to educate the reading public rather than entertain. Recognising his own limitations Lane appointed V. K. Krishna Menon as the first commissioning editor of the series, supported by an advisory panel consisting of Peter Chalmers Mitchell, H. L. Bales and W. E. Williams. Several thousand Pelicans were published over the next half-century and brought high quality accounts of the current state of knowledge in many fields, often written by authors of specialised academic books. (The Pelican series, in decline for several years, was finally discontinued in 1984.)

&quot;Aircraft Recognition&quot; (S82) by R. A. Saville-Sneath, was a bestseller. In 1940, the children&#x27;s imprint Puffin Books began with a series of non-fiction picture books; the first work of children&#x27;s fiction published under the imprint was Barbara Euphan Todd&#x27;s &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; the following year. Another series that began in wartime was the &quot;Penguin Poets&quot;: the first volume was a selection of Tennyson&#x27;s poems (D1) in 1941. Later examples are &quot;The Penguin Book of Modern American Verse&quot; (D22), 1954, and &quot;The Penguin Book of Restoration Verse&quot; (D108), 1968. J. M. Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Comic and Curious Verse&quot; appeared in three volumes over a number of years.

Pelican Books was relaunched as a digital imprint in 2014, with four books published simultaneously on 1 May: &quot;Economics: A User&#x27;s Guide&quot; by Ha-Joon Chang, &quot;The Domesticated Brain&quot; by the psychologist Bruce Hood, &quot;Revolutionary Russia&quot; by Orlando Figes and &quot;Human Evolution&quot; by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar.

===Penguin Education===
In 1965 Penguin entered the field of educational publishing, Allen Lane&#x27;s aim being to carry the radical and populist spirit of Pelicans into the schoolbook market. His final major initiative, the division was established as a separate publishing operation from Harmondsworth, and based in West Drayton in Middlesex. During its nine-year life it had a major impact on school books, breaking new ground in their concept and design and strongly influencing other publishers&#x27; lists.

Among the most successful and influential series were Voices and Junior Voices, Connexions, and the Penguin English Project. Alongside these and other series, the imprint continued another Penguin tradition by producing Education Specials, titles which focussed on often controversial topics within education and beyond. They included highly topical books such as &quot;The Hornsey Affair&quot; and &quot;Warwick University Ltd&quot;, reflecting the student unrest of the late 1960s and contributing to the intense national debate about the purpose of higher education. Other titles featured the radical and influential ideas about schooling propounded by writers and teachers from America and elsewhere.

Penguin Education also published an extensive range of Readers and introductory texts for students in higher education, notably in subjects such as psychology, economics, management, sociology and science, while for teachers it provided a series of key texts such as &quot;Language, the Learner and the School&quot; and &quot;The Language of Primary School Children&quot;. Following Allen Lane&#x27;s death in 1970 and the takeover the same year by Pearson Longman, the division discontinued publishing school books and was closed in March 1974. More than 80 teachers, educational journalists and academics signed a letter to the Times Educational Supplement regretting the closure of the influential imprint.

===Penguin Specials===
In November 1937, Penguin inaugurated a new series of short, polemical books under the rubric of &quot;Penguin Specials&quot; with the publication of Edgar Mowrer&#x27;s &quot;Germany Puts the Clock Back&quot;. Their purpose was to offer in-depth analysis of current affairs that would counter the perceived bias of the newspapers in addition to being the company&#x27;s response to the popularity of Gollancz&#x27;s Left Book Club. Whereas the Left Book Club was avowedly pro-Soviet, Penguin and Lane expressed no political preference as their editorial policy, though the widespread belief was that the series was left-leaning since the editor was the communist John Lehmann and its authors were, with a few exceptions, men of the left. Speed of publication and delivery (a turnaround of weeks rather than months) were essential to the topicality and therefore success of the Specials, Genevieve Tabouis&#x27;s anti-appeasement tract &quot;Blackmail or War&quot; sold over 200,000 copies for example. However even this immediacy did not prevent them being overtaken by events: Shiela Grant Duff&#x27;s &quot;Europe and the Czechs&quot; only made it onto the bookstands on the day of the Munich agreement, but nevertheless went on to be a bestseller. Thirty-five Penguin Specials were published before the outbreak of war, including two novels Hašek&#x27;s &quot;Good Soldier Schweik&quot; and Bottome&#x27;s &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot;; they collectively made a significant contribution to the public debate of the time, with many of the more controversial titles being the subject of leading articles in the press.

After a hiatus between 1945 and 1949, the &quot;Penguin Specials&quot; continued after the war under the editorship of first Tom Maschler, then after 1961 Tony Godwin. The first title in the revived series was William Gallacher&#x27;s &quot;The Case for Communism&quot;. Godwin initiated the &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Britain&quot; series of Specials in the run up to the 1964 election, which constituted a platform for the New Left&#x27;s brand of cultural analysis that characterised the leftist political radicalism of the 1960s. Indeed, Penguin Books contributed to the funds that set up Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall&#x27;s Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University in 1964. This brief period of revival for Penguin Specials in contributing to the national dialogue was not sustained after the departure of Godwin in 1967, and with the rise in television journalism the Specials series declined in significance through the 1970s and 1980s. The last Special was published in 1988 with Keith Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Under Siege: Racism and Violence in Britain Today&quot;.

In December 2011, Penguin launched nine titles as &#x27;Penguin Shorts&#x27; which featured the iconic tri-band covers. These books were novellas and short length works of fiction and/or memoirs. In 2012 they became known as Penguin Specials following an agreement with The Economist made in March of that year. These works focused on the kind of topical journalism that was a feature of the original Penguin Specials. Subsequent Penguin Specials released in 2012 and 2013 continued to include both fiction, including the publication of the works shortlisted for the Monash Undergraduate Prize 2012, and topical journalism. Collected columns of cultural critics were also featured.

===Puffin===

Noel Carrington, an editor at &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine, first approached Lane with the idea of publishing low-cost, illustrated non-fiction children&#x27;s books in 1938. Inspired by the Editions Père Castor books drawn by Rojan and the technique of autolithography used in the poster art of the time, Carrington&#x27;s suggestion for what was to become the &quot;Puffin Picture Book&quot; series was adopted by Penguin in 1940 when, as Lane saw it, evacuated city children would need books on farming and natural history to help adjust to the country. The first four titles appeared in December 1940; &quot;War on Land&quot;, &quot;War at Sea&quot;, &quot;War in the Air&quot; and &quot;On the Farm&quot;, and a further nine the following year. Despite Lane&#x27;s intention to publish twelve a year paper and staff shortages meant only thirteen were issued in the first two years of the series. The Picture Books&#x27; 120 titles resulted in 260 variants altogether, the last number 116 Paxton Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Life Histories&quot;, was issued &quot;hors série&quot; in 1996 by the Penguin Collector&#x27;s Society.

Inexpensive paperback children&#x27;s fiction did not exist at the time Penguin sought to expand their list into this new market. To this end Eleanor Graham was appointed in 1941 as the first editor of the &quot;Puffin Story Books&quot; series, a venture made particularly difficult due to the resistance of publishers and librarians in releasing the rights of their children&#x27;s books. The first five titles (&quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;, &quot;Cornish Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Cuckoo Clock&quot;, &quot;Garram the Hunter&quot; and &quot;Smokey)&quot; were published in the three horizontal stripes company livery of the rest of the Penguin output, a practice abandoned after the ninth volume when full-bleed colour illustrated covers were introduced, a fact that heralded the much greater design freedom of the Puffin series over the rest of Penguin&#x27;s books.

Graham retired in 1961 and was replaced by Kaye Webb who presided over the department for 18 years in a period that saw greatly increased competition in the children&#x27;s market as well as a greater sophistication in production and marketing. One innovation of Webb&#x27;s was the creation of the Puffin Club in 1967 and its quarterly magazine &quot;Puffin Post&quot;, which at its height had 200,000 members. The Puffin authors&#x27; list added Arthur Ransome, Roald Dahl and Ursula K. Le Guin during Webb&#x27;s editorship and saw the creation of the Peacock series of teenage fiction.

Tony Lacey took over Webb&#x27;s editorial chair in 1979 at the invitation of Penguin managing director Peter Mayer when Puffin was one of the few profitable divisions of the beleaguered company. In line with Mayer&#x27;s policy of more aggressive commercialisation of the Penguin brand Lacey reduced the number of Puffin imprints, consolidated popular titles under the Puffin Classics rubric and inaugurated the successful interactive gamebook series Fighting Fantasy. Complementary to the Puffin Club the Puffin School Book Club, addressed specifically to schools and organisations, grew significantly in this period helping to confirm Puffin market position such that by 1983 one in three Penguin books sold was a Puffin.

===The Buildings of England===

Nikolaus Pevsner first proposed a series of volumes amounting to a county by county survey of the monuments of England in ten or more books to both the Cambridge University Press and Routledge before the war, however for various reason his plan came to nothing. It was only through his involvement with Penguin that he was in a position to make a similar suggestion to Allen Lane and be accepted. Pevsner described the project of the Buildings of England as an attempt to fill the gap in English publishing for those multi-volume survey of national art familiar on the continent. In particular Georg Dehio&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmaler&quot;, a topographical inventory of Germany&#x27;s important historic buildings that was published in five volumes between 1905 and 1912. Though Pevsner&#x27;s ambition for the series was to educate and inform the general public on the subtleties of English architectural history, the immediate commercial imperative was competition with the Shell Guides edited by John Betjeman of which 13 had been published by 1939. With Lane&#x27;s agreement in 1945 Pevsner began work personally touring the county that was to be the subject of observation aided by notes drawn up by researchers. The first volume, &quot;Cornwall&quot;, appeared in 1951, and went on to produce 46 architectural guidebooks between then and 1974 of which he wrote 32 alone and ten with assistance. As early as 1954 the series was in commercial difficulty and required sponsorship to continue, a grant from the Leverhulme Trust amongst other sources secured its completion. The series continued after Pevsner&#x27;s death in 1983, financed in part by the Pevsner Books Trust and published by Yale University Press.

Pevsner&#x27;s approach was of &quot;Kunstgeschichte&quot; quite distinct from the antiquarian interest of local and family history typical of English county histories. Consequently, there is little mention of monumental brasses, bells, tracery, the relationship of the building to the landscape. Nor is there much discussion on building techniques, nor industrial architecture, nor on Art Deco buildings, omissions that his critics hold have led to those subjects undervaluation and neglect. Nevertheless, Pevsner&#x27;s synoptic study brought rigorous architectural history to an appreciative mass audience, and in particular he enlarged the perception of the Victorian achievement in architecture.

===Magazine publishing===
Wartime paper rationing, which had resulted in a generous allocation to Penguin, also forced the reduction in space for book reviews and advertising in the newspapers and was partly the cause of the folding of several literary journals, consequently left a gap in the magazine market that Lane hoped to fill. In January 1941 the first issue of &quot;Penguin New Writing&quot; appeared and instantly dominated the market with 80,000 copies sold compared to its closest rival, Cyril Connolly&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot;, which mustered 3,500 sales in its first edition. &quot;Penguin New Writing&quot;&#x27;s editor John Lehmann was instrumental in introducing the British public to such new writers as Lawrence Durrell, Saul Bellow and James Michie. Yet despite popular and critical success further rationing and, after 1945 declining sales, led monthly publication to become quarterly until the journal finally closed in autumn 1950 after 40 issues.

Though &quot;New Writing&quot; was the most durable of Penguin&#x27;s periodicals it wasn&#x27;t the publisher&#x27;s only foray into journalism with &quot;Russian Review&quot;, &quot;Penguin Hansard&quot; and &quot;Transatlantic&quot; begun during the war, and &quot;Penguin Film Review&quot;, &quot;Penguin Music Magazine&quot;, &quot;New Biology&quot; (1945–1960), &quot;Penguin Parade&quot;, &quot;Penguin Science Survey&quot; and &quot;Penguin Science News&quot; having brief runs after 1945.

As of the 2020s, the publication &quot;The Happy Reader&quot; retails in Europe.

===Popular Penguins===
Penguin&#x27;s Australian subsidiary released the Popular Penguins series late in 2008. The series has its own website. It was intended to include 50 titles, many of which duplicate those on the Penguin Celebrations list but this was reduced to 49 titles as one of the 50, &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; by Noam Chomsky, had to be withdrawn after its initial release as Penguin discovered they no longer held the rights to it.

Popular Penguins are presented as a return to Lane&#x27;s original ethos good books at affordable prices. They have been published with a cover price of A$9.95, less than half of the average price of a paperback novel in Australia at the time of release.

Popular Penguins are presented in a more &quot;authentic&quot; interpretation of the Penguin Grid than that of the Celebrations series. They are correct size, when compared to an original &#x27;grid-era&#x27; Penguin, and they use Eric Gill&#x27;s typefaces in a more or less exact match for Jan Tschichold&#x27;s &quot;tidying&quot; of Edward Young&#x27;s original three panel cover design. The covers are also printed on a card stock that mirrors the look and feel of 1940s and 50s Penguin covers. On the other hand, all of the Popular Penguins series are in Penguin Orange, and not colour-coded in the manner of the original designs and the &quot;Celebrations&quot; titles.

In July 2009, another 50 Popular Penguins were released onto the Australian and New Zealand markets. A further 10 titles written by New Zealand authors were released in March 2010. Another 75 titles were released in Australia in July 2010 to mark Penguin&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

===King Penguin Books===
King Penguin Books was a series of pocket-sized monographs published by Penguin Books between 1939 and 1959. They were in imitation of the Insel-Bücherei series published in Germany by Insel Verlag from 1912 onwards, and were pioneer volumes for Penguins in that they were their first volumes with hard covers and their first with colour printing.
The books originally combined a classic series of colour plates with an authoritative text. The first two volumes featured sixteen plates from John Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of Great Britain&quot; (1873) with historical introduction and commentary on each plate by Phyllis Barclay-Smith, and sixteen plates from Pierre-Joseph Redouté&#x27;s &quot;Roses&quot; (1817–24) with historical introduction and commentary by John Ramsbottom. The third volume began the alternative practice of colour plates from a variety of sources.

Some of the volumes, such as Nikolaus Pevsner&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Southwell&quot; (1945) or Wilfrid Blunt&#x27;s &quot;Tulipomania&quot; (1950) were pioneering works of scholarship. Others such as &quot;The Bayeux Tapestry&quot; by Eric Maclagan (1943), &quot;Ur : The First Phases&quot; by Leonard Woolley (1946) or &quot;Russian Icons&quot; (1947) by David Talbot Rice were distillations by experts of their own pioneering works. Some volumes by experts went into revised editions, such as &quot;A Book of English Clocks&quot; (1947 and 1950) by R. W. Symonds.

Elizabeth Senior edited the series until 1941, after which Nikolaus Pevsner took over and remained editor until the end of the series. The series ran to 76 volumes.

The King Penguin imprint was briefly revived in 1981 for a series of contemporary works, chiefly fiction.

===Pelican History of Art===
Allen Lane approached Nikolaus Pevsner in 1945 for a series of illustrated books that would match the success of the King Penguins. Pevsner recalled his response: &quot;Allen said, &#x27;You have done the King Penguins now and we are going on with them, but if you had your way, what else would you do?&#x27; I had my answer ready—and the answer was very formidable, because I outlined both &quot;The Pelican History of Art&quot; and &quot;The Buildings of England&quot; on the spot, each about 40 to 50 volumes. Allen said, &#x27;Yes, we can do both,&#x27; and that was the end of the meeting.&quot; Pevsner&#x27;s industry quickly bore fruit with the first contracts signed by 1946 for John Summerson&#x27;s &quot;Architecture in Britain&quot;, Anthony Blunt&#x27;s &quot;Art and Architecture in France&quot;, and Rudolf Wittkower&#x27;s &quot;Italian art and architecture&quot;, the first title &quot;Painting in Britain, 1530–1790&quot; by Ellis Waterhouse was issued in 1953. By 1955, Pevsner produced a prospectus for the series announcing the publication of four new volumes and a plan for the rest of the series totalling 47 titles. The ambition of the series exceeded previously published multi-volume histories of art such as André Michel&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;art&quot; (17 vols., 1905–28), the &quot;Propyläen Kunstgeschichte&quot; (25 vols., 1923–35). Forty-one volumes were published by the time Pevsner retired from editing in 1977. His work was continued by Judy Nairn (his editorial assistant on the &quot;Buildings of England&quot;) and the medievalist Peter Lasko. Yale University Press acquired the series in 1992 when 45 titles had been completed; by 2004 they had published 21 volumes, mostly revisions of existing editions. New volumes continue to be produced in the 2010s, and new editions of older ones.

For Penguin the series was a departure from their commercial mainstay of paperbacks as the histories of art were the first large format, illustrated hardback books they had produced. Despite their relatively high price they were a financial success, yet for Pevsner they were intended primarily as graduate level texts in what was, for the English speaking world, the newly emerging academic discipline of art history. Nevertheless, the series was criticised from within the academy for its evident biases. Many of its authors were German émigrés, consequently there was a methodological preference for the &quot;kunstwissenschaft&quot; practiced in Vienna and Berlin between the wars; a formalism that ignored the social context of art. Moreover, the weight given to some subjects seemed disproportionate to some critics, with seven of its 47 volumes dedicated to English art, a &quot;tributary of the main European current&quot; as the &quot;Burlington Magazine&quot; observed. Though the 1955 plan was never fully executed—the volumes on Greek painting and sculpture, quattrocento painting and cinquecento sculpture were not written—the Pelican History remains one of the most comprehensive surveys of world art published.

<text>Forchess is a four-player chess variant developed by T. K. Rogers, an American engineer. It uses one standard chessboard and two sets of standard pieces.

==History and motivation==
Forchess was developed around the year 1975. Its inventor T. K. Rogers wanted to create a pure strategy game with the social dynamic of card games like Bridge. Rogers believed in the educational merits of chess and felt that making the game a more popular social activity would benefit society.

Rogers wanted the game to use only standard pieces and a standard board so that everything necessary to play would be readily available. He also did not want to severely limit the number of pieces each player had.

In 1992, Rogers published the instruction set as a 64-page booklet &quot;Forchess: The Ultimate Social Game&quot;, designed to fit in a shirt pocket. The booklet also contained strategies for playing the game and a new technique invented by Rogers for analyzing both chess and Forchess games. He called it influence indicator.

In 1996, Rogers posted a free instruction set on the then newly founded Intuitor website. He simultaneously began distributing thousands of free instruction brochures to schools and colleges.

==Overview of the game==

The game is played by four people in teams of two. At the outset, each player controls an entire quadrant of the board with a full set of chess pieces (minus one pawn). Partners occupy quadrants diagonally across from each other. The diagram at right shows the initial layout of the Forchess board (K=King, Q=Queen, R=Rook, B=Bishop, N=Knight, and P=Pawn). Four squares are initially unoccupied.

All the pieces move and capture in the same manner as conventional chess, except the pawn, which moves diagonally and captures laterally. A pawn may not move two squares at a time, and there is no en passant capture. There are no checkmates and no stalemates: kings are captured like all other pieces. When a player is in check and has no legal moves to escape check, he may make a &quot;token move&quot; every turn until his king is actually captured. When a player loses his king, his remaining pieces subsequently become the captor&#x27;s. The game ends when one team has lost both kings or chooses to concede.

Partners typically coordinate their moves as part of a single strategy. Thus, communication of that strategy becomes a requirement of the game. Clandestine forms of communication such as code words, furtive gestures, or secret notes are not allowed, except in special variants. All strategizing between partners must be done openly in front of their opponents. This rule lends Forchess much of its social character.

==Cutthroat Forchess==
Forchess has a variant called Cutthroat, in which there are no partners and only one player wins by defeating all three opponents. Successful strategy in Cutthroat Forchess can differ greatly from &quot;regular&quot; Forchess, as fluid alliances may spark a game of psychological manipulation. In this respect, Cutthroat shares strategy elements with the board game Risk.

<text>Michael Bolotin (born February 26, 1953), known professionally as Michael Bolton, is an American singer and songwriter. Bolton performed in the hard rock and heavy metal music genres from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, both on his early solo albums and those he recorded as the frontman of the band Blackjack. His early career also saw him as a successful songwriter, co-writing hits like &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; for Laura Branigan, which he later recorded as a solo single.

Bolton achieved peak recognition as a pop ballad singer in the late 1980s and early 1990s with notable collaborations with songwriters like Diane Warren and Desmond Child. During that time, he covered such songs as Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; and Percy Sledge&#x27;s &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;. Despite his commercial success in the adult contemporary genre, Bolton faced criticism for being derivative. In 2000, he faced a controversial legal battle with the Isley Brothers over plagiarism, which resulted in a substantial financial settlement.

In later years, he ventured into various other media, including television and film, often appearing as himself. Bolton also participated in &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and produced the documentary &quot;American Dream: Detroit&quot;. His personal life includes a long-term relationship and broken engagement with actress Nicollette Sheridan and a 15-year marriage to Maureen McGuire, with whom he has three daughters. Bolton is also known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly through The Michael Bolton Charities, although he has faced criticism over the way funds raised by the organization have been allocated. He has been recognized for his contributions to music and charity, including receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Bolton has sold more than 75 million records, and recorded eight top 10 albums and two number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, as well as winning six American Music Awards and two Grammy Awards. He has performed with artists including Lucia Aliberti, Patti LaBelle, José Carreras, Tony Cetinski, Ray Charles, Celine Dion, Plácido Domingo, Renée Fleming, Wynonna Judd, B.B. King, The Lonely Island, Luciano Pavarotti, Percy Sledge, and Zucchero.

==Early life==
Bolton was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, George Bolotin, was a local official in the Democratic Party, and his mother, Helen, was a homemaker. He has a brother, Orrin, and a sister, Sandra. By age 7, Bolton was able to play the saxophone. He began writing songs at age 9. At age 14, he formed a group, the Nomads, that were signed to a singles contract by Epic Records when Bolton was 16. With his parents&#x27; permission, he dropped out of high school and left home at age 15 to travel cross country along U.S. Route 66 and pursue music full-time. He took odd jobs, including as Paula Abdul’s babysitter.

==Music career==
===Hard rock and songwriting===
Bolton began recording in 1975 at The Church Studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This first album was self-titled using his original family name of Bolotin. Early in his musical career, he focused on hard rock, with his band Blackjack once opening for heavy metal artist Ozzy Osbourne on tour. It was rumored that in 1983 Bolton auditioned for, but was denied, the lead vocalist position with Osbourne&#x27;s former band, Black Sabbath. Bolton later stated this was untrue, saying &quot;That rumor about me auditioning for Black Sabbath was only a rumor, I don&#x27;t know how on earth it started.&quot; In 2004, Bolton&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s the Power of Love&quot; with Blackjack was sampled by rapper Kanye West for his song &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;.

After anglicizing his family name to Bolton, he gained his first major hit as a songwriter, co-writing &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; for Laura Branigan, previously best known for singing the pop hit &quot;Gloria&quot;. Narrowly missing the Top 10 on the US pop chart, Branigan took the song to number one on the Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks in 1983. The two sought to work with each other again, and their next collaboration was when Bolton co-wrote &quot;I Found Someone&quot; for Branigan in 1985. Her version was only a minor hit, but two years later, Cher resurrected the song, and with it her own singing career. Bolton co-wrote several other songs for both singers. Bolton recorded his own rendition of &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; in 1988, which reached number one on the Hot 100.

===Peak success===

Bolton achieved his greatest success as a pop singer in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He performed songs written by or co-written with major hit songwriters of the era including Diane Warren and Desmond Child (as well as &quot;Steel Bars&quot; penned by Bolton and Bob Dylan), but also had several hits that were remakes of 1960s soul classics. One of his first major hits was his 1987 interpretation of the Otis Redding classic &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) the Dock of the Bay&quot;. Redding&#x27;s widow, Zelma Redding, said she was so moved by Bolton&#x27;s performance &quot;that it brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me so much of my husband that I know if he heard it, he would feel the same.&quot; Always interested in soul music and Motown classics, Bolton had a 1989 hit with a version of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, a song associated with Ray Charles. In 1991, he released the album &quot;Time, Love &amp; Tenderness&quot; which featured his Grammy Award-winning cover version of &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, first recorded by Percy Sledge.

From 1987 to 1995, Bolton had four top ten albums and seven top ten songs in the U.S. He had even greater success on the adult contemporary chart with where her had a string of 14 consecutive top ten hits including eight number ones.

Bolton also had 12 top ten songs in Canada, but was less successful outside of North America with four top ten singles in the UK and a few others in various other European countries.

Bolton&#x27;s work during the period has been criticized for being derivative, and in 1992, the Isley Brothers filed a lawsuit against Bolton, claiming his 1991 hit song &quot;Love Is a Wonderful Thing&quot; plagiarized their 1966 song of the same name. A fifteen-year legal battle resulted in a $4.2 million payment to the Isleys from Bolton, his co-writer and their publisher. A previous similar lawsuit regarding &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; had been settled in Bolton&#x27;s favor.
Bolton&#x27;s last Top 40 single in the US was the 1997 hit &quot;Go the Distance&quot; (from the Disney animated movie &quot;Hercules&quot;), which peaked at No. 1 on the US adult contemporary chart. He hired conductor Larry Baird, the orchestral musical director, conductor, and arranger for The Moody Blues, Three Dog Night, and Al Jarreau, for his 2001 tour.

===Later work===
Bolton&#x27;s popularity declined in the late 1990s, but he continued to have adult contemporary hits through the mid-2000s. He released albums every year or two through the mid-2010s. His album &quot;Only a Woman Like You&quot; was released in 2001 with the title song co-written by Shania Twain. In 2006, Bolton and Nicollette Sheridan, his fiancée at the time, sang a duet, &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, for the album &quot;Bolton Swings Sinatra&quot;. For &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, an album which was recorded in five days, Bolton recorded the song &quot;New York, New York&quot;, which was also on his &quot;Bolton Swings Sinatra&quot; album. This was for an episode of the TV series, &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot;. The proceeds from the album went to children&#x27;s hospices across the UK. Bolton released his album &quot;One World One Love&quot; in the UK on September 21, 2009. The first single, &quot;Just One Love&quot;, was released one week earlier. In June 2011, Bolton collaborated with Indian musician A. R. Rahman for a song recorded for &quot;Gems – The Duets Collection&quot;. In 2013, Bolton released the album &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough: A Tribute to Hitsville U.S.A.&quot;, which featured duets with Kelly Rowland, Melanie Fiona and Orianthi.
In addition to his recordings, Bolton has continued to perform publicly. In March 2007, he toured South Africa for the first time, where he was the headline act at Jacaranda 94.2 FM&#x27;s two-day concert. He performed a duet entitled &quot;Il Mio Amico&quot; with the Italian singer Anna Tatangelo at the Sanremo Music Festival 2008. The song was originally sung by Tatangelo alone, but the duet version contained English lyrics as well.

In May 2011, Bolton was featured as a guest vocalist in The Lonely Island&#x27;s song &quot;Jack Sparrow&quot; on their &quot;Turtleneck &amp; Chain&quot; album. His performance with the comedic hip-hop trio focused on his (intentionally) off-topic chorus and miscommunication with the group, and the video featured him dressed in costumes as Jack Sparrow from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, Forrest Gump, Erin Brockovich, and Tony Montana from &quot;Scarface&quot;. He later appeared in the group&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;&quot;, and appears on the film&#x27;s as a guest vocalist on the song &quot;Incredible Thoughts.&quot;

Bolton has also performed his music in other media. In August 2006, Bolton he one of Lucy Lawless&#x27;s duet partners on the Fox Broadcasting Company network&#x27;s program &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;, which Simon Cowell&#x27;s Syco Productions Company produced for the network. In late 2013 and early 2014, he appeared in Honda commercials in which he sings. In 2015, he sang on an episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; concerning the IRS. In the same year, he performed in a Pizza Hut commercial singing &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; while a family opens up their pizza order. Bolton contributed &quot;Upbeat Inspirational Song About Life&quot; and its reprise to &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot;, which was released on July 27, 2018. He also voices the Tiger that sings the song in the film.

In 2021, he guest-starred in season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; where he sang Marvin Gaye &amp; Tammi Terrell &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot; with Faith Evans as &quot;Skunk&quot;. In 2023, he competed in season nine as &quot;Wolf&quot;. After he was eliminated on &quot;DC Superheroes Night&quot;, he took the time to promote his upcoming album and did an encore by performing &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot;.

Bolton competed in the &quot;American Song Contest&quot;, representing Connecticut and performing the song &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, with his first performance in the first week, on March 21, 2022. He made it to the finals, finishing in seventh place.

==Film career==
Bolton has made several cameo appearances in feature films and television, usually appearing as himself, such as in &quot;Meet Wally Sparks&quot; (1997), &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1998).

In September 2010, Bolton was a contestant on the 11th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He and his dance partner Chelsie Hightower were the second couple to be eliminated, on September 28, 2010.

On May 15, 2018, &quot;American Dream: Detroit&quot;, a documentary produced by Bolton, premiered in the Redford Theatre. Bolton loves Detroit and wanted to highlight its economic comeback. The documentary features interviews with several business moguls, singers and other Detroit natives, including Christopher Ilitch, Jerry Bruckheimer, Francis Ford Coppola, Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, and Alice Cooper.

Although he has been rumored to have appeared as an extra in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) as a &quot;spice-eyed&quot; drummer, Bolton has stated in interviews that it is not him.

==Personal life==
Bolton describes himself as a &quot;rebel Jew&quot;. He was raised in a liberal family, and describes his childhood home as having been decorated with both a Hanukkah menorah and a Christmas tree during the holidays. His grandparents kept a kosher household. He left Hebrew school at age 12 when his rabbi forbade him from returning unless he stopped joking around. Nevertheless, Bolton became a bar mitzvah at age 13 and has said he maintains some beliefs in Judaism.

Bolton has been a vegetarian since 1970.

In January 2013, Bolton published an autobiography, &quot;The Soul of It All: My Music, My Life&quot;.

In January 2024, Bolton announced he had undergone emergency surgery for a brain tumor before the December 2023 holidays, and would take a break from touring for the rest of the year. He also added that the surgery had been &quot;a success&quot;. 

Bolton lives in Westport, Connecticut. 

===Relationships and family===
Bolton was married to Maureen McGuire from 1975 to 1990. They have three daughters together, each born two years apart: Isa, Holly, and Taryn. He became a grandfather for the first time in October 2010, through his daughter Taryn. As of February 2019, he had six grandchildren.

Bolton was introduced to actress Nicollette Sheridan in 1992 by adult contemporary/jazz saxophonist Kenny G. Bolton and Sheridan dated until breaking up in 1995. They reunited again in 2005 and became engaged in March 2006. However, it was confirmed in August 2008 that they had broken off their engagement.

==Philanthropy==
In 1993, Bolton established The Michael Bolton Foundation, later renamed The Michael Bolton Charities, to assist women and children at risk from the effects of poverty as well as emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. In the late 1990s, the charity was heavily criticized for the low percentage of contributions that went towards charity work. In 1995 only 15% of the $2.6 million that the foundation raised went to charity, with most of the funds paying for a concert headlined by Bolton.

Bolton and the foundation have had a long-running relationship with former Republican Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland; Rowland steered state funding to Bolton’s charity. In 1995, Bolton performed at a fundraiser for Rowland after the foundation received a grant of $300,000 from the state. In 2014, when Rowland was about to be sentenced for honest-services fraud, mail fraud and tax fraud, Bolton wrote a letter in support of Rowland to the judge who was assigned to sentence Rowland. The foundation accepts grant proposals by invitation only.

Bolton also serves as the honorary chairman of Prevent Child Abuse America and the national chairman for This Close for Cancer Research, and he is a member of the boards of the National Mentoring Partnership and the Joe DiMaggio Children&#x27;s Hospital.

On July 25, 1993, Bolton played against Michael Jordan in a televised charity softball game at the Chicago White Sox stadium, Comiskey Park. Bolton&#x27;s team, The Bolton Bombers, composed of Bolton and his band, won the game 7–1 against Jordan&#x27;s team, Jordan&#x27;s Air Force, which was composed of celebrities including Magic Johnson, Chris Chelios, Ahmad Rashad, Evander Holyfield, Daniel Baldwin, William Baldwin, Mark Harmon, MC Hammer, Tom Selleck, and Stacey King, with Bo Jackson as coach.

In March 2003, Bolton joined with Lifetime Television, Verizon Wireless, and others to lobby on behalf of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, promoting legislation to provide more assistance for victims of domestic violence, such as affordable housing options.

Bolton has received the Lewis Hine Award from the National Child Labor Committee, the Martin Luther King Award from the Congress of Racial Equality, and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce recognized Bolton with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his musical and charitable contributions.

==Discography==

Since 1975, Bolton has released 24 studio albums and 35 singles. Nine of his singles have peaked at No. 1 on either the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 or the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts in the US.

<text>The Volkswagen Transporter, initially the Type 2, is a range of light commercial vehicles, built as vans, pickups, and cab-and-chassis variants, introduced in 1950 by the German automaker Volkswagen as their second mass-production light motor vehicle series, and inspired by an idea and request from then-Netherlands-VW-importer Ben Pon. 

Known officially (depending on body type) as the Transporter, Kombi or Microbusor informally as the Volkswagen Station Wagon (US), Bus (also US), Camper (UK) or Bulli (Germany), it was initially given the factory designation &#x27;Type 2&#x27;, as it followedand was for decades based onthe original &#x27;Volkswagen&#x27; (&quot;People&#x27;s Car&quot;), which became the VW factory&#x27;s &#x27;Type 1&#x27; after the post-war reboot, and mostly known, in many languages, as the &quot;Beetle&quot;.
The Volkswagen Transporter has been built in many variants. It may be best known for its panel vans, but it was also built as a small bus or minivan, with choices of up to 23 windows and either hinged or sliding side doors. From the first generation, both regular and crew-cab, as well as long- and short-bed pickups, were made, and multiple firms sprang up to manufacture varying designs of camper vans, based on VW&#x27;s Transporter models, to this day.

For the first 40 years, all VW Type 2 variants were forward control, with a VW-Beetle-derived flat-four engine in the rear, and all riding on the same (initial thirty yearsT1 and T2), or similar (T3), wheelbase as the Type 1 Beetle. As a result, all forward-control Type 2 pickups were &quot;either&quot; of standard-cab, long-bed &quot;or&quot; crew-cab, short-bed configuration, and because of the relatively high bed floor (above the rear, flat engine), most pickups came with drop sides in addition to the tailgate. In 1979, the third-generation Type 2 introduced an all-new, more square and boxy body, and in the 1980s also introduced a raised four-wheel-drive bus variant.

From the introduction of the fourth-generation Transporter in 1990, the vehicle layout changed to a more common front-engined oneno longer forward-controland also changed from rear- to front-wheel drive, with four-wheel–drive remaining optional. From then on, the platform no longer shared technological legacy with the Beetle, and Volkswagen just called them &#x27;Transporter&#x27;, and no longer &#x27;Type 2&#x27;. The new models, though growing a bit in length, got a significantly longer wheelbase that pushed the wheels closer to the truck&#x27;s corners, noticeably reducing its front and rear overhangs, and extended-wheelbase models were also introduced.

==Legacy of the Type 2==
As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans, the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s, including the Ford Econoline, the Dodge A100, and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan – the last adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1&#x27;s layout.

European competition included the 1947–1981 Citroën H Van, the 1959–1980 Renault Estafette (both FF layout), the 1952–1969 semi-forward-control Bedford CA and the 1953–1965 FR layout Ford Transit. Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles, such as the Nissan Caravan, Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar. Like the Beetle, the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide, including &quot;microbus&quot;, &quot;minibus&quot;, and, because of its popularity in the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;hippie van&quot; and &quot;hippie bus&quot;.

Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T2 series of Type 2, which ceased production on 31 December 2013, due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country. This (after the 2002 termination of its T3 successor in South Africa) marked the end of the era of rear-engine Volkswagens, which originated in 1935 with their Type 1 prototypes.

== History ==
The concept for the Type 2 is credited to Dutch Volkswagen importer Ben Pon. It has similarities in concept to the 1920s Rumpler Tropfenwagen and 1930s Dymaxion car by Buckminster Fuller, neither of which reached production. Pon visited Wolfsburg in 1946, intending to purchase Type 1s for import to the Netherlands, where he saw a &quot;Plattenwagen&quot;, an improvised parts-mover based on the Type 1 chassis, and realized something better was possible using the stock Type 1 pan. He first sketched the van in a doodle dated 23 April 1947, proposing a payload of and placing the driver at the very front. The sketch is now in the Rijksmuseum. Production would have to wait, however, as the factory was at capacity producing the Type 1.

When capacity freed up, a prototype known internally as the Type 29 was produced in a short three months. The stock Type 1 pan proved to be too weak so the prototype used a ladder chassis with unit body construction. Coincidentally the wheelbase was the same as the Type 1&#x27;s. Engineers reused the reduction gear from the Type 82, enabling the 1.5 ton van to use a flat four engine.

Although the aerodynamics of the first prototypes were poor (with an initial ), engineers used the wind tunnel at the Technical University of Braunschweig to optimize the design. Simple changes such as splitting the windshield and roofline into a &quot;vee&quot; helped the production Type 2 achieve , exceeding the Type 1&#x27;s . Volkswagen&#x27;s new chief executive officer Heinz Nordhoff (appointed 1 January 1948) approved the van for production on 19 May 1949 and the first production model, now designated Type 2, rolled off the assembly line to debut 12 November. Only two models were offered: the Kombi (with two side windows and middle and rear seats that were easily removable by one person), and the Commercial. The Microbus was added in May 1950, joined by the Deluxe Microbus in June 1951. In all 9,541 Type 2s were produced in their first year of production.

An ambulance model was added in December 1951 which repositioned the fuel tank in front of the transaxle, put the spare tire behind the front seat, and added a &quot;tailgate&quot;-style rear door. These features became standard on the Type 2 from 1955 to 1967. 11,805 Type 2s were built in the 1951 model year.
These were joined by a single-cab pickup in August 1952, and it changed the least of the Type 2s until all were heavily modified in 1968.

Unlike other rear engine Volkswagens, which evolved constantly over time but never saw the introduction of all-new models, the Transporter not only evolved, but was completely revised periodically with variations retrospectively referred to as versions &quot;T1&quot; to &quot;T5&quot; (a nomenclature only invented after the introduction of the front-drive T4 which replaced the T3). However, only generations T1 to T3 can be seen as directly related to the Beetle (see below for details).

The Type 2, along with the 1939 Citroën TUB and the 1947 Citroën H Van, are among the first &#x27;forward control&#x27; vans in which the driver was placed above the front roadwheels. They started a trend in Europe, where the 1952 GM Bedford CA, 1958 RAF-977, 1959 Renault Estafette, 1960 BMC Morris J4, and 1960 Commer FC also used the concept. In the United States, the Corvair-based Chevrolet Corvan cargo van and Greenbrier passenger van adopted the use of the rear-engine layout of the Corvair car in the same manner that the Type 2 had used the rear-engine layout of the Type 1, using the Corvair&#x27;s horizontally opposed, 6 cylinder air-cooled engine for power. Except for the Greenbrier, various 1950s–70s Fiat minivans, and the Mazda Bongo, the Type 2 remained unique in being rear-engined. This was a disadvantage for the early &quot;barndoor&quot; Panel Vans, which could not easily be loaded from the rear because the engine cover intruded on interior space, but generally advantageous in traction and interior noise. The Corvair pickup used a folding side panel that functioned as a ramp into the bed when opened, and was called the &quot;Rampside&quot;. The VW &quot;pickup&quot; in both single and double cab versions had a bed/floor that was flat from front to back at the height of the engine compartment cover, which had the advantage of a flat load floor but at a greater height, while the Corvair &quot;pickup&quot; bed/floor stepped down in front of the engine compartment to a much lower load floor which worked well with the unique &quot;Rampside&quot; configuration for loading.

Decades after production of the Type 2 ended, Volkswagen announced in 2017 that they would be bringing an electric VW microbus out based on the new MEB platform in 2022.

== Variants ==
The Type 2 was available as a:
* Panel van, a delivery van without side windows or rear seats.
* Double-door Panel Van, a delivery van without side windows or rear seats and cargo doors on both sides.
* High Roof Panel Van (), a delivery van with raised roof.
* Kombi, from (combination motor vehicle), with side windows and removable rear seats, both a passenger and a cargo vehicle combined.
* Bus, also called a &quot;Volkswagen Caravelle&quot;, a van with more comfortable interior reminiscent of passenger cars since the third generation.
* Lotação (share taxi), a version exclusive to Brazil, with 6 front-hinged doors for the passenger area and 4 bench-seats, catering to the supplemental public transport segment. Available from 1960 to 1989, in both the split-window and &quot;clipper&quot; (fitted with the bay-window front panel) bodystyles.
* Samba-Bus, a van with skylight windows and cloth sunroof, first generation only, also known as a &quot;Deluxe Microbus&quot;. They were marketed for touring the Alps.
* Flatbed pickup truck, or Single Cab, also available with wider load bed.
* Crew cab pick-up, a flatbed truck with extended cab and two rows of seats, also called a Doka, from .
* Westfalia camping van, &quot;Westy&quot;, with Westfalia roof and interior. Included optional &quot;pop up&quot; top.
* Adventurewagen camping van, with high roof and camping units from Adventurewagen.
* Semi-camping van that can also still be used as a passenger car and transporter, sacrificing some camping comforts. &quot;Multivan&quot; or &quot;Weekender&quot;, available from the third generation on.

Apart from these factory variants, there were a multitude of third-party conversions available, some of which were offered through Volkswagen dealers. They included, but were not limited to, refrigerated vans, hearses, ambulances, police vans, fire engines and ladder trucks, and camping van conversions by companies other than Westfalia. There were even 30 Klv 20 rail-going draisines built for Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1955.

In South Africa, it is known as a well-loved variation of the ice cream van (first, second and third generations).

== First generation (T1; 1950) ==


The first generation of the Volkswagen Type 2 with the split windshield, informally called the Microbus, Splitscreen, or Splittie among modern fans, was produced from 8 March 1950 through the end of the 1967 model year. From 1950 to 1956, the T1 (not called that at the time) was built in Wolfsburg; from 1956, it was built at the completely new Transporter factory in Hanover. Like the Beetle, the first Transporters used the 1100 Volkswagen air-cooled engine, a , DIN-rated , air-cooled flat-four-cylinder &#x27;boxer&#x27; engine mounted in the rear. This was upgraded to the 1200 – a in 1953. A higher compression ratio became standard in 1955; while an unusual early version of the engine debuted exclusively on the Type 2 in 1959. Any 1959 models that retain that early engine today are rare. Since the engine was discontinued almost immediately, no spare parts were made available.

The early versions of the T1 until 1955 were often called the &quot;Barndoor&quot; (retrospectively called T1a since the 1990s), owing to the enormous rear engine cover, while the later versions with a slightly modified body (the roofline above the windshield is extended), smaller engine bay, and 15&quot; roadwheels instead of the original 16&quot; ones are nowadays called the T1b (again, only called this since the 1990s, based on VW&#x27;s retrospective T1, 2, 3, 4 etc. naming system). From the 1964 model year, when the rear door was made wider (same as on the bay-window or T2), the vehicle could be referred to as the T1c. That year also saw the introduction of an optional sliding door for the passenger/cargo area instead of the outwardly hinged doors typical of cargo vans.

In 1962, a heavy-duty Transporter was introduced as a factory option. It featured a cargo capacity of instead of the previous , smaller but wider 14&quot; roadwheels, and a 1.5 L, DIN engine. This was so successful that only a year later, the 750 kg, 1.2 L Transporter was discontinued. The 1963 model year introduced the 1500 engine – as standard equipment to the US market at DIN with an bore, stroke, and 7.8:1 compression ratio. When the Beetle received the 1.5 L engine for the 1967 model year, its power was increased to DIN.

German production stopped after the 1967 model year; however, the T1 still was made in Brazil until 1975, when it was modified with a 1968–79 T2-style front end, and big 1972-vintage taillights into the so-called &quot;T1.5&quot; and produced until 1996. The Brazilian T1s were not identical to the last German models (the T1.5 was locally produced in Brazil using the 1950s and 1960s-era stamping dies to cut down on retooling, alongside the Beetle/Fusca, where the pre-1965 body style was retained), though they sported some characteristic features of the T1a, such as the cargo doors and five-stud Pitch Circle Diameter rims. Wheel tracks varied between German and Brazilian production and with 14-inch, 15-inch and 16-inch wheel variants but commonly front track varied from 1290 mm to 1310 mm and rear track from 1370 mm to 1390 mm.

Among North American enthusiasts, it is common to refer to the different models by the number of their windows. The basic Kombi or Bus is the 11-window (a.k.a. three-window bus because of three side windows) with a split windshield, two front cabin door windows, six rear side windows, and one rear window. The DeLuxe model featured eight rear side windows and two rear corner windows, making it the 15-window (not available in Europe). Meanwhile, the sunroof DeLuxe with its additional eight small skylight windows is, accordingly, the 23-window. From the 1964 model year, with its wider rear door, the rear corner windows were discontinued, making the latter two the 13-window and 21-window respectively. The 23- and later 21-window variants each carry the nickname &quot;Samba&quot; or in Australia, officially &quot;Alpine&quot;.

=== Samba ===

The Volkswagen &quot;Samba&quot;, officially the &quot;Kleinbus Sonderausführung&quot; (small bus, special version) and marketed as the Microbus Deluxe and Sunroof Deluxe in the United States, was the most luxurious version of the T1. Volkswagen started producing Sambas in 1951; in 1952 the name in the home market was changed to &quot;Sondermodell&quot; (special model). the precise origin of the Samba nickname is unclear: sources refer to &quot;samba cars&quot;, special train cars for dancing used by the Bundesbahn in the 1950s, while others suggest that it is an abbreviation for either &quot;Sonder-Ausführung mit besonderer Ausstattung&quot; (special version with special equipment) or for &quot;Sonnendach-Ausführung mit besonderem Armaturenbrett&quot; (sunroof version with special dashboard). The Samba name first appeared in official literature in Dutch price lists.

In the US Volkswagen vans were informally identified by the window count. This particular model had 23 and later 21 windows including eight high windows in the roof. The 23 window variant also had curved windows in the rear corners.

The Samba had bi-parting doors in lieu of a sliding door, and could be ordered with a large fabric sunroof. Volkswagen advertised the Samba for making tourist trips through the Alps.

Standard paint finishes on the Samba were two-tone, usually with the upper bodywork in white. The lower bodywork carried a contrasting color, the areas separated by a decorative strip. The roof carried slightly forward of the windshield at the front, creating an integral visor. The windows had chrome tables and the van had a more comprehensive dashboard than the normal T1.

When Volkswagen started producing the successor of the T1 (the T2) the company also stopped producing the Samba, ending the Samba and the concept of a van with such a high window count.

=== US Chicken tax ===

Certain models of the Volkswagen Type 2 played a role in a historic episode during the early 1960s known as the Chicken War. France and West Germany had placed tariffs on imports of US chicken. Diplomacy failed, and in January 1964, two months after taking office, President Johnson imposed a 25% tax (almost ten times the average US tariff) on potato starch, dextrin, brandy, and light trucks. Officially, the tax targeted items imported from Europe as approximating the value of lost American chicken sales to Europe.

In retrospect, audio tapes from the Johnson White House revealed a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; unrelated to chicken. In January 1964, President Johnson attempted to convince United Auto Workers&#x27; president Walter Reuther not to initiate a strike just before the 1964 election, and to support the president&#x27;s civil rights platform. Reuther, in turn, wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen&#x27;s increased shipments to the United States.

The Chicken Tax directly curtailed importation of German-built Type 2s in configurations that qualified them as light trucks – that is, commercial vans (panel vans) and pickups; vans imported in passenger configuration were not affected. In 1964, US imports of trucks from West Germany declined to a value of $5.7 million – about one-third the value imported in the previous year. After 1971, Volkswagen cargo vans and pickup trucks, the intended targets, practically disappeared from the US market. While post-1971 Type 2 commercial vans and single-cab and double-cab pickups can be found in the United States today, they are exceedingly rare. Any post-1971 specimen found ostensibly has had its import tariff paid. The &quot;Chicken tax&quot; remains in effect today, even though it is now commonly circumvented by converting passenger vehicles to utility vehicles after they have entered the United States, a form of tariff engineering. This practice is ironically exercised by Ford (for its Transit Connect van), one of the companies the tax was meant to protect.

== Second generation (T2; 1967) == 
In late 1967, the second generation of the Volkswagen Type 2 (T2) was introduced. It was built in West Germany until 1979. In Mexico, the Volkswagen Kombi and Panel were produced from 1970 to 1994. Early models are often called the T2a (or &quot;Early Bay&quot;), models after 1971 are called the T2b (or &quot;Late Bay&quot;) and models after 1991 are called the T2c.

This second-generation Type 2 lost its distinctive split front windshield, and was longer and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are &quot;Breadloaf&quot; and &quot;Bay-window&quot;, or &quot;Loaf&quot; and &quot;Bay&quot; for short. At 1.6 L and DIN, the engine was also slightly larger. The battery and electrical system was upgraded to 12 volts, making it incompatible with electric accessories from the previous generation. The new model eliminated the swing axle rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height. Instead, half-shaft axles fitted with constant velocity joints raised ride height without the wild changes in camber of the Beetle-based swing axle suspension. The updated Bus transaxle is sought by off-road racers using air-cooled Volkswagen components.

=== T2b ===
The T2b was introduced by way of gradual change over three years. The first models featured rounded bumpers incorporating a step for use when the door was open (replaced by indented bumpers without steps on later models), front doors that opened to 90° from the body, no lip on the front guards, unique engine hatches, and crescent air intakes in the D-pillars (later models after the Type 4 engine option was offered, have squared off intakes). The 1971 Type 2 featured a new, 1.6 L engine with dual intake ports on each cylinder head and was DIN-rated at . An important change came with the introduction of front disc brakes and new roadwheels with brake ventilation holes and flatter hubcaps. Up until 1972, front indicators are set low on the nose rather than high on either side of the fresh air grille – giving rise to their being nicknamed &quot;Low Lights&quot;. 1972&#x27;s most prominent change was a bigger engine compartment to fit the larger 1.7- to 2.0-litre engines from the Volkswagen Type 4, and a redesigned rear end which eliminated the removable rear apron and introduced the larger late tail lights. The air inlets were also enlarged to accommodate the increased cooling air needs of the larger engines.

In 1971 the 1600cc Type 1 engine as used in the Beetle, was supplemented with the 1700cc Type 4 engine – as it was originally designed for the Type 4 (411 and 412) models. European vans kept the option of upright fan Type 1 1600 engine but the 1700 Type 4 became standard for US spec models.


In the Type 2, the Type 4 engine, or &quot;pancake engine&quot;, was an option for the 1972 model year onward. This engine was standard in models destined for the US and Canada. Only with the Type 4 engine did an automatic transmission become available for the first time in the 1973 model year. Both engines were 1.7 L, DIN-rated at with the manual transmission and with the automatic. The Type 4 engine was enlarged to 1.8 L and DIN for the 1974 model year and again to 2.0 L and DIN for the 1976 model year. The two-litre option appeared in South African manufactured models during 1976, originally only in a comparably well-equipped &quot;Executive&quot; model. The 1978 2.0 L now featured hydraulic valve lifters, eliminating the need to periodically adjust the valve clearances as on earlier models. The 1975 and later US model years received Bosch L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection as standard equipment; 1978 was the first year for electronic ignition, utilizing a hall effect sensor and digital controller, eliminating maintenance-requiring contact-breaker points. As with all Transporter engines, the focus in development was not on power, but on low-end torque. The Type 4 engines were considerably more robust and durable than the Type 1 engines, particularly in Transporter service.

In 1972, for the 1973 model year, exterior revisions included relocated front turn indicators, squared off and set higher in the valance, above the headlights. Also, square-profiled bumpers, which became standard until the end of the T2 in 1979, were introduced in 1973. Crash safety improved with this change because of a compressible structure behind the front bumper. This meant that the T2b was capable of meeting US safety standards for passenger cars of the time, though not required of vans. The &quot;VW&quot; emblem on the front valance became slightly smaller.

Later model changes were primarily mechanical. By 1974, the T2 had gained its final shape. Very late in the T2&#x27;s design life, during the late 1970s, the first prototypes of Type 2 vans with four-wheel drive (4WD) were built and tested.

=== T2c ===


The T2c, with a roof raised by about was built starting in the early 1990s for the Mexican, South American and Central American markets. Since 1991, the T2c has been built in México with the water-cooled 1.8 L inline four-cylinder carbureted engine—easily identified by the large, black front-mounted radiator—and since 1995 with the 1.6 L air-cooled engines for the Brazilian market.

Once production of the original Beetle ended in late 2003, the T2 was the only Volkswagen model with an air-cooled, rear-mounted boxer engine, but then the Brazilian model shifted to a water-cooled engine on 23 December 2005. There was a 1.6 L water-cooled diesel engine available from 1981 to 1985, which gave fuel economy of 15 km/L to 18 km/L—but gave slow performance and its insufficient cooling system led to short engine life.

The end of the Volkswagen air-cooled engine worldwide was marked by a Special Edition Kombi. An exclusive silver paint scheme and limited edition emblems were applied to only 200 units in late 2005, and these were sold as 2006 models.

Stricter emissions regulations introduced by the Brazilian government for 2006 forced a shift to a flexible-fuel water-cooled engine able to run on petrol or alcohol. Borrowed from the Volkswagen Gol, the engine is a rear-mounted EA-111 1.4 L 8v Total Flex , on petrol, and when run on ethanol, and torque.

Production of the Brazilian Volkswagen Kombi ended in 2013 with a production run of 600 Last Edition vehicles. A short film entitled &quot;Os Últimos Desejos da Kombi&quot; (English: The Kombi&#x27;s Last Wishes) was made by Volkswagen Brazil to commemorate the end of production. Brazilian requirements that new cars have driver and passenger airbags and anti-lock brakes were also factors in the end of T2 production.

== Third generation (T3; 1979) ==

The Volkswagen Type 2 (T3), (T25 within the UK) or Vanagon in the United States, the T3 platform was introduced in 1979, and was one of the last new Volkswagen platforms to use an air-cooled engine. The Volkswagen air-cooled engine was phased out for a water-cooled boxer engine (still rear-mounted) in 1983. Compared to its predecessor the T2, the T3 was larger and heavier, with square corners replacing the rounded edges of the older models. The T3 is sometimes called &quot;the wedge&quot; by enthusiasts to differentiate it from earlier Kombis.

== Fourth generation (T4; 1990) ==

For 1990, the T4 generation was released, with the model range dropping the Type 2 name in favor of the Transporter nameplate. Over 15 years after the Golf was introduced as the replacement for the Type 1 (Beetle), the Transporter range also adopted a front-engine, front-wheel drive configuration (Syncro 4WD returned as an option). Worldwide, the model range now used water-cooled, fuel-injected engines, with inline (and later VR6) engines replacing the &quot;wasserboxer&quot;.

Through much of the world, the T4 was marketed as the Transporter, with 3-row passenger vans known as the Caravelle; the Vanagon name was used in Japan. In the United States, the T4 was marketed as the Eurovan mid-size van for 1993 and from 1999 to 2003; from 1995 to 2005, the Eurovan served as the basis for multiple recreational vehicles marketed through the United States and Canada. Sales of the Transporter in North America ended in 2003.

== Fifth generation (T5; 2003) ==

The Volkswagen Transporter T5 range is the fifth generation of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles medium-sized light commercial vehicle and people movers. Launched 6 January 2003, the T5 went into full production in April 2003, replacing the fourth generation range.

Key markets for the T5 are Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and Turkey. It is not sold in the US market because it is classed as a light truck, accruing the 25% chicken tax on importation. The T5 has a more aerodynamic design. The angle of the windshield and A-pillar is less; this makes for a large dashboard and small bonnet.

In June 2009, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles announced the one-millionth T5 rolled off the production line in Hanover.

T5 GP introduced in 2010. Heavily facelifted with some new power plants including the 180 bi-turbo range topper. These new engines saw the demise of the now &quot;dirty&quot; 5 cylinder units.

Late 2015 will see the arrival of the &quot;Neu Sechs&quot;, the New 6. The T6 will offer further engine changes in early 2016, but will launch with the previous generation engines. The new engines will see the introduction of Ad-Blu to meet with euro 6 emission compliance. The new 6 was expected by many to be more than just a facelift.

== Sixth generation (T6; 2015) ==

The new T6 launched with the old Euro 5 non-AdBlue power-plants, but is offered with a Euro 6 diesel engine with 204bhp and AdBlue. Three further Euro 6 Adblue diesel power-plants with 84ps, 102ps and 150ps are also offered.

There is some debate in the community over whether the T6 is a new model, or simply a face-lift of the T5. There are obvious external changes to the nose and tailgate, while internally there is a new dash in two different versions. Volkswagen claims refinement to ride, handling and noise levels.

== Volkswagen Microbus concept vehicle ==
In 2001, a Volkswagen Microbus concept was created, with design cues from the T1 generation in a spirit similar to the New Beetle nostalgia movement. Volkswagen planned to start selling it in the United States market in 2007, but it was scrapped in May 2004 and replaced with a more cost-effective design to be sold worldwide.

== Names and nicknames ==
Like the Beetle, from the beginning, the Type 2 earned many nicknames from its fans. Popular nicknames in German include &quot;VW-Bus&quot;, &quot;Bulli/Bully&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Bus&quot; and &quot;Lieferwagen&quot; (delivery van)), &quot;Hippie-van&quot;, or simply &quot;der Bus&quot;. The Type 2 was meant to be officially named the Bully, but Heinrich Lanz, producer of the Lanz Bulldog farm tractor, intervened. The model was then presented as the Volkswagen Transporter and Volkswagen Kleinbus, but the Bully nickname still caught on.

The official German-language model names Transporter and Kombi (&quot;Kombinationskraftwagen&quot;, combined-use vehicle) have also caught on as nicknames. Kombi is not only the name of the passenger variant but also the Australasian and Brazilian term for the whole Type 2 family, in much the same way that they are all called VW-Bus in Germany, even the pickup truck variations. In Mexico, the German Kombi was translated as Combi and became a household word thanks to the vehicle&#x27;s popularity in Mexico City&#x27;s public transportation system. In Peru, where the term &quot;Combi&quot; was similarly adopted, the term &quot;Combi Asesina&quot; (Murderous Combi) is often used for buses of similar size, because of the notorious recklessness and competition of bus drivers in Lima to get passengers. In Portugal it is known as &quot;Pão-de-Forma&quot; (Breadloaf) because its design resembles a bread baked in a mold. Similarly, in Denmark, the Type 2 is referred to as &quot;Rugbrød&quot; (Rye bread). Finns dubbed it &quot;Kleinbus&quot; (mini-bus), as many taxicab companies adopted it for group transportation; the name Kleinbus has become an appellative for all passenger vans. The vehicle is also known as Kleinbus in Chile.

In the US, however, it is a VW bus, minibus, hippie-mobile, hippie bus, hippie van, &quot;combie&quot;, Microbus, or Transporter to aficionados. The early versions produced before 1967 used a split front windshield (giving rise to the nickname &quot;Splitty&quot;), and their comparative rarity has led to their becoming sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. The next version, sold in the US market from 1968 to 1979, is characterised by a large, curved windshield and is commonly called a &quot;bay-window&quot;. It was replaced by the Vanagon, of which only the Westfalia camper version has a common nickname, &quot;Westy&quot;.

A popular nickname for the T3 was &quot;2.6i&quot; or &quot;transi&quot; in reference to the 2.6 liter Microbus/Caravelle sold in South Africa and their robust design being a popular choice for transportation of children respectively. Kombi is also a generic nickname for vans and minibuses in South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, often used as a means of public transportation. In Nigeria it is called Danfo.

In the UK, it is known as a &quot;Campervan&quot;. In France, it was called a &quot;camping-car&quot; (usually hyphenated) though this has been expanded to include other, often more specialized vehicles in more recent times.

Among VW enthusiasts in countries of the former Yugoslavia, especially in Serbia and Croatia, VW T2 bus is commonly called a &quot;Terrorist&quot;, probably due to its cameo appearance in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film in which it is driven by a group of Libyan terrorists.

== Mexican production ==
T2 production began in 1970 at the Puebla assembly factory.

Offered initially only as a nine-passenger version called the Volkswagen Combi (Kombi in Brazil), and from 1973 also its cargo van version called the &quot;Volkswagen Panel&quot;, both variants were fitted with the 1.5 L air-cooled boxer engine and four-speed manual gearbox. In 1974, the 1.6 L boxer engine replaced the 1.5 previous one, and production continued this way up to 1987. In 1987, the water-cooled 1.8 L inline four-cylinder engine replaced the air-cooled 1.6 L. This new model is recognisable by its black grille (for its engine coolant radiator), bumpers and moldings.

In 1975, Volkswagen de México ordered two specially made pickups from Germany, one single cab and one double cab, for the Puebla plant. These were evaluated for the possibility of building pickups in Mexico, and were outfitted with every option except the Arctic package, including front and rear fog lights, intermittent wipers, trip odometer, clock, bumper rubber, PVC tilt, and dual doors on the single cab storage compartment. VW de Mexico was interested in having the lights, wiring, brake systems and other parts manufactured in Mexico. Ultimately, VW de Mexico declined to produce pickups, and the pickups were sold to an Autohaus, a Volkswagen dealer in San Antonio, Texas, since they could not be sold in Mexico. By law, no German-made Volkswagens were to be sold in Mexico. These were probably the only pickups that were produced in Germany for Mexican import, and have the &quot;ME&quot; export code on the M-code plate. The green double cab was sold to a new owner in New York, and has been lost track of. The light gray (L345, licht grau) single cab still exists. Pickups were not manufactured in Mexico, nor were they imported into Mexico from Germany, save for these two examples.

In 1988, a luxury variant – the Volkswagen Caravelle – made its debut in the Mexican market to compete with the Nissan Ichi Van, which was available in cargo, passenger and luxury versions.

The main differences between the two are that the Caravelle was sold as an eight-passenger version, while the Combi was available as a nine-passenger version, the Caravelle was only painted in metallic colors, while the Combi was only available in non-metallic colors, and the Caravelle was fitted with an AM/FM stereo cassette sound system, tinted windows, velour upholstery, reading lights, mid and rear headrests, and wheel covers from the European T3 model.

In 1991, the higher roof made its debut in all variants, and the Combi began to be offered in eight- or nine-passenger variants. In 1991, since Mexican anti-pollution regulations required a three-way catalytic converter, a Digifant fuel injection system replaced the previous carburetor. The three variants continued without change until 1994.

In 1994, production ended in Mexico, with models being imported from Brazil. The Caravelle was discontinued, and both the Combi and the Panel were only offered in white color and finally in 2002, replaced by the T4 EuroVan Pasajeros and EuroVan Carga, passenger and cargo van in long wheelbase version, inline five-cylinder 2.5 L 115 bhp and five-speed manual gearbox imported from Germany.

== Hippie van ==

The VW Type 2 became popular with the counterculture of the 1960s, thanks to its ability to transport a large group of people while being cheap and easy to maintain. Its design was simple yet spacious, thanks largely to the rear-mounted engine. It contrasted with the large sedans and station wagons that were normal at the time, giving the van an alternative and rebellious image. Vans were often painted with extravagant designs in bright colors, making them stand out on the road even more. The &quot;hippie van&quot; remains iconic today, thanks to being featured on the cover of albums by musicians such as Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys, and being used by fans of the Grateful Dead while following the band on tour. But most iconic of all, the music festival Woodstock, which was held in the summer of 1969, saw plenty of brightly painted vans transporting excited young crowds.

<text>Walter Iooss Jr. ( ; born September 15, 1943) is an American photographer noted for his images of athletes, including Michael Jordan, Kelly Slater, Tiger Woods, Scottie Pippen, and Muhammad Ali. He has been called &quot;the poet laureate of sports.&quot;

Iooss began his career shooting for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and contributed to the magazine for more than 50 years. He also photographed for the magazine&#x27;s Swimsuit Issue for 40 years. Bruce Silverstein Gallery exclusively represents Iooss&#x27; fine art photography.

==Birth and early life==

Born in Temple, Texas, Walter Iooss moved at the age of five from Temple to East Orange, New Jersey. In 1959, at the age of 16, he shot his first roll of film at nice
 City during the summer. One year later, at the age of 17 years, Walter got his first assignment from Sports Illustrated—-the same year he graduated from East Orange High School. Two years later he shot his first cover for Sports Illustrated, but five more years would bring about a change of pace for Walter. Contrary to the sports images that he had been shooting, he then became an in-house photographer for Atlantic Records. In 2004 he was awarded with the LUCIE Lifetime Achievement Award for Sports Photography.

==Career 1968–==
From 1968 through 1972, Iooss was an in-house photographer for Atlantic Records in New York, where his subjects included performers like James Brown, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.

In 1982, Iooss was recruited by Fujifilm to work on an extended study of athletes who were working their way to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The two-and-a-half-year project required him to leave his position on the staff of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (though he continued to contribute) and resulted in the publication of the book &quot;Shooting for the Gold&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Iooss was commissioned to photograph advertising campaigns for Camel cigarettes.

In 1993, Iooss&#x27; work was featured on 27 baseball cards in an Upper Deck set dubbed &quot;The Iooss Collection.&quot;

Though he has worked with athletes and models, Iooss has also photographed Cuban children playing ball in the street and captured the raw desire of Thai kickboxers. According to Iooss, &quot;The real joy of photography is these moments. I&#x27;m always looking for freedom, the search for the one-on-one. That&#x27;s when your instincts come out.&quot;

== Exhibitions ==

== Awards and nominations ==
* 2004: Lucie award for Outstanding Achievement in Sports Photography.

== Personal ==
Iooss is married to Eva Iooss, with whom he has two sons, Christian and Bjorn.

<doc id="552037" wikidata="Q486379" url="?curid=552037" title="Gosu">
<text>Gosu () is a Korean term used to refer to a highly skilled person. In computer gaming the term is usually used to refer to a person who dominated games like &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, &quot;Diablo II&quot;, &quot;DotA&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;, &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;Overwatch 2&quot;, &quot;Apex Legends&quot; and others. The term was adopted by gaming communities in many countries because of a large South Korean presence in online gaming communities.

== Origin ==

The term is Sino-Korean vocabulary, and cognates in other East Asian languages that feature the same hanja (, literally &quot;high hand&quot;) include &quot;gāoshǒu&quot; (Mandarin, &quot;expert; ace; master&quot;), and &quot;cao thủ&quot; (Vietnamese, &quot;skilled person; master&quot;). In the dialect of the Gyeongnam province, &quot;gosu&quot; also has the meaning of &quot;leader&quot;. Figuratively meaning pro or highly skilled at something, &quot;gosu&#x27;s&quot; pre-computing usage usually referred to martial arts or the game of go.

== Related terms ==

Though not as popular, there are also several other commonly used Korean words for describing gamers with various skill levels. &quot;Jungsu&quot; () stands for &quot;a moderately good player&quot;, &quot;hasu&quot; () for &quot;a poor player&quot; or &quot;a person with no skill&quot; and &quot;chobo&quot; () for &quot;a novice player&quot;. Hasu and chobo are the same skill level, but hasu is disrespectful or derogatory (whereas chobo is not). The English equivalent to hasu would be &quot;noob&quot; or &quot;scrub&quot; and chobo would be &quot;beginner&quot; or &quot;newbie&quot;.

== Synonyms ==
*leet or 1337
*Über
*Pro
*Master

<text>The Vietnam Veterans is a French psychedelic band, hailing originally from Chalon-sur-Saône, a commune in eastern France. They released six full-length albums during the 1980s, starting in 1983. The band was praised by many alternative music publications, including &quot;Bucketfull of Brains&quot; during the 1980s. After a 21-year-long pause, they are now active again.

==History==
After releasing their compilation album &quot;The Days of Pearly Spencer&quot; in 1988, they broke up, and some members moved on to other projects. In 2005 The Vietnam Veterans released a single called &quot;I Give You My Life / Children Eyes&quot;, and in 2009 a full-length album called &quot;Strange Girl (As The Gitanes)&quot;. The band The Gitanes was one of the projects a few of the former Vets had, and the name is now added to The Vietnam Veterans name, calling it &quot;The Vietnam Veterans (a.k.a. The Gitanes)&quot;. Mark Enbatta died 9. 9. 2021.

<text>Toy Love were a New Zealand new wave and punk rock band that originated in Dunedin and was active from 1978 to 1980. Members included Chris Knox, Alec Bathgate and Paul Kean.

==History==
Chris Knox was the band&#x27;s front man and other members were guitarist Alec Bathgate, bass player Paul Kean, drummer Mike Dooley, and keyboard player Jane Walker. The band developed out of the earlier punk band The Enemy from Dunedin, and are often regarded as the progenitors of the Dunedin sound movement. Toy Love were together for less than two years (1978–80) and spent a large part of that time in Australia.

They released just one, self-titled album. The band members were apparently appalled by the mixing of the tracks, which took the edge off the band&#x27;s deliberately raw sound. In April 2005, the album was remastered and released along with a number of demos and unreleased tracks as a double CD entitled &quot;Cuts&quot;. In 2012, a further compilation, simply titled &quot;Toy Love&quot;, was released on double LP, containing all singles, b-sides, compilation tracks, demos and some live recordings (this has the same front cover artwork as &quot;Cuts&quot;).

After Toy Love broke up, Bathgate and Knox remained together as the Tall Dwarfs. Kean was later a member of The Bats.

In 2012, Toy Love was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame and given the Legacy Award at the Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards.

Jane Walker died in October 2018; her death was announced by Flying Nun Records on Twitter.

<text>The United States Air Force officer rank insignia in use today.

==Current insignia==
United States Air Force officer rank insignia. The ranks are divided into three sections: company grade, field grade, and general officers. Company grade officers are those officers of grades O-1 to O-3. Field grade officers are those of grades O-4 to O-6. General officers are those of O-7 and above.

Currently, promotion from Second Lieutenant to First Lieutenant is virtually guaranteed after two years of satisfactory service. Promotion to Captain is virtually guaranteed after another two years of satisfactory service. Previously there was a Promotion Board to Captain, but that was discontinued in 2013. An officer&#x27;s record is reviewed by a selection board at the Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. This process occurs approximately between the nine- and eleven-year mark, where a certain percentage of Captains will be selected for Major. This process will repeat at the 13-16 year mark for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel and then around the twenty-year mark for promotion to Colonel.

The five-star grade General of the Air Force has only been held by General of the Air Force Henry H. Arnold. Federal law currently contains no provisions to promote an officer to five-star grade.

==Wearing of insignia==
On the Air Force Mess Dress uniform, officer rank insignia are embroidered in silver or gold thread on detachable shoulder boards which are attached to the mess dress jacket. No rank insignia are worn on the mess dress shirt.

On the service dress uniform, metal rank insignia pins are worn on the epaulets of the Air Force Blue service dress jacket. Rank insignia are also worn on epaulets which slide onto the epaulet loops on the light blue shirt; the rank insignia is embroidered in silver or gold thread on an Air Force blue field. The slide-on epaulet for field-grade officers&#x27; shirts has a single line of silver piping toward the outer edge of the epaulet. The slide-on epaulet for general officers&#x27; shirts has silver piping on both the inner and outer edges of the epaulets. These slide-on epaulets are also worn on the cardigan and pull-over uniform sweaters. Unlike the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, metal rank insignia for general officers consists of separate rather than conjoined stars.

The Flight Duty Uniform (FDU) features subdued cloth rank insignia sewn onto the shoulders. The Air Force flight cap is worn with the FDU and service dress uniforms (the service cap may also be worn with the service uniform). The flight cap is solid Air Force Blue for enlisted personnel, but features a solid silver edge braid for general officers, and an edge braid in a silver and blue diamond pattern for other officers. Officers wear a bright metal rank insignia toward the front edge of the (wearer&#x27;s) left side of the flight cap.

On the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) uniform rank is worn as a velcro patch on the center of the chest. Subdued cloth rank is worn on the front of the OCP patrol cap, above the bill. Air Force officers authorized to wear berets (Security Forces Officers, Special Tactics Officers, Combat Rescue Officers, and Combat Weather Officers) wear a bright metal rank insignia on the beret&#x27;s flash.

Subdued rank insignia, as worn on the OCP and FDU, are designed to reduce visibility of the wearer under field conditions. The subdued versions of silver insignia are embroidered in dark blue thread on an olive-drab backing. The subdued versions of gold insignia are embroidered in brown thread on an olive-drab backing. On Desert FDUs and OCP uniforms, OCP patterned backing (or tan for the FDU) replaces the olive-drab backing (with black thread in place of dark blue thread). Subdued metal insignia are black and brown in place of silver and gold, respectively. General officers wear black stars as subdued rank.

Agents of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations normally do not wear uniforms while on duty, but even when in uniform they often do not wear rank insignia. However, when attending Professional Military Education courses, they do wear rank insignia.

==Past insignia for the McPeak Uniform==
The current Air Force officer rank names and insignia were taken from the Army upon the establishment of the Air Force as a separate service in 1947. The insignia have been essentially unchanged since then, except for a brief period during the 1990s, when then-Air Force Chief of Staff General Merrill A. McPeak redesigned the service dress uniform. 

His redesign replaced the metal rank insignia for officers with silver braid on the sleeves, similar to the officer rank insignia now used by the US Navy and Coast Guard. This was similar to the rank insignia of the British Royal Air Force, the Canadian Armed Forces and other Commonwealth air forces. The &quot;McPeak uniform&quot; was very unpopular, drawing comparisons to the jackets worn by airline pilots, and the traditional shoulder rank insignia were reinstated to the service coat within a week of General McPeak&#x27;s retirement in 1994.

==Civil Air Patrol==
Senior members are members who joined CAP for the first time past the age of 18, or who are former cadets who transferred to the senior member program, which must happen by the cadet&#x27;s 21st birthday. Senior members who have not yet turned 21 years are eligible for flight officer grades, which include flight officer, technical flight officer, and senior flight officer. There is no mandatory retirement age for CAP members, and there are no physical requirements for joining. Members may enter retired status after twenty years of service. The only physical requirements senior members must follow are the weight and grooming standards required in order to wear the United States Air Force-style uniforms. Senior members who do not meet the weight and grooming standards of the United States Air Force may wear alternative uniforms known as CAP Corporate uniforms.

Officer grades up to lieutenant colonel reflect progression in training and organizational seniority, rather than command authority. Because of this, it is not uncommon for senior members commanding groups and squadrons to have members of superior grades serving under them. Current, retired and former members of the United States Armed Forces may be promoted directly to the CAP grade equivalent to their military grade up to lieutenant colonel, although some choose to follow the same standards as non-prior-service members. Except for a few exceptional cases, senior members are only promoted to the grade of CAP colonel upon appointment as a Region Commander, responsible for overseeing multiple states, or Wing Commander, responsible for the administration of CAP units across an entire state.

<text>Reaper Man is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. Published in 1991, it is the 11th &quot;Discworld&quot; novel and the second to focus on Death. The title is a reference to Alex Cox&#x27;s movie &quot;Repo Man&quot;.

==Plot==

The Auditors of Reality watch the Discworld to ensure everything obeys The Rules. As Death starts developing a personality the Auditors feel that he does not perform his Duty in the right way. They send him to live like everyone else. Travelling to the Octarine Grass Country, he assumes the name &quot;Bill Door&quot; and he works as a farm hand for the elderly Miss Flitworth. She is a spinster whose fiancé, Rufus, died on a last smuggling expedition many years ago. There are rumours that he had had second thoughts about their marriage but she does not believe them.

While every other species creates a new Death for themselves, humans need more time for their Death to be completed. As a result, the life force of dead humans starts to build up; this results in poltergeist activity, ghosts, and other paranormal phenomena. Most notable is the return of the recently deceased wizard Windle Poons, who was really looking forward to reincarnation. After several misadventures, including being accosted by his oldest friends, he finds himself attending the Fresh Start club, an undead-rights group led by Reg Shoe. The Fresh Start club and the wizards of Unseen University discover that the city of Ankh-Morpork is being invaded by a parasitic lifeform that feeds on cities and hatches from eggs that resemble snow globes. Tracking its middle form, shopping trolleys, the Fresh Start club and the wizards invade and destroy the third form, a shopping mall.

When humankind finally thinks of a New Death, one with a crown and without any humanity or human face, it comes to take Bill Door. Death/Door, having planned for this moment for some time, outwits and destroys it. Having defeated the New Death, Death absorbs the other Deaths back into him, with the exception of the Death of Rats (and ultimately, the Death of Fleas). Death confronts Azrael, the Death of the Universe, and states that the Deaths have to care or they do not exist and there is nothing but Oblivion, which must also end some time.

Death asks for and receives some time. He meets up with Miss Flitworth again and offers her unlimited dreams. She asks to go to the local Harvest Dance. They prepare and join the townspeople for a full night of dancing.

As the sun is coming up, Miss Flitworth realizes she had died hours before the dance even started. Death escorts her through back history to her old fiancé: as she had believed, he had died in an accident and not been unfaithful. The young couple enter the afterlife together.

Returning to the city of Ankh-Morpork, Death meets up with Windle Poons, finally taking him to his afterlife. At the end there is also a discussion between Death and the Death of Rats over what the Death of Rats should &quot;ride&quot;, Death suggests a dog while the Death of Rats suggests a cat.

<doc id="552107" wikidata="Q2595956" url="?curid=552107" title="Psychic surgery">
<text>Psychic surgery is a pseudoscientific medical fraud in which practitioners create the illusion of performing surgery with their bare hands and use sleight of hand, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the patient that diseased lesions have been removed and that the incision has spontaneously healed.

The US Federal Trade Commission describes psychic surgery as a &quot;total hoax&quot;. Psychic surgery may cause needless death by keeping the ill away from life-saving medical care. Medical professionals and skeptics classify it as sleight of hand and any positive results as a placebo effect.

Psychic surgery first appeared in the spiritualist communities of the Philippines and Brazil in the middle of the 20th century; it has taken different paths in those two countries.

==Procedure==
Although psychic surgery varies by region and practitioner, it usually follows some common lines. Without the use of a surgical instrument, a practitioner will press the tips of their fingers against the patient&#x27;s skin in the area to be treated. The practitioner&#x27;s hands appear to penetrate into the patient&#x27;s body painlessly and blood seems to flow. The practitioner will then show organic matter or foreign objects apparently removed from the patient&#x27;s body, clean the area, and then end the procedure with the patient&#x27;s skin showing no wounds or scars.

Most cases do not involve actual surgery although some practitioners make real incisions. In regions of the world where belief in evil spirits is prevalent, practitioners will sometimes exhibit objects, such as glass, saying that the foreign bodies were placed in the patient&#x27;s body by evil spirits.

==History==
Accounts of psychic surgery started to appear in the spiritualist communities of the Philippines and Brazil in the mid-1900s. The 16th-century explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca records an account, related to him by Native Americans, of a bearded figure known as &quot;Mala Cosa&quot; (Evil Thing), who would take hold of a person, cut into their abdomen with a flint knife, and remove a portion of their entrails, which he would then burn in a fire. When he was done the incision would close spontaneously.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the procedure was first noticed in the 1940s, when performed routinely by Eleuterio Terte. Terte and his pupil Tony Agpaoa, who was apparently associated with the &quot;Union Espiritista Christiana de Filipinas&quot; (The Christian Spiritist Union of the Philippines), trained others in this procedure.

In 1959, the procedure came to the attention of the U.S. public after the publication of &quot;Into the Strange Unknown&quot; by Ron Ormond and Ormond McGill. The authors called the practice &quot;fourth dimensional surgery&quot;, and wrote &quot;[we] still don’t know what to think; but we have motion pictures to show it wasn’t the work of any normal magician, and could very well be just what the Filipinos said it was — a miracle of God performed by a fourth dimensional surgeon.&quot;

In &quot;...1973, a group of medical doctors, scientists, and parapsychologists visited the Philippine Islands to study a phenomenon that was causing increased furor amongst health professionals ... Filipino psychic surgeons, also known as spiritual/magnetic healers.&quot;

Alex Orbito, who became well known in the United States through his association with actress Shirley MacLaine was a practitioner of the procedure. On June 14, 2005, Orbito was arrested by Canadian authorities and indicted for fraud. On January 20, 2006, the charges were dropped as it then seemed unlikely that Orbito would be convicted.

Psychic surgery made U.S. tabloid headlines in March 1984 when entertainer Andy Kaufman, diagnosed with large cell carcinoma (a rare lung cancer), traveled to the Philippines for a six-week course of psychic surgery. Practitioner Jun Labo claimed to have removed large cancerous tumors and Kaufman declared he believed this cancer had been removed. Kaufman died from renal failure as consequence of a metastatic lung cancer, on May 16, 1984.

===Brazil===
The origins of the practice in Brazil are obscure, but by the late 1950s &quot;spiritual healers&quot; were practicing in the country. Many of them were associated with Kardecist spiritism, a major spiritualistic movement in Brazil, and claimed to be performing their operations merely as channels for spirits of deceased medical doctors.

A known Brazilian psychic healer who routinely practiced psychic surgery was Zé Arigó, who claimed to be channeling a (fictional) medical doctor named Dr. Fritz. Unlike most other psychic healers, who work bare-handed, Arigó used a non-surgical blade. Other psychic healers who claimed to channel Dr. Fritz were Edson Queiroz and Rubens Farias Jr. Later, one João de Faria, also known as João de Deus, became popular while he operated in Abadiânia, state of Goiás. Faria has since been arrested and found guilty of the rapes of several women. Dozens of similar accusations are awaiting trial.

According to the descriptions of Yoshiaki Omura, Brazilian psychic surgery appears to be different from that practiced in the Philippines. Omura calls attention to the fact that practitioners in Brazil use techniques resembling qigong, shiatsu massage, and chiropractic manipulation. Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed. While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds were performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.

===North America===

In the 1970s a specific form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. Willard Fuller was the most well known proponent. It was alleged that Fuller could cause dental fillings to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden fillings, straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, magicians and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings turned out to be tobacco stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted she had forgotten that the filling was already there.

==Medical and legal criticism==
In 1975, the Federal Trade Commission declared that &quot;&#x27;psychic surgery&#x27; is nothing but a total hoax&quot;. Judge Daniel H. Hanscom, when granting the FTC an injunction against travel agencies promoting psychic surgery tours, declared: &quot;Psychic surgery is pure and unmitigated fakery. The &#x27;surgical operations&#x27; of psychic surgeons ... with their bare hands are simply phony.&quot;

In 1975 the FTC stated:

It has been found that &quot;psychic surgery&quot; is pure fakery. The body is not opened, no &quot;surgery&quot; is performed with the bare hands or with anything else, and nothing is removed from the body. The entire &quot;operation&quot; is an egregious fraud perpetrated by sleight-of-hand and similar tricks and devices.

In 1990, the American Cancer Society stated that it &quot;found no evidence that &#x27;psychic surgery&#x27; results in objective benefit in the treatment of any medical condition,&quot; and strongly urged individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgery.

The British Columbia Cancer Agency &quot;strongly urges individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgeon&quot;.

While not directly hazardous to the patient, the belief in the alleged benefits of psychic surgery may carry considerable risk for individuals with diagnosed medical conditions, as they may delay or forgo conventional medical help, sometimes with fatal consequences.

==Accusations of fraud==
The physician William Nolen investigated psychic surgery and his book &quot;Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle&quot; (1974) uncovered many cases of fraud. Tony Agpaoa, a famous psychic surgeon, was detected several times using trickery. Stage magician James Randi said psychic surgery is a sleight of hand confidence trick. He said that in personal observations of the procedure, and in movies showing the procedures, he could spot sleight-of-hand moves that are evident to experienced stage magicians, but might deceive a casual observer. Randi replicated the appearance of psychic surgery himself through the use of sleight-of-hand. Professional magician Milbourne Christopher also investigated psychic surgeons at work, and observed sleight of hand. On his A&amp;E show &quot;Mindfreak&quot; in the episode &quot;Sucker&quot;, illusionist Criss Angel performed &quot;Psychic Surgery&quot;, showing first-hand how it may be done (fake blood, plastic bags and chicken livers were used).

Randi said the healer would slightly roll or pinch the skin over the area to be treated. When his flattened hand reaches under the roll of skin, it looks and feels as if the practitioner is actually entering into the patient&#x27;s body. The healer would have prepared in advance small pellets or bags of animal entrails which would be palmed in his hand or hidden beneath the table within easy reach. This organic matter would simulate the &quot;diseased&quot; tissue that the healer would claim to be removing. If the healer wants to simulate bleeding, he might squeeze a bladder of animal blood or an impregnated sponge. If done properly, this procedure may deceive patients and observers. However, some &quot;psychic surgery&quot; procedures do not rely solely on the &quot;sleight of hand&quot; described, as at least one Brazilian &quot;surgeon&quot; also cuts his victims&#x27; skin with an unsterilized scalpel to heighten the illusion.

John Taylor has written there is no real case for psychic surgery as the explanation of fraud is highly likely in all the operations. The practitioners use sleight of hand techniques to produce blood or blood-like fluids, animal tissue or substitutes, and/or various foreign objects from folds of skin of the patient as part of a confidence trick for financial benefit.

Science writer Terence Hines has written:

The &quot;operation&quot; starts as the hand appears to enter the patient’s belly. This is accomplished by creating an impression in the belly by pushing down and flexing the fingers slowly into a fist—the fingers thus appear to be moving into the belly, but are really simply hidden behind the hand. The blood that further disguises the true movement of the fingers and adds drama to the proceedings can come from two sources. One is a fake thumb, worn over the real thumb and filled with a red liquid. Such a fake thumb is a common magician’s implement. Blood can also be passed to the surgeon in red balloons hidden in cotton the psychic surgeon is using, the cotton and its hidden contents being passed to him by an &quot;assistant&quot;. The bits of &quot;tumor&quot; can also be passed to the psychic surgeon this way, or hidden in the false thumb... the &quot;tumor&quot; material turns out to be chicken intestines or similar animal remains. The blood is either animal blood or red dye.

Two &quot;psychic surgeons&quot; provided testimony in a Federal Trade Commission trial that, to their knowledge, the organic matter supposedly removed from the patients usually consists of animal tissue and clotted blood.

==In popular culture==

*In the 1989 film &quot;Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed&quot;, comedic magicians Penn and Teller demonstrate how to perform the illusion of psychic surgery.
*A 1989 episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; featured a police officer whose mother claimed to have been cured by psychic surgery, only to die shortly thereafter; her autopsy revealed several tumors. The policeman described himself going undercover to feign illness and pretended to desire psychic surgery, having the feeling of the practitioner using sleight of hand to supposedly dig into his tissue, as well as suspecting that the &quot;cysts&quot; and &quot;tumors&quot; being removed from his body were actually ready-made chicken parts.
*&quot;Milagro&quot;, a sixth-season episode from &quot;The X-Files&quot;, features a killer accused of using psychic surgery on his victims, killing them in the process.
*In the BBC TV series &quot;Full Circle with Michael Palin&quot;, Michael Palin witnesses two separate instances of psychic surgery in the Baguio district of the Philippines. On raising his suspicion with the medic that it seemed a sleight of hand to him, the medic told him he was a westerner and could only understand the surgery if he had a third eye. Palin assists another medic in a surgery and was told that no contamination happens in this procedure because of the use of garlic.

*In the 1998 Christmas Special of the BBC1 series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, entitled &quot;Black Canary&quot;, the husband of the illusionist known as Black Canary undergoes psychic surgery at the start of the episode and this form of surgery forms a plot device throughout the special.
*In the 1999 movie &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, based on the life of Andy Kaufman, Kaufman (Jim Carrey) receives psychic surgery and notices the &quot;sleight of hand,&quot; laughing at the irony. He is next seen dead, with his funeral being conducted.

<doc id="552122" wikidata="Q5149209" url="?curid=552122" title="Colour banding">
<text>Colour banding is a subtle form of posterization in digital images, caused by the colour of each pixel being rounded to the nearest of the digital colour levels. While posterization is often done for artistic effect, colour banding is an undesired artifact. In 24-bit colour modes, 8 bits per channel is usually considered sufficient to render images in Rec. 709 or sRGB. However the eye can see the difference between the colour levels, especially when there is a sharp border between two large areas of adjacent colour levels. This will happen with gradual gradients (like sunsets, dawns or clear blue skies), and also when blurring an image a large amount. 

Colour banding is more noticeable with fewer bits per pixel (BPP) at 16–256 colours (4–8 BPP), where there are fewer shades with a larger difference between them.

Possible solutions include the introduction of dithering and increasing the number of bits per colour channel.

Because the banding comes from limitations in the presentation of the image, blurring the image does &quot;not&quot; fix this.

<text>Men at Arms is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 15th book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series, first published in 1993. It is the second novel about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch on the Discworld. Lance-constable Angua von Überwald, later in the series promoted to the rank of Sergeant, is introduced in this book. Lance-constable (in the course of the novel promoted to Acting-constable) Detritus is introduced as a new member of the watch as well, though he had already appeared in other Discworld novels, most notably in &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;. Also notable is the only appearance of Lance-constable Cuddy (also promoted to Acting-constable).

==Plot==

Edward d&#x27;Eath, an Assassin and son of a down-and-out noble family, becomes convinced that the restoration of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy will solve the social change in the city which he blames for his family&#x27;s humbling. He researches the history of the royal family and determines that Carrot Ironfoundersson is in fact the rightful heir to the throne.

Meanwhile, Captain Samuel Vimes, captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, prepares for his imminent wedding to Sybil Ramkin, the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork. He also must deal with a new group of recruits that he has been required to take on for the sake of diversity: Cuddy (a dwarf), Detritus (a troll), and Angua (a werewolf—but Carrot is unaware of this, and believes she is included because she is female). When a string of seemingly random murders occur among the Guilds of the city, Lord Vetinari forbids Vimes to investigate in a successful ploy to ensure Vimes does investigate. Cuddy and Detritus are forced to work together, resulting in them becoming friends as they overcome their deep-seated racial enmity. Angua works with the talking dog Gaspode, and also forms a romantic connection with Carrot, who loses his virginity to her but handles the discovery that she is a werewolf poorly.

It is revealed that d&#x27;Eath has stolen the gonne, the Disc&#x27;s first and only handheld firearm, from the Assassins&#x27; Guild, with the intention of discrediting Vetinari&#x27;s government through the murders. Any possessor of the gonne seems to become obsessed with the device. After d&#x27;Eath reveals his plan to Dr. Cruces, head of the Assassin&#x27;s Guild, Cruces murders him and takes up the plan himself. The Watch prevent Cruces from killing Vetinari, but Cuddy and Angua are killed in the process. Vimes and Carrot confront and disarm Cruces, and Carrot helps Vimes resist the gonne&#x27;s allure. Cruces gives Carrot the evidence that he is the royal heir, upon which Carrot kills Cruces with his sword and has both the evidence and the dismantled gonne buried with Cuddy. As a werewolf can only be killed with a silver weapon, Angua is revived upon the moon&#x27;s rising.

Vimes and Ramkin are married. Recent events have raised the Night Watch&#x27;s profile, bringing a slew of new recruits. Carrot visits Vetinari, who is expecting Carrot to make personal demands as he is now in a strong position to blackmail the Patrician. What Carrot actually brings is a request for Vetinari to implement a plan for reforming the City Watch into an effective, integrated, comprehensive police force with better working conditions. Vetinari accedes, making Carrot Captain of the Watch and elevating Vimes to the recreated position Commander of the Watch, and the rank of Knight.

==Reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; considered it to not be &quot;as consistently funny as [Pratchett&#x27;s] earlier novels&quot;, but noted that &quot;the dialogue is hilarious&quot;, and opined that although it lacked &quot;rational narrative cause-and-effect&quot;, this &quot;didn&#x27;t matter&quot;; similarly, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found it to be &quot;an about average installment&quot; of an &quot;always entertaining, sometimes hysterically funny series.&quot;

Brandon Sanderson has described it as &quot;funny in a clever, scholarly, satire sort of way&quot;, with &quot;excellent pacing&quot; and &quot;irresistible&quot; characters.

<text>Iván Rodríguez Torres (born November 27, 1971), nicknamed &quot;Pudge&quot; and &quot;I-Rod&quot;, is a Puerto Rican former Major League Baseball catcher. A member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Rodríguez is widely regarded as one of the greatest catchers in MLB history. He played for the Texas Rangers (in two separate stints, comprising the majority of his career), Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Washington Nationals.

Rodríguez was awarded the AL MVP award in 1999. He won the 2003 World Series with the Florida Marlins and played in the 2006 World Series while with the Tigers. In 2009, he set an MLB record by catching his 2,227th game, passing Carlton Fisk. He had the best career caught-stealing percentage of any major league catcher, at 45.68% (versus a league average of 31%), and he had nine seasons with a caught-stealing rate of 50% or higher. Only one major league catcher (Yadier Molina) has more putouts. Rodríguez recorded 2,844 hits in his career, the most of any catcher in MLB history.

In 2017, Rodríguez was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. In October 2024, he was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in Detroit. After retiring from baseball, he served as a Shadow Representative from Puerto Rico.

==Early life==
Rodríguez was born in Manatí, Puerto Rico and raised in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. His father, José was his baseball coach and his mother, Eva Torres, was an elementary school teacher. Iván&#x27;s first job involved delivering flyers in the shopping malls in Puerto Rico.

He learned baseball at an early age, his biggest rival being Juan González, whom he often played against in his youth. As a Little League player and just 8 years old, he moved from pitcher and third baseman (his favorite position) to catcher because his father, who was also his coach, thought he was throwing too hard and scaring opposing players with his pitches.

His favorite player growing up was Johnny Bench, even before he was changed to the catcher position. The reason for this was that, according to Rodríguez, the Big Red Machine teams for whom Bench played were constantly on TV in Puerto Rico, and he saw how good Bench was. Rodríguez attended Lino Padron Rivera High School, where he was discovered by scout Luis Rosa. Rosa reported that &quot;He showed leadership at 16 that I&#x27;d seen in few kids. He knew where he was going.&quot; Rodríguez signed a contract with the Texas Rangers in July 1988, at the age of 16, and began his professional baseball career.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Rodríguez made his professional debut in 1989 at the age of 17 as catcher for the Gastonia Rangers of the South Atlantic League. In his first game, he went 3-for-3 at the plate against Spartanburg. Playing in the Florida State League in 1990, Rodríguez was selected the best catcher in the league and named to the All-Star team. He placed 15th in the league in batting at .287, and led his team in runs batted in, with 55. He also played in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente (LBPRC) over the offseason.

At the beginning of the 1991 season, Rodriguez played 50 games with the Tulsa Drillers, a AA team, where he batted .274 in 175 at-bats. He was considered the number one prospect of the Texas League. Before the middle of the season, he was called up to the Texas Rangers, thus bypassing AAA.

===Texas Rangers (1991–2002)===
Making his debut with the Texas Rangers on June 20, 1991, he became the youngest player to catch in a major league game that season at 19 years of age. He immediately established himself as an excellent hitter who was also proficient in throwing out would-be base-stealers. He started many of the Rangers games at the end of the season, including 81 of the last 102. Rodríguez became the youngest player in the history of the Texas Rangers to hit a home run, on August 30, 1991, facing the Kansas City Royals and right-hander Storm Davis. He was named to the Major League Baseball (MLB) Rookie All-Star team by both Topps and Baseball America and finished in fourth place in the AL Rookie of the Year voting. He also placed first in throwing out runners, catching 48.6 percent of runners attempting to steal.

In 1992, Rodríguez started 112 games behind the plate and was the youngest player in the major leagues for the second year in a row. Playing in the Puerto Rico Winter League, he had a .262 batting average playing in 17 games for Mayagüez. In the 1993 season, Rodríguez batted .273, had 66 runs batted in and hit 10 home runs, ranking fourth, fifth, and fifth on his team respectively. He had a stretch of eight straight hits over two games facing the Kansas City Royals on July 26 and July 28. He played the final month of the regular season in the Puerto Rican Winter league, where he had a .425 batting average and 14 runs batted in for Mayagüez. Rodríguez was named to the Puerto Rican Winter League all-star team and was also the league Most Valuable Player (MVP). In 1994, Rodríguez led the American League in batting average among catchers, at .298. He placed high on his team in many statistics, placing second in batting average (.298), tied for third in doubles (19), and fourth in hits, total bases, runs, home runs, walks, games, and at bats. He also caught Kenny Rogers&#x27; perfect game on July 28. Rodríguez played in the Puerto Rican Winter League over the winter, but he suffered a severe knee injury which kept him from playing for the rest of the season.

 Playing for the Rangers during the 1995 season, Rodríguez led his team in batting, total bases, and doubles, at .303, 221, and 32 respectively. He was named the Texas Rangers&#x27; player of the year. Rodríguez also had his first multi-home run game while playing the Boston Red Sox on July 13, hitting both off All-Star pitcher Roger Clemens. He also played for Caguas in the Puerto Rican Winter League during the offseason.

In 1996, Rodríguez set an MLB record for most doubles by a catcher, amassing 47 over the course of the season. This broke the previous mark of 42, set by Mickey Cochrane in 1930. He also set the major league record for at-bats by a catcher in a single season, with 639, which surpassed Johnny Bench&#x27;s record of 621 in 1970. He led the Texas Rangers in doubles, at bats, hits, and runs scored. He was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star team that played a series in Japan against the Japanese all-stars after the season was over. He again played in the Puerto Rican Winter League this season. In the 1997 season, Rodríguez also placed first among catchers in many categories in Major League Baseball. These categories were hits, runs, runs batted in, and doubles. He placed second in home runs among catchers, below only Sandy Alomar Jr. of the Cleveland Indians, who had 20 home runs. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated on the week of August 4. This marked the fourth time a player from the Texas Rangers had been on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Rodríguez played in the Puerto Rican Winter League yet again, where he had a .285 batting average, four home runs, and 18 runs batted in over the course of 32 games playing for Caguas.

In the 1998 season, Rodríguez led the Texas Rangers in batting average at .325, which placed eighth in the American League. He also had 75 multi-hit games and 186 hits, finishing seventh and ninth in MLB respectively. He finished second on the Rangers in hits, total bases, triples, and slugging percentage. Rodríguez was third on the team in doubles, home runs, and stolen bases, and fourth in runs batted in. He recorded his 1,000th career hit in a game facing the Cleveland Indians on May 10 of that season. Rodríguez also became the first catcher in the history of Major League Baseball to have two or more seasons with 40 or more doubles. He was selected to the American League All-Star Team again, and he was also named to all-star teams by The Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America.

In 1999, Rodríguez was selected as the American League MVP. He set a new American League record for home runs in a single season among catchers with 35. Rodríguez was also the first catcher to have more than 30 home runs, 100 runs batted in, and 100 runs scored in the history of Major League Baseball. In addition, he holds the distinction of being the first catcher in the history of the league to amass more than 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases. From May 8 to June 1, 1999, Rodríguez had a career-high 20-game hitting streak. He had 25 stolen bases, which was fifth most among catchers in the history of the league. He led the league in times grounded into a double play, with 31. Rodríguez was only the ninth catcher in the history of Major League Baseball to win the Most Valuable Player award, and he was the first to win it since Thurman Munson in 1976. He was named on all of the ballots, getting seven first place votes and six second place votes. Rodríguez was the sixth Puerto Rican to win the award, and the fourth player from the Texas Rangers to win it. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time in a row and was selected Most Valuable Player by &quot;Baseball Digest&quot;. He was again named to all-star teams by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America. While he was hitting home runs, he rarely drew walks. He is one of only six players active in 2009 who have had at least 30 home runs in a season in which they had more homers than walks (34 home runs, 24 walks in 1999). The others are Alfonso Soriano (39–23 in 2002, 36–33 in 2005, 33–31 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35–24 in 2000), Ryan Braun (34–29 in 2007), Joe Crede (30–28 in 2006), and José Guillén (31–24 in 2003).

In 2000, Rodríguez suffered a season-ending injury in a game against the Anaheim Angels. While trying to make a throw to second base, his thumb made contact with the swing of Mo Vaughn&#x27;s bat. He fractured his right thumb and underwent surgery the next day. This injury caused him to miss the rest of the season. Rodríguez appeared in just 91 games, which was the fewest that he appeared in since his first season in the league, 1991. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Alex Rodriguez (2002), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). Even though he was injured, he was still named to the second-team of Baseball America&#x27;s Major League Baseball All-Star Team.

Rodríguez returned to full action in 2001 and had another all-star season. He was selected to his ninth straight MLB All-Star Game, which tied the all-time record set by Johnny Bench. He also tied Bench&#x27;s record of ten straight Rawlings Gold Glove Awards in a row. He batted .308, making 2001 his seventh straight season with a batting average of over .300. He had 25 home runs, 136 hits, and 65 RBI. He also posted a career-best 60.3% caught stealing rate, in a year when the league average was 29%.

Rodríguez&#x27;s final year in his first stint with the Texas Rangers came in 2002. His .314 batting average was seventh best among American League players. This was his eighth season in a row with batting average of .300 or above. He also had 32 doubles, two triples, and 60 runs batted in while playing in 108 games for the Rangers. Rodríguez was placed on the disabled list on April 23 after suffering a herniated disk on April 15. The injury did not require surgery, and he rehabilitated while playing for Class-A Charlotte. He later returned to the Rangers and played there for the remainder of the season. After the 2002 season, his contract with Texas expired and he became a free agent.

===Florida Marlins (2003)===
On January 22, 2003, Rodríguez signed a one-year, $10 million contract with the Florida Marlins. By then a major-league veteran of over a decade, he helped lead the young team to victory in the World Series. During the 2003 regular season, he set many Marlins single season records for a catcher, such as batting average, at .297, and runs batted in, at 85. On March 31, Rodríguez became the tenth Marlins player ever to hit a home run in the team&#x27;s first game of the season. On April 8, he set a Marlins single game record by drawing five walks in a game against the New York Mets.

He had a nine-game hitting streak from June 24 to July 2, during which he batted .500 with seven doubles, two triples, and four home runs. From June 24 to July 1, he drove in a run in eight consecutive games, another single season record for the Marlins. In the postseason, he was named National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career. He also closed out the National League Division Series by holding onto the ball during a dramatic game-ending collision at the plate with J. T. Snow in Game 4. He chose not to return to the Marlins following the 2003 season.

===Detroit Tigers (2004–2008)===

Before the 2004 season, Rodríguez signed a four-year, $40 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. In 2004, he was selected to the MLB All-Star Game for the 11th time in his career and for his 10th time as a starting player, joining Johnny Bench and Mike Piazza as the only Major League Baseball catchers to start an All-Star game 10 times or more in their career. During the month of June, he batted .500 and was named the American League Player of the Month. He also won his 10th consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award, making him the first player on the Detroit Tigers to win the award since Gary Pettis won it in 1989. He won his seventh career Silver Slugger Award, tied with Víctor Martínez of the Cleveland Indians. He was fourth in the American League in batting average and fourth among all Major League Baseball catchers. On October 1, he recorded his 1,000th career RBI in a game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

Prior to the 2005 season, Jose Canseco, in his controversial book &quot;&quot;, claimed to have personally injected Rodríguez with anabolic steroids during their time as teammates on the Texas Rangers. Rodríguez denied the allegations and said he was &quot;in shock&quot; over Canseco&#x27;s claims. Rodríguez arrived at spring training in 2005 weighing 193 lbs.; his 2004 playing weight had been 215 lbs. Given that Major League Baseball implemented a more stringent regime of testing for performance-enhancing drugs in 2005, the &quot;significant weight loss&quot; experienced by Rodríguez &quot;raised more than a few eyebrows&quot;. Rodríguez asserted that his weight loss was the result of changes in his diet and exercise. Asked by a reporter in 2009 whether his name was on the list of 104 players who tested positive for steroids during baseball&#x27;s 2003 survey testing, Rodríguez responded, &quot;Only God knows.&quot;

Despite the off-season controversy, the 2005 season turned out to be another All-Star year for Rodríguez. He was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game for the 12th time in his career, and he participated in the Century 21 Home Run Derby on the day before the All-Star game, finishing second to Bobby Abreu of the Philadelphia Phillies in his home stadium of Comerica Park. For the season, he batted .276 with 14 home runs and 50 runs batted in. On October 26, 2005, Major League Baseball named him the catcher on their Latino Legends Team.

In 2006, Rodríguez returned to throwing out runners attempting to steal a base at a very high percentage, as he did in his earlier career; he was first in the league in this category, throwing out 45.7 percent of all runners attempting to steal a base. On May 9, 2006, Rodríguez played first base for the Tigers. That game, a 7–6 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, was the first time that he played a position other than catcher in his 1,914 Major League games. On August 15, 2006, he also made his first Major League appearance at second base after regular second baseman Plácido Polanco was injured in a game in Boston. Rodríguez was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding catcher in MLB in 2006. Rodríguez would help the Tigers upset the Yankees in the 2006 ALDS and the A&#x27;s in the 2006 ALCS to help Detroit win the pennant.

On April 16, 2007, he batted in six runs on the way to a 12–5 victory over the Kansas City Royals. On June 12 he caught Justin Verlander&#x27;s first no-hitter, the second no-hitter he caught in his career. In 2007, Rodríguez walked in only 1.8 percent of his plate appearances, the lowest percentage in the major leagues. On October 9, the Tigers announced that they were picking up the fifth-year, $13 million option on Rodríguez&#x27;s contract, keeping him on the Tigers team through at least the 2008 season. The team could have bought out the option for $3 million and allowed him to become a free agent.

In spring training in 2008 he led the major leagues with eight home runs. On April 10 against Boston, he got his 2,500th hit.

===New York Yankees (2008)===

On July 30, 2008, Rodríguez was traded to the New York Yankees for relief pitcher Kyle Farnsworth after starting Yankee catcher Jorge Posada had season-ending surgery. While Rodríguez wanted to leave Detroit due to Tigers manager Jim Leyland&#x27;s decision to use rotating catchers, he wound up sharing catching duties with back-up Yankee catcher José Molina, starting only 26 of the remaining 55 games of the 2008 season. With his customary number 7 having been retired by the Yankees for Mickey Mantle, Rodríguez changed his jersey number to 12. He finished the year with a .278 batting average with his time on the Yankees being his worst part of the season.

===Return to Puerto Rican League===
In preparation for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Rodríguez returned to the Puerto Rico Baseball League (formerly LBPPR) during the offseason, following ten years of absence. Playing for the Criollos de Caguas, he gathered a batting average of .370 with three runs batted in and one home run in six games during the regular season. Upon leaving the team on vacation, Rodríguez noted that his intention was to return to action if the Criollos advanced to the playoffs. He returned to action in a &quot;sudden death&quot; game for the final postseason space, but the team lost and was eliminated. On January 8, 2008, the Leones de Ponce reclaimed Rodríguez in the last turn of a special post-season draft, where players from eliminated teams were selected to reinforce those that qualified. In the first week of December 2009, Rodríguez re-joined the Criollos de Caguas in the PRBL.

===Houston Astros (2009)===

On March 20, 2009, Rodríguez signed a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Houston Astros. Rodríguez was given the opportunity to make an additional $1.5 million in performance bonuses. In a situation similar to his tenure with the Yankees, his customary number 7 had been retired by the Astros in honor of Craig Biggio, so Rodríguez initially wore jersey number 12, then later changed to number 77 mid-season.

On May 17, 2009, Rodríguez hit his 300th career home run off of Chicago Cubs pitcher Rich Harden at Wrigley Field. On June 17, 2009, Rodríguez caught his 2,227th career game, passing Carlton Fisk for the most games caught in a career; the game was against his former team (the Rangers) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.

===Second stint with Rangers (2009)===
On August 18, 2009, Rodríguez was traded to the Texas Rangers for minor league reliever Matt Nevarez and two PTBNL. Teammate David Murphy switched his uniform number to #14 so Rodríguez could wear the #7 he previously wore with the Rangers. In his first game back with the Rangers, Rodríguez went 3-for-4 with an RBI double and two singles. He hit his first home run with the Rangers since 2002 on August 29, a solo shot against Minnesota Twins reliever José Mijares.

He finished the 2009 season ranked first in major league history with 13,910 putouts as a catcher, ahead of Brad Ausmus (12,671).

===Washington Nationals (2010–2011)===

Following the 2009 season, Rodríguez filed for free agency, declining the Rangers&#x27; offer of salary arbitration. On December 11, 2009, Rodríguez signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Washington Nationals.

Rodríguez hit his first home run as a member of the Nationals on May 6 against Tim Hudson of the Atlanta Braves. Facing the New York Mets at Citi Field four days later, he went 4-for-4 and drove in the eventual game-winning RBI. On May 24, Rodríguez was hitting .325, but was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a back sprain. Rodríguez returned from the DL in time to catch for Stephen Strasburg&#x27;s Major League debut on June 8, 2010. Nationals pitching coach Steve McCatty instructed Strasburg to throw whatever Rodriguez called, which he did the entire game, except for the first pitch. Strasburg struck out 14 batters and walked none over seven complete innings, which has been described as one of the greatest major league pitching debuts of all time. In a postgame interview, Pudge reacted that &quot;[e]verybody [was] impressed with what this kid did.&quot; In 2011, Rodríguez platooned at catcher for the Nationals with Wilson Ramos. Nationals GM Mike Rizzo later said signing Rodriguez to the team &quot;turned out to be one of the best things we’ve done. He taught us to be a professional franchise.&quot;

===Career statistics===
In 2,543 games over 21 seasons, Rodríguez posted a .296 batting average (2,844-for-9,592) with 1,354 runs, 572 doubles, 51 triples, 311 home runs, 1,332 RBI, 127 stolen bases, 513 bases on balls, .334 on-base percentage and .464 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .991 fielding percentage. In 40 postseason games, he hit .255 (39-for-153) with 17 runs, 9 doubles, 4 home runs, 25 RBI and 14 walks.

==International career==
===World Baseball Classic (Puerto Rico)===
Rodríguez represented Puerto Rico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Rodríguez was one of several Major League Baseball players that committed to represent their birthplaces before the organization of the tournament. He also played for Puerto Rico in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and was named to the classic&#x27;s All-World Baseball Classic team.

==Retirement and honors==

Rodríguez announced his retirement on April 18, 2012. He signed a one-day contract with the Rangers on April 23, retiring as a member of the team. Rodríguez also threw out the ceremonial first pitch during the Rangers home game against the New York Yankees. Instead of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch from the mound, he went to his usual position behind the plate and threw from behind home plate to second base to Michael Young. Rodríguez was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame on February 27, 2014. He also joined FOX Sports Southwest in 2014 as an analyst for pre and postgame television coverage. He joined the Rangers front office as a special assistant to the general manager in February 2013 and continues in that role as of the 2024 season.

In 2017, Rodríguez became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Richard Justice of MLB.com argued that he was &quot;unquestionably&quot; a Hall of Fame-caliber player, writing on MLB.com in 2012 that he batted better than .290 with more than 2,500 hits, 550 doubles, 300 home runs and 1,300 RBI, an accomplishment equaled only by four all-time greats: Hank Aaron, George Brett, Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds. Justice acknowledged that like Bonds, Rodríguez may have difficulty winning election to the Hall of Fame due to suspicion that he used steroids during his career, &quot;USA Today&quot; expressed similar sentiments. On January 18, 2017, Rodríguez was elected to the Hall of Fame on his first ballot, receiving 76% of the vote. He became the first former Washington Nationals player in the Hall of Fame.

Rodriguez was inducted into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown on July 30, 2017. On August 12, 2017, the Rangers retired his jersey #7 with the team (and the opponent, Houston Astros) wearing throwback jerseys to the 1999 era in which Rodriguez played.
In August 2017, Rodríguez was selected by then-Governor Ricardo Rosselló as one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s five shadow representatives. Before the start of Game 1 of the 2023 World Series, Former President of the United States George W. Bush threw the ceremonial first pitch to Rodríguez.

==Personal life==

Rodríguez married Maribel Rivera on June 20, 1991. That same night, having been called up from double A (Rodriguez bypassed AAA) by the Texas Rangers, Rodríguez made his major league debut, in which he threw out two White Sox would-be base stealers. Rodríguez has three children: Dereck, Amanda, and Ivanna. In 1993, Rodríguez and his wife founded the &quot;Ivan &quot;Pudge&quot; Rodríguez Foundation&quot;, whose purpose is to help families in Puerto Rico, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. Rodríguez has also stated that the Make-a-Wish Foundation is one of his charities of choice. Their 15-year marriage ended in 2006 and Rodríguez married Colombia native Patricia Gómez in 2007.

<doc id="552168" wikidata="Q260732" url="?curid=552168" title="Working time">
<text>Working time or laboring time is the period of time that a person spends at paid labor. Unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week.

Many countries regulate the work week by law, such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods, annual holidays, and a maximum number of working hours per week. Working time may vary from person to person, often depending on economic conditions, location, culture, lifestyle choice, and the profitability of the individual&#x27;s livelihood. For example, someone who is supporting children and paying a large mortgage might need to work more hours to meet basic costs of living than someone of the same earning power with lower housing costs. In developed countries like the United Kingdom, some workers are part-time because they are unable to find full-time work, but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family; some choose it simply to increase leisure time.

Standard working hours (or normal working hours) refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day, per week, per month or per year. The employer pays higher rates for overtime hours as required in the law. Standard working hours of countries worldwide are around 40 to 44 hours per week (but not everywhere: from 35 hours per week in France to up to 60 hours per week in nations such as Bhutan. Maximum working hours refers to the maximum working hours of an employee. The employee cannot work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law.

In advanced economies, working time has declined substantially over time while labor productivity and real wages have increased. In 1900, American workers worked 50% more than their counterparts today. The World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization estimated that globally in 2016 one in ten workers were exposed to working 55 or more hours per week and 745,000 persons died as a result of having a heart disease event or a stroke attributable to having worked these long hours, making exposure to long working hours the occupational risk factor with the largest disease burden.

== Hunter-gatherer ==
Since the 1960s, the consensus among anthropologists, historians, and sociologists has been that early hunter-gatherer societies enjoyed more leisure time than is permitted by capitalist and agrarian societies; for instance, one camp of !Kung Bushmen was estimated to work two-and-a-half days per week, at around 6 hours a day. Aggregated comparisons show that on average the working day was less than five hours.

Subsequent studies in the 1970s examined the Machiguenga of the Upper Amazon and the Kayapo of northern Brazil. These studies expanded the definition of work beyond purely hunting-gathering activities, but the overall average across the hunter-gatherer societies he studied was still below 4.86 hours, while the maximum was below 8 hours. Popular perception is still aligned with the old academic consensus that hunter-gatherers worked far in excess of modern humans&#x27; forty-hour week.

== History ==


The Industrial Revolution made it possible for a larger segment of the population to work year-round, because this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day. Peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to work in urban factories, and working time during the year increased significantly. Before collective bargaining and worker protection laws, there was a financial incentive for a company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours. Records indicate that work schedules as long as twelve to sixteen hours per day, six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites.

Over the 20th century, work hours shortened by almost half, partly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth and competition for skilled workers, with a supporting role from trade unions, collective bargaining, and progressive legislation. The workweek, in most of the industrialized world, dropped steadily, to about 40 hours after World War II. The limitation of working hours is also proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and European Social Charter. The decline continued at a faster pace in Europe: for example, France adopted a 35-hour workweek in 2000. In 1995, China adopted a 40-hour week, eliminating half-day work on Saturdays (though this is not widely practiced). Working hours in industrializing economies like South Korea, though still much higher than the leading industrial countries, are also declining steadily.

Technology has also continued to improve worker productivity, permitting standards of living to rise as hours decline. In developed economies, as the time needed to manufacture goods has declined, more working hours have become available to provide services, resulting in a shift of much of the workforce between sectors.

Economic growth in monetary terms tends to be concentrated in health care, education, government, criminal justice, corrections, and other activities rather than those that contribute directly to the production of material goods.

In the mid-2000s, the Netherlands was the first country in the industrialized world where the overall average working week dropped to less than 30 hours.

=== Gradual decrease ===
Most countries in the developed world have seen average hours worked decrease significantly. For example, in the U.S in the late 19th century it was estimated that the average work week was over 60 hours per week. Today the average hours worked in the U.S. is around 33, with the average man employed full-time for 8.4 hours per work day, and the average woman employed full-time for 7.9 hours per work day.
The front runners for lowest average weekly work hours are the Netherlands with 27 hours, and France with 30 hours. In a 2011 report of 26 OECD countries, Germany had the lowest average working hours per week at 25.6 hours.

The New Economics Foundation has recommended moving to a 21-hour standard work week to address problems with unemployment, high carbon emissions, low well-being, entrenched inequalities, overworking, family care, and the general lack of free time. Bill Schaninger writing for McKinsey &amp; Company has put forward a similar proposal of a 20-hour workweek. Others, such as the historian Rutger Bregman, have argued that a 15-hour work week is reachable by 2030 and British sociologist Peter Fleming has proposed a three-day work-week. Actual work week lengths have been falling in the developed world.

Factors that have contributed to lowering average work hours and increasing standard of living have been:
* Technological advances in efficiency such as mechanization, robotics and information technology.
* More women participating in the workforce and fewer homemakers
* Dropping fertility rates leading to fewer children needing support

Recent articles supporting a four-day week have argued that reduced work hours would increase consumption and invigorate the economy. However, other articles state that consumption would decrease, which could reduce the environmental impact. Other arguments for the four-day week include improvements to workers&#x27; level of education (due to having extra time to take classes and courses) and improvements to workers&#x27; health (less work-related stress and extra time for exercise). Reduced hours also save money on day care costs and transportation, which in turn helps the environment with less carbon-related emissions. These benefits increase workforce productivity on a per-hour basis.

== Workweek structure ==

The structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures. Among salaried workers in the western world, the work week often consists of Monday to Friday or Saturday with the weekend set aside as a time of personal work and leisure. Sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the Christian sabbath.

The traditional American business hours are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday to Friday, representing a workweek of five eight-hour days comprising 40 hours in total. These are the origin of the phrase 9-to-5, used to describe a conventional and possibly tedious job. Negatively used, it connotes a tedious or unremarkable occupation. The phrase also indicates that a person is an employee, usually in a large company, rather than an entrepreneur or self-employed. More neutrally, it connotes a job with stable hours and low career risk, but still a position of subordinate employment. The actual time at work often varies between hours in practice due to some employers counting breaks as part of the 40 hours and others not. In many traditional white collar positions, employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses, hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination. Workplace hours have become more flexible, but the phrase is still commonly used even in situations where the term does not apply literally.

==Average annual hours per worker==
The following list is the average annual hours worked by participants in the labor force of the OECD member states. As of 2022, Colombia, Mexico, and Costa Rica ranked the highest number of hours worked per year. Greece ranked the highest In EU with 1886 average hours per year, while Germany ranked the lowest with 1340 average hours worked respectively. Japan and Canada ranked lowest amongst non-European countries.
=== Trends over time ===
==By region==

===Asia===
====India====
Indian labour law has, in theory, offered protection to labour rights. However, the average office worker, women and the IT sector are unofficially forced to work overtime without overtime pay. The software billionaire CEO Narayana Murthy recently stated, “Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not-so-desirable habits from the West. My request is that our youngsters must say – ‘This is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week’. This is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War”. This sparked a national debate with many male CEO&#x27;s strongly supporting 70-hour workweeks to boost productivity and cover losses due to the Corona Pandemic. A 70-hour workweek translates to working approximately 12 hours a day, for six days a week, a phenomenon unofficially occurring in the IT industry. Women in all workplaces are at risk of overwork despite the existence of work laws. Many women already worked much more than 70 hours a week - at both the office and their homes. Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year old a young Chartered Accountant (CA) from Kerala, had started working in the E&amp;Y Pune office on 18th March 2024, but her premature death within 4 months on 20th July 2024 due to stress caused by overwork, presenteeism, exhaustion and fatigue has re-ignited the debate about toxic work culture in India. Since the pandemic began, various Indian CEOs have repeatedly advocated for this work culture.

====South Korea====
South Korea has the fastest shortening working time in the OECD, which is the result of the government&#x27;s proactive move to lower working hours at all levels and to increase leisure and relaxation time, which introduced the mandatory forty-hour, five-day working week in 2004 for companies with over 1,000 employees. Beyond regular working hours, it is legal to demand up to 12 hours of overtime during the week, plus another 16 hours on weekends. The 40-hour workweek expanded to companies with 300 employees or more in 2005, 100 employees or more in 2006, 50 or more in 2007, 20 or more in 2008 and a full inclusion to all workers nationwide in July 2011. The government has continuously increased public holidays to 16 days in 2013, more than the 10 days of the United States and double that of the United Kingdom&#x27;s 8 days. Despite those efforts, South Korea&#x27;s work hours are still relatively long, with an average 1,874 hours per year in 2023

====Japan====

Work hours in Japan are decreasing, but many Japanese still work long hours. Recently, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) issued a draft report recommending major changes to the regulations that govern working hours. The centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white-collar workers. Japan has enacted an 8-hour work day and 40-hour work week (44 hours in specified workplaces). The overtime limits are: 15 hours a week, 27 hours over two weeks, 43 hours over four weeks, 45 hours a month, 81 hours over two months and 120 hours over three months; however, some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours a day without &#x27;clocking in&#x27; whether physically or metaphorically. The overtime allowance should not be lower than 125% and not more than 150% of the normal hourly rate. Workaholism in Japan is considered a serious social problem leading to early death, a phenomenon dubbed &quot;karōshi&quot;, meaning death from overwork.

====Mainland China====

China adopted a 40-hour week, eliminating half-day work on Saturdays.

Traditionally, Chinese have worked long hours, and this has led to many deaths from overwork, with the state media reporting in 2014 that 600,000 people were dying suddenly annually, some of them were dying from overwork. Despite this, work hours have reportedly been falling for about three decades due to rising productivity, better labor laws, and the spread of the two-day weekend. The trend has affected both factories and white-collar companies that have been responding to growing demands for easier work schedules.
The 996 working hour system, as it is known, is where employees work from 09:00 to 21:00, six days a week, excluding two hours of lunch &amp; nap during the noon and one hour of supper in the evening. Alibaba founder Jack (Yun) Ma, and JD.Com founder Richard (Qiangdong) Liu both praise the 996 schedule, saying such a schedule has helped Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent grow to become what they are today.

====Hong Kong====
Hong Kong has no legislation regarding maximum and normal working hours.
The average weekly working hours of full-time employees in Hong Kong is 49 hours. According to the Price and Earnings Report 2012 conducted by UBS, while the global and regional average were 1,915 and 2,154 hours per year respectively, the average working hours in Hong Kong is 2,296 hours per year, which ranked the fifth longest yearly working hours among 72 countries under study. In addition, from the survey conducted by the Public Opinion Study Group of the University of Hong Kong, 79% of the respondents agree that the problem of overtime work in Hong Kong is &quot;severe&quot;, and 65% of the respondents support the legislation on the maximum working hours. In Hong Kong, 70% of surveyed do not receive any overtime remuneration. These show that people in Hong Kong concerns the working time issues. As Hong Kong implemented the minimum wage law in May 2011, the Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, of the Special Administrative Region pledged that the government will standardize working hours in Hong Kong.

On 26 November 2012, the Labour Department of the HKSAR released the &quot;Report of the policy study on standard working hours&quot;. The report covers three major areas, including: (1) the regimes and experience of other places in regulating working hours, (2) latest working time situations of employees in different sectors, and (3) estimation of the possible impact of introducing standard working hour in Hong Kong. Under the selected parameters, from most loosen to most stringent, the estimated increase in labour cost vary from 1.1 billion to 55 billion HKD, and affect 957,100 (36.7% of total employees) to 2,378,900 (91.1% of total) employees.

Various sectors of the community show concerns about the standard working hours in Hong Kong. The points are summarized as below:

====Labor organizations====
Hong Kong Catholic Commission For Labour Affairs urges the government to legislate the standard working hours in Hong Kong, and suggests a 44 hours standard, 54 hours maximum working hours in a week. The organization thinks that long working time adversely affects the family and social life and health of employees; it also indicates that the current Employment Ordinance does not regulate overtime pays, working time limits nor rest day pays, which can protect employees rights.

====Businesses and related organizations====
Generally, business sector agrees that it is important to achieve work–life balance, but does not support a legislation to regulate working hours limit. They believe &quot;standard working hours&quot; is not the best way to achieve work–life balance and the root cause of the long working hours in Hong Kong is due to insufficient labor supply. The managing director of Century Environmental Services Group, Catherine Yan, said &quot;Employees may want to work more to obtain a higher salary due to financial reasons. If standard working hour legislation is passed, employers will need to pay a higher salary to employees, and hence the employers may choose to segment work tasks to employer more part time employees instead of providing overtime pay to employees.&quot; She thinks this will lead to a situation that the employees may need to find two part-time jobs to earn their living, making them wasting more time on transportation from one job to another.

The Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, Chow Chung-kong believes that it is so difficult to implement standard working hours that apply &quot;across-the-board&quot;, specifically, to accountants and barristers. In addition, he believes that standard working hours may decrease individual employees&#x27; working hours and would not increase their actual income. It may also lead to an increase of number of part-timers in the labor market.

According to a study conducted jointly by the Business, Economic and Public Affairs Research Centre and Enterprise and Social Development Research Centre of Hong Kong Shue Yan University, 16% surveyed companies believe that a standard working hours policy can be considered, and 55% surveyed think that it would be difficult to implement standard working hours in businesses.

Employer representative in the Labour Advisory Board, Stanley Lau, said that standard working hours will completely alter the business environment of Hong Kong, affect small and medium enterprise and weaken competitiveness of businesses. He believes that the government can encourage employers to pay overtime salary, and there is no need to regulate standard working hours.

====Political parties====
On 17–18 October 2012, the Legislative Council members in Hong Kong debated on the motion &quot;legislation for the regulation of working hours&quot;. Cheung Kwok-che proposed the motion &quot;That is the Council urges the Government to introduce a bill on the regulation of working hours within this legislative session, the contents of which must include the number of standard weekly hours and overtime pay&quot;. As the motion was not passed by both functional constituencies and geographical constituencies, it was negatived.

The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions suggested a standard 44-hour work week with overtime pay of 1.5 times the usual pay. It believes the regulation of standard working hour can prevent the employers to force employees to work (overtime) without pay.

Elizabeth Quat of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), believed that standard working hours were a labor policy and was not related to family-friendly policies. The Vice President of Young DAB, Wai-hung Chan, stated that standard working hours would bring limitations to small and medium enterprises. He thought that the government should discuss the topic with the public more before legislating standard working hours.

The Democratic Party suggested a 44-hour standard work week and compulsory overtime pay to help achieve the balance between work, rest and entertainment of people in Hong Kong.

The Labour Party believed regulating working hours could help achieve a work–life balance. It suggests an 8-hour work day, a 44-hour standard work week, a 60-hour maximum work week and an overtime pay of 1.5 times the usual pay.

Poon Siu-ping of Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions thought that it is possible to set work hour limit for all industries; and the regulation on working hours can ensure the overtime payment by employers to employees, and protect employees&#x27; health.

The Civic party suggests &quot;to actively study setting weekly standard working hours at 44 hours to align with family-friendly policies&quot; in LegCo Election 2012.

Member of Economic Synergy, Jeffery Lam, believes that standard working hours would adversely affect productivity, tense the employer-employee relationship, and increase the pressure faced by businesses who suffer from inadequate workers. He does not support the regulation on working hours at its current situation.

=====Government=====
Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare Bureau, said the Executive Council has already received the government report on working hours in June, and the Labour Advisory Board and the LegCo&#x27;s Manpower Panel will receive the report in late November and December respectively. On 26 November 2012, the Labour Department released the report, and the report covered the regimes and experience of practicing standard working hours in selected regions, current work hour situations in different industries, and the impact assessment of standard working hours. Also, Matthew Cheung mentioned that the government will form a select committee by first quarter of 2013, which will include government officials, representative of labor unions and employers&#x27; associations, academics and community leaders, to investigate the related issues. He also said that it would &quot;perhaps be unrealistic&quot; to put forward a bill for standard working hours in the next one to two years.

=====Academics=====
Yip Siu-fai, Professor of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration of HKU, has noted that professions such as nursing and accountancy have long working hours and that this may affect people&#x27;s social life. He believes that standard working hours could help to give Hong Kong more family-friendly workplaces and to increase fertility rates. Randy Chiu, Professor of the Department of Management of HKBU, has said that introducing standard working hours could avoid excessively long working hours of employees. He also said that nowadays Hong Kong attains almost full employment, has a high rental price and severe inflation, recently implemented minimum wage, and is affected by a gloomy global economy; he also mentioned that comprehensive considerations on macroeconomic situations are needed, and emphasized that it is perhaps inappropriate to adopt working-time regulation as exemplified in other countries to Hong Kong.

Lee Shu-Kam, Associate Professor of the Department of Economics and Finance of HKSYU, believes that standard working hours cannot deliver &quot;work–life balance&quot;. He referenced the research to the US by the University of California, Los Angeles in 1999 and pointed out that in the industries and regions in which the wage elasticity is low, the effects of standard working hours on lowering actual working time and increasing wages is limited: for regions where the labor supply is inadequate, standard working hours can protect employees&#x27; benefits yet cause unemployment; but for regions (such as Japan) where the problem does not exist, standard working hours would only lead to unemployment.

Francis Lui, Head and Professor of the Department of Economics of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, believed that standard working hours may not lower work time but increase unemployment. He used Japan as an example to illustrate that the implementation of standard working hours lowered productivity per head and demotivated the economy. He also said that even if the standard working hours can shorten employees&#x27; weekly working hours, they may need to work for more years to earn sufficient amount of money for retirement, i.e. delay their retirement age. The total working time over the course of a lifetime may not change.

In 2012, Lok-sang Ho, Professor of Economics and Director of the Centre for Public Policy Studies of Lingnan University, pointed out that &quot;as different employees perform various jobs and under different degrees of pressures, it may not be appropriate to establish standard working hours in Hong Kong&quot;; and he proposed a 50-hour maximum work week to protect workers&#x27; health.

====Taiwan====
In 2018, Taiwan had the world&#x27;s 4th longest work hour and 2nd in Asia, with the average number of work hours hit 2,033 hours. There had been reduction in the work hours by 122 from 2008 to 2018.

====Malaysia====
Since 1 September 2022, the weekly work hour in Malaysia was reduced from 48 hours to 45 hours after it was promulgated in the Dewan Negara.

====Singapore====
Singapore has an 8-hour normal work day (9 hours including lunchtime), a 45-hour normal working week, and a maximum 48-hour work week. If the employee works no more than five days a week, the employee&#x27;s normal working day is 9 hours and the working week is 44 hours. Also, if the number of hours worked by the worker is less than 44 hours every alternate week, the 44-hour weekly limit may be exceeded in the other week. However, this is subject to the pre-specification in the service contract, and the maximum should not exceed 48 hours per week or 88 hours in any consecutive two week period. In addition, a shift worker can work up to 12 hours a day, provided that the average working hours per week do not exceed 44 over a consecutive three-week period. The overtime allowance per overtime hour must not be less than 1.5 times the employee&#x27;s hourly basic rates.

=== Europe ===
In most European Union countries, working time is gradually decreasing. The European Union&#x27;s working time directive imposes a 48-hour maximum working week that applies to every member state except Malta (which have an opt-out, meaning that employees in Malta may work longer than 48 hours if they wish, but they cannot be forced to do so). A major reason for the lower annual hours worked in Europe is a relatively high amount of paid annual leave. Fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard.

==== France ====
France experimented in 2000 with a sharp cut of legal or statutory working time of the employees in the private and public sector from 39 hours a week to 35 hours a week, with the stated goal to fight against rampant unemployment at that time. The Law 2000–37 on working time reduction is also referred to as the Aubry Law, according to the name of the Labor Minister at that time.
Employees may (and do) work more than 35 hours a week, yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses. If the bonus is determined through collective negotiations, it cannot be lower than 10%. If no agreement on working time is signed, the legal bonus must be of 25% for the first 8 hours, then goes up to 50% for the rest.
Including overtime, the maximum working time cannot exceed 48 hours per week, and should not exceed 44 hours per week over 12 weeks in a row. 
In France the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours: part-time jobs should not allow for less than 24 hours per week without a branch collective agreement. These agreements can allow for less, under tight conditions.
According to the official statistics (DARES), after the introduction of the law on working time reduction, actual hours per week performed by full-time employed, fell from 39.6 hours in 1999, to a trough of 37.7 hours in 2002, then gradually went back to 39.1 hours in 2005. In 2016 working hours were of 39.1.

==== United Kingdom ====
The maximum working week in the United Kingdom is 48 hours a week on average, which is typically averaged over 17 weeks. Workers have the choice of opting out of the 48-maximum week. There also exceptions to the maximum working week including – but not limited to – being in the armed forces, emergency services or police. This was established in 1998 by the Working Time Regulations 1998.

=== Mexico ===
Mexican laws mandate a maximum of 48 hours of work per week, but they are rarely observed or enforced due to loopholes in the law, the volatility of labor rights in Mexico, and its underdevelopment relative to other members countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Indeed, private sector employees often work overtime without receiving overtime compensation. Fear of unemployment and threats by employers explain in part why the 48-hour work week is disregarded.

=== Colombia ===
In June 2021, the Colombian Congress approved a bill for the reduction of the work-week, from 48 to 42 hours, which will be implemented in several stages, from 2023 to 2026. In accordance with it, articles 161 to 167 of the Substantive Work Code in Colombia provide for a maximum of 42 hours of work a week, distributed in 5 or 6 days, at the discretion of the employer (as of July 2024, the work-week is 46 hours). Also, the law notes that workdays should be divided into 2 sections to allow a break, usually given as the meal time which is not counted as work. Typically, there is a 2-hours break for lunch that starts from 12:00 through 13:00. 

===Spain===
The main labor law in Spain, the Workers&#x27; Statute Act, limits the amount of working time that an employee is obliged to perform. In the Article 34 of this law, a maximum of 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week are established.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUSLabor 1/2016 54-65&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees typically receive either 12 or 14 payments per year, with approximately 21 days of vacation. According to Spanish law, Spain holds what is known as the Convenios-Colectivos, which stipulates that different regulations and laws regarding employee work week and wage apply based on the type of job. Overall they rank as the 13th highest in regard to international GDP growth.

According to a study of the OECD Better Life Index, 4% of Spanish workers work more than 50 hours per week, compared to an average of 11% of workers in OECD countries.

Working hours are regulated by law. Mandatory logging of employee working time has been in place since 2019 in an attempt by legislators to eliminate unpaid overtime and push for more transparency of actual working hours. Non-regulated pauses during the workday for coffee or smoking are not permitted to be documented as working time, according to a ruling by The Spanish National Court in February 2020.

====Traditional mid-day break====
However, one of the interesting aspects of the Spanish work day and labor is the traditional presence of a break around lunchtime. It is sometimes mistakenly thought to be due to siesta, but in fact was due to workers returning to their families for the main midday meal. That break, typically of 1 or 2 hours, has been kept in the working culture because in the post-civil-war period most workers had two jobs to be able to sustain their families. Following this tradition, in small and medium-sized cities, restaurants and businesses shut down during this time period of 2-5 for retail and 4-8 for restaurants. Many office jobs only allow one hour or even a half hour breaks to eat the meal in office building restaurants or designated lunch rooms.

A majority of adults emphasize the lack of a siesta during the typical work week. Only one in ten Spaniards take a mid-day nap, a percentage less than other European nations.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, between 1974 and 1997 no marked change took place in the average amount of time spent at work by Australians of &quot;prime working age&quot; (that is, between 25 and 54 years of age). Throughout this period, the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australians (including those who did not spend any time at work) remained stable at between 27 and 28 hours per week. This unchanging average, however, masks a significant redistribution of work from men to women. Between 1974 and 1997, the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australian men fell from 45 to 36 hours per week, while the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australian women rose from 12 to 19 hours per week. In the period leading up to 1997, the amount of time Australian workers spent at work outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays also increased.

In 2009, a rapid increase in the number of working hours was reported in a study by The Australia Institute. The study found the average Australian worked 1855 hours per year at work. According to Clive Hamilton of The Australia Institute, this surpasses even Japan. The Australia Institute believes that Australians work the highest number of hours in the developed world.

The 38 hour working week was introduced in 1983.

The majority of full-time employees in Australia work additional overtime hours. A 2015 survey found that of Australia&#x27;s 7.7 million full-time workers, 5 million put in more than 40 hours a week, including 1.4 million who worked more than 50 hours a week and 270,000 who put in more than 70 hours.

=== United States ===
In 2016, the average man employed full-time worked 8.4 hours per work day, and the average woman employed full-time worked 7.8 hours per work day. There is no mandatory minimum amount of paid time off for sickness or holiday but the majority of full-time civilian workers have access to paid vacation time.
By 1946, the United States government had inaugurated the 40-hour work week for all federal employees. Beginning in 1950, under the Truman Administration, the United States became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly (albeit secretly) and permanently forswear a reduction of working time. Given the military-industrial requirements of the Cold War, the authors of the then secret National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) proposed the US government undertake a massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it &quot;siphon off&quot; a part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the Soviet Union. In his 1951 Annual Message to the Congress, President Truman stated:

In terms of manpower, our present defense targets will require an increase of nearly one million men and women in the armed forces within a few months, and probably not less than four million more in defense production by the end of the year. This means that an additional 8 percent of our labor force, and possibly much more, will be required by direct defense needs by the end of the year.
These manpower needs will call both for increasing our labor force by reducing unemployment and drawing in women and older workers, and for lengthening hours of work in essential industries.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average non-farm private sector employee worked 34.5 hours per week as of June 2012.

As President Truman&#x27;s 1951 message had predicted, the share of working women rose from 30 percent of the labor force in 1950 to 47 percent by 2000 – growing at a particularly rapid rate during the 1970s. According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued May 2002, &quot;In 1950, the overall participation rate of women was 34 percent. ... The rate rose to 38 percent in 1960, 43 percent in 1970, 52 percent in 1980, and 58 percent in 1990 and reached 60 percent by 2000. The overall labor force participation rate of women is projected to attain its highest level in 2010, at 62 percent.&quot; The inclusion of women in the work force can be seen as symbolic of social progress as well as of increasing American productivity and hours worked.

Between 1950 and 2007 official price inflation was measured to 861 percent. President Truman, in his 1951 message to Congress, predicted correctly that his military buildup &quot;will cause intense and mounting inflationary pressures.&quot; Using the data provided by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erik Rauch has estimated productivity to have increased by nearly 400%. According to Rauch, &quot;if productivity means anything at all, a worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as a 1950 worker in only 11 hours per week.&quot;

In the United States, the working time for upper-income professionals has increased compared to 1965, while total annual working time for low-skill, low-income workers has decreased. This effect is sometimes called the &quot;leisure gap&quot;.

The average working time of married couples – of both spouses taken together – rose from 56 hours in 1969 to 67 hours in 2000.

==== Overtime rules ====
Many professional workers put in longer hours than the forty-hour standard. In professional industries like investment banking and large law firms, a forty-hour workweek is considered inadequate and may result in job loss or failure to be promoted. Medical residents in the United States routinely work long hours as part of their training.

Workweek policies are not uniform in the U.S. Many compensation arrangements are legal, and three of the most common are &quot;wage&quot;, &quot;commission&quot;, and &quot;salary&quot; payment schemes. Wage earners are compensated on a per-hour basis, whereas salaried workers are compensated on a per-week or per-job basis, and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell.

Under most circumstances, wage earners and lower-level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in a week; however, they are paid extra for the additional work. Many salaried workers and commission-paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws. These are generally called &quot;exempt&quot; positions, because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked. The rules are complex, but generally exempt workers are executives, professionals, or sales staff. For example, school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours. Business owners and independent contractors are considered self-employed, and none of these laws apply to them.

Generally, workers are paid &quot;time-and-a-half&quot;, or 1.5 times the worker&#x27;s base wage, for each hour of work past forty. California also applies this rule to work in excess of eight hours per day, but exemptions and exceptions significantly limit the applicability of this law.

In some states, firms are required to pay &quot;double-time&quot;, or twice the base rate, for each hour of work past 60, or each hour of work past 12 in one day in California, also subject to numerous exemptions and exceptions. This provides an incentive for companies to limit working time, but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker. It is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage-earning workers. Unions often treat overtime as a desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members.

===Brazil===
Brazil has a 44-hour work week, normally 8 hours per day and 4 hours on Saturday or 8.8 hours per day. Jobs with no meal breaks or on-duty meal breaks are 6 hours per day. Public servants work 40 hours per week.

Lunch breaks are one hour and are not usually counted as work. A typical work schedule is 8:00 or 9:00–12:00, 13:00–18:00. In larger cities, workers eat lunch on or near their work site, while some workers in smaller cities may go home for lunch.

A 30-day vacation is mandated by law. Holidays vary by municipality with approximately 13 to 15 holidays per year.

<text>Hogfather is the 20th &quot;Discworld&quot; novel by Terry Pratchett, and a 1997 British Fantasy Award nominee. It was first released in 1996 and published by Victor Gollancz. It came in 137th place in The Big Read, a BBC survey of the most loved British books of all time, making it one of fifteen books by Pratchett in the Top 200.

The book focuses on the absence of the Hogfather, a mythical creature akin to Father Christmas, who grants children&#x27;s wishes on Hogswatchnight (December 32) and brings them presents. While Death attempts to fill in for the Hogfather, his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit tries to find and rescue the Hogfather.

==Plot summary==

The Auditors of Reality, a group of &#x27;celestial bureaucrats&#x27;, attempt to eliminate the Hogfather, a jolly god-like creature who brings children presents on December 32nd, similar to the figures of Santa Claus and Father Christmas in the US and UK. Forbidden to interfere directly by &quot;The Rules&quot;, they pay the Assassin&#x27;s Guild to kill the Hogfather instead. The task is given to Mr. Teatime who has a reputation for ruthlessness and creative solutions. Mr. Teatime enlists the help of some gangsters to find a delivery person working for the Tooth Fairy, using his magic to break into her kingdom and stealing all the collected teeth. With these teeth, he is able to control all the children on the Discworld, commanding them to no longer believe in the Hogfather.

Knowing that the Hogfather is also responsible for the sun rising, Death attempts to maintain belief by dressing up as the Hogfather and fulfilling his role, aided by his servant Albert. Due to Death&#x27;s simplistic understanding of the meaning of Hogswatch, he commits several acts supposedly to aid restoring belief in the Hogfather but which Albert believes are unacceptable, including granting more life to a deceased matchgirl and stealing food from a luxury restaurant to give to the Canting Crew (whilst replacing said restaurant&#x27;s stock with mud and old boots). Since he is unable himself to defeat Mr. Teatime, who is in a realm created by children&#x27;s belief where death (and thus Death) does not exist, he appears at his granddaughter&#x27;s place of work dressed as the Hogfather. As he had planned, Susan Sto Helit is unable to resist her curiosity and tries to find the Hogfather. She visits the Hogfather&#x27;s Castle of Bones, only to find the hung-over Bilious, the &quot;Oh God&quot; of Hangovers. In an attempt to cure Bilious from his hangovers, Susan visits the Unseen University, where it is discovered that several small gods and beings (including Bilious, a Verruca Gnome, a Hair Loss Fairy, an Eater of Pencils, an Eater of Socks, Towel Wasps, and a Cheerful Fairy) are being created due to an abundance of excess belief in the world caused by the Hogfather&#x27;s disappearance.

Susan and Bilious travel to the Tooth Fairy&#x27;s realm and discover Mr. Teatime&#x27;s plot. Mr. Teatime attacks Susan using Death&#x27;s sword, but since it does not work in this realm, Susan is able to overpower him and throw him down the tower, causing him to disappear. After Susan witnesses the Tooth Fairy (in fact, the original Bogey Man, who became the Tooth Fairy to protect children) die from the exhaustion from defending its kingdom, she tasks the childlike Banjo Lilywhite, the last surviving gangster, to carry on the task of protecting the teeth. She then manages to rescue the Hogfather, who has reverted to his former self as a hog, from Auditors who hound him in the form of attack dogs. As Susan is returning to her place of work, Death explains what happened to Susan but she is attacked by Teatime whom she finally manages to kill using the kitchen poker.

==TV adaptation==

A two-part TV film version of &quot;Hogfather&quot; was screened on 17 and 18 December 2006 on Sky One in the UK, with Ian Richardson as the voice of Death and David Jason playing Death&#x27;s manservant Albert. Marc Warren played Mr. Teatime, Michelle Dockery played Susan Sto Helit, Rhodri Meilir played Bilious, and Tony Robinson (who narrated several audiobook versions of the Discworld novels) played the shop keeper Vernon Crumley. Terry Pratchett himself had a brief cameo as the toy-maker.

The US debut was on 25 November 2007 on ION Television, the Australian on 23 and 24 December 2007 on Channel Seven, and the German on 25 December 2007 on ProSieben.

== Reception ==
The novel entered the UK Top 10 charts at #1 as hardback in October 1996 and as paperback in November 1997. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, Pratchett used a darker tone and edgier satire for &quot;Hogfather&quot; than his previous work, and so moved beyond the realm of humorous fantasy and into position as &quot;one of the more significant contemporary English-language satirists&quot;.

<doc id="552180" wikidata="Q2599168" url="?curid=552180" title="Valiant-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Valiant&quot; class were a class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines in service with the Royal Navy from the mid-1960s until 1994. They were the first fully British nuclear fleet submarine; the earlier used an American nuclear reactor. There were only two boats in the class, the first, &quot;Valiant&quot; (the nameship) commissioned in 1966 three years after &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, and &quot;Warspite&quot; the following year. Both were built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness.

==Design==

The class were based on &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, but were enlarged by 20 feet (6 m) and had a dived displacement of 4,900 tons compared to 4,000 tons. Improvements made since the original &quot;Dreadnought&quot; meant that they ran significantly quieter under main power, and also had a Paxman diesel-electric generator that could be used for silent running. In most other respects (outside the power plant), the &quot;Valiant&quot;s were identical to &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.

According to former head of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors R.J. Daniel, when US Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, widely regarded as the father of the nuclear submarine, initially learned of the proposed rafting system for the &quot;Valiant&quot; class, (in which ship&#x27;s machinery is acoustically isolated from the hull by padding known as &quot;rafts&quot;), he was dismissive of the concept, with the result that the Royal Navy gained an advantage in submarine silencing that the United States Navy did not introduce until considerably later.

==Service==
The &quot;Valiant&quot;s were primarily used in the anti-submarine role, important during the Cold War. In 1967 &quot;Valiant&quot; set a Royal Navy (RN) record of sailing 12,000 miles (19,312 km) submerged in twenty-eight days, from Singapore to the UK. Both boats received a number of refits, including the capability to use the Harpoon missile. &quot;Valiant&quot; and other nuclear fleet submarines served in the Falklands War in 1982.

The &quot;Valiant&quot;s had long careers: &quot;Warspite&quot; was decommissioned in 1991, and &quot;Valiant&quot; in 1994, due to cracks being discovered in her primary to secondary cooling system. They were very successful and served as the template for the ballistic missile submarine and subsequent fleet submarines.

<text>Terry Patchett (11 July 1940 – 11 October 1996) was a politician in the United Kingdom.

Patchett served as Member of Parliament for Barnsley East from 1983 until his death, and was a member of the Labour Party.

== Early life ==
Patchett was born in Darfield, South Yorkshire on 11 July 1940. He studied politics and economics at the University of Sheffield.

== Career ==
Before becoming an MP, Patchett worked as a miner for seventeen years. A member of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), he became the branch delegate for Houghton Main in 1966, and from 1977 he was a member of the union&#x27;s Yorkshire executive. From 1969 to 1973 he was also on Wombwell District Council. Though he wanted to be the miners&#x27; agent for Barnsley, in 1982 Arthur Scargill instead offered him the candidacy for the safe Labour seat of Dearne Valley, whose incumbent MP, Edwin Wainwright, was retiring. After boundary changes, he won the redrawn seat of Barnsley East in 1983 with a majority of 17,500 votes.

=== Member of Parliament ===
Patchett felt out of place in the House of Commons and rarely spoke in the chamber. However, he was on the Select Committee on Social Services and served as vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party&#x27;s energy committee.

Defending the interests of mining communities, he opposed the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983, which exempted oil companies from royalties on new fields, denouncing it as an attempt to weaken the NUM. He also opposed the closure of rich collieries such as Barnburgh and plans to increase imports of foreign coal. He was strongly loyal to Scargill and politically was on the left wing of the Labour Party.

Patchett&#x27;s last appearance in Parliament was the vote on the Scott Report on 26 February 1996. Suffering from cancer, he risked his life to go to vote, against his doctor&#x27;s advice and family&#x27;s wishes, because of the opportunity of defeating the government. He made the journey from Darfield to Westminster by ambulance.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1961 Patchett married Glenys Veal, with whom he had three children.

He died of cancer on 11 October 1996 and the subsequent by-election was won by Jeff Ennis.

<doc id="552200" wikidata="Q377685" url="?curid=552200" title="Maria Stuarda">
<text>Maria Stuarda (Mary Stuart) is a tragic opera (&quot;tragedia lirica&quot;), in two acts, by Gaetano Donizetti, to a libretto by Giuseppe Bardari, based on Andrea Maffei&#x27;s translation of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s 1800 play &quot;Maria Stuart&quot;.

The opera is one of a number of operas by Donizetti which deal with the Tudor period in English history, including &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; (named for Henry VIII&#x27;s second wife, Anne Boleyn), &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; (named for a putative lover of Queen Elizabeth I of England) and &quot;Il castello di Kenilworth&quot;. The lead female characters of the operas &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;, and &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; are often referred to as the &quot;Three Donizetti Queens&quot;. The story is loosely based on the lives of Mary, Queen of Scots (Mary Stuart) and her cousin Queen Elizabeth I. Schiller had invented the confrontation of the two Queens, who in fact never met.

After a series of problems surrounding its presentation in Naples after the final dress rehearsal – including having to be re-written for a totally different location, a different time period, and with Buondelmonte as its new title – &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; as we know it today premiered on 30 December 1835 at La Scala in Milan.

==Composition history==

===The appeal of Mary Stuart and Scottish history in 19th–century Italy===

In a variety of areas – drama, literature (fiction or otherwise) – England in the Tudor era (and Scotland at the time of Mary Stuart and beyond in particular, Donizetti&#x27;s own &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; being an example) exerted a fascination upon continental Europeans in an extraordinary way. In literature, it has been noted that more than 20,000 books have appeared about Mary&#x27;s life and that, within two years of her death, stage plays also began to appear. In addition to Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuart&quot;, there had been another influential play, Count Vittorio Alfieri&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; written in 1778 in which &quot;that unfortunate queen is represented unsuspicious, impatient of contradiction and violent in her attachments.&quot;
When it came to what had been handed down about Elizabeth I to Donizetti and other Italian composers, opera stage director Stephen Lawless notes that the continental view would have been very different from the Anglo-centric one of Elizabeth as Good Queen Bess, as Gloriana, and as the one who routed Catholicism from England&#x27;s shores. But from an Italian perspective, Elizabeth was a heretic and, indeed, a bastard since &quot;her father Henry VIII had never obtained an annulment from the Pope to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in order to marry his second wife (Elizabeth&#x27;s mother) Anne Boleyn&quot; Therefore, to European Catholics, Mary was a martyr and the legitimate ruler of England, a sympathetic character contrasted with Elizabeth, who was traditionally cast in a darker role, often &quot;as unrestrainedly jealous, willful, and easily over-wrought. This is the portrait of Elizabeth found, not too unexpectedly, in Bardari&#x27;s libretto&quot;.

As far as Italian opera of the &quot;primo ottocento&quot; is concerned, these attitudes found their way into the works which poured forth: they covered a large portion of the Tudor era, including works about Henry VIII&#x27;s first daughter, Mary, who became Mary I of England, known as &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; for enforcing the country&#x27;s strict return to Catholicism. The appeal of these operas has been expressed by Professor Alexander Weatherson in the 2009 &quot;Donizetti Society Newsletter&quot; as follows (with the addition of relevant opera titles associated with the named composers):
:Scotland’s soil was about to be profaned by a stream of operas that bore the footprint of [Elizabeth’s] rival……without Mary Stuart, Scotland might have been left in peace...In Italy alone in the earliest decades of the nineteenth century there was a Scotch broth of operas by Asap; Capecelatro; Carafa [&quot;I solitari di Scozia&quot;, 1815, and &quot;Elisabetta in Derbyshire ossia Il castello di Fotheringhay&quot;, 1818]; Carlini [&quot;Maria Stuarda, regina di Scozia&quot;, 1818]; Casalini; Casella [&quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;, 1812]; Coccia [&quot;I solitari&quot;, 1811, and &quot;Maria Stuart, regina di Scozia&quot;, 1827]; Donizetti [the subject of the &quot;Newsletter&quot; article]; Ferrari; [The Belgian], Fétis [&quot;Marie Stuart en Ecosse&quot;]; Gabrielli [&quot;Sara ovvero La pazza delle montagne di Scozia&quot;, 1843]; Mazzucato [&quot;La fidanzata di Lammermoor&quot;, 1834]; Mercadante [&quot;Maria Stuarda, regina di Scozia&quot;, 1825]; Neidermeyer [&quot;Marie Stuart&quot;, Paris 1844]; Nicolini; Pacini [&quot;Vallace&quot;, 1820, &quot;Malvina di Scozia&quot;]; Pavesi; Pugni; Rajentroph; the Ricchis [ Federico Ricci and Luigi Ricci ] [&quot;La prigione di Edimburgo&quot;, 1838]; Rossini [&quot;Elisabetta, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot;, 1815]; Sogner [&quot;Maria Stuarda ossia I carbonari di Scozia&quot;, 1814]; and Vaccai [&quot;I solitari di Scozia&quot;, 1815] – and this is just a scratch upon the surface of the European infatuation with the decapitated Stuart and/or her northern fastness which boiled-up in the bloodbath finale of the eighteenth century, operas often rabid and inconsequential, full of fashionable confrontations and artificial conflicts, politically motivated, repetitious and soon forgotten.

But Weatherson concludes: 
:At the heart of the plot, however, lay an Italian, the pulp plays and novels of Camillo Federici (1749–1802) [the pen name of Giovanni Battista Viassolo] a former actor whose prolific vulgarizations of Schiller and August von Kotzebue set Italian librettists scribbling for four decades. Indeed, without him it is to be suspected that Sir Walter Scott would never have captured the imagination of so many poets, nor for so long.

===The libretto for &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;===
Having seen Schiller&#x27;s play in Milan in an Italian translation, Donizetti approached the famed librettist Felice Romani, who had written a successful libretto in 1830 for &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, the opera which secured the composer&#x27;s place as one of the leaders of his day. Wanting a strong and powerful subject for his new work, the composer&#x27;s idea was to have Romani prepare a libretto about Mary Stuart, but the librettist appears to have ignored him, perhaps because of his desire to get away from writing for the theatre, which he increasingly found to be distasteful.

Therefore, the composer sought the services of Giuseppe Bardari (1817–1861), a seventeen-year-old law student with no experience, who became the librettist, thus giving Donizetti the opportunity to work closely with him, or to even write entire scenes himself and to greatly influence the structure of the work. Schiller&#x27;s play had been translated into Italian by Andrea Maffei (who also translated a number of others as well) and it was this translation upon which Bardari relied. Although he was forced to eliminate &quot;almost all of the play&#x27;s political and religious references and (reduce) the number of characters from 21 to six, the libretto does adds the love story of Mary Stuart and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, which had no basis in fact, albeit that Leicester had been considered by Elizabeth to be a possible husband for Mary. At the time of the events portrayed, Dudley was actually 55, Elizabeth was 53 and Mary was 44.

However, the libretto does retain the fictional meeting between Mary and Elizabeth in a very dramatic confrontation. While its musical elements are noted below, &quot;the confrontation...so essential to the dramatic structure of both play and opera, it is, surely, a translation into action of a clash which was implicit in history – of a clash which took place in the letters the queens exchanged&quot;.

===&quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; becomes &quot;Buondelmonte&quot;===
An incident occurred at a rehearsal of the opera which is recounted by Harold Rosenthal:

:Ronzi De Begnis was to sing Queen Elizabeth (soprano) and Anna Del Serre the mezzo-soprano title-role. At one of the rehearsals an incident occurred [which Donizetti expert, William Ashbrook describes as &#x27;one of the famous scandals of the day&#x27;]. In the second act of the opera, Mary Stuart rounds on Queen Elizabeth with these words: 
:&quot;Figlia impura di Bolena, / parli tu di disonore? / Meretrice indegna e oscena, / in te cada il mio rossore. / Profanato è il soglio inglese, / vil bastarda, dal tuo piè!&quot; 
:At the rehearsal, Anna Del Serre declaimed these lines with such passion, that Ronzi Di Begnis took them as a personal insult and rushed at Del Serre, pulling her hair, punching her, biting her and hitting her on her face and breast. Del Serre returned in kind, but the soprano got the better of her rival, and Del Serre was carried fainting from the theatre.

The rehearsal continued, she sang, the matter went no further. After its successful dress rehearsal, the King of Naples suddenly banned performances of the opera &quot;perhaps because his Queen, Maria Christina, was a direct descendant of Mary Stuart&quot; or &quot;the sight of one queen calling another &#x27;vile bastard&#x27; on the stage of the Teatro San Carlo […] was too much for the Neapolitan sensibility&quot;. But it has also been simply noted by Professor Weatherson that &quot;politics were the cause&quot; in that reputed secret seditious behavior against Elizabeth I by Mary &quot;made the decapitated monarch unpopular in Bourbon Naples&quot;.

Donizetti responded to the ban by suggesting another subject, that being &quot;Giovanna Gray&quot; (&quot;Lady Jane Gray&quot;), but after it was also rejected, he set about revising and removing large segments of the score and, by quickly employing Pietro Salatino as new librettist, created a different work. He named it &quot;Buondelmonte&quot; referring to a character who appears in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot; &quot;who apparently caused a war between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines&quot;. But prior to its first performance, the composer expressed his concerns in a letter to librettist Jacopo Ferretti (as quoted by Ashbrook): 
:There used to be six characters in all? Now there are 10 or more. You can imagine what the opera has become! The same scenery, appropriate or not, will be used. I haven&#x27;t been able to bring myself to ask whether it works or not…

Inevitably perhaps, when &quot;Buondelmonte&quot; was first given on 18 October 1834 in Naples, it was not successful; it received only six performances and it was never performed again.

When forced to simplify part of the music for the original Elisabetta, Donizetti scribbled on the margin &quot;But it&#x27;s ugly!&quot;, and further on refused a change, writing &quot;Do it, and may you live for a hundred years!&quot;

==Performance history==
===&quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; appears in Italy: its 19th–century rise and fall===
Although there was an attempt to mount &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; at La Scala in late 1834, it came to nothing and, finally, the opera was planned to be given on 28 December 1835 at La Scala, Milan with the famous mezzo-soprano Maria Malibran (a singer who often sang soprano parts) in the title role. Donizetti &quot;tailored that role&quot; for her with &quot;improved recitatives, and extended scenes&quot;. In addition, he created a new overture. The censor had approved the libretto, although Ashbrook speculates that some of the original wording had been changed to gain that approval.

In the end, the opening night performance was postponed due to Malibran&#x27;s indisposition, but when it did occur on 30 December, it was clear that both lead role singers were in poor voice. Donizetti described the evening as &quot;painful, from start to finish&quot;. It was quickly clear that the audience disapproved, as did the authorities for different reasons because, instead of singing &quot;donna vile&quot; as the substitute language for &quot;vil bastarda&quot; (&quot;vile bastard&quot;), Malibran rejected the censor&#x27;s revisions and sang the original words. Several better-performed presentations later, the Milan censors clamped down, imposed conditions which Malibran would not accept, and she withdrew. Realizing the difficulties of a run in Italy, a London première was planned, but Malibran&#x27;s death at the age of 28 in 1836 cancelled the project.

Except for the several performances of the &quot;Buondelmonte&quot; version noted above, productions of &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; were staged in Reggio Emilia and Modena (1837), in Ferrara and Malta (1839–40), in Florence, Ancona, Venice and Madrid (1840), Bologna (1841), Porto (1842), Granada, Málaga, and Barcelona plus Venice and Padua (1843), Lisbon (1844), and finally Pesaro (1844–45), all variously trimmed versions. Naples finally heard the opera in 1865, but the work was ignored for the next 130 years. It has been suggested that, with the exception of Venice and Naples, most of these locations &quot;were of peripheral importance&quot; and therefore the opera &quot;never found its way to the stages of Vienna, Paris, or London&quot;, the Italian reception being a major requirement to launch an international success.

===Revivals in the 20th century and beyond===
Prior to the discovery of the original autograph in Sweden in the 1980s, the only performances which began the 20th century revival were those of what Ashbrook described as 19th Century &quot;sanitized&quot; versions. The first one of the century was that given in 1958 in Bergamo, with the US premiere, in concert form, following on 16 November 1964 in Carnegie Hall. The premiere in England took place on 1 March 1966 in London. There was also a Maggio Musicale Fiorentino production in 1967 which starred Leyla Gencer and Shirley Verrett.

By the late 1980s, after a critical edition was prepared from the autograph, what was revealed at that point was that Donizetti had re-used a couple of numbers in &quot;La favorite&quot;, and that in post-&quot;Favorite&quot; performances, starting with one in Naples in 1865, they had been replaced by different numbers from his other lesser-known operas. The critical edition was first given in Bergamo in 1989 in a two-act version.

The first staged performance in the US took place at the San Francisco Opera on 12 November 1971 with Joan Sutherland in the title role, while the first staged performances of the &quot;Three Queens&quot; operas together in the US took place in 1972 at the New York City Opera, all three operas staged by Tito Capobianco. Presentations of the trio earned some degree of fame for American soprano Beverly Sills who took the starring role in each. Dame Janet Baker sang the title role (in English translation) in a production at English National Opera conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras beginning in 1973, which was recorded and filmed.

The opera has been given in a variety of European and North American locations in recent times, which begin to increasingly establish it as part of the standard repertoire. A production which was noted as &quot;no longer a display piece for rival divas, nor does it maintain the simplistic view that the opera presents Mary as noble victim and Elizabeth as vengeful monster [but] here, the rival queens are both profoundly tragic, complex figures&quot;, was given by English Touring Opera in 2005 and &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; was presented at both the Teater Vanemuine in Estonia and Pacific Opera in Victoria, B.C. during the 2011/12 season. Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013, the opera has seen 86 performances of 18 productions in 16 cities, according to Operabase.

Other US companies have presented some or all of the &quot;Three Donizetti Queens&quot; operas. Among them has been the Dallas Opera with both &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; to date. The Minnesota Opera staged all three between 2009 and 2012. In April 2012, the Houston Grand Opera presented the Minnesota Opera&#x27;s production of the work, but casting mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato in the title role. (A mezzo singing the role is not uncommon today, as has been noted below.) She had sung the role of Elisabetta in Geneva in 2005 and, when the Metropolitan Opera gave &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; in January/February 2013, it also starred DiDonato as Maria. As with &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, which preceded it in 2011, this was the company&#x27;s first staging of the work.

Welsh National Opera presented all three of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Queens&quot; operas throughout the UK from September to November 2013. This historic season was premiered in Cardiff then toured to venues in England and Wales in 2013.

== Roles ==
===The casting of Maria and Elisabetta===

Originally the roles of Maria and Elisabetta were written for sopranos. However, given the precedent of Malibran singing the role of Maria, many modern-day productions, dating from the late 1950s onwards, cast a mezzo-soprano as either Maria or Elisabetta. The role of Maria was written for Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis, who sang the soprano roles of Donna Anna, in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and Norma but also the mezzo-soprano role of Rosina, in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;.

After the King of Naples banned the opera when it was in rehearsal, it became &quot;Buondelmonte&quot; with one or other of the queens (probably Elisabetta) turned into the tenor title-role and de Begnis singing a role called Bianca. Malibran (who sang Norma but also Leonore and Cenerentola and had a range of G3-E6) then decided that she wanted to sing Maria Stuarda, which she did until it was banned again. It was performed for a time subsequently in &quot;sanitised&quot; form and was eventually revived in 1958, still sanitised.

==Music==
As musicologist and Donizetti expert William Ashbrook notes, in many respects the musical structure of the opera is fairly straightforward and follows many of the conventions of the day. For example, Elisabeth, Mary, and Leicester &quot;are each given a &quot;double-aria&quot; (a cantabile followed by a cabaletta) at their first appearances and Mary is also given one at the opera&#x27;s end. However, the composer&#x27;s strength lies in being able to tailor the framework to &quot;a specific set of dramatic circumstances&quot;. Singled out is Maria&#x27;s &quot;Oh nube! che lieve per l&#x27;aria t&#x27;aggiri&quot; (&quot;Oh cloud, that wanders light upon the breeze&quot;) which appears in her entrance scene.

Therefore, adapting to many of the conventions of 19th Century Italian opera, which had become the tradition before he began composing, Donizetti&#x27;s work increasingly shows a shift to more dramatically complex musical forms, the aim of which is to enhance the often-dramatic confrontations between the characters in his operas. Ashbrook notes two of these conventions: the tradition of the soprano&#x27;s &quot;aria di sortita&quot; (given upon her first appearance onstage) and the typical, often florid, aria which becomes the opera&#x27;s finale. Therefore, in the case of the soprano&#x27;s entrance aria, Ashbrook observes:
:As if to counteract [these dramatic limitations], through much of his composing life Donizetti worked to expand the expressive potential of duets. The broad spectrum of dramatic situations possible for duets appealed to his strong theatrical sense, and they came to occupy an increasingly important place in his designs. It is consistent with the rising tide of Romanticism in Italian opera during the 1830s and the growing emphasis on melodramatic elements that new prominence should be placed upon duets, especially those of confrontation.

Examples occur in &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Maria Padilla&quot;, both of which precede this opera, but Ashbrook recognized at least two instances which evidence Donizetti&#x27;s distinctive musical genius in &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;. One is the Leicester-Elizabeth duet (beginning with Leicester&#x27;s &quot;Era d&#x27;amor l&#x27;immagine&quot; / &quot;She was the picture of love&quot;) which appears before Maria&#x27;s entrance and where Leicester pleads for Maria while Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;ironic interjections provide a contrast of rhythmic emphasis and melodic pattern to the tenor&#x27;s balanced lyric phrases&quot;.
Most significantly, the other is in the great dramatic scene (unusually long and elaborate tempo di mezzo, between the pezzo concertato and the stretta) at the end of act 1 (act 2 in some productions) – the confrontation between the two queens – which gives &quot;the climactic moment something of the immediacy of the spoken theatre. In any sense, this dialogue is one of the most original and powerful passages that Donizetti ever composed&quot; or, as another critic puts it, &quot;so that the outrageous text is heard in shocking relief.&quot;

In regard to the music of the ending of act 2, in the dramatic action it has been noted as fitting to the &quot;sparse, clearly-constructed action leading to an inescapable end. And since that end is the focus of all interest, it is not surprising that the final act is musically as well as dramatically the culmination of the work, growing out of but eclipsing all that has gone before&quot;.

With the delay between the cancelled performances in Naples and the premiere of &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; in Milan almost a year and a half later, Donizetti was to replace the prelude with a full overture and added a new version of a duet between Elizabeth and Leicester using previously written music.

== Synopsis ==
:Place: Palace of Westminster, London and Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, England.
:Time: The year 1587.

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: Elisabetta&#x27;s court at Westminster&quot;

The Lords and Ladies of the Court enter after a tournament to honor the French ambassador, who has brought a marriage proposal to Queen Elizabeth from the Dauphin François. They express their joy as Elizabeth enters. She considers the proposal, one which would create an alliance with France, but she is reluctant to give up her freedom and also pardon her cousin Mary Stuart, the former Queen of Scots, whom she has imprisoned because of various plots against her throne (Cavatina: &quot;Ahi! quando all&#x27;ara scórgemi&quot; / &quot;Ah! when at the altar a chaste love from heaven singles me out&quot;). Elizabeth expresses her uncertainty while at the same time, Talbot and the courtiers plead for Mary&#x27;s life (Cabaletta: &quot;Ah! dal Ciel discenda un raggio&quot; / &quot;Ah! may some ray descend from heaven&quot;).

Just as Elizabeth inquires where Leicester is, he enters and Elizabeth tells him to inform the French ambassador that she will indeed marry François. He betrays no signs of being jealous, and the Queen assumes that she has a rival.

Alone with Leicester, Talbot reveals to him that he has just returned from Fotheringay and gives a letter and a miniature portrait of Mary. Joyously, Leicester recalls his love for Mary (Aria of Leicester, then duet with Talbot: &quot;Ah! rimiro il bel sembiante&quot; / &quot;Ah! Again I see her beautiful face&quot;). Talbot asks what he intends to do and Leicester swears to try to free her from her imprisonment (&quot;Vuò liberarla! Vuò liberarla!&quot; / &quot;I want to set her free&quot;).

Talbot leaves and, as Leicester is about to do so, Elizabeth enters. Clearly knowing what has gone on between the two men, she questions him, asks about a letter from Mary, and then demands to see it. Reluctantly, Leicester hands it over, noting that Mary has asked for a meeting with her cousin and he pleads with the Queen to agree to do so. Also, upon her questioning, he confesses his love for Mary (Duet of Leicester and Elizabeth: &quot;Era d&#x27;amor l&#x27;immagine&quot; / &quot;She was the picture of love&quot;). Told that Elizabeth can join a hunting party on the estates where Mary is imprisoned, she agrees to the meeting, albeit with revenge on her mind (Cabaletta to the duet: &quot;Sul crin la rivale la man mi stendea&quot; / &quot;Over my head my rival stretched out her hand&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2: Fotheringay Castle&quot; 
:[In many modern performances this scene is called Act 2, with the final act becoming Act 3. Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook in Grove Dictionary notes that the opera is &quot;in two or three acts&quot;.]

Mary reflects on her youth in France with her companion, Anna (Cavatina: &quot;Oh nube! che lieve per l&#x27;aria ti aggiri&quot; / &quot;Oh cloud! that wanders light upon the breeze&quot;). The sounds of a royal hunt are heard and, hearing the hunters cry out that the Queen is close by, Mary expresses her disgust (Cabaletta: &quot;Nella pace del mesto reposo&quot; / &quot;In the peace of my sad seclusion, she would afflict me with a new terror&quot;). To her surprise, Leicester approaches and warns Mary of Elizabeth&#x27;s imminent arrival, counseling her to behave humbly towards the Queen, who is then despondent (Duet: &quot;Da tutti abbandonata&quot; / &quot;Forsaken by everyone… my heart knows no hope&quot;). But assuring Mary that he will do whatever is necessary to obtain her freedom, Leicester leaves her to meet Elizabeth. He then attempts to plead with the Queen for her forbearance.

When Mary is brought in by Talbot, Elizabeth reacts with hostility (&quot;È sempre la stessa: superba, orgogliosa&quot; / She is always the same, proud, overbearing&quot;) and, after each character collectively expresses his or her feelings, Mary approaches and kneels before the Queen (Aria: &quot;Morta al mondo, ah! morta al trono&quot; / &quot;Dead to the world, and dead to the throne… I come to beg your pardon&quot;). The confrontation soon becomes hostile. Elizabeth accuses Mary of having murdered her husband, Lord Darnley, as well as acts of treason and debauchery, all the while Leicester attempting to calm both sides. Stung by Elizabeth&#x27;s false accusations, Mary calls her the &quot;Figlia impura di Bolena&quot; (&quot;Impure daughter of Boleyn&quot;) and continues with the final insult: &quot;Profanato è il soglio inglese, vil bastarda, dal tuo piè!&quot; (&quot;The English throne is sullied, vile bastard, by your foot&quot;). Elizabeth is horrified and demands that the guards take Mary away, declaring &quot;The axe that awaits you will show my revenge&quot;. Mary is returned to captivity.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: A room in Elisabetta&#x27;s apartments&quot;

Cecil enters with the death warrant and attempts to persuade her to sign it. While she hesitates, Elizabeth contemplates the situation (Aria: &quot;Quella vita a me funesta&quot; / &quot;That life, so threatening to me&quot;). Cecil urges her to sign it &quot;so that every ruler will know how to pardon you for it&quot; and, as she is about to do so, Leicester arrives. Seeing him, Elizabeth exclaims &quot;you are hastening the execution&quot; and signs the death warrant. Leicester pleads for mercy, Elizabeth rejects the plea, and Cecil urges her to remain firm (Trio &quot;Deh! per pietà sospendi l&#x27;estremo colpo almeno&quot; / &quot;Alas! For pity&#x27;s sake spare the final blow at least&quot;). The confrontation ends with Elizabeth holding firm despite Leicester&#x27;s accusations of cruelty; she orders him to witness Mary&#x27;s execution.

&quot;Scene 2: Maria&#x27;s room&quot;

Mary contemplates her fate, and that of Leicester also: &quot;I have brought misfortune to all&quot;. Talbot and Cecil enter and Cecil tells Mary that he holds her death warrant. After Cecil leaves the room, Talbot informs her that Leicester has been ordered to witness her execution. Beside herself with grief, Mary imagines that the ghost of Lord Darnley is in the room with her, while Talbot offers comfort (Duet: &quot;Quando di luce rosea il giorno a me splendea&quot; / &quot;While with the light of dawn my life still sparkled&quot;). However, Talbot then presses her about &quot;one more sin&quot;: her &quot;unity with&quot; (&quot;uniti eri&quot;) Babington, to which she initially responds &quot;Ah! be silent; it was a fatal error&quot;, but, when he insists, adds that &quot;dying my heart affirms it.&quot;

&quot;Scene 3: The courtyard at Fotheringay&quot;

People gather at the site of the execution, lamenting that a queen&#x27;s death will bring shame upon England. Mary enters and says her farewells to the crowd, which includes Talbot, telling them she will be going to a better life. She calls them to a final prayer (Mary, with Chorus: &quot;Deh! Tu di un úmile preghiera il suono odi&quot; / &quot;Ah! May Thou hear the sound of our humble prayer&quot;) and, together, she and the crowd pray for God&#x27;s mercy. When Cecil arrives to tell her that the time for her execution has come, he informs her that Elizabeth has granted her final wishes, including allowing Anna to accompany her to the scaffold. Then Mary offers a pardon to the queen (Mary, Anna, Talbot, Cecil, chorus: &quot;Di un cor che more reca il perdóno&quot; / &quot;From a heart that is dying, may pardon be granted&quot;). Leicester comes to bid her farewell. Both are distraught and he expresses outrage. Mary asks him to support her at the hour of her death and protests her innocence once again (Aria: &quot;Ah! se un giorno da queste ritorte&quot; / &quot;Ah! Though one day from this prison your arm wanted to abduct me, now you lead me to my death&quot;). She is then led to the scaffold.

<text>John Steuart Curry (November 14, 1897 – August 29, 1946) was an American painter whose career spanned the years from 1924 until his death. He was noted for his paintings depicting rural life in his home state, Kansas. Along with Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, he was hailed as one of the three great painters of American Regionalism of the first half of the twentieth century. Curry&#x27;s artistic production was varied, including paintings, book illustrations, prints, and posters.

Curry was Kansas&#x27;s best-known painter, but his works were not popular with Kansans, who felt that he did not portray the state positively. Curry&#x27;s paintings often depicted farm life and animals, tornadoes, prairie fires, and the violent Bleeding Kansas period (featuring abolitionist John Brown, who at the time was derided as a fanatical traitor) – subjects that Kansans did not want to be representative of the state. Curry was commissioned to create murals for the Kansas State Capitol, and he completed two: &quot;Kansas Pastoral&quot;, and his most famous and controversial work, &quot;Tragic Prelude,&quot; which he considered his greatest. Reaction was so negative that the Kansas Legislature passed a measure to keep them, or future works of his, from being hung on the capitol walls. As a result, Curry did not sign the works, which were not hung during his lifetime. He left Topeka in disgust; his planned eight smaller murals for the Capitol rotunda on the first floor never went beyond sketches, now held by the Kansas Museum of History.

Curry&#x27;s works were painted with movement, which was conveyed by the free brush work and energized forms that characterized his style. His control over brushstrokes created excited emotions such as fear and despair in his paintings. His fellow Regionalists, who also painted action and movement, influenced Curry&#x27;s style.

==Biography==
Curry was born on a farm in Dunavant, Kansas, November 14, 1897; the house has been moved to Oskaloosa and there are plans to make a museum of it. He was the eldest of five children to parents Thomas Smith Curry and Margaret Steuart Curry. Despite living on a Midwestern farm, both of Curry&#x27;s parents were college educated and had even visited Europe for their honeymoon. Curry&#x27;s early life consisted of caring for the animals on the farm, attending the nearby high school and excelling in athletics. His childhood home was filled with many reproductions of Peter Paul Rubens and Gustave Doré, and these artists&#x27; styles played a significant role in crafting Curry&#x27;s own style.

His family was very religious, as were most people in Dunavant. Curry was encouraged to paint animals around the farm, and at the age of twelve he had his first art lesson. In 1916 he entered the Kansas City Art Institute, but after only a month there he transferred to the Art Institute of Chicago, where he stayed for two years. In 1918 he attended Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. After he graduated, Curry worked as an illustrator from 1921 to 1926. He worked for several magazines, including &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Country Gentleman&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

In 1926, Curry spent a year in Paris studying the works of Gustave Courbet and Honoré Daumier, as well as the color techniques of Titian and Rubens. After his return to the United States he settled in New York City and married Clara Derrick; shortly thereafter, they moved to an artists&#x27; colony in Westport, Connecticut. Clara died in June 1932 and for the next two years Curry devoted his time to working in his studio. He traveled briefly with the Ringling Brothers Circus and during his time with them created his painting &quot;The Flying Cadonas&quot;. He remarried in 1934 to Kathleen Gould.

In 1936, Curry was appointed as the first artist-in-residence at the College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin, which built him a small studio. He had no classes to teach nor any specific duties; he was free to travel throughout the state and promote art in farming communities by providing personal instruction to students. As seen later, the experience turned Curry into a conservationist, especially concerned with Kansas&#x27;s man-made ecological disaster, the plowing that produced horrible erosion in Kansas, along with Dust Bowl storms.

The same year he was commissioned to paint a mural for the Department of Justice Building and Main Interior Building in Washington. In 1937 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Member, and became a full Academician in 1943. This was followed with what might have been the crown of his career, a commission to paint murals on Kansas topics for the Kansas State Capitol at Topeka, on which abortive project see below.

Curry continued to work at the University of Wisconsin until he died of a heart attack in Madison in 1946, at the age of 48.

==Curry and regionalistic art==
Curry was one of the three great painters of American regionalistic art; the others were Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. All three were from the Midwest, west of the Mississippi: Wood from Iowa, Benton from Missouri, and Curry from Kansas. Their art presents a nostalgic look at rural life in the American heartland. Regionalism was essentially a revolt against at least one major evil of the Industrial Revolution: centralization.

Centralization of manufacturing permitted mass production, with efficient factories and assembly-line production. This reduced the cost of manufactured goods, but at the expense of regional or local variety and initiative. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression demonstrated the limitations and failures of capitalism. Rugged depictions of regional, independent life in wide-open spaces provided an alternative. As put by Meyer Schapiro, &quot;Regionalism obscured the crucial forces of history, as defined by Marx, and provided entertaining distractions from the realities facing oppressed people.&quot;

In contrast with Wood, who lived in Iowa, and Benton in Missouri, Curry did not live in Kansas as an adult. As seen by Curry, nostalgia for rural Kansan life ignored its shortcomings: tornados, prairie fires, dust storms, plagues of insects, and life-threatening floods. The depiction of the same in his paintings had as consequence the reservations some Kansans felt about seeing him, without qualification, as Kansas&#x27;s great painter. In fact, as he well knew, his works did not sell in Kansas.

The University of Wisconsin hired him in 1936 as artist-in-residence, something no Kansas university would do. At Wisconsin, based in the College of Agriculture, Curry became a conservationist. What some Kansans found particularly offensive was his stated plan to portray the tragedy of soil erosion in one of his planned murals for the Kansas Capitol, providing a &quot;significant warning&quot; to Kansas farmers that they had brought on an ecological disaster. He was surprised when these plans met with local resentment.

==Curry and Wisconsin==

Curry was thought of in his day as the great Kansas painter, and it was no secret that he wanted to paint murals for Kansas; he confirmed this to a reporter. However, his relationship with Kansas was complicated. He lived in Connecticut and declined repeated suggestions that he move back to his home state; instead, he moved to Wisconsin when its University offered him in 1936 what no Kansas institution would: a position as artist-in-residence. He remained there until his death in 1946. While at Wisconsin he completed in 1942 a by mural on the Emancipation Proclamation, titled &quot;Freeing of the Slaves&quot;. It was originally intended, in 1936, for the new U.S. Department of Justice Building, but sketches were rejected by federal officials, who told Curry that they feared that “serious difficulties...might arise as a result of the racial implications of the subject matter.” Curry painted two other murals in that building, &quot;Movement of the Population Westward&quot; and &quot;Law versus Mob Rule&quot;. However, the design caught the attention of Wisconsin Law School dean Lloyd K. Garrison, great-grandson of the famous abolitionist Wm. Lloyd Garrison, who had it installed in the Reading Room of the new Law School library.

==Curry and Kansas==
In his many Kansas-themed works, he wanted to present a &quot;personal view&quot; of Kansas history. &quot;I want to picture what I feel about my native state.&quot; In preparation for the crowning project of his career, the Kansas Capitol murals, he spent several days in the Kansas Historical Society and the Topeka Public Library studying Kansas history. As he put it, he wanted to &quot;wreak good&quot; upon Kansas.

Curry painted Kansas as he saw it, warts and all. His planned pieces for the first-floor rotunda of the Kansas Capitol, which never got beyond preliminary sketches, included one on conservation and erosion. Curry expressed the view of the professors in the College of Agriculture, that Kansas farmers&#x27; poor soil management caused the erosion and dust storms of 1930s Kansas.

This displeased many Kansans, who did not want soil erosion, or the alleged errors of Kansas farmers, in their Capitol. Furthermore, John Brown was a convicted traitor, and in the opinion of many, a kook. The opposition grew so bitter that Curry abandoned his great Kansas Capitol project in disgust. He refused to sign the two works completed or allow them to be hung, as he said they were intended to be seen as part of a group. They were hung in the Capitol after his death.

===&quot;Baptism in Kansas&quot;===

In August 1928, Curry painted &quot;Baptism in Kansas&quot;, which was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and met with almost instant success. The painting was praised in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and earned Curry the attention of Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. In 1931 Mrs. Vanderbilt Whitney purchased the painting for the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, thus establishing him as a major artist.

&quot;Baptism in Kansas&quot; reflected the religious sects that held open-air baptisms. These popular religious groups were part of the scene of rural life that Curry saw in Kansas. He presents the scene with reverence.

No well-known Baptismal representations by old world masters employ the unique compositional layout that Curry favors. Curry&#x27;s painting was a shock to Easterners who would have never associated a baptism with full immersion or with a barnyard setting, but Curry painted what he was familiar with, as Lawrence Shmeckebrier said he &quot;saw this scene as conceived and executed with sincere reverence and understanding of one who had lived it.&quot; Curry&#x27;s religious painting is therefore an observance rather than a satire on religious fundamentalism.

===&quot;Tornado over Kansas&quot;===

Under Mrs. Whitney&#x27;s patronage Curry painted &quot;Tornado over Kansas&quot;, which depicts a farmer facing an approaching tornado while he and his wife help the family and animals into the tornado shelter. The painting was unveiled in 1929 just before the Wall Street Crash in October and provided those in the city with the romance of man versus nature themes. Typical of Curry&#x27;s work of the 1930s, he depicted scenes of labor, family, and land, in order to demonstrate peace, struggle, and perseverance that he had come to believe was the essence of American life, the spirit of Kansas.

===&quot;Kansas Pastoral&quot;===
&quot;Kansas Pastoral&quot; is the first of two murals completed for the Kansas Capitol. It presents a fictional agrarian utopia. The farmer is at leisure; the farm, its crops, and its animals are marvels of order, and seem to run themselves. The manual labor of the farm woman is no longer needed, and she can devote herself to the home.

===&quot;Tragic Prelude&quot;===
&quot;Tragic Prelude&quot; presents a visual history of Kansas: the first Europeans, Juan de Padilla and Coronado, followed by a plainsman hunting buffalos, and finally the Bleeding Kansas period of 1854–1861. During this period, when Kansas was the focus of national attention like no time before or since, &quot;old&quot; John Brown, believing he was doing the Lord&#x27;s work, and well-armed, led anti-slavery settlers in resisting, with violence if unfortunately necessary, the attempts to make Kansas a slave state. Kansas&#x27; status was not resolved until the beginning of the Civil War, when six slave states had seceded, and it could come into the Union as a free state.

Brown&#x27;s role during the Bleeding Kansas period—he was also an Underground Railroad conductor—was not widely remembered outside of Kansas. However, his name was familiar to anyone who had had a course in American history, as he was widely believed to have helped cause the Civil War, and on purpose, with his raid on the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia). He was quickly convicted of treason against the state of Virginia, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection, and hung. &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; was the marching song of Union soldiers.

&quot;Tragic Prelude&quot; puts Brown in front of the troops killing each other. In the background, approaching tornado and prairie fires suggest the calamity, the Civil War, that was fast approaching, and that Brown seemed to be calling for.

The painting produced a negative reaction in advance of its being hung. (It was not hung until after Curry&#x27;s death.) John Brown, convicted of treason against the state of Virginia, was not someone most Kansans felt proud of, nor was the Bleeding Kansas period as a whole. Adding to public consternation was Curry&#x27;s plan to portray ruinous soil erosion, in Kansas a very controversial and political topic, in another mural. The Legislature could not fire Curry since he was being paid out of funds newspaper editors raised from the public. However, they withdrew permission for Curry&#x27;s works to be hung in the Capitol.

This was devastating to Curry. He left Kansas in disgust and refused to sign the two murals he did complete, saying that they could not be understood in isolation.

Over time, &quot;Tragic Prelude&quot; has become by far Curry&#x27;s most famous work. It is the only work of Curry&#x27;s to have a book devoted solely to it, and is also well-known as the source material for the album cover of rock band Kansas&#x27; 1974 debut record.

==Political art==
Curry&#x27;s art, in general, was conservative in political content. He believed that art was for the common person. He did not believe in political propaganda, particularly the Marxist kind that Diego Rivera popularized in the 1930s. Curry avoided exploiting the controversial subjects in which Rivera became involved because he did not believe they added any artistic quality to his work. However, Curry did create a few political sketches or studies, but these were never expanded on for larger projects. Rather, he enjoyed observing public events and capturing them on paper.

Curry&#x27;s few semi-political paintings evolved out of his personal experiences rather than created as a display of social commentary. &quot;The Return of Private Davis,&quot; completed in 1940, was first witnessed near his home in 1918, and a similar study was made in France during 1926. Schmeckebier relates this painting to the ceremony of baptism: &quot;a rural religious ceremony whose tragedy is intensified by the realization that this son of the fresh green Kansas prairies was sacrificed on a battlefield whose ideological remoteness was as dramatic as its geographical makeup.&quot; The painting does not express a political spectacle, rather Curry&#x27;s personal feelings. Conversely, &quot;Parade to War&quot; depicts departing soldiers rather than the return of a victim of war.

Along with war scenes, Curry also produced manhunt and fugitive subjects. These ideas were inspired by remembrances from his own childhood, but were also observed from publicized events during the early 1930s. The Lindbergh kidnapping and John Dillinger&#x27;s crime spree were well known and public deaths such as lynchings were often the result of such crimes. In addition, the plight of black male victims of lynching became a focus of attention. Curry&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Fugitive,&quot; showing a black man hiding from a mob, appeared in a 1935 exhibition, &quot;An Art Commentary on Lynching,&quot; organized in support of national anti-lynching legislation (which never passed; anti-lynching legislation was only passed at the federal level in 2022). These earlier political works would influence later Curry&#x27;s mural work in the Department of Justice Building. Located &quot;above the entrance to the Justice Department library&quot; is Curry&#x27;s painting, &quot;Law vs. Mob Rule&quot; in which a judge in black robes protects a man who has collapsed on the courthouse steps from a lynch mob.

==Reactions and legacy==
Despite popularity in the rest of the country, Curry&#x27;s works did not find favor in Kansas. He was taken as ridiculing the worst aspects of the state. Kansans felt the inclusion of outdoor baptisms and tornadoes perpetuated negative stereotypes about the state. When these paintings were displayed in New York galleries many Kansans felt belittled. However, the New York public was fascinated by Curry&#x27;s paintings. Curry&#x27;s paintings were entertaining and easy to grasp, and allowed viewers to see a more primitive, isolated, non-commercial version of America.

In 1992, the Kansas Legislature apologized for its treatment of Curry and purchased the drawings related to his murals.

<doc id="552214" wikidata="Q917040" url="?curid=552214" title="Devil's Peak (Cape Town)">
<text>Devil&#x27;s Peak is part of the mountainous backdrop to Cape Town, South Africa. When looking at Table Mountain from the city centre, or when looking towards the city across Table Bay, the skyline from left to right consists of Devil&#x27;s Peak, the flat summit of Table Mountain, the peak of Lion&#x27;s Head, and Signal Hill.

The central districts of Cape Town are located within this natural amphitheatre. The city grew out of a settlement founded on the shore below the mountains in 1652 by Jan van Riebeeck, for the Dutch East India Company. Some of the first farms in the Cape were established on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak, along the Liesbeek River.

Devil&#x27;s Peak stands high, less than Table Mountain&#x27;s , and there are a number of hiking routes to the summit.

== Landmarks ==

The Rhodes Memorial to Cecil Rhodes, and the University of Cape Town are situated on the eastern slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak. Other landmarks on the eastern slopes are Mostert&#x27;s Mill, Groote Schuur Hospital, and the Groote Schuur estate, including a number of presidential and ministerial residences.
A number of historic military blockhouses are situated on Devil&#x27;s Peak, along with a number of cannons intended to defend the city from attack from the south. There is an abandoned fire lookout high up on Mowbray Ridge.

==Hiking==
There are a lot of easy walks on the lower slopes of the mountain. A popular short hike is from Rhodes Memorial to the King&#x27;s blockhouse. The only generally accessible ascent of the peak is from the Saddle, between the peak and Table Mountain. There are three routes to reach the Saddle: from Tafelberg Road on the city side, up Newlands Ravine from Newlands Forest, or the upper contour path from Mowbray Ridge and Minor Peak. Once on the Saddle, a straightforward path climbs directly to the summit, which has a 360° view of Cape Town and Table Mountain. A number of the gorges on the West side of the mountain are steep, wet and dangerous, particularly Second Waterfall Ravine, Dark Gorge and Els Ravine.

==Vegetation==

The northern slopes overlooking the city centre are covered in typical Cape Peninsula Shale Fynbos. These slopes are hotter and prone to frequent fires, and as a result the vegetation is low. Here can also be found a small stretch of critically endangered Peninsula Shale Renosterveld vegetation, an endemic vegetation type that used to dominate the Cape Town City Bowl but is now mostly lost due to urban development.
The slopes on the Southern Suburbs side however, are naturally wetter and more protected from fires, so these slopes were originally partially covered with deep indigenous forests. Some of these dense afro-montane forests still remain in the gorges, but most of them were cut down to make way for commercial pine plantations. Near Rhodes Memorial there are a stands of the native silver tree, one of the few remaining areas where the tree still grows wild.

During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, Devil&#x27;s Peak (and other adjacent heights) were commercially planted with plantations of cluster pines, a problematic invasive non-indigenous tree. More recently, local authorities and volunteers felled the pines from the higher slopes while maintaining pine and gum plantations in Newlands Forest on the lower reaches of the mountain for recreational purposes. The original indigenous Afro-montane forest is also slowly re-growing on the southern slopes and above Newlands forest where the pines have been cleared, with programmes to remove pines and other alien vegetation continuing. Stone pines (a non-invasive alien tree) still remain in the area around Rhodes Memorial.

== Fauna ==

Indigenous animals include porcupines, caracals, small grey mongoose, rock hyraxes (also known as dassies), and many species of bird. Near Rhodes Memorial, some of the lower slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak were artificially maintained as savanna, with eland, wildebeest and zebra kept there, with the zebras forming part of the Quagga Project. These animals were removed from the enclosure in early 2018 due to the uncertain water supply during the Cape Town water crisis.

In the 1930s, a few Himalayan tahrs (wild goats) escaped from a zoo on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak and bred until their population on the Table Mountain range was over 700. A culling programme has eliminated most of them, although a few still remain. Some of the original local species of small antelope are being re-introduced to replace the tahrs. Fallow deer were once kept in the area of Rhodes Memorial, but were removed starting in 2006.

== Geology ==
The upper, rocky parts of Devil&#x27;s Peak, Table Mountain and Lion&#x27;s Head consist of a hard, uniform and resistant sandstone commonly known as the Table Mountain sandstone or TMS. (This is, however, no longer used as a formal geological name). The tough sandstone rests conformably upon a basal shale that in turn lies unconformably upon a basement of older (Late Precambrian) rocks (Malmesbury shale/slate and the Cape Granite). The basal shale and the older rocks below it weather much faster than the TMS and for this reason the lower slopes are smoother in all parts, with few outcrops and deeper soil. Millions of years of erosion have stripped all of the TMS from Signal Hill and that is why it looks very rounded compared to its sister peaks. There is a road that runs almost on the contour from the lower cable station on Table Mountain along the mountain to Devil&#x27;s Peak. As it turns east around the bulk of Devil&#x27;s Peak the road cuttings expose a few famous geological unconformities, which illustrate very clearly that the Malmesbury rocks were folded, baked, intruded by granite and planed down by millions of years of erosion before the area sank below the ocean and a new sequence of sediments, including the TMS, began to accumulate.

== Origins of the name ==

Devil&#x27;s Peak was originally known as Windberg or Charles Mountain. The English term Devil&#x27;s Peak is a 19th-century translation from the Dutch &quot;Duivels Kop&quot;, and supposedly comes from the folk-tale about a Dutch man called Jan van Hunks, a prodigious pipe smoker who lived at the foot of the mountain circa 1700. He was forced by his wife to leave the house whenever he smoked his pipe. One day, while smoking on the slopes of the peak, he met a mysterious stranger who also smoked. They each bragged of how much they smoked and so they fell into a pipe-smoking contest. The stranger turned out to be the devil and Van Hunks eventually won the contest, but not before the smoke that they had made had covered the mountain, forming the table cloth cloud. The story was captured by the 19th century poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti in his poem &quot;Jan van Hunks&quot; (alternatively called &quot;The Dutchman&#x27;s Wager&quot;).
However, since Rossetti&#x27;s poem was only published in 1909, it&#x27;s unlikely that this was the true source of the name, rather an urban legend.

It has been claimed that the name is a corruption of &quot;Duifespiek&quot; (&quot;Dove&#x27;s Peak&quot;) to &quot;Duivelspiek&quot; (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Peak&quot;), since the Dutch words for devil and dove are relatively close in sound. The Dutch word &quot;Duivelspiek&quot; has been the common Afrikaans language name for the mountain and the suburb on the east side of the city bowl. The name may have been derived from the mountain&#x27;s &#x27;three pronged&#x27; spear shape, which is reminiscent of the spear held by the Devil in many images.

Another explanation is provided by Devil&#x27;s Peak Brewery. Forty years before Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape in 1497, the Venetian cartographer Fra Mauro created a map of the world for King Alfonso V of Portugal, based on knowledge drawn from the Arabians. On this map, which became the definitive view of the world for the early Portuguese explorers, he named the southernmost tip of Africa Cabo de Diab – the Devil&#x27;s Cape. It is possible the association with the devil migrated from there to the mountain.

==1971 plane crash==

On 26 May 1971, three South African Air Force Hawker-Siddeley HS125 (Code named Mercurius) aircraft crashed into Devil&#x27;s Peak, killing all 11 on board. The aircraft were flying in close formation, practicing for a fly-past during the upcoming 10th-anniversary Republic Day celebrations on 31 May. The aircraft, flying by sight along the N2 highway, banked to the right three seconds too late, crashing into the side of the mountain not far above Rhodes Memorial and the University of Cape Town. A low cloud base was cited as a contributory factor. The impact was heard throughout the surrounding suburbs. For many years a radar reflector beacon stood on Plumpudding Hill above Rhodes Memorial to prevent similar incidents.

<doc id="552216" wikidata="Q1430863" url="?curid=552216" title="Strafing">
<text>Strafing is the military practice of attacking ground targets from low-flying aircraft using aircraft-mounted automatic weapons. 
Less commonly, the term is used by extension to describe high-speed firing runs by any land or naval craft such as fast boats, using smaller-caliber weapons and targeting stationary or slowly-moving targets.

== Etymology ==
The word is an adaptation of German &quot;strafen&quot; (), to punish, specifically from the humorous adaptation of the German anti-British slogan &quot;Gott strafe England&quot; (May God punish England), dating back to World War I.

==Description==

Guns used in strafing range in caliber from machine guns, to autocannon or rotary cannon. Although ground attack using automatic weapons fire is very often accompanied with bombing or rocket fire, the term &quot;strafing&quot; does not specifically include the last two. 

The term &quot;strafing&quot; can cover either fixed guns, or aimable (flexible) guns. Fixed guns firing directly ahead tend to be more predominant on fixed wing aircraft, while helicopters tend to use gimballed weapons which can be fired in many different directions independent of the direction the aircraft is pointing in (in most cases, flexible guns on a fixed wing aircraft are for defense purposes only, although they can sometimes be used to fire on ground targets to limited effect). 
Some fixed wing aircraft, like fighter-bombers, are capable of flying either air-combat missions or ground attack missions (P-47 Thunderbolt), while others are dedicated ground-attack types (Il-2 Sturmovik). In cases where an aircraft is capable of both types of combat, when it is assigned to a ground attack role, and thus expected to be using the guns mostly for strafing, the fixed weapons are often mounted so that the convergence point is lower and at a greater range than would be used for air combat. This is helpful because it allows the pilot to aim at a target without having to dive towards the ground as steeply, decreasing the risk of collision with the ground and increasing the amount of firing time available before having to pull up, and it also increases the range from the target, helping avoid anti-aircraft fire and potential damage from exploding targets. Consequently, several types of aircraft-mounted gun pods like the Soviet SPPU-22 allowed for a mechanical depression of their barrels.
Because of the low altitude and relatively low airspeed required for accurate strafing, it is very risky for the pilot, who is exposed not only to the risk of flight-into-terrain and obstacles such as power lines, but also to anti-aircraft weapons, including surface-to-air missiles (both vehicle mounted and hand-held), anti-aircraft artillery and small caliber weapons fire (such as machine guns and small arms). Planes purposely designed for ground attack may include additional armour around and underneath the cockpit and other vulnerable areas such as engines to protect the pilot and key flight components, while aircraft designed mostly for air combat tend to have most of their armor placed to protect directly ahead or to the rear, where fire from other aircraft is most likely, leaving them more vulnerable to fire from directly below or to the sides, where much ground fire often comes from.

== History ==

===World War I===

While the earliest use of military aircraft was for observation and directing of artillery, strafing was frequently practised in World War I. Trenches and supply columns were routinely attacked from the air in the second half of the war. Strafing with machine guns was used when precision was needed (facing small targets), but non-strafing attack methods (primarily small bombs) were preferred for larger targets, area targets, or when low-altitude flying was too risky.

The German army was the first to introduce a class of aircraft specially designed for strafing, the ground-attack aircraft. Planes built specifically for strafing include the German World War I Junkers J.I, which was armored to protect it from ground-based gunfire. The Junkers J.I. had two downward-facing machine guns that were used for strafing.

===World War II===
These developments continued through World War II with dedicated aircraft including the concept of the heavily protected cockpit or &quot;bathtub&quot; to permit the pilot to survive counterfire from anti-aircraft batteries.
The Luftwaffe&#x27;s best strafing plane was the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. The Ju 87 G variant had two Rheinmetall-Borsig Flak 18 guns each mounted under the wing.

For the RAF, the best ground attack plane was the Hawker Hurricane II. It was armed with four wing-mounted cannon. The Hawker Typhoon and its derivative Hawker Tempest were used in the later stages of the war. They also had four cannons, while also being able to carry up to 8 &quot;60 lb&quot; RP-3 rockets.
For the US, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was one of the key ground attack planes. It was armed with eight .50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine guns. Another aircraft that was important in that role was the North American B-25 Mitchell. It was used for low-altitude strafing runs in the Pacific War.

The Russian Ilyushin IL-2 Sturmovik was one of the key Russian ground attack planes. It had heavy armour around the engine, underside and canopy. It was armed with cannon, depending on the model.

An RCAF Spitfire of 412 Squadron piloted by Charley Fox strafed the command car of Erwin Rommel on 17 July 1944 near Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery, affecting his possible participation in the 20 July 1944 Operation Valkyrie coup.

===Postwar===
In the Korean War (1950–1953), US Air Force planes strafed targets deep behind the front line and had a perceptible impact on the progress of the ground war, but the concept of strafing was already in decline.

In the 1960s, when precision-guided weapons became widespread, strafing temporarily fell out of favor as unnecessarily risky and some American fighter aircraft or attack aircraft (such as the F-4 Phantom II and A-6 Intruder) then did not have built-in cannon or machine guns. In the Vietnam War, that was found to be a deficiency, and improvised &quot;gunships&quot; had to be used in strafing missions. Gunships like the AC-47 Spooky, AC-119 Specter, and early models of the AC-130 Spooky gunship proved to be devastating defenders of besieged US Special Forces camps.

The A-10 Thunderbolt II is an American twin-engine, straight-wing jet aircraft developed by Fairchild-Republic in the early 1970s which is the only United States Air Force aircraft designed solely for close air support of ground forces. The A-10 was built to attack tanks, armored vehicles, and other ground targets with limited air defenses, often through strafing.

The A-10 was designed around the GAU-8 Avenger, a rotary cannon, which is the airplane&#x27;s primary armament and the heaviest such automatic cannon mounted on an aircraft. The A-10&#x27;s airframe was designed for survivability, with measures such as of armor for protection of the cockpit and aircraft systems that enables the aircraft to continue flying after taking significant damage. The A-10&#x27;s official name comes from the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt of World War II, a fighter that was particularly effective at close air support. The A-10 is the main US plane designed to do strafing runs.

Since 2001, Coalition pilots in Iraq and Afghanistan have used strafing runs to support ground forces in areas where explosive ordnance could cause unacceptable civilian casualties. Strafing runs done by F-16s are very risky for the pilot. The cities of Damascus and Aleppo were strafed by helicopter gunships in the Syrian civil war.

In 2004, the United States Air Force accidentally strafed one of its own country&#x27;s middle schools while training in the strafing of the Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School incident.

<doc id="552228" wikidata="Q3286541" url="?curid=552228" title="Mansfield, Victoria">
<text>Mansfield is a town in the foothills of the Victorian Alps in the Australian state of Victoria. It is approximately north-east of Melbourne by road. The population of Mansfield was at the 2021 census.

Mansfield is the seat of the Mansfield local government area. Mansfield was formerly heavily dependent on farming and logging but is now a tourist centre. It is the support town for the large Australia ski resort Mount Buller. It is associated with the high-country tradition of alpine grazing, celebrated in the film made around Mansfield, near the now famous Craigs Hut, called &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (based on a poem by Banjo Paterson).

==History==

The traditional owners of the Mansfield region are the Yowengillum clan of the Taungurung people. They also inhabited Alexandra and the Upper Goulburn River.

British colonisers began to enter the region in 1839 when Andrew Ewing (sometimes referred to as Andrew Ewan), a stockman representing the Scottish livestock company Watson &amp; Hunter, scouted the area for a new sheep station. Ewing encountered Yowengillum people along a waterway he named Devils River, as he considered these people to be &quot;black devils&quot;. The best land was to be found east of this river, adjacent to Mount Battery (known as Bayerlite to the Yowengillum), and Ewing established the Mount Battery sheep station there in 1840. The overseer&#x27;s hut was built near where the town of Mansfield now stands. Aboriginal encampments were also located near Mount Battery and were noted for their large stone ovens. Bitteruc, a Yowengillum elder at this time, stated that the land around Bayerlite was &quot;good country, my country.&quot;

Mansfield, originally known as Mount Battery, became a township that was surveyed in 1851 and named after Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, England. Settlement came after the discovery of gold nearby and the Post Office opened on 1 January 1858.

On the 11 November 1863, a triple hanging occurred in Melbourne Gaol; Elizabeth Scott, along with Julian Cross and David Gedge, were executed for the murder of Elizabeth&#x27;s husband in the Wappan district (near Mansfield).

Mansfield is famous as part of the Ned Kelly Trail. Significant memorials include the Memorial to Police erected in the centre of the town&#x27;s roundabout. Mansfield Cemetery is the burial ground for police officers slain by Ned Kelly and his gang at Stringybark Creek.

Dr. John Pearson Rowe (1810–1878) was a physician and squatter who owned the &#x27;Loyola Run&#x27; (also known as Mount Battery) near Mansfield. Reputed as the first Roman Catholic resident of the district, it is recorded that nearby Rochester was named after J. P. Rowe, as he owned land on the Campaspe River. Rowe was a principal founder of the University of Melbourne. He fired a shot at a 14-year-old Ned Kelly accompanied by bushranger Harry Power in 1869. Rowe stood for the Upper House seat of the Murray District in 1859 and was defeated. In October 1878 Rowe supplied information to police Sergeant Kennedy on the whereabouts of Ned Kelly. Acting on Rowe&#x27;s verified advice, Kennedy and his police party rode into the Wombat Ranges, where three of them were killed; and the Kelly Gang legend was born.

By 1878, the town had half a dozen general stores, several butchers, and blacksmiths. Public buildings included the shire hall and library, a hospital, three churches, and Victoria Hall (where concerts were held).

The railway to Mansfield arrived in the town from Tallarook in 1891, being closed on 18 November 1978. The last passenger service was on 28 May 1977. The former Mansfield station building near High Street now serves tourists to the community as a visitor centre.

Around 9:15am on 22 September 2021, Geoscience Australia detected a magnitude-5.9 earthquake centred at Licola, around 130km from Mansfield at a depth of 10km.

==Literature==

The area round Mansfield named as &quot;Banbury&quot; was also the location of the novel &quot;The Far Country&quot; by Nevil Shute which featured logging on Mount Buller and previous forest fires, which having swept through Howqua obliterated almost all traces of a former settlement.

==Recreation==
Mansfield is very close to two large lakes, Lake Eildon and Lake Nillahcootie. During the summer these sites are popular waterskiing destinations.

The nearby Mount Buller and Mount Stirling offer attractions all year round. During winter they are visited for skiing, lifted and back country respectively. In the summer hiking and mountain biking are popular. Ski lifts operate year-round at Mount Buller allowing bikers to easily get to the top of downhill mountain biking runs.

The bushland around Mansfield is used for horse riding, trail biking and four wheel driving on extensive tracks throughout the region.

In past years, the &quot;Mansfield Balloon Festival&quot; celebrated hot air balloons, and drew crowds and enthusiasts from across the state. The balloon Festival hasn&#x27;t been to Mansfield for several years.

Mansfield is also the home to the Mansfield Eagles football club, an Australian Rules team competing in the Goulburn Valley Football League.

Mansfield has a horse racing club, the Mansfield District Racing Club, which schedules two race meetings a year, including the Mansfield Cup meeting on 27 December).

Golfers play at the Mansfield golf course on Kidston Parade.

Mansfield is at one end of the Great Victorian Rail Trail, which officially opened in 2012. The rail trail is the second longest in Australia, and is used by push bike riders, horse riders, and walkers.

==Climate==

Mansfield has a temperate mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), with warm dry summers and cool rainy winters. Diurnal range is extraordinary, due to the very cold mornings in summer brought about by frequent cold front activity.

<text>Pachypodium saundersii, the kudu lily, is a succulent plant of the family Apocynaceae. It was named in honour of Sir Charles James Renault Saunders (1857–1931), the Natal Province civil servant and casual plant collector.

It is found naturally in Southern Africa, on the Lebombo Mountains and other areas in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Eswatini (Swaziland).

It is usually a small, shrubby bush, but can grow up to 1.5m tall. The plant is covered in paired, sharp thorns, and dark green shiny leaves, and it flowers annually producing masses of white flowers that have a pinkish/purplish tinge to them.

<text>The fluctuation–dissipation theorem (FDT) or fluctuation–dissipation relation (FDR) is a powerful tool in statistical physics for predicting the behavior of systems that obey detailed balance. Given that a system obeys detailed balance, the theorem is a proof that thermodynamic fluctuations in a physical variable predict the response quantified by the admittance or impedance (in their general sense, not only in electromagnetic terms) of the same physical variable (like voltage, temperature difference, etc.), and vice versa. The fluctuation–dissipation theorem applies both to classical and quantum mechanical systems.

The fluctuation–dissipation theorem was proven by Herbert Callen and Theodore Welton in 1951
and expanded by Ryogo Kubo. There are antecedents to the general theorem, including Einstein&#x27;s explanation of Brownian motion
during his &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; and Harry Nyquist&#x27;s explanation in 1928 of Johnson noise in electrical resistors.

==Qualitative overview and examples==

The fluctuation–dissipation theorem says that when there is a process that dissipates energy, turning it into heat (e.g., friction), there is a reverse process related to thermal fluctuations. This is best understood by considering some examples:

==Examples in detail==
The fluctuation–dissipation theorem is a general result of statistical thermodynamics that quantifies the relation between the fluctuations in a system that obeys detailed balance and the response of the system to applied perturbations.

===Brownian motion===
For example, Albert Einstein noted in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion that the same random forces that cause the erratic motion of a particle in Brownian motion would also cause drag if the particle were pulled through the fluid. In other words, the fluctuation of the particle at rest has the same origin as the dissipative frictional force one must do work against, if one tries to perturb the system in a particular direction.

From this observation Einstein was able to use statistical mechanics to derive the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation

formula_1

which connects the diffusion constant &quot;D&quot; and the particle mobility , the ratio of the particle&#x27;s terminal drift velocity to an applied force. is the Boltzmann constant, and is the absolute temperature.

===Thermal noise in a resistor===
In 1928, John B. Johnson discovered and Harry Nyquist explained Johnson–Nyquist noise. With no applied current, the mean-square voltage depends on the resistance formula_2, formula_3, and the bandwidth formula_4 over which the voltage is measured:

formula_5

This observation can be understood through the lens of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Take, for example, a simple circuit consisting of a resistor with a resistance formula_2 and a capacitor with a small capacitance formula_7. Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law yields

formula_8

and so the response function for this circuit is

formula_9

In the low-frequency limit formula_10, its imaginary part is simply

formula_11

which then can be linked to the power spectral density function formula_12 of the voltage via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem

formula_13

The Johnson–Nyquist voltage noise formula_14 was observed within a small frequency bandwidth formula_15 centered around formula_16. Hence

formula_17

==General formulation==
The fluctuation–dissipation theorem can be formulated in many ways; one particularly useful form is the following:.

Let formula_18 be an observable of a dynamical system with Hamiltonian formula_19 subject to thermal fluctuations.
The observable formula_18 will fluctuate around its mean value formula_21 with fluctuations characterized by a power spectrum formula_22.
Suppose that we can switch on a time-varying, spatially constant field formula_23 which alters the Hamiltonian to formula_24.
The response of the observable formula_18 to a time-dependent field formula_23 is 
characterized to first order by the susceptibility or linear response function
formula_27 of the system

formula_28

where the perturbation is adiabatically (very slowly) switched on at formula_29.

The fluctuation–dissipation theorem relates the two-sided power spectrum (i.e. both positive and negative frequencies) of formula_30 to the imaginary part of the Fourier transform formula_31 of the susceptibility formula_27:
formula_33

which holds under the Fourier transform convention formula_34. The left-hand side describes &quot;fluctuations&quot; in formula_30, the right-hand side is closely related to the energy &quot;dissipated&quot; by the system when pumped by an oscillatory field formula_36. The spectrum of fluctuations reveal the linear response, because past fluctuations cause future fluctuations via a linear response upon itself.

This is the classical form of the theorem; quantum fluctuations are taken into account by replacing formula_37 with formula_38 (whose limit for formula_39 is formula_40). A proof can be found by means of the LSZ reduction, an identity from quantum field theory.

The fluctuation–dissipation theorem can be generalized in a straightforward way to the case of space-dependent fields, to the case of several variables or to a quantum-mechanics setting.

==Derivation==
===Classical version===
We derive the fluctuation–dissipation theorem in the form given above, using the same notation.
Consider the following test case: the field has been on for infinite time and is switched off at 

formula_41
where formula_42 is the Heaviside function.
We can express the expectation value of by the probability distribution and the transition probability formula_43

formula_44

The probability distribution function &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,0) is an equilibrium distribution and hence given by the Boltzmann distribution for the Hamiltonian formula_45

formula_46
where formula_47.
For a weak field formula_48, we can expand the right-hand side

formula_49

here formula_50 is the equilibrium distribution in the absence of a field. Plugging this approximation in the formula for formula_51 yields

where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the auto-correlation function of &quot;x&quot; in the absence of a field:

formula_52

Note that in the absence of a field the system is invariant under time-shifts. We can rewrite formula_53 using the susceptibility of the system and hence find with the above 

formula_54

Consequently,
To make a statement about frequency dependence, it is necessary to take the Fourier transform of . By integrating by parts, it is possible to show that
formula_55

Since formula_56 is real and symmetric, it follows that
formula_57

Finally, for stationary processes, the Wiener–Khinchin theorem states that the two-sided spectral density is equal to the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function:
formula_58

Therefore, it follows that
formula_59

=== Quantum version===

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates the correlation function of the observable of interest formula_60 (a measure of fluctuation) to the imaginary part of the response function formula_61 in the frequency domain (a measure of dissipation). A link between these quantities can be found through the so-called Kubo formula

formula_62

which follows, under the assumptions of the linear response theory, from the time evolution of the ensemble average of the observable formula_63 in the presence of a perturbing source. Once Fourier transformed, the Kubo formula allows writing the imaginary part of the response function as

formula_64

In the canonical ensemble, the second term can be re-expressed as

formula_65

where in the second equality we re-positioned formula_66 using the cyclic property of trace. Next, in the third equality, we inserted formula_67 next to the trace and interpreted formula_68 as a time evolution operator formula_69 with imaginary time interval formula_70. The imaginary time shift turns into a formula_71 factor after Fourier transform

formula_72

and thus the expression for formula_73 can be easily rewritten as the quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation 

formula_74

where the power spectral density formula_75 is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation formula_76 and formula_77 is the Bose-Einstein distribution function. The same calculation also yields

formula_78

thus, differently from what obtained in the classical case, the power spectral density is not exactly frequency-symmetric in the quantum limit. Consistently, formula_60 has an imaginary part originating from the commutation rules of operators. The additional &quot;formula_80&quot; term in the expression of formula_81 at positive frequencies can also be thought of as linked to spontaneous emission. An often cited result is also the symmetrized power spectral density

formula_82

The &quot;formula_83&quot; can be thought of as linked to quantum fluctuations, or to zero-point motion of the observable formula_84. At high enough temperatures, formula_85, i.e. the quantum contribution is negligible, and we recover the classical version.

==Violations in glassy systems==
While the fluctuation–dissipation theorem provides a general relation between the response of systems obeying detailed balance, when detailed balance is violated comparison of fluctuations to dissipation is more complex. Below the so called glass temperature formula_86, glassy systems are not equilibrated, and slowly approach their equilibrium state. This slow approach to equilibrium is synonymous with the violation of detailed balance. Thus these systems require large time-scales to be studied while they slowly move toward equilibrium.
To study the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation in glassy systems, particularly spin glasses, researchers have performed numerical simulations of macroscopic systems (i.e. large compared to their correlation lengths) described by the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model using supercomputers. In their simulations, the system is initially prepared at a high temperature, rapidly cooled to a temperature formula_87 below the glass temperature formula_86, and left to equilibrate for a very long time formula_89 under a magnetic field formula_90. Then, at a later time formula_91, two dynamical observables are probed, namely the response function
formula_92
and the spin-temporal correlation function
formula_93
where formula_94 is the spin living on the node formula_30 of the cubic lattice of volume formula_96, and formula_97 is the magnetization density. The fluctuation-dissipation relation in this system can be written in terms of these observables as
formula_98

Their results confirm the expectation that as the system is left to equilibrate for longer times, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is closer to be satisfied.

In the mid-1990s, in the study of dynamics of spin glass models, a generalization of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem was discovered that holds for asymptotic non-stationary states, where the temperature appearing in the equilibrium relation is substituted by an effective temperature with a non-trivial dependence on the time scales. This relation is proposed to hold in glassy systems beyond the models for which it was initially found.

==Nonequilibrium driven systems==
In systems subjected to an external driving force, which could be an electromagnetic field or a mechanical shear flow, the standard fluctuation-dissipation theorem gets modified because the statistics of the bath is influenced by the driving field. As a result, the thermal noise becomes biased and the fluctuation-dissipation relation becomes intrinsically non-Markovian, typically with a memory related to the time-autocorrelation of the external field (for the case of a time-dependent external drive). These modified fluctuation-dissipation relations can be derived from a Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian for a particle interacting with a thermal bath, where both the particle and the bath respond to the external field.

<text>Jacob Otto Dietrich (31 August 1897 – 22 November 1952) was a German SS officer during the Nazi era, who served as the Press Chief of the Nazi regime and was a confidant of Adolf Hitler.

==Biography==

Otto Dietrich was born in Essen, he served as a soldier during World War I and was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class). Afterwards he studied at the universities of Munich, Frankfurt am Main and Freiburg, from which he graduated with a doctorate in political science in 1921.

Dietrich worked for newspapers in Essen and Munich. In 1929 he became a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) as a Personal Press Referent. Here he was able to introduce Hitler to numerous important officials within different sects of the mining industry to help secure funding for the Nazi Party. On 1 August 1931 he was appointed Press Chief of the NSDAP, and the following year joined the SS. On 2 June 1933 Hitler appointed Dietrich a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 1 November, he was named Vice-President of the Reich Press Chamber (&quot;Reichspressekammer&quot;) under Max Amann. On February 28, 1934, Hitler raised Dietrich to the position of Reich Press Chief of the Nazi Party. In March 1936 he was elected as a Nazi member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. On 26 November 1937, Dietrich became the Reich Press Chief of the Government and a State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. On April 20, 1941 he had risen to the rank of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;.

In the decree from Hitler on February 28, 1934 the role of the Reich Press Chief was loosely explained: &quot;He directs in my name the guiding principles for the entire editorial work of the Party Press. In addition, as my Press Chief he is the highest authority for all press publications of the Party and all its agencies.&quot; Dietrich, as the Press Chief of the Nazi Party and later as the Reich Press Chief of the Government, had control over the Nazi party&#x27;s publications and newspapers. This included anything disseminated to the SS, SA, Hitler Youth, and the German Labor Front. The work done by Dietrich helped to secure the Nazis foothold in Germany. He aided party members to acquire positions of power and general acceptance within different communities and helped to spread Nazi ideology to the public.

His job as Press Chief overlapped with Joseph Goebbels&#x27;s Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, and thus many anecdotes exist of their feuds. They were infamous for their disagreements, and both often felt obliged to &quot;repair&quot; the mistakes of the other. Dietrich believed himself to be the supreme commander over the German press and so sought to lessen Goebbels&#x27;s influence within the Press Department.

Dietrich had a close relationship with Hitler. In some testimony from Hans Fritzsche, the head of the German Press Division from December 1938 to November 1942, who worked under Dietrich, he noted that: &quot;For years he (Dietrich) also summarized the press telegrams, which constituted one of the most important sources of information for Hitler. Finally I could see for myself that he elaborated Hitler&#x27;s speeches for publication. Thus Dr. Dietrich also functioned as the transmitter of Hitler&#x27;s current directives to Dr. Goebbels.&quot; However, in the secrecy mandated by war, Dietrich, who was not in Hitler&#x27;s &quot;inner circle,&quot; often did not truly know of Hitler&#x27;s whereabouts.

Dietrich retained the confidence of the &quot;Führer&quot; throughout the regime until Hitler accused him of defeatism and placed him on indefinite leave after an argument on 30 March 1945. After the war ended, he was arrested by the British. In 1949, he was tried at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, where he was convicted of crimes against humanity and being a member of a criminal organization, namely the SS, and was sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. Dietrich&#x27;s conviction for crimes against humanity stemmed from anti-Semitic propaganda which he broadcast.&quot;These press and periodical directives were not mere political polemics, they were not aimless expressions of anti-Semitism, and they were not designed only to unite the German people in the war effort.&quot;

&quot;Their clear and expressed purpose was to enrage Germans against the Jews, to justify the measures taken and to be taken against them, and to subdue any doubts which might arise as to the justice of measures of racial persecution to which Jews were to be subjected.&quot;

&quot;By them Dietrich consciously implemented, and by furnishing the excuses and justifications, participated in, the crimes against humanity regarding Jews charged in count five.&quot;Dietrich was released from prison in August 1950. He died in November 1952 in Düsseldorf.

==Memoir: &quot;The Hitler I Knew&quot;==

In captivity in Landsberg Prison, Dietrich wrote &quot;The Hitler I Knew. Memoirs of the Third Reich&#x27;s Press Chief&quot;, a book sharply critical of Hitler personally and strongly denouncing the crimes committed in the name of Nazism. The first part of the book contains assessments by Dietrich about his character, his reflections on Hitler as a politician and as a soldier, and his critique of his leadership. The second part (&quot;Scenes from Hitler&#x27;s Life&quot;) describes Dietrich&#x27;s first-hand oberservations of Hitler&#x27;s daily activities before and during the war. The book translated by Richard and Clara Winston was published by Methuen in 1957, and republished in 2010 by Skyhorse Publishing, with a new introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse.

<text>Anna Bolena is a tragic opera (&quot;tragedia lirica&quot;) in two acts composed by Gaetano Donizetti. Felice Romani wrote the Italian libretto after Ippolito Pindemonte&#x27;s &quot;Enrico VIII ossia Anna Bolena&quot; and Alessandro Pepoli&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, both recounting the life of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England&#x27;s King Henry VIII.

It is one of four operas by Donizetti dealing with the Tudor period in English history—in composition order, &quot;Il castello di Kenilworth&quot; (1829), &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; (1830), &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (named for Mary, Queen of Scots, it appeared in different forms in 1834 and 1835), and &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; (1837, named for a putative lover of Queen Elizabeth I of England). The leading female characters of the latter three operas are often referred to as &quot;the Three Donizetti Queens.&quot;

&quot;Anna Bolena&quot; premiered on 26 December 1830 at the Teatro Carcano in Milan, to &quot;overwhelming success.&quot; Weinstock notes that only after this success did Donizetti&#x27;s teacher, Johann Simon Mayr, &quot;address his former pupil as Maestro.&quot; The composer had begun &quot;to emerge as one of three most luminous names in the world of Italian opera&quot;, alongside Bellini and Rossini.

== Performance history ==
19th century
After its opening performances in Italy in 1830, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; was first given in London at the King&#x27;s Theatre on 8 July 1831. Its first US performance was given in French (as &quot;Anne de Boulen&quot;) in New Orleans, at the Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans on 12 November 1839. The New York premiere of the opera, and the first Italian presentation of the work in the United States, took place at the Astor Opera House on January 7, 1850, with conductor Max Maretzek and Apollonia Bertucca in the title role. It appears to have been presented in Europe, up to 1850, in 25 cities and then again in 1881 in Livorno. After the rise of &quot;verismo&quot;, it was performed infrequently.

20th century and beyond

Rarely seen in the first half of the 20th century, it was revived more frequently after World War II. On 30 December 1947, the opera was performed at Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, to mark that theatre&#x27;s centennial (it had opened in 1847 with &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;). The cast was Sara Scuderi as Anna, Giulietta Simionato as Jane Seymour and Cesare Siepi as Henry VIII. In April 1957, the opera was revived at La Scala for Maria Callas (one of the seven performances was recorded) in a lavish production directed by Luchino Visconti, with Giulietta Simionato as Jane Seymour. It proved to be one of Callas&#x27; greatest triumphs. In the revival the following year, Callas and Simionato repeated their roles and were joined by Siepi as the king, this role having been sung by Nicola Rossi-Lemeni at the premiere the year before.

Since its 1850 performance, the opera was not performed again in the United States until it was presented in a concert version by the American Opera Society in October 1957 with Gloria Davy the title role and Simionato as Giovanna Seymour for performances at both Town Hall and Carnegie Hall. On 26 June 1959, the Santa Fe Opera mounted the first fully staged production of the work since 1839. Several famous modern sopranos have lent their voices to the role, including Leyla Gencer, Montserrat Caballé, Marisa Galvany, Renata Scotto, Edita Gruberova and Mariella Devia. In the 1970s, Beverly Sills earned a considerable degree of fame when she appeared in all three of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Tudor&quot; operas at the New York City Opera. (She also made studio recordings of all three operas.) And Anna was one of the last new roles performed by Dame Joan Sutherland, at San Francisco Opera in 1984.

While not yet part of the &quot;standard repertory&quot;, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; is increasingly performed today, and there are several recordings.

It was presented by the Dallas Opera in November 2010, which has also staged &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;. The Minnesota Opera presented &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; as part of the &quot;Three Queens&quot; trilogy. The Vienna State Opera gave it in the Spring of 2011, with Anna Netrebko in the title role and Elīna Garanča as Giovanna Seymour. New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera mounted it for the first time in September 2011, opening the company&#x27;s 2011–2012 season, with Netrebko and with David McVicar directing. Opera Seria UK in Manchester, England, staged &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; in 2012 as the first in their &quot;Tudor Queens&quot; trilogy, which continues into 2014. And the Welsh National Opera presented the trilogy between September and November 2013, in many different venues in Britain. The Lyric Opera of Chicago also included &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; in their 2014–2015 season. Sondra Radvanovsky has sung the title role at several opera houses including the Met in 2015.

== Roles ==
== Synopsis ==
:Time: 1536
:Place: Windsor and London
===Act 1===
&quot;Scene One: Night. Windsor Castle, Queen&#x27;s apartments&quot;

Courtiers comment that the queen&#x27;s star is setting, because the king&#x27;s fickle heart burns with another love.

Jane Seymour enters to attend a call by the Queen; Anna enters and notes that people seem sad. The queen admits to Jane that she is troubled. At the queen&#x27;s request, her page Smeaton plays the harp and sings in an attempt to cheer the people present. The queen asks him to stop. Unheard by any one else, she says to herself that the ashes of her first love are still burning, and that she is now unhappy in her vain splendor. All leave, except Jane.

Henry VIII enters and tells Jane that soon she will have no rival, that the altar has been prepared for her, and that she will have husband, sceptre, and throne. Each leaves by a different door.

&quot;Scene Two: Day. Around Windsor Castle&quot;

Lord Rochefort, Anna&#x27;s brother, is surprised to meet Lord Richard Percy, who has been called back to England from exile by Henry VIII. Percy asks if it is true that the Queen is unhappy and that the King has changed. Rochefort answers that love is never content.

Hunters enter. Percy is agitated at the prospect of possibly seeing Anna, who was his first love. Henry and Anna enter and express surprise at seeing Percy. Henry does not allow Percy to kiss his hand, but says that Anna has given him assurances of Percy&#x27;s innocence but she still has feelings for Percy. Henry VIII tells Hervey, an officer of the king, to spy on every step and every word of Anna and Percy.

&quot;Scene Three: Windsor Castle, close to the Queen&#x27;s apartments&quot;

Smeaton takes a locket from his breast containing Anna&#x27;s portrait. He has stolen it and has come to return it. He hears a sound and hides behind a screen. Anna and Rochefort enter. Rochefort asks Anna to hear Percy. Then he leaves. Smeaton peeps out from behind the screen, but cannot escape. Percy enters. Percy says that he sees that Anna is unhappy. She tells him that the king now loathes her. Percy says that he still loves her. Anna tells him not to speak to her of love. Before leaving, Percy asks whether he can see Anna again. She says no. He draws his sword to stab himself, and Anna screams. In the mistaken belief that Percy is attacking Anna, Smeaton rushes out from behind the screen. Smeaton and Percy are about to fight. Anna faints, and Rochefort rushes in. Just then, Henry VIII enters and sees the unsheathed swords. Summoning attendants, he says that these persons have betrayed their king. Smeaton says that it is not true, and tears open his tunic to offer his breast to the king for slaying if he is lying. The locket with Anna&#x27;s portrait falls at the king&#x27;s feet. The king snatches it up. He orders that the offenders be dragged to dungeons. Anna says to herself that her fate is sealed.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene One: London. Antechamber of the Queen&#x27;s apartments&quot;

The guards note that even Jane Seymour has stayed away from Anna. Anna enters with a retinue of ladies, who tell her to place her trust in heaven. Hervey enters and says that the Council of Peers has summoned the ladies into its presence. The ladies leave with Hervey. Jane enters and says that Anna can avoid being put to death by admitting guilt. Anna says that she will not buy her life with infamy. She expresses the hope that her successor will wear a crown of thorns. Jane admits that she is to be the successor. Anna tells her to leave, but says that Henry VIII alone is the guilty one. Jane leaves, deeply upset.

&quot;Scene Two: Antechamber leading into the hall where the Council of Peers is meeting&quot;

Hervey tells courtiers that Anna is lost, because Smeaton has talked and has revealed a crime. Henry VIII enters. Hervey says that Smeaton has fallen into the trap. Henry VIII tells Hervey to continue to let Smeaton believe that he has saved Anna&#x27;s life. 
Anna and Percy are brought in, separately. Henry VIII says that Anna has made love to the page Smeaton, and that there are witnesses. He says that both Anna and Percy will die. Percy says that it is written in heaven that he and Anna are married. They are led away by guards.

Jane enters. She says that she does not want to be the cause of Anna&#x27;s death. Henry VIII says that she will not save Anna by leaving. Hervey enters and says that the council has dissolved the royal marriage and has condemned Anna and her accomplices to death. Courtiers and Jane ask the king to be merciful. He tells them to leave.

&quot;Scene Three: Tower of London&quot;

Percy and Rochefort are together in their cell. Hervey enters and says that the king has pardoned them. They ask about Anna. Hearing that she is to be executed, they choose to be executed also. They leave, surrounded by guards.

In Anna&#x27;s cell, a chorus of ladies comment on her madness and grief. Anna enters, she imagines that it is her wedding day to the king. Then she imagines that she sees Percy, and she asks him to take her back to her childhood home (Donizetti used the theme from the English/American song Home Sweet Home as part of Anna&#x27;s Mad Scene to underscore her longing). Percy, Rochefort and Smeaton are brought in. Smeaton throws himself at Anna&#x27;s feet and says that he accused her in the belief that he was saving her life. In her delirium, Anna asks him why he is not playing his lute. Cannon fire sounds and Anna regains her senses. She is told that Giovanna and Enrico are being acclaimed by the populace on their wedding day. Anna says she does not wish vengeance on them. She faints. Guards enter to lead the prisoners to the block.

<doc id="552280" wikidata="Q672708" url="?curid=552280" title="Roberto Devereux">
<text>Roberto Devereux (in full , ; &quot;Robert Devereux, or the Earl of Essex&quot;) is an 1837 (tragic opera) in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti. The opera is loosely based on the life of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, an influential member of the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England.

Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian-language libretto based on François Ancelot&#x27;s French tragedy (Paris, 1832), with some of the text taken from Felice Romani&#x27;s libretto for Saverio Mercadante&#x27;s opera &quot;Il conte d&#x27;Essex&quot; (Milan, 1833), also based on Ancelot&#x27;s play. Cammarano&#x27;s libretto also incorporated elements from the 1787 French play (1787) by Jacques Lescène des Maisons. Devereux was the subject of at least two earlier French plays, both titled : one in 1638 by Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède, and one in 1678 by Thomas Corneille.

It is one of a number of operas by Donizetti which deal with the Tudor period of English history and which include &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; (about Anne Boleyn), &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (about Mary, Queen of Scots) and . The lead female characters – Anne Boleyn, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth herself – have been referred to as the &quot;Three Donizetti Queens.&quot; They became popular in the 1970s, when the American soprano Beverly Sills promoted them as a series at New York City Opera.

It has been said that, &quot;although the plot plays fast and loose with history, the opera carries its own brand of dramatic conviction&quot;.

==Origin==
The contract for a new opera seria for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples was concluded in spring 1837. The generation of &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; was overshadowed by serious crises in the life of the composer. During the previous year, Donizetti had lost both his parents and then his wife Virginia Vaselli delivered a stillborn baby. In June 1837, another child died during birth. On 30 July, his wife died at the age of 28. Rehearsals for the premiere began at the end of August 1837; most of the score had to be written in the month following his wife&#x27;s death. Additionally, a cholera epidemic delayed again the start of rehearsals.

Salvatore Cammarano&#x27;s libretto is very truthful to Jacques-François Ancelot&#x27;s tragedy, a romantic rewrite of the material already dealt with by Pierre Corneille and La Calprenède in France, to which he added individual touches from Lescènes&#x27;s &quot;Histoire&quot;. The plot is hardly original, mainly derived from Felice Romani&#x27;s libretto of 1833, originally set by Saverio Mercadante. Romani&#x27;s widow charged Cammarano with plagiarism; the practice of stealing plots was very common between rival Italian opera houses.

==Performance history==
19th century

&quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; was first performed on 28 October 1837 at the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples. Within a few years, the opera&#x27;s success had caused it to be performed in most European cities including Paris on 27 December 1838, for which he wrote an overture which quoted, anachronistically, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;; London on 24 June 1841; Rome in 1849; Palermo in 1857; in Pavia in 1859 and 1860; and in Naples on 18 December 1865. Also, it was given in New York on 15 January 1849, but it would appear that after 1882, no further performances were given during the 19th century.

20th century and beyond

The beginning of the 20th century revivals of &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; started at the San Carlo in Naples in 1964, the revival starring Leyla Gencer. Montserrat Caballé appeared in a combination of concert performances and staged productions between December 1965 and 1978. &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; was first performed by the New York City Opera in October 1970 as the first part of the &quot;Three Queens&quot; trilogy, starring Placido Domingo and Beverly Sills. It was performed on a regular basis in European houses during the 1980s and in concert versions by the Opera Orchestra of New York in January 1991 (with Vladimir Chernov), the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in July 2002, and Washington Concert Opera in 2004.

In 2005 the Bavarian State Opera&#x27;s Munich production starring Edita Gruberová was recorded on DVD by Deutsche Grammophon.

In 2009, performances were given by the Dallas Opera, the Las Palmas Opera, the Opera Holland Park Festival, while 2010 saw productions in Mannheim and Rome as well as by the Minnesota Opera and again Munich&#x27;s Bavarian State Opera plus its first performance in Quebec in November of that year at the Opéra de Montréal. Welsh National Opera presented this opera (along with the other two &quot;Three Queens&quot; operas) in succession over three evenings beginning in October 2013.

After having debuted the role of Elisabetta at the Opéra de Marseille in 2011, Mariella Devia sang the opera in concert at Maggio Musicale Fiorentino on 18 May 2014 and with the Opera Orchestra of New York (OONY) on 5 June 2014. In 2015 she performed it onstage at the Teatro Real de Madrid and resumed it again in 2016 at the Teatro Carlo Felice of Genoa.

The Metropolitan Opera New York performed the opera for the first time in 2016, in a production by David McVicar, starring Sondra Radvanovsky, who also appeared the same season at the Met in the title roles of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;.

Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, favorite of Queen Elisabeth, has been removed from office as Governor of Ireland because, acting on his own initiative, he has agreed to a ceasefire with the rebels. Following an attempted uprising, he is awaiting his trial for high treason in London.

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: The Great Hall at Westminster&quot;

Sara, Duchess of Nottingham, is trying in vain to hide her tears from the eyes of the Court, as she reads the sad story of Fair Rosamond, the unfortunate lover of King Henry II of England, and therein recognizes a very similar situation to her own. She is in love with Robert Devereux, her husband&#x27;s closest friend. The Ladies of the court express concern, but she replies that she is happy, while privately revealing her sadness &quot;(All&#x27;afflitto è dolce il pianto)&quot;. Elizabeth enters and states that, at the insistence of Nottingham, she has agreed to see Robert once again, now that he has returned from Ireland accused of treason &quot;(Duchessa... Alle fervide preci)&quot;. The Queen is willing to release him without charges if she can be sure of his continued loyalty. To Sara&#x27;s gradual dismay, the Queen reveals her love for Robert &quot;(L&#x27;amor suo mi fe&#x27; beata)&quot;. Cecil enters and announces that Parliament is waiting for an answer from the Queen regarding the charges against Robert, since it considers her too lenient towards him, but she refuses to sign the death warrant proposed by the Royal Council.

Robert enters and, in a conversation overheard by the increasingly distraught Sara, Elizabeth declares her love for him. Now alone together, Elizabeth promises Robert that the ring she once gave him will always be the pledge of his safety should he ever return it to her. The dream of bygone happy days is shattered by an inappropriate comment by Robert, who assumes that Elizabeth knows the secret of his love for Sara. The Queen, increasingly jealous, demands that Robert name the woman he loves. He denies that he loves anyone &quot;(Nascondi, frena i palpiti),&quot; and then the Queen leaves.

Nottingham, Robert&#x27;s friend and supporter, enters and the two men discuss Robert&#x27;s situation and Nottingham&#x27;s concerns about his wife&#x27;s behaviour after he has observed her embroidering a blue shawl &quot;(Forse in quel cor sensibile, Qui ribelle ognun ti chiama)&quot;. The two men are interrupted by Cecil demanding that Nottingham attend a meeting of the Peers of the Realm.

&quot;Scene 2: Sara&#x27;s Apartments at Nottingham House&quot;

Sara is alone when Robert enters, declaring her to be faithless because she has married Nottingham while he was in Ireland. She defends herself saying that it was the Queen&#x27;s idea and that she was forced to do her bidding. At the same time, seeing the ring on Robert&#x27;s finger, she assumes it to be a love token from the Queen, and tells him that they must never see each other again, giving him the blue shawl as a love token. In a final duet (&quot;Dacchè tornasti, ahi misera&quot;) each declares love for the other and they accept that they must say goodbye. Robert makes plans to escape.

===Act 2===
&quot;The Great Hall at Westminster&quot;

The Queen approaches Cecil to find out what has been decided. Cecil declares that the sentence is death. The Queen, asking Raleigh why the whole process took so long, learns that Robert had a shawl in his possession which he resisted giving over. It is handed to her. Nottingham enters and pleads for Robert&#x27;s life &quot;(Non venni mai si mesto),&quot; insisting that he is innocent, but the Queen continues to describe how she knows that Robert has been unfaithful and, when he is brought in, confronts him, showing him the scarf. Nottingham sees it as well and recognizes it. Furious, he declares that he will have vengeance; while at the same time, Elizabeth offers Robert his freedom if he reveals the name of her rival. He refuses and she signs the death warrant, announcing that a cannon shot will be heard as the axe falls. Nottingham fumes that the axe is not a suitable punishment.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: Sara&#x27;s Apartments&quot;

Alone, Sara receives Robert&#x27;s ring along with a letter from him. In it, he tells her to take the ring to Elizabeth and beg for mercy. Before she can leave, Nottingham arrives and reads the letter &quot;(Non sai che un nume vindice).&quot; Although she protests her innocence, he prevents her from leaving. They both hear the funeral march for Robert as he is led to the Tower, and Nottingham leaves to exact his revenge on Robert. She faints.

&quot;Scene 2: The Tower of London&quot;

In his cell, Robert ponders as to why it appears that his ring has not been received by the Queen. But he refuses to betray Sara &quot;(Come uno spirto angelico... Bagnato il sen di lagrime&quot;), and when Cecil arrives at the door of the cell, it is not to free Robert but to take him to his execution. He is led away.

&quot;Scene 3: The Great Hall at Westminster&quot;

Elizabeth is mournful about the pending death of her lover and wonders why Sara is not there to give her comfort &quot;(Vivi ingrato, a lei d&#x27;accanto)&quot;. Cecil announces that Robert is on his way to the block, and Sara arrives disheveled. She gives Elizabeth the ring along with confessing her guilt at being the Queen&#x27;s rival. In vain, the Queen tries to stop the execution, but they hear the cannon announcing Robert&#x27;s death. After Nottingham has arrived, Elizabeth demands to know why he prevented the ring from being brought to her. He replies: &quot;Blood I wanted, and blood I got!&quot; Elizabeth is haunted by the headless corpse of Robert, and longs for her own death, announcing that James VI of Scotland (son of Mary Queen of Scots) will be king. Alone, she kisses Robert&#x27;s ring.

== Music ==
Although not frequently performed today, it contains some of Donizetti&#x27;s best vocal writing, some of it &quot;first rate&quot; (the end of act 1&#x27;s duet between Roberto and Sara beginning with &quot;&quot; (Since you returned, ah miserable me!)), while the brief second act is &quot;superb.&quot; The opera is raw and emotional; it is a powerful vehicle for the soprano. Some of the highlights include the act 1 duet between Elizabeth and Robert, &quot; (Hide and check your wild beating / oh my unhappy heart). The final scene is one of the most dramatic and difficult in bel canto opera. As Elizabeth is going mad with the death of her lover, &quot; (That spilled blood / rises to heaven) pushes romantic opera to the limits of melodic expression and has been described as &quot;mak(ing) a powerful end to one of Donizetti&#x27;s finest and most affecting operas.&quot; The final bars contain six high As, one high B-flat and one high B natural, sometimes interpolated as an alt D natural.

<text>Heinrich Otto Wieland (; 4 June 1877 – 5 August 1957) was a German chemist. He won the 1927 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research into the bile acids.

==Career==
In 1901 Wieland received his doctorate at the University of Munich while studying under Johannes Thiele. In 1904 he completed his habilitation, then continued to teach at the university and starting in 1907 was a consultant for Boehringer Ingelheim. In 1914 he became associate professor for special topics in organic chemistry, and director of the Organic Division of the State Laboratory in Munich. From 1917 to 1918 Wieland worked in the service of the (KWI) Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Dahlem then led by Fritz Haber as an alternative to regular military service. There he was involved in weapons research for instance finding new synthetic routes for mustard gas. He is also credited with the first synthesis of Adamsite.

From 1913 to 1921, he was Professor at the Technical University of Munich. He then moved to the University of Freiburg as successor of Ludwig Gattermann (he also assumed responsibility for Gattermanns famous cookbook). In Freiburg he started working on toad poisons and bile acids. In association with Boehringer Ingelheim he worked on synthetic alkaloids such as morphine and strychnine.

In 1925 Wieland succeeded Richard Willstätter as Chemistry Professor at the University of Munich.

In 1941, Wieland isolated the toxin alpha-amanitin, the principal active agent of one of the world&#x27;s most poisonous mushrooms &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;.

Wieland tried successfully to protect people, especially Jewish students, who were &quot;racially burdened&quot; after the Nuremberg Laws. Students who were expelled because they were &quot;racially burdened&quot; could stay in Heinrich Wieland&#x27;s group as chemists or as &quot;Gäste des Geheimrats&quot; (guests of the privy councillor). Hans Conrad Leipelt, a student of Wieland, was sentenced to death after collecting money for Kurt Huber&#x27;s widow Clara Huber.

==Family==
Heinrich&#x27;s father, Theodor Wieland (1846–1928) was a pharmacist with a doctorate in chemistry. He owned a gold and silver refinery in Pforzheim. Heinrich Wieland was a cousin of Helene Boehringer, the wife of Albert Boehringer, who was the founder of the Boehringer Ingelheim pharmaceutical company. He worked for the company from 1915 to 1920 and established the company&#x27;s scientific department.

Eva Wieland, Heinrich Wieland&#x27;s daughter, was married to Feodor Lynen on 14 May 1937.

==Heinrich Wieland Prize==
Since 1964, the Heinrich Wieland Prize has been awarded annually. First to promote research on chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and clinical medicine of lipids and related substances, nowadays the prize is awarded for outstanding research on biologically active molecules and systems in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology as well as on their clinical importance. The prize is among the most treasured international science awards and has a successful history of over 50 years. The Heinrich Wieland Prize has been sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim from 2000 to 2010. From 2011, it has been awarded by the Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation. The awardees have always been selected by an independent Board of Trustees. Since 2014, it has been endowed with 100,000 euros.

<text>Antonio Rafael Armas Machado (born July 2, 1953) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an outfielder from 1976 to 1989. He is the father of pitcher Tony Armas Jr. and the older brother of outfielder Marcos Armas.

Armas was one of the top power hitters in the American League in the early 1980s. Twice he led the American League in home runs, and topped all of Major League Baseball in runs batted in during the season. Armas was prone to injuries and went on the disabled list twelve times during his major league career, missing 302 games.

==Career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Armas debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Gulf Coast League affiliate in just shy of his eighteenth birthday. He spent six seasons in their farm system, batting .270 with 69 home runs when he received a September call-up in . He appeared in four games for the Pirates, and collected two hits in six at-bats.

During spring training in , Armas, Doug Bair, Dave Giusti, Rick Langford, Doc Medich and Mitchell Page were dealt to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Chris Batton, Phil Garner and Tommy Helms.

===Oakland A&#x27;s===
Armas was the opening day right fielder for the A&#x27;s in 1977, though by the end of the season, he was starting in center and saw most of his action there. Armas&#x27; inability to stay healthy limited him to just 91 games in and 80 in . For , Armas became a full-time right fielder, and finally played a full season, batting .279 with 35 home runs and 109 runs batted in in 158 games.

In the strike shortened season, Armas tied for the league lead in home runs (22) and games played (109) to be named the &quot;American League Player of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. In he set a pair of major league records with eleven putouts and twelve total chances in right field in a single game against the Toronto Blue Jays. Following the season he was traded, along with Jeff Newman, to the Boston Red Sox for Carney Lansford, Garry Hancock and minor leaguer Jerry King.

===Boston Red Sox===
In Boston, Armas became the center fielder, sharing the outfield with Jim Rice (LF) and Dwight Evans (RF). Although he was booed by fans for his low batting average (.218), he placed second in the AL with 36 home runs and seventh with 107 RBI.

Armas had a monster , batting .268 and leading the AL with 43 home runs, 123 RBI, 77 extra-base hits, and 339 total bases. He was named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and UPI postseason AL All-Star teams, was Boston&#x27;s co-MVP, and placed seventh in AL MVP balloting.

From 1980 to , Armas hit more homers (187) than any other AL player. His next two seasons were ruined by recurring leg injuries and Boston&#x27;s acquisition of Dave Henderson. Armas was released after batting just once in the 1986 World Series. In the following years, he became a valuable role player for the Angels, and he retired after the season.

Twice he finished in the top ten in AL Most Valuable Player award balloting (4th, 1981; 7th, 1984).

===California Angels===
Armas was signed as a free agent by the California Angels In July 1987, and played 3 seasons with them (1987–1989) to finish out his Major League career. For his career playing in 1,432 games over 14 seasons, Armas tallied 251 home runs, 614 runs, 204 doubles, 39 triples, 815 RBI, and 1,302 hits.

==Coaching career==
Armas is the current Batting coach for the Leones del Caracas a team in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.

His playing career in Venezuela was a stellar one. He started playing with the Leones and later joined the Caribes de Oriente.

<doc id="552310" wikidata="Q4713754" url="?curid=552310" title="Alderson Broaddus University">
<text>Alderson Broaddus University (AB) was a private Baptist university in Philippi, West Virginia. It was founded in 1871 and suspended its operations on August 31, 2023.

It was historically affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA. It was formed in 1932 as Alderson-Broaddus College by the union of two Baptist institutions: Alderson Junior College (founded 1901) and Broaddus College (founded 1871). The school adopted its final name in 2013.

Prior to the university&#x27;s closing, its academics were organized into five academic divisions: the College of Health, Science, Technology, and Math; the College of Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences; the College of Business; the College of Medical Science; and the College of Adult and Distance Education. 

Alderson Broaddus was the first college in West Virginia to offer a four-year degree in nursing and the first in the country to offer a four-year physician assistant degree.

==History==

Alderson Broaddus University derived its name from the merging of two Baptist institutions in 1932. The older of the two, Broaddus Institute, was founded in Winchester, Virginia, in 1871 by Edward Jefferson Willis, a Baptist minister who named the new school after Rev. William Francis Ferguson Broaddus, a prominent Baptist minister at the time of the American Civil War. In response to economic hard times, Broaddus Institute was moved across the Allegheny Mountains to Clarksburg, West Virginia, in 1876. The college was moved again to the small town of Philippi in 1909. In 1918, it transitioned back to its former name Broaddus College.

The other institution, Alderson Academy, was founded in Alderson, West Virginia, in 1901 by Emma C. Alderson, a committed Baptist laywoman. Designed as a home school, it provided academic work in classics, sciences and normal studies. Originally supported by the Greenbrier Baptist Church, control was assumed by the West Virginia Baptist Association in 1910.

As the years passed, Broaddus became a junior college, then a senior college—first granting baccalaureate degrees in 1926—and Alderson Academy also added junior college status. Financial hardship in the late 1920s led to a decision to merge the two colleges, which shared common missions and outlooks as Baptist and liberal arts institutions; the merged institution, Alderson-Broaddus College, opened its doors in 1932. Since its founding, Alderson-Broaddus had been committed to a strong liberal arts education that seeks to imbue students with an appreciation of literature and the arts, Christian faith, music, and the sciences. In more recent times, the college was focused on developing programs in the natural and applied sciences as well. In 1945, Alderson-Broaddus developed the first four-year nursing and the first radiologic technology programs in West Virginia.

A portion of the physical assets of Storer College, a Black Baptist college founded in 1865 in Harpers Ferry, were transferred to Alderson-Broaddus in 1964 and used to fund the “Storer Scholarship” given annually to an African-American student.

In 1968, the college pioneered the nation&#x27;s first four-year physician assistant (PA) program, an innovation that had significant influence on the development of the PA profession nationwide. From this program emerged in 1991 the college&#x27;s first graduate degree offering, the Physician Assistant Master&#x27;s program.

In 2011, the college chose Richard Creehan as president. Creehan embarked on a plan to expand the college and the institution increased enrollment by over 600 students, expanded the athletic department, and added many new academic programs. In 2013, the college&#x27;s Board of Governors renamed the institution &quot;Alderson Broaddus University&quot;. That same year, the institution matriculated the largest incoming freshman class in school history.

In June 2017, the Higher Learning Commission put the University on probation because it determined that the institution was at risk due to financial difficulties. In 2019, it was no longer on probation, due to improved financial performance.

On July 31, 2023, the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission revoked Alderson Broaddus University&#x27;s ability to confer degrees after the end of 2023 and ordered to it cease admitting students so it can begin to close. The commission stated that the &quot;University&#x27;s financial condition renders the institution unable to create a stable, effective, and safe learning environment for its students&quot;. The state&#x27;s governor, Jim Justice, worked to help the university stay open and resolve its financial challenges, but they were so significant that the university had failed to pay its recent utility bills. On the same day, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted to close the university. On August 31, 2023, the campus filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.

==Campus==

The university was located on a campus with housing for approximately 1100 students. The campus occupied a rolling hilltop overlooking the Tygart Valley River and the community of Philippi, with its county courthouse, church spires and the historic Philippi Covered Bridge, used by both Confederate and Union troops during the first land battle of the Civil War. 

The Old Main building was built in 1909 but destroyed by fire in 1977. It was replaced by New Main, later renamed Burbick Hall, which was primarily used for administration.

The oldest extant building on the campus, Whitescarver Hall (circa 1911), was named for George M. Whitescarver of Pruntytown, WV. The Classical Revival building was designed by the architectural firm of Holmboe &amp; Lafferty and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

The local general hospital, Broaddus Hospital, was established on the Alderson-Broaddus campus in the 1950s, and operated from there until moving to a new location in the late 1990s.

At the time of closure, the campus included seven residence halls (Priestley Hall, Benedum Hall, Kincaid Hall, Battler Hall, and Blue, Gold and University Halls), Burbick Hall, the old Broaddus Hospital building, the Hamer student center and cafeteria, an arena for basketball, swimming, wrestling, and acrobatics and tumbling programs, tennis courts, a grass field used for intramural sports, a turf field stadium for football, lacrosse, and soccer teams, six academic buildings (including the Withers-Brandon complex for humanities and social sciences, the Kemper-Redd science building and Myers Hall for the health sciences), a building housing Pickett Library and Funkhouser Auditorium, and Wilcox Chapel.

==Athletics==
For much of its existence, Alderson Broaddus&#x27;s primary sport was men&#x27;s soccer (led by Bob Gray from 1978-91). The athletic programme expanded dramatically under President Creehan from 2011, notably with the addition of American football.

Known as the &quot;Battlers&quot; (harkening back to the 1861 Battle of Philippi), Alderson Broaddus was a member of the Mountain East Conference (MEC) and NCAA Division II. The team&#x27;s colors were Navy Blue, Gray and Gold, and its mascot was named Skirmish. At the time of its closure the university offered 20 sports, all at the Varsity level: Football (which became a full varsity program in 2013), Acrobatics &amp; Tumbling, Baseball, Football, Softball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Soccer, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Lacrosse, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Volleyball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Cross Country, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Track &amp; Field, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Wrestling, Men&#x27;s Sprint Football and Cheerleading.

AB and its predecessor institutions had been members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) since that league&#x27;s formation in 1924. The WVIAC disbanded at the end of the 2012–13 school year, after the nine WVIAC members that then played football announced they would break away to form a new league that eventually became the Mountain East Conference.

Shortly after the announcement of the Mountain East split, AB found a new conference home, accepting an invitation to join the G-MAC in the fall of 2013. AB and three other West Virginia schools—former WVIAC members Davis &amp; Elkins and Ohio Valley, plus independent Salem International—all entered the G-MAC.

In 2012 AB started its football program, initially competing at the club level before moving up to Division 2 the following year. Alderson Broaddus originally competed as an independent football team without a conference. In 2016 the G-MAC conference decided to partially make football a competitive sport in the conference with the full competition to start in 2017.The Battlers first defeated Kentucky Wesleyan in the Founders Cup in 2015 to become the first ever G-MAC football Champion. The Battlers became the first G-MAC Conference football champions on 11/12/16 when they defeated Kentucky Wesleyan University 31–28. The G-MAC added another new team to the conference in 2017 of Malone University.

Alderson-Broaddus Baseball won the G-MAC conference title for the first time on May 14, 2016, over Trevecca Nazarene 9–6.

On June 9, 2020, Alderson Broaddus announced that they will leave the Great Midwest Athletic Conference and will join the Mountain East Conference.

With the revocation of the school&#x27;s degree-granting status in July 2023, the university immediately ended all athletic activities.

<text>Sándor Petőfi ( []; né Petrovics; ; ; 1 January 1823 – most likely 31 July 1849) was a Hungarian poet and liberal revolutionary. He is considered Hungary&#x27;s national poet, and was one of the key figures of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He is the author of the &quot;Nemzeti dal&quot; (National Song), which is said to have inspired the revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary that grew into a war for independence from the Austrian Empire. It is most likely, albeit unknown, that he died in the Battle of Segesvár, one of the last battles of the war.

==Early life==
Petőfi was born on the New Year&#x27;s morning of 1823, in the town of Kiskőrös, Kingdom of Hungary. The population of Kiskőrös was predominantly of Slovak origin as a consequence of the Habsburgs&#x27; reconstruction policy designed to settle, where possible, non-Hungarians in areas devastated during the Turkish wars. His birth certificate, in Latin, gives his name as &quot;Alexander Petrovics&quot;, where &quot;Alexander&quot; is the Latin equivalent of the Hungarian &quot;Sándor&quot;. His father, István (Stephanus) Petrovics, was a village butcher, innkeeper and a second-generation Serb or Slovak immigrant to the Great Hungarian Plain. Mária Hrúz, Petőfi&#x27;s mother, was a servant and laundress before her marriage. She was of Slovak descent and spoke Hungarian with something of an accent. Petőfi&#x27;s parents first met in Maglód, married in Aszód and moved to Kiskőrös a year before the birth of the poet.

The family lived for some time in Szabadszállás, where his father owned a slaughterhouse. Within two years, the family moved to Kiskunfélegyháza, and Petőfi always viewed the city as his true home. His father tried to give his son the best possible education and sent him to a lyceum, but when Sándor was 15, the family went through a period of financial hardship due to the Danube floods of 1838 and the bankruptcy of a relative. Sándor had to leave the lyceum which he was attending in Selmecbánya (today Banská Štiavnica in Slovakia). He held small jobs in various theatres in Pest, worked as a teacher in Ostffyasszonyfa, and spent some months as a soldier in Sopron.

After a restless period of travelling, Petőfi attended college at Pápa, where he met Mór Jókai. A year later in 1842, his poem &quot;&quot; (The Wine Drinker) was first published in the literary magazine &quot;Athenaeum&quot; under the name Sándor Petrovics. On 3 November the same year, he published the poem under the surname Petőfi for the first time.

Petőfi was more interested in the theatre. In 1842 he joined a travelling theatre but had to leave it to earn money. He wrote for a newspaper but could not make enough from it. Malnourished and sick, he went to Debrecen, where his friends helped him to get back on his feet.

In 1844 he walked from Debrecen to Pest to find a publisher for his poems and succeeded. His poems were becoming increasingly popular. He relied on folkloric elements and popular, traditional song-like verses.

Among his longer works is the epic &quot;János Vitéz&quot; (John the Valiant; 1845). The poem is a fairy-tale notable for its length, 370 quatrains divided into 27 chapters, and for its clever wordplay. It has gained immense popularity in Hungary, however, Petőfi felt influenced by his editor, Imre Vahot, to continue writing folklore-style poems, while he wanted to use his Western-oriented education and write about growing revolutionary passions. (The government&#x27;s censorship would have made such works difficult to publish.)

==Marriage and family==

In 1846, he met Júlia Szendrey in Transylvania. They married the next year, despite the opposition of her father, and spent their honeymoon at the castle of Count ), the only aristocrat among Petőfi&#x27;s friends. Their only son Zoltán was born on 15 December 1848.

==Political career==
Petőfi became more possessed by thoughts of a global revolution. He and Júlia moved to Pest, where he joined a group of like-minded students and intellectuals who regularly met at . They worked on promoting Hungarian as the language of literature and theatre, formerly based on German. The first permanent Hungarian theatre (), which later became the National Theater, was opened in that time (1837).

==Hungarian Revolution of 1848==
Among the various young leaders of the revolution, called (Youths of March), Petőfi was the key in starting the revolution in Pest. He was co-author and author, respectively, of the two most important written documents: the &quot;12 Points&quot;, a list of demands to the Habsburg Governor-General, and the , his revolutionary poem.

When the news of the revolution in Vienna reached them on the 14th, Petőfi and his friends decided to change the date of the &quot;National Assembly&quot; (a rally in which a petition to the Hungarian noblemen&#x27;s assembly would be approved by the people) from 19 March to the 15 March. On the morning of the 15th, Petőfi and the revolutionaries began to march around the city of Pest, reading his poem and the &quot;12 Points&quot; to the growing crowd, which attracted thousands. Visiting printers, they declared an end to censorship and printed the poem and &quot;12 Points&quot;.

Crowds forced the mayor to sign the &quot;12 Points&quot; and later held a mass demonstration in front of the newly built National Museum, then crossed to Buda on the other bank of the Danube. When the crowd rallied in front of the Imperial governing council, the representatives of Emperor Ferdinand felt they had to sign the &quot;12 Points&quot;. As one of the points was freedom for political prisoners, the crowd moved to greet the newly freed revolutionary poet Mihály Táncsics.

Petőfi&#x27;s popularity waned as the memory of the glorious day faded, and the revolution went the way of high politics to the leadership of the nobles. Those in the noblemen&#x27;s Assembly in Pozsony (today Bratislava) had been pushing for slower reforms at the same time, which they delivered to the Emperor on the 13th, but events had overtaken them briefly. Petőfi disagreed with the Assembly and criticised their view of the goals and methods of the Revolution. (His colleague Táncsics was imprisoned again by the new government.) In the general election, Petőfi ran in his native area but did not win a seat. At this time, he wrote his most serious poem, (The Apostle). It was an epic about a fictional revolutionary who, after much suffering, attempts to assassinate a fictitious king.

Petőfi joined the Hungarian Revolutionary Army and fought under the Polish liberal general Józef Bem, in the Transylvanian army. The army was initially successful against Habsburg troops, but after Tsar Nicholas I of Russia intervened to support the Habsburgs, it was defeated. Petőfi was last seen alive in the Battle of Segesvár on 31 July 1849, he was supposedly stabbed in the back by a jousting Russian soldier, although his body was never found.

==Death==
Petőfi is believed to have been killed in action during the battle of Segesvár by the Imperial Russian Army. A Russian military doctor recorded an account of Petőfi&#x27;s death in his diary. As his body was never officially found, rumours of Petőfi&#x27;s survival persisted. In his autobiographical &quot;roman à clef&quot; &quot;Political Fashions&quot; (, 1862), Mór Jókai imagined his late friend&#x27;s &quot;resurrection&quot;. In the novel Petőfi (the character named Pusztafi) returns ten years later as a shabby, &quot;déclassé&quot; figure who has lost his faith in everything, including poetry.

Although for many years his death at Segesvár had been assumed, in the late 1980s Soviet investigators found archives that revealed that after the battle about 1,800 Hungarian prisoners of war were marched to Siberia. Alternative theories suggest that he was one of them and died of tuberculosis in 1856. In 1990, an expedition was organised to Barguzin, Buryatia, Siberia, where archaeologists claimed to have unearthed Petőfi&#x27;s skeleton. In Hungary there is a saying after him: (Disappeared, like Petőfi in the fog).

==Poetry==
Petőfi started his career as a poet with &quot;popular situation songs&quot;, a genre to which his first published poem, &quot; (The Wine Drinker; 1842), belongs. It is the song of a drinker praising the healing power of wine to drive away all troubles. This kind of pseudo-folk song was not unusual in Hungarian poetry of the 1840s, but Petőfi soon developed an original and fresh voice which made him stand out. He wrote many folk song-like poems on the subjects of wine, love, romantic robbers etc. Many of these early poems have become classics, for example the love poem &quot; (You Cannot Forbid the Flower; 1843), or &quot;&quot; (I Turned into the Kitchen; 1843), which uses the ancient metaphor of love and fire in a playful and somewhat provocative way.

The influence of folk poetry and 19th-century populism is very significant in Petőfi&#x27;s work, but other influences are also present: Petőfi drew on sources such as topoi of contemporary almanac-poetry in an inventive way, and was familiar with the works of major literary figures of his day, including Percy Bysshe Shelley, Pierre-Jean de Béranger and Heinrich Heine.

Petőfi&#x27;s early poetry was often interpreted as some kind of role-playing, due to the broad range of situations and voices he created and used. Recent interpretations however call attention to the fact that in some sense all lyrical poetry can be understood as role-playing, which makes the category of &quot;role-poems&quot; (coined especially for Petőfi) superfluous. While using a variety of voices, Petőfi created a well-formed persona for himself: a jaunty, stubborn loner who loves wine, hates all kinds of limits and boundaries and is passionate in all he feels. In poems such as &quot; (Prophecy, 1843) he imagines himself as someone who will die young after doing great things. This motif recurs in the revolutionary poetry of his later years.

The influence of contemporary almanac-poetry can be best seen in the poem cycle (Branches of Cypress for Etelke&#x27;s Tomb; 1845). These sentimental poems, which are about death, grief, love, memory and loneliness were written after a love interest of Petőfi&#x27;s, Etelke Csapó, died.

In the years 1844–1845, Petőfi&#x27;s poetry became increasingly subtle and mature. New subjects appeared, such as landscape. His most influential landscape poem is &quot; (The Plains), in which he says that his homeland, the Hungarian plains are more beautiful and much dearer than the Carpathian Mountains; it was to become the foundation of a long-lived fashion: that of the plains as the typical Hungarian landscape.

Petőfi&#x27;s poetic skills solidified and broadened. He became a master of using different kinds of voices, for example his poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Good Old Gvadányi&quot;) imitates the style of , a Hungarian poet who lived at the end of the 18th century.

One of his poem, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Liberty and Love&quot;), is also well received by the Chinese and is in schoolbooks in China:


Petőfi maintained a lifelong friendship with János Arany, another significant poet of the time. Arany was the godfather of Petőfi&#x27;s son .

==Honours and memorials==

After the Revolution was crushed, Petőfi&#x27;s writing became immensely popular, while his rebelliousness served as a role model ever since for Hungarian revolutionaries and would-be revolutionaries of every political colour.

Hungarian composer and contemporary Franz Liszt composed the piano piece &quot;Dem Andenken Petőfis&quot; (&quot;In Petőfi&#x27;s Memory&quot;) in his honour. Liszt has also set several of Petőfi&#x27;s poems to music.

In 1911, a statue of Sándor Petőfi was erected in Pressburg (Pozsony, present-day Bratislava), on the Main Square. In 1918, after the army of the newly independent First Czechoslovak Republic occupied the city, the statue was dynamited. After this sculpture was boarded over round temporarily until its removal, and replaced with a statue of Slovak poet Pavol Országh Hviezdoslav. Today, there is a statue of Petőfi in the Medic Garden (Medická záhrada).

The Hungarian composer Jenő Hubay wrote his Petőfi Symphony to celebrate the 1923 centenary of the poet&#x27;s birth; the symphony was also performed in 2023 (the 200th anniversary of the poet&#x27;s birth).

During the late 1940s, Boris Pasternak produced acclaimed translations of Petőfi&#x27;s poems into the Russian language.

Today, schools, streets and squares are named after him throughout Hungary and Hungarian-speaking regions of neighbouring states; in Budapest alone, there are 11 Petőfi streets and 4 Petőfi squares, see: Public place names of Budapest. A national radio station (Radio Petőfi), a bridge in Budapest and a street in Sofia, Bulgaria also bear his name, as well as the asteroid 4483 Petöfi, a member of the Hungaria family. Every Hungarian primary school child learns some of his poems by heart .

The Hungarian 10 Forint banknote valid between 1947 and 1992 depicted Sándor Petőfi on the obverse.

Petőfi has a larger than life terra cotta statue near the Pest end of Erzsébet Bridge, sculpted by Miklós Izsó and . Similar Petőfi statues were established in many other cities, as well, during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
Hugó Meltzl was who made well known the works of Sándor Petőfi in abroad.
In Uzhhorod, Ukraine, there is a city square named after Sándor Petőfi, in Oradea, Romania, a street and a park, and in Tarnów, Poland a Petőfi Memorial Square with a hand-carved Székely gate leading to Petőfi&#x27;s bust.

==In popular culture==
Since 29 June 2021, Petőfi has appeared as a recurring historical character living in modern-day England in The Family Histories Podcast series. He is voiced by the Hungarian children&#x27;s author and illustrator, John Spike. His presence is explained by the host Andrew Martin as due to a &quot;simple miscalculated accident with his kitchen&quot; – a reference to Petőfi&#x27;s 1843 poem &quot;&quot; (I turned into the kitchen), and the time machine used at the end of each podcast episode.

<text>Thief of Time is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 26th book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It was the last Discworld novel with a cover by Josh Kirby.

==Plot summary==
The Auditors hire young clockmaker Jeremy Clockson to build a perfect glass clock, without telling him that this will stop time and thereby eliminate human unpredictability from the universe. Death discovers their plans, but cannot act against them directly, so he instead sends his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit. Meanwhile, Lu-Tze of the History Monks leads gifted young apprentice Lobsang Ludd in a desperate mission.

==Characters==
*Myria LeJean
*Death – the anthropomorphic personification of Death, or Grim Reaper, a recurring and popular character in the Discworld series.
*Jeremy Clockson – a master clockmaker tasked with creating the perfect clock, whose name is a pun on British broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson.
*Susan Sto Helit – Death&#x27;s granddaughter.
*Lu-Tze – a powerful member of the History Monks masquerading as a humble sweeper.
*Lobsang Ludd – apprentice of Lu-Tze

==Reception==
&quot;Thief of Time&quot; was shortlisted for the 2002 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.

At &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Sam Jordison called it &quot;as complicated, daft, hilarious and satisfying as vintage P. G. Wodehouse: part kung fu epic, part philosophical novel, part mind-bending experiment with chaos theory (and a piss-take of those three things)&quot;, and categorized it as a book to &quot;give (readers) hope&quot;. At the &quot;SF Site&quot;, Steven H Silver observed that the book&#x27;s parodying of action films is &quot;masterful&quot;, and commended Pratchett for how &quot;fresh&quot; the humor was—while conceding that &quot;reader(s) may not laugh out loud ... but there will be plenty of internal chuckling&quot;.

At &quot;Infinity Plus&quot;, John Grant noted that it has &quot;fewer moments of uproarious humour than&quot; the majority of Pratchett&#x27;s oeuvre, and that the &quot;narrative fails to engender any sense of urgency in the places where it should&quot;, concluding that although &quot;one could swiftly lay hands on a dozen genre-fantasy novels that are less worthwhile&quot;, it was not Pratchett&#x27;s best work.

==Writing process==

During a 2011 interview, Pratchett discussed his process for writing, and mentioned a self-invented goddess of writers called Narrativia, whom he believed to be smiling upon him throughout his career. One example of Narrativia&#x27;s intervention from &quot;Thief Of Time&quot; was the naming of a key character, Ronnie Soak, the forgotten fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Pratchett stated that he had picked the name at random, and was later &quot;astonished when he noticed what it sounded like backwards. Suddenly, he knew of what this particular horseman would be a harbinger.&quot; In a direct quote Pratchett revealed his satisfaction with this coincidence, &quot;I thought chaos – yes! Chaos, the oldest. Stuff just turns up like that.&quot;

<text>Chigwell School is a co-educational independent boarding and day school. It is a private school in Chigwell, in the Epping Forest district of Essex. It consists of a Pre Prep (ages 4–7), Prep School (ages 7–11), Senior School (ages 11–16) and Sixth Form. A pre-preparatory department for children aged 4–7 was constructed starting for the 2013–14 academic year.

The school is situated in 100 acres of land between Epping Forest and Hainault Forest, ten miles from London. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC) and the Junior School is a member of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS).

The school motto is &quot;aut viam inveniam aut faciam&quot;, a Latin phrase which translates literally as “Find a way or make a way”.

There are four day houses, named Caswall&#x27;s, Lambourne, Penn&#x27;s, and Swallow&#x27;s after alumni. The school owns several artifacts which belonged to each of the alumni after which the houses are named. The boarding houses are Church House, Harsnett&#x27;s, Sandon Lodge, and Hainault House, although all boarders are members of one of the day houses. In the Prep School there are another four houses, named Windsors, Hanovers, Stuarts, and Tudors.

== History ==

Chigwell School dates back to 1619 when a schoolhouse was erected on the site. The first headmaster Peter Mease was appointed in 1623. It was formally founded in 1629 by Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, and began with 16 &quot;poor, clever&quot; scholars.

In 1868, the school was split into two sections. The English section for local children studying arithmetic, reading and writing was housed in a building behind the King&#x27;s Head public house, which was mentioned in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of &#x27;Eighty&quot;. The Latin section (for Latin scholars only) remained in the original building. Rather unusually for a boys&#x27; school at that time, in 1873, it started a bursary programme for girls to attend other schools.

Following a trend set by many HMC schools (which were mainly all-boys), the Sixth Form section became coeducational and its first girls were admitted in the summer term of 1974. In 1997 coeducation was extended to the rest of the school.

== Chapel ==

The War Memorial Chapel was dedicated by the Bishop of Chelmsford on 10 October 1924 to the 78 Old Boys and one Master who had lain down their lives in the Great War and on each side of the altar, plaques record the names of the dead. There were only a total of 80 boys attending the school in 1914. Reginald Hallward took the theme of the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; for the windows of the chapel. He depicted schoolboys as Christian&#x27;s companions on his pilgrimage.

<doc id="552368" wikidata="Q5028199" url="?curid=552368" title="Campbellite">
<text>Campbellite is a mildly pejorative term referring to adherents of certain religious groups that have historic roots in the Restoration Movement, among whose most prominent 19th-century leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell. 

==Influence of the Campbells==
Thomas and Alexander Campbell were the most prominent leaders of the Disciples of Christ movement of the early 19th century. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement). Other prominent individuals in the Restoration Movement included Barton W. Stone, Walter Scott and &quot;Raccoon&quot; John Smith.

==Historically associated groups==
Over time, strains grew within the Restoration Movement. In 1906, the U.S. Religious Census listed the Christian Churches and the Churches of Christ as separate and distinct groups for the first time. This, however, was simply the recognition of a division that had been growing for years, with published reports as early as 1883. The most obvious distinction between the two groups was the rejection of musical instruments in the Churches of Christ. The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860 with the introduction of organs in some churches. More basic were differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church, and they could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. For the Christian Churches, any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered. The major groups with historical roots in the movement are:
*The Churches of Christ 
*The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
*The Christian churches and churches of Christ

The term &quot;Campbellite&quot; is most often applied to the more conservative branches of the movement, including the Churches of Christ and the Christian churches and churches of Christ.

==Term==
Members of these groups generally consider the term &quot;Campbellite&quot; inappropriate, saying that they are followers of Jesus, not Campbell. They draw parallels with Martin Luther&#x27;s protest of the name &quot;Lutherans&quot; and the Anabaptists&#x27; protest of the name given to them by their enemies. With specific reference to the early Restoration Movement, &quot;[t]he terms Campbellism and Campbellites were universally rejected by those to whom they were applied.&quot;

== Popular culture ==
A Campbellite family is featured in Chapter IX of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955).

<doc id="552374" wikidata="Q7772882" url="?curid=552374" title="The Vision of the Anointed">
<text>The Vision of the Anointed (1995) is a book by economist and political columnist Thomas Sowell which brands people and organizations that he calls &quot;the anointed&quot; as &quot;promoters of a worldview concocted out of fantasy impervious to any real-world considerations&quot;.
Sowell asserts that these thinkers, writers, and activists continue to be revered even in the face of evidence disproving their positions.

Sowell argues that American thought is dominated by a &quot;prevailing vision&quot; which seals itself off from any empirical evidence that is inconsistent with that vision.

The book challenges people Sowell refers to as &quot;Teflon prophets,&quot; who predict that there will be future social, economic, or environmental problems in the absence of government intervention (Ralph Nader is one of his foremost examples).

The book was initially published in 1995 by Basic Books. It was described as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; by Nick Cater.

<doc id="552377" wikidata="Q5615741" url="?curid=552377" title="Latrine">
<text>A latrine is a toilet or an even simpler facility that is used as a toilet within a sanitation system. For example, it can be a communal trench in the earth in a camp to be used as emergency sanitation, a hole in the ground (pit latrine), or more advanced designs, including pour-flush systems.

The term &quot;latrine&quot; is still commonly used military parlance, and less so in civilian usage except in emergency sanitation situations. Nowadays, the word &quot;toilet&quot; is more commonly used than &quot;latrine&quot;, except when referring to simple systems like &quot;pit latrines&quot; or &quot;trench latrines&quot;.

The use of latrines was a major advancement in sanitation over more basic practices such as open defecation, and helped control the spread of many waterborne diseases. However, unsafe defecation in unimproved latrines still remained a widespread problem by the end of 2020, with more than 3 billion people affected (46 % of the global population). Eradication of this public health threat is one of the United Nations&#x27; 17 goals for sustainable development.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;latrine&quot; is derived from the Latin , meaning bath. Today it is commonly used in the term &quot;pit latrine&quot;. It has the connotation of something being less advanced and less hygienic than a standard toilet . It is typically used to describe communal facilities, such as the shallow-trench latrines used in emergency sanitation situations, e.g. after earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters.

== Types ==

Many forms of latrine technology have been used, from very simple to more complex. The more sophisticated the system, the more likely that the term &quot;toilet&quot; is used instead of &quot;latrine&quot;.

=== Pit latrine ===

A pit latrine is a simple and inexpensive toilet, minimally defined as a hole (pit) in the ground. More sophisticated pit latrines may include a floor plate, or ventilation to reduce odor and fly and mosquito breeding (called ventilated improved pit latrine or &quot;VIP latrine&quot;). Many military units, if intended for extended use, place basic shelters and seating over the pits. A pit is typically sited well away from any water sources to minimize possible contamination. After prolonged use, a pit is typically buried.

Other types of pit latrines may include the Reed Odourless Earth Closet, the arborloo or treebog (very simple types of composting toilet), or the twin pit pour-flush pit latrine, popularized by Sulabh International.

The shelter that covers such a pit latrine is known in some varieties of English as an outhouse.

=== Trench latrine ===
In a location without longer term sanitation infrastructure, such as for emergency sanitation, a trench latrine is a workable solution. It typically consists of a pit or a trench in the ground, deep and long.

====Slit-trench latrine====
A slit-trench latrine consists of a relatively shallow trench which is narrow enough to stand with one leg on either side (see defecation postures). This type of latrine is used either by squatting, with the users&#x27; legs straddling the pit, or by various arrangements for sitting or leaning against a support structure. Such support may be simply a log, plank, branch or similar arrangement placed at right angles to the long axis of the pit. This type of latrine is not commonly found in developing countries, but can be used for emergency sanitation.

====Shallow-trench latrine====
The shallow-trench latrine is similar to the slit-trench latrine but is wider ( wide) than the latter. It is also shallow, with a depth of about . This type of latrine is often used in the initial phases of emergencies and is a simple improvement on open defecation fields. A rule of thumb in emergency sanitation provision is to allow of land per person per day. This means per 10,000 people per day, or nearly two hectares per week. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s areas should always be separated.

=== Aqua privy ===
An aqua privy is essentially a small septic tank located directly below a dry toilet squatting pan or bowl which has a drop pipe extending below the liquid level in the tank to form a simple water seal to minimise odors.

===Most basic===
* Campers refer to a cathole – a one-use, shallow scrape.
* Bucket

==See also==
* Emergency sanitation
* Reredorter, medieval monastic latrine

<doc id="552381" wikidata="Q724525" url="?curid=552381" title="Coastal Athletic Association">
<text>The Coastal Athletic Association (CAA), formerly the ECAC South Conference and the Colonial Athletic Association, is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA&#x27;s Division I whose full members are located in East Coast states, from Massachusetts to South Carolina. Most of its members are public universities, and the conference is headquartered in Richmond. The CAA was historically a Southern conference until the addition of four schools in the Northeastern United States (of five that joined from rival conference America East) after the turn of the 21st century, which added geographic balance to the conference.

The CAA was founded in 1979 as the ECAC South Conference, made up of independent schools which played basketball in the Eastern College Athletic Conference&#x27;s South Region Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. During its first two seasons, its members continued to play basketball as independents during the regular season and take part in the ECAC&#x27;s South Region tournament for independents, but it began conference play in basketball in the 1981–1982 season. It was renamed the Colonial Athletic Association in 1985 when it added championships in other sports (although a number of members maintain ECAC affiliation in some sports). As of 2006, it organizes championships in 21 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports. The addition of Northeastern University in 2005 gave the conference the NCAA minimum of six football programs needed to sponsor football. For the 2007 football season, all of the Atlantic 10 Conference&#x27;s football programs joined the CAA football conference, as agreed in May 2005. The football league operates under CAA administration as the legally separate entity of CAA Football.

The most recent changes to the conference membership took place in 2022 and 2023. First, Hampton University, Monmouth University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, and Stony Brook University joined in 2022. Stony Brook, already a member of CAA Football, joined in other sports at that time; Hampton and Monmouth joined both the all-sports CAA and CAA Football; and NC A&amp;T joined the all-sports CAA in 2022 and joined CAA Football in 2023. This was followed by Campbell University joining both sides of the league in 2023. The conference renamed itself the Coastal Athletic Conference in 2023.

==History==

The CAA has expanded in recent years, following the exits of longtime members such as the United States Naval Academy, the University of Richmond, East Carolina University, and American University. In 2001, the six-member conference added four additional universities: Towson University, Drexel University, Hofstra University, and the University of Delaware. Four years later the league expanded again when Georgia State University and Northeastern University joined, further enlarging the conference footprint. Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) left for the Atlantic 10 Conference in July 2012. More changes came in 2013: Old Dominion University left for Conference USA, Georgia State joined the Sun Belt Conference, and the College of Charleston joined the CAA from the Southern Conference.

On the playing field, the CAA has produced 16 national team champions in six different sports (the most recent being the James Madison University Dukes who won the 2018 Division I Women&#x27;s Lacrosse championship), 33 individual national champions, 11 national coaches of the year, 11 national players of the year and 12 Honda Award winners. In 2006, George Mason became the first CAA team to reach the Final Four. In 2011, the VCU Rams became the second CAA team to reach the Final Four, as well as the first team to win five games en route, due to their participation in the First Four round.

On March 25, 2013, George Mason University left the CAA to join the Atlantic 10 Conference. Shortly after, the CAA ceased sponsorship of wrestling due to the lack of teams.

The 2015–16 basketball season saw the conference RPI reach its highest rating when it finished the season ranked 9th in the nation.

During another phase of realignment that started in 2021, the CAA was affected when longtime member James Madison University announced it would leave the CAA, transition its football program to the Football Bowl Subdivision, and join the Sun Belt Conference (SBC). Initially, JMU was to join the SBC in July 2023. However, the timeline changed when the CAA chose to ban JMU from subsequent championship events, citing a conference bylaw that allows it to impose such a ban on a departing member. Thus, JMU officially joined the Sun Belt in July 2022 instead (at which time it was counted as an FBS member for scheduling purposes after meeting an NCAA minimum requirement of five FBS opponents at home), housing all of its sports in that league, including men&#x27;s soccer, which would be sponsored by the SBC again, but one season earlier.

Shortly before JMU announced its departure, it was reported that the CAA sought to expand by several schools, allowing it to split into a divisional format for most of its sports in order to reduce travel costs for its members. Among the schools named as possible candidates were Fairfield University, Howard University, Monmouth University, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. In January 2022, reports emerged that Hampton University, a historically black institution that had been working toward a CAA move since at least 1995, would likely join the CAA that July. Monmouth was again named as a potential CAA expansion candidate. Also, Stony Brook University, already a member of CAA Football, was named as a candidate for membership in the all-sports CAA. On January 18, local media in Monmouth&#x27;s home of New Jersey reported that a CAA invitation to that school was imminent.

The CAA later announced on January 25 that Hampton, Monmouth, and Stony Brook would become members of the all-sports CAA that July, with Hampton and Monmouth joining Stony Brook in CAA Football. On February 22, the CAA announced that North Carolina A&amp;T State University would join the all-sports CAA that July and CAA Football in 2023. Still later, Campbell University was announced as a new member of both sides of the league effective in 2023.

On July 20, 2023, the Colonial Athletic Association rebranded as the Coastal Athletic Association, citing the expansion of the conference footprint throughout the east coast for the change in name; however, the current logo was unchanged.

On November 28, 2023, Delaware announced its departure from the CAA and transition to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) joining Conference USA on July 1, 2025.

<text>Alajuela () is a province of Costa Rica. It is located in the north-central part of the country, bordering Nicaragua to the north. It also borders the provinces of Heredia to the east, San José to the south, Puntarenas to the southwest and Guanacaste to the west. As of 2011, the province had a population of 885,571. Alajuela is composed of 16 cantons, which are divided into 111 districts. It covers an area of 9,757.53 square kilometers.

The provincial capital is Alajuela. Other large cities include Quesada, Aguas Zarcas, Naranjo, Zarcero, Orotina, Sarchí Norte, Upala, San Ramón, Grecia and Los Chiles.

==Provincial history==

===Pre-Columbia and the arrival of the Spanish===
Costa Rica has been inhabited for nearly 10,000 years, but little is known of its pre-Columbian history. Alajuela was occupied by several indigenous groups just before the arrival of the Spanish. Despite being between two major civilizations, indigenous groups sparsely populated the area. The Hueteres lived in the south of the territory, while the Botos, Guatusos, Tices and Catapas lived in the north. In the 15th century, most of the region of modern Alajuela was under the control of Garabito, an indigenous leader of whom little is known. Only the Botos, who lived in Alajuela&#x27;s northern plains, resisted conquest until the early 1800s.

Starting in the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Central Valley from Guanacaste. The natives who survived epidemics and conquest were placed in the encomienda system of labor, which exploited natives and funneled money to the Spanish Crown. In 1574, the first reservation for natives was created at Santa Catalina, the Canton of Mateo.

===Founding Alajuela===

Because land holdings in Cartago, the colonial capital of the region, were already controlled by large encomiendas, many settlers began moving west beginning in the mid-1600s. In 1657, Alajuela was mentioned for the first time in the writings of Juana de Vera y Sotomayor, a traveler who described an encomienda &quot;on La Lajuela river.&quot; Before taking on the name of Alajuela, the area was known as Villahermosa.

Esteban Lorenzo de Tristán, Bishop of Nicaragua, Nicoya, and Costa Rica, tried organizing Catholic communities west of Heredia. In doing so, he inaugurated a small oratory to unite the scattered settlers. The oratory was centered in the village of &quot;La Lajuela,&quot; between the Ciruelas and Alajuela rivers. Because of its creation, the city of Alajuela was officially founded on 12 October 1782. In 1790, the first official parish of Alajuela was established, led by the priest Manuel López del Corral. The creation of a parish brought more settlers to the region. Soon, they began moving further and further toward the edges of the Central Valley, founding Atenas in 1836, San Ramón in 1854, and Grecia in 1856. Soon, the cities of Naranjo, Zarcero, and Quesada were founded as well.

===National independence===

In 1823, during the First Costa Rican Civil War, Costa Rica was divided into two groups: the Imperialists, who were loyal to the First Mexican Empire, and the Republicans, who wanted independence. For the most part, Alajuela and San José fought against the coup staged by the Republicans in Heredia and Cartago. The Alajuelan side won. Costa Rica left the Mexican Empire shortly before it dissolved. While Costa Rica was a member of the Federal Republic of Central America in the 1830s, the city of Alajuela was the nation&#x27;s capital.

In 1831, Alajuelan folk hero Juan Santamaría was born. Santamaría was a peasant boy who volunteered as a drummer during the Campaign of 1856-1857. On 11 April 1856, Santamaría sacrificed himself to burn filibuster William Walker&#x27;s stronghold at Santa Rosa, asking only that his mother be taken care of.

Settlement of the northern portion of Alajuela only began in earnest in the latter half of the 19th century and did not reach grand proportions until the second half of the 20th century, owing mainly to the difficult access. Much of the original colonization came from Nicaragua since numerous navigable rivers flow north from their origins in the cordilleras and empty into either Lake Nicaragua or the San Juan River. By 1850, the province had a population of approximately 15,540.

===20th century===

On 16 February 1921, Pope Benedict XV issued a papal bull that reorganized Alajuela into an Ecclesiastic Province run by the incumbents of two new positions: the Archbishop of Alajuela and the Apostolic Vicar of Limón.

A seminal event in Alajuela&#x27;s history was the 1968 eruption of Volcán Arenal. Residents previously referred to it as Mount Arenal. In the years before the eruption, residents reported rises in groundwater temperature and slight tremors. Beginning on 28 July 1969, residents of surrounding towns reported constant tremors. The eruptions began on 29 July, spewing ash into the neighboring provinces and launching boulders into the sky. The initial explosions were so strong that three craters were instantaneously created. The cities of Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo, and San Luís were buried, killing 87 people. Crops were destroyed, and livestock killed.

In 1979, Lake Arenal was created as the result of the construction of a hydroelectric dam by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, Costa Rica&#x27;s national electric company. The old cities of Tabacón and Tronadora were submerged, and residents moved to the new town of Tabacón at its current location, although the church&#x27;s steeple can still be seen. The dam produces 17% of the country&#x27;s electricity.

==Geography==

The province is located in the North Central Plains and borders Nicaragua (Departamento de Rivas, Departamento del Río San Juan) to the north and the Costa Rican provinces of Heredia to the east, San José to the south, and Guanacaste to the west. Alajuela&#x27;s San Carlos (canton) is larger than the provinces of Heredia and Cartago. It is the largest canton in Costa Rica, occupying 34.32% of the provincial territory and 6.55% of the national territory.

===Mountains===

The Central Mountain Range (Cordillera Central de Costa Rica) passes through the province&#x27;s borders, as do the Tilarán and Guanacaste ranges. This province is also home to the two most active Costa Rican Volcanoes: Poás Volcano and the Arenal Volcano.

===Rivers===

In the northern plains, the San Carlos and Frío rivers drain to the San Juan River basin that separates Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The Tárcoles River, which flows to the Gulf of Nicoya, is known for its crocodile population.

===Waterfalls===
* Cataratas del Toro
* La Paz
* La Fortuna
* Los Chorros

==Environment==

Although several ecosystems exist in the province, the Llanuras del Norte (Northern Plains) and the Central Valley highlands are two distinct divisions. The Llanuras del Norte stretch across several provinces, while the Central Valley highlands encompass the middle region of the country. Alajuela&#x27;s natural environment is one of the primary motivators for tourists coming to the country.

===Flora and fauna===

Costa Rica is a biodiversity hotspot and Alajuela is no exception. Thousands of species are native to the province.

Nearly a third of the country&#x27;s 1,400 types of orchids can be found in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, which straddles the border between Alajuela and Guanacaste.

Birds such as the quetzal, scarlet macaw, hummingbird, woodpecker, kingfisher, toucan, and three-wattled bellbird are native to Alajuela. There are many species of bats as well, like the spectral bat, Honduran white bat, and the thumbless bat. Many species of insects, including butterflies and moths, are native to Alajuela. Because of this, The Butterfly Farm in La Garita was established to further scientific research into the different species.

The white-headed capuchin is native to the forests of the province, as is the mantled howler. Other mammals native to Alajuela include Baird&#x27;s tapir, the giant anteater, the silky anteater, margays, ocelots, and other wild cats. Jaguars, while rarely seen, also inhabit the province&#x27;s national parks. Deer are native to the highlands and the Northern Plains.

Machaca and bass are two fish found throughout the province. In addition, there are many other species of invertebrates and amphibians.

===Climate===

Temperature extremes in Alajuela range from 36.6 Fahrenheit (2.6 Celsius) to 95.6 Fahrenheit (35.2 Celsius). The year is generally split into two periods: the dry season, or summer, which goes from December to April, and the rainy season, or winter, from May until November. The winter corresponds with the Atlantic hurricane season, so rain can be a daily part of Alajuelan life. The highlands and the Northern Plains can vary significantly in temperature and precipitation.


==Economy==
===Agriculture===

The base of the Alajuela&#x27;s economy remains agricultural production. In the southern highlands of the province, tropical ornamentals, coffee, tubers, and green vegetables are the major crops. Rice, corn, pineapple, bananas, and sugarcane are important crops in the north and northeast. Alajuela ranks first nationwide in national coffee production and national sugar cane production. Many of the agricultural products are exported overseas.

This region has large pastoral areas, especially in the San Carlos area, where there is a significant cattle ranching sector. The cattle industry has spawned production in leather, milk, and dairy products and beef production. The municipality of Upala serves as a supply center for cattle ranchers north of the province. Naranjo, so named because &quot;Naranjo&quot; means orange in Spanish, produces oranges largely for domestic consumption. For a short time in the 1800s, tobacco was a cash crop in the Palmares region, although its production has dropped. There is growing small-scale organic farming industry in Alajuela.

===Industry and commerce===
In recent years, Alajuela has attracted many export-orientated manufacturing companies, especially within the free trade zones around the municipality of Alajuela. Free trade zones include Coyol, Saret, Montecillos, and Bes, among others. Alajuela&#x27;s free trade zones are primarily industrial. The increase in manufacturing, which began in earnest in 2004, has created strains on the province&#x27;s infrastructure, including water distribution, transportation density, and electric output. When a hydroelectric plant was constructed in Grecia in 2012, construction upstarts doubled within two months. Industry-related construction accounted for the largest growth. Major companies in these zones include medical equipment manufacturers like Allergan, Baxter, Hospira, and Boston Scientific.

Costa Rican lactate conglomerate Dos Pinos is headquartered in Alajuela. Cooperativa de Productores de Leche Dos Pinos exports products throughout Latin America and began exporting to China in 2013. Bebidas Florida, a drink manufacturer with a license to bottle Coca-Cola products, is also headquartered in Alajuela. Other businesses in the province include a butterfly egg and larvae exporter.

Several major banks are headquartered in the Alajuela province, including Grupo Mutual Alajuela and the Costa Rican branches of Scotiabank, HSBC, Banco Cathay, and Citibank. Grupo Mutual Alajuela maintains a secure banking center in the province. There is a large, modern mall in Alajuela close to the Juan Santamaría International Airport where many international brands maintain branches. A Honduran construction firm is constructing another mall.

===Tourism===

Alajuela has a well-developed tourist sector throughout the province. Tourism is promoted by the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (ICT) (Costa Rican Tourism Institute). However, some Alajuelan politicians would like to see a separate bureau for Alajuela. Alajuela has various national parks including Poás Volcano National Park, Arenal Volcano National Park, Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park, Juan Castro Blanco National Park, Los Ángeles Cloud Forest, and Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge, as well as other reserves and protected areas.

Some of the province&#x27;s tourist industry is centered around La Fortuna, a small town at the base of Arenal Volcano. There, tourists can visit Arenal Eco Zoo, hot spring resorts, tour a large lake below the volcano, go fishing, and visit nature reserves. The Tabacón hot springs, which reach temperatures up to 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), are a popular destination for national and international tourists.

Other tourist centers in Alajuela include La Marina Wildlife Rescue Center, Zarcero, and a town known for its public topiary garden. Starting in the 1960s, gardener Evangelisto Blanco began transforming the bushes and cypress trees in Francisco Alvarado Park in the center of town. The town maintains Blanco&#x27;s tradition and is now attractive. In Sarchí, national and international tourists can visit the country&#x27;s traditional artisan shops. Geometrically painted oxcarts, furniture and other crafts are some of the artisanal products built in Sarchí. In the municipality of Palmares, there is a large festival every January. The festival has been going on since 1987 and has live music, horse parades, and other traditional events that attract nearly 20,000 visitors each year. Many visitors and businesses go to San Carlos in April each year for an annual cattle market. Grecia is a common stop for tourists traveling from the Central Valley to the Pacific Coast because of El Mundo de los Serpientes (The World of Snakes), a snake zoo and breeding center founded in 1994.

The municipality of Alajuela is also a major tourist attraction. The city&#x27;s center is a centuries-old cathedral with a plaza where mangoes regularly fall from the trees. Known as &quot;The City of Mangoes,&quot; there is a mango festival each June. Next to the plaza, there is a museum dedicated to folk hero Juan Santamaría. This museum is in the old Alajuela Prison building. As of 1999, it encompasses the old city armory, both buildings constructed in the second half of the 19th century. One wing of that museum revives the history behind the Battle of Santa Rosa between Costa Rica and American filibusterer William Walker in 1856, while other sections feature relics and displays from around the country. The museum also portrays the local culture, dedicating a team to local artisans and their works and public theater events such as plays and lectures.

There are many attractions in La Garita and La Guacima, west of the municipality of Alajuela. The Rescate Wildlife Rescue Center (formerly Rescate Animal Zoo Ave), established in 1990, is a bird rehabilitation and breeding center where visitors can view and learn about rare birds. There is also the Botanical Orchid Garden which houses dozens of species of orchids, as well as other plants native to the region. The Butterfly Farm in La Guacima, is another tourist attraction that also exports butterfly eggs and species to scientists and researchers around the world. A popular destination on weekends, many Costa Ricans travel to this region to buy stone ornaments and decorative plants.

==Culture and people==

===Literature===

Alajuela takes a central place in Costa Rica&#x27;s literary tradition, evidenced by the numerous authors raised in the country and their commitment to public libraries. There are 14 public libraries in Alajuela, more than any other province in the country. The University of Costa Rica maintains children&#x27;s literature outreach centers primarily in Alajuela, in Grecia, San Ramón, Naranjo, Palmares and Zarcero. The municipality of Alajuela frequent holds storytelling contests and festivals, as well.

Because of its rich literary tradition, San Ramón is often called &quot;la Tierra de las poetas&quot; (&quot;land of poets&quot;). Many poets and authors were born in the San Ramón area, including José Joaquín Salas Pérez, Carlomagno Araya, Ema Gamboa, and Feliz Ángel Salas. San Ramón&#x27;s favorite son is often listed as Lisímaco Chavarría. Born in 1878, Chavarría&#x27;s romantic and naturalist poetry brought him into correspondence with many well-known Latin American authors, such as Rubén Darío, José Enrique Rodó and Joaquín García Monge. Born in 1915, author and naturalist illustrator Rafael Lucas Rodríguez was a pioneering biologist in the country. He wrote numerous articles, books, and illustrative tracts of Costa Rican flora. Author Fernando Contreras Castro, also born and raised in San Ramón, is an internationally recognized author writing in what is described as the &quot;urban generation&quot; style. Contreras teaches literature at the University of Costa Rica.

Social realist Fabián Dobles grew up in Atenas. Dobles&#x27; work concentrates on the plight of people experiencing poverty in Costa Rica. Dobles, a member of the Popular Vanguard Party, later spent time in prison for his political beliefs. Author Carlos Luis Fallas was born and educated in Alajuela. Fallas&#x27; most well-known work, &quot;Mamita Yunai,&quot; was based on his time working on a banana plantation. Historian and journalist Ángela Ulibarri lives in Ciudad Quesada. Contemporary playwright Jorge Arroyo also grew up in Alajuela. His work has been staged in half-a-dozen countries.

===Indigenous peoples===

Most of the indigenous tribes of Alajuela were killed during Spanish colonization, although the Botos held out until the mid-1800s. Today, the Maleku are among the only indigenous tribes left from the Spanish colonial period. Their reserve is in northern Alajuela, an hour north of La Fortuna at San Rafael de Guatuso. There are three Maleku villages near Guatuso: Palenque Sol, Palenque Tonjibe, and Palenque Margarita, where residents subsist largely from the tourist economy.

===Education===

There are many higher-level educational centers in the province. Universidad Técnica Nacional de Costa Rica (UTN) (Technical University of Costa Rica) is the most well-known. UTN was founded in 2008 due to the merger of several colleges. It is the fifth public university in the country and maintains five campuses, including three in Alajuela at San Carlos, Atenas, and close to the municipality of Alajuela. The Instituto Centroamericano de Administración de Empresas (INCAE) (Central American Institute for Business Administration) has a campus in La Garita. INCAE was founded with the help of US during the Cold War with the intention of promoting business education in Central America. The Universidad Adventista de Centroamérica (UAC) (Central American Adventist University) is a private Adventist university in Ceiba. The Universidad Santa Lucía (Santa Lucia University) has a campus in the municipality of Alajuela and San Carlos. San Carlos also has a branch of the Costa Rica Institute of Technology. Founded in 1995, the Universidad de Ciencias Empresariales (UCEM) Business Science University is also located in Alajuela. In addition, there are other higher learning centers with campuses in Costa Rica, such as the Colegio Universitario Boston (Boston University College), which is not associated with Boston University, and the National Learning Institute (INA).

===Architecture and public art===

Alajuela has a rich and diverse architectural history, reflected in various styles of churches, schools, houses, and public works projects.

The municipality of Grecia is home to the Iglesia de la Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes (Our Lady of Mercy Church), a church constructed almost entirely of sheet metal. The sheet metal was bought by local investors and shipped from Belgium. Today, it is painted dark red. The province is home to many of Costa Rica&#x27;s historic churches, including the gothic church in Sarchí, the neo-classical church of Nuestra Señora de las Piedades (Our Lady of Piety) in Naranjo, the neo-classical church of Templo San José in the municipality of Alajuela, and the wooden church in Venecia. At the beginning of the 1900s, an attempt was made to build a church and monument near the top of Cerro Espíritu Santo (Holy Spirit Mountain) outside of San Miguel de Naranjo. The church was never completed because of frequent tremors and problems financing its construction. Today, the partially constructed church and amphitheater is a popular tourist stop on the way toward Volcán Arenal.

Several schools in the province are also national monuments, including the art deco Escuela Jorge Washington in San Ramón built in 1931, the neo classical Escuela Pedro Aguirre Cerda in Poas, and the neo-colonial Escuela de Hacienda Vieja. The Escuela Central (Central School) of Atenas is national monument, built of galvanized steel. It is an art deco design built in the first half of the 20th century.

In the municipality of Alajuela, there are three well-known churches. The Ermita de la Concepción en El Llano (The Hermitage of Plains Conception) is one of the only remaining adobe and cane churches left in the country. Built in 1881, a project for its restoration began in 2000. The current site of the Central Cathedral of Alajuela was first blessed as a church in 1790. It was expanded in 1813, but replaced with the current Cathedral between 1854 and 1863, designed by Francisco Kurtze. In 1888, the red cupola was added based on designs from Swiss architect Gustavo Casallini, giving the Central Cathedral its distinctive look.

Also in the municipality are several other buildings from the 1800s, built in neo-classical style. They are directly off the central plaza, including the Antigua Carcel (Old Prison), Antigua Gobernación (Old Capital), Templo Metodista &quot;El Mesías&quot; (&quot;Messiah&quot; Methodist Temple), Antiguo Cuartel (Old Barracks), and the neo-classical Antiguo Instituto de Alajuela y Salón de Actos (Old Alajuelan Government Building). Iglesia de la Agonía, built in 1825, is an adobe colonial church with white Spanish style brickwork. The art deco Escuela Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra and Hospital San Rafael are also within the municipality.

The Puente de Las Damas (Ladies&#x27; Bridge), built in 1844, is another national monument in Atenas. Stories differ on the origin of the name. According to many people, construction was organized by well-known &quot;high society&quot; women, including the widow of former head-of-state Manuel Fernández Chacón, Dolores Oreamuno. Other sources claim the name comes from the nearby planting of cestrum nocturnum, which is often called &quot;lady of the night&quot; in Spanish. In 1853, German traveler Wilhelm Marr commented that the bridge was a &quot;spectacular mix of nature and art.&quot; Reconstructed, the bridge still stands on the old highway to Puntarenas, providing an avenue for farmers to transport coffee to the Pacific coast, as it did in the past. Outside of Grecia, El Puente de Piedra (the Stone Footbridge) has given rise to so many folk-tales and legends that it is also a national monument. It is a natural formation that has been complemented to allow visitors to traverse.

There are many examples of public art in the province—several statues dedicated to national hero Juan Santamaría. The most famous is the municipality of Alajuela, which was supported and initially financed by the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica. Funding for the statue was first approved in 1887 and it was built by Aristide Croisy, a French sculptor. The statue and the two cannons next to it were installed in 1891. Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío&#x27;s poem, &quot;¡Bronce al soldado Juan!&quot; was inspired by the statue. Also in the municipality are statues dedicated to Próspero Fernández Oreamuno, José Joaquín Mora Porras, León Fernández Bonilla, Miguel Obregón Lizano, Juan Manuel Meoño Herrera, Santiago Crespo Calvo (outside the Santiago Crespo Retirement Home), and Francisco de Paula Pereira Matamoros. Opposite the airport is the Farmer&#x27;s Park, where the Monumento al Agricultor (Farmer&#x27;s Monument) is located. It was vandalized in 2014 but quickly restored. In addition, there are numerous murals throughout the urban centers of Alajuela, including César Valverde Vega&#x27;s in the Clínica de Alajuela.

Sarchí is home to the world&#x27;s largest ox cart. It is displayed in the central park.

Architect Ibo Bonilla was born in Sarchí. Bonilla designed the Latin American Science and Technology University (ULACIT) and the Ibero American Hospital, among other projects. In addition, Bonilla remodeled the Central Bank of Costa Rica, the International Bank of Costa Rica, and many cultural spots in San José, including the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum.

==Sport==

The municipality of Alajuela is home to the Liga Deportiva Alajuelense, one of Costa Rica&#x27;s most successful soccer clubs. La Liga was founded in 1919 and became a founding member of the Liga Nacional de Fútbol (National Football League) two years later. Between 1928 and 2018, La Liga won 29 national championships. La Liga plays at the Alejandro Morera Soto Stadium, which has served as a national stadium and seats 18,000 spectators.

Frequent Costa Rica First Division teams in the province include Asociación Deportiva Carmelita, which won the national championship in 1961, A.D. San Carlos, and Asociación Deportiva Ramonense. Other teams include Municipal Grecia, Selección de Cacao, Municipal Santa Ana, Sarchí, Selección de Canoas, Higuiteña, Upala (Guatuso), and COFUTPA Palmarés. Club Deportivo Alajuela Junior existed between 1933 and 1936.

Bullfighting in Costa Rica is less dangerous for animals than in other parts of the world, and Alajuela is no exception. Every January in Palmares, bullfighting is the center of the city&#x27;s annual festival. In 2013, an amateur rodeo clown was killed while trying to annoy the bulls in the Palmares bullfighting ring. The speedway track in La Guacima is often the site of such bullfighting events. Other smaller events are staged at festivals throughout the province.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Costa Rica&#x27;s busiest airport is in southern Alajuela. The Aeropuerto Internacional Juan Santamaría (Juan Santamaría International Airport) is the second busiest airport in Central America. There are other local airports in La Fortuna, Los Chiles, and Upala.

Asphalted roads connect the major cities in Alajuela, be they highways or secondary. The General Cañas Highway connects the municipality of Alajuela to San José and was the subject of national ridicule when a sinkhole temporarily closed it in 2012, causing enormous traffic problems throughout the metropolitan region. The Colon of Mora to Orotina connects Orotina to San José. The Pan-American Highway runs through the province.

In 1926, Alajuela was the scene of one of the worst railroad disasters in history. High above the Virilla River, a train carrying pilgrims to the Virgen de los Ángeles derailed, killing 248 passengers and injuring a further 93. Two of Alajuela&#x27;s defunct railroad stations are classified as national monuments: the Estación del Ferrocarril al Pacífico (Pacific Railroad Station) in Orotina and the Antigua Estación del Ferrocarril en Río Grande (Old Río Grande Railroad Station) in Atenas. Río Grande&#x27;s railroad bridge is also a national monument.

President José María Figueres Olsen closed the rail transportation system following damage during an earthquake and external pressure to liberalize the nation&#x27;s resources; however, work is underway to reopen the rails. The Instituto Costarricense de Ferrocarriles (INCOFER) (Costa Rican Railroad Institute) is working to reopen the terminals and rails that link Alajuela and the other cities in the Central Valley. It is scheduled to open in 2014. In 2012, a proposal was made to build a train from Alajuela to Cartago but the project never got underway and was eventually scrapped.

===Health services===

The entire province is serviced through the Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (Caja) (Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance). Cities and towns of significant size have Equipos Básicos de Atención Integral en Salud (EBAIS) (Basic Medical Attention Center) facilities. In addition, one of Costa Rica&#x27;s largest hospitals, Hospital San Rafael, is in the municipality of Alajuela. Grecia is home to the Hospital San Francisco de Asís, built-in 1858 by Ramón Quesada. Hospital Los Chiles is the northernmost hospital in the country. The old hospital in Quesada, built in the first half of the 20th century and no longer in use, is a national monument.

===Other public services===

Like the rest of the country, nearly half of the water services are provided by the Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (AyA) (Costa Rican Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers). Water service did not arrive to the northern city of Upala until 1976, but it was recently bolstered in the cantons of the north of Los Chiles, La Urruca, and Coquitales.

National trash collection is governed by the 8839 Law (Gestión Integral de Residuos Sólidos). The municipalities of Alajuela, Atenas, Grecia, Naranjo, Palmares, Poás, and San Ramón have collective trash removal services.

Electricity did not arrive in the northern part of the province until 1978. Grecia is home to a new hydroelectric plant, constructed in 2012. The hydroelectric dam at Lake Arenal generates between 12% and 17% of the country&#x27;s electricity. There are a growing number of wind turbines that generate electricity in the province, including a plant at Tierras Morenas.

<text>An auditor is a person or a firm appointed by a company to execute an audit. To act as an auditor, a person should be certified by the regulatory authority of accounting and auditing or possess certain specified qualifications. Generally, to act as an external auditor of the company, a person should have a certificate of practice from the regulatory authority.

== Types of auditors ==
* External auditor/ Statutory auditor is an independent firm engaged by the client subject to the audit, to express an opinion on whether the company&#x27;s financial statements are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. 

For publicly traded companies, external auditors may also be required to express an opinion over the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. External auditors may also be engaged to perform other agreed-upon procedures, related or unrelated to financial statements. Most importantly, external auditors, though engaged and paid by the company being audited, should be regarded as independent.

* Internal Auditors are employed by the organizations they audit. They work for government agencies (federal, state and local); for publicly traded companies; and for non-profit companies across all industries. 

The internationally recognised standard setting body for the profession is the Institute of Internal Auditors - IIA (www.theiia.org). The IIA has defined internal auditing as follows: &quot;Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization&#x27;s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes&quot;.

<doc id="552426" wikidata="Q2707253" url="?curid=552426" title="Strophic form">
<text>Strophic form – also called verse-repeating form, [[refrain|chorus]] form, AAA song form, or one-part song form – is a song structure in which all verses or stanzas of the text are sung to the same music. Contrasting song forms include through-composed, with new music written for every stanza, and ternary form, with a contrasting central section.

Strophe is derived from the Greek word (&quot;strophḗ&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;). It is the simplest and most durable of musical forms, extending a piece of music by repetition of a single formal section. This may be analyzed as &quot;A A A...&quot;. This additive method is the musical analogue of repeated stanzas in poetry or lyrics and, in fact, where the text repeats the same rhyme scheme from one stanza to the next, the song&#x27;s structure also often uses either the same or very similar material from one stanza to the next.

A &quot;modified&quot; strophic form varies the pattern in some stanzas (A A&#x27; A&quot;...) somewhat like a rudimentary theme and variations. Contrasting verse-chorus form is a binary form that alternates between two sections of music (ABAB), although this may also be interpreted as constituting a larger strophic verse-refrain form. While the terms &#x27;refrain&#x27; and &#x27;chorus&#x27; are often used interchangeably, &#x27;refrain&#x27; may indicate a recurring line of identical melody and lyrics as a part of the verse (as in &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;: &quot;...the answer my friend...&quot;), while &#x27;chorus&#x27; means an independent form section (as in &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;: &quot;We all live in...&quot;).

Many folk and popular songs are strophic in form, including the twelve-bar blues, ballads, hymns and chants. Examples include &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;, &quot;Erie Canal&quot;, &quot;Michael, Row the Boat Ashore&quot;, and &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot; (A = verse &amp; chorus). Traditional and modern Country songs like &quot;This land is your land&quot; is also a strophic form.

Many classical art songs are also composed in strophic form, from the 17th century French air de cour to 19th century German lieder and beyond. Haydn used the strophic variation form in many of his string quartets and a few of his symphonies, employed almost always in the slow second movement. Franz Schubert composed many important strophic lieder, including settings of both narrative poems and simpler, folk-like texts, such as his &quot;Heidenröslein&quot; and &quot;Der Fischer&quot;. Several of the songs in his song cycle &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; use strophic form.

<text>The ocelot gecko (Paroedura picta) is a crepuscular ground-dwelling gecko found in leaf litter in Madagascar forests and is also a popular pet. It is sometimes known as the Madagascar ground gecko, Malagasy fat-tailed gecko, fat-headed gecko, panther gecko or pictus gecko

== Characteristics ==
&quot;P. picta&quot; naturally occurs as a brown lizard with black markings. Some individuals may also have a white dorsal stripe. In captivity, there are several color phases available including hypo, orange, anerythristic, and amelanistic (yellow).

They usually reach a size of , with some well-cared-for males reaching . Overall, they are smaller than the average gecko. These creatures feature slender, elongated bodies and narrow, pointed heads, and come in a range of colors. The colors usually involve shades of brown, grey, and cream, with markings or spots that resemble ocelot spots. They also have large, rounded eyes with vertical pupils and sticky toe pads that allow them to climb and adhere to surfaces.

The ocelot gecko is not a true climbing gecko, but does have the capability to climb a few surfaces. In captivity, it has been known to scale the sides of glass terrariums if startled.

They are exclusively insectivorous.

They are nocturnal creatures. They spend their days hiding in crevices or under rocks. They are best observed during their preferred hunting time, between dusk and dawn.

== In captivity ==

These geckos do well in captivity but do not like being handled and may bite if scared. They can live in captivity for between six and ten years.

<text>A are a British alternative rock band from Suffolk, England, which formed in 1993. They have released 4 studio and 2 live albums, including their debut &quot;How Ace Are Buildings&quot; and the UK top 20 album &quot;Hi-Fi Serious&quot;. Single releases have also achieved chart success, with one UK top 10, four UK top 40 and seven UK top 100 singles. 

Shortly after releasing their fourth album, &quot;Teen Dance Ordinance&quot;, in 2005, the band briefly split. In 2007 &#x27;A&#x27; reunited for a one-off gig, and have been touring sporadically ever since including playing the main stage at Download Pilot on June 19, 2021. They have not released any further albums since 2005.

==History==
=== Formation, &quot;How Ace Are Buildings&quot; and &quot;A vs. Monkey Kong&quot; (1993–2000) ===
The band began in Suffolk in the mid 1980s as Grand Designs, named after the song by Rush. The founder members were twins Jason and Adam Perry and their friend Mark Chapman, with bassist Stevie Swindon and the twins&#x27; younger brother Giles Perry. They cited Rush, the Beach Boys, Van Halen and the Beastie Boys among their influences.

After changing their name to A in 1993, and abandoning their early progressive rock-inspired sound for a more punk rock style, they signed a European recording contract with Warner Bros. Records UK in 1996 and released their debut LP &quot;How Ace Are Buildings&quot; in 1997. Also in 1997, the band briefly appeared in the music video for &quot;Anthem&quot; by the Wildhearts. A found a healthy underground reception and even had a couple of low-charting singles in the UK.

Although A achieved some recognition with &quot;How Ace Are Buildings&quot;, bassist Stevie Swindon left the band. He was replaced in 1997 by bassist and future BBC Radio 1 Rock Show DJ Daniel P Carter. Swindon went on to establish the award-winning community arts charity, TAPE Community Music and Film in 2008.

A licensing agreement for the American music market was reached with the North Carolina–based Mammoth Records. Future releases would be distributed in the U.S. and Canada by Mammoth.

A&#x27;s second album &quot;A vs. Monkey Kong&quot; followed in 1999. The band then toured the world and enjoyed a small degree of success worldwide, especially in Germany. They released a live album, &quot;Exit Stage Right&quot; in 2000.

===&quot;Hi-Fi Serious&quot; and commercial success (2002) ===
&quot;Hi-Fi Serious&quot; was their third album, released in 2002 and is certified Silver in the UK having sold over 60,000 copies. It was preceded by their biggest single &quot;Nothing&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first and only top ten hit when it reached number 9 in the UK singles chart. &quot;Nothing&quot; was followed by top 20 hit &quot;Starbucks&quot;, named after the coffee chain.

The tour following &quot;Hi-Fi Serious&quot; saw the band playing their largest venues to date, headlining the 5,000 capacity Brixton Academy as part of their Inner-City Sumo Tour. At the end of the year they won the Kerrang! award for Best British Band.

In 2004, their single &quot;Nothing&quot; appeared on Beyblade&#x27;s &quot;Let It Rip!&quot; official soundtrack. In 2007, &quot;Something&#x27;s Going On&quot; and &quot;The Distance&quot; appeared on the Surf&#x27;s Up video game soundtrack.

===&quot;Teen Dance Ordinance&quot; and hiatus (2005) ===
A released their fourth album, &quot;Teen Dance Ordinance&quot; (TDO), on 27 June 2005. The album had been recorded two years earlier, but was heavily delayed due to Jason Perry&#x27;s illness and disputes with the record company. It featured a more straight rock sound and displayed an almost complete absence of the keyboards and sampling that marked the early sound of the band. Unlike their last two albums, &quot;Teen Dance Ordinance&quot; was not released in the US. Hollywood Records agreed early on to release it in the US, but ultimately did not.

Following the release of &quot;Teen Dance Ordinance&quot; in 2005, the band worked on other projects. Jason Perry spent time writing, recording, and touring with Matt Willis, formerly of Busted, and has now become a Grammy award winning producer, working with the likes of the Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, and McFly. Adam Perry and Daniel P Carter briefly became full-time members of the Bloodhound Gang: Perry replaced drummer Willie the New Guy in 2005, and Carter replaced guitarist Lupus Thunder in 2009.

Carter continued writing material with Jason Perry and artists such as McFly, and has hosted BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Rock Show since 25 September 2006.

Mark Chapman went into teaching, and has played in the bands Malpractice, alongside drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass producer Adam F, and &#x27;MiLLS,&#x27; fronted by former Cable drummer Richie Mills. Giles Perry went on work for the BBC, and has also produced videos for Hundred Reasons and Biffy Clyro.

===Reunion (2007–2008) ===
In August 2008, Adam Perry revealed six tour dates supporting the Wildhearts on the band&#x27;s forum, noting that: &quot;This is going to be wicked and we are grateful to the Wildhearts for dragging us from our retirement! Plus there are now big plans afoot to start the new record for next year.&quot;

Bassist Daniel P Carter did not return to the band, however, and John Mitchell, front man of It Bites and producer of bands including Enter Shikari and Funeral for a Friend, filled in for the tour.

=== Later work (2009 – 2022) ===
&#x27;A&#x27; played a 10-date UK tour in December 2009, supported by This City. On 13 May 2010, Bowling For Soup singer Jaret Reddick announced &#x27;A&#x27; as support band for their Autumn tour. &#x27;A&#x27; then announced on their own Twitter on 26 May 2010 that Daniel P. Carter would be returning to the band for this tour. Later that year, Perry and Carter were credited as co-writers of the Subways song &quot;I Wanna Dance With You&quot; from the album &quot;Money &amp; Celebrity&quot;.

&#x27;A&#x27; played a one-off show at the Kasbah nightclub in Coventry on 1 December 2012. In June 2015, they played warm-up concerts in St Albans and Royal Tunbridge Wells before headlining the 4th stage at that year&#x27;s Download Festival. Andrew &quot;Shay&quot; Sheehy, formerly of Kids in Glass Houses, filled in on bass guitar for these shows.
In February 2018, &#x27;A&#x27; embarked on an 8 date UK tour in support of Hell Is for Heroes, joined briefly by McFly bassist Dougie Poynter. and an appearance at Download Festival. In November 2018, the band went on a 9 date tour playing the album Hi-Fi Serious in full, with support from Wheatus and InMe followed by another UK headline tour and appearances at 2000trees and Camden Rocks in summer 2019.

In November 2019, &#x27;A&#x27; band played eight dates in the UK to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album &quot;A vs. Monkey Kong&quot;. The band were joined by Tim HB, formally of Architects (British band) who stepped in on bass guitar for the tour. Support was provided by &#x27;68. 

During 2021, &#x27;A&#x27; performed on the main stage at the Download Festival Pilot event and the rescheduled Slam Dunk Festival.
In April 2022, the band played a warm-up show in Dover before heading out around the UK on 11 dates as main support for Reef. 
=== Make &#x27;A&#x27; Great Again (since 2023) ===

In 2023, there were rumors of new &#x27;A&#x27; material, and during July 2023 social media posts from the individual members began to appear showing the band working on new material in the studio.

<doc id="552466" wikidata="Q1366192" url="?curid=552466" title="System identification">
<text>The field of system identification uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data. System identification also includes the optimal design of experiments for efficiently generating informative data for fitting such models as well as model reduction. A common approach is to start from measurements of the behavior of the system and the external influences (inputs to the system) and try to determine a mathematical relation between them without going into many details of what is actually happening inside the system; this approach is called [[Black box (systems)|black box]] system identification.

== Overview ==
A dynamic mathematical model in this context is a mathematical description of the dynamic behavior of a system or process in either the time or frequency domain. Examples include:

* physical processes such as the movement of a falling body under the influence of gravity;
* economic processes such as international trade markets that react to external influences.

One of the many possible applications of system identification is in control systems. For example, it is the basis for modern data-driven control systems, in which concepts of system identification are integrated into the controller design, and lay the foundations for formal controller optimality proofs.

===Input-output vs output-only===
System identification techniques can utilize both input and output data (e.g. eigensystem realization algorithm) or can include only the output data (e.g. frequency domain decomposition). Typically an input-output technique would be more accurate, but the input data is not always available.

===Optimal design of experiments===

The quality of system identification depends on the quality of the inputs, which are under the control of the systems engineer. Therefore, systems engineers have long used the principles of the design of experiments. In recent decades, engineers have increasingly used the theory of optimal experimental design to specify inputs that yield maximally precise estimators.

==White-, grey-, and black-box==

One could build a white-box model based on first principles, e.g. a model for a physical process from the Newton equations, but in many cases, such models will be overly complex and possibly even impossible to obtain in reasonable time due to the complex nature of many systems and processes.

A more common approach is therefore to start from measurements of the behavior of the system and the external influences (inputs to the system) and try to determine a mathematical relation between them without going into the details of what is actually happening inside the system. This approach is called system identification. Two types of models are common in the field of system identification:

* grey box model: although the peculiarities of what is going on inside the system are not entirely known, a certain model based on both insight into the system and experimental data is constructed. This model does however still have a number of unknown free parameters which can be estimated using system identification. One example uses the Monod saturation model for microbial growth. The model contains a simple hyperbolic relationship between substrate concentration and growth rate, but this can be justified by molecules binding to a substrate without going into detail on the types of molecules or types of binding. Grey box modeling is also known as semi-physical modeling.
* black box model: No prior model is available. Most system identification algorithms are of this type.

In the context of nonlinear system identification Jin et al. describe grey-box modeling by assuming a model structure a priori and then estimating the model parameters. Parameter estimation is relatively easy if the model form is known but this is rarely the case. Alternatively, the structure or model terms for both linear and highly complex nonlinear models can be identified using NARMAX methods. This approach is completely flexible and can be used with grey box models where the algorithms are primed with the known terms, or with completely black-box models where the model terms are selected as part of the identification procedure. Another advantage of this approach is that the algorithms will just select linear terms if the system under study is linear, and nonlinear terms if the system is nonlinear, which allows a great deal of flexibility in the identification.

== Identification for control ==
In control systems applications, the objective of engineers is to obtain a good performance of the closed-loop system, which is the one comprising the physical system, the feedback loop and the controller. This performance is typically achieved by designing the control law relying on a model of the system, which needs to be identified starting from experimental data. If the model identification procedure is aimed at control purposes, what really matters is not to obtain the best possible model that fits the data, as in the classical system identification approach, but to obtain a model satisfying enough for the closed-loop performance. This more recent approach is called identification for control, or I4C in short.

The idea behind I4C can be better understood by considering the following simple example. Consider a system with &quot;true&quot; transfer function formula_1:
:formula_2
and an identified model formula_3:
:formula_4
From a classical system identification perspective, formula_3 is &quot;not&quot;, in general, a &quot;good&quot; model for formula_1. In fact, modulus and phase of formula_3 are different from those of formula_1 at low frequency. What is more, while formula_1 is an asymptotically stable system, formula_3 is a simply stable system. However, formula_3 may still be a model good enough for control purposes. In fact, if one wants to apply a purely proportional negative feedback controller with high gain formula_12, the closed-loop transfer function from the reference to the output is, for formula_1
:formula_14
and for formula_3
:formula_16
Since formula_12 is very large, one has that formula_18. Thus, the two closed-loop transfer functions are indistinguishable. In conclusion, formula_3 is a &quot;perfectly acceptable&quot; identified model for the &quot;true&quot; system if such feedback control law has to be applied. Whether or not a model is &quot;appropriate&quot; for control design depends not only on the plant/model mismatch but also on the controller that will be implemented. As such, in the I4C framework, given a control performance objective, the control engineer has to design the identification phase in such a way that the performance achieved by the model-based controller on the &quot;true&quot; system is as high as possible.

Sometimes, it is even more convenient to design a controller without explicitly identifying a model of the system, but directly working on experimental data. This is the case of &quot;direct&quot; data-driven control systems.

== Forward model ==

A common understanding in Artificial Intelligence is that the controller has to generate the next move for a robot. For example, the robot starts in the maze and then the robot decides to move forward. Model predictive control determines the next action indirectly. The term “model” is referencing to a forward model which doesn&#x27;t provide the correct action but simulates a scenario. A forward model is equal to a physics engine used in game programming. The model takes an input and calculates the future state of the system.

The reason why dedicated forward models are constructed is because it allows one to divide the overall control process. The first question is how to predict the future states of the system. That means, to simulate a plant over a timespan for different input values. And the second task is to search for a sequence of input values which brings the plant into a goal state. This is called predictive control.

The forward model is the most important aspect of a MPC-controller. It has to be created before the solver can be realized. If it&#x27;s unclear what the behavior of a system is, it&#x27;s not possible to search for meaningful actions. The workflow for creating a forward model is called system identification. The idea is to formalize a system in a set of equations which will behave like the original system. The error between the real system and the forward model can be measured.

There are many techniques available to create a forward model: ordinary differential equations is the classical one which is used in physics engines like Box2D. A more recent technique is a neural network for creating the forward model.

<doc id="552477" wikidata="Q690026" url="?curid=552477" title="Guanacaste Province">
<text>Guanacaste () is a province of Costa Rica located in the northwestern region of the country, along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Alajuela Province to the east, and Puntarenas Province to the southeast. It is the most sparsely populated of all the provinces of Costa Rica. The province covers an area of and as of 2010, had a population of 354,154, with annual revenue of $2 billion.

Guanacaste&#x27;s capital is Liberia. Other important cities include Cañas and Nicoya.

==Etymology==

The province is named for the guanacaste tree, also known as the ear pod tree, which is the national tree of Costa Rica.

==History==

Before the Spanish arrived, this territory was inhabited by Chorotega Indians from the towns of Zapati, Nacaome, Paro, Cangel, Nicopasaya, Pocosí, Diriá, Papagayo, Namiapí and Orosí. The Corobicies lived on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Nicoya, the Huetares in Abangares and the Nicarao in Bagaces.

The first church was built out of grass in Nicoya in the 17th century.

In the 18th century some neighbors from Rivas, Nicaragua, established their houses and cattle farms in the northern part of the Nicoya Peninsula at crossroads that connected the towns of Bagaces, Nicoya and Rivas. The place was baptized after the guanacaste trees that grow in the neighborhood.

After a plebiscite in 1824-25, the territory of Guanacaste was annexed to Costa Rica. In 1836 it was invaded by Nicaraguan forces and Costa Rican exiles but they were repelled. Later, the town of Guanacaste was declared the capital of the Guanacaste province. In 1854 the town of Guanacaste was renamed Liberia.

In 2013, Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega claimed Guanacaste province belonged to Nicaragua. Taking over Guanacaste would greatly increase the continental shelf area available to Nicaragua for oil exploration concessions, and move the Nicaraguan border to within of Costa Rican capital San José.

==Geography==
The province is bounded on the east by a group of green-swathed volcanoes forming the Cordillera de Guanacaste (which features Orosi, Rincón de la Vieja, Miravalles and Tenorio volcanoes) and the Cordillera de Tilarán. The rivers that tumble out of these steep mountains flow down to rolling flatlands, forming a vast alluvial plain drained by the Rio Tempisque, which empties through swampy wetlands into the Golfo de Nicoya. The Rio Tempisque defines one side of the horsehead-shaped Península de Nicoya enclosing the gulf to the west.

===Climate===
Guanacaste&#x27;s climate and culture are unique among Costa Rican provinces. The province experiences little rain and consistent heat from November to April, resulting in ubiquitous tropical dry forests as a natural adaption to the dry season conditions. Tourists seek out this dry heat during the North American winter to enjoy the Guanacastecan beaches. Irrigation of the agricultural land is necessary during the long dry period. From May to October, the climate is similar to that of San José, consisting of showers daily and moderate temperatures. Guanacaste is, however, considerably warmer than other provinces in the country located in higher elevations.

==Tourism==
Tourism spreads across Guanacaste&#x27;s and more than of coast line. The main tourist attractions include water, land, mountains, volcanoes, and coastal ecosystems. The two main commercial areas Santa Cruz and Liberia with six surrounding tourism development centers: Papagayo Peninsula, El Coco, Las Catalinas, Flamingo, Conchal, and Tamarindo. Liberia is central to the six locations and is complete with an airport. Animal rehab center, Centro de Rescate Las Pumas, is located in the heart of Area de Conservación Guanacaste World Heritage Site. The Guanacaste province is home to the bulk of Costa Rica&#x27;s all-inclusive resorts.

==Demographics==
Most of the population descends from Chorotega Natives and Spaniards, with some Africans as a result of a large number of slaves working the land during the colonial period. As in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Costa Rica &quot;Usted&quot; is the form of address used by Guanacastecans upon initial meetings and typically among adults. The &quot;vos&quot; verb-form is used mainly when adults address children, especially their own, and occasionally between adults who are family members or good friends.

The Chorotega culture and the Spanish culture have successfully integrated; among the main cultural elements are their music, literature (folklore), musical instruments, bullfighting, and religious events. 

==Economy==

The province has an economic and cultural heritage based on beef cattle ranching. Most of the area is covered by small patches of forest, scattered trees and large pastures of coarse grasses where Brahman cattle and related breeds graze.
Historically, the main source of income of Guanacaste was cattle ranching. Cattle ranching is declining in Guanacaste due to an international drop in the demand for beef. Many pastures are naturally reverting to dry forest or are being converted to tree plantations.

The other agricultural products of relative importance in the province are sugar cane and cotton, and since the late 1980s, with the creation of a large-scale irrigation program (the water comes from Lake Arenal after passing through several power generating stations), rice has become a prominent crop.

Since the late 20th century, tourism has emerged as the new and growing activity in the local economy. The combination of beaches like Playas del Coco, Playa Tamarindo, and the sunny dry season that coincides with the winter months in northern latitudes have made tourism a key economic activity. Many tourists are also attracted by the province&#x27;s seven national parks. These include the Santa Rosa, Guanacaste and Rincon de la Vieja National Parks.

==Political divisions==

Guanacaste is subdivided into eleven &quot;cantons&quot;. The cantons (with their capitals in parentheses) are:

# Liberia (Liberia)
# Nicoya (Nicoya)
# Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz)
# Bagaces (Bagaces)
# Carrillo (Filadelfia)
# Cañas (Cañas)
# Abangares (Las Juntas)
# Tilarán (Tilarán)
# Nandayure (Carmona)
# La Cruz (La Cruz)
# Hojancha (Hojancha)
A major portion of the peninsula of Nicoya is now under the jurisdiction of the province of Puntarenas. This may change in the future, as there is constant debate over the remapping of the area.

<text>Jakob Hermann (16 July 1678 – 11 July 1733) was a mathematician who worked on problems in classical mechanics. He is the author of &quot;Phoronomia&quot;, an early treatise on mechanics in Latin, which has been translated by Ian Bruce in 2015-16. In 1729, he proclaimed that it was as easy to graph a locus on the polar coordinate system as it was to graph it on the Cartesian coordinate system.

He appears to have been the first to show that the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is a constant of motion for particles acted upon by an inverse-square central force.

Hermann was born and died in Basel. He received his mathematical training from Jacob Bernoulli at the University of Basel and graduated with a degree in 1695. In 1696, he obtained a Master&#x27;s Degree by defending a dissertation on infinite series. Jacob Bernoulli considered Hermann to be the best of his many students at the university and when Jacob Bernoulli died in 1705, Gottfried Leibniz asked Hermann to write an obituary for Bernoulli in Acta Eruditorum. He became a member of the Berlin Academy in 1701. He was appointed to a chair in mathematics in Padua in 1707, but moved to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1713, and thence to St. Petersburg in 1724. In St.Petersburg, he worked closely together with Daniel Bernoulli who succeeded him in his post as he returned to Basel in 1731 to take a chair in ethics and natural law.

Hermann was elected to the &quot;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot; (Paris) in 1733, the year of his death.

Hermann was a second cousin of Leonhard Euler&#x27;s mother.

<text>Woodford is a London Underground station in the town of Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, East London. It is on the Central line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4. The station also acts as a terminus for the line via the Hainault loop and the next station via this loop is Roding Valley.

==History==
The station was originally opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch from Leyton to Loughton. Further alterations were carried out by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, including services to Ilford via the Fairlop Loop opened between Woodford and Newbury Park in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway until transfer to the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central line services of the London Underground. The station acted as a terminus of the Central line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle onwards towards Epping, where the LNER still had local freight services running between Epping and Loughton, and continued to Stratford (Liverpool Street on Sundays) until 5 October 1970. The extension was delayed by World War II and electric services commenced as far as Loughton (and around the &#x27;loop&#x27; to Hainault) on 21 November 1948.

As part of the electrification carried out for the transfer to the LPTB the original level crossing at the station, where Snakes Lane crossed the line, was closed and a bridge, to the south, was constructed. The original goods yard, which was closed in the late 1960s, now forms the car park.

During the planning of the Victoria line, route options included a continuation of the line from Walthamstow Central to Woodford or South Woodford stations. However, in 1961, the decision was taken to build only as far as Walthamstow Central.

==The station today==

The main western entrance is located off The Broadway with access to the station car park. The eastern entrance is located on Snakes Lane East. This entrance is closed after 21:00 and intercom is used to ask staff to unlock the gates at other times if necessary. The ticket office on that entrance is also no longer in use. There are three platform tracks, serving a side platform to the west of the line and an island platform to the east, with the track on the eastern side of the island platform being a south facing terminal track. Beyond this terminal track are five stabling sidings, also accessed from the south.

The station had gone through refurbishment works. The stanchions have been repainted in two-tone green with tactile strips work completed. Extensive PA and Help Points have been added with new public address system. An &#x27;owl&#x27; has also appeared suspended from the girder.

==Services and connections==
Woodford station is on the Central line between South Woodford to the west and Buckhurst Hill to the east. It is also a terminus of the line via the Hainault loop and the next station via this loop is Roding Valley. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 6–11 minutes between 05:22 and 00:49 eastbound to Epping, every 11–25 minutes between 06:48 and 23:37 to Hainault (and beyond) and every 5–10 minutes between 05:24 and 23:36 westbound.

London Bus routes 275, 549 and W14 serve the station.
