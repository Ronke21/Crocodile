<text>Stephen Richard Hackett (born 12 February 1950) is an English guitarist who gained prominence as the lead guitarist of the progressive rock band Genesis from 1971 to 1977. Hackett contributed to six Genesis studio albums, three live albums, seven singles and one EP before he left to pursue a solo career. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010.

Hackett released his first solo album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;, while still a member of Genesis in 1975. After a series of further solo albums beginning in 1978, Hackett co-founded the supergroup GTR with Steve Howe in 1986. The group released the self-titled album &quot;GTR&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and spawned the Top 20 single &quot;When the Heart Rules the Mind&quot;. When Hackett left GTR in 1987, the group disbanded. Hackett then resumed his solo career. He has released albums and toured worldwide on a regular basis since.

Hackett&#x27;s body of work encompasses many styles; in addition to his work in progressive rock, he has explored pop, blues, world music and classical music on his solo recordings. According to &quot;Guitar World&quot;: &quot;Hackett&#x27;s early explorations of two-handed tapping and sweep picking were far ahead of their time, and influenced Eddie Van Halen and Brian May.&quot; Other guitarists influenced by Hackett include Alex Lifeson and Steve Rothery.

== Early life ==
Stephen Richard Hackett was born on 12 February 1950 in Pimlico, central London to Peter and June Hackett. He was born one day before his future Genesis bandmate, singer Peter Gabriel. He has a younger brother John who took up the flute and has performed, collaborated and written with Hackett throughout his solo career, and helped compose some of the early Genesis songs uncredited including &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot; and &quot;Cuckoo Cocoon&quot;. Hackett attended Sloane Grammar School in Chelsea. In the 1950s, the family relocated to Vancouver, Canada but returned home after his parents, his mother in particular, became too homesick.

Hackett grew up having access to various musical instruments, such as the harmonica and recorder, but he did not develop an interest in the guitar until the age of 12 when he started playing single notes. By 14, he was learning chords and experimenting with chord progressions, although he never received any formal training.

Hackett&#x27;s earliest musical influences were classical (Johann Sebastian Bach) and opera (Mario Lanza). He has said that his compositions are still influenced by them. Hackett also has cited numerous British blues artists as influences, namely Danny Kirwan, Peter Green and various guitarists in John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, as well as Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles and King Crimson.

== Career ==

=== 1968–1970: Early bands ===
Hackett&#x27;s first professional playing experience came as a member of three rock bands: Canterbury Glass, with whom he played on &quot;Prologue&quot; on their album &quot;Sacred Scenes and Characters&quot; which was recorded in 1968 but distributed in 2007; Heel Pier; and Sarabande, all of whom performed rock with progressive rock elements. He then joined Quiet World in 1970 which featured his brother John on flute. He did not write any material with the group as the band&#x27;s founders directed what the other members played, which did not bother Hackett as he wished to get more experience in a recording studio since the band had secured a contract with a label. Hackett played on the band&#x27;s only studio album, &quot;The Road&quot; (1970), released on Dawn Records, and left them soon after.

=== 1970–1977: Genesis ===
In December 1970, Hackett placed an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in his search for a new band. It read: &quot;Imaginative guitarist-writer seeks involvement with receptive musicians, determined to strive beyond existing stagnant music forms&quot;. In a 2021 interview, Hackett explained that, by &#x27;stagnant&#x27;, he meant a lack of inclusion among the different music genres in the 1970s. The ad was responded to by Genesis lead vocalist Peter Gabriel. Genesis, which also comprised keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer Phil Collins, had lost founding guitarist Anthony Phillips and sought a new, permanent replacement to his temporary replacement Mick Barnard. Gabriel advised Hackett to listen to their last album &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970) before Hackett auditioned for the group. The audition was conducted by just Banks and Gabriel, since Rutherford was sick in bed. Rutherford later confessed that the reason Genesis had been having such a hard time finding a guitarist was that he was looking for someone with the same style and personality as Phillips, and that had he not been sick that day, Hackett would probably not have passed the audition.
Hackett&#x27;s first live performance with Genesis took place at City University, London on 14 January 1971. Hackett&#x27;s first recording with Genesis was &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; (1971). His guitar work is prominently featured through solos on &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot;, and despite the fact that much of the material had been written by the time he joined Genesis, he made considerable contributions to the songwriting. He wrote the solo on &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot; rather than improvising. Other significant songwriting contributions to &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; included half the lyrics and all of the music to &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;, and the pre-chorus of &quot;Seven Stones&quot;. He became an early proponent of the guitar tapping technique normally attributed to Eddie Van Halen. Hackett claimed that Van Halen learned the technique after attending a Genesis concert in the mid-1970s.

&quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972) includes Hackett&#x27;s guitar solo composition &quot;Horizons&quot;, which he based on a Suite for Cello by Bach. On the first day of recording &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, Hackett offered to leave Genesis because he felt he was not contributing enough to their work and would soon be kicked out of the band anyway, but Rutherford and Banks said they liked his playing and wanted him to stay. Hackett called this a pivotal moment which largely dispelled the insecurity he felt during his early days with the band. &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973) features Hackett using tapping and sweep picking, later popularised by Yngwie Malmsteen, both of which are used on &quot;Dancing with the Moonlit Knight&quot;. The song &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; contains one of Hackett&#x27;s most well-known guitar solos and remained a favourite in concert even after Hackett&#x27;s departure. The solo was in fact composed by Banks, but Gabriel, Collins, and Banks himself have all said that Hackett effectively made it his own with his interpretation. Gabriel said that &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; &quot;was [Hackett&#x27;s] coming-of-age album in a lot of ways.&quot;

The writing sessions for &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974) was a difficult time for the entire group, partly due to the personal lives of some members which affected the mood. Hackett explained: &quot;Everybody had their own agenda. Some of us were married, some of us had children, some of us were getting divorced. And we were still trying to get it together in the country&quot;. By &quot;some of us were getting divorced&quot;, Hackett was coyly referring to his divorce from his first wife; none of the other members were going through divorces. According to Banks, Hackett was not very involved in the songwriting for &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, though he did write the vocal melody for &quot;Cuckoo Cocoon&quot; and the lead melody for &quot;Hairless Heart&quot;, and co-wrote the music to &quot;It&quot; with Banks. Hackett picked out &quot;The Lamia&quot; and &quot;Fly on a Windshield&quot; as his favourite moments on the album.

Hackett has the distinction of being the only member of Genesis during his tenure who did not sing. Hackett explained, &quot;I was too shy to sing in those days; I thought I would sing out of tune.&quot;

After recording his debut album &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;, Hackett resumed working in Genesis, who recorded &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; (1976), the band&#x27;s first after Gabriel left the band. At this point Banks felt that the practice of crediting all Genesis songs as written by all the members no longer accurately reflected the balance within the group, since the bulk of &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; was written by Gabriel and himself, and at his prodding the band switched to using individual writing credits. As a result, Hackett is credited for co-writing only three of the eight songs on &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;: &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot;, &quot;Entangled&quot; and &quot;Los Endos&quot;. The follow-up, &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976), is Hackett&#x27;s final studio album with the band. He had grown increasingly constricted by his lack of freedom and level of input and was insistent that more of his material be included on the album, but was rebuffed. One of his rejected songs, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch&quot;, was adopted for his second solo album, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch!&quot;.

Hackett left the band during the mixing stage of the Genesis live album, &quot;Seconds Out&quot;. His departure was announced in the press during the promotion of the album on 8 October 1977. Hackett has said that he &quot;needed autonomy&quot;.

==== Reunions ====
Since Hackett&#x27;s departure, the 1970–1975 line-up of Genesis has reunited a handful of times. On 2 October 1982, the group gathered for Six of the Best, a one-off performance held to raise money for Gabriel&#x27;s WOMAD festival. In 1983, Hackett was joined on stage by Gabriel and Rutherford during a series of shows at the Civic Hall in Guildford, the three performing with Hackett&#x27;s band. The set list included a mix of Genesis songs, covers and tracks from their solo careers.

In 1998, members of Genesis reunited for a photo session and dinner to celebrate the release of the &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot; box set. The release featured Hackett and Gabriel re-recording some guitar and vocal parts, respectively. Hackett also participated in the re-recording of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; from &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; for inclusion on the 1999 greatest hits album &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot;.

In late 2005, the 1970–1975 line-up gathered to discuss the possibility of a reunion and performing &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. After Gabriel decided against the idea, Hackett opted out of the project. This led to Banks, Rutherford and Collins getting together in 2006 for the Turn It On Again: The Tour. Hackett took part in a series of interviews for the remastering of the band&#x27;s albums in 2007, and the interview book &quot;Genesis: Chapter and Verse&quot; released in the same year.

In March 2010, 1970–1975 line-up of Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio. Hackett appeared at the ceremony with Banks, Rutherford and Collins, though none of them performed.

In 2014, Hackett was featured in the BBC documentary &quot;&quot; which focused on the band and the solo careers of the other members. Hackett expressed his displeasure with it following its broadcast, which he described as a &quot;biased account of Genesis history&quot; which &quot;totally ignores&quot; his solo work. Hackett was included in the compilation album &quot;R-Kive&quot; containing Genesis material and tracks from each member&#x27;s solo career. His contributions are &quot;Ace of Wands&quot;, &quot;Every Day&quot; and &quot;Nomads&quot;.

In 2022, Hackett said he was invited to the final Genesis concert in London on 26 March. However, he was unable to attend due to his tour being rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== 1975–present: Solo career ===
==== 1970s ====

In October 1975, Hackett released his first solo album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;. Its original title was &quot;Premonitions&quot;, but management at Charisma disliked it and suggested &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;, to which Hackett agreed. The album features Collins and Rutherford on drums and bass, respectively, and reached No. 26 in the UK and was certified silver. Hackett enjoyed the freedom he had when writing and recording his own album, but was informed by Rutherford and Banks that he could not continue his solo career while in Genesis. Part of one of the album tracks, &quot;Shadow of the Hierophant&quot;, was rehearsed by Genesis during the writing and recording of &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. Upon its release Hackett resumed working in Genesis.

Hackett&#x27;s first post-Genesis album was &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch!&quot;, released in 1978. As with &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot; (1975), much of the material on the album was in the style of progressive rock. It did contain, however, much more vocal work. Hackett, who had never sung lead or backing vocals on a Genesis song, turned over most of the vocals to a number of singers, including folk singer Richie Havens, R&amp;B singer Randy Crawford, and Steve Walsh of American progressive rock group Kansas. He did provide lead vocals for &quot;Carry On Up the Vicarage&quot;, but they were processed using a &quot;laughing gnome&quot; vocal effect. The album peaked at no. 38 on the UK chart, and no. 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop Albums chart in the United States.

Having released two albums, Hackett was faced with the task of assembling a band to perform the material live. This became a group with John Hackett on flute, bass pedals and guitar, Dik Cadbury on bass and vocals, Nick Magnus on keyboards, John Shearer on drums, and Pete Hicks on lead vocals. The subsequent European tour was Hackett&#x27;s first as a solo performer. It began at the Chateau Neuf in Oslo, Norway on 4 October 1978 and ended with six shows across the UK, culminating at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 30 October. Hackett used his band on his next album, &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot;, recorded in the first two months of 1979 in the Netherlands. The album contains various musical styles, including straightforward and progressive rock, folk, and a wider range of instruments such as a Cantonese koto. It reached No. 22 in the UK and No. 138 in the US. The supporting tour included a spot at the Reading Festival in August 1979. Hackett looked back on this period, and the atmosphere within the group, as a hard working and positive one.

==== 1980s ====
Before Hackett recorded his fourth album &quot;Defector&quot;, he organised a series of gigs in November 1979, including one in London at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to test out new material. Hackett found the experience of recording &quot;Defector&quot; as equal to &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot; and noted the similarity in music between the two albums, though he considered the material on the latter as some of the strongest of his career. Upon its release &quot;Defector&quot; peaked the UK chart at No. 9, which remains his highest-charting album in the country. In the US, the album went to No. 144. The album&#x27;s tour saw Hackett perform his first solo dates in the US. The tour left Hackett exhausted, and recuperated in Brazil where he spent three months working on new songs.

Hackett changed musical directions with his fifth album, &quot;Cured&quot; (1981). It was recorded without his band which he had worked with since 1979, barring contributions from Magnus and John Hackett, and features Hackett handling all the lead vocals. Instead of using a drummer, Magnus used an electronic Linn drum machine. Although it contained tracks in a progressive rock and classical style for which Hackett was known, it also showcased a more pop-oriented approach. Released in August 1981, &quot;Cured&quot; peaked at No. 15 in the UK and No. 169 in the US. The album&#x27;s tour marked a line-up change with John Hackett and Magnus joined by Chas Cronk on bass and Ian Mosley on drums. The tour for &quot;Cured&quot; saw the band perform at the 1981 Reading Festival.

After promoting &quot;Cured&quot;, Hackett received an invitation to form a new trio with Keith Emerson and Jack Bruce, shortly followed by an offer to replace Paul Jones and become lead in a new West End musical production. He declined both offers, and went ahead with his next studio album, &quot;Highly Strung&quot;, put out in April 1983. It would be his last release on Charisma, as growing differences over Hackett&#x27;s direction, plus management resisting to release an acoustic or live album, caused an end to their partnership. &quot;Highly Strung&quot; went to No. 16 in the UK, and &quot;Cell 151&quot; became a minor hit there.

In 1983, Hackett had secured a deal with Lamborghini Records which supported the release of his seventh album, &quot;Bay of Kings&quot;, containing classical guitar compositions. The album went to No. 70 in the UK. This was followed, in August 1984, with Hackett returning to rock music in his next release, &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot;. It demonstrated a merge of his guitar with influences of Brazilian percussion and world music. The album peaked at No. 54 in the UK.

In 1985, Hackett formed the supergroup GTR with veteran Yes and Asia guitarist Steve Howe. The group released a gold-selling album, produced by Yes/Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes. The album included &quot;When the Heart Rules the Mind&quot;, which hit number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest charting US single in Hackett&#x27;s career. Hackett soon left GTR over financial and management squabbles. Hackett&#x27;s main reason for ending GTR was the lack of funds to continue the project, and his growing desire to pursue a less mainstream career path. Among them included charity and film work, including a jingle for an airline.

In 1986, Hackett also participated with former Yardbirds members Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith and Jim McCarty on their Box of Frogs project second album &quot;Strange Land&quot; together with Jimmy Page, Ian Dury and Graham Parker on tracks, &quot;I Keep Calling&quot;, &quot;20/20 Vision&quot; and &quot;Average&quot;. In 1987, Hackett contributed to the Genesis orchestral album &quot;We Know What We Like: The Music of Genesis&quot;, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra with arranger and conductor David Palmer.

After GTR, Hackett returned to the studio and recorded a new solo album, &quot;Momentum&quot;. The troubles he had faced in GTR led Hackett to rate the album as &quot;a theraputic, cathartic thing&quot; as he welcomed the return to recording &quot;music without props&quot;. Released in March 1988, his tour across Europe to promote the album was met with large and enthusiastic crowds which included gigs in Estonia, Russia, and the Soviet Union.

In late 1989, Hackett was the helm of the charity single &quot;Sailing&quot;, a cover of Rod Stewart&#x27;s 1975 hit released under the name Rock Against Repatriation. It was to raise money and awareness of Asian groups that left the difficult conditions of their home but were refused entry into Western countries. Released as a single in 1990, the song included Brian May, the Moody Blues, Mike Rutherford, Phil Manzanera, and Godley &amp; Creme.

In the 1980s he also made a special appearance on Brazilian singer Ritchie&#x27;s first album, named &quot;Voo de Coração&quot; (1983). He is co-author of the song &quot;A Mulher Invisível&quot; (1984), from the 2nd LP of the countryman living in Brazil and also played guitar on the track &quot;Meantime&quot; (a poem by Fernando Pessoa music by Ritchie) on the 4th LP of the artist, &quot;Loucura e Mágica&quot; (1987).

==== 1990s ====

In 1992, Hackett resumed touring for the first time in six years, which also saw his return to activity in the US in several years. His reason for the prolonged absence was down to his involvement in various legal issues which prevented him from touring there. Hackett was pleased that his 1992 North American tour was well attended, and used it to test the strength of some new material that he had been working on to an audience, as well as to promote his first live album, &quot;Time Lapse&quot;. A few months after the release of &quot;Time Lapse&quot;, Hackett also released a compilation album &quot;The Unauthorised Biography&quot;, which included two brand new studio tracks, one of which, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Away from Me&quot;, was a co-write between Hackett and Brian May of Queen. 1992 also saw Hackett&#x27;s acoustic performance with the London Chamber Orchestra with a program of Vivaldi. He picked the show as a career highlight.

In May 1993, Hackett released his tenth studio album, &quot;Guitar Noir&quot;. It includes the track &quot;Walking Away from Rainbows&quot;, which lyrically dealt with Hackett&#x27;s career decision of leaving mainstream music and pursuing what he wishes. Shortly after its release Hackett considered the album &quot;the most crucial thing I&#x27;ve ever done. It&#x27;s been the thing I&#x27;ve most wanted to do as an album because I&#x27;ve been reduced to silence for so long.&quot; Hackett followed this with a blues album, &quot;Blues with a Feeling&quot; (1994), which included 3 covers in its 12 tracks.

For his next album, Hackett decided to rework a selection of Genesis tracks with various guest musicians. This was released in 1996 as &quot;Genesis Revisited&quot;, which peaked at No. 95 in the UK. It includes &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, a track Hackett wrote with Peter Gabriel in 1973 during the &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; sessions that had remained unfinished. Hackett promoted the album with two shows in Tokyo in December 1996 with John Wetton, Chester Thompson, Ian McDonald, and Julian Colbeck. The concerts were recorded and filmed, later released as &quot;The Tokyo Tapes&quot; in 1998.

In April 1997 he released the neo-classical influenced &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; with accompaniments from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. It reached the top 10 UK classical chart. This marked the beginning of keyboardist, arranger, and producer Roger King taking a more prominent role on Hackett&#x27;s future albums and live shows. In 1999, Hackett released his fourteenth studio album, &quot;Darktown&quot;. The album is named after a book, and the music and lyrical ideas took eight years to finalise. Hackett looked back on the album as one with lyrical themes that he had not been &quot;brave enough&quot; to present before. It went to No. 156 in the UK.

==== 2000s ====

In 2000, Hackett and his brother John released &quot;Sketches of Satie&quot;, a tribute album to the French composer Erik Satie with the compositions rearranged for flute and guitar. Hackett said that he had not worked on a project with John for some time and had missed playing with him, leading to his manager Billy Budis to suggest an album of Satie&#x27;s music. Later in 2000, an album of Hackett&#x27;s with material originally put together in 1986 but put on the shelf, was released as &quot;Feedback 86&quot;. A portion of the material was for a second GTR album, and features appearances by Brian May.

In 2001, Hackett contributed instrumental music to the score of &quot;Outwitting Hitler&quot;, a documentary about a Holocaust survivor. It was his first venture into soundtrack work, and had one weekend to finish it. He used themes that he had previously released with some originally intended for his future guitar/orchestra album &quot;Metamorpheus&quot; (2005).

In 2003, Hackett released &quot;To Watch the Storms&quot;, his first studio album in four years and his first completed in his new recording studio, Crown Studios. It also marked his return to progressive rock music, and unlike his several previous records the material was put together within three months. His next solo release was the orchestral &quot;Metamorpheus&quot; (2005) with the Underworld Orchestra, which dates back to 1997 when Hackett recorded his guitar parts for the songs. This was followed by the rock album &quot;Wild Orchids&quot; (2006), followed by &quot;Tribute&quot; (2007), a classical album showcasing original pieces and renditions of those by Bach, Byrd, Barrios, and Andrés Segovia.

The recording of &quot;Out of the Tunnel&#x27;s Mouth&quot; (2009), was met with various legal issues, including those instigated by his ex-wife Kim Poor and his former manager Billy Budis regarding its rights and attempt to block its release, to prevent Hackett from playing on records by other artists, and the ownership of Hackett&#x27;s catalogue on Camino Records. A court decision allowed Hackett to &quot;be back in the record business&quot;, and to release &quot;Out of the Tunnel&#x27;s Mouth&quot; on his new label Wolfwork Records in October 2009. The album was recorded at Hackett&#x27;s own flat rather than a professional studio. It features contributions by former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips and Yes bassist Chris Squire. Hackett toured the album.

In August 2009, an official, authorised biography, &quot;Sketches of Hackett&quot; by Alan Hewitt, was released. The first edition hardback includes a bonus DVD with a 90-minute interview.

==== 2010s ====
On 15 March 2010, Genesis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Hackett making a rare appearance alongside Collins, Banks and Rutherford at the ceremony, though they did not perform together. Hackett had put on record his willingness to participate in a reunion. A planned reunion of the classic 1970s Genesis line-up fell apart in 2007 when Peter Gabriel expressed reservations, and subsequently Hackett dropped out in deference to the Genesis &#x27;trio&#x27; line-up, as opposed to the four-piece.

In 2011, Hackett released his 24th studio album &quot;Beyond the Shrouded Horizon&quot; (no. 133 in the UK album chart). In 2012 he went on tour to promote the album in the UK. In 2012, Hackett and Chris Squire again collaborated to release the album &quot;A Life Within a Day&quot; under the name of Squackett.
Hackett released &quot;Genesis Revisited II&quot; in October 2012. His main reason to revisit the project was the desire to perform the material live once more, and got various musicians to perform the songs which cover material by Genesis and some solo material. Involved was former Genesis lead vocalist Ray Wilson. The album was met with enthusiasm from the public which resulted in Hackett making a stronger chart presence and a sell out supporting tour in the UK. The album reached No. 24 in the UK. In June 2013, both &quot;Genesis Revisited&quot; albums were awarded a Japanese Gold Sales Award for 100,000 copies sold. The UK tour included a show at Hammersmith Apollo, London which won Hackett the Event of the Year Award at the 2013 Progressive Music Awards. The show was released on CD and DVD as &quot;Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith&quot; which reached No. 58 in the UK. Hackett completed a second tour with a rearranged setlist in 2014 which spawned &quot;Genesis Revisited: Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. This reached No. 80 in the UK. Following the success of the Genesis Revisited tours, Hackett has considered himself as &quot;the keeper of the flame of the early work&quot; of Genesis.

In March 2015, Hackett released &quot;Wolflight&quot;. It reached No. 31 in the UK. &quot;Wolflight&quot; also contains Chris Squire&#x27;s last studio recording with the track &quot;Love Song to a Vampire&quot;. In September 2015, the independent music company Wienerworld released &quot;The Man, The Music&quot;, a documentary on Hackett&#x27;s career that went to No. 5 on the UK DVD chart. That October, Universal/Virgin released &quot;Premonitions: The Charisma Years 1975–1983&quot;, a 14-disc box set of his first six studio albums with extra material including live recordings and new remixes by Steven Wilson.

Hackett&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Night Siren&quot; (no. 28 UK album chart) was released in March 2017 and entered top 40 in six international album charts. The album continues the exploration of world music/progressive rock, and also contains influences from the Beatles&#x27; psychedelia period and classic science fiction. In October Hackett won the &quot;Chris Squire Virtuoso&quot; award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards.

In October 2018, Hackett underwent a UK tour which featured his band performing Genesis and solo tracks with the 41-piece Heart of England Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Bradley Tkachuk. Tkachuk and his brother took the orchestral arrangements that they had produced for a concert that Hackett performed in Buffalo, New York in 2017, which also featured an orchestra on stage, as the basis for the orchestral parts used for the tour, including those from Hackett&#x27;s collaboration with the Icelandic band Todmobile. A live album and concert film from the tour was released in 2019, entitled at the Royal Festival Hall, London was released in 2019, entitled &quot;Genesis Revisited Band &amp; Orchestra: Live at the Royal Festival Hall&quot;.

Hackett released &quot;At the Edge of Light&quot;, in January 2019. The album reached no 28 in the UK and marked Hacketts 10th solo album on the UK top 40 album charts since his solo debut in 1975. In 2019, Hackett toured with a set comprising &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; performed in its entirety with other Genesis songs, plus tracks from &quot;At the Edge of Light&quot; and &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot; to commemorate the latter&#x27;s fortieth anniversary. The show at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo, the last of the tour was released as a live album and concert film on 25 September 2020, entitled &quot;Selling England by the Pound &amp; Spectral Mornings: Live at Hammersmith&quot;.

====2020s====
In March 2020, Hackett cancelled his existing North American tour just before a performance in Harrisburg, PA due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He resumed touring with performances including Genesis&#x27; &quot;Seconds Out&quot; in September 2021 in Leicester followed by resumption of the cancelled North American tour in April 2022 in Boston following cancellation of the Canadian leg of the tour in March due to a case of COVID in the touring team.

In July 2020, Hackett released an autobiography, &quot;A Genesis in My Bed&quot;. In an interview promoting the book, he revealed that he was collaborating with Roger King on an acoustic album with an orchestra named &quot;Under a Mediterranean Sky&quot;, as well as a rock album with world music influences named &quot;Surrender of Silence&quot;. The albums were released on 22 January 2021 and 10 September 2021, respectively. &quot;Surrender of Silence&quot; entered the UK chart at 31 and made the top 10 chart in Germany. 

Another solo album, &quot;The Circus and the Nightwhale&quot; was released 16 February 2024 on InsideOut Music.

On 16 April 2024, Hackett was hospitalised due to an adverse reaction to medication for a bronchial infection, with a show at Phoenix consequently cancelled.

Hackett has been married three times. His first was to Ellen Busse in 1972 and the couple had one son, Oliver (b. 1974). The marriage ended in a divorce in 1974. In 1981, Hackett married Brazilian painter and jewellery artist Kim Poor, who designed many of his album covers. They divorced in 2007, which led Poor to file a legal case against Hackett, claiming she was a joint owner of Stephen Hackett Ltd., into which all future royalties from Genesis songs he had written and performed were paid. In 2006, Hackett arranged for all royalties to be paid directly to him rather than the company, which Poor argued was in breach of the agreement whereby she was entitled to a share of the money. Poor also challenged Hackett&#x27;s right to make new albums independently, causing further issues. The case was settled in 2010.

In June 2011, Hackett married author Jo Lehmann, who has written lyrics on several of Hackett&#x27;s songs. Jo&#x27;s sister Amanda is a singer, songwriter, and musician who has performed on several of Hackett&#x27;s songs and tours since 2009.

<text>Alexander Balmain Bruce (31 January 18317 August 1899) was a Scottish churchman and theologian. He was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland.

==Life==
He was born at Aberdalgie in the parish of Abernethy, Perthshire, on 13 January 1831, was the son of David Bruce, a farmer. His elder brother was the Presbyterian minister David Bruce. He was educated at Auchterarder parish school.

At the Disruption of 1843 his father relocated with his family to Edinburgh.

Bruce entered Edinburgh University in 1845 and the divinity hall of the Free Church of Scotland in 1849.
His early faith was subjected to severe trials during his studies, and he was at times &#x27;precipitated down to the ground floor of the primaeval abyss.&#x27;
These doubts, however, he surmounted and entered the Free Church ministry.

After acting as assistant, first at Ancrum and then at Lochwinnoch, he was called to Cardross in Dumbartonshire in 1859.
In 1868, he was translated to the east Free Church at Broughty Ferry in Forfarshire, and in 1871 he published his studies on the gospels entitled &quot;The Training of the Twelve,&quot; which established his reputation as a biblical scholar and a writer of ability.
They were originally delivered from the Cardross pulpit, and reached a second edition in 1877. In 1874, Bruce was Cunningham lecturer, taking as his subject &quot;The Humiliation of Christ&quot; (Edinburgh, 1876, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1881); and in 1875, on the death of Patrick Fairbairn, he was appointed to the chair of apologetics and New Testament exegesis in the Free Church Hall at Glasgow.
In the twenty-four years during which he occupied this chair he exercised the strongest influence over students, both from his wide knowledge and on account of the magnetism of his mind.
At the same time he published a number of exegetical works which established his fame with a wider circle.
Among the more noteworthy were &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Conception of Christianity&quot; (1894), his &#x27;Commentary on the Synoptic Gospels&#x27; in the &quot;Expositor&#x27;s Greek Testament&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Epistle to the Hebrews: the First Apology for Christianity&quot; (1899).
He and William Robertson Smith were the first Scottish scholars whose authority was regarded with respect among German biblical critics.

The boldness of Bruce&#x27;s views was not, however, entirely pleasing to his colleagues in the Free Church.
In 1889, he published &quot;The Kingdom of God; or, Christ&#x27;s Teachings according to the Synoptic Gospels&quot; (Edinburgh, 8vo), a work which gave rise to considerable criticism owing to his treatment of the inspired writings.
In 1890, the tendency of his views and those of Dr. Marcus Dods was considered by the general assembly, but that body came to the conclusion that while some of their statements had been unguarded, their writings were not at variance with the standards of the church (, Reply to Letter of Professor Blaikie, 1890 ; Kere, Vivisection in Theology, 1890 ; Richardson, Dr. Bruce on the Kingdom of God, 1890 ; The Case Stated, 1890).

Bruce rendered great services to the music of his church. He acted as convener of the hymnal committees which issued the &#x27;Free Church Hymn Book&#x27; in 1882, and in 1898 the &#x27;Church Hymnary&#x27; for all the Scottish presbyterian churches. He was Gifford lecturer in Glasgow University for 1896–7, choosing as his subjects &#x27;The Providential Order of the World&#x27; (London, 1897, 8vo) and &#x27;The Moral Order of the World in Ancient and Modern Thought&#x27; (London, 1899, 8vo). From 1894 he assisted Canon T. K. Cheyne in editing the &#x27;Theological Translation Library.&#x27;

Bruce died on 7 August 1899 at 32 Hamilton Park Terrace, Glasgow, and was buried on 10 August at Broughty Ferry.

==Family==
In 1860 he married Jane Hunter Walker (1832–1900), daughter of James Walker of Fodderslee in Roxburghshire. She survived him with a son David, a Glasgow writer, partner in the firm of Mitchell &amp; Bruce, and a daughter, who married Milward Valentine of Manchester and New York.

Besides the works mentioned he was the author of:
* &#x27;The Chief End of Revelation,&#x27; London, 1881, 8vo.
* &#x27;The Parabolic Teaching of Christ,&#x27; London, 1882, 8vo; new edit. 1889.

<text>Creatures 3 is the third game in the &quot;Creatures&quot; a-life game series made by Creature Labs. In this installment, the Shee have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order.

There are 6 main &quot;metarooms&quot; on the ship; the Norn Terrarium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The Norn Terrarium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the Grendel mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the Ettin mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world.

Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original &quot;Creatures&quot; Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert.

&quot;Creatures 3&quot; runs on the CAOS engine, making it highly moddable, but now it is retired and outdated.

In December 2021, Creatures 3 was released on the Steam games service.

<text>Creatures 2 is the second game in the &quot;Creatures&quot; artificial life game series made by Creature Labs, and the sequel to the 1996 game &quot;Creatures&quot;. It features three species: the cute, dependent Norns, the cantankerous Grendels and the industrious Ettins. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in. The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures&#x27; development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak.

Many new gameplay features included in &quot;Creatures 2&quot; not present in the original game include a new physics model and a global weather system, along with brand new applets and a world twice the size of the &quot;Creatures 1&quot; world.

The executable file for the game was in fact an interpreter for its scripting language, thus allowing users to make total conversions or derivative works from the game.

==Gameplay==
Like the other games in the series, &quot;Creatures 2&quot; is mostly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, allowing the player to raise Norns at their own pace. In each new world, the player begins in the incubator cavern area. The hatchery, one of the game&#x27;s in-built applets, allows the player to add Norn eggs to the world, which can be hatched via the incubator. Norns may also be downloaded from the internet and imported in to use in the game.

Once Norns reach adolescence at around an hour old, they are ready to breed, and female Norns will begin an oestrogen cycle. When Norns mate, there is a long kissing sound with a pop at the end – known as a kisspop. Like real life, not all mating results in a pregnancy. The Norn reproductive process can be monitored via the Breeder&#x27;s Kit.

At the beginning, the player is only able to navigate a small area of Albia. As their Norns explore the world, however, more areas will be able to be visited. If a Norn falls into water and is picked up, it cannot be placed in an unvisited area.

Like the previous game, every plant, animal and insect in Albia is a separate system called an autonomous agent, or just &quot;agent&quot; for short. Many user-created agents have been made, which can be injected into the world using the Injector Kit applet, which also includes an analysis page giving the opportunity to check new objects for potentially harmful contents before injecting them.

Albia, the world in which &quot;Creatures 2&quot; is set, is a vast disc-world filled with a wide variety of flora, ranging from the Cacti that inhabit the desert to the exclusive mushroom-like Gelsemium plant that can only be found in a single cavern. Albia is also home to a substantial amount of animal life, such as bees which pollinate flowers and create honey, and Zander fish, which provide a food source for creatures near the oceans. Scattered throughout the world are various seed launchers, which can be used to replenish stocks if any life-forms become extinct.

Albia also has four seasons: Spring, Summer, Winter and Autumn, and boasts its very own climate, with weather such as snow mainly occurring during the colder months, and rain mostly during the Spring. The game also has an on-screen thermometer, allowing the player to monitor Albia&#x27;s temperature at all times.

==Development==
&quot;Creatures 2&quot;″s release was widely anticipated. It is likely that around 450,000 copies of the original &quot;Creatures&quot; had been sold by the time the game was released, and a huge following had developed behind it. The &quot;Early Adoption Program&quot;, a promotion where 250 copies of &quot;Creatures 2&quot; were given away prior to its official release in September 1998, was scheduled to begin in July 1998, but was pushed back as the game was not close to release quality at the point at which the EAP was scheduled to start. In the end, most received their copies several weeks after the release date.

The creatures themselves had been provided with &quot;considerably more sensory input, more actions they can take, and improved brain dynamics&quot;. The game world included a &quot;complete working eco-system&quot;.

Upon release, the game suffered from numerous flaws, such as a deficient Norn genome that lead to a condition dubbed &quot;One-Hour Stupidity Syndrome (OHSS)&quot;, which caused Norns to forget basic survival skills such as eating and sleeping. The task of creating the new Norn genome was given to Sandra Linkletter (Slink), who was also a member of the &quot;Creatures&quot; community. During development, many problems emerged, most likely due to disagreements between Slink and the &quot;Creatures 2&quot; team. Slink later claimed that her design had been compromised by the geneticist brought on to finish her work, Eric Goodwin, and later accused Cyberlife of deriving their update from hers.

Cyberlife later released a patch with an improved genome after several weeks had passed. Several users also created improved Norn genomes, such as the Canny Norn genome created by Chris Double and Lis Morris.

Two expansion packs, Life Kit 1 and Life Kit 2, were released for C2.

==Reception==
200,000 copies of &quot;Creatures 2&quot; were immediately shipped upon its release. &quot;Creatures 2&quot; was considered &quot;much more difficult&quot; than &quot;C1&quot;, and the new, more challenging environment and Norn biology was described as frustrating, but that after installing a new genome and going through successive generations, the Norns seemed smarter. Nick Walkland described the gameplay as a &quot;labour of love&quot;, noting that the challenge was to sustain your Norns&#x27; lives. Sid Fisk of Gamezilla criticized the audio for &quot;Creatures 2&quot; for not alerting him when his creature was near-death, but playing a &quot;funeral dirge&quot; as the body left the screen.

<text>:&quot;Note in particular that this George Smith is to be distinguished from George Smith (Assyriologist) (1840–1876) who researched in some overlapping areas.&quot;
Sir George Adam Smith (19 October 1856 – 3 March 1942) was a Scottish theologian. He was the Principal of the University of Aberdeen between 1909 and 1935 and an important figure in the  United Free Church of Scotland.

==Life==
He was born in Calcutta, where his father, George Smith, C.I.E., was then Principal of the Doveton College, a boys&#x27; school in Madras. His mother was Janet Colquhoun Smith (née Adam). By 1870 the family had returned to Scotland and were living at Scagore House in Seafield, Edinburgh.

He was educated at Edinburgh in the Royal High School. He then studied Divinity at the University of Edinburgh and the New College, graduating MA in 1875.

After studying for summer semesters as a postgraduate at the University of Tübingen (1876) and the University of Leipzig (1878) and travelling in Egypt and Syria, he was ordained into the Free Church of Scotland in 1882 and served at the Queen&#x27;s Cross Free Church in Aberdeen.

In 1892 he was appointed Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament subjects in the Free Church College at Glasgow. In 1900 (at its creation) he moved from the Free Church of Scotland to the United Free Church of Scotland.

In 1909, he was appointed Principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, a post he held until his retirement in 1935. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1916, and was knighted in the same year.

He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the United Free Church of Scotland in 1916-17. 

In 1917, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Horne, Cargill Gilston Knott, Ben Peach and John Sutherland Black.

He was appointed a Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King George V in 1933, and reappointed by King Edward VIII and King George VI.

From 1924 to 1938 he was Patron of the Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen.

He died at home, &quot;Sweethillocks&quot; in Balerno south-west of Edinburgh on 3 March 1942. He is buried with his wife and children in the north-east corner of Currie Cemetery in south-west Edinburgh.

==Family==
In 1889 he married Alice Lillian Buchanan (1866-1949), daughter of Sir George Buchanan MD FRS. They had seven children:

*George Buchanan Smith (1890-1915);
*Robert Dunlop Smith (1892-1917);
*Lilian May Buchanan Drew (1894-1980);
*Alick Buchanan-Smith, Baron Balerno (1898-1984);

<doc id="557203" wikidata="Q2002789" url="?curid=557203" title="William of Norwich">
<text>William of Norwich (died 22 March 1144) was an apprentice who lived in the English city of Norwich. He suffered a violent death during Easter 1144. The city&#x27;s French-speaking Jewish community was blamed for his death, but the crime was never solved. William&#x27;s case is the first known example of a medieval blood libel.

The only detailed information about William is from Thomas of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk and a member of Norwich Cathedral&#x27;s Priory, which took possession of his relics. William was promoted as a Christian saint by the Priory. They commissioned Monmouth to write the hagiographical &quot;The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich&quot; in 1150 to state the case for William&#x27;s claim to sainthood. However, he was never formally canonised, and the Priory&#x27;s claims were largely ignored by the people of Norwich: &quot;There is not a single extant calendar from the vicinity, other than those from the priory itself, that includes a commemoration of William.&quot;

==Accounts==
===&quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;===
The &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;, a continuation of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, contains an account of the murder of William of Norwich:

===Thomas of Monmouth===
Since most information about William&#x27;s life comes from Thomas of Monmouth, it is difficult to distinguish the facts of the case from the story of martyrdom created around it by Monmouth. Thomas of Monmouth was a Benedictine monk that lived in the Priory at Norwich Cathedral, having arrived in Norwich in around 1150. Encouraged by the bishop, he appears to have interviewed surviving witnesses of the event and claimed to have obtained inside information about Norwich&#x27;s Jewish community. His account is set out in &quot;The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich&quot; ().

According to Thomas of Monmouth, William was born on 2 February 1132 to a local couple. He was apprenticed to a skinner and tanner, often coming into contact with members of the city&#x27;s Jewish population. His mother was approached by a man claiming to work for the Archdeacon of Norwich; he offered William a job in the Archdeacon&#x27;s kitchens. Agreeing, she was paid three shillings to let her son go. William and the man then visited William&#x27;s aunt, who told her daughter to follow William and the man. The last time William was seen alive by his family was on Holy Tuesday, when he and the man went into the house of a local Jew.

Thomas claims William was tortured before being murdered:

According to Thomas, the body was found on Holy Saturday in Thorpe Wood, north of the city. It was seen by a nun, before a forester, Henry de Sprowston, came across William in his jacket and shoes. Henry saw that the boy had been gagged before suffering a violent death. It was decided to bury the boy in unconsecrated ground on Easter Monday. People came to look at him, and William was recognised. The body was then buried at the murder site. The following day, members of William&#x27;s family, one of whom, Godwin Stuart, was a priest, confirmed him as the victim. He was then reburied following a Requiem Mass.

William&#x27;s family and their fellow English quickly blamed the local Jewish community for the crime and demanded justice from the ecclesiastical court of Bishop William de Turbeville. Members of the Jewish community were summoned by the Bishop to attend court and submit to trial by ordeal, but the local Norman sheriff, John de Chesney, advised them that the ecclesiastical court had no jurisdiction over them, as they were not Christians.

He then took the Jews into protection in Norwich Castle. After the situation had calmed down, they returned to their homes. The issue was revived two years later, when a member of the Jewish community was murdered in an unrelated incident. King Stephen agreed to look into the matter, but later decided not to pursue it.

Meanwhile, William&#x27;s body had been moved to the monastery cemetery. Bishop de Turbeville and other members of the local clergy attempted to create a &quot;cultus&quot; around him as a Christian martyr, but this plan did not succeed. There was no evidence in the initial accusations against local Jews that the murder was related to religious activity of any kind, but as the cult developed, so did a story of how and why William was killed.

Thomas of Monmouth&#x27;s account is attributed to the testimony of a monk and former Jew named Theobald of Cambridge. Theobald alleged that the murder was a human sacrifice and that the &quot;ancient writings of his fathers&quot; required the yearly killing of a Christian on Good Friday. This was allegedly for two reasons: to one day return to the Holy Land during the Messianic Age and to punish Jesus Christ for the religious persecution that the Jewish people continued to experience at the hands of his followers. While there is no such commandment for human sacrifice anywhere in Jewish theology or Rabbinic literature, Theobald further alleged that William&#x27;s murderers were heretics according to the standards of conventional Orthodox Judaism. The murder was allegedly ordered at Narbonne, by a cult leader who had, similarly to Sabbatai Zevi, declared himself to be the Jewish Messiah and who had cast lots to select where in Europe his followers were to commit the murder. The lots had allegedly fallen first upon England and then upon Norwich and the pseudo-messiah informed his followers among the French-speaking Jewish communities of England by both messengers and letters.

According to many Jewish primary sources from the period, self-appointed Messiahs and their followers were far from unusual in Europe or the Middle East during the 12th century. For example, Maimonides&#x27; 1173/4 Epistle to Yemen warns the Jewish community of Yemen against joining similarly heterodox and syncretistic cults led by pseudo-messiahs and mentions the recent violent deaths of just such a pseudo-messianic cult-leader and his followers in France. According to Jewish Medievalist Jacob R. Marcus, &quot;The Crusades, which began in the eleventh century, stimulated Messianic movements all over the world. Both in Christian and Moslem lands the Jews looked forward to the coming of the Messiah and the return to the Holy Land. Persecutions at the hands of Christian Crusaders and Moslem fanatics, the Christian conquest of Palestine, the political changes in the map of Asia Minor, the oppressive taxation – all these things induced in the Jews of almost every land the hope that the day of their redemption had also come. Self-proclaimed Messiahs arose to lead the expectant masses back to Jerusalem.&quot;

If Thomas of Monmouth&#x27;s claims about the case were accurate, however, both Jewish and Christian records and chronicles in Southern France would have made at least some mention of a violent messianic cult based at Narbonne.

Thomas of Monmouth supported his claims by saying that another converted former member of the Messianic cult told him that there was an argument over how to dispose of the body. Monmouth also says that a Christian servant woman glimpsed the child through a chink in a door. Another man is said to have confessed on his deathbed, years after the events, that he saw a group of Jews transporting a body on a horse in the woods.

Thomas of Monmouth also quoted Theobald as follows, &quot;I was, at that time at Cambridge, a Jew among Jews, and the commission of the crime was no secret to me. But in process of time, as I became acquainted with the glorious display of miracles which the divine power carried out through the merits of the blessed martyr William, I became much afraid, and following the dictates of my conscience, I forsook Judaism, and turned to the Christian faith.&quot;

==Context==

===The Jews in Norwich===
The Jewish community is thought to have been established in Norwich by 1135, only nine years before the murder, though one Jew called &#x27;Isaac&#x27; is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Most lived in a Jewish quarter or &quot;Jewry&quot;, located in what is now the Haymarket and White Lion Street. The Jews were a French-speaking community, like the Anglo-Normans, and were closely associated with them. The &quot;Jewry&quot; was very close to the Castle, a pattern seen in other English towns where Jews were under the protection of the Normans.

William and his family were of Anglo-Saxon descent and several of his relatives were married priests following local tradition. Conflicts between local Anglo-Saxons and Normans may well have lent themselves to conspiracy theories regarding capital crimes by French-speaking Jews being covered up by French-speaking Normans. Tensions were particularly high during the reign of King Stephen when the murder occurred. Thomas of Monmouth alleges that the sheriff was bribed by the Norwich Jewish community to protect them.

There may also have been background conflicts between the cathedral, the sheriff and local people about rights in the city and suburbs. Monmouth repeatedly invokes God as the sole source of justice for Anglo-Saxons against corrupt Norman sheriffs. He also claims that John de Chesney, the sheriff who protected the city&#x27;s Jews, was later punished with internal bleeding.

===Cult===
The wish of the local clergy, in particular, of Bishop William de Turbeville, to establish a &quot;cultus&quot; may at least in part have been financially motivated. The Bishop encouraged Thomas of Monmouth to question local people and to write his book.

After being buried in the monk&#x27;s cemetery, the body of William was moved to progressively more prestigious places in the church, being placed in the chapter house in 1150 and close to the High Altar in 1151. Monmouth devotes most of his book not to the murder, but to the evidence for William&#x27;s sanctity, including mysterious lights seen around the body itself and miraculous cures effected on local devotees. Monmouth admits that some of the clergy, notably the Prior, Elias, were opposed to the cult on the grounds that there was little evidence of William&#x27;s piety or martyrdom. Monmouth promoted the claims by providing evidence of visions of William and miracles.

Historian Paul Dalton states that the cult of William was predominantly &quot;protective and pacificatory&quot; in character, having similarities to that of another child saint, Faith of Conques. Despite its origins, the cult itself was not associated with the promotion of anti-Jewish activity. The cult was a minor one even at its height. There is little evidence of a flourishing cult of William in Norwich – surviving financial records listing offerings made at his shrine at Norwich Cathedral suggest that, although its fortunes waxed and waned, for much of its history there were few pilgrims, although offerings continued to be made until at least 1521. A temporary boost to the shrine&#x27;s popularity occurred after 1376, when William was adopted by the Norwich Peltier&#x27;s Guild, whose annual service at the Cathedral included a child who played the part of William. There was also a scholars&#x27; guild dedicated to St William in the Norfolk town of Bishop&#x27;s Lynn.
Images of William as a martyr were created for some churches, mostly in the vicinity of Norwich. A panel of painted oak, depicting William and Agatha of Sicily, is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; William is shown holding a hammer and with three nails in his head. The panel was formerly part of a rood screen at the Norwich Church of St John Maddermarket. The screen was commissioned by Ralph Segrym (died 1472), a merchant who became a Member of Parliament and Mayor of Norwich.

William is depicted on the rood screens of a number of other Norfolk churches: St Mary&#x27;s Church, Worstead and St John&#x27;s Church, Garboldisham depict William holding nails; the screen in Holy Trinity Church, Loddon depicts William being crucified.

===Aftermath===
As a result of the feelings generated by the William ritual murder story and subsequent intervention by the authorities on behalf of the accused, the growing suspicion of collusion between corrupt sheriffs and nobles and Jews fuelled the general anti-Jewish and anti-Norman mood of the population. After Thomas of Monmouth&#x27;s version of William&#x27;s death circulated a number of other unsolved child murders were attributed to Jewish conspiracies, including Harold of Gloucester (d. 1168) and Robert of Bury (d. 1181). The best-known of these was Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255). This became known as the blood libel.

By the reign of Richard the Lionheart attitudes towards English Jews had become less tolerant. This, in conjunction with the increase in national opinion in favour of a Crusade, and the conflation of all non-Christians in the Medieval Christian imagination, led to the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of Richard in 1189 being attacked by the crowd. A widespread attack began on the Jewish population, leading to massacres of Jews at London and York.

The attacks were followed by others throughout England. When the Norman nobility of Norwich attempted to suppress these activities, the yeomanry and peasants revolted against the lords and attacked their supporters, especially Norwich&#x27;s Jewish community. On 6 February 1190, the Jews who were found in their own houses at Norwich were killed; others had taken refuge in the castle.

During the development of Chapelfield, Norwich, in 2004 a well with the remains of the remains of at least 6 adults and 11 children was discovered. Analysis showed strong affinities to living Ashkenazi Jewish groups.

Hostility against Jews continued until, in 1290, Jews were expelled from England by King Edward I. Jews were not officially allowed to resettle in England until after 1655, when Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell commissioned the Whitehall Conference to debate the proposals made by Menasseh ben Israel. While the Conference reached no verdict, it is seen as the beginning of resettlement of the Jews in England.

==Other theories of the crime==
===19th century===

The story of William&#x27;s supposed martyrdom in a Jewish conspiracy persisted for many centuries. In 1853, an author attributed William&#x27;s death to a conspiracy of &quot;the Jews, then the leading doctors, merchants and scholars of the day&quot;, and that they escaped then punishment.

The first analysis of the murder was written by M. R. James in 1896. Noting Thomas of Monmouth&#x27;s use of testimonies to construct a consistent account, James argued that these were inventions or were unreliable, or were manipulated to fit the story. James maintained that the murder&#x27;s ritual nature emerged only after a man named Theobald, keen to ingratiate himself with the Christian community, promoted the idea. James suggested other causes for William&#x27;s death, including the possibility of it being an accident, or that William was killed and his murderer (or accidental killer) escaped detection by causing blame for the crime to be placed upon the Jews.

The literary critic Joseph Jacobs speculated in 1897 that William&#x27;s family had held a mock crucifixion over Easter, during which William fell into a cataleptic trance and died as a result of burial. Jacobs pointed out that Jews would have had to carry the body through Norwich to get to the wood.

===20th century – present===
In 1933, historian Cecil Roth argued that a different type of mock crucifixion may have led to the accusations against Jews, because of the traditional mock execution of Haman enacted by Medieval Provençal Jews during the festival of Purim. In 1964, Marion Anderson developed this idea, suggesting that William had been told not to associate with Jews following one such masquerade; he died after being tortured by the Jews to find out why they were being ostracised.

In 1984, Canadian Medievalist Gavin I. Langmuir endorsed a theory that the murder was a sex crime, probably perpetrated by the self-described &quot;cook&quot;, noting that Thomas of Monmouth&#x27;s account would imply that William&#x27;s body was naked below the waist. Langmuir dismissed previous theories, adding that Theobald appeared to have been in Cambridge when the murder was committed. The theory that Theobald killed William was revived in 1988 by Zefirah Rokeah. It has been suggested that the killer was an unknown sadist, while the accusation of the Jews was made by William&#x27;s family, who may have been prejudiced against them, including hatred of Jews in general, hatred of the Jews for being foreigners allied with the Normans, and hopes for gaining the local Jews&#x27; wealth for themselves. Raphael Langham, writing in 2005, believed that Theobald was a disturbed individual with a hatred of his own community and thus the most likely killer. In &quot;The Murder of William of Norwich&quot; (2015), the medieval historian and journalist E. M. Rose points out that a botched road robbery or kidnapping, which was a frequent cause of death in the region during this period, could explain William&#x27;s death.

Writing in 1938, Jacob R. Marcus commented on the legacy of William of Norwich and other alleged cases like his: &quot;Generations have believed that no Christian child was safe in Jewish hands. Hundreds of Jews have been imprisoned, killed, or burned alive on this charge. The Papacy has frequently denounced this charge, yet it is equally true that in numerous instances the accusation of ritual murder was not made except with the vigorous support of local Church authorities. The author, Thomas of Monmouth, a monk in the Norwich Benedictine monastery, was an exceptionally credulous person. Jessop, one of the editors of Thomas&#x27;s work, believes that our monkish author belongs to the class of those who are &#x27;deceivers and being deceived&#x27;. In the specific case of William of Norwich, the evidence, critically sifted, leads one to believe that he &quot;actually existed&quot; and that his body &quot;was&quot; found after he had died a violent death. Everything beyond this, however, is in the realm of speculation.&quot;

<doc id="557204" wikidata="Q19859714" url="?curid=557204" title="Tyndall">
<text>Tyndall (the original spelling, also Tyndale, &quot;Tindol&quot;, Tyndal, Tindoll, Tindall, Tindal, Tindale, Tindle, Tindell, Tindill, and Tindel) is the name of an English family taken from the land they held as tenants in chief of the Kings of England and Scotland in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries: Tynedale, or the valley of the Tyne, in Northumberland. With origins in the ancient Anglo Saxon nobility of Northumbria, the Royal Scottish House of Dunkeld and the Anglo-Norman nobility, they have contributed courtiers, judges, writers, historians, sailors, airmen, scientists and philosophers to the history of England, Ireland and the new world. Two members of the family were offered, and declined, the throne of Bohemia in the 15th century and one of their number, William Tyndale, was the first modern translator of the Bible into English and one of the most important figures in the evolution of the modern language. The family is spread today throughout the British Isles and the English speaking world.

==Origins==

The first documented Lord of Tyndale, from which the Tyndall family derive their name, was Uchtred or Huctred Fitz Waltheof, who married Bethoc, daughter of Donald III, King of Scots from 1093 to 1099. His daughter Hextilda married Richard Comyn, and this connection served as the basis for John Comyn II of Badenoch to put forward a claim to the Scottish crown.

===Barony of Tindale===
The earliest feudal records indicate that an Adam de Tindale was the feudal Baron of South Tyne-dale and of Langeley/Langley Castle, both in the county of Northumberland. Adam was succeeded by his son, Adam, who held the Barony during the reign of Richard I of England. He left two daughters, who became co-heirs to the Tindale Barony and to Langley Castle. The elder, Philippa, married Adam Nicholas de Bolteby and conveyed to her husband the Barony of South Tyne-dale. It passed through inheritance in the female line to the family of Lucy and, later, to the Earls of Northumberland. The Barony of Langley and its associated manor continue to modern times as an originally feudal Prescriptive Barony (not a Peerage), and an extensive series of baronial and manorial records are maintained in the National Archives (UK).

===&quot;Tindale&quot; in the Peerage===
The Parliamentary Barony, Baron Scott of Tindale in Northumberland, was created in 1663 for the ill-fated Duke of Monmouth, and 1st Duke of Buccleuch, James Scott, the illegitimate son of King Charles II. This title was put under attainder, upon his execution for treason in 1685, but later restored, together with the Earldom of Doncaster in 1743. There is, however, a legend that King James II did not have him executed but exiled to France, where he became known as the Man in the Iron Mask.

Another Barony of Tyndale was created in 1688 as the junior title of the Radclyffe Earl of Derwentwater and in 1716 fell under attainder on his execution for treason for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.

==From the Middle Ages to the early modern era==
The second son of the first Baron Adam de Tindale, Robert, settled at Tansover in Northamptonshire in the time of Edward I. Some of the (later) genealogies and secondary sources for the family from this period are written in English and use &#x27;Tyndale&#x27;, for the reasons posited above. The more contemporary &#x27;Visitation of Essex&#x27; uses &#x27;Tyndall&#x27;, a spelling used below.

The first that is known of the family after their migration to Northamptonshire was the enlargement of their estates through marriage into the Deane family. The Deanes were, from the earliest generations, intimately connected with the Tyndall family. The elder son of Robert de Tyndall of Talsover married the heiress of that family and inherited the lands of Deane, which remained in the family for many generations. The Deane arms have been quartered with those of Tyndall ever since and were adopted as the only arms of the Tindal branch of the family from the 17th century (and can be seen, below, under the portrait of Rev Nicolas Tindal).

===The Tyndalls at court===
Subsequent Tyndalls married well, inheriting the estates of Hockwald in Norfolk and Mapplestead Magna in Essex in marriages with heiresses of the de Montford and Fermor families. Several heads of the family were knighted and many appear to have been prominent at court. A William Tyndall was Lancaster Herald under King Edward IV. Sir William Tyndall of Hockwald and Deane was created Knight Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath on 29 November 1489, on the creation of Prince Arthur as Prince of Wales in the reign of Henry VII. He was a Herald of the King, first as Guisne Pursuivant and later as Rouge Dragon.

His son, Sir Thomas Tyndall, was admitted to the Order of the Bath following the coronation of Queen Anne Boleyn. Through marriage to the Felstead family, he became co-heir to the Barony of Scales, the daughter of the last Baron Scales having died without issue. He shared this distinction with the then Earl of Oxford.

===The Tyndall Family and the Throne of Bohemia===
When King Richard II married Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, she brought with her cousin, Princess Margaret of Teschen, daughter of Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Teschen in modern Silesia by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Bolesław, Duke of Koźle and Bytom. This lady married Sir Simon Bigod de Felbrigg in Essex, the standard bearer of Richard II and their daughter, Alana, married Sir William Tyndall of Deene.

It has already been related that, through the Felbriggs, the Tyndalls came to be co-heirs to the Barony of Scales with the Earls of Oxford. However, a more regal dignity descended through Margaret of Teschen when the House of Luxemburg died out with the death of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia (1368–1437) and Sir William Tyndall became one of the heirs to the elective throne of Bohemia. John Nichols relates that a delegation of Bohemian boyars were sent to England to offer him the throne but that he refused, the Habsburgs succeeding to a throne they held (with one interruption) until 1918.
There was an oral tradition at the University of Cambridge that Humphrey Tyndall, brother of Sir John Tyndall of Mapplestead and uncle (or great uncle) of the eminent deist Dr Matthew Tindal, was again offered the throne by the Protestant party in Bohemia in 1620. This Humphrey was Dean of Ely and president of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. Humphrey refused, saying that &quot;he had rather be Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s subject than a foreign Prince&quot;, leading to the ill-fated Frederick V, Elector Palatine (married to Elizabeth, daughter of James I) becoming King for a year – a development that was a principal cause of the thirty years war. However, Humphrey Tyndall died in 1614.

===William Tyndale===
The most eminent member of the family, William Tyndale (c. 1494 – 1536), was the first translator of the Bible into modern English. His great work was also one of the first vernacular Bibles to be derived from the primary Hebrew and Greek texts. Its effect on the English church was electrifying, leading to thousands of Bibles being smuggled into England; Tyndale&#x27;s individual contribution to the linguistic development of the modern English language perhaps ranks as second only to that of Shakespeare. Aside from his life work, Tyndale was a prodigious pamphleteer, propounding a Protestant agenda that was significantly more radical than that of his protector, Martin Luther. His radicalism, prodigious output and written battles with Thomas More eventually led to his capture near Antwerp, after which he was burnt at the stake as a heretic. He is regarded as a martyr in the Church of England and his death is commemorated in the Book of Common Prayer.

Born in Gloucestershire, William Tyndale is known to have been the brother of Edward Tyndale of Pull Court, Gloucestershire, receiver to the lands of Lord Berkeley based on the 1533 letter of Bishop Stokesley of London. However, all that can be surmised from data available is that William was related to Richard Tyndale and Tabitha Hitchins of Melksham Court and had brothers John and Edward, the Receiver of Berkley, but most certainly was NOT of the line of Tyndale of Hockwold. (Although Edward Tyndale is recorded in two genealogies as having been the &#x27;brother of Sir William de Tyndall of Deane and Hockwold&#x27; but that William died after 1542 so they were in error on the relationship with that William (but suggesting that he was connected to this branch of the family somehow), that myth was broken and the suggestion dismissed in &quot;The Memoirs of the extinct family of Chesters of Chicheley&quot; as well as in &quot;The Genealogy of the Family of Tyndale&quot; (by B. W. Greenfield, 1843) and &quot;The Biography of William Tyndale&quot;.)

===Ralph Dundas Tindal, a Napoleonic and later Dutch Baron===
General (Deventer, 24 February 1773, – Zeist, 4 August 1834) served in the Netherlands military, and in French service. His father (whose family was of Scottish origin) had emigrated to Holland and had also served in Dutch service. Whilst in French imperial service, Ralph Dundas Tindal was created Baron de Tindal on 12 April 1813 by the French Emperor Napoleon (Bonaparte). Later he joined Dutch forces and became lieutenant-general in the infantry, and on 8 July 1815, King William I of the Netherlands bestowed a knightly order on him, the Willems-Orde. On 16 September 1815 he was raised in the Dutch nobility, again with the title baron.

==The Tindal/Tindal-Carill-Worsley family==

===Derivation===
The senior branch of the English Tyndall family, last seated at Mapplestead Magna in the 17th century, died out in the direct male line in the 17th century and in the female line over a hundred years later. The senior English branch is thus the Tindal (now Tindal-Carill-Worsley) family, whose history is related in the 1973 volume of Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry. This family derived from Rev John Tindal, rector of Bere Ferris, Devon, in the mid-17th century, said (in the Nichols genealogy) to have been the younger son of Sir John Tyndall of Mapplestead, the brother of Dean Humphrey Tyndall, president of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

There is, however, support for the contention that Rev. John was the son of Sir John&#x27;s elder son Dean. Rev John&#x27;s migration to Devon (after his studies for Holy Orders) was typical of the many migrations of the Tyndall/Tyndale/Tindal/Tindell family since the late 15th century. The use of &#x27;Tindal&#x27; represents a more Latinised usage which was common amongst many literary figures in this era and there is evidence that it was first used by his sons, Matthew (1657–1733), Thomas (1658–1714) and Richard (1659–1697). Matthew had been described as &#x27;Tyndall&#x27; when at Oxford University in 1688; two of his brothers, Thomas and Richard, emigrated to Fenwick&#x27;s Colony in 1674 and his other brother, John, was the father of Rev Nicolas Tindal (see below). . Rev John Tindal married Ann Hals, who was descended from the Fortescue and Clifford families and was the first cousin of Thomas, Lord Clifford, Lord High Treasurer of England to Charles II. Through this connection and those of Diana Pocklington, the wife of Capt George Tindal, RN, Lord Chief Justice Tindal (see below) was descended from Lords Chief Justices Sir William Yelverton and Sir John Fortescue and from Sir Roger Manwood, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.

===Philosopher, historian and judge===

Dr Matthew Tindal (1657–1733), a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life, was an important figure in the early English Enlightenment. Born during the Commonwealth to the above-mentioned Rev John Tindal, he appears to have been an opportunist in his youth, turning to Rome under James II. However, he later wrote the foundation of English deist thought, &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;, later known as the &quot;Deist&#x27;s Bible&quot;. This seminal tract, which had enduring influence on German deism in particular, represented that no true religion could rely on any doctrines that could not be divined through human reason. Thus, Christianity, if a true religion, has no need of revelation to support its dogmas and must be as old as the Creation. His writings provoked scandal and his book was burned by the public hangman, in addition to provoking a number of replies.

Dr Tindal&#x27;s nephew, Rev Nicolas Tindal (1687–1774), was the translator and continuer of the History of England by Paul de Rapin. Very few comprehensive histories existed at the time and Tindal wrote a three volume &quot;Continuation&quot;, a history of the Kingdom from the reign of James II to that of George II. Something of a controversialist, he was also known for having been defrauded of his uncle&#x27;s inheritance by Eustace Brugnell, leading to some lines of Alexander Pope. Rector of two livings, Chaplain of Greenwich Hospital and a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, Tindal was sufficiently prosporous to allow his son, Capt George Tindal RN to settle in Coval Hall, Chelmsford.

Capt George Tindal&#x27;s grandson, Rev William Tindal (1756–1804), was a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford and chaplain of the Tower of London. An antiquarian, he published a history of Evesham Abbey.

Another of George&#x27;s grandsons, Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal (1776–1846), was Lord Chief Justice from 1829 to 1845. His career first came to public notice when he acted for Queen Caroline in the famous attempt of George IV to divorce her in the House of Lords. Shortly afterwards, he was elected to Parliament, serving as Solicitor General for five years. Whilst Lord Chief Justice, he sat in the famous case of Daniel M&#x27;Naghten, who had attempted to assassinate Robert Peel, and derived from the common law the defence of insanity.

Sir Nicolas&#x27;s second son, Vice Admiral Louis Symonds Tindal (1810–1876), joined the Royal Navy as a boy, in 1825 and had an adventurous, wide-ranging and distinguished career. Promoted lieutenant in 1832, by 1836 he was in the sloop &#x27;Vestal&#x27; on the North American station and later the sloop &#x27;Calliope&#x27; on the South American station. In 1841 he was in China, where he was present at the Battle of Chuenpi, the storming of Wampea reach and at attacks on Canton. In recognition of his role in these raids, he was promoted commander that year and given command of the sloop &#x27;Pylades&#x27;, which he brought home from the east in 1843. In 1846 he commanded the brig-sloop &#x27;Grecian&#x27; to open the South American station, returning in 1849. He was promoted captain in 1852, rear-admiral in 1868 and vice-admiral in 1874.

===Australian Tindals===
Sir Nicolas&#x27;s youngest brother, Charles, a commander in the Royal Navy, became Governor of the Bank of England in the west of England. His son, Charles Grant Tindal (1823–1914) was a successful cattle breeder, meat processor and landowner. Having started his career on explorations of New South Wales, he leased a cattle station before buying the Ramornie station on the Orana River, near Grafton in NSW. In addition to cattle breeding, he was a highly successful breeder of racehorses, both in Australia and England, where he retained his father&#x27;s property of Fir Grove, Hampshire. At its peak, Charles&#x27;s meat processing company slaughtered 35,000 beasts a year and was well established on the English market.

Charles&#x27;s descendants remain in Australia to this day (although several Australian Tyndalls descend from the Irish branch of the family). One, Wing Cdr Archibald Tindal, who was killed during the bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942, became the first RAAF airman to be killed on the Australian mainland during World War II. After the war, &quot;Carson&#x27;s Airfield&quot;, located approximately south-east from Darwin, was renamed RAAF Base &quot;Tindal&quot; in his honour.

===Modern era===

Sir Nicolas ultimately left no descendants in the male line, though a branch of the Bosanquet family are his descendants and Reginald Bosanquet, the broadcaster for ITN, was his great great grandson. Members of the main branch of the English family descend from his brother, Thomas Tindal of Aylesbury, Clerk of the Peace for Buckinghamshire. He married Anne, the daughter of Acton Chaplin, Clerk of the Peace for Buckinghamshire. Chaplin was a great great grandson of Sir Francis Chaplin, Lord Mayor of London in 1677 and the great grandfather of Sir Arthur Havelock, Governor of Sierra Leone and Tasmania. Thomas&#x27;s son, Acton Tindal, Lord of the Manor of Aylesbury, married Henrietta Euphemia Harrison, an eminent poet and descendant of Francis Turner, one of the seven Bishops to defy James II and his Declaration of Indulgences, Sir Francis Windebank, Secretary of State to Charles I, and Sir Edmund Plowden, the eminent Elizabethan jurist. Acton&#x27;s son, Nicolas, married Elizabeth Carill-Worsley, heiress of Platt Hall near Manchester and the family adopted the name Tindal-Carill-Worsley. Elizabeth was a descendant of Erasmus Darwin, the 2nd Earl of Portmore, the Lord Monteagle who foiled the Gunpowder Plot and Charles Worsley of Platt, one of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s most trusted Major Generals, to whom was entrusted the Mace when Cromwell famously cried &#x27;rid me of that bauble&#x27; in expelling the House of Commons in 1652.

The current head of the English family is Charles Tindal of Ballyloughan (he does not use &#x27;Carill-Worsley&#x27;), son of Group Captain Nicolas Tindal-Carill-Worsley (1911–2006), a bomber pilot during World War II and one of the organisers of the &quot;Great Escape&quot; from Stalag Luft III. His brother, Anthony, son, Matthew and niece and nephew William and Harriet together run Tindal Wines in England and Ireland.

==Irish branch and distinguished individuals==

===Derivation===
A branch of the family settled in Ireland in the Middle Ages, and manuscript genealogical records of these exist in Trinity College Dublin. The family originated in Gloucestershire and were closely related to William Tyndale, the Bible translator. Another William Tyndall is mentioned in the 1659 census as living in Duganstowne, Catherlagh (County Carlow), co-owned by him and a Richard Andrewes as tituladoes. Similarly, a John Tyndall came from Gloucestershire to Ireland during the Wars of Rebellion and had a grant of land confirmed to him in 1668. He married Isabelle de Rinzy of County Wexford.

Amongst the landed gentry in Ireland in the 19th century, Tyndalls appeared established with estates and seats at Ballyanne House, and Berkeley Forest, both in New Ross, County Wexford, and Prospect Hall, County Kilkenny, as well as in County Carlow, and Kildevin, County Westmeath, and Dublin City. Samuel Tyndall served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1826 to 1827. E.L. Tyndall was a Knight Grand Cordon, 6th Class, of the Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan (founded by the Emperor Meiji (Mutsuhito) on 8 January 1888)

===Prominent Irish Tyndalls===

John Tyndall (1820–1893) from Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland, a staunch Protestant Unionist, was a well-known physicist from Ireland, who discovered the Tyndall effect. A relative, another John Tyndall of Newcastle ran a forge, coachmaking and saddlery, in the middle of the 19th century, and his grandson, David P. Tyndall (1890–1970), from Chapelizod, became a prominent Irish businessman in the 20th century, who founded the firm D. Tyndall &amp; Sons, as well as several other companies, and consolidated and modernised the wholesale trade sector, introducing the SPAR chain into Ireland.

John Hutchyns Tyndall (1934–2005) born Exeter, Devon, England, was a British politician who was involved in a number of nationalist movements in post-war Britain, best known for leading the National Front in the 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. His paternal family were Protestant Unionists from County Waterford, his ancestors having settled in Ireland in the 16th century. His grandfather had been a district inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary.

Other lines of the Irish branch of the family have spread to Australia and the USA.

==Tyndall-named institutions and places==
* England: The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has locations in the University of East Anglia in Norwich, the University of Manchester, the University of Southampton, the University of Sussex in Brighton, Oxford University, and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. &#x27;Tindal Square&#x27; in Chelmsford is named after Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal. &#x27;Tindal Hospital&#x27;, Aylesbury, is named after the family of Thomas and Acton Tindal, Lords of the Manor of Aylesbury. A branch of the Tyndall family settled in Bristol, and created Tyndalls Park in the 18th century; they built Royal Fort House, now part of the campus of the University of Bristol: there is a Tyndall lecture theatre and, nearby, a road named Tyndall Avenue.
* Republic of Ireland: In honour of physicist John Tyndall, the Tyndall National Institute was created in Ireland in 2004 at the initiative of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and University College Cork (UCC) to bring together complementary activities in photonics, electronics and networking research at the National Microelectronics Research Centre (NMRC), several UCC academic departments and Cork Institute of Technology (CIT).
* New Zealand: The Tyndall name has lent itself to an important investment fund management enterprise.
* USA: Tyndall Air Force Base, named for World War I flying ace Lt. Frank B. Tyndall, is located in Bay County, Florida. The small city of Tyndall, South Dakota, named for John Tyndall, is the county seat of Bon Homme County. Tyndall Glacier in Colorado is also named after John Tyndall.
* Australia: Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal, in the Northern Territory is named after Wing Cmdr Archibald Tindal, the first Australian airman to be killed on the Australian mainland in World War II (see above under Tindal/Tindal-Carill-Worsley family).
* Canada: The town of Tyndall, Manitoba. Tyndall stone is the name of a limestone often used in construction and decoration in Manitoba.

==In The United States==

Richard Tindall continued as surveyor-general of Fenwick&#x27;s Colony following the sale of the Salem Tenth to William Penn in 1682. His brother Thomas Tindall was the first purchaser of land in Hopewell, New Jersey and had many children.

* Tindall, Missouri is named for Union Army colonel Jacob T. Tindall.

First Lieutenant (Air Service) Frank Benjamin Tyndall, United States Army Air Service flew as an ace fighter pilot with 22d Aero Squadron. By direction of the president, under the provisions of the act of Congress approved 9 July 1918 (Bul. No. 43, W.D., 1918), LT. Frank B. Tyndall is cited by the commanding general, American Expeditionary Forces, for gallantry in action and a Silver Star may be placed upon the ribbon of the Victory Medals awarded him. First Lieutenant Tyndall distinguished himself by gallantry in action while serving with the 22d Aero Squadron, American Expeditionary Forces, in action near Conflans, France, 29 October 1918, in pursuing an enemy Fokker far within the enemy&#x27;s lines and bringing it down. After the war was over he worked with Boeing on loan from the government as a consultant and test pilot. During one of his test flights his plane had a mechanical failure and he had to bail out. As a result, he was the second Airman to successfully survive using a parachute. He died 15 July 1930 after the plane he was flying crashed. Ten years later Tyndall Air Force Base was named in his honour. He was survived by his wife Grace Tyndall and his daughter Mary Tyndall.

<text>STS-90 was a 1998 Space Shuttle mission flown by the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The 16-day mission marked the last flight of the European Space Agency&#x27;s Spacelab laboratory module, which had first flown on &quot;Columbia&quot; on STS-9, and was also the last daytime landing for &quot;Columbia&quot;.

==Mission highlights==
Neurolab was a Spacelab module mission focusing on the effects of microgravity on the nervous system. The goals of Neurolab were to study basic research questions and to increase the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for neurological and behavioral changes in space. Specifically, experiments would study the adaptation of the vestibular system and space adaptation syndrome, the adaptation of the central nervous system and the pathways which control the ability to sense location in the absence of gravity, and the effect of microgravity on a developing nervous system. The science lead was Mary Anne Frey.

The mission was a joint venture of six space agencies and seven U.S. research agencies. Investigator teams from nine countries would conduct 31 studies in the microgravity environment of space. Other agencies participating in the mission included six institutes of the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research, as well as the space agencies of Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, and the European Space Agency.

Neurolab&#x27;s 26 experiments targeted one of the most complex and least understood parts of the human body – the nervous system. Primary goals were to conduct basic research in neurosciences and expand understanding of how the nervous system develops and functions in space. Test subjects were rats, mice, crickets, snails, two kinds of fish and the crew members themselves. Cooperative effort of NASA, several domestic partners and the space agencies of Canada (CSA), France (CNES) and Germany (DLR), as well as the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). Most experiments conducted in pressurized Spacelab long module located in &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s payload bay. This was the 16th and last scheduled flight of the ESA-developed Spacelab module although Spacelab pallets would continue to be used on the International Space Station.

Research conducted as planned, with the exception of the Mammalian Development Team, which had to reprioritize science activities because of the unexpected high mortality rate of neonatal rats on board.

Other payloads included the Shuttle Vibration Forces experiment, the Bioreactor Demonstration System-04, and three Get-Away Special (GAS) canister investigations.

STS-90 was the first mission to make an Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) assist burn during the ascent.

Three of the seven STS-90 crew (Williams, Pawelczyk and Buckey) appeared on the Canadian television series &quot;Popular Mechanics for Kids&quot;. Working with engineers on the ground a week into the flight, the on-orbit crew used aluminum tape to bypass a suspect valve in the Regenerative Carbon Dioxide Removal System that had threatened to cut short the mission.

Mission Management Team considered, but decided against, extending the mission one day because the science community indicated an extended flight was not necessary and weather conditions were expected to deteriorate after planned landing on Sunday, 3 May.

STS-90 Mission Specialist Kathryn Hire was Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s first employee to be chosen as an astronaut candidate.

STS-90 was the second shuttle flight where a bat was observed landing on the External Tank (the first being STS-72), but it flew away just after main engine start. Another bat was observed landing on the External Tank during STS-119, but remained on the tank during liftoff.

<text>STS-91 was the 24th flight of Discovery, and the final Space Shuttle mission to the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. It was flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, and launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 2 June 1998.

==Mission highlights==
STS-91 marked the final Shuttle/&quot;Mir&quot; Docking Mission, as well as the only such docking for &quot;Discovery&quot;. This Phase 1 Program was a precursor to the International Space Station maintaining a continuous American presence in space and developing the procedures and hardware required for an international partnership in space.

The mission was the first to use the super lightweight external tank (SLWT) which was the same size, at long and in diameter, as the external tank used on previous launches, but lighter. The tank was made of an aluminium lithium alloy and the tank&#x27;s structural design had also been improved making it 30 percent stronger and 5 percent less dense. The walls of the redesigned hydrogen tank were machined in an orthogonal waffle-like pattern, providing more strength and stability than the previous design. These improvements would later provide additional payload capacity to the International Space Station.

Docking of &quot;Discovery&quot; to Mir, the first for that orbiter, occurred at 16:01 UTC, 4 June 1998 at an altitude of 208 miles. Hatches opened at 2:34 pm the same day. At hatch opening, Andy Thomas officially became a member of &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s crew, completing 130 days of living and working on Mir. The transfer wrapped up a total of 907 days spent by seven U.S. astronauts aboard the Russian space station as long-duration crew members. During the next four days, the Mir 25 and STS-91 crews transferred more than of water, and almost of cargo experiments and supplies were exchanged between the two spacecraft. During this time, long-term U.S. experiments aboard the Mir were moved into &quot;Discovery&quot;″s middeck locker area and the SPACEHAB single module in the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay, including the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and the tissue engineering co-culture (COCULT) investigations, as well as two crystal growth experiments. The crews also conducted Risk Mitigation Experiments (RMEs) and Human Life Sciences (HLS) investigations. When the hatches closed for undocking at 9:07 am, 8 June, and the spacecraft separated at 12:01 pm that day, the final Shuttle-Mir docking mission was concluded and Phase 1 of the International Space Station (ISS) program came to an end. 

STS-91 also carried a prototype of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) into space. The AMS, designed to look for dark and missing matter in the universe, was powered up on Flight Day 1. Data originally planned to be sent to ground stations through &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s Ku-band communications system was recorded on board because of a problem with the Ku-band system that prevented it from sending high-rate communications, including television signals, to the ground. The system was able to receive uplink transmissions. On 3 June 1998 the crew was able to set up a bypass system that allowed AMS data to be downlinked via S-band/FM communications when the orbiter came within range of a ground station. Data that could not be recorded by ground stations was recorded on board throughout the mission.

The Ku-band system failure was determined to be located in a component that was not accessible to the crew. The failure prevented television transmission throughout the mission. Television broadcasts from Mir were prevented by a problem between a Russian ground station and the mission control center outside Moscow, limiting communications to audio only on NASA television.

Other experiments conducted by the Shuttle crew during the mission included a checkout of the orbiter&#x27;s robot arm to evaluate new electronics and software and the Orbiter Space Vision System for use during assembly missions for the ISS. Also on board in the payload bay were eight Get Away Special experiments, while combustion, crystal growth and radiation monitoring experiments were conducted in &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s mid-deck crew cabin area.

<text>STS-95 was a Space Shuttle mission launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on 29 October 1998, using the orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. It was the 25th flight of &quot;Discovery&quot; and the 92nd mission flown since the start of the Space Shuttle program in April 1981. It was a highly publicized mission due to former Project Mercury astronaut and United States Senator John H. Glenn Jr.&#x27;s return to space for his second space flight. At age 77, Glenn became the oldest person to go into space, a record that remained unbroken for 23 years until 82-year-old Wally Funk flew on a suborbital flight on Blue Origin NS-16, launching on 20 July 2021, which in turn was broken by William Shatner at age 90 on 13 October 2021 and then by Ed Dwight on May 19, 2024. Glenn, however, remains the oldest person to reach Earth orbit. This mission is also noted for inaugurating ATSC HDTV broadcasting in the U.S., with live coast-to-coast coverage of the launch. In another first, Pedro Duque became the first Spaniard in space.

The mission&#x27;s objectives involved investigating life-sciences experiments, using the SpaceHab module to perform these experiments on Senator Glenn. Scientific objectives on this mission were not limited to furthering an understanding of the human body, but also to increase astronomical understanding with regards to the Sun, and how it affects life on Earth. The Spartan 201 spacecraft was released by the crew, flying free from the Shuttle, studying the acceleration of the solar wind that originates in the Sun&#x27;s solar corona. The mission lasted just under ten days, with &quot;Discovery&quot; completing its voyage by landing at the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility.

The launch was rare in that the official launch weather forecast provided by the 45th Weather Squadron was 100 percent for favorable weather for launch as well as the Shuttle Landing Facility.

Bill Clinton became the second sitting U.S. president to witness a crewed space launch, joined by his wife Hillary on the roof of the Launch Control Center, and the only one to witness a Space Shuttle launch (President Richard Nixon witnessed the launch of Apollo 12).

==Crew==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==


The primary objectives included conducting a variety of science experiments in the pressurized Spacehab module, the deployment and retrieval of the Spartan free-flyer payload, and operations with the HST Orbital Systems Test (HOST) and the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH) payloads carried in the payload bay.

===Spacehab===
The Spacehab module flown on STS-95 was provided by Spacehab, Inc., a private company. The Spacehab system provided additional pressurized workspace for experiments, cargo and crew activities. Spacehab modules supported various Shuttle science missions along with several of the joint Shuttle-Mir missions.

For STS-95, a single-module Spacehab flew in the forward portion of &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s payload bay, with the crew gaining access to the module through the airlock tunnel system. A variety of experiments sponsored by NASA, the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) focused on life sciences, microgravity sciences and advanced technology during the flight.

===Spartan===
The Spartan 201-5 free-flyer was deployed and retrieved using the Shuttle&#x27;s mechanical arm. It was designed to investigate physical conditions and processes of the hot outer layers of the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, or solar corona. While deployed from the Shuttle, Spartan gathered measurements of the solar corona and solar wind. NASA expected that information collected during this mission would lead to a much better understanding of the solar winds that directly influence orbiting satellites and weather conditions on Earth which in turn impact television and phone communications. This was the fifth flight for the Spartan payload; it originally flew on the STS-56 mission in April 1993. 
On its previous mission, STS-87 in November 1997, Spartan developed problems shortly after being deployed from the Shuttle and had to be brought back into the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay by spacewalk. These problems were due with the attitude control system for fine pointing toward solar targets, and Spartan was cleared for use again on STS-95. Its mission was to successfully perform the same experiments from the previous year.

===HOST===
The Hubble Space Telescope Orbital Systems Test (HOST) platform carried experiments to validate components planned for installation during the third Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and to evaluate new technologies in an earth orbiting environment. There were four experiments on the HOST platform. The NICMOS Cooling System allowed for zero-g verification of a reverse turbocharged Brayton cycle cooler, which allowed for longer life operation than the dewar system used on Hubble at the time. The HST 486 computer allowed for the identification of any radiation-susceptible parts in the DF-224 replacement computer to be carried on the third servicing mission, and demonstrate hardware and software responses to Single Event Upsets (SEUs). A solid state recorder compared on-orbit operation of the flight-spare solid state recorder with the unit installed in Hubble. A fiber optic line test used the same 4 kbit/s data stream that was sent to the orbiter&#x27;s Payload Data Interrogator (PDI) and routed to a laptop computer for post-flight comparison.

===IEH===
The International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH) payload involved a half dozen different experiments mounted on a support structure which was carried in &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s payload bay. The six experiments that made up the IEH payload were the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (SEH) payload, which obtained EUV and FUV fluxes that are required when studying the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere; an Ultraviolet Spectrograph Telescope for Astronomical Research (UVSTAR) payload designed to measure EUV fluxes which could be used to form images of extended plasma sources (ex. Jupiter, hot stars, etc.); the STAR-LITE payload which made observations of extended and diffused astrophysical targets; the CONCAP-IV payload designed to grow thin films via physical vapor transport; the Petite Amateur Navy Satellite (PANSAT) payload which was managed by the Department of Defense Space Test Program, and involved a small deployable satellite that stored and transmitted digital communications to PANSAT ground stations; and a Getaway Special (GAS) payload.

===Medical experiments on Glenn===
According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Glenn &quot;won his seat on the shuttle flight by lobbying NASA for two years to fly as a human guinea pig for geriatric studies&quot;, which were named as the main reasons for his participation in the STS-95 mission. This series of experiments conducted on Glenn during the mission was sponsored by NASA and the National Institute on Aging, and based on the fact that the aging process and a space flight experience share a number of similar physiological responses. The investigations were expected to gather information which may provide a model system to help scientists interested in understanding aging. Some of these similarities include bone and muscle loss, balance disorders and sleep disturbances. Shortly before the flight, researchers learned that Glenn had to be disqualified from another of the flight&#x27;s two main priority human experiments (about the effects of melatonin) because he did not meet one of study&#x27;s medical conditions; he still participated in two other experiments about sleep monitoring and protein use.
Data provided from Glenn during this mission was compared to data obtained from Glenn&#x27;s &quot;Friendship 7&quot; orbital mission in 1962.

===Trivia===

Glenn was the oldest person, and the third sitting member of Congress, to fly into space. He was preceded by U.S. Senator from Utah Jake Garn (STS-51-D) and U.S. Representative (later Senator) from Florida Bill Nelson (STS-61-C). At the time, Glenn was Ohio&#x27;s senior or ranking Senator. Other astronauts who later entered politics include Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17), later U.S. Senator from New Mexico, Jack Swigert (Apollo 13), who was elected to Congress in the state of Colorado but died before being sworn in, and U.S. Senator from Arizona Mark Kelly (STS-108, STS-121, STS-124, and STS-134).

In a reprise of his first space flight, while in orbit, Glenn was greeted again by the citizens of Perth and Rockingham in Australia. They left their private and municipal lights on while the &quot;Discovery&quot; passed overhead, just like they did during his &quot;Friendship 7&quot; flight.
This is the first mission wherein a Space Shuttle orbiter (&quot;Discovery&quot; in this mission) uses NASA&#x27;s meatball insignia on its markings. It replaced the worm logotype that all orbiters had. &quot;Endeavour&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Columbia&quot; would follow in their respective missions of STS-88, STS-101, and STS-109. Space Shuttle orbiters &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot; didn&#x27;t have this change, for &quot;Enterprise&quot; became the property of The Smithsonian in 1985 and &quot;Challenger&quot; was destroyed in 1986.

== Crew award ==
The crew of STS-95 was awarded the Space Foundation&#x27;s Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award in 1999. The award is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.

== Anomalies ==
The drag chute door detached and fell from the orbiter at main engine ignition. There was some concern that the drag chute could deploy prematurely prior to touchdown, and the decision was made not to use the chute during landing rollout. Wheel brakes and speedbrakes were sufficient to bring &quot;Discovery&quot; to a stop on Runway 33 at the Shuttle Landing Facility.

An RCS leak venting from a thruster on the left-hand OMS pod was observed in orbit. An isolation valve was used to disable the jet. Attitude control was maintained by system redundancy; there were 44 jets located around the orbiter.

==Inaugural HDTV broadcast==
The Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) provided live coverage of the lift-off as the public launch of the high-definition television system in the United States. The signal was transmitted coast-to-coast, and was seen by the public in science centers, and other public theaters specially equipped to receive and display the broadcast. The Harris Corporation provided the equipment necessary for transmitting and receiving the broadcast. The coverage was hosted by former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, and former Gemini/Apollo-era astronaut Pete Conrad.

==Wake-up calls==
NASA had begun a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen and often has a particular meaning to an individual member of the crew, or it is somehow applicable to their situation.

==Mission insignia==
The STS-95 mission insignia was designed by the crew, and evokes the scientific, engineering and historic elements of the flight.
It depicts a stylized blue Space Shuttle with yellow, red, and blue streamers coming from its stern that represent the global benefits of the mission&#x27;s science experiments and the solar science objectives of the Spartan satellite. A small Mercury space capsule is depicted orbiting the Shuttle, and the red streamer extends up towards the center of the Shuttle to form a &quot;7&quot;. The capsule and the number seven are in reference to Glenn&#x27;s historic association with the Mercury Seven astronauts and their spacecraft: all of the crewed Mercury spacecraft had &quot;7&quot; as part of their name. The mission payloads—microgravity material science, medical research for humans on Earth and in space, and astronomy—represent three major scientific fields and are symbolized in the insignia by rocket plumes.

<text>STS-88 was the first Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS). It was flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and took the first American module, the &quot;Unity&quot; node, to the station.

The seven-day mission was highlighted by the mating of the U.S.-built &quot;Unity&quot; node to the Functional Cargo Block (&quot;Zarya&quot; module) already in orbit, and three spacewalks to connect power and data transmission cables between the Node and the FGB. &quot;Zarya&quot;, built by Boeing and the Russian Space Agency, was launched on a Russian Proton rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in November 1998.

Other payloads on the STS-88 mission included the IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC), the Argentine Scientific Applications Satellite-S (SAC-A), the MightySat 1 Hitchhiker payload, the Space Experiment Module (SEM-07) and Getaway Special G-093 sponsored by the University of Michigan.

==Mission highlights==

Node 1, named &quot;Unity&quot;, was the first space station hardware delivered by the Space Shuttle. It has two Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA), one attached to either end. One PMA (PMA-1) is permanently mated to &quot;Zarya&quot;, and the other (PMA-2) is used for orbiter dockings and crew access to the station. &quot;Unity&quot; also contains an International Standard Payload Rack used to support on-orbit activities, which was activated after the fifth Shuttle/Station assembly flight.

To begin the assembly sequence, the crew conducted a series of rendezvous maneuvers similar to those conducted on other Shuttle missions to reach the orbiting FGB. On the way, Currie used the Shuttle&#x27;s robot arm to place Node 1 atop the Orbiter Docking System. Cabana completed the rendezvous by flying &quot;Endeavour&quot; to within of the FGB, allowing Currie to capture the FGB with the robot arm and place it on the Node&#x27;s Pressurized Mating Adapter.

Once the two elements were docked, Ross and Newman conducted two scheduled spacewalks to connect power and data cables between the Node, PMAs and the FGB. The day following the spacewalks, &quot;Endeavour&quot; undocked from the two components, completing the first Space Station assembly mission.

&quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s astronauts toured the new International Space Station on Thursday, 10 December 1998, entering the &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot; modules for the first time, and establishing an S-band communications system that enables U.S. flight controllers to monitor the outpost&#x27;s systems. Reflecting the international cooperation involved in building the largest space complex in history, Commander Robert Cabana and Russian Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev opened the hatch to the U.S.-built Unity connecting module and floated into the new station together.

The rest of the crew followed and began turning on lights and unstowing gear in the roomy hub to which other modules would be connected in the future. Each passageway within &quot;Unity&quot; was marked by a sign leading the way into tunnels to which new modules would later be connected.

About an hour later, Robert Cabana and Sergei Krikalev opened the hatch to the Russian-built Zarya control module, which was the nerve center for the station in its embryonic stage. Joined by Pilot Frederick Sturckow and Mission Specialists Jerry Ross, James H. Newman and Nancy Currie, Cabana and Krikalev hailed the historic entrance into the International Space Station and said the hatch opening signified the start of a new era in space exploration.

Ross and Newman went right to work in &quot;Unity&quot;, completing the assembly of an early S-band communications system that allows flight controllers in Houston to send commands to &quot;Unity&quot;″s systems and to keep tabs on the health of the station with a more extensive communications capability than exists through Russian ground stations. The astronauts also conducted a successful test of the videoconferencing capability of the early communications system, which was used by the first crew to permanently occupy the station in November 2000 (Expedition 1). Newman downlinked greetings to controllers in the station flight control room in Houston and to astronaut Bill Shepherd, who commanded the first crew and lived aboard the station with Krikalev and Cosmonaut Yuri Gidzenko.

Krikalev and Currie replaced a faulty unit in &quot;Zarya&quot; which controlled the discharging of stored energy from one of the module&#x27;s six batteries. The battery had not been working properly in its automatic configuration, but the new unit was functioning normally shortly after it was installed.

The astronauts also unstowed hardware and logistical supplies stored behind panels in &quot;Zarya&quot;, relocating the items for use by the Shuttle crew that was to visit the station in May 1999 and by Shepherd&#x27;s expedition crew. The astronauts also completed their initial outfitting of the station.

The hatches to &quot;Zarya&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot; were closed before &quot;Endeavour&quot; undocked from the new station, leaving the new complex to orbit the Earth unpiloted.

==Mission timeline==

===Launch preparations===
At 12:15 am EST on Monday, 23 June 1997, an Air Force C-5 air cargo plane arrived at the Shuttle Landing Facility carrying &quot;Unity&quot; (Node 1). On 1 February 1998, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was towed to Orbiter Processing Facility Bay 1. On 15 October 1998, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was moved from Orbiter Processing Facility Bay 1 to the Vehicle Assembly Building. On 21 October 1998, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was transported atop the Crawler Transporter to Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Pad 39A.

===3–4 December (Flight Day 1, Launch)===
Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; launched at 3:35:34 am EST from the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Pad 39A. STS-88 was the first shuttle flight to the International Space Station. After launch, the crew opened the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay doors, deployed the Ku-Band antenna, and activated the shuttle&#x27;s Hitchhiker payload. The crew also started preparing for the multiple engine firings that will be performed to bring shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; within the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System&#x27;s reach of the &quot;Zarya FGB&quot;. At launch, &quot;Zarya&quot; was 240 statute miles above the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the module was on its 222nd orbit of the Earth since its launch.

===4 December (Flight Day 2)===
On Flight Day 2, the crew of &quot;Endeavour&quot; performed several tasks to get ready for the docking on Sunday and the extra-vehicular activities (EVA) to be completed on the mission. Nancy Currie conducted a photo survey of &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s payload bay, using the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm, Canadarm. Jerry Ross and Jim Newman checked out the spacesuits they would use on the three EVAs and prepared the shuttle&#x27;s airlock for use during the spacewalks. Rick Sturckow, who would be choreographing the EVAs from inside the shuttle, joined Ross and Newman to check out the SAFER units to be worn during the spacewalks in case Ross or Newman were to become separated from &quot;Endeavour&quot; during one of the spacewalks.

===5 December (Flight Day 3)===
On Flight Day 3, Currie used Canadarm to grapple and place &quot;Unity&quot; onto the Orbiter Docking System at 6:45 pm EST. The crew pressurized PMA-2 and entered it. They put several caps over vent valves to prepare for the entrance into &quot;Unity&quot; later in the week. Commander Bob Cabana performed a debris avoidance maneuver to move &quot;Endeavour&quot; out of the way of a casing from a Delta II rocket that launched on 6 November from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

===6 December (Flight Day 4, Docking with Zarya)===
On Flight Day 4, Bob Cabana fired &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s rockets several times to maneuver the shuttle within Canadarm&#x27;s reach of the &quot;Zarya&quot; FGB. At 6:47 pm EST, Currie grappled &quot;Zarya&quot;. Later, at 9:07 pm EST, Cabana fired &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s downward jets to bring the two modules together.

===7 December (Flight Day 5, EVA 1)===
During a 7-hour, 21-minute spacewalk, astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman helped activate the &quot;Unity&quot; node, the first module to the U.S. segment of the International Space Station. They connected 40 connectors and cables running along the 35-ton, space station. At 10:49 pm EST, flight controllers in Houston saw &quot;Unity&quot;&#x27;s systems come on.

===8 December (Flight Day 6)===
On the 6th day of &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s STS-88 mission, Mission Specialists Jerry Ross and Jim Newman relaxed after their long spacewalk on Flight Day 5. Ross, Newman, Nancy Currie, and Sergei Krikalev prepared equipment for Flight Day 7&#x27;s EVA. Commander Bob Cabana and Pilot Rick Sturckow fired &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s main reaction control system jets for 22 minutes to raise the ISS approximately 5 statute miles. The crew conducted interviews with ABC News, Discovery Channel, and MSNBC.

===9 December (Flight Day 7, EVA 2)===
At 3:33 pm EST, Mission Specialists Jerry Ross and Jim Newman commenced on a 7-hour, 2-minute EVA to continue the installation of &quot;Unity&quot;. The two spacewalkers first installed two antennas on the outside of &quot;Unity&quot;. The astronauts also removed launch restraint pins on the four radial common berthing mechanisms of &quot;Unity&quot;. They installed covers on &quot;Unity&quot;&#x27;s two data relay boxes to protect them from sunlight. Lastly, Newman freed a backup rendezvous system antenna on the &quot;Zarya FGB&quot;.

===10 December (Flight Day 8, Entrance into the ISS)===
Flight Day 8 was a historic day as the International Space Station was opened for the first time on orbit. At 2:54 pm EST, Commander Bob Cabana and Russian Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev opened the hatch to the &quot;Unity&quot; Node of the new International Space Station. The other members of the crew started unstowing gear and turning on the lights. At 4:12 pm EST, Cabana and Krikalev opened the hatch into &quot;Zarya&quot;. Jerry Ross and Jim Newman assembled a S-band communications system in &quot;Unity&quot;, and Krikalev and Nancy Currie replaced a problematic battery discharging unit in &quot;Zarya&quot;.

===11 December (Flight Day 9)===
On Flight Day 9, Pilot Rick Sturckow and Mission Specialist Nancy Currie continued unstowing hardware in &quot;Unity&quot;. After turning off the lights, the crew later closed the hatches to &quot;Zarya&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot;. The crew prepared for the mission&#x27;s third and final spacewalk on Flight Day 10. &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s crew also conducted interviews with CNN and CBS News.

===12 December (Flight Day 10, EVA 3)===
At 3:33 pm EST, astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman commenced on a 6-hour, 59-minute EVA to finish the installation of the &quot;Unity&quot; Node to &quot;Zarya&quot;. The two stowed tools on the side of &quot;Unity&quot; to prepare for the spacewalks on STS-96, the next mission to the ISS. Ross also freed another antenna on &quot;Zarya&quot;, similar to the one Newman freed on EVA-2. The spacewalkers also tested the redesigned SAFER jet packs, to be used in the event an astronaut became separated from the spacecraft during a spacewalk. After the EVA, Pilot Rick Sturckow depressurized the vestibule between &quot;Endeavour&quot; and PMA-2 to prepare for the undocking of the two spacecraft on Flight Day 11.

===13 December (Flight Day 11, Undocking)===
On Flight Day 11, Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; undocked from the International Space Station. At 3:25 pm EST, Pilot Rick Sturckow backed &quot;Endeavour&quot; away from the station and started a nose-forward fly-around of the station, so that the crew could take pictures of the space station. At 4:49 pm EST, Sturckow performed a final separation burn. Later, the crew deployed SAC-A, a small satellite for the Argentinean National Commission of Space Activities.

===14 December (Flight Day 12)===
On the last full day on orbit, the crew deployed a small Air Force satellite called MightySat-1. The crew tested the orbiter&#x27;s aerosurfaces and steering jets to be used on landing day and stowed equipment.

===15 December (Flight Day 13, Landing)===
Flight Day 13 was landing day for Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; and its crew of six. At 7:07 pm EST, the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay doors were closed for entry. Flight Director John Shannon gave the go for the crew to fire the orbital maneuvering system engines for the deorbit burn at 9:46 pm EST so that &quot;Endeavour&quot; could slow down to enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. At 10:54 pm EST, &quot;Endeavour&quot; and crew landed on the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Runway 15. &quot;Endeavour&quot; wrapped up a 4.7 million mile mission, and the first to the International Space Station.

==Extra-vehicular activity==

Three extra-vehicular activity (EVA) spacewalks were scheduled and completed during STS-88.

==Wake-up calls==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15.
Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-96 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot; Discovery&quot;, and the first shuttle flight to dock at the International Space Station. It was Discovery&#x27;s 26th flight. The shuttle carried the Spacehab module in the payload, filled with cargo for station outfitting. STS-96 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 27 May 1999 at 06:49:42 AM EDT and returned to Kennedy on 6 June 1999, 2:02:43 AM EDT.

==Mission highlights==

STS-96 was a logistics and resupply mission for the International Space Station carrying the Spacehab Double Module (DM) 13th Spacehab overall (6th dual module use).

Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; carried to the ISS an Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC) with parts for the Russian cargo crane STRELA, which was mounted to the exterior of the Russian station segment. Furthermore, the ICC carried the SPACEHAB Oceaneering Space System Box (SHOSS) and the &quot;ORU Transfer Device&quot; (OTD), a U.S. built crane.

Other payloads on STS-96 were the Student Tracked Atmospheric Research Satellite for Heuristic International Networking Equipment (STARSHINE), the Shuttle Vibration Forces Experiment (SVF) and the Orbiter Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring – HEDS Technology Demonstration (IVHM HTD).

The STARSHINE satellite consists of an inert, hollow sphere covered by 1,000 evenly distributed, flat, polished mirrors, each 1 inch in diameter. The payload consists of the STARSHINE satellite, integrated with the Pallet Ejection System (PES), then mounted inside a lidless carrier. The HH equipment consists of one HH Lightweight Avionics Plate (LAP), then mounted inside a lidless carrier. Additional HH equipment consists of one Hitchhiker Ejection System Electronics (HESE), one 5.0 cubic-foot (142 L) HH canister, and one Adapter Beam Assembly (ABA). The purpose of the mission was to train international student volunteer observers to visually track this optically reflective spacecraft during morning and evening twilight intervals for several months, calculate its orbit from shared observations, and derive atmospheric density from drag-induced changes in its orbit over time.
The Shuttle Vibration Forces (SVF) Experiment provided flight measurements of the vibratory forces acting between an aerospace payload and its mounting structure. The force transducers were incorporated into four custom brackets which replaced the existing brackets used to attach the 5 ft (1.5 m) standard canister to the side wall GAS adapter beam. The payload was activated automatically by the Orbiter Lift-off vibration and operated for approximately 100 seconds. STS-96 was the second flight of the SVF experiment.

The purpose of the Orbiter Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring- HEDS Technology Demonstration (IVHM HTD) was to demonstrate competing modern, off-the-shelf sensing technologies in an operational environment to make informed design decisions for the eventual Orbiter upgrade IVHM. The objective of IVHM was to reduce planned ground processing, streamline problem troubleshooting (unplanned ground processing), enhance visibility into systems operation and improve overall vehicle safety.

A copy of Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;StarCraft&quot; real-time strategy game was also flown aboard STS-96. It resides at Blizzard&#x27;s headquarters in Irvine, California.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15.
Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

==Mission highlights==

The primary objective of STS-103 was the Hubble Servicing Mission 3A. STS-103 had four scheduled Extravehicular Activity (EVA) days where four crew members worked in pairs on alternating days to renew and refurbish the telescope.

NASA officials decided to move up part of the servicing mission that had been scheduled for June 2000 after three of the telescope&#x27;s six gyroscopes failed. Three gyroscopes must be working to meet the telescope&#x27;s very precise pointing requirements, and the telescope&#x27;s flight rules dictated that NASA consider a &quot;call-up&quot; mission before a fourth gyroscope failed. Four new gyros were installed during the first servicing mission (STS-61) in December 1993 and all six gyros were working during the second servicing mission (STS-82) in February 1997. Since then, a gyro failed in 1997, another in 1998 and a third in 1999. The Hubble team believed they understood the cause of the failures, although they could not be certain until the gyros were returned from space. Having fewer than three working gyroscopes would have precluded science observations, although the telescope would have remained safely in orbit until a servicing crew arrived.

Hubble&#x27;s gyros spin at a constant rate of 19,200 rpm on gas bearings. This wheel is mounted in a sealed cylinder, which floats in a thick fluid. Electricity is carried to the motor by thin wires (approximately the size of a human hair). It is believed that oxygen in the pressurized air used during the assembly process caused the wires to corrode and break. The new gyros were assembled using nitrogen instead of oxygen. Each gyroscope is packaged in a Rate Sensor assembly. The Rate Sensors are packaged in pairs into an assembly called a Rate Sensor Unit (RSU). It is the RSUs that the STS-103&#x27;s astronauts changed. The RSUs each weigh and are 12.8 by 10.5 by 8.9 inches (325 by 267 by 226 mm) in size.

In addition to replacing all six gyroscopes on the December flight, the crew replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) and the spacecraft&#x27;s computer. The new computer reduced the burden of flight software maintenance and significantly lowered costs. The new computer was 20 times faster and had six times the memory of the DF-224 computer previously used on Hubble. It weighs and is 18.8 by 18 by 13 inches (478 by 457 by 330 mm) in size. The FGS installed was a refurbished unit that was returned from Servicing Mission 2. It weighs and is 5.5 by 4 by 2 feet (1.68 by 1.22 by 0.61 m) in size.

A voltage/temperature improvement kit (VIK) was also installed to protect spacecraft batteries from overcharging and overheating when the spacecraft goes into safe mode. The VIK modifies the charge cutoff voltage to a lower level to prevent battery overcharging and associated overheating. The VIK weighs about .

The repair mission also installed a new S-Band Single Access Transmitter (SSAT). Hubble has two identical SSATs onboard and can operate with only one. The SSATs send data from Hubble through NASA&#x27;s Tracking Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) to the ground. The new transmitter replaced one that failed in 1998. The SSAT weighs and is 14 by 8 by inches (356 by 203 by 70 mm).

A spare solid state recorder was also installed to allow efficient handling of high-volume data. Prior to the second servicing mission, Hubble used three 1970s-style reel-to-reel tape recorders. During the second servicing mission, one of these mechanical recorders was replaced with a digital solid state recorder. During this mission a second mechanical recorder was replaced by a second solid state recorder. The new recorder could hold approximately 10 times as much data as the old unit (12 gigabytes instead of 1.2 gigabytes). The recorder weighs and is 12 by 9 by 7 inches in size.

Finally, the EVA crew replaced the telescope&#x27;s outer insulation that had degraded. The insulation is necessary to control the internal temperature on the Hubble. The New Outer Blanket Layer (NOBL) and Shell/Shield Replacement Fabric (SSRF) help protect Hubble from the harsh environment of space. It protects the telescope from the severe and rapid temperature changes it experiences during each 90 minute orbit as it moves from sunlight to darkness.

STS-103 also carried hundreds of thousands of student signatures as part of the Student Signatures in Space (S3) program. The unique project provided elementary schools (selected on a rotating basis) with special posters to be autographed by students, then scanned onto disks and carried aboard a NASA Space Shuttle mission.

It was the &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; last solo spaceflight. All later missions by Discovery were International Space Station missions.

Astronaut John Grunsfeld, who was one of the mission specialists on this mission, brought a &quot;Planet Mars Flag&quot; aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;.

<text>STS-99 was a Space Shuttle mission using &quot;Endeavour&quot;, that launched on 11 February 2000 from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The primary objective of the mission was the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) project. This was also the last solo flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;; all future flights for &quot;Endeavour&quot; became devoted to the International Space Station. STS-99 was also the first Shuttle mission of the 2000s.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==
The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was an international project spearheaded by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (now the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense, and NASA, with participation of the German Aerospace Center DLR. Its objective was to obtain the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of the Earth. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew onboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; during its 11-day mission. This radar system gathered around 8 terabytes of data to produce high-quality 3-D images of the Earth&#x27;s surface.

SRTM used C-band and X-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) to acquire topographic data of Earth&#x27;s land mass (between 60°N and 56°S). It produced digital topographic map products which met Interferometric Terrain Height Data (ITHD)-2 specifications (30 meter x 30 meter spatial sampling with 16 meter absolute vertical height accuracy, 10 meter relative vertical height accuracy and 20 meter absolute horizontal circular accuracy). The result of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was close to 1 trillion measurements of the Earth&#x27;s topography. Besides contributing to the production of better maps, these measurements could lead to improved water drainage modeling, more realistic flight simulators, better locations for cell phone towers, and enhanced navigation safety.

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission mast was deployed successfully to its full length, and the antenna was turned to its operation position. After a successful checkout of the radar systems, mapping began at 00:31 EST, less than 12 hours after launch. Crewmembers split into two shifts so they could work around the clock, and began mapping an area from 60 degrees north to 56 degrees south. Data was sent to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for analysis, and early indications showed the data to be of excellent quality.

Mapping proceeded fairly smoothly, but during an attitude-hold period for payload mapping during the second day of flight, it was determined that orbiter propellant usage had doubled from 0.07 to 0.15% an hour. The increase was caused by a failure of the payload cold-gas thrust system that was used to offset the gravity gradient torque of the mast. As a result of this failure, orbiter propellant was being used at a higher-than-planned rate to maintain the attitude of the vehicle. Measures to reduce the expenditure were evaluated and based on the analysis, enough propellant could be saved to complete the planned 9-day plus science mission.

The first of a series of &quot;flycast&quot; maneuvers during the mission was also made on the second day of flight. The flycast maneuver was designed to reduce strain on the almost mast extending from &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s payload bay when adjustments to &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s orbit were needed.

The orbiter, which flew tail-first during mapping operations, was moved to a nose-first attitude with the mast extending upward. A brief reaction control system pulse began the maneuver. This caused the mast to deflect slightly backwards then rebound forward. As it reached vertical, a stronger thrust was applied, arresting the mast&#x27;s motion and increasing the orbiter&#x27;s speed.

Radar data gathering concluded at 06:54 EST on the tenth day of flight after a final sweep across Australia. During 222 hours and 23 minutes of mapping, &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s radar images filled 332 high density tapes and covered 99.98% of the planned mapping area – land between 60 degrees north latitude and 56 degrees south latitude – at least once and 94.6% of it twice. Only about in scattered areas remained unimaged, most of them in North America and most already well mapped by other methods. Enough data was gathered to fill the equivalent of 20,000 CDs.

Also aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; was a student experiment called EarthKAM, which took 2,715 digital photos during the mission through an overhead flight-deck window. The NASA-sponsored program allowed middle school students to select photo targets and receive the images via the Internet. The pictures were used in classroom projects on Earth science, geography, mathematics and space science. More than 75 middle schools around the world participated in the experiment, which set a record. On four previous flights combined, EarthKAM sent down a total of 2,018 images.

STS-99 also saw the recommissioning of the Spacelab pallet system, despite the Spacelab system being discontinued almost two years prior.

The 2007 Smithsonian Networks documentary Oasis Earth was made about the mission, containing HD video from inside &quot;Endeavour&quot;, including many views looking at the Earth below. One highlight of the documentary features Mamoru Mohri shooting video of the Moon and Mount Fuji.

This was the last mission to fly with the original Space Shuttle cockpit layout in 18 straight years. Although the next mission (STS-101) featured the &quot;glass cockpit&quot; on &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Endeavour&quot; and sister orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot; continued flying with the original cockpit layout until after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 10.
Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-101 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot; Atlantis&quot;. The mission was a 10-day mission conducted between 19 May 2000 and 29 May 2000. The mission was designated 2A.2a and was a resupply mission to the International Space Station. STS-101 was delayed 3 times in April due to high winds. STS-101 traveled 4.1 million miles and completed 155 revolutions of the earth and landed on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center. The mission was the first to be flown by a shuttle equipped with a glass cockpit.

==Mission highlights==

The flight was originally given the designation &quot;2A.2&quot;, serving as a logistics flight to carry cargo to the then-uncrewed space station, in between 2A.1/STS-96 and 3A/STS-92. STS-101 was originally planned to arrive after the Service Module Zvezda, but when Zvezda fell further behind, mission 2A.2 was split into 2A.2a and 2A.2b, the former arriving before Zvezda and the latter arriving after. The original plan for STS-101 was to have crewmembers perform a spacewalk to connect cables to Zvezda, but when the module slipped, so did the EVA, and the three spacewalk crewmembers Lu, Williams, and Malenchenko followed their EVA onto STS-106. Needing three additional crew for STS-101, the Expedition 2 crew of Voss, Helms, and Usachov joined the STS-101 crew for a short mission to their future home.

STS-101 delivered supplies to the International Space Station, hauled up using a Spacehab double module and an Integrated Cargo Carrier pallet. The crew performed a spacewalk and then reboosted the station from to .

Detailed objectives included ISS ingress/safety to take air samples, monitor carbon dioxide, deploy portable, personal fans, measure air flow, rework/modify ISS ducting, replace air filters, and replace Zarya fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. Critical replacements, repairs and spares were also done to replace four suspect batteries on Zarya, replace failed or suspect electronics for Zarya&#x27;s batteries, replace Radio Telemetry System memory unit, replace port early communications antenna, replace Radio Frequency Power Distribution Box and clear Space Vision System target.

The mission also included incremental assembly/upgrades such as assembly of Strela crane, installation of additional exterior handrails, set up of center-line camera cable, installation of &quot;Komparus&quot; cable inserts and reseating the U.S. crane. Assembly parts, tools and equipment were also transferred to the station and equipment stowed for future missions.

The station was also resupplied with water, a docking mechanism accessory kit, film and video tape for documentation, office supplies and personal items. Crew health maintenance items were also transferred including exercise equipment, medical support supplies, formaldehyde monitor kit and a passive dosimetry system.

This mission was almost similar to the &quot;Columbia disaster&quot;. A damaged tile seam caused a breach which allowed superheated gas to enter the left wing during reentry. The gas did not penetrate deeply and the damage was repaired before the next flight. If it had penetrated deeply the Shuttle could have been destroyed during reentry.

This mission was the first mission to fly with a glass cockpit.

==Mission highlights==

Space Station assembly flight ISS-2A.2b utilized the SPACEHAB Double Module and the Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC) to bring supplies to the station. The mission also included one spacewalk.

Veteran Astronaut Terrence Wilcutt (Col., USMC) led the seven-man crew, commanding his second Shuttle flight and making his fourth trip into space. During the planned 11-day mission, Wilcutt and his crew mates spent a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a double SPACEHAB cargo module in the rear of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s cargo bay and from a Russian Progress M-1 resupply craft docked to the aft end of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module. &quot;Zvezda&quot;, which linked up to the ISS on 26 July, served as the early living quarters for the station and is the cornerstone of the Russian contribution to the ISS.

Mission STS-106 was added to the manifest after delays in launching &quot;Zvezda&quot;. The STS-101 flight was originally planned to carry cargo to the ISS and have three crew perform an EVA to connect &quot;Zvezda&quot; to the ISS, but the delays caused the mission objectives of STS-101 to be split into 2A.2a (STS-101) and 2A.2b (STS-106). The three spacewalk crewmembers Lu, Williams, and Malenchenko followed their EVA onto STS-106.

The goal of the flight was to prepare &quot;Zvezda&quot; for the arrival of the first residents, or Expedition, crew later in the fall of 2000 and the start of a permanent human presence on the new outpost. That crew, made up of Expedition Commander Bill Shepherd, Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev, launched on 31 October 2000 in a Soyuz capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for a four-month &quot;shakedown&quot; mission aboard the ISS.

On flight day three, Dr. Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko (Col., Russian Air Force), who were both making their second flights into space, conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk. The spacewalk&#x27;s objective focused on routing and connecting nine power, data and communications cables between the Zvezda module and the other Russian-built module, Zarya, as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer. The magnetometer would serve as a three-dimensional compass designed to minimize Zvezda propellant usage by relaying information to the module&#x27;s computers regarding its orientation relative to the Earth.

Lu and Malenchenko used tethers and handrails along the ISS to make their way to a point more than above the cargo bay, the farthest any tethered spacewalker has ventured outside the shuttle. They completed this with the assistance of their crewmates Burbank and Mastracchio who deftly maneuvered them around with the robotic arm. This spacewalk celebrates the sixth spacewalk in support of the station assembly and the 50th spacewalk in Space Shuttle history. Also this was the second joint U.S.-Russian space walk outside a Space Shuttle, following on the work conducted by Astronaut Scott Parazynski and Cosmonaut Vladimir Titov outside &quot;Atlantis&quot; while docked to the Mir Space Station during the STS-86 mission in October 1997. Lu, designated EV 1, wore the space suit marked by red stripes, while Malenchenko, EV 2, wore the pure white suit. This was Lu&#x27;s first space walk, while Malenchenko had conducted a pair of space walks totaling 12 hours during his four-month stay aboard Mir in 1994. Dan Burbank (Lt. Cmdr, USCG), who was a spaceflight rookie, served as the space walk choreographer.

Mission Specialist Rick Mastracchio, also a spaceflight novice, was the prime robot arm operator for the mission, using the Canadian-built arm to move Lu and Malenchenko around the ISS as they conducted their assembly work. Mastracchio is backed up on arm operations by Pilot Scott Altman (Cmdr., USN), making his second flight into space.

The final member of the crew was Russian Cosmonaut Dr. Boris Morukov, making his first flight into space. Morukov was responsible for unloading supplies from the Progress vehicle during the docked phase of the flight.

On flight day four the crew entered the International Space Station through Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2) to begin the transfer operations of more than three tons of hardware and supplies. &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; crew was the first to see the interior of the Russian Zvezda service module since it was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in July. Additionally, a reboost was performed using the orbiter&#x27;s Reaction Control System (RCS) to place the station in a higher orbit.

Transfer of supplies and maintenance tasks continued well into the fifth day, while orbiter consumables remained above the required levels allowing managers to extend the mission one additional day.

Activities on flight day five included the installation of three batteries inside &quot;Zvezda&quot;. In order to reduce the weight for launch, Zvezda was launched with only five of its eight batteries in place.

Lu and Malenchenko spent much of flight day seven installing voltage and current stabilizers in &quot;Zvezda&quot;. Components of the Elektron system, equipment sent into orbit to separate water into oxygen and hydrogen, were installed and would be activated after the first crew arrives.

The crew transferred more than 6,000 pounds of material – including six 100-pound bags of water, all of the food for the first resident crew, office supplies, onboard environmental supplies, a vacuum cleaner and a computer and monitor – to the interior of the station.

The astronauts spent a total of 5 days, 9 hours and 21 minutes inside the station before closing the hatch on the orbiting outpost. Wilcutt and Altman commanded a series of four altitude boosts to place the station in an orbit of approximately 241 by 233 statute miles, raising the average altitude by . After spending 7 days, 21 hours and 54 minutes linked to the station, &quot;Atlantis&quot; undocked at 11:46 pm EDT as Wilcutt and Altman fired &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; jets to move to a distance of about 450 feet for a double-loop flyaround.

Commander Terry Wilcutt guided &quot;Atlantis&quot; to a landing at 2:56 am Central time, wrapping up a 4.9 million mile mission in which more than three tons of equipment were delivered to the international outpost. Wilcutt and his crewmates, Pilot Scott Altman and Mission Specialists Ed Lu, Rick Mastracchio, Dan Burbank, Yuri Malenchenko and Boris Morukov completed the 23rd consecutive landing of a shuttle at the Florida spaceport, and the 30th landing of a Shuttle at the Cape in the last 31 flights.

The first initial amateur radio station was flown on board the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-106. The crew transferred the ham radio gear into the space station for future use by the Expedition One crew.

==Mission highlights==

STS-92 was an ISS assembly flight that brought the Z1 truss, Control Moment Gyros, Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) (mounted on a Spacelab pallet) and two DDCU (Heat pipes) to the space station.
The Z1 truss was the first exterior framework installed on the ISS and allowed the first U.S. solar arrays to be temporarily installed on &quot;Unity&quot; for early power during flight 4A. The Ku-band communication system supported early science capabilities and U.S. television on flight 6A. The CMGs (Control Moment Gyros) weigh about and provide non-propulsive (electrically powered) attitude control when activated on flight 5A, and PMA-3 provides shuttle docking port for solar array installation on flight 4A and Destiny Lab installation on flight 5A.

The mission included seven days of docked operations with the space station, four EVAs, and two ingress opportunities.

Over the course of four scheduled spacewalks, two teams of space walkers and an experienced robot arm operator collaborated to install the Z1 (Z for zenith port) truss structure on top of the U.S. Unity connecting node on the growing station and to deliver the third Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA 3) to the ISS for the future berthing of new station components and to accommodate shuttle dockings.

The Z1 truss was the first permanent lattice-work structure for the ISS, very much like a girder, setting the stage for the future addition of the station&#x27;s major trusses or backbones. The Z1 fixture also served as the platform on which the huge U.S. solar arrays were mounted on the next shuttle assembly flight, STS-97. The Z1 truss included many elements of the Communications and Tracking subsystem. The hardware included a Transmitter/Receiver/Controller (SGTRC) built by L3 Communications Systems-East in Camden, NJ. John Schina was the Chief Engineer of the ISS Program at L3.

The Z1 contains four large gyroscopic devices, called Control Moment Gyroscope (CMGs), which are used to maneuver the space station into the proper orientation on orbit once they were activated following the installation of the U.S. laboratory.

During the fourth spacewalk, astronauts Wisoff and López-Alegría tested the SAFER jet backpack, flying up to 50 feet while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.

<doc id="557240" wikidata="Q64294" url="?curid=557240" title="Ferdinand von Hochstetter">
<text>Christian Gottlieb Ferdinand Ritter von Hochstetter (30 April 1829 – 18 July 1884) was a German-Austrian geologist. In 1857 he was appointed geologist on the Austrian Novara expedition to New Zealand, collecting natural history specimens and producing the first geological map of New Zealand.

== Career ==
Von Hochstetter was born in Esslingen, then in the kingdom of Württemberg, to Christian Ferdinand and his second wife, Sophie Orth. His father was a parson who also published on botanical and geological subjects. Having received his early education at the evangelical seminary at Maulbronn, Ferdinand proceeded to the University of Tübingen and the Tübinger Stift; there, under Friedrich August von Quenstedt, the interest he already felt in geology became permanently fixed, and he obtained his doctor&#x27;s degree and a travelling scholarship.

He then travelled to Vienna where in 1853, he joined the staff of the Imperial Geological Survey of Austria and was engaged until 1856 in parts of Bohemia, especially in the Bohemian Forest, and in the Fichtel Hills and Karlsbad mountains. His excellent reports established his reputation. Thus he came to be chosen as geologist to the Novara expedition (1857–59), and made numerous valuable observations in the voyage round the world.

The Novara arrived in New Zealand on 22 December 1858. Almost immediately he met the German scientist Julius von Haast who had also recently arrived in New Zealand, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. Polymath Arthur Purchas convinced von Hochstetter to stay in New Zealand, where he spent the next nine months of his life. In 1859, Ferdinand was employed by the government of New Zealand to make a first geological survey of the islands. His survey of old Lake Rotomahana and the Pink and White Terraces provides the only primary evidence of the Terrace locations today. Between 2016 and 2020, his survey diary was reverse engineered to provide coordinates of the Pink, Black and White Terraces. On his return he was appointed in 1860 professor of mineralogy and geology at the Imperial-Royal Polytechnic Institute in Vienna; from 1874 to 1875, he was the rector there.

His analysis of the tsunami generated by the 1868 Arica (Peru) earthquake is well known for its contribution to understanding of tsunami propagation. The resulting tsunami caused damaging surges in a number of regions in the Pacific region, including fatalities on the Chatham Islands. Von Hochstetter, charted the trajectory of the event throughout the Pacific. This also enabled an estimate of the depth of the Pacific Ocean to be calculated.

In 1872, he became the natural history tutor of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria. In 1876, he was made superintendent of the Imperial Natural History Museum. In these later years he explored portions of Turkey and eastern Russia, and he published papers on a variety of geological, palaeontological and mineralogical subjects.

In 1869, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society and in 1884, was granted a hereditary knighthood by the Emperor of Austria.

Detailed descriptions in his diaries were helpful in 2011, when researchers managed to locate the silica terraces on Lake Rotomahana, which was buried in the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.

==Personal life==
He was born at Esslingen, Württemberg, the son of Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter (1787–1860) and his second wife, Sophie Orth. Christian Ferdinand was a clergyman and Professor at Bonn, who was also a botanist and mineralogist. In 1861 von Hochstetter married Georgiana Bengough, daughter of John Egbert Bengough, an Englishman who was director of the Vienna city gasworks. They went on to have eight children. A good deal is known of his personal life through his documented correspondence with friend and colleague Julius von Haast He died in Oberdöbling near Vienna, at age 55 from complications of diabetes.

==Legacy==
The Geoscience Society of New Zealand holds an annual lecture named in von Hochstetter&#x27;s honour.

===Taxonomy===
New Zealand&#x27;s endemic Hochstetter&#x27;s frog, &quot;Leiopelma hochstetteri&quot;, is named after Ferdinand. Several other species bear his name in their scientific names, including the Takahē, &quot;Porphyrio hochstetteri&quot;, and &quot;Powelliphanta hochstetteri&quot;, a species (with five subspecies) of New Zealand&#x27;s giant carnivorous land snails.

===Geography===
Hochstetter Peak on Trinity Peninsula in Antarctica is named after Hochstetter, as are New Zealand&#x27;s Mount Hochstetter (West Coast Region), Lake Hochstetter and the Hochstetter Dome and Hochstetter Icefall close to the Tasman Glacier.

===Geology===
The rock type dunite was named by Ferdinand von Hochstetter in 1859, after Dun Mountain near Nelson, New Zealand.

==Mission highlights==

During the 11-day mission, the primary objective was completed, which was to deliver and connect the first set of U.S.-provided solar arrays and the P6 Truss to the International Space Station. The astronauts completed three spacewalks, during which they prepared a docking port for arrival of the Destiny Laboratory Module, installed Floating Potential Probes to measure electrical potential surrounding the station, installed a camera cable outside the Unity Module, and transferred supplies, equipment and refuse between &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the station.

On Flight Day 3, Commander Brent Jett linked &quot;Endeavour&quot; to the ISS while above northeast Kazakhstan.

The successful checkout of the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs), the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) units, the Canadarm (RMS), the Orbiter Space Vision System (OSVS) and the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) were all completed nominally. Also, the ODS centerline camera was installed with no misalignment noted.

From inside &quot;Endeavour&quot;, Canadian Mission Specialist Marc Garneau used the Canadarm to remove the 8 ton stainless steel P6 truss from the payload bay, maneuvering it into an overnight park position to warm its components. Mission Specialists Joseph Tanner and Carlos Noriega moved through &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s docking tunnel and opened the hatch to the ISS docking port to leave supplies and computer hardware on the doorstep of the Station. On flight day 4, the Expedition 1 Commander William Shepherd, Pilot Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev – entered the Unity Module for the first time and retrieved the items left for them.

At 09:36 EST on 8 December 2000, the crew paid the first visit to the Expedition 1 crew residing in the space station. Until then the shuttle and the station had kept one hatch closed to maintain respective atmospheric pressures, allowing the shuttle crew to conduct their spacewalks and mission goals. After a welcome ceremony and briefing, the eight spacefarers conducted structural tests of the station and its solar arrays, transferred equipment, supplies and refuse back and forth between the spacecraft, and checked out the television camera cable installed by Tanner and Noriega for the upcoming mission.

On 9 December 2000, the two crews completed final transfers of supplies to the station and other items being returned to Earth. The &quot;Endeavour&quot; crew bade farewell to the Expedition 1 crew at 10:51 EST and closed the hatches between the spacecraft. After being docked together for 6 days, 23 hours and 13 minutes, &quot;Endeavour&quot; undocked from the station at 14:13 EST. Piloted by Michael Bloomfield, it then made an hour-long, tail-first circle of the station. The undocking took place 235 statute miles above the border of Kazakhstan and China. The final separation burn took place near the northeast coast of South America.

STS-97 was the 15th flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the 101st Space Shuttle mission.

<text>STS-98 was a 2001 Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot; Atlantis&quot;. It was the first human spaceflight launch of the 21st century. STS-98 delivered to the station the &quot;Destiny&quot; Laboratory Module. All mission objectives were completed and the shuttle reentered and landed safely at Edwards Air Force Base on 20 February 2001, after twelve days in space, six of which were spent docked to the ISS.

==Mission highlights==

The crew continued the task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering the U.S. &quot;Destiny&quot; Laboratory Module. It was the first NASA lab to be permanently used since the days of Skylab nearly three decades earlier. It was manufactured by Boeing at the Michoud Assembly Facility and the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1997. Upon transport to Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s industrial buildings, it was fitted with equipment, machines, racks and cables at the Operations and Checkout Building and Space Station Processing Facility. The U.S. laboratory module is long and wide. It is made from aluminum, and comprises three cylindrical sections and two end-cones that contain the hatch openings through which astronauts enter and exit the module. The ends are colored blue and white respectively for the crew to navigate easily. A -diameter window is located on one side of the center module segment.

During the mission, the shuttle docked to PMA 3 located on the nadir of Node 1. The crew relocated PMA 2 to the holding area on the Z1 truss temporarily, before using the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm to lift out the 14.5 ton steel module out of the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay, and permanently berthed it on the forward hatch of Node 1. Spacewalks conducted by Thomas Jones and Robert Curbeam reattached electrical cables to the aluminum hull and connecting ports on &quot;Destiny&quot;, and also checked the laboratory&#x27;s nadir window. PMA 2 was replaced to the forward hatch of Destiny.

The Shuttle spent six days docked to the station while the laboratory was attached and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The mission also saw the 100th spacewalk in U.S. spaceflight history. STS-98 occurred while the first station crew was aboard the new space station.

<text>STS-102 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot; Discovery&quot; and launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-102 flew in March 2001; its primary objectives were resupplying the ISS and rotating the Expedition 1 and Expedition 2 crews. It was Discovery&#x27;s 29th flight. The first EVA performed on the mission, at eight hours and 56 minutes, held the title of the longest spacewalk ever undertaken until the 17th of December 2024 when it was surpassed by Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong during the Shenzhou 19 spaceflight.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
Unique to this flight, Shepherd, Gidzenko, and Krikalev were all seated together on the mid-deck in special &quot;recumbent couches&quot; that allowed them to stay in a laid-back reclining position during landing, instead of the usual upright seats. It was thought that after their four months in space, their bodies would be deconditioned and the recumbent position would minimize the impacts of returning to a gravity environment. Because of the special seats, Thomas moved to the normal number 5 seat on the mid-deck to operate the side hatch as necessary. Future shuttle missions would not use the recumbent couches.

<text>STS-100 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot; Endeavour&quot;. STS-100 launch on 19 April 2001, and installed the ISS Canadarm2 robotic arm.

== Crew ==
== Mission highlights ==

The highest priority objectives of the flight were the installation, activation and checkout of the Canadarm2 robotic arm on the station. The arm - manufactured by MDA Space Missions under contract of the Canadian Space Agency and NASA, went into operation on 28 April 2001. It was critical to the capability to continue assembly of the International Space Station. The arm was also necessary to attach a new airlock to the station on the subsequent shuttle flight, mission STS-104. The final component of the Canadarm is the Mobile Base System (MBS), which was installed on board the station during the STS-111 flight.

Other major objectives for &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s mission were to berth the &quot;Raffaello&quot; logistics module to the station, activate it, transfer cargo between &quot;Raffaello&quot; and the station, and reberth &quot;Raffaello&quot; in the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay. &quot;Raffaello&quot; is the second of three Italian Space Agency-developed Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, manufactured out of stainless steel at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center; that were launched to the station. The &quot;Leonardo&quot; module was launched and returned on the previous shuttle flight, STS-102, in March.

Remaining objectives included the transfer of other equipment to the station such as an Ultra-High Frequency communications antenna and a spare electronics component to be attached to the exterior during space walks. Finally, the transfer of supplies and water for use aboard the station, the transfer of experiments and experiment racks to the complex, and the transfer of items for return to Earth from the station to the shuttle were among the objectives.

Endeavour also boosted the station&#x27;s altitude and performed a flyaround survey of the complex, including recording views of the station with an IMAX cargo bay camera.

All objectives were completed without incident, and reentry and landing happened uneventfully on 1 May 2001.

During this mission, astronaut Chris Hadfield made the first spacewalk by a Canadian.

<text>Iran Khodro (, &quot;Irân Xodro&quot;), branded as IKCO, is an Iranian automaker headquartered in Tehran. IKCO was founded in 1962 as Iran National (, &quot;Irân Nâsionâl&quot;). The public company manufactures vehicles, including Samand, Peugeot and Renault cars, and trucks, minibuses and buses. As of 2009, it produced 688,000 passenger cars per year.

==History and development==

===Name===
The word &quot;khodro&quot; () means &quot;automobile&quot; in Persian, hence Iran Khodro means &quot;Iran Automobile&quot;.

===Founding===
Iran Khodro was founded on August 29, 1962.

===Structure===
Iran Khodro Industrial Group (IKCO) is a public joint stock company with the objective of creation and management of factories to manufacture various types of vehicles and parts as well as selling and exporting them.

===Size and production===
The company has become the largest vehicle manufacturer in the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa. In Iran, it is the largest vehicle manufacturing company, having an average share of 65 percent of domestic vehicle production.

Iran Khodro produced 556,442 passenger cars and commercial vehicles in 2023 and has planned to produce 600,000 units in 2024.
===Certifications===
Iran Khodro has qualified for ISO 9001 from RW-TUV, Germany, as well as many other health, safety, and environment certificates including ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.

===Products and relationships===
Iran&#x27;s automobile production crossed the 1 million mark in 2005. Iran Khodro is one of the largest car manufacturers in Asia. It has established joint-ventures with foreign partners on 4 continents.
For more than three decades, Iran Khodro produced the Paykan, a car developed from the Rootes Group&#x27;s Rootes Arrow range, best known as the Hillman Hunter. Paykan saloon car production was discontinued in 2005, almost thirty years after the end of Arrow production (latterly as the Chrysler Hunter) in Britain. A pick-up version was still in production until 2015. Bardo Pick-up, pick-up version of Paykan, will be replaced by a new pick-up called the Arisun which is related to the Samand .

Iranian-designed IKCO Samand, replaces the dated Paykan as Iran&#x27;s &quot;national car&quot;, and features a part-Iranian designed CNG/petrol dual-fuel engine in its Soren variant.

The firm has a long-term relationship with European and Asian manufacturers including PSA Peugeot Citroën, manufacturing and assembling a number of models under license from these firms. In 2009, Peugeot 206, Peugeot Pars, Peugeot 405, Peugeot Roa, and Samand sedans were IKCO&#x27;s export-bound cars sent to Azerbaijan, Iraq, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Syria and Afghanistan. As at 2012, IKCO products incorporate 5-10 percent of components imported from France. IKCO&#x27;s parts imports from Peugeot accounted for 700-800 million euros ($572–654 million) per year. Iran has reached 98% of self-sufficiency in producing Peugeot 405 parts and 75% in Peugeot 206 parts. 

By ending year 2012, Peugeot cuts its relations with Iran Khodro due to international sanctions against Iran. Four years later, in 2016, after reaching Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran and E3+3, Iran Khodro and Peugeot decided to make 50%-50% joint venture named IKAP to start the relations again.

Renault Pars is in charge of the engineering, quality control, parts supply, logistics, managing sales policies as well as marketing and customer services for Renault products in Iran and IKCO is one of its main shareholders that produces Tondar for the domestic market. Renault Pars is a joint venture, 51 percent of which belongs to Renault of France. Forty-nine percent of Renault Pars&#x27; shares is jointly held by Iran&#x27;s Industrial Development and Renovation Organization, IKCO and Saipa. The agreement to form this joint venture was signed in March 2004.

IKCO also manufactures trucks, buses and E-Class passenger cars under license from Mercedes-Benz. In a joint-venture with Daimler AG, Iran Khodro is to start production of sophisticated 900-class Mercedes-Benz engines; Daimler states that Iranian-made engines will be exported to Germany. Among Asian automotive manufacturers, IKCO is cooperating with Suzuki. Producing Suzuki Grand Vitara in IKCO&#x27;s Site in Khorasan, IKCO will produce Suzuki Kizashi.

In 2012, IKCO announced that at least 3% of the company&#x27;s sales will be allocated to research and development. As of 2015, the company&#x27;s 7-year strategic plans for product development are in body design, die making, suspension, powertrain, trim and car electronics.

In 2017, Italian car design firm &#x27;Pininfarina&#x27; signed a €70 million, 36-month contract with Iran&#x27;s biggest car producer, Iran Khodro Group on for the development of four new models and to give the carmaker a second wind in research and development of new models. The agreement will help develop a modular automotive platform for four different vehicles, and the first passenger car of the medium segment of the market, a press release from the Italian firm said.

===Production sites===

IKCO has 12 production site around the globe, 6 sites in within Iran&#x27;s borders and 6 further sites in IKCO&#x27;s main export markets.

Foreign sites:
==Export markets==
Russia, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Egypt, Algeria and Bulgaria are among the most important target markets for the group. 

Export opportunities are restricted to relatively low volumes with $60 million worth of cars exported in 2007. By this Iran Khodro has ranked as 24th company among 100 top companies in Islamic world in year 2008. The Company has exported about 35,000 cars in year 2009. The company exported 40,000 units in 2010, including 30% of the total production of its Samand model. IKCO intends to export 9% of its output in 2011, amounting to 75,000 vehicles, before reaching 16% in exports by 2014.

<text>STS-104 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Its primary objectives were to install the &quot;Quest&quot; Joint Airlock and help perform maintenance on the International Space Station. It launched on 12 July 2001 at 09:04 UTC, and returned to Earth without incident after successful docking, equipment installation, and three spacewalks.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==

The primary purpose of the flight was to deliver and install the &quot;Quest&quot; airlock. The Joint Airlock is a pressurized flight element consisting of two cylindrical chambers attached end-to-end by a connecting bulkhead and hatch. Once installed and activated, the ISS airlock became the primary path for International Space Station space walk entry and departure for U.S. spacesuits, which are known as Extravehicular Mobility Units, or EMUs. In addition, the Joint Airlock is designed to support the Russian Orlan spacesuit for EVA activity.

The Joint Airlock is 20 ft (6.1 m) long, 13 ft (4.0 m) in diameter and weighs 6.5 short tons (5.9 metric tons). It is made from steel and aluminum, and manufactured at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) by the Space Station main contractor Boeing. The ISS-airlock has two main components: a crew airlock and an equipment airlock for storing EVA gear and EVA preflight preps. STS-104 also carries a spacelab pallet with four High Pressure Gas Assembly containers that were attached to the exterior of the airlock.

Mission Specialists Michael Gernhardt and James Reilly conducted three space walks while Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; was docked to the International Space Station. They spent a total of 16 hours and 30 minutes outside. During the first space walk, Gernhardt and Reilly assisted in the installation of the airlock. During the second and third excursions, they focused on the external outfitting of the &quot;Quest&quot; airlock with four High Pressure Gas Tanks, handrails and other vital equipment. The third spacewalk was conducted from &quot;Quest&quot; itself.

STS-104 was the final Space Shuttle mission to have a five-member crew. All succeeding missions would have six or seven (except the final mission STS-135, which had 4).

=== First flight of Block II SSME ===
STS-104 was the first shuttle mission to fly with a &quot;Block II&quot; SSME. Post-launch analysis indicated an anomaly occurred when the engine was shut down. The cause was determined and the mitigation approach was demonstrated on the STS-108 flight in November 2001.

<text>STS-105 was the 30th mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, in which Discovery went to the International Space Station. It launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 10 August 2001. This mission was &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s final mission until STS-114, because &quot;Discovery&quot; was grounded for a refit, and then all Shuttles were grounded in the wake of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. The refit included an update of the flight deck to the glass cockpit layout, which was already installed on &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot;.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==

The main purpose of STS-105 was the rotation of the International Space Station crew and the delivery of supplies utilizing the Italian-built Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo on its second flight (STS-102, STS-105). The crew also performed two spacewalks and conducted scientific experiments. The Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) taken on STS-105 contained additional scientific racks, equipment and supplies. It is long and in diameter and has a dry mass of over . An identical module named Raffaello has flown twice (STS-100 and, later, STS-108).

Aboard Leonardo were six Resupply Stowage Racks, four Resupply Stowage Platforms, and two new scientific experiment racks for the station&#x27;s U.S. laboratory Destiny. The two new science racks (EXPRESS Racks 4 and 5) added further science capability to the station. EXPRESS stands for Expedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station. EXPRESS Rack 4 weighs and EXPRESS Rack 5 weighs . The empty weight of each EXPRESS rack is about . EXPRESS Racks 1 and 2A were delivered aboard the Raffaello cargo module during STS-100/6A in April 2001. EXPRESS Rack 3 was brought to the station during STS-111 in 2002. The racks were manufactured at the Space Station Processing Facility.

The Resupply Stowage Racks and Resupply Stowage Platforms were filled with Cargo Transfer Bags that contain equipment and supplies for the station. The six Resupply Stowage Racks contained almost of cargo and the four Resupply Stowage Platforms contained about of cargo, not including the weight of the Cargo Transfer Bags, the foam packing around the cargo or the straps and fences that held the bags in place. The total weight of cargo, racks and packing material aboard Leonardo was just over . Total cargo weight was about .

Also carried in the payload bay was an Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC) carrying the Early Ammonia Servicer and MISSE PECs 1 &amp; 2.

Another payload on board is the Materials International Space Station Experiments (MISSE). This project was a NASA/Langley Research Center-managed cooperative endeavor to fly materials and other types of space exposure experiments on the space station. The objective was to develop early, low-cost, non-intrusive opportunities to conduct critical space exposure tests of space materials and components planned for use on future spacecraft. Johnson Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Glenn Research Center, the Materials Laboratory at the Air Force Research Laboratory and Boeing Phantom Works were participants with Langley in the project. The MISSE experiments were the first externally mounted experiments conducted on the ISS. The experiments were in four Passive Experiment Containers (PECs) that were initially developed and used for an experiment on &quot;Mir&quot; in 1996 during the Shuttle-Mir Program. The PECs were transported to Mir on STS-76. After an 18-month exposure in space, they were retrieved on STS-86. PECs are suitcase-like containers for transporting experiments via the space shuttle to and from an orbiting spacecraft. Once on orbit and clamped to the host spacecraft, the PECs are opened and serve as racks to expose experiments to the space environment.

Other payloads on board were part of the Goddard Space Flight Center&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility Shuttle Small Payloads Project. The SSPP system utilizes payload carrier systems such as the Hitchhiker, Getaway Specials and Space Experiment Modules to provide a low cost scientific research environment. SSPP payloads on STS-105 include the Hitchhiker payload Simplesat, The Cell Growth in Microgravity GAS Canister (G-708), the Microgravity Smoldering Combustion experiment (MSC), and the Hitchhiker Experiment Advancing Technology Space Experiment Module-10 payload).

This was the only Shuttle launch to go before the scheduled launch time, at the beginning, rather than the optimal middle or later, of the 10-minute launch window to rendezvous with ISS. It launched early because an approaching storm system threatened to violate launch criteria at the appointed time.

<text>Friedrich August von Quenstedt (10 July 1809 – 21 December 1889) was a German geologist and palaeontologist.

==Life==
Von Quenstedt was born at Eisleben in Saxony, and educated at the Humboldt University of Berlin. After a period as assistant in the mineralogical museum, he was appointed associate professor (1837) and then professor (1841) of mineralogy and geognosy at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen.

==Work==
His earlier work related chiefly to crystallography and mineralogy, on which subjects he published text-books that were widely used. However, he also became distinguished for his researches on palaeontology, and especially for those on the fossils of the Jurassic system.

In 1845, he devised a trinomial system of nomenclature for Jurassic ammonites, which has caused some difficulty for later taxonomists. He investigated series of ammonite fossils which appeared to represent the coiled and uncoiled forms of similar shells, and considered that they arose as &#x27;pathological&#x27; forms. He also wrote several articles on pterosaurs.

Five genera were named in his honour: the bivalve mollusc genus &quot;Quenstedtia&quot; Morris &amp; Lycett 1854 and the (homonymous) coelenterate genus &quot;Quenstedtia&quot; Rominger 1876, coelenterate genus &quot;Quenstedtiphyllia&quot; Melnikova 1975, ammonite genus &quot;Quenstedtoceras Hyatt&quot;, 1876, and crinoid genus &quot;Quenstedticrinus&quot; Klikushin 1987. Also the specific epithet of &quot;Proganochelys quenstedti&quot; was named after him.

The mineral quenstedtite was named in his honour by G. Linck in 1888.

When Maria von Linden wrote her first paper on the mineral deposits in the River Hürbe it was read at Karlsruhe&#x27;s geological society (by a man) in 1890. The paper was noticed by Quenstedt who supported her ambitions. Linden went on to be the first woman in Germany to be called a professor.

==Chief publications==

His chief publications were:
*&quot;Method der Krystallographie&quot; (1840)
*&quot;Das Flözgebirge Wurttembergs&quot; (1843)
*&quot;Petrefactenkunde Deutschlands&quot; (7 vols. and atlases, 1846–84)
*&quot;Die Cephalopoden&quot; (1846–49)
*&quot;Handbuch der Petrefactenkunde&quot; (2 vols., 1852, 2nd ed. 1867, 3rd ed. 1882-85)
*&quot;Der Jura&quot; (2 vols, 1858)
*&quot;Handbuch der Mineralogie&quot; (1855, 3rd ed. 1877)

<text>STS-108 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot; Endeavour&quot;. Its primary objective was to deliver supplies to and help maintain the ISS.

STS-108 was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station and the first since the installation of the Russian airlock called Pirs on the station. &quot;Endeavour&quot; delivered the Expedition 4 crew to the orbital outpost. The Expedition 3 crew returned to Earth on &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

While at the station, the crew conducted one spacewalk and attached the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module to the station so that about 2.7 metric tons (3 tons) of equipment and supplies could be unloaded. The crew later returned Raffaello to &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s payload bay for the trip home.

==Crew==
==Cargo==
SSAF-UF-1 carried the Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM-2) &#x27;Raffaello&#x27; (2nd flight) 4th MPLM flight overall. Also the Multiple Application Customized Hitchhiker (MACH-1) MPESS Hitchhiker experiment bridge: with CAPL-3, Starshine-2, SEM-11 &amp; 15, G-0761, Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector (PSRD) 
&amp; COLLIDE-2. As well as the Lightweight MPESS Carrier #2 (LMC) carrying: SEM-12, G-0785, G-0064 and G-0730.

==Launch highlights==

The launch of &quot;Endeavour&quot; on 29 November 2001 was rescheduled for 4 December 2001 to allow sufficient time for the Expedition Three crew on the space station to successfully complete a spacewalk to clear an obstruction on the latching mechanism on the Russian Progress supply vehicle.

The launch 4 December was postponed due to unsatisfactory weather conditions in the KSC area. Launch controllers counted down to the T−5-minute point and held until the remainder of the window expired. The scrub had to be called after Astronaut Office Chief Charles Precourt, flying the Shuttle Training Aircraft, detected precipitation in a cloud mass that moved into the Complex 39 area shortly before launch.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; lifted off 5 December 2001 at 17:19 EST on the final Space Shuttle mission of 2001 to deliver three tons of supplies and a fresh crew to the International Space Station, and return home a crew that spent four months in space.

In addition to a new station crew and supplies, &quot;Endeavour&quot; carried a host of scientific investigations, including experiments from space agencies, schools and universities across the United States, Europe and South America, as well as a small satellite that involved more than 25,000 students in 26 countries.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==

The hatches were opened between &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the ISS Destiny Laboratory at 22:42 UTC 7 December 2001, enabling the ten crew members to greet one another. The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the International Space Station 8 December as their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred to &quot;Endeavour&quot; for the return trip home. The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat-liners to the Soyuz return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; Pilot Mark Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin used the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm to lift the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station&#x27;s Unity node. The crews began unloading supplies the same day.

===EVA===
EVA: 4 hours, 12 minutes – On 10 December 2001, &quot;Endeavour&quot; astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani completed a four-hour, 12-minute spacewalk to install insulation on mechanisms that rotate the International Space Station&#x27;s main solar arrays. The two spacewalkers stopped at a stowage bin to retrieve a cover that had been removed from a station antenna during an earlier flight, and after its return to Earth, may be reused. Godwin and Tani also performed a &quot;getahead;&quot; task, positioning two switches on the station&#x27;s exterior to be installed on a future shuttle mission, STS-110. The spacewalk completed a record year with 18 spacewalks conducted: 12 originating from the shuttle and six from the station.

===Maintenance and re-supply===
Mission managers extended &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s flight to a duration of 12 days to allow Endeavour&#x27;s crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor in one of the air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module.

The astronauts and cosmonauts completed the transfer of more than 5,000 pounds of supplies and material from &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s mid-deck and the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module to the station. The transferred items included more than 850 pounds of food, 1,000 pounds of clothing and other crew provisions, 300 pounds of experiments and associated equipment, 800 pounds of spacewalking gear, and 600 pounds of medical equipment. In turn, the crew packed up the Raffaello module with items bound for a return trip to Earth.

===IMU failure===
On 12 December 2001, the crew and Mission Control noted a transient problem with one of the shuttle&#x27;s three inertial measurement units (IMUs), the primary navigation units for the shuttle. Only two of the three IMUs were on line at the time, with the third unit off line to save electricity. The IMU that experienced a problem, designated IMU 2, was immediately taken off line and the third IMU brought on line. IMU 2 operated well after that, but it remained off line and was considered failed by flight controllers. The loss of one IMU had no impact on &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s mission, and the other two units operated in excellent condition.

A formal change of command ceremony took place 13 December as Expedition 3 ended its residence and Expedition 4 began theirs.

===Reboost and departure===
Flight controllers planned slight changes to &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s departure from the station 15 December 2001, allowing time for a small jet firing by the shuttle to boost the station&#x27;s future path away from a piece of space debris that could pass near the complex. Mission Control was notified that a spent Russian rocket upper stage launched in the 1970s could pass within three miles of the station if &quot;Endeavour&quot; did not perform the engine firing. With the shuttle reboost, the station was predicted to pass more than 40 miles away from the debris.

Because the scheduled reboost used additional propellant, &quot;Endeavour&quot; did not perform a full-circle flyaround of the station after undocking. Instead, the shuttle undocked from the station, performing a quarter circle flyaround of the complex to a point about 400 feet directly above the station where it fired its engines in a final separation burn at 12:20 am EST, beginning its departure from the orbiting outpost.

===Scientific experiments===
&quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s middeck carried home the results of several experiments completed during Expedition 3&#x27;s stay on the station. These included the Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility, the Dynamically Controlled Protein Crystal Growth experiment and cells from the Cellular Biotechnology Operations Support System (CBOSS).

The CBOSS equipment aboard the space station will remain active during Expedition 4, growing ovarian and colon cancer cells, as well as kidney cells in microgravity.

Experiments in &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s payload bay were returned for investigators around the world. The Multiple Application Customized Hitchhiker-1 (MACH-1) carried a wide array of experiments, including the Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector, the Collisions into Dust Experiment-2, the Capillary Pump Loop, and the Space Experiment Module (SEM). The SEM carried experiments from Argentina, Portugal, Morocco and Australia, as well as experiments from U.S. schoolchildren. Several other canisters in &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s payload bay also carried student experiments.

On its return to Earth, &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s crew deployed a small satellite called STARSHINE 2 from a canister located in the payload bay. More than 30,000 students from 660 schools in 26 countries will be tracking STARSHINE 2 as it orbits the Earth for eight months. The students, who helped polish STARSHINE&#x27;s 845 mirrors, will use the information they collect to calculate the density of the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere.

==Honoring victims of the September 11 attacks==
STS-108 was the first Space Shuttle launch following the September 11 attacks, and remembering it would become a focus of the flight. Security was increased at Kennedy Space Center for press and visitors for the launch, and press activity was more tightly controlled.

In the early morning hours of 12 September 2001, New York City Police Sergeant Gerald Kane and Detective Peter Friscia, assigned to the office of Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, retrieved a large American flag that was tattered and torn and wrapped around a flag pole near in corners of Church and Chambers Street amidst the devastation of the World Trade Center site.
That American flag, a USMC flag recovered from the Pentagon, an American flag that flew over the State Capital in Harrisburg, PA on the day of 11 September, the 23 shields (badges) of the fallen NYPD officers; patches, posters and an emblem from the FDNY, patches from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and 6,000 small American flags to honor those lost and those that served in the response and recovery efforts for 9/11 were all flown aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

The 6,000 smaller flags were later given to families that lost loved ones on 9/11 and the flag retrieved from the World Trade Center site is maintained by the Office of the New York City Commissioner of Records.

<text>Formerly known as The United Kingdom Office for Library and Information Networking, UKOLN was a centre of expertise in digital information management, providing advice and services to the library, information, education and cultural heritage communities. UKOLN was based at the University of Bath and was funded through a mixture of core and project grants. Latterly it received its core funding solely from JISC, but had received core grants previously from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and the British Library.

==History==
UKOLN traces its roots back to 1977, when Maurice Line initiated the Bath University Programme of Catalogue Research with funding from the British Library. This led to the establishment, in 1979, of a research centre under the directorship of Philip Bryant, again with British Library funding. It was known initially as the Centre for Catalogue Research, and later renamed the Centre for Bibliographic Management (CBM) to reflect its broadening research portfolio.

In 1989, the British Library established the UK Office for Library Networking to work alongside the CBM. It had one full-time member of staff. In 1992, it merged with the CBM and started to receive additional core funding from JISC. The combined organisation was known briefly as UKOLN: The Office for Library and Information Networking, but three years later this was simplified to the UK Office for Library and Information Networking. In 2002 it became known simply as UKOLN, again reflecting a shift in the focus of its activity.

In 1994, Lorcan Dempsey succeeded Philip Bryant as Director of UKOLN. He in turn was succeeded in the role by Liz Lyon in 2000.

In May 2013 an article published in the Times Higher Education announced that &quot;16 of its 24 University of Bath-based staff [were made] redundant after the cessation of a £622,000 annual grant from the higher education technology body Jisc&quot;.

Although UKOLN continued after 31 July 2013 it was significantly reduced in size and was no longer working in many of the areas which were responsible for its visibility in national and international arenas. UKOLN&#x27;s Director departed without replacement in late 2013. The remaining staff were made redundant or redeployed in July 2015, marking the cessation of UKOLN&#x27;s activities.

==Work==
UKOLN&#x27;s main work included:
*influencing policy and informing practice;
*promoting community-building and consensus making by actively raising awareness;
*advancing knowledge through research and development;
*building innovative systems and services based on Web technologies;
*acting as an agent for knowledge transfer.

Its specialist areas included metadata, interoperability and digital curation. It was involved in a range of national and international projects including the DELOS Network of Excellence in Digital Libraries, the Development of a European Service for Information on Research and Education (DESIRE), the Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research (DRIVER, a precursor to OpenAIRE), the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, the Knowledge and Information Management (KIM) Grand Challenge Project, and the development of the SWORD interoperability standard and the Bath Profile of the Z39.50 standard. It was a founder member of the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in 2004.

UKOLN published the Ariadne (Web magazine), targeted principally at information science professionals in academia, archives, libraries and museums, and the &quot;International Journal of Digital Curation&quot;. UKOLN also organised many events, including the annual Institutional Web Management Workshop and the International Digital Curation Conference.

<text>STS-109 (SM3B) was a Space Shuttle mission that launched from the Kennedy Space Center on 1 March 2002. It was the 108th mission of the Space Shuttle program, the 27th flight of the orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; and the fourth servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope. It was also the last successful mission of the orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; before the ill-fated STS-107 mission, which culminated in the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was placed in orbit during mission STS-31 on 25 April 1990. Initially designed to operate for 15 years, plans for periodic service and refurbishment were incorporated into its mission from the start. After the successful completion of the second planned service mission (SM2) by the crew of STS-82 in February 1997, three of the telescope&#x27;s six gyroscopes failed. NASA decided to split the third planned service mission into two parts, SM3A and SM3B. A fifth and final servicing mission, STS-125 (SM4) launched on 11 May 2009. The work performed during SM4 kept HST in operation through 2024.

==Mission highlights==

The purpose of STS-109 was to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It was &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; first flight following an extensive two and a half year modification period (its most recent mission being STS-93). During the mission the crew installed a new science instrument, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), new rigid solar arrays (SA3), a new Power Control Unit (PCU) and an experimental cryocooler for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). &quot;Columbia&quot; also reboosted HST to a higher orbit.
The STS-109 astronauts performed a total of five spacewalks in five consecutive days to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. The spacewalkers received assistance from their crewmates inside &quot;Columbia&quot;. Currie operated the Shuttle&#x27;s robot arm while Altman was her backup. Carey and Altman documented the EVAs with video and still images.

Accomplishments of the spacewalks included the installation of new solar arrays, a new camera, a new Power Control Unit, a Reaction Wheel Assembly and an experimental cooling system for the NICMOS unit. STS-109 accumulated a total of 35 hours, 55 minutes of EVA time. Following STS-109, a total of 18 spacewalks had been conducted during four Space Shuttle missions to service Hubble (the others being STS-61, STS-82, STS-103 and STS-125) for a total of 129 hours, 10 minutes by 14 different astronauts.
Columbia made its twenty-seventh and last successful landing at Kennedy Space Center, as on its next mission, STS-107, it disintegrated on re-entry, killing all aboard.

STS-109 is considered a night launch, as sunrise was at 6:47 am, and &quot;Columbia&quot; launched at 6:22 am EST, 25 minutes before sunrise.

<text>STS-110 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on 8–19 April 2002 flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The main purpose was to install the S0 Truss segment, which forms the backbone of the truss structure on the station.

== Crew ==

== Mission highlights ==

The main purpose of STS-110 was to attach the stainless steel S0 Truss segment to the International Space Station (ISS) to the Destiny Laboratory Module. It forms the backbone of the station to which the S1 and P1 truss segments were attached (on the following missions STS-112 and STS-113, respectively).

STS-110 also delivered the Mobile Transporter (MT), which is an (1,950 lb) assembly that glides down rails on the station integrated trusses. The MT was designed and manufactured by Astro Aerospace in Carpinteria, CA. During the next shuttle mission, STS-111, the Mobile Base System (MBS) was mounted to the MT. This Mobile Servicing System (MSS) allows the Canadarm2 to travel down the length of the installed truss structure.

=== Flight Day 1: Launch ===
After a launch scrub on 4 April 2002 due to a hydrogen leak, Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; successfully launched on 8 April 2002, from Launch Complex 39B. The countdown on 8 April encountered an unscheduled hold at the T−5-minute mark due to data dropouts in a backup Launch Processing System. The Launch Processing System team reloaded the required data and the countdown resumed. Liftoff occurred with 11 seconds remaining in the launch window.

STS-110 was the first shuttle mission to feature the upgrade Block II main engines, which featured an &quot;improved fuel pump...a stronger integral shaft/disk, and more robust bearings&quot;. The intent of the upgrade was to increase the flight capacity of the engines, while increasing reliability and safety.

With the launch of Atlantis, mission specialist Jerry Ross became the first human to have traveled to space seven times.

<text>STS-111 was a space shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. STS-111 resupplied the station and replaced the Expedition 4 crew with the Expedition 5 crew. It was launched on 5 June 2002, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

==Crew==


==Mission highlights==

STS-111, in addition to providing supplies, rotated the crews aboard the International Space Station, exchanging the three Expedition 4 members (1 Russian, 2 American) for the three Expedition 5 members (2 Russian, 1 American).

The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) carried experiment racks and three stowage and resupply racks to the station. The mission also installed a component of the Canadarm2 called the Mobile Base System (MBS) to the Mobile Transporter (MT) (which was installed during STS-110); This was the second component of the Canadian Mobile Servicing System, or MSS. This gave the mechanical arm the capability to &quot;inchworm&quot; from the U.S. Lab fixture to the MBS and travel along the Truss to work sites.

STS-111 was the last flight of a CNES astronaut, the French agency having disbanded its astronaut group and transferred them to the ESA.

<text>The information superhighway (from ) is a late-20th-century descriptive phrase that aspirationally referred to the increasingly mainstream availability of digital communication systems (and ultimately the Internet and its World Wide Web).

To some extent, it is associated with United States Senator and later Vice President Al Gore.

==Definitions==
There are a number of definitions of this term. The 1996 publication &quot;Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age&quot; defines the term as &quot;the whole digital enchilada - interactive, cable, broadband, 500-channel [...] then-Senator Al Gore Jr. introduced it at a 1978 meeting of computer industry folk, in homage to his father, Senator Albert Gore Sr.&quot;

The &quot;McGraw-Hill Computer Desktop Encyclopedia&quot;, published in 2001, defines the term as &quot;a proposed high-speed communications system that was touted by the Clinton/Gore administration to enhance education in America in the 21st century. Its purpose was to help all citizens regardless of their income level. The Internet was originally cited as a model for this superhighway; however, with the explosion of the World Wide Web, the Internet became the information superhighway&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) defines the term as &quot;a route or network for the high-speed transfer of information; esp. (a) a proposed national fiber-optic network in the United States; (b) the Internet.&quot; The OED also cites usage of this term in three periodicals:
*the January 3, 1983 issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;...information superhighways being built of fiber-optic cable will link Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D. C. in a 776-mile system on the East Coast.&quot;
*the December 19, 1991 issue of the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;: &quot;Senator Gore calls NREN the &quot;information superhighway&quot; - a catalyst for what he hopes will become one day a national fiber-optic network.&quot;
*the October 26, 1993 issue of the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;One of the technologies Vice President Al Gore is pushing is the information superhighway, which will link everyone at home or office to everything else—movies and television shows, shopping services, electronic mail and huge collections of data.&quot;

The working paper No.179, 1994, of the Center for Coordination Science at &quot;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&quot; describes the concept as follows: &quot;The information superhighway directly connects millions of people, each both a consumer of information and a potential provider. (...) Most predictions about commercial opportunities on the information superhighway focus on the provision of information products, such as video on demand, and on new sales outlets for physical products, as with home shopping. (...) The information superhighway brings together millions of individuals who could exchange information with one another. Any conception of a traditional market for making beneficial exchanges, such as an agricultural market or trading pit, or any system where individuals respond to posted prices on a computer screen is woefully inadequate for the extremely large number of often complex trades that will be required.&quot;

==Earlier similar phrases ==
Some other people used the term &quot;superhighway&quot; in application to telecommunications even earlier.

In 1964, M. Brotherton in his book &quot;Masers and Lasers; How They Work, What They Do&quot; on p. 5, wrote about laser beams and used the term &quot;superhighways&quot; for communication.

The term &quot;electronic super highway&quot; was used by RCA engineer James Hillier in 1971 to describe the future evolution of cable television and home communications

&quot;In addition, this cable will run past every bank, school, store, and place of business. It will be an electronic super highway carrying entertainment, education, and informational commerce, making possible a new and closer coupling of the citizen to his society and culture, but from the retained privacy and convenience of his own home.&quot;
In 1974, Nam June Paik also used the term &quot;super highway&quot; in application to telecommunications, which gave rise to the mistaken opinion that he may have been the author of the term &quot;information superhighway&quot;.

In 1972, Andrew Targowski presented the Polish National Development Program at the State Council for Informatics, which included the plan of developing the public computer network INFOSTRADA (INFO-STRADA), with autostrada meaning motorway in Polish. Later this plan and its topology were published in his book INFORMATYKA modele rozwoju i systemów (INFORMATICS, models of development and systems)
&quot;The building of new electronic super highways will become an even huger enterprise. Assuming we connect New York with Los Angeles by means of an electronic telecommunication network that operates in strong transmission ranges, as well as with continental satellites, wave guides, bundled coaxial cable, and later also via laser beam fiber optics: the expenditure would be about the same as for a Moon landing, except that the benefits in term of by-products would be greater.&quot;

<text>Hermann Kurz (30 November 1813 – 10 October 1873) was a German poet and novelist.

He was born at Reutlingen. Having studied at the theological seminary at Maulbronn and at the University of Tübingen, he became assistant pastor at Ehningen. He then entered upon a literary career and lived in Stuttgart. In 1863 he was appointed university librarian at Tübingen, where he remained until his death there.

Kurz&#x27;s collections of poems, &quot;Gedichte&quot; (1836) and &quot;Dichtungen&quot; (1839), were less successful than his historical novels, &quot;Schiller&#x27;s Heimatjahre&quot; (1843) and &quot;Der Sonnenwirt&quot; (1854), and his excellent translations from English, Italian and Spanish. He also published a successful modern German version of Gottfried von Strassburg&#x27;s &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; (1844). His collected works were published in ten volumes (Stuttgart, 1874).

His daughter, Isolde Kurz, was also a poet.

<text>USS &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; was first laid down as &quot;Cheyenne&quot; on 26 October 1942 at Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, but, exactly one month later, was renamed &quot;Vicksburg&quot;. The light cruiser was launched on 14 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Muriel Hamilton, the daughter of Mayor J. C. Hamilton, of Vicksburg, Mississippi; and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 12 June 1944, with Captain William C. Vose in command. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Vicksburg&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
===Construction and initial service===
&quot;Vicksburg&quot; was built by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was laid down on 26 October 1942, originally under the name &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, but was launched as &quot;Vicksburg&quot; on 14 December 1943 with the hull number CL-86. The ship&#x27;s name was changed after one of her sisters, which had initially been given the name &quot;Vicksburg&quot;, was renamed to commemorate the heavy cruiser of the same name that had been sunk at the Battle of Sunda Strait in 1942. After completing fitting-out work, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was commissioned on 12 June 1944. Work to prepare the ship to go to sea lasted into July, when she began her initial sea trials in Chesapeake Bay. On 7 August, she got underway for her shakedown cruise that took the ship as far south as the British West Indies and included training operations in the Gulf of Paria from 12 to 30 August. During this period, she was based in Trinidad. She also conducted shooting practice at the target range off Culebra, Puerto Rico, before departing to return to the United States, escorted by the destroyers and .

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she participated in radar training on 9 September to familiarize her radar operators with identifying and tracking aerial and surface contacts. The next day, she conducted shooting practice with a drone off Cape May. On 11 September, she entered the dry dock at the Boston Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted until 24 September. She thereafter took part in further trials held off Rockland, Maine, and radiation tests in Boston. From 5 October to 15 December, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; served as a training ship for crews of large warships that were awaiting commissioning. During this period, she operated in Narragansett Bay, Block Island Sound, and Long Island Sound. The ship thereafter sailed south to Norfolk for periodic maintenance at the Norfolk Navy Yard, arriving there on 17 December. She conducted a set of trials on 30–31 December, before departing on 1 January 1945, bound for the Pacific. She sailed in company with the destroyers and ; the three ships were designated Task Group (TG) 21.12. They passed through the Panama Canal on 5 January and docked at Balboa, Panama, at on the other end of the canal. There, TG 21.12 was disbanded. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor the next day and arrived there on 17 January; there, she took part in combat practice that included air defense training that consisted of drone target practice, radar detection, and coordination with defending fighter aircraft.

===Pacific Theater operations===
====Battle of Iwo Jima====
On 5 February, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; got underway, bound for Saipan in the Mariana Islands, which she reached eight days later. While there, she refueled from the oiler as the fleet made preparations for the upcoming invasion of Iwo Jima. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was assigned to TG 52.19, which sortied on 14 February. The next day, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was transferred to Task Unit 54.9.2., part of the shore bombardment unit. It included the old dreadnought battleships and , the heavy cruisers and , and several destroyers. &quot;Vicksburg&quot;, &quot;Chester&quot;, and &quot;Pensacola&quot; took up their positions at 06:51 the next morning, and at 07:09, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; launched one of her Vought OS2U Kingfisher seaplanes to help direct her fire. Firing at a range of about , the ship took Japanese positions on the north side of Iwo Jima under fire. Poor weather hampered the aircrews&#x27; ability to observe the ship&#x27;s fire, but &quot;Vicksburg&quot; nevertheless carried out the bombardment for almost an hour, ceasing fire at 08:08.

After recovering and refueling her Kingfisher, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; resumed her bombardment at 09:47, but low visibility still interfered. During a third bombardment later that day, the heavy cloud cover dissipated and permitted much more effective shooting. During this period, at 14:14, a Japanese A6M5 Zero attacked &quot;Vicksburg&quot;″s spotter, but another Kingfisher from &quot;Pensacola&quot; shot the Japanese fighter down, allowing &quot;Vicksburg&quot;″s aircraft to continue supporting the cruiser. At around 14:45, the ship ceased fire again and recovered her Kingfisher. A fourth and final bombardment mission began at 16:18 and concluded at 17:27. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and the rest of TG 52.19 departed for the evening. The ships continued to operate off Iwo Jima more than two weeks, providing fire support to the marines fighting to occupy the island. Later that month, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was detached to form Task Unit 58.1.22 along with her sister ships and , the cruiser , and fifteen destroyers. The unit carried out a raid on the island of Okidaitōjima on 2 March. the On 5 March, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; left for the fleet&#x27;s base at Ulithi to replenish ammunition and stores. While there, she was transferred to Task Force 58, the fast carrier task force, and was assigned to TG 58.1, one of the subordinate carrier battle groups. The task force sortied on 14 March to carry out air strikes in preparation for the upcoming invasion of Okinawa.

====Okinawa campaign and end of the war====
In the early hours of 18 March, as the carriers began their attacks on Japanese positions in the home islands, a Japanese Mitsubishi G4M1 bomber attempted a torpedo attack on &quot;Vicksburg&quot;. The cruiser turned away, narrowly avoiding the torpedo by around . Another Japanese aircraft dropped flares nearby about twenty minutes later before being driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the American fleet; shortly thereafter, it passed back through the American formation and was shot down by the combined fire of several ships, including &quot;Vicksburg&quot;. Further Japanese attacks took place through the morning. A Yokosuka P1Y land-based bomber attempted to dive on one of the carriers, but was shot down by heavy American fire. Some two hours later, a Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber flew over &quot;Vicksburg&quot;; the cruisers&#x27; light gunners scored three hits before the aircraft was shot down by 5-inch fire from other vessels—potentially &quot;Miami&quot; or the destroyer —brought the aircraft down. Over the following days, the American carriers struck many targets in Japan, prompting heavy Japanese counter-attacks. During this period, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; shot down a total of eight Japanese aircraft. She also used her Kingfisher to recover an American pilot who had been shot down off the Japanese coast.

When the invasion of Okinawa began on 1 April, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; returned to coastal bombardment duties. The ship supported the American advance across the southern half of the island, targeting defensive strongpoints, fortified caves, and other defensive positions. She fired thousands of rounds from her 6-inch and 5-inch batteries, at times engaging Japanese positions a few hundred yards from American positions. She nevertheless remained attached to TG 58.1 during the campaign. In the final stage of the fighting on Okinawa, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was detached to escort minesweepers clearing Japanese minefields in the East China Sea. These operations concluded on 24 June, and &quot;Vicksburg&quot; thereafter went to the Philippines. In mid-July, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was assigned to TG 95.7, along with the old battleships and , two other cruisers, and several destroyers. The unit, part of TF 95, was used to patrol off Okinawa and make raids into the East China Sea to interdict Japanese shipping in the area, though &quot;Vicksburg&quot; saw no serious action during this period. In early August, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; joined the escort for the carriers and , along with the cruiser and several destroyers, for a raid on Wake Island. 

&quot;Vicksburg&quot; later returned to the Philippines, where she lay when the Japanese surrendered on 15 August. She then joined Task Unit 30.3.7, which also included the destroyers , , and , which sortied on 20 August, bound for Japan. The ships rendezvoused with the fast carrier strike force, which had by then passed to 3rd Fleet command and been re-numbered TF 38, and on 24 August, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was assigned to TG 38.2. The unit remained outside Tokyo Bay in late August and into September, where the formal surrender ceremony was carried out aboard the fast battleship on 2 September. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and the rest of the task group then entered the bay on 5 September. The cruiser became the flagship of Cruiser Division 10, commanded by Rear Admiral Lloyd J. Wiltse. &quot;Vicksburg&quot; and other elements of TF 38 departed for Okinawa on 20 September, where the ship embarked some 2,200 passengers bound for the United States.

Over the course of the ship&#x27;s participation in World War II, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; earned two battle stars.

===Post-War===
&quot;Vicksburg&quot; and the other ships arrived in Hawaii on 4 October, remaining there for five days before departing for California. The ships arrived in San Francisco Bay, California, on 15 October, passing through a naval review as they entered the port. On 26 October, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; moved to Monterey Bay, California, for the Navy Day celebration the next day. She then sailed for Long Beach, California, where she remained from 31 October to 6 November, when she departed for Portland, Oregon. There, she took part in the Armistice Day celebration on 11 November. The ship then returned to Long Beach five days later, where she remained through the end of the year. On 17 January 1946, &quot;Vicksburg&quot; was drydocked at the Terminal Island Naval Shipyard in Long Beach, California, for a thorough overhaul and modernization. After returning to service, she became the flagship of Third Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral (VAdm) Frederick C. Sherman. The ship moved to Naval Air Station San Diego, where Third Fleet was based. In September, VAdm Alfred E. Montgomery temporarily made &quot;Vicksburg&quot; his flagship. The cruiser was decommissioned on 30 June 1947 as part of the post-war reduction in fleet strength, and she was allocated to the reserve fleet for the next fifteen years. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1962 and sold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation of Terminal Island, California, on 25 August 1964. There, she was broken up.

<text>The Green River Formation is an Eocene geologic formation that records the sedimentation in a group of intermountain lakes in three basins along the present-day Green River in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, a dark layer during the growing season and a light-hue inorganic layer in the dry season. Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm.

The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named for the Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The three separate basins lie around the Uinta Mountains (north, east, and south) of northeastern Utah:
* an area in northwestern Colorado east of the Uintas
* a larger area in the southwest corner of Wyoming just north of the Uintas known as &quot;Lake Gosiute&quot;
* the largest area, in northeastern Utah and western Colorado south of the Uintas, known as &quot;Lake Uinta&quot;

Fossil Butte National Monument in Lincoln County, Wyoming, is in a part of the formation known as &quot;Fossil Lake&quot; because of its abundance of exceptionally well-preserved fish fossils.

==Lithology and formation==

The formation of intermontane basin / lake environments during the Eocene resulted from mountain building and uplift of the Rocky Mountains (late Cretaceous Sevier orogeny and the Paleogene Laramide orogeny). Tectonic highlands supplied the Eocene sedimentary basins with sediment from all directions: the Uinta Mountains in the center; the Wind River Mountains to the north; the Front Range, Park Range and Sawatch Range of the Colorado Rockies to the east; the Uncompahgre Plateau and the San Juan Mountains to the south and finally, the Wasatch Mountains of Utah and the ranges of eastern Idaho to the west.

The lithology of the lake sediments is varied and includes sandstones, mudstones, siltstones, oil shales, coal beds, saline evaporite beds, and a variety of lacustrine limestones and dolomites. Volcanic ash layers within the various sediments from the then active Absaroka Volcanic field to the north in the vicinity of Yellowstone and the San Juan volcanic field to the southeast provide dateable horizons within the sediments.

The trona (hydrated sodium bicarbonate carbonate) beds of Sweetwater County, Wyoming are noted for a variety of rare evaporite minerals. The Green River Formation, is the type locality for eight rare minerals: bradleyite, ewaldite, loughlinite, mckelveyite-(Y), norsethite, paralabuntsovite-Mg, shortite and wegscheiderite. It also has a natural occurrence of moissanite (SiC) and 23 other valid mineral species.

===Cyclicity===
The beds display a pronounced cyclicity, with the precession, obliquity, and eccentricity orbital components all clearly detectable. This enables the beds to be internally dated with a high degree of accuracy, and astrochronological dates agree very well with radiometric dates.

==Fossil zones==

Within the Green River Formation of southwest Wyoming in the area known as &quot;Fossil Lake&quot;, two distinct zones of very fine-grained lime muds are particularly noted for preserving a variety of complete and detailed fossils. These layers are an Eocene Lagerstätte, a rare place where conditions were right for a rich accumulation of undisturbed fossils. The most productive zone—called the &quot;split fish layer&quot;—consists of a series of laminated or varved lime muds about thick, which contains abundant fish and other fossils. These are easily split along the layers to reveal the fossils. This thin zone represents some 4000 years of deposition. The second fossil zone, the &quot;18 inch layer&quot;, is an unlaminated layer about thick that also contains abundant detailed fossils, but is harder to work because it is not composed of fissile laminae.
The limestone matrix is so fine-grained that fossils include rare soft parts of complete insects and fallen leaves in spectacular detail. Some 35,000 fossiliferous rocks from the Green River Formation are housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

Fish fossils of &quot;Diplomystus&quot; and &quot;Knightia&quot; are found in Fossil Lake but not in Lake Gosiute. Only Lake Gosiute has fossils of catfish (Ictaluridae and Hypsidoridae) and suckers (Catostomidae). The catfish are found mostly in the deepest parts of the lake. Percopsid sand-roller relatives are known from all three lakes, however &quot;Amphiplaga&quot; is strictly found in Fossil lake only, while &quot;Erismatopterus&quot; is uncommon in Lake Uinta but common in certain mass mortality layers of Lake Gosiute and absent from Fossil Lake.


The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years old. This span of time includes the transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore ( e.g. &quot;Platanus wyomingensis&quot; ) forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements, receiving sediments from the Uinta highland and the Rocky Mountains to the east and north. The lagerstätten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away, so leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage they had sustained during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets.

Vertebrates were preserved too, including the osteoderms of &quot;Borealosuchus&quot;, the crocodile that was an early clue to the mild Eocene climate of Western North America. Fish are common. The fossils of the herring-like &quot;Knightia&quot;, sometimes in dense layers, as if a school had wandered into anoxic water levels and were overcome, are familiar to fossil-lovers and are among the most commonly available fossils on the commercial market. There were two genera of indigenous freshwater stingray, &quot;Heliobatis&quot; and &quot;Asterotrygon&quot;. Approximately sixty vertebrate taxa in all have been found at Green River. Besides fishes they include at least eleven species of reptiles, and some birds and one armadillo-like mammal, &quot;Brachianodon westorum&quot;, with some scattered vertebrae of others, like the dog-sized &quot;Meniscotherium&quot; and &quot;Notharctus&quot;, one of the first primates. The earliest bats known from complete skeletons (&quot;Icaronycteris index&quot;
, &quot;I. gunnelli&quot;, and &quot;Onychonycteris finneyi&quot;), already full-developed for flight, are found here. Even a snake, &quot;Boavus idelmani&quot;, found its way into a lake and was preserved in the mudstone.

===Discovery of the fossil beds===
The first documented records of (invertebrate) fossils from what is now called the Green River Formation are in the journals of early missionaries and explorers such as S. A. Parker, 1840, and J. C. Fremont, 1845. Geologist Dr. John Evans collected the first fossil fish, described as &quot;Clupea humilis&quot; (later renamed &quot;Knightia eocaena&quot;), from the Green River beds in 1856. Edward Drinker Cope collected extensively from the area and produced several publications on the fossil fish from 1870 onwards. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden (geologist-in-charge of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, the forerunner of the United States Geological Survey) first used the name &quot;Green River Shales&quot; for the fossil sites in 1869.

Millions of fish fossils have been collected from the area, commercial collectors operating from legal quarries on state and private land have been responsible for the majority of Green River vertebrate fossils in public and private collections all over the world.

==Oil shale==


The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposit in the world. It has been estimated that the oil shale reserves could equal up to of shale oil, up to half of which may be recoverable by shale oil extraction technologies (pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution of kerogen in oil shale). However, the estimates of recoverable oil has been questioned, back in 2013, by geophysicist Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, who argued that the technology for recovering oil from the Green River oil shale deposit had not been developed and had not been profitably implemented at any significant scale.

Green River oil shale is lacustrine type lamosite. The organic matter is from blue-green algae (cyanobacteria).

==Notable mineral deposits==
The unusual chemistry of the lakes in which it was deposited makes the Green River Formation a major source of sodium carbonate. In southwest Wyoming the formation contains the world&#x27;s largest deposits of trona, and in Colorado, the world&#x27;s largest deposits of nahcolite. Another unusual mineral, currently only known from the Parachute Creek member is the crystalline nickel porphyrin mineral abelsonite.

<doc id="557375" wikidata="Q7871774" url="?curid=557375" title="USS Miami (CL-89)">
<text>USS &quot;Miami&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

&quot;Miami&quot; was commissioned in December 1943, and saw service in several campaigns in the Pacific. Like almost all her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and never saw active service again. &quot;Miami&quot; was scrapped in the early 1960s.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Miami&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Miami&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
===Construction and initial training===
The keel for &quot;Miami&quot; was laid down at William Cramp &amp; Sons in Philadelphia on 2 August 1941. She was launched on 8 December 1942, and after completing fitting-out work, was commissioned into the fleet on 28 December 1943, with the hull number CL-89. The ship began sea trials on the Delaware River on 1 January 1944, and from 21 January to 3 February, she remained at Philadelphia for modifications and to take on a load of ammunition. She got underway on 4 February to resume training operations in Delaware Bay that lasted until 7 February, when she joined the destroyer to sail for Chesapeake Bay for further training. On 12 February, &quot;Miami&quot; moved to the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, before departing two days later in company with the heavy cruiser and the destroyers and . The four ships steamed south to Trinidad in the British West Indies for a shakedown cruise. While en route, one of &quot;Miami&quot;″s crew fell overboard and couldn&#x27;t be found.

Over the next two weeks, &quot;Miami&quot; took part in drills with the other ships in the Gulf of Paria until 3 March, when she and &quot;Quincy&quot; left to return to Norfolk, this time escorted by the destroyers and . They arrived four days later, where &quot;Miami&quot; was inspected by Rear Admiral Donald B. Beary. On 11 March, the ship sailed for the Naval Research Laboratory Annex in Chesapeake Bay for tests the following day. She then returned to Delaware Bay on the 13th, and then to Philadelphia on 14 March for repairs that lasted through the end of the month. On 2 April, the ship was moved to Boston, Massachusetts, departing there on 7 April for Casco Bay, Maine, where she conducted shooting practice with her sister ship , the destroyer , and the destroyer escort . After a week of practice, &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;Edwards&quot; then sailed back to Boston on 14 April.

The Navy thereafter ordered &quot;Miami&quot; to sail for the Pacific, and she departed on 16 April. For the voyage south, she was assigned to Task Group (TG) 27.7, which also included her sisters &quot;Houston&quot; and and the destroyers &quot;Edwards&quot;, , , and . They passed through the Panama Canal on 22 April, and the next day, the unit was re-designated TG 12.3 and &quot;Broome&quot; and &quot;Simpson&quot; were detached. The rest of the ships proceeded on to San Diego, California, arriving there on 30 April. From there, the task group sailed for Pearl Harbor the next day, arriving there on 6 May. While there, &quot;Miami&quot; joined the heavy cruiser for training exercises on 8 May. She thereafter underwent maintenance from 13 to 24 May.

===Operations in the Pacific Theater===
====Mariana and Palau Islands campaign====

&quot;Miami&quot; was next transferred to TG 12.1, which also included the fast battleships and , the cruisers &quot;Vincennes&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot;, the minelayer , and the destroyers , , , , and . The unit departed on 24 May, bound for Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and arrived there six days later. They then joined the Fast Carrier Task Force, then under the command of 5th Fleet and designated Task Force (TF) 58. &quot;Miami&quot; was assigned to the subordinate unit TG 58.4, which also included the aircraft carriers , , and . The American fleet embarked on the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, beginning with air strikes against Japanese positions on Saipan on 11 June and continuing over the following week. &quot;Miami&quot; contributed to the fleet&#x27;s anti-aircraft defenses when the Japanese launched an aerial counterattack on 19 June, though she was not heavily engaged. Later that day, the ship&#x27;s secondary guns opened fire on what was believed to be a Japanese submarine but was in fact merely an abandoned sampan.

&quot;Miami&quot; continued to escort the carriers as they launched air strikes in support of the invasion of Saipan until 27 June, when she was detached as part of Task Unit 58.4.5 and sent bombard Guam before American forces landed on that island as well. The unit included &quot;Houston&quot; and five destroyers. In addition to Japanese positions on the island, &quot;Miami&quot; shelled a cargo ship that was moored in Apra Harbor. A Japanese coastal artillery battery on the Orote Peninsula engaged &quot;Miami&quot; during the bombardment, and the latter eventually silenced the Japanese guns. &quot;Miami&quot; and the other vessels thereafter returned to their positions screening the carriers. On 6 July, &quot;Miami&quot; was sent to Eniwetok to replenish stores and ammunition before returning to the fleet on 14 June. By that time, she had been transferred to TG 58.3, which was centered on the carriers , , and . The ships anchored at Saipan on 31 July, by which time had been secured by American forces. The next morning, the ships sortied to carry out a raid on Japanese installations on Iwo Jima. &quot;Miami&quot; was again detached for replenishment and maintenance at Eniwetok on 11 August. She joined TU 58.2.1 on 25 August, along with her sister and four destroyers.

On 26 August, &quot;Miami&quot; left the fleet to pick up the crew from a OS2U Kingfisher from the battleship , but she was recalled before she arrived. By this time, the Fast Carrier Task Force had passed to the command of the Third Fleet, and all of the units were renumbered. &quot;Miami&quot; was transferred to TG 38.2, which included the carriers &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, , and , the light carriers and , and the fast battleships and . She escorted the carriers that struck Japanese positions on Peleliu and Anguar in the Palau Islands on 7 September to prepare for the invasion of Peleliu. The fleet thereafter shifted its attention to Japanese airfields in the Philippines from 12 to 15 September; during this period, on the 14th, &quot;Miami&quot; picked up the pilot of an F6F Hellcat that had been shot down. The ship steamed to Saipan on 28 September to replenish ammunition and stores.

====Philippines campaign====

As the fleet began preparations for the next major campaign, &quot;Miami&quot; joined TF 34, along with the battleships &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Iowa&quot;, and and the carrier for training exercises that ended the next day. Later on the 30th, &quot;Miami&quot; sailed to the fleet&#x27;s advance base at Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands, where she joined TG 38.2. On 6 October, &quot;Miami&quot; and the rest of the Fast Carrier Task Force sortied to conduct air strikes against Japanese installations on Okinawa and Formosa, which began on 10 October. Two days later, during strikes on Formosa, Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet, and late that day, &quot;Miami&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners shot down one aircraft and assisted in the destruction of another. In the early hours of 13 October, she shot down another Japanese aircraft. With the invasion of Leyte approaching, the fleet turned its attention to Japanese forces in the Philippines on 18 October, striking targets in Aparri and Laoag. Two days later, American forces went ashore on Leyte, leading to heavy Japanese counterattacks.

Japanese efforts to disrupt the landing culminated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, an effort by three squadrons to attack the invasion fleet. After the American carrier task force was drawn north by a feint from the Northern Force, the main Japanese unit, the Center Force, attempted to penetrate the San Bernardino Strait. &quot;Miami&quot; remained with the carriers until the Center Force encountered a group of American escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts on the morning of 25 October. Frantic calls for support from the Fast Carrier Task Force led its commander, Admiral William Halsey Jr. to detach a group of ships, including &quot;Miami&quot;, south to stop the Center Force. By the time they arrived, the Japanese had broken off their attack, convinced they had stumbled into TF 38 itself. &quot;Miami&quot; and several cruisers and destroyers nevertheless caught and sank the destroyer on 26 October.

The following day, &quot;Miami&quot; and the rest of TG 38.2 briefly withdrew eastward before resuming operations against Japanese forces in the Philippines. These consisted of a series of strikes on airfields on Luzon from 5 to 6 November, after which &quot;Miami&quot; was detached to return to Ulithi, where she remained from 9 to 13 November. She sortied the next day to rejoin her unit, which carried out further attacks on Luzon from 18 to 25 November. Through this period, Japanese aircraft repeatedly attacked the fleet, and during one attack on the 25th, &quot;Miami&quot; shot down a dive bomber. Another brief return to Ulithi to replenish fuel and ammunition followed the next day, and she thereafter took part in training exercises there for a week. The ship next joined TG 30.4, which sortied on 9 December to wage additional attacks on Luzon from 14 to 16 December. She was present when the fleet was struck by Typhoon Cobra on 18 December, which sank three destroyers and inflicted serious damage to several ships, including &quot;Miami&quot;. The ship had serious hull damage between frames 21 and 33. One of her Kingfishers was thrown overboard and the other was so badly damaged that the crew discarded it. She remained in the area to assist in the search for survivors before returning to Ulithi on 24 December.

After repairs were completed, &quot;Miami&quot; joined TG 38.3, which sortied on 1 January 1945 to carry out the South China Sea raid. The raid was an effort to isolate Japanese forces in the Philippines by neutralizing airfields in occupied China, Formosa, and Southeast Asia. The fleet&#x27;s carriers initially struck targets on and around Formosa, turned to attack Luzon once more from 6 to 8 January, before entering the South China Sea in the early hours of 10 January. The carriers then launched strikes on Japanese-occupied French Indochina before turning back north to attack Formosa again on 15 and 16 January. On the latter day, &quot;Miami&quot; shot down an A6M5 Zero fighter. The fleet thereafter passed through the Balintang Channel and then the Luzon Strait, continuing north to launch an attack on Okinawa on 20 and 21 January. The fleet thereafter returned to Ulithi to make preparations for the next major offensive, arriving there on 27 January.

====Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign====


On 10 February, &quot;Miami&quot; and the rest of the fleet sortied to begin its next major operation, beginning with supporting attacks for the invasion of Iwo Jima. By this time, the fleet had passed back to 5th Fleet command, and &quot;Miami&quot; had been transferred to TG 58.1. The fleet began air strikes on Tokyo on the night of 15 February, which continued over the following two days. On 18 February, the fleet sailed south to attack Japanese positions on Chichijima, followed by strikes on Okinawa from 20 to 22 February, by which time American forces had begun the invasion of Iwo Jima. Later that month, &quot;Miami&quot; was detached to form Task Unit 58.1.22 along with her sister ships and , the cruiser , and fifteen destroyers. The unit carried out a raid on the island of Okidaitōjima on 2 March. Three days later, she returned to Ulithi to replenish fuel and munitions. She got underway again on 14 March and rejoined the Fast Carrier Task Force, which raided Japanese installations on Okinawa and the main island of Kyushu between 18 and 31 March. During this period, &quot;Miami&quot; helped to defend the fleet against heavy Japanese air attacks. Still part of TG 58.1, she escorted the carriers , , and as they directly supported American forces during the battle of Okinawa beginning on 1 April. These operations continued through 11 April.

The next day, &quot;Miami&quot; took part in searches for American pilots who had been shot down during the fighting around Okinawa; that afternoon, Kingfishers from &quot;Miami&quot; recovered one man from the water and a further two from Amami Ōshima. On 14 April, &quot;Miami&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners claimed several Japanese planes shot down during a particularly heavy attack. TF 58 began attacks on Amami Ōshima, Tokuno Shima, and Kikaijima from 20 to 30 April. &quot;Miami&quot; returned to Ulithi later that day, remaining there for repairs and replenishment for more than a week. On 10 May, &quot;Miami&quot; departed for Pearl Harbor, sailing independently and arriving seven days later. There, she embarked passengers bound for the West Coast of the United States, and carried them to San Pedro, California. She reached the port on 24 May, unloaded ammunition, and then entered the dry dock the following day for an overhaul. The work lasted more than a month, and the ship re-entered the water on 7 July. She conducted limited trials on 14 July and was thoroughly inspected between 1 and 11 August. She departed for Pearl Harbor on 20 August, arriving four days later; by that time, Japan had announced it would surrender, ending the war. &quot;Miami&quot; left for Guam on 30 August, and while en route on 2 September, the formal surrender took place aboard the battleship . For her service during the conflict, &quot;Miami&quot; was awarded six battle stars.

===Post-war operations===

&quot;Miami&quot; departed for Okinawa on 9 September, accompanied by the destroyer escort . After arriving there on 12 September, she was used to accept the surrender of Japanese garrisons in the Ryukyu Islands. Four days later, she went to sea along with TF 55 to avoid a major typhoon; she returned to Buckner Bay in Okinawa on 17 September. On 22 September, she covered the arrival of Tenth Army to begin occupation duties in the Ryukus. Another typhoon forced &quot;Miami&quot; back to sea on 3 October. Four days later, she dropped anchor in Naze, Kagoshima on the island of Amami Ōshima. After patrolling the area for several days, she returned to Buckner Bay on 15 October. She remained there until 29 October, when she got underway to visit Yokosuka, Japan, though she remained there for only a short time before sailing south to the Caroline Islands, ultimately arriving in Truk on 11 November. Her crew conducted a survey of the damage inflicted during Operation Hailstone, a major carrier raid on the atoll during the war. &quot;Miami&quot; was ordered home on 25 November, and she arrived in Long Beach, California, on 10 December.

For the next year and a half, &quot;Miami&quot; operated off the coast of California, conducting training cruises for naval reservists. She was decommissioned on 30 June 1947 and thereafter assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1 September 1961, when she was stricken from the naval register. The ship was then sold for scrap to the shipbreaking firm Nicholai Joffe Corp. on 26 July 1962.

<text>Conium ( or ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. , Plants of the World Online accepts six species.

All species of the genus are poisonous to humans. &quot;C. maculatum&quot;, also known as hemlock, is infamous for being highly poisonous. Hemlock is native to temperate regions of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. The species &quot;C. chaerophylloides&quot;, &quot;C. fontanum&quot;, and &quot;C. sphaerocarpum&quot; are all native to southern Africa.

== Description ==
Plants of the genus &quot;Conium&quot; are eudicots, flowering plants distinguished by their two cotyledons (embryonic leaves) and tricolpate (three-pored) pollen. They are typically biennial, forming basal rosettes in the first year of growth, and sprouting a rigid, hollow flower stalk in the second. Germination occurs between spring and autumn. Occasionally, plants which germinate in early spring are annual instead of biennial. These plants grow best in wet, poorly drained areas with nutrient rich soil. They grow well in nitrogen rich soil, and are able to tolerate high levels of heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead. &quot;Conium&quot; plants are diploid, with a chromosome number of 2n = 22 (haploid number 11). They grow from one to three meters tall, varying between species. They produce hermaphroditic flowers, which are typically insect pollinated or self-fertilized.  

=== Stems ===
&quot;Conium&quot; plants are herbaceous, growing non-woody, hollow, and hairless stems. Generally, the stem is striated and light green; however, the coloring varies by species and variety. Some express purple blotching throughout, some have purple blotching localized near the base, and others have no markings at all.

=== Leaves ===
The alternate leaves are pinnately compound and finely divided, with the exact pinnation patterns varying between species and leaf type. For example, stem leaves of &quot;C. maculatum&quot; plants are typically 2-4 pinnate, but basal leaves are 1-3 pinnate. The leaves and petioles are light green. Similar to the stem coloring, some species and varieties express purple blotching on the leaves and petioles.

=== Flowers ===
Terminal inflorescences are made up of many small flowers, colored white, yellow, or green depending on the species. The flowers are grouped together in umbrella shaped umbels. Plants in the genus &quot;Conium&quot; have compound umbels, with multiple dome shaped clusters branching out from a central point. Flowers are around 2 mm across, and the umbrella shaped umbels range from 1–8 cm in diameter.

==== Fruits ====
The two seeded fruit is one of the most significant distinguishing factors between species. They are relatively round, slightly flattened, and dark green or brown. Depending on the species, they range from 2.5 to 4 mm long. Some species have distinctive light brown ribs, some have ribs that are noticeably crenulate (scalloped edges), and others show relatively unpronounced rib patterns.

==== Seeds ====
Each plant typically produces between 1,700 and 39,000 seeds, and 40-85% will germinate in suitable conditions. However, seeds will remain viable for 3 to 6 years after dispersal. Producing a large number of seeds, and growing in a variety of locations, these plants can be considered invasive in some cases.

=== Chemical composition ===
Poisonous alkaloid compounds are present in all tissues of &quot;Conium&quot; plants. As a flower develops into a fruit and matures, the alkaloids present transform from γ-coniceine, to coniine, and finally to N-methylconiine. When ingested, these compounds interrupt the central nervous system, paralyzing respiratory muscles, and finally resulting in death through respiratory failure.

=== Species differentiation from other plants ===
Members of the genus &quot;Conium&quot; can be easily confused with edible plants of the family Apiaceae. &quot;Conium&quot; plants have leaves similar to parsley (&quot;Petroselinum crispum&quot;) and roots similar to parsnip (&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;). However, a few characteristics can be used to distinguish the poisonous &quot;Conium&quot; plants from other harmless Apiaceae plants. For example, &quot;Conium&quot; leaves and stems release a foul odor when crushed. Additionally, the species &quot;C. maculatum&quot; stands out with its purple blotching pattern.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus name &quot;Conium&quot; references the Greek word &quot;koneios&quot; for &#x27;spin&#x27; or &#x27;whirl&#x27;, alluding to the dizzying effects of the plant&#x27;s poison after ingestion. In the vernacular, &quot;hemlock&quot; most commonly refers to the species &quot;C. maculatum&quot;, but it also refers to &quot;Cicuta&quot; species (water hemlock), where both species are similar in physical features, and both are highly toxic.

The genus &quot;Conium&quot; was erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Several botanists, such as J.F.M. Cannon, G.H. Leute, and J.H. Ross, have historically made the argument that southern African species of &quot;Conium&quot; has few significant distinctions. Some even claim that the genus has no independent species at all. They argue that the populations in southern Africa &quot;may be the result of the chance introduction of a few individuals which represented genetically a very limited range of the total variability of the species.&quot; Some believe that each species of &quot;Conium&quot; is synonymous to &quot;C. maculatum&quot;. Others believe that there are two to three distinct southern African species of &quot;Conium&quot;.

=== History ===

Conium was known to ancient Greeks, who used it for its narcotic properties and in capital punishment. It was used for the execution, among others, of Socrates and Theramenes.

&quot;Conium maculatum&quot;, also known as poison hemlock, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 publication, Species Plantarum. It was the first described species within the genus. &quot;Maculatum&quot; means spotted, referencing the purple blotches characteristic of this species.

&quot;Conium chaerophylloides&quot; was described by Danish plant collector Christian Friedrich Ecklon (1795–1868) and German botanist Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher. In 1828, they came together in South Africa, forming a partnership. For the next decade, they built their collection, describing almost 2000 genera and species.

Both &quot;C. fontanum&quot; and &quot;C. sphaerocarpum&quot; were described by South African botanist Olive Mary Hilliard and English botanist Brian Laurence Burtt. Together, they published their classifications in the South African Journal of Botany in 1985.

=== Species ===
, Plants of the World Online accepts six species:
*&quot;Conium chaerophylloides&quot; 
*&quot;Conium divaricatum&quot; 
*&quot;Conium fontanum&quot; 
*&quot;Conium hilliburttorum&quot; 
*&quot;Conium maculatum&quot; 
*&quot;Conium sphaerocarpum&quot; 

==== &quot;Conium chaerophylloides&quot; ====
&quot;Conium chaerophylloides&quot;, growing two to three meters tall, can be distinguished by its unique yellow-green flowers. Groups of many of these small flowers make up obconical umbels. The outer rays (individual flowers) form an angle with the point of attachment, giving the umbel a cone-like shape, which fans out from the base of the inflorescence. They produce round, 4 mm long, dark brown or green fruit, with deep, lightly colored ridges.

==== &quot;Conium fontanum&quot; ====
&quot;Conium fontanum&quot; expresses a similar obconical umbel arrangement, but produces slightly larger fruit, and develops the white flowers characteristic of the other species in the &quot;Conium&quot; genus. The fruit is usually larger than 4 mm long, with ridges of the same dark green or brown color as the rest of the ovary. These plants grow one to three meters tall, depending on the variety.

==== &quot;Conium hilliburttorum&quot; ====
&quot;Conium hilliburttorum&quot; has not always been recognized as a distinct species within the genus. Like &quot;C. sphaerocarpum&quot;, these plants have white flowers grouped in hemispherical umbels and small fruit. However, these researchers argue that the fruit and ovary anatomy significantly distinguish them from &quot;C. sphaerocarpum&quot;. They develop similar sized fruit; however, &quot;C. hilliburttorum&quot; fruit displays prominent ribs, whereas &quot;C. sphaerocarpum&quot; fruit is relatively smooth. &quot;C. hilliburttorum&quot; ovaries are covered in tubercules, or small lumpy outgrowths, like &quot;C. chaerophylloides&quot; fruit. However, &quot;C. chaerophylloides&quot; plants have yellow or green flowers, and they grow much larger fruit and are much taller.

==== &quot;Conium maculatum&quot; ====
&quot;Conium maculatum&quot; is distinguished by red or purple blotching along the hairless green stem. Some varieties of the southern African species express a moderate degree of blotching at the base of the stem, but most are simply green. It grows white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters.

==== &quot;Conium sphaerocarpum&quot; ====
&quot;Conium sphaerocarpum&quot; produces similarly colored, but slightly smaller fruit, less than 3.5 mm long. The ovary is relatively smooth, with almost completely flat, inconspicuous ridges. Additionally, the small white flowers are arranged in hemispherical umbels. Each umbel&#x27;s outer rays protrude horizontally, forming a semi-sphere shape, with the flat edge at the base of the umbel, and the dome pointing away from the point of attachment. This species tends to grow shorter than others within the genus.

== Evolution ==
&quot;Conium&quot; is a genus within the family Apiaceae. The family Apiaceae originates from Australasia in the Late Cretaceous period. &quot;Conium&quot; is specifically part of the Apioideae subfamily which split off from the other subfamilies of Apiaceae between 45.9 and 71.2 million years ago in southern Africa.

=== Toxin development ===
The evolution of toxicity within &quot;Conium&quot; plants and within &quot;Apiaceae&quot; plants has several theories. &quot;Apiaceae&quot; plants contain secondary compounds which are compounds that are often limited to just a family, genus, or a species of plant that varies among those smaller groups and is unlikely to be essential to the day-to-day physiological needs of the plant. These secondary compounds are used to mediate the plants interactions with other organisms, such as the prevention of herbivory. Gottfried S. Fraenkel in 1959 called the distribution of secondary compounds within Apiaceae and other families reciprocal adaptive evolution. Ehrlich and Raven in 1964 called Fraenkel&#x27;s process coevolution. They claimed that secondary compounds diversify by emerging as a novel compound that protects a plant from herbivory. Due to this protection from herbivory and mutation or recombination in an insect, the plant can become susceptible to herbivory once more if an insect evolves the means to detoxify or tolerate the toxin created by the secondary compound. With this new trait, the insect has a new adaptive zone with which it can diversify and the plant has a certain set of adapted herbivores. This is seen with &quot;Conium&quot;, where &quot;C. maculatum&quot; has an adaptive herbivore, &quot;Agonopterix alstromeriana&quot;.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Conium maculatum&quot; is native to northern Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. &quot;C. chaerophylloides&quot;, &quot;C. fontanum&quot;, and &quot;C. sphaerocarpum&quot; are all native to southern Africa.

&quot;Conium maculatum&quot; has been introduced to the Americas, southern Africa, China, New Zealand, and Australia. It was originally brought to the United States from Europe as a garden plant. &quot;C. maculatum&quot; has been introduced to other parts of the world due to the transportation of grain. In many areas which &quot;C. maculatum&quot; has been introduced, it has become an invasive species.

== Ecology ==
All species of &quot;Conium&quot; are poisonous to humans and several other species of mammals; yet, some serve as food sources for some insects. In addition, the invasiveness of &quot;Conium&quot; species into non-native habitats is documented. It is unknown what the spread of &quot;Conium&quot; into new environments is primarily driven by.

=== Dispersal ===
Seeds of the Conium plants fall close to the parent and primarily rely on abiotic and biotic vector transmissions for dispersal. For biotic transmissions, rodents and birds have been documented to spread seeds, with them clinging to the animals&#x27; fur. Human introductions of the plants from their native into new habitats (either accidentally through seed contamination or intentional as a garden plant or medicinal herb) is also a proposed cause of the plant being invasive in several regions, but these are not common.

=== Ecological relationships ===
As a weed, &quot;Conium&quot; plants can spread into grasslands and other areas with low vegetation and crowd out local grass species. The plants spread very quickly and are very competitive with native grasses.

&quot;Conium&quot; plants use their toxicity as a way to mediate their ecological interactions with other species. Despite the &quot;Conium&quot; plants being poisonous, several invertebrates and some insects have evolved mechanisms for avoiding toxicity of chemicals when feeding on the plants. One species of moth, &quot;Agonopterix alstroemeriana&quot;, infests &quot;C. maculatum&quot;.

The plants serve as a host for several viruses, bacteria, and insects, including the carrot rust fly, &quot;Psila rosae;&quot; the bacterium &quot;Xylella fastidiosa;&quot; carrot thin leaf virus; celery mosaic virus; and alfalfa mosaic virus. In 2015, a novel Poison Hemlock Virus Y (PHVY) was isolated from leaf samples of &quot;C. maculatum&quot; with mild mosaic and vein yellowing symptoms, collected from fields in south-east Iran. The virus was shown serologically to be related to potyviruses.&quot;&quot;

=== Economic impact ===
&quot;Conium&quot; plants are poisonous to a variety of animals including cows, sheep, goats, swine, rabbits, elk, poultry, and humans. Some of the impacts of the consumption of these plants on animals include muscle spasms, diarrhea, depression, skeletal malformations, and death. In fact, the most important losses from &quot;Conium&quot; plants is through livestock toxicity. An estimated yearly loss of livestock to these plants in the western US was $340 million.

Although they are mostly found in non-crop fields, &quot;Conium&quot; plants compete with commercial agricultural plants, including several types of vegetables and grains. It has been found growing in corn, chickpea, vegetable, and orchard fields. Regions affected include Oceania, the Iberian peninsula, central Europe, and the United States. Economic losses of crops due to Conium invasion is not as widespread or severe as its affecting of animals farms, and there is little crop loss data available from those regions.

== Uses ==
Historically, the leaves and flowers of &quot;Conium&quot; plant species were prized for their decorative appearance, and they were bred and kept as ornamental decorative plants. &quot;Conium&quot; plants were also used as natural barriers and in medicine as treatments. As knowledge that chemicals produced by &quot;Conium&quot; plants were toxic to humans and mammals became widespread, their usage as decorative plants and as treatments have declined.

Today, species of the &quot;Conium&quot; genus have no known uses, and they are classified as a weed. However, notably, &quot;C. maculatum&quot; continues to be used in medicine as an ingredient. In addition, the production of toxic chemicals that have limited their widespread public use has instigated research in the chemicals&#x27; potential applications in agriculture.

=== Pesticides ===
Chemicals produced by and isolated from plants of this genus were found to have anti-insect and anti-predator properties and have been studied for use in agriculture. Coniine was proven to be effective against aphids and blowflies. In addition, extracts of &quot;Conium&quot; plants were found to inhibit &quot;Fusarium pallidoroseum,&quot; a fungal disease causing twig blight in mulberry. However, these findings have not yet been implemented in practice.

=== In medicine ===
Extracts of &quot;Conium&quot; plants were used as sedatives and antispasmodics. Because of the plants&#x27; toxicities, uses as a medicine were discontinued by the early 20th century.

Today, there are no accepted uses for the &quot;Conium&quot; genus plants as a treatment. Despite severe safety concerns and a lack of supporting scientific evidence, &quot;C. maculatum&quot; has continued to be used as homeopathy or home remedy treatment for several medical conditions including anxiety, muscle spasms, bronchitis, whooping cough, asthma, and arthritis. There is little information on the plant&#x27;s interactions with other drugs and on treatment doses.

=== Other uses ===
&quot;Conium maculatum&quot; was introduced into North America as an ornamental plant, imported into the United States and southern Canada. Plant hobbyists continue to cultivate this plant species today.

As plants of the &quot;Conium&quot; species are known to be dangerous to mammals, they are also used as natural fences between tracts of land to block predatory animals such as wolves. It is grown along streams or rivers and near fences and pastures.

== Toxicity ==
All species of &quot;Conium&quot; are highly toxic to humans, many other mammals, and birds (in larger doses). Virtually all parts of the plant are poisonous to humans, and consumption of any part of the plant can cause poisoning. In most cases, poisoning occurs from a misidentification of the plant as an edible species, such as &quot;C. maculatum&quot; root with wild parsnips or its leaves with parsley.

=== Effects on humans and other animals ===
&quot;Conium maculatum&quot; is especially known to be dangerous to pregnant and breast-feeding females and in children, where poisoning has occurred by consuming small amounts of &quot;C. maculatum&quot;. An overdose of &quot;Conium maculatum&quot; can typically produce paralysis, with a toxic dose causing loss of speech followed by inhibited respiratory function and, later, death. This plant species and others in the &quot;Conium&quot; genus are also toxic in larger mammals, including bovine, equestrian, and other domestic animals. They are also known to cause birth defects in domesticated animals. Birds do not appear to be affected as severely when consuming these seeds of these plants, but they can also be poisoned in larger doses.

=== Pharmacology ===
In hemlock, eight piperidine alkaloids, known to cause strong physiological effects, were isolated. Two of the eight compounds, g-coniceine and coniine, were measured as having the highest concentration, and they contribute to the plant&#x27;s toxicity. Other alkaloids that have been identified in hemlock include methyl coniine, ethyl piperidine and .

In larger animals, acute toxicity doses for &quot;C. maculatum&quot; are lower for pigs compared to cattle, and for sheep compared to goats. Specifically, toxicity doses are 3.3 mg/kg for cattle, 15.5 mg/kg for horses and 44.0 mg/kg for sheep.

=== Treatment ===
Gastric lavage is performed on larger animals who have consumed &quot;Conium&quot; plants. For animals who have started to show symptoms, support respiration and treatment with activated charcoal and a saline cathartic are used. Support respiration and activated charcoal treatment is also given to human patients who have ingested &quot;Conium&quot; plants.

=== As a poison ===
The Greek philosopher Socrates famously died by goading a jury into sentencing him to death by hemlock (see .) &quot;Conium maculatum&quot; (poison hemlock) is infamous in its use as a poison. A small overdose of extract of the plant causes paralysis with higher toxic doses causing a ceasing of respiratory function followed by death. Poison hemlock was historically used in official executions and assassinations.

== Cultivation ==
Historically, &quot;Conium&quot; species has been grown as ornamental plants. As it has attractive flowers to some plant breeders, it was introduced to the US from Europe as a garden plant. However, there have been documented cases where there was an improper cultivation of plants, where the species, notably &quot;C. maculatum,&quot; is mistaken with common edible plants such as parsnip, parsley, wild celery, and anise and is farmed for human consumption accidentally.

Today, intentional introduction of &quot;Conium&quot; plants as a garden plant or live specimen for herbal medicine into new and existing regions is less likely.

== Notes ==
1 Species names have &quot;Conium&quot; abbreviated as &quot;C&quot;. followed by the species taxonomy.

<doc id="557394" wikidata="Q1149484" url="?curid=557394" title="Keihanshin">
<text>is a metropolitan region in the Kansai region of Japan encompassing the metropolitan areas of the cities of Kyoto in Kyoto Prefecture, Osaka in Osaka Prefecture and Kobe in Hyōgo Prefecture. The entire region has a population () of 19,302,746 over an area of . It is the second-most-populated urban region in Japan (after the Greater Tokyo area), containing approximately 15% of Japan&#x27;s population.

The GDP in Osaka–Kobe is $681 billion as measured by PPP , making it one of the world&#x27;s most productive regions, a match with Paris and London. MasterCard Worldwide reported that Osaka is the 19th ranking city of the world&#x27;s leading global cities and has an instrumental role in driving the global economy. If Keihanshin were a country, it would be the 16th-largest economy in the world, with a GDP of nearly $953.9 billion in 2012.

==Name==
The name &quot;Keihanshin&quot; is constructed by extracting a representative &quot;kanji&quot; from &quot;Kyoto&quot; , &quot;Osaka&quot; , and &quot;Kobe&quot; . For the characters taken from &quot;Osaka&quot; and &quot;Kobe&quot;, the Chinese reading is used instead of the corresponding native reading. For the character taken from &quot;Kyoto&quot;, the &quot;Kan-on&quot; Chinese reading is used instead of the usual &quot;Go-on&quot; Chinese reading.

== Definitions==
===Major Metropolitan Area===

The Japan Statistics Bureau defines a Major Metropolitan Area or MMA () as a set of municipalities where at least 1.5% of the resident population aged 15 and above commute to school or work in a designated city (defined as the core area). If multiple designated cities are close enough to have overlapping outlying areas, they are combined into a single multi-core area. In the 2005 census, the designated cities used to define the Keihanshin MMA were Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Sakai has subsequently become a designated city.

This region consists of the combination of the metropolitan areas of Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, and Himeji, and additionally includes several periurban areas (particularly in eastern Shiga Prefecture) that are not part of the four metropolitan areas.

, the entire Keihanshin region had a population of 19,302,746 over an area of .
=== Range of distance===
The Japan Statistics Bureau defines the set of municipalities that are entirely or mostly within of the Municipal Office of Osaka as one measure of the metropolitan area. , the population for this region was 16,260,117.

===Urban Employment Area===

The Urban Employment Area is a metropolitan area definition developed at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Tokyo. This definition is comparable to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States. The basic building blocks are municipalities.

The core area is the set of municipalities that contain a &quot;densely inhabited district&quot; (DID) with a population of 10,000 or more. The Urban Employment Area is called Metropolitan Employment Area, when its core area has 50,000 DID population or more. Otherwise, the area is called Micropolitan Employment Area. A DID is a group of census enumeration districts inhabited at densities of 4,000 or more persons per km2. Outlying areas are those municipalities where 10% or more of the employed population work in the core area or in another outlying area. Overlaps are not allowed and an outlying area is assigned to the core area where it has the highest commuter ratio.

This definition assigns a Metropolitan Employment Area to the following cities of the Keihanshin region: Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Himeji, and Wakayama. The lists below indicate which cities belong to which metropolitan area. Towns and villages are not listed.

==Transportation==



=== Air===
There are two major airports. The fairly centrally located Osaka International Airport, laid over the border between the cities of Itami and Toyonaka, serves primarily domestic routes.

Kansai International Airport opened in 1994 and is now the main international airport for the region. It sits on an artificial island well off-shore in Osaka Bay towards the Wakayama outlet. Kansai is the geographical term for the area of western Honshū surrounding Osaka. The airport island link to the mainland via the Sky Gate Bridge R, containing a six lane expressway and the Kansai Airport Line, a rail link connecting to the Hanwa Line, which connects Wakayama to Osaka. Limited express trains offer non-stop service to Osaka and onward to Kyoto. Local connections are made to other areas. Highway buses also offer service to many areas.

Kobe Airport, built on a reclaimed island south of Port Island opened in 2006, offering domestic flights.

=== Rail===
Keihanshin has a very extensive network of railway lines, comparable to that of Greater Tokyo. Main rail terminals in the cities include, Umeda/Osaka, Namba, Tennoji, Sannomiya, and Kyoto.

==== High speed rail====

JR Central and JR West operate high-speed trains on the Tōkaidō-Sanyō Shinkansen line. Shin-Ōsaka Station acts as the Shinkansen terminal station, though the two lines are physically joined, and many trains offer through service. This station is connected to Ōsaka Station at Umeda by the JR Kyoto Line and the subway Midōsuji Line. Shin-Osaka Station is the busiest high-speed station. The smaller stations of Kyoto Station, Shin-Kobe Station, Nishi-Akashi Station, Himeji Station, and Aioi Station also are within the Keihanshin area.

All trains on the two Shinkansen lines stop at Shin-Ōsaka Station and provide connections to other major cities in Japan. The Tokaido Shinkansen offers service to the east, stopping in such cities as Kyoto, Nagoya, Yokohama and Tokyo. From Tokyo connections can be made to other Shinkansen servicing areas north of Tokyo. The Sanyo Shinkansen offers service to the west, stopping in such cities as Kobe, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka. Through service is also offered to the Kyushu Shinkansen extending service to such cities as Kumamoto and Kagoshima.

There are also numerous Limited Express services which operate on conventional lines, but are designed for comfortable long-distance travel. Many of these trains operate at speeds that most other countries would consider &quot;high-speed&quot;. From Osaka and Kyoto, Limited Express services connect most major cities within the Keihanshin area and beyond, and are more popular than the Shinkansen for connections within the area due to service to more areas and more centrally located and well connected stations in areas also serviced by Shinkansen. Lower ticket prices also encourages usage, though they are more expensive than the regular/commuter trains which operate on the same lines.

==== Commuter rail====
Both JR West and private lines connect Keihanshin and its suburbs. The commuter rail network of JR West is called the Urban Network. Major stations on the JR Osaka Loop Line include Osaka (Umeda), Tennōji, Tsuruhashi, and Kyōbashi. JR West competes with such private rail operators as Keihan Electric Railway, Hankyu Railway, Hanshin Railway, Kintetsu Railway, and Nankai Electric Railway. The Keihan and Hankyu lines connect Osaka and Kyoto; the Hanshin and Hankyu lines connect Osaka and Kobe; the Kintetsu lines connect to Nara, Yoshino, Ise and Nagoya; and the Nankai lines connect to Osaka&#x27;s southern suburbs and Kansai International Airport as well as Wakayama and Mt. Koya. Many lines in Keihanshin accept either ICOCA or PiTaPa contactless smart cards for payment.

==== Municipal subway====

Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe each have municipal subway systems. The Osaka Municipal Subway was privatized in 2018 and is now operated by Osaka Metro.
Other rapid transit systems in the region include Kobe New Transit which serves the artificial islands off the coast of Kobe including Kobe Airport, as well as Osaka Monorail that connects municipalities in Osaka Prefecture to Osaka International Airport.

== Economy==
=== GDP (purchasing power parity) 2015 ===
Compared with other urban regions of the world, the agglomeration of Osaka-Kobe is the ninth largest economy, in terms of gross metropolitan product at purchasing power parity (PPP), in 2015 according to a study by the Brookings Institution.

<text>USS &quot;Montpelier&quot; (CL-57) was one of 27 United States Navy light cruisers completed during or shortly after World War II. She was the second US Navy ship to be named for the city of Montpelier, Vermont. &quot;Montpelier&quot; was commissioned in September 1942 and saw service in several campaigns in the Pacific. Like almost all her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and never saw active service again. &quot;Montpelier&quot; was scrapped in the early 1960s.

==Construction==
&quot;Montpelier&quot; was laid down on 2 December 1940 by New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey; launched on 12 February 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Lesley Sayer Corry, wife of William F. Corry, mayor of Montpelier, Vermont; and commissioned on 9 September 1942, Captain Leighton Wood in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
&quot;Montpelier&quot; arrived in Nouméa, New Caledonia on 18 January 1943 from Norfolk, Virginia Rear Admiral A. S. Merrill chose her for the flagship of Cruiser Division 12 (CruDiv 12). On 25 January, she reached Efate, New Hebrides, her home base for the next few months. While making a sweep around beleaguered Guadalcanal, she participated in the Battle of Rennell Island on 29 January, the last naval engagement of the Guadalcanal Campaign.

&quot;Montpelier&quot; covered the landings on the Russell Islands on 21 February. On the night of 5–6 March, she heavily bombarded the Vila‑Stanmore airfield on Kolombangara in the Solomons, and helped sink an enemy destroyer in the Battle of Blackett Strait. She and three other cruisers bombarded Poporang Island (in the Shortland Islands) on the night of 29–30 June, in preparation for the invasion of New Georgia. On the night of 11–12 July, she bombarded fortifications on Munda, enabling troops to continue their conquest of New Georgia. She patrolled the New Georgia area for the next four months to prevent Japanese troop withdrawals.

After a voyage to Sydney, Australia, she joined Task Force 39 (TF 39) as its flagship for the invasion of the Treasury and Bougainville Islands. On 1 November, &quot;Montpelier&quot; shelled the Buka‑Bonis airfields on the northern tip of Bougainville, and hit the Japanese defenses on the islands of Poporang and Balalae, in the Shortlands. TF 39, consisting of cruisers and destroyers, engaged a superior Japanese force in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay while guarding transports on the night of 2 November. The result was a victory for the U.S. ships commanded by Admiral Merrill. The victory turned back the Japanese from what would have been a disastrous assault on the Bougainville landing forces. Besides assisting in the destruction of one ship, &quot;Montpelier&quot;″s gunners shot down five enemy planes.

From 15–19 February 1944, &quot;Montpelier&quot; covered the amphibious landing on the Green Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago. In March, she hunted shipping south of Truk and participated in the invasion of the Emiraus. On 20 May 1944, &quot;Montpelier&quot; received light damage from return fire when she and two other light cruisers, along with eight destroyers, bombarded shore installations on Shortland, Poporang, and Magusaiai islands in the Shortlands. On 1 October 1944, the US Navy&#x27;s Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), and began shelling Saipan on 14 June to support the Mariana Islands invasion. She joined TF 58 and participated in the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea from 19–21 June. During the engagement, Japanese carrier air groups were virtually annihilated. &quot;Montpelier&quot; returned to the Marianas, and continued her shelling of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. She left the Marianas on 2 August for overhauling in the United States.

Returning on 25 November, she joined a task group off Leyte Gulf. While steaming on defensive patrol off the Gulf, &quot;Montpelier&quot; was slightly damaged by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 27 November. She fought off numerous other kamikaze attacks, shooting down four planes.

Beginning on 12 December, &quot;Montpelier&quot; provided beach cover for the invasion of Mindoro. Fighting &quot;kamikaze&quot;s, she protected troops at the Lingayen Gulf landing in January 1945. In February, she supported operations off Mariveles Harbor, Corregidor, and Palawan, and from 14–23 April, she covered the landings on Mindanao. From her base at Subic Bay, she steamed to Brunei Bay, Borneo, arriving on 9 June. From 17 June to 2 July, she sailed off the oil center at Balikpapan, providing support for minesweepers, underwater demolition teams, and amphibious forces. During the latter part of July and early August, &quot;Montpelier&quot; made three anti-shipping sweeps in the East China Sea as part of Task Force 95.

===Post-War===
When hostilities ended, she anchored off Wakayama, Japan, and helped accelerate the evacuation of Allied prisoners. After an inspection of Japanese ships, part of her crew went ashore to view the ruins of Hiroshima. On 18 October she covered the landing of occupation forces at Matsuyama. &quot;Montpelier&quot; departed from Hiro Wan and Japanese waters on 15 November for the East Coast, having battled the enemy from their deepest point of advance to their very homeland. From the Pacific, &quot;Montpelier&quot; sailed first for Hawaii, then to San Diego, California, before heading south to pass through the Panama Canal, with her final destination being New York City.

She reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet on 11 December, and on 1 July 1946 reported for duty with the 16th Fleet. &quot;Montpelier&quot; decommissioned and berthed in reserve at Philadelphia on 24 January 1947. She was struck from the Naval Register on 1 March 1959, and was sold for scrap to Bethlehem Steel Co. 22 January 1960.

==Awards==
&quot;Montpelier&quot; received 13 battle stars for World War II service, as well as the Navy Unit Commendation ribbon for outstanding heroism in action against enemy Japanese combatant ships on the night of 1–2 November 1943, the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, as a member of Cruiser Division Twelve.

==Coat of arms==
Depicted:
*The Green Mountains, principal topographical feature of Vermont, for whose capital &quot;Montpelier&quot; was named.
*A crowned eagle, replica of the crest of the Empress Augusta, wife of Germany&#x27;s William I, after which Empress Augusta Bay was named. &quot;Montpelier&quot;, as Flagship of Task Force 39, played the principal role in the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay.
*On fringe are coral cockershells, representative of the vast expanse of the Pacific, main theater in which &quot;Montpelier&quot; operated.

==Life on &quot;Montpelier&quot;==
Decades after the war, James J. Fahey (1918–1991), Seaman First Class, published &quot;Pacific War Diary: 1942 - 1945, The Secret Diary of an American Sailor&quot;. The diary provides a first person account of the experience of a sailor on &quot;Montpelier&quot; throughout the war, from its first cruise from port to its final journey home. In general, keeping a diary was against Navy regulations. Thus, Fahey offered a rare view of life on &quot;Montpelier&quot; and on wartime naval life as well.

<text>Edgar Nelson Rhodes, (January 5, 1877 – March 15, 1942), was a Canadian parliamentarian from Nova Scotia who served as Premier of Nova Scotia from 1925 to 1930.

==Early life and career==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1908 as a member of the Conservative Party. In January 1917, he became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada when his predecessor, Albert Sévigny, was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet. Rhodes was retained in the position following the 1917 election that fall, becoming the third Speaker since James Cockburn to preside over more than one Parliament. In 1921, he was made a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada before retiring from politics to become president of the British-American Nickel Company, whose previous president had been James Hamet Dunn.

==Premiership==
The company failed in 1925, and he returned to provincial politics. Prior to the 1925 provincial election, he was asked to become leader of the Nova Scotia Conservative Party after the leader of the party, W. L. Hall, was assaulted on the waterfront. Rhodes took over the party and led it to victory in the 1925 election. The Conservatives defeated a Liberal government that had been in power for forty-three years but had been, in its last years, wracked by an economic downturn and severe labour unrest among miners in Cape Breton.

Rhodes ran on a Maritime Rights platform, promising to curtail federal influence and stop the exodus of people from the province. The Tories more than doubled their seats in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, winning forty out of forty-three seats. An important factor in their victory was the failure of the governing Liberals to resolve a long strike by the province&#x27;s coal miners. When Cape Breton coal miner William Davis was killed by company police in a confrontation on June 11, voters looked to the Tories for solutions. Rhodes engineered a settlement of the dispute and appointed a royal commission. The new government later introduced pensions for teachers and allowances for widowed mothers.

During its first term, the government eliminated the requirement for newly-appointed ministers to run for re-election in 1927.

===Abolition of the Legislative Council===
The Legislative Council, the province&#x27;s appointed upper house, dated from 1838 and was meant to mimic the imperial House of Lords. It had, however, been the source of constant criticism from 1870, and every government since 1878 had promised or at least supported its abolition. The Council had been normally sized at 21 members prior to confederation, and the British North America Act 1867 provided for the continuation of provincial constitutions. Failing to further specify anything on such constitutions, the Act left doubt as to whether the Council was therefore limited to the customary 21 members, the 18 members actually empanelled at the time of the Act, or as many members as the Sovereign, however represented in Nova Scotia, wished. Further statutes of the provincial constitution continued this confusion. Similar equivocation existed as to whether appointments to the Council were for life or the mere pleasure of the Sovereign.

Partisan politics also played a role in this issue, with Liberals largely yielding to the Council&#x27;s presence as it was able to help the party organization and Tories opposing it for that reason. Liberal George Henry Murray, premier from 1896 to 1923, nominally supported its abolition but introduced only half-hearted measures to that end, and when money was ample enough to afford the second chamber he and the Liberal press largely supported its continuation. By 1923, the communist J. B. McLachlan stoked enough fear that the Council was able to position itself as the last barrier to his activities. Murray&#x27;s successor Armstrong reformed the Council by limiting future appointees to ten-year terms in 1925, but achieved little else.

By the time of Rhodes&#x27;s assumption of office, only one Conservative was on the Council. The new government declined to fill vacancies in the Council lest the new officeholders become too attached to its continued existence. It appointed F. P. Bligh to represent it in the Council in 1926, making him its President in 1927, and appointed R. H. Butts to be the government leader; those were the only two appointments of the government to the Council that were not for the express purpose of securing its abolition. Rhodes attempted to pay off the councillors in 1926, with ten-year pensions to those appointed for life and five-year pensions to those appointed for ten years, but the offer was rejected. After this failure, Rhodes advised the Lieutenant-Governor James Cranswick Tory to appoint enough Councillors to vote the body out of existence, arguing that the Sovereign, duly represented by the Lieutenant-Governor in Nova Scotia, continued to have the right to appoint an unlimited number of persons to the Council. Tory referred the matter to the federal Governor General in Council, who told him to limit the appointments to 21 total councillors pending further judicial review.

After this second setback, the government introduced a bill in 1926, and another in 1927, to abolish the Council; unlikely to pass, they were to absolve the government of any blame for the Council&#x27;s continued existence. After these setbacks, and considering taking the issue to a provincial referendum, the government ultimately appealed to the imperial Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, where it won a total victory; not only was the Sovereign, and by extension the Lieutenant Governor in Council, able to appoint as many Legislative Councillors as desired, but also that such councillors served at pleasure if appointed prior to the 1925 statute. Now at the mercy of Rhodes after having ironically declined a written constitution, the Council offered its abolition but Rhodes declined. The Council had at this point 17 members; six of them were appointed under the 1925 statute and were thus immune from the executive, whereas two were Conservatives, A. W. Redden and W. H. Owen, who were allowed to keep their seats despite Owen&#x27;s lack of a formal pledge to support abolition. The remaining nine were Liberals who, despite their pledged support for abolition were ordered to resign or face dismissal; three resigned and six were dismissed.

The government appointed 14 new Tories, bringing the Council to 22 for the first time; in addition to the symbolism, this number allowed every county to take part of the abolition. Lest any appointees go rogue and become attached to their legislative role, the government ensured that very little legislative work would happen in 1928, whose session was primarily occupied by partying and feasting. Bligh gave the farewell speech, ending it with &quot;sic transitur gloria mundi&quot;, which was drowned out by the revelry. The councillors adopted the motto of &quot;let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die&quot; for their final day in office.

===Second term===
The Rhodes government was re-elected in 1928 with a reduced majority.

Having criticized prohibition in 1927, Rhodes scheduled a referendum on the topic for October 31, 1929. The referendum resulted in the discontinuance of outright prohibition in favour of government control of liquor sales.

John Francis Mahoney, the Minister for Natural Resources, died in a car accident on September 2, 1929. After that point, the government&#x27;s majority was only two, and Rhodes opened a by-election in December to confirm the placement of George H. Murphy, Mahoney&#x27;s successor as minister, in the seat that Mahoney had been narrowly elected to in the general election. Rhodes took the by-election as a referendum on his government&#x27;s mandate, and had waited until December to drop the writ to capitalize on the success of the referendum and internal division in the Liberal leadership.

Murphy won the election, which happened on January 21, with a sizeable majority. Rhodes thus had the necessary confidence to retain office until the government&#x27;s term expired in 1933. However, he himself would not be premier for that duration, as the Conservatives would regain federal office in August and have the new prime minister R. B. Bennett appoint him to be the new Minister of Fisheries at Ottawa. Rhodes chose Gordon Sidney Harrington as his successor at Halifax.

==Federal government==
He returned to federal politics to become Minister of Fisheries under Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. From 1932 to 1935, he served as federal Finance Minister, and, despite the Great Depression, handed down austere budgets that increased taxes and reduced spending.

==Senate and later life==
He was appointed to the Senate of Canada three months before the 1935 federal election that routed Bennett&#x27;s government. He remained a Senator until his death in 1942 in Ottawa. He is buried in Ottawa&#x27;s Beechwood Cemetery.

On July 12, 1905, he married Mary Grace Pipes, daughter of William Thomas Pipes, Rhodes&#x27; law partner and Premier of Nova Scotia from 1882 to 1884. They had one son, Edgar Nelson, and one daughter, Helen Sybil.

<doc id="557407" wikidata="Q1280410" url="?curid=557407" title="Japanese martial arts">
<text>Japanese martial arts refers to the variety of martial arts native to the country of Japan. At least three Japanese terms (&quot;budō&quot;, &quot;bujutsu&quot;, and &quot;bugei&quot;) are used interchangeably with the English phrase Japanese martial arts.

The usage of the term budō (武道) to mean martial arts is a modern one: historically the term meant a way of life encompassing physical, spiritual and moral dimensions with a focus on self-improvement, fulfillment or personal growth. The terms &quot;bujutsu&quot; (武術) and &quot;bugei&quot; (武芸) have different meanings from &quot;budō&quot;, at least historically speaking. &quot;Bujutsu&quot; refers specifically to the practical application of martial tactics and techniques in actual combat. &quot;Bugei&quot; refers to the adaptation or refinement of those tactics and techniques to facilitate systematic instruction and dissemination within a formal learning environment.

== History ==


Each child who grew up in a samurai family was expected to be a warrior when he grew up, so much of his childhood was spent practicing different martial arts. A complete samurai should be skilled at least in the use of the sword (&quot;kenjutsu&quot;), the bow and arrow (&quot;kyujutsu&quot;), the spear (&quot;sojutsu&quot;, &quot;yarijutsu&quot;), the halberd (&quot;naginatajutsu&quot;) and subsequently the use of firearms (houjutsu). Similarly, they were instructed in the use of these weapons while riding a horse. They were also expected to know how to swim and dive.

 originates from the Sengoku period in the 15th century. The samurai developed , which was useful in case they were thrown overboard during naval conflicts. The samurai practiced , and to board enemy vessels. Activities included strokes with swords, bows and firearms. Hands were kept dry above the water to write messages with an ink brush on a paper scroll. This skill was useful for muskets which require dry gunpowder. Nihon Eiho is practiced by 28 schools and recognized by the Japan Swimming Federation.

During the feudal era of Japan, various types of martial arts flourished, known in Japanese under the name of . The term &quot;jutsu&quot; can be translated as &quot;method&quot;, &quot;art&quot; or &quot;technique&quot; and the name that each one has is indicative of the mode or weapon with which they are executed. The combat methods that were developed and perfected are very diverse, among which are:

Ordinarily, the development of combative techniques is intertwined with the tools used to execute those techniques. In a rapidly changing world, those tools are constantly changing, requiring that the techniques to use them be continuously reinvented. The history of Japan is somewhat unusual in its relative isolation. Compared with the rest of the world, the Japanese tools of war evolved slowly. Many people believe that this afforded the warrior class the opportunity to study their weapons in greater depth than other cultures. Nevertheless, the teaching and training of these martial arts did evolve. For example, in the early medieval period, the bow and the spear were emphasized, but during the Tokugawa period (1603–1867 CE), fewer large-scale battles took place, and the sword became the most prestigious weapon. Another trend that developed throughout Japanese history was that of increasing martial specialization as society became more stratified over time.

The martial arts developed or originating in Japan are extraordinarily diverse, with vast differences in training tools, methods, and philosophy across innumerable schools and styles. That said, Japanese martial arts may generally be divided into &quot;koryū&quot; and &quot;gendai budō&quot; based on whether they existed prior to or after the Meiji Restoration (1868), respectively. Since &quot;gendai budō&quot; and &quot;koryū&quot; often share the same historical origin, one will find various types of martial arts (such as jujutsu, kenjutsu, or naginatajutsu) on both sides of the divide.

:A note on the organization of this article; it would be impossible to discuss Japanese martial arts in terms of the thousands of individual schools or styles, such as &quot;Ittō-ryū&quot;, &quot;Daitō-ryū&quot;, or &quot;Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū&quot;. Instead, major sections are divided based on when the art originated (regardless of whether it is still practiced), and subsections are dedicated to the root type of martial art, such as jujutsu (the art of empty-handed combat through use of indirect application of force) or kendo (Japanese sport fencing), wherein notable styles or major differences between styles may be discussed.

== Koryū ==

, meaning &quot;traditional school&quot;, or &quot;old school&quot;, refers specifically to schools of martial arts, originating in Japan, either prior to the beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, or the &quot;Haitōrei&quot; (Sword Abolishment Edict) in 1876. In modern usage, , meaning military art/science, is typified by its practical application of technique to real-world or battlefield situations.

The term also is used generally to indicate that a particular style or art is &quot;traditional&quot;, rather than &quot;modern&quot;. However, what it means for an art to be either &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;modern&quot; is subject to some debate. As a rule of thumb, the primary purpose of a &quot;koryū&quot; martial art was for use in war. The most extreme example of a &quot;koryū&quot; school is one that preserves its traditional, and often ancient, martial practices even in the absence of continuing wars in which to test them. Other &quot;koryū&quot; schools may have made modifications to their practices that reflect the passage of time (which may or may not have resulted in the loss of &quot;koryū&quot; status in the eyes of its peers). This is as opposed to &quot;modern&quot; martial arts, whose primary focus is generally upon the self-improvement (mental, physical, or spiritual) of the individual practitioner, with varying degrees of emphasis on the practical application of the martial art for either sport or self-defence purposes.

The following subsections represent not individual schools of martial arts, but rather generic &quot;types&quot; of martial arts. These are generally distinguishable on the basis of their training methodology and equipment, though wide variation still exists within each.

=== Sumō ===
, considered by many to be Japan&#x27;s national sport, has its origins in the distant past. The earliest written records of Japan, which are dated from the 8th century AD, record the first sumo match in 23 BC, occurring specifically at the request of the emperor and continuing until one man was too wounded to continue. Beginning in 728 AD, the Emperor Shōmu (聖武天皇, 701–756) began holding official sumo matches at the annual harvest festivals. This tradition of having matches in the presence of the emperor continued, but gradually spread, with matches also held at Shintō festivals, and sumo training was eventually incorporated into military training. By the 17th century, sumo was an organized professional sport, open to the public, enjoyed by both the upper class and commoners.

Today, sumo retains much of its traditional trappings, including a referee dressed as a Shintō priest, and a ritual where the competitors clap hands, stomp their feet, and throw salt in the ring prior to each match. To win a match, competitors employ throwing and grappling techniques to force the other man to the ground; the first man to touch the ground with a part of the body other than the bottom of the feet, or touch the ground outside the ring with any part of the body, loses. Six grand tournaments are held annually in Japan, and each professional fighter&#x27;s name and relative ranking is published after each tournament in an official list, called the &quot;banzuke&quot;, which is followed religiously by sumo fans.

=== Jūjutsu ===


, literally translates to &quot;soft skills&quot;. However, more accurately, it means the art of using indirect force, such as joint locks or throwing techniques, to defeat an opponent, as opposed to direct force such as a punch or a kick. This is not to imply that jujutsu does not teach or employ strikes, but rather that the art&#x27;s aim is the ability to use an attacker&#x27;s force against him or her, and counter-attack where they are weakest or least defended.

Methods of combat included striking (kicking, punching), throwing (body throws, joint-lock throws, unbalance throws), restraining (pinning, strangulating, grappling, wrestling) and weaponry. Defensive tactics included blocking, evading, off balancing, blending and escaping. Minor weapons such as the &quot;tantō&quot; (短刀; dagger), &quot;ryufundo kusari&quot; (weighted chain), &quot;jutte&quot; (十手; helmet-smasher), and &quot;kakushi buki&quot; (隠武器; secret or disguised weapons) were almost always included in &quot;koryū&quot; jujutsu.

Most of these were battlefield-based systems to be practiced as companion arts to the more common and vital weapon systems. At the time, these fighting arts went by many different names, including &quot;kogusoku&quot;, &quot;yawara&quot;, &quot;kumiuchi&quot;, and &quot;hakuda&quot;. In reality, these grappling systems were not really unarmed systems of combat, but are more accurately described as means whereby an unarmed or lightly armed warrior could defeat a heavily armed and armored enemy on the battlefield. Ideally, the samurai would be armed and would not need to rely on such techniques.

In later times, other &quot;koryū&quot; developed into systems more familiar to the practitioners of the jujutsu commonly seen today. These systems are generally designed to deal with opponents neither wearing armor nor in a battlefield environment. For this reason, they include extensive use of &quot;atemi waza&quot; (当て身技; vital-striking technique). These tactics would be of little use against an armored opponent on a battlefield. They would, however, be quite valuable to anyone confronting an enemy or opponent during peacetime dressed in normal street attire. Occasionally, inconspicuous weapons such as knives or &quot;tessen&quot; (鉄扇; iron fans) were included in the curriculum.

Today, jujutsu is practiced in many forms, both ancient and modern. Various methods of jujutsu have been incorporated or synthesized into judo and aikido, as well as being exported throughout the world and transformed into sport wrestling systems, adopted in whole or part by schools of karate or other unrelated martial arts, still practiced as they were centuries ago, or all of the above.

=== Swordsmanship ===


Swordsmanship, the art of the sword, has an almost mythological ethos, and is believed by some to be the paramount martial art, surpassing all others. Regardless of the truth of that belief, the sword itself has been the subject of stories and legends through virtually all cultures in which it has been employed as a tool for violence. In Japan, the use of the katana is no different. Although originally the most important skills of the warrior class were proficiency at horse-riding and shooting the bow, this eventually gave way to swordsmanship. The earliest swords, which can be dated as far back as the Kofun era (3rd and 4th centuries) were primarily straight bladed. According to legend, curved swords made strong by the famous folding process were first forged by the smith Amakuni Yasutsuna (天國 安綱, c. 700 AD).

The primary development of the sword occurred between 987 AD and 1597 AD. This development is characterized by profound artistry during peaceful eras, and renewed focus on durability, utility, and mass production during the intermittent periods of warfare, most notably civil warfare during the 12th century and the Mongolian invasions during the 13th century (which in particular saw the transition from mostly horseback archery to hand-to-hand ground fighting).

This development of the sword is paralleled by the development of the methods used to wield it. During times of peace, the warriors trained with the sword, and invented new ways to implement it. During war, these theories were tested. After the war ended, those who survived examined what worked and what didn&#x27;t, and passed their knowledge on. In 1600 AD, Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川 家康, 1543–1616) gained total control of all of Japan, and the country entered a period of prolonged peace that would last until the Meiji Restoration. During this period, the techniques to use the sword underwent a transition from a primarily utilitarian art for killing, to one encompassing a philosophy of personal development and spiritual perfection.

The terminology used in Japanese swordsmanship is somewhat ambiguous. Many names have been used for various aspects of the art or to encompass the art as a whole.

==== Kenjutsu ====
 literally means &quot;the art/science of the sword&quot;. Although the term has been used as a general term for swordsmanship as a whole, in modern times, &quot;kenjutsu&quot; refers more to the specific aspect of swordsmanship dealing with partnered sword training. It is the oldest form of training and, at its simplest level, consists of two partners with swords drawn, practicing combat drills. Historically practiced with wooden katana (&quot;bokken&quot;; 木剣), this most often consists of pre-determined forms, called &quot;kata&quot; (型), or sometimes called &quot;kumitachi&quot; (組太刀), and similar to the partner drills practiced in kendo. Among advanced students, &quot;kenjutsu&quot; training may also include increasing degrees of freestyle practice.

==== Battōjutsu ====
, literally meaning &quot;the art/science of drawing a sword&quot;, and developed in the mid-15th century, is the aspect of swordsmanship focused upon the efficient draw of the sword, cutting down one&#x27;s enemy, and returning the sword to its scabbard (&quot;saya&quot;; 鞘). The term came into use specifically during the Warring States Period (15th–17th centuries). Closely related to, but predating &quot;iaijutsu&quot;, &quot;battōjutsu&quot; training emphasizes defensive counter-attacking. &quot;Battōjutsu&quot; training technically incorporates &quot;kata&quot;, but generally consist of only a few moves, focusing on stepping up to an enemy, drawing, performing one or more cuts, and sheathing the weapon. &quot;Battōjutsu&quot; exercises tend to lack the elaborateness, as well as the aesthetic considerations of &quot;iaijutsu&quot; or &quot;iaidō&quot; &quot;kata&quot;. Finally, note that use of the name alone is not dispositive; what is &quot;battōjutsu&quot; to one school may be &quot;iaijutsu&quot; to another.

==== Iaijutsu ====
, approximately &quot;the art/science of mental presence and immediate reaction&quot;, is also the Japanese art of drawing the sword. However, unlike &quot;battōjutsu&quot;, &quot;iaijutsu&quot; tends to be technically more complex, and there is a much stronger focus upon perfecting form. The primary technical aspects are smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard, striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.

=== Naginatajutsu ===


 is the Japanese art of wielding the &quot;naginata&quot;, a weapon resembling the medieval European glaive or guisarme. Most &quot;naginata&quot; practice today is in a modernized form (&quot;gendai budō&quot;) called the &quot;way of naginata&quot; (&quot;naginata-dō&quot;) or &quot;new naginata&quot; (&quot;atarashii naginata&quot;), in which competitions are also held.

However, many koryu maintain naginatajutsu in their curriculum. Also of note, during the late Edo period, naginata were used to train women and ladies in waiting. Thus, most naginatajutsu styles are headed by women and most naginata practitioners in Japan are women. This has led to the impression overseas that naginatajutsu is a martial art that was not used by male warriors. In fact, naginatajutsu was developed in early medieval Japan and for a time was widely used by samurai.

=== Sōjutsu ===
 is the Japanese art of fighting with the spear (&quot;yari&quot;). For most of Japan&#x27;s history, &quot;sōjutsu&quot; was practiced extensively by traditional schools. In times of war, it was a primary skill of many soldiers. Today it is a minor art taught in very few schools.

=== Shinobi no jutsu ===
&quot;Shinobi no jutsu&quot; (aka &quot;Ninjutsu&quot;) was developed by groups of people mainly from Iga, Mie and Kōka, Shiga of Japan who became noted for their skills as infiltrators, scouts, secret agents, and spies. The training of these &quot;shinobi&quot; (忍; &quot;ninja&quot;) involves
espionage, sabotage, disguise, escape, , assassination, archery, medicine, explosives, poisons, and more.

=== Other koryū martial arts ===
The early martial art schools of Japan were almost entirely &quot;Sōgō bujutsu&quot;, composite martial systems made up of an eclectic collection of skills and tools. With the long peace of the Tokugawa shogunate there was an increase in specialization with many schools identifying themselves with particular major battlefield weapons. However, there were many additional weapons employed by the warriors of feudal Japan, and an art to wielding each. Usually they were studied as secondary or tertiary weapons within a school but there are exceptions, such as the art of wielding the short staff, (&quot;jōdō&quot;; 杖道) which was the primary art taught by the Shintō Musō-ryū.

Other arts existed to teach military skills other than the use of weaponry. Examples of these include marine skills such as swimming and river-fording (&quot;suijutsu&quot;; 水術), equestrianism (&quot;bajutsu&quot;; 馬術), arson and demolition (&quot;kajutsu&quot;).

== Gendai budō ==
, literally meaning &quot;modern martial way&quot;, usually applies to arts founded after the beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Aikido and judo are examples of &quot;gendai budō&quot; that were founded in the modern era, while &quot;iaidō&quot; represents the modernization of a practice that has existed for centuries.

The core difference is, as was explained under &quot;koryū&quot;, above, that &quot;koryū&quot; arts are practiced as they were when their primary utility was for use in warfare, while the primary purpose of &quot;gendai budō&quot; is for self-improvement, with self-defense as a secondary purpose. Additionally, many of the &quot;gendai budō&quot; have included a sporting element to them. Judo and kendo are both examples of this.

=== Judo ===


, literally meaning &quot;gentle way&quot; or &quot;way of softness&quot;, is a grappling-based martial art, practiced primarily as a sport. It contains substantially the same emphasis on the personal, spiritual, and physical self-improvement of its practitioners as can be found throughout &quot;gendai budō&quot;.

Judo was created by Kano Jigoro (嘉納 治五郎 &quot;Kanō Jigorō&quot;, 1860–1938) at the end of the 19th century. Kano took the &quot;koryū&quot; martial arts he learned (specifically Kitō-ryū and Tenjin Shin&#x27;yo-ryū jujutsu), and systematically reinvented them into a martial art with an emphasis on freestyle practice (randori) and competition, while removing harmful jujutsu techniques or limiting them to the kata. Kano devised a powerful system of new techniques and training methods, which famously culminated on June 11, 1886, in a tournament that would later be dramatized by celebrated Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa (黒沢 明 &quot;Kurosawa Akira&quot;, 1910–1998), in the film &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot; (1943).

Judo became an Olympic sport in 1964, and has spread throughout the world. Kano Jigoro&#x27;s original school, the &quot;Kodokan&quot;, has students worldwide, and many other schools have been founded by Kano&#x27;s students.

=== Kendo ===


, meaning the &quot;way of the sword&quot;, is based on Japanese sword-fighting. It is an evolution of the art of &quot;kenjutsu&quot;, and its exercises and practice are descended from several particular schools of swordsmanship. The primary technical influence in its development was the &quot;kenjutsu&quot; school of Ittō-ryū (founded c. 16th century), whose core philosophy revolved around the concept that all strikes in swordsmanship revolve around the technique &quot;kiri-oroshi&quot; (vertical downward cut). Kendo really began to take shape with the introduction of bamboo swords, called &quot;shinai&quot; (竹刀), and the set of lightweight wooden armour, called &quot;bōgu&quot; (防具), by Naganuma Sirōzaemon Kunisato (長沼 四郎左衛門 国郷, 1688–1767), which allowed for the practice of strikes at full speed and power without risk of injury to the competitors.

Today, virtually the entire practice of kendo is governed by the All Japan Kendo Federation, founded in 1951. Competitions are judged by points, with the first competitor to score two points on their opponent declared the winner. One point may be scored with a successful and properly executed strike to any of several targets: a thrust to the throat, or a strike to the top of the head, sides of the head, sides of the body, or forearms. Practitioners also compete in forms (&quot;kata&quot;) competitions, using either wooden or blunted metal swords, according to a set of forms promulgated by the AJKF.

=== Iaidō ===
, which would be &quot;the way of mental presence and immediate reaction&quot;, is nominally the modernization of &quot;iaijutsu&quot;, but in practice is frequently identical to &quot;iaijutsu&quot;. The replacement of &quot;jutsu&quot; (術) with &quot;dō&quot; (道) is part of the 20th century emphasis upon personal and spiritual development; an evolution that took place in many martial arts. In the case of &quot;iaidō&quot;, some schools merely changed in name without altering the curriculum, and others embraced the wholesale change from a combat-orientation to spiritual growth. Similar to Kendō, Iaidō is largely practiced under the All Japan Kendo Federation and it&#x27;s not unusual for a Kendō club to offer Iaidō practice as well.

=== Aikido ===


 means &quot;the way to harmony with ki&quot;. It is a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba (植芝 盛平 &quot;Ueshiba Morihei&quot;, 1883 – 1969). The art consists of &quot;striking&quot;, &quot;throwing&quot; and &quot;joint locking&quot; techniques and is known for its fluidity and blending with an attacker, rather than meeting &quot;force with force&quot;. Emphasis is upon joining with the rhythm and intent of the opponent in order to find the optimal position and timing, when the opponent can be led without force. Aikidō is also known for emphasizing the personal development of its students, reflecting the spiritual background of its founder.

Morihei Ueshiba developed aikido mainly from Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu incorporating training movements such as those for the &quot;yari&quot; (槍; spear), &quot;jō&quot; (杖; a short quarterstaff), and perhaps also &quot;jūken&quot; (銃剣; bayonet). Arguably the strongest influence is that of &quot;kenjutsu&quot; and in many ways, an aikidō practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman.

=== Kyūdō ===

, which means &quot;way of the bow&quot;, is the modern name for Japanese archery. Originally in Japan, kyujutsu, the &quot;art of the bow&quot;, was a discipline of the samurai, the Japanese warrior class. The bow is a long range weapon that allowed a military unit to engage an opposing force while it was still far away. If the archers were mounted on horseback, they could be used to even more devastating effect as a mobile weapons platform. Archers were also used in sieges and sea battles.

However, from the 16th century onward, firearms slowly displaced the bow as the dominant battlefield weapon. As the bow lost its significance as a weapon of war, and under the influence of Buddhism, Shinto, Daoism and Confucianism, Japanese archery evolved into kyudō, the &quot;way of the bow&quot;. In some schools kyudō is practiced as a highly refined contemplative practice, while in other schools it is practiced as a sport.

=== Karate ===
 literally means &quot;empty hand&quot;. It is also sometimes called . It was originally called 唐手 (&quot;Chinese hand&quot;), also pronounced &#x27;karate&#x27;.

Karate originated in and, is technically, Okinawan, except for Kyokushin (an amalgamation of parts of Shotokan and Gojoryu), formerly known as the Ryūkyū Kingdom, but now a part of present-day Japan. Karate is a fusion of pre-existing Okinawan martial arts, called &quot;te&quot;, and Chinese martial arts. It is an art that has been adopted and developed by practitioners on the Japanese main island of Honshu.

Karate&#x27;s route to Honshu began with Gichin Funakoshi (船越 義珍 &quot;Funakoshi Gichin&quot;, 1868–1957), who is called the father of karate, and is the founder of Shotokan karate. Although some Okinawan karate practitioners were already living and teaching in Honshū, Funakoshi gave public demonstrations of karate in Tokyo at a physical education exhibition sponsored by the ministry of education in 1917, and again in 1922. As a result, karate training was subsequently incorporated into Japan&#x27;s public school system. It was also at this time that the white uniforms and the &quot;kyū&quot;/&quot;dan&quot; ranking system (both originally implemented by judo&#x27;s founder, Kano Jigoro) were adopted.

Karate practice is primarily characterized by linear punching and kicking techniques executed from a stable, fixed stance. Many styles of karate practiced today incorporate the forms (&quot;kata&quot;) originally developed by Funakoshi and his teachers and many different weapons traditionally concealed as farm implements by the peasants of Okinawa. Many karate practitioners also participate in light- and no-contact competitions while some (ex. kyokushin karate) still compete in full-contact competitions with little or no protective gear.

=== Shorinji Kempo ===
 is a post-World War II system of self-defense and self-improvement training (行: &quot;gyo&quot; or discipline) known as the modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu. There are two primary technique categories such as &quot;gōhō&quot; (剛法; strikes, kicks and blocks) and &quot;jūhō&quot; (柔法; pins, joint locks and dodges). It was established in 1947 by who had been in Manchuria during World War II and who on returning to his native Japan after World War II saw the need to overcome the devastation and re-build self-confidence of the Japanese people on a massive scale. 
Although Shorinji Kempo was originally introduced in Japan in the late 1940s and 1950s through large scale programmes involving employees of major national organizations (e.g. Japan Railways) it subsequently became popular in many other countries. Today, according to the World Shorinji Kempo Organization (WSKO), there are almost 1.5 million practitioners in 33 countries.

== Philosophical and strategic concepts ==

=== Aiki ===
The principle of is particularly difficult to describe or explain. The most simple translation of &quot;aiki&quot;, as &quot;joining energy&quot;, belies its philosophical depth. Generally, it is the principle of matching your opponent in order to defeat him. It is this concept of &quot;matching&quot;, or &quot;joining&quot;, or even &quot;harmonizing&quot; (all valid interpretations of &quot;ai&quot;) that contains the complexity. One may &quot;match&quot; the opponent in a clash of force, possibly even resulting in a mutual kill. This is not &quot;aiki&quot;. &quot;Aiki&quot; is epitomized by the notion of joining physically and mentally with the opponent for the express purpose of avoiding a direct clash of force. In practice, &quot;aiki&quot; is achieved by first joining with the motion of the opponent (the physical aspect) as well as the intent (the mental portion), then overcoming the will of the opponent, redirecting their motion and intent.

Historically, this principle was used for destructive purposes; to seize an advantage and kill one&#x27;s opponent. The modern art of aikido is founded upon the principle that the control of the opponent achieved by the successful application of &quot;aiki&quot; may be used to defeat one&#x27;s opponent without harming them.

=== Attitude ===
&quot;Kokoro&quot; (心:こころ) is a concept that crosses through many martial arts, but has no single discrete meaning. Literally translating as &quot;heart&quot;, in context it can also mean &quot;character&quot; or &quot;attitude.&quot; Character is a central concept in karate, and in keeping with the &quot;dō&quot; nature of modern karate, there is a great emphasis on improving oneself. It is often said that the art of karate is for self-defense; not injuring one&#x27;s opponent is the highest expression of the art. Some popularly repeated quotes implicating this concept include:

The ultimate aim of Karate lies not in victory or defeat, but in the perfection of the character of its participants.
:—Gichin Funakoshi

=== Budō ===
A Japanese term for martial art, literally &quot;martial way&quot;.

=== Bushidō ===
A code of honor for samurai way of life, in principle similar to chivalry but culturally very different. Literally &quot;the way of the warrior&quot;, those dedicated to Bushido have exemplary skill with a sword or bow, and can withstand great pain and discomfort. It emphasizes courage, bravery, and loyalty to their lord (daimyō) above all.

=== Courtesy ===
Shigeru Egami:

Words that I have often heard are that &quot;everything begins with &quot;rei&quot; and ends with &quot;rei&quot;&quot;. The word itself, however, can be interpreted in several ways; it is the &quot;rei&quot; of &quot;reigi&quot; meaning &quot;etiquette, courtesy, politeness&quot; and it is also the &quot;rei&quot; of &quot;keirei&quot;, &quot;salutation&quot; or &quot;bow&quot;. The meaning of &quot;rei&quot; is sometimes explained in terms of &quot;kata&quot; or &quot;katachi&quot; (&quot;formal exercises&quot; and &quot;form&quot; or &quot;shape&quot;). It is of prime importance not only in karate but in all modern martial arts. For the purpose in modern martial arts, let us understand &quot;rei&quot; as the ceremonial bow in which courtesy and decorum are manifest.

He who would follow the way of karate must be courteous, not only in training but in daily life. While humble and gentle, he should never be servile. His performance of the kata should reflect boldness and confidence. This seemingly paradoxical combination of boldness and gentleness leads ultimately to harmony. It is true, as Master Funakoshi used to say, that the spirit of karate would be lost without courtesy.

=== Kiai ===
A term describing &#x27;fighting spirit&#x27;. In practical use this often refers to the scream or shout made during an attack, used for proper breathing as well as debilitating or distracting the enemy.

=== Hard and soft methods ===

There are two underlying strategic methodologies to the application of force in Japanese martial arts. One is the , and the other is the . Implicit in these concepts is their separate but equal and interrelated nature, in keeping with their philosophical relationship to the Chinese principles of yin and yang (Jp.: &quot;in&quot; and &quot;yō&quot;).

The hard method is characterized by the direct application of counter-force to an opposing force. In practice, this may be a direct attack, consisting of movement directly towards the opponent, coinciding with a strike towards the opponent. A defensive technique where the defender stands their ground to block or parry (directly opposing the attack by stopping it or knocking it aside) would be an example of a hard method of defense. Hard method techniques are generally conceptualized as being linear.

The soft method is characterized by the indirect application of force, which either avoids or redirects the opposing force. For example, receiving an attack by slipping past it, followed by adding force to the attacker&#x27;s limb for the purpose of unbalancing an attacker is an example of soft method. Soft method techniques are generally conceptualized as being circular.

These definitions give rise to the often illusory distinction between &quot;hard-style&quot; and &quot;soft-style&quot; martial arts. In truth, most styles technically practice both, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner&#x27;s skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole.

=== Openings, initiative and timing ===
Openings, initiative, and timing are deeply interrelated concepts applicable to self-defense and competitive combat. They each denote different considerations relevant to successfully initiating or countering an attack.

 are the foundation of a successful attack. Although possible to successfully injure an opponent who is ready to receive an attack, it is obviously preferable to attack when and where one&#x27;s opponent is open. What it means to be open may be as blatant as an opponent becoming tired and lowering their guard (as in physically lowering their hands), or as subtle as a momentary lapse in concentration. In the classical form of combat between masters, each would stand almost entirely motionless until the slightest opening was spotted; only then would they launch as devastating an attack as they could muster, with the goal of incapacitating their opponent with a single blow.

In Japanese martial arts, is &quot;the decisive moment when a killing action is initiated.&quot; There are two types of initiative in Japanese martial arts, , and . Each type of initiative complements the other, and has different advantages and weaknesses. Early initiative is the taking advantage of an opening in an opponent&#x27;s guard or concentration (&quot;see &quot;suki&quot;, supra&quot;). To fully take the early initiative, the attack launched must be with total commitment and lacking in any hesitation, and virtually ignoring the possibility of a counter-attack by the opponent. Late initiative involves an active attempt to induce an attack by the opponent that will create a weakness in the opponent&#x27;s defenses, often by faking an opening that is too enticing for the opponent to pass up.

All of the above concepts are integrated into the idea of the combat . &quot;Maai&quot; is a complex concept, incorporating not just the distance between opponents, but also the time it will take to cross the distance, and angle and rhythm of attack. It is specifically the exact &quot;position&quot; from which one opponent can strike the other, after factoring in the above elements. For example, a faster opponent&#x27;s &quot;maai&quot; is farther away than a slower opponent. It is ideal for one opponent to maintain &quot;maai&quot; while preventing the other from doing so.

The Three Attacks

* &quot;Go no sen&quot;: meaning &quot;late attack&quot; involves a defensive or counter movement in response to an attack.
* &quot;Sen no sen&quot;: a defensive initiative launched simultaneously with the attack of the opponent.
* &quot;Sensen no sen&quot;: an initiative launched in anticipation of an attack where the opponent is fully committed to their attack and thus psychologically beyond the point of no return.
=== Shuhari ===
The principle of Shuhari describes the three stages of learning.

=== States of mind: empty, immovable, remaining, and beginner&#x27;s ===
== Pedagogy ==

=== Schools ===
Literally meaning &quot;flow&quot; in Japanese, a ryū is a particular school of an art.

=== Instructors ===
 is the title used for a teacher, in a similar manner to a college &#x27;Professor&#x27; in the United States. translates as &quot;headmaster&quot; meaning the head of a &quot;ryu&quot;.

=== Seniors and juniors ===
The relationship between and is one with its origins not in martial arts, but rather in Japanese and Asian culture generally. It underlies Japanese interpersonal relationships in many contexts, such as business, school, and sports. It has become part of the teaching process in Japanese martial arts schools. A senior student is senior to all students who either began training after him or her, or who they outrank. The role of the senior student is crucial to the indoctrination of the junior students to etiquette, work ethic, and other virtues important to the school. The junior student is expected to treat their seniors with respect, and plays an important role in giving the senior students the opportunity to learn leadership skills. Senior students may or may not teach formal classes, but in every respect their role is as a teacher to the junior students, by example and by providing encouragement.

=== Ranking systems ===
There are ultimately two ranking systems in the Japanese martial arts, although some schools have been known to blend these two together. The older system, usual prior to 1868, was based a series of licenses or &quot;menkyo&quot;. There were generally very few levels culminating in the license of total transmission (&quot;menkyo kaiden&quot;; 免許皆伝).

In the modern system, first introduced in the martial arts through judo, students progress by promotion through a series of grades (kyū), followed by a series of degrees (dan), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some arts use only white and black belts to distinguish between levels, while others use a progression of colored belts for kyū levels.

=== Forms ===
It has often been said that forms (&quot;kata&quot;) are the backbone of the martial arts. Nevertheless, different schools and styles put a varying amount of emphasis upon their practice.

<doc id="557409" wikidata="Q326403" url="?curid=557409" title="Gottfried von Strassburg">
<text>Gottfried von Strassburg (died c. 1210) is the author of the Middle High German courtly romance &quot;Tristan&quot;, an adaptation of the 12th-century &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; legend. Gottfried&#x27;s work is regarded, alongside the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; and Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;, as one of the great narrative masterpieces of the German Middle Ages. He is probably also the composer of a small number of surviving lyrics. His work became a source of inspiration for Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (1865).

==Life==
Other than an origin in or close association with Strasbourg, nothing is known of his life. It would seem, however, that he was a man of good birth and position, who filled an important municipal office in his native city of Strasbourg, but since he is always referred to in German as &quot;Meister&quot; (master) and not &quot;Herr&quot; (sir), it seems safe to assume he was not a knight, a conclusion supported by the rather dismissive attitude toward knightly exploits shown in &quot;Tristan&quot;.

&quot;Tristan&quot; ends abruptly, and according to the testimony of Ulrich von Türheim and Heinrich von Freiberg, two people who provided endings for &quot;Tristan&quot;, Gottfried died before finishing the work. References in the work suggest it was written during the first decade of the 13th century, and 1210 is taken, conventionally, as the date of Gottfried&#x27;s death.

His thorough familiarity with Latin literature and rhetorical theory suggest someone who had enjoyed a high level of monastic education. He also shows detailed technical knowledge of music and hunting, far beyond anything found in the works of his contemporaries. Gottfried draws more on the learned tradition of medieval humanism than on the chivalric ethos shared by his major literary contemporaries. He also appears to have been influenced by the writings of contemporary Christian mystics, in particular Bernard of Clairvaux. 

That his home was in Strasbourg is supported by the fact that the earliest manuscripts of &quot;Tristan&quot;, dating from the first half of the 13th century, show features of Alemannic and specifically Alsatian dialect.

==Style==
Gottfried&#x27;s rhetorical style is very distinct among his contemporaries. 
It is incredibly complex, marked by the extensive use of symmetrical structure in his organization of &quot;Tristan&quot; as a whole, as well as in the structure of individual passages. Gottfried also uses detailed word and sound patterns, playing with such things as rhyme, alliteration, and assonance. See Batts (1971) for a detailed analysis.

One of the greatest hallmarks of Gottfried&#x27;s style is his skillful use of irony, to both humorous and tragic effects. He may also have relied on irony to disguise his criticisms of contemporary society in order to avoid censure.

==Sources==
Gottfried states that the &quot;Tristan&quot; of Thomas of Britain, an Anglo-French work of around 1160, was the source of his work. He explains that he bases himself on Thomas because he &quot;told the tale correctly&quot;, distancing himself from the less courtly versions of the story represented by Béroul in Old French and Eilhart von Oberge in Middle High German.

Unfortunately, Thomas&#x27;s work, too, is fragmentary and there is little overlap with Gottfried&#x27;s poem, making it difficult to evaluate Gottfried&#x27;s originality directly. However, Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; was the source of a number of other versions, which makes it possible to get some idea of style and content. It is clear that while Gottfried&#x27;s statement of his reliance on and debt to Thomas is correct, he both expanded on his source and refined the story psychologically. The discovery in 1995 of the Carlisle Fragment of Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot;, which includes material from one of the central parts of the story, the Love Grotto episode, promises a better understanding of Gottfried&#x27;s use of his source.

Thomas&#x27;s source, in turn, is a now lost Old French Tristan story, reconstructed by Joseph Bédier, which derives ultimately from Celtic legend.

==Text==
The text of &quot;Tristan&quot; is 19,548 lines long, and is written, like all courtly romances, in rhyming couplets.

The first section (ll. 1-44) of the prologue is written in quatrains and is referred to as the &quot;strophic prologue&quot;, while pairs of quatrains, of sententious content, mark the main divisions of the story. The initial letters of the quatrains, indicated by large initials in some manuscripts, form an acrostic with the names &quot;Gotefrid-Tristan-Isolde&quot;, which runs throughout the poem. In addition, the initial letters of the quatrains in the prologue give the name &quot;Dieterich&quot;, which is assumed to have been the name of Gottfried&#x27;s patron.

If Gottfried had completed &quot;Tristan&quot; it would probably have been around 24,000 lines long.

==Story==
The story starts with the courtship of Tristan&#x27;s parents. Riwalin, King of Parmenie, travels to the court of King Marke in Cornwall, where he and Marke&#x27;s sister, Blanschefleur, fall in love. Blanschefleur becomes pregnant and the couple steal back to Parmenie, but Riwalin is killed in battle. When she hears the news, Blanschefleur dies, but the baby is delivered and survives. He is named Tristan because of the sorrowful circumstances of his birth.

Tristan grows up in Parmenie, passed off as the son of Riwalin&#x27;s marshal Rual li Fointeant, becoming the perfect courtier. While on board a merchant ship which has docked in Parmenie, Tristan is abducted by the Norwegian crew. Once at sea, the ship is struck by a tempest, the crew conclude that they are being punished by God for abducting Tristan, so they set him ashore in a country that turns out to be Cornwall.

Tristan encounters a hunting party, whom he astonishes with his skill, and he accompanies them to Marke&#x27;s court, where his many accomplishments make him popular, particularly with Marke. Eventually, after years of searching, Rual comes to Cornwall and finds Tristan, who is now revealed as Marke&#x27;s nephew. Tristan is knighted.

Cornwall is being forced to pay tribute to the King of Ireland, Gurmun, collected by his brother, the monstrous Morold. Tristan challenges Morold to a duel and defeats him, though in the process he is wounded by Morold&#x27;s poisoned sword. In order to seek a cure Tristan travels to Ireland incognito (under the name Tantris), and contrives to get himself cured by Gurmun&#x27;s Queen Isolde (Isolde the Wise). He is struck by the beauty and accomplishments of her daughter, Isolde the Fair, and returns to Cornwall singing her praises.

Jealous of Tristan, Marke&#x27;s councillors press him to marry, so that Tristan can be ousted as heir. Hoping that he will be killed in the process, they suggest Tristan be sent to Ireland to woo Isolde for Marke. Tristan travels to Ireland (as Tantris) and kills a dragon which has been threatening the countryside, thus winning Isolde&#x27;s hand. However, observing that the splinter previously found in Morold&#x27;s skull matches Tantris&#x27;s sword, Isolde realises Tantris is in fact Tristan, and threatens to kill him as he sits in the bath. Her mother and her kinswoman Brangaene intervene and Tristan explains the purpose of his journey, which leads to a reconciliation between Ireland and Cornwall. Tristan leaves for Cornwall with Isolde as a bride for Marke.

Isolde the Wise has given Brangaene a magic potion to be drunk by Marke and Isolde on their wedding night to ensure their love. On the voyage, however, it is drunk by Tristan and Isolde by mistake. They avow their love for each other, but know that it cannot be made public, and they enjoy a brief idyll on board before arriving in Cornwall. This is followed by a series of intrigues in which the lovers attempt to dupe Marke, starting with the wedding night, when the virgin Brangaene substitutes for Isolde in the marriage bed. Marke is suspicious but is constantly outwitted by the lovers&#x27; guile.

Eventually, Marke resigns himself to their love and banishes them from court. They go off into the wilderness, to a Love Grotto, where they enjoy an idyllic life away from society. By accident, Marke discovers the grotto and sees them lying side by side. However, aware of his approach, Tristan has placed his sword between himself and Isolde, duping Marke into believing that perhaps they are not lovers after all.

With their secret hideaway discovered, the lovers return to court. However, Marke&#x27;s suspicions return and finally he finds them together and can no longer doubt their adultery. Tristan flees to Normandy, where he encounters Isolde of the White Hands, daughter of the Duke of Arundel. Gottfried&#x27;s poem ends with Tristan expressing his emotional confusion over the two Isoldes.

In Thomas&#x27;s poem, which is preserved from around this point, Tristan marries Isolde of the White Hands, though the marriage is never consummated. Tristan creates a hall of statues, with statues of Isolde and Brangaene. Tristan is wounded with a poisoned spear by Estult li Orgillus, and sends for Isolde the Fair, who is the only one who can cure him. It is agreed that the ship sent for her will bear a white sail if it returns with her on board, but a black sail if not. However, the jealous Isolde of the White Hands lies about the colour of the sail, and Isolde the Fair arrives to find Tristan dead of grief. She kisses him and dies.

==Interpretation==
Gottfried&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; has proved problematic to interpret, probably in part because it was arguably left unfinished. Much of critics&#x27; difficulty in interpreting the work was entirely intentional on the part of Gottfried; his extensive use of irony in the text is clearly the greatest cause of disagreement over the meaning of his poem.

&quot;Tristan&quot; contrasts significantly with the works of Gottfried&#x27;s contemporaries in three ways:
* The hero of &quot;Tristan&quot; is a primarily an artist and trickster rather than a knight, that is, he lives on his wits rather than his martial prowess. While Tristan has all the accomplishments of a knight, questions of chivalric ethos are irrelevant to the story and the role of the fighting man in society, central to the works of Hartmann von Aue and Wolfram von Eschenbach, is never at issue.
* Contemporary heroes fall in love with a lady because of her beauty and her moral worth. Tristan and Isolde, in spite of their physical beauty and many accomplishments, which cause them to be generally adored, fall in love not for any such explicable reason, but because the love potion leaves them no choice.
* Where contemporaries look for balance in life and subordination of the will of the individual (whether to God, or society, or both), Gottfried appears to exalt love as the supreme value, regardless of social consequences and heedless of the sinful nature of Tristan and Isolde&#x27;s adultery.

This &quot;exaltation of love&quot; has led some critics to see &quot;Tristan&quot; as effectively heretical, with Tristan and Isolde as &quot;saints&quot; of a religion of love, though how such a work could have been repeatedly read and copied at 13th century courts remains puzzling. Does the use of religious language imagery for the lovers mean that they represent an alternative religion, or is this simply a technique to communicate their exemplary role and the sublime nature of their love?

Alternatively, some critics see the work not as a pure exaltation of love, but rather as an exploration of the conflict between passionate love and courtly social order. That Tristan is not knightly represents a rejection of the norms of feudal society; he allows himself to be guided by love and physical passion rather than chivalry. The deaths of Tristan and Isolde would then seem inevitable, in that their love could not overcome the contemporary social order.

The role of the potion remains contentious - is it:
* simply a narrative device, of no import in itself, but required to deflect moral criticism?
* a symbol of their falling in love?
* the cause of their love, indicating love&#x27;s irrational and irresistible nature?

The story itself also raises problems. If the power of the love potion is irresistible, how can Tristan&#x27;s marriage to Isolde of the White Hands be explained? If love is the supreme value, why do Tristan and Isolde leave their idyllic life in the Love Grotto, to return to a life of occasional secret trysts? Some have even argued that Gottfried abandoned the work, unable to solve these contradictions.

==Gottfried and his contemporaries==
One of the most important passages in &quot;Tristan&quot;, one which owes nothing to Thomas, is the so-called &quot;literary excursus&quot;, in which Gottfried names and discusses the merits of a number of contemporary lyric and narrative poets. This is the first piece of literary criticism in German.

Gottfried praises the Minnesänger Reinmar von Hagenau and Walther von der Vogelweide, and the narrative poets Hartmann von Aue, Heinrich von Veldeke and Bligger von Steinach, the former for their musicality, the latter for their clarity, both features which mark Gottfried&#x27;s own style. Conversely, he criticises, without naming him directly, Wolfram von Eschenbach for the obscurity of his style and the uncouthness of his vocabulary.

==Reception==

There are 29 known manuscripts of Gottfried&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot;, dating from the 13th to the 15th century. Of these 11 are complete.

The unfinished &quot;Tristan&quot; was completed by two later poets, Ulrich von Türheim around 1235 and Heinrich von Freiberg around 1290, but their source for the latter part of the story is not Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot;, and is generally thought to be the earlier and less courtly version of the story by Eilhart von Oberge, written around 1175. All but two of the complete manuscripts of Gottfried&#x27;s work include a continuation by Ulrich or Heinrich; one uses the final part of Eilhart&#x27;s work. Only one has no continuation at all.

Gottfried&#x27;s work is praised by a number of later 13th-century writers, including Rudolf von Ems and Konrad von Würzburg, and was used, together with Eilhart von Oberge&#x27;s version and Heinrich von Freiberg&#x27;s continuation as a source for the Old Czech &quot;Tristan&quot;, written in the latter third of the 14th century.

While Gottfried&#x27;s poem was still being copied in the 15th century, it was Eilhart von Oberge&#x27;s less sophisticated narrative of the Tristan story that was the source of the first printed version, the 1484 &quot;Tristrant und Isalde&quot;, a work in prose which is not to be confused with the French Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, also known as the &quot;Roman de Tristan en Prose&quot;.

Gottfried&#x27;s work was rediscovered in the late 18th century, and is the source of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (1865).

==Editions==
The first modern edition of Gottfried&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; was that of Christian Heinrich Myller in 1785, and there have been many since. However, there is still no satisfactory critical edition and three editions are in use:
* Friedrich Ranke (Weidmann 1930, with corrections 1949). This is the standard edition, but contains no critical apparatus. Most readily available in 3 volumes with Modern German translation, commentary and epilogue by Rüdiger Krohn (Reclam 1980) , and . All &quot;Tristan&quot; literature uses Ranke&#x27;s line numbering for references to the text.
** Digital copy (Universitätsbibliothek Paderborn).
** Plain text, without line numbering (Projekt Gutenberg-DE). 
* K. Marold (de Gruyter 1906), republished in 2004 with an afterword by Werner Schröder . Though the text is inferior to Ranke&#x27;s, this is the only edition to provide full critical apparatus.
* R. Bechstein (2 vols, Leipzig, 1870), re-issued in a revised version edited by Peter Ganz (2 vols, Brockhaus 1978), which includes Bechstein&#x27;s running commentary and indicates differences from Ranke&#x27;s text.

==Translations==
English translations:
*Jessie Weston (London, 1899)
*E.H. Zeydel (Princeton, 1948)
*A.T. Hatto, with the &quot;Tristran&quot; of Thomas (London: Penguin, 1960). 
*William T. Whobrey, Tristan and Isolde, with Ulrich von Türheim&#x27;s Continuation (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2020). 
Modern German translations:
*Xenja von Ertzdorff, Doris Scholz, Carola Voelkel (Fink, 1979) 
*Wolfgang Mohr (Kümmerle, 1979), in verse, based on Hermann Kurtz&#x27;s translation 
*Rüdiger Krohn (Reclam 1980) and 
*Dieter Kühn (Reclam, 1998) 
*Peter Knecht (de Gruyter, 2004) 

There are many older translations. However, any made before 1930, when Ranke&#x27;s edition was first published, will be based on an outdated edition of the text.

<text>USS &quot;Mobile&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Mobile&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Mobile&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Mobile&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company on 14 April 1941. She was launched on 15 May 1942, and was commissioned in March 1943. The ship conducted an initial shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay and then went on a short training cruise to Casco Bay, Maine. &quot;Mobile&quot; then departed the East Coast of the United States for the Pacific to join the forces waging the war against Japan. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 23 July, where she took part in a month of training to prepare for combat operations.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign===
&quot;Mobile&quot; got underway on 22 August to rendezvous with Task Force 15 the following day. The unit was on the way to raid Marcus Island, which was carried out on 31 August. The ships raided two other Japanese-held islands the following month before joining the rest of the 5th Fleet for the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. This was the first major operation in the island-hopping campaign the US Navy would wage across the Central Pacific, and the fleet&#x27;s carrier force was primarily occupied with isolating targeted islands, neutralizing Japanese forces on surrounding islands, and supporting ground forces as they made their amphibious assaults. &quot;Mobile&quot; served as part of the defensive screen for the task force&#x27;s aircraft carriers while they conducted preparatory raids on Tarawa on 18 September. She was transferred to Task Group 53.3 by 21 October, which sailed west to support landings on Bougainville Island in the Solomon Islands. From there, she sailed for Espiritu Santo, where she was transferred to TG 53.7 for the Battle of Tarawa. &quot;Mobile&quot; provided gunfire support to the marines fighting on Tarawa and Betio from 20 to 28 November.

&quot;Mobile&quot; transferred to TF 50 on 1 December, which was the progenitor of the fast carrier task force. &quot;Mobile&quot; escorted the carriers as they steamed north to launch air strikes on the Marshall Islands, targeting Japanese installations on Kwajalein Atoll and Wotje Atoll. The ships of TF 50 then sailed for Pearl Harbor for replenishment. &quot;Mobile&quot; was detached to sail on to San Diego, California, where on 29 December she joined the Amphibious Forces, 5th Fleet, serving in Cruiser Division 13 in TG 53.5, part of the escort group for the amphibious assault ships. The ships sortied two weeks later, bound for the Marshalls. &quot;Mobile&quot; and the rest of her division were detached on 29 January 1944 to bombard Wotje, while the rest of the fleet moved into position to invade Kwajalein. &quot;Mobile&quot; remained in the area through 6 February, bombarding Japanese forces on the island and assisting in the anti-aircraft defense of the carriers off the islands of Roi and Namur. She thereafter sailed for the fleet&#x27;s advance base at Majuro, arriving on 12 February to join TF 58 (which is what TF 50 had been re-designated).

===New Guinea campaign===

The ships of the fast carrier task force, including &quot;Mobile&quot; in TG 58.1, sortied from Majuro soon after arriving to make a major attack on the island of Truk in the Caroline Islands, to the west of the Marshalls. The raid, code-named Operation Hailstone, was intended to disrupt a major Japanese base in the region to reduce its ability to interfere both with the coming Battle of Eniwetok (the last phase of the Marshalls campaign) and Allied operations in New Guinea, to the south. The carriers struck the island on 16 and 17 February, including severe damage on the facilities in Truk. The American fleet then continued on to raid the Mariana Islands, hitting targets on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam on 21 and 22 February. The fleet returned to Majuro. After replenishing stores and ammunition, the ships of TG 58.1 sailed south for Espiritu Santo. They were re-designated as TG 36.1 on 12 March for direct support of operations in the New Guinea campaign. The ships sortied on 15 March to cover a marine landing on Emirau on 20 March.

In the course of &quot;Mobile&quot;″s first year in service, she had taken part in eleven operations and cruised for more than . On 27 March, TG 36.1 resumed its previous designation as TG 58.1. The ships got underway again shortly thereafter to raid the Palau Islands, targeting Japanese positions on Yap and Woleai between 29 March and 3 April before returning to Majuro to replenish on 5 April. The group got underway again to rejoin the fighting in western New Guinea, supporting landings at Aitape, Humboldt Bay, and Tanahmerah Bay in the Battle of Hollandia. The ships then attacked Wakde Airfield and Sawar Airfield on 21 and 22 April, before turning back north to raid Truk again. The ships bombarded Satawan on 29 and 30 April and Pohnpei on 1 May, and then departed for Majuro to make preparations for the next major campaign in the central Pacific.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===

The fast carrier task force, with &quot;Mobile&quot; still in the anti-aircraft screen, got underway again on 6 June to begin operations in the Marianas. They reached the island chain on 11 June and began air strikes on Japanese defenses on Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and Rota over the following several days. During this period, the ships also steamed north to raid the Bonin Islands to interdict Japanese reinforcements being sent to the Marianas. On 18 June, reports of an approaching Japanese fleet prompted the fast carrier task force to sail west and begin searches for its opponent. In the Battle of the Philippine Sea, which began on 19 June, the Japanese struck first, but failed to inflict significant damage. &quot;Mobile&quot; contributed her anti-aircraft fire to the fleet&#x27;s defense, and her OS2U Kingfisher search planes were used to search for Japanese submarines and to pick up downed pilots. The American carrier aircraft inflicted heavy losses on their Japanese counterparts and sank the carrier (the carriers and had been sunk by American submarines the previous day).

On 23 June, the fast carrier task force sailed back east to raid Pagan in the Marianas the following day. The ships then withdrew to Eniwetok for replenishment, which lasted until the end of the month, when they sortied again for another round of strikes on the Bonin Islands. These were carried out o 4 July, after which the fleet returned to the Marianas to resume operations in support of the ground forces fighting on the islands. These operations continued until 23 June, when TG 58.1, including &quot;Mobile&quot;, was detached for a raid on the western Caroline Islands, including the atolls at Yap, Ulithi, and Fais. Other carrier groups attacked the Palau Islands at the same time; the strikes continued until 30 August, when the task groups turned back to concentrate off Saipan. Task Force 58 reconstituted itself there on 2 August.

After re-forming, the ships of TF 58 steamed north for another series of attacks on the Bonins, raiding Iwo Jima, Chichijima, and Hahajima on 4 August. &quot;Mobile&quot; and the rest of Cruiser Division 13, along with Destroyer Division 46, were detached to make a sweep off Chichijima to search for Japanese shipping. The ships encountered a destroyer and a cargo ship, and &quot;Mobile&quot; contributed to both of their sinkings. The ships bombarded Chichijima the following day and then departed to return to Eniwetok. There, the fast carrier task force passed from 5th Fleet to 3rd Fleet, becoming Task Force 38. &quot;Mobile&quot;″s group was accordingly re-numbered as TG 38.3. The task force sortied again to attack the Palau Islands again, the strikes lasting from 6 to 8 September. They then steamed further west to attack Mindanao in the southern Philippines on 9 and 10 September, and the Visayas in the central Philippines on 12 and 13 September. Afterward, the ships returned to Palau to support the amphibious assaults on Peleliu and Anguar and the first few days of the Battle of Peleliu. TG 38.3 then sailed back west to attack Japanese positions in the Philippines, including targets in the Manila area and the Visayas again, between 21 and 24 September.

===Philippine campaign===
After another period of replenishment, this time at the recently-conquered Ulithi, the ships of TF 38 got underway on 6 October for the next major operation: the liberation of the Philippines. &quot;Mobile&quot; escorted the carriers for the first operation in the campaign, a series of air raids on the Ryukyu Islands and Formosa intended to neutralize Japanese air forces that could intervene in the upcoming landings. During the attacks on the Ryukyus, &quot;Mobile&quot; and the destroyers and were detached to sink a pair of Japanese vessels that had been detected some from the fleet. They only found and sank one of the vessels, a large cargo ship, the other having already been sunk by American carrier aircraft. The ships rejoined the task force as it proceeded southwest to wage attacks on Formosa and the Pescadores.

During the ensuing Formosa Air Battle on 13 October, &quot;Mobile&quot;″s sister ship and the heavy cruiser were both torpedoed and badly damaged by Japanese aircraft. &quot;Mobile&quot; and several other vessels were detached from TF 38 to cover the withdrawal of what was nicknamed &quot;Cripple Division 1&quot;. The American forces hoped that further Japanese forces would be lured out to be destroyed, but the Americans were detected by Japanese scout aircraft and the bait was not taken. Once the damaged vessels had withdrawn far enough to be out of range of Japanese aircraft, &quot;Mobile&quot; left the formation and returned to TG 38.3, arriving with her unit on 17 October.

&quot;Mobile&quot; and the rest of the fast carrier task force then turned south to begin attacks on the Philippines themselves as the invasion approached. They struck targets in the northern Philippines on 20 October and move south over the following days, attacking installations in southern Luzon and the Visayas to degrade Japanese forces in the area. In response, the Japanese launched a multi-pronged counterattack that resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. On 24 October, TG 38.3 came under attack from aircraft from the Northern Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, in the Battle off Cape Engaño, one of the constituent actions of the Leyte Gulf battle. The fast carrier task force steamed north to attack Ozawa&#x27;s carriers and inflicted serious damage. &quot;Mobile&quot; and several other surface ships were sent to make a sweep for crippled Japanese vessels, and she assisted in the sinking of the light carrier and the destroyer . They then rejoined the task force to return south.

For the next two months, the fast carrier task force operated in the Philippines, covering the next several amphibious invasions of islands in the Visayas and on Mindoro. &quot;Mobile&quot; continued in her role as a carrier escort during this period, until she was detached to sail home for repairs and maintenance. She stopped in Ulithi on the way, departing there on 26 December and arriving at Terminal Island, California, sixteen days later.

===End of the war===
&quot;Mobile&quot; arrived back in Ulithi on 29 March 1945, but she soon departed to join the invasion fleet off Okinawa. She arrived there on 3 April and was assigned to Task Force 51, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet; the Battle of Okinawa had begun two days before her arrival. The ship operated off the island for the next two months, bombarding Japanese positions on the island, providing anti-aircraft defense to the invasion fleet, and participating in anti-submarine patrols. She was also periodically assigned to groups patrolling for Japanese suicide boats. In late May, &quot;Mobile&quot; was detached to return to the Philippines to join Task Group 95.7, the Philippine Training Group, where she remained for the rest of the war. &quot;Mobile&quot; was awarded eleven battle stars during her wartime career.

===Post-War===
With the war over, &quot;Mobile&quot; left San Pedro Bay in the Philippines on 20 August, bound for Okinawa to join the forces available for occupation duty. She made several cruises between Okinawa and the Japanese Home Islands in September, carrying prisoners of war who had been liberated after the surrender of Japan. In October, she operated off Sasebo, and on 18 November, she departed Japanese waters with a contingent of sailors and marines aboard, bound for San Diego, California, the first of two Operation Magic Carpet voyages she would make. She arrived there on 2 December and then made her second trip, after which she went to Puget Sound to be laid up. She was decommissioned on 9 May 1947 and allocated to the reserve fleet based in Bremerton, Washington, where she remained until 1 March 1959. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register that day and was sold to ship breakers on 16 December, and was eventually towed away to the breakers&#x27; yard on 19 January 1960.

<text>Agatha of Sicily () is a Christian saint. Her feast is on 5 February. Agatha was born in Catania, part of the Roman Province of Sicily, and was martyred . She is one of several virgin martyrs who are commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass.

Agatha is the patron saint of Catania, Molise, Malta, San Marino, Gallipoli in Apulia, and Zamarramala, a municipality of the Province of Segovia in Spain. She is also the patron saint of breast cancer patients, rape victims,
martyrs, wet nurses, bell-founders, and bakers, and is invoked against fire, earthquakes, and eruptions of Mount Etna.

==Early history==
Agatha is buried at the Badia di Sant&#x27;Agata, Catania. She is listed in the late-6th-century associated with Jerome, and the , the calendar of the church of Carthage, . Agatha also appears in one of the of Venantius Fortunatus.

Two early churches were dedicated in her honor in Rome, Sant&#x27;Agata in Trastevere and notably the Church of Sant&#x27;Agata dei Goti in Via Mazzarino, a titular church with apse mosaics of and traces of a fresco cycle, overpainted by Gismondo Cerrini in 1630. In the 6th century AD, the church was adapted to Arianism, hence its name &quot;Saint Agatha of Goths&quot;, and later reconsecrated by Gregory the Great, who confirmed her traditional sainthood.

Agatha is also depicted in the mosaics of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, where she appears, richly dressed, in the procession of virgin martyrs along the north wall. Her image forms an initial &#x27;I&#x27; in the Sacramentary of Gellone, which dates from the end of the 8th century.

==Life==
One of the most highly venerated virgin martyrs of Christian antiquity, Agatha was put to death during the Decian persecution (250–253) in Catania, Sicily, for her determined profession of faith.

Her written legend comprises &quot;straightforward accounts of interrogation, torture, resistance, and triumph which constitute some of the earliest hagiographic literature&quot;, and are reflected in later recensions, the earliest surviving one being an illustrated late-10th-century &quot;passio&quot;.
According to the 13th-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (III.15) by Jacobus de Voragine, 15-year-old Agatha, from a rich and noble family, made a vow of virginity and rejected the amorous advances of the Roman prefect Quintianus, who thought he could force her to turn away from her vow and marry him. His persistent proposals were consistently spurned by Agatha. This was during the persecutions of Decius, so Quintianus, knowing she was a Christian, reported her to the authorities. Quintianus himself was governor of the district.

Quintianus expected Agatha to give in to his demands when faced with torture and possible death, but Agatha simply reaffirmed her belief in God by praying: &quot;Jesus Christ, Lord of all, you see my heart, you know my desires. Possess all that I am. I am your sheep: make me worthy to overcome the devil.&quot; To force her to change her mind, Quintianus sent Agatha to Aphrodisia, the keeper of a brothel, and had her imprisoned there; however, the punishment failed, with Agatha remaining a Christian.
Quintianus sent for Agatha again, arguing with her and threatening her, before finally having her imprisoned and tortured. She was stretched on a rack to be torn with iron hooks, burned with torches, and whipped. Her breasts were removed by tongs. After further dramatic confrontations with Quintianus, represented in a sequence of dialogues in her &quot;passio&quot; that document her fortitude and steadfast devotion, Agatha was then sentenced to be burnt at the stake; however, an earthquake prevented this from happening, and she was instead sent to prison, where St. Peter the Apostle appeared to her and healed her wounds.

Agatha died in prison, probably in the year 251 according to the . Although the martyrdom of Agatha is authenticated, and her veneration as a saint had spread beyond her native place even in antiquity, there is no reliable information concerning the details of her death.

Osbern Bokenam, &quot;A Legend of Holy Women&quot;, written in the 1440s, offers some further detail.

==Veneration==
According to Maltese tradition, during the persecution of Roman Emperor Decius (AD 249–251), Agatha, together with some of her friends, fled from Sicily and took refuge in Malta. Some historians believe that her stay on the island was rather short, and she spent her days in a rock-hewn crypt at Rabat, praying and teaching Christianity to children. After some time, Agatha returned to Sicily, where she faced martyrdom. Agatha was arrested and brought before Quintianus, praetor of Catania, who condemned her to torture and imprisonment.

The crypt of St. Agatha is an underground basilica, which from early ages was venerated by the Maltese. At the time of St. Agatha&#x27;s stay, the crypt was a small natural cave, which, later on, during the 4th or 5th century, was enlarged and embellished.

After the Reformation era, Agatha was retained in the calendar of the Church of England&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer with her feast on 5 February. Several Church of England parish churches are dedicated in her honor.

A feast day to honor Agatha on 5 February was given final authorization in the Episcopal Church in 2022.

The translation of her relics is commemorated on 10 March and 17 August.

===Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania===

The Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania is a major festival in the region, it takes place during the first five days of February. The Catania Cathedral (also known as ) is dedicated in her honor.

==Patronage==
Saint Agatha is the patron saint of rape victims, breast cancer patients, wet nurses, and bellfounders (due to the shape of her severed breasts). She is also considered to be a powerful intercessor when people suffer from fires. Her feast day is celebrated on 5 February.

She is also a patron saint of Malta, where in 1551 her intercession through a reported apparition to a Benedictine nun is said to have saved Malta from Turkish invasion.

She became the patron saint of the Republic of San Marino after Pope Clement XII restored the independence of the state on her feast day of 5 February 1740.

She is also the patron saint of Catania, Sorihuela del Guadalimar (Spain), Molise, San Marino and Kalsa, a historical quarter of Palermo.

She is claimed as the patroness of Palermo. The year after her death, the stilling of an eruption of Mount Etna was attributed to her intercession. As a result, apparently, people continued to ask her prayers for protection against fire.

In Switzerland, Agatha is considered the patron saint of fire services.

In the United Kingdom, Agatha is the patron saint of bell ringers in service of the Catholic Church.

==Iconography==
Saint Agatha is often depicted iconographically carrying her excised breasts on a platter, as in Bernardino Luini&#x27;s &quot;Saint Agatha&quot; (1510–1515) in the Galleria Borghese, Rome, in which Agatha contemplates the breasts on a standing salver held in her hand.

The tradition of making shaped pastry on the feast of St. Agatha, such as Agatha bread or buns, or so-called (&quot;Breasts of St. Agatha&quot;) or (&quot;Breasts of the virgin&quot;), is found in many countries.

==Legacy==
The Basque people have a tradition of gathering on Saint Agatha&#x27;s Eve () and going door-to-door through their village. Homeowners can then choose to hear a song about Agatha&#x27;s life, which is accompanied by the beats of the choir&#x27;s walking sticks on the ground or else a prayer for the household&#x27;s deceased. After that, the homeowner donates food to the choir. The song&#x27;s lyrics vary according to each local tradition and the Basque language dialect spoken locally. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, a version of the song in Spanish was composed. In the lyrics, this Spanish version praised the Soviet ship &quot;Komsomol&quot;, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the Second Spanish Republic.

An annual festival to commemorate the life of Saint Agatha takes place in Catania, Sicily, from 3 to 5 February. The festival culminates in an all-night procession through the city.

St. Agatha&#x27;s Tower is a former Knight&#x27;s stronghold located in the north west of Malta. The seventeenth-century tower served as a military base during both World Wars and was used as a radar station by the Maltese army.

St. Agatha is also commemorated in literature. The Italian poet Martha Marchina wrote an epigram in that commemorates her martyrdom. In it, Marchina characterizes Agatha as powerful and she reclaims that power because she has become more beautiful through her wounds.

Agatha of Sicily is honored with a Lesser Feast on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on 5 February.

Agatha is a featured figure on Judy Chicago&#x27;s 1979 installation piece &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, being represented as one of the 999 names on the &quot;Heritage Floor&quot;.

<text>Margaret Rhea Seddon (born November 8, 1947) is an American surgeon and retired NASA astronaut. After being selected as part of the first group of astronauts to include women in 1978, she flew on three Space Shuttle flights: as a mission specialist on STS-51-D and STS-40, and as a payload commander for STS-58, accumulating over 722 hours in space. On these flights, she built repair tools for a US Navy satellite and performed medical experiments.

A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Seddon was awarded her doctor of medicine (MD) degree in 1973. During her residency with the University of Tennessee hospitals, she was the only woman in the General Surgery Residency Program. Before, during, and after her career in the astronaut program, she was active in hospitals emergency departments in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Texas.

Seddon became an astronaut on August 9, 1979, after selection as a candidate the year prior. At NASA her development work included the Space Shuttle Orbiter and payload software, the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, the Flight Data File, the Space Shuttle medical kit, and checklists for launch and landing. She was a rescue helicopter physician for the early Space Shuttle flights and a support crew member for STS-6. She served as a member of NASA&#x27;s Aerospace Medical Advisory Committee, as a technical assistant to the director of flight crew operations, and as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center. In 1996 she was detailed by NASA to Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee, where she assisted in the preparation of cardiovascular experiments that flew on the STS-90 Neurolab Spacelab flight in April 1998. She retired from NASA in November 1997 and became Assistant Chief Medical Officer of the Vanderbilt Medical Group.

==Early life and education==
Margaret Rhea Seddon was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on November 8, 1947, the first child of Edward C. Seddon, a lawyer, and his wife Clayton Ransom Dann. She had a younger sister, Louise. Seddon was named after her maternal grandmother, and known by her middle name, Rhea, which is pronounced &quot;ray&quot;. She grew up in Murfreesboro, where she attended St. Rose of Lima Catholic School. The nuns at St. Rose did not teach science until the Sputnik crisis made it a national priority. A science teacher was then recruited, and Seddon began studying science in the seventh grade. In 1960 she wrote a school report on what would happen to people who ventured into space. She attended Central High School in Murfreesboro, where she was a cheerleader. She graduated in 1965.

A friend of the family, Lois Kennedy, was a physician—Seddon worked in her office one summer—and inspired her to pursue a career in medicine. Another friend of the family, Florence Ridley, a professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles, recommended some universities in California with good life sciences programs. Seddon entered the University of California, Berkeley, where she joined the Sigma Kappa sorority. Her father had been on the board of directors of Rutherford County Hospital, which was opening a new coronary care unit in the summer after her freshman year, and he arranged for Seddon to spend her summer there as an aide. However, the new center&#x27;s opening was delayed, and she spent the summer working in the surgical unit, where she decided to become a surgeon. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in physiology in 1970.

During her senior year at Berkeley, Seddon was accepted by the University of Tennessee College of Medicine. When she matriculated in 1970, there were only six women in the class of more than one hundred medical students. She was awarded her Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree in 1973. Her father paid for flying lessons as a graduation gift. Seddon did her one-year internship at the Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis. Women were not permitted in the surgery doctors&#x27; lounge there, so she had to wait between cases on a folding chair in the nurses&#x27; bathroom. She then did three years of residency at the University of Tennessee hospitals in Memphis, where she was the only woman in the General Surgery Residency Program. She worked in emergency departments at several hospitals in Mississippi and Tennessee, despite this being against the rules of the residency program.

==NASA career==
===Selection===
On July 8, 1976, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued a call for applications for pilot and mission specialist candidates. It was the first time that women were encouraged to apply. A colleague, Russ Greer, a neurosurgery resident who had worked at NASA and was aware that Seddon had expressed an interest in becoming an astronaut, informed Seddon of the selection process that was underway, and she decided to apply. She wrote to NASA and was sent an application form. She found that at in height, she was just tall enough to meet the minimum height requirement of for mission specialists. The application required three references, and she chose three people who had most strongly influenced her to that point: James Pate, the head of surgery at the hospital; Jose Guma, her flying instructor; and Jim Arnhart, the administrator of Rutherford Hospital.

From 8,079 applicants NASA identified 208 for further screening, conducted in groups of about twenty. Seddon was contacted by Jay F. Honeycutt from NASA and was asked to come to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for a week of interviews and physical examinations, beginning August 29, 1977. Her group of twenty applicants was the first one that included women. Among the eight women in the group were Anna Sims, Shannon Lucid, Nitza Cintron, and Millie Hughes-Wiley. Afterwards, she returned to the Memphis Veterans Administration Hospital, where she commenced a residency in plastic surgery. She soon changed course again after she developed a particular interest in the nutrition of surgery patients. In January 1978 journalist Jules Bergman asked if he could interview her on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and he revealed that she had been selected for astronaut training; Seddon received official word from George Abbey, NASA&#x27;s Director of Flight Crew Operations on January 16. The names of the 35 successful candidates in NASA Astronaut Group 8 were publicly released later that day.

===Training===
New selections were considered astronaut candidates rather than full-fledged astronauts until they finished their training and evaluation, which was expected to take two years. Group8&#x27;s name for itself was &quot;TFNG&quot;. The abbreviation was deliberately ambiguous; for public purposes, it stood for &quot;Thirty-Five New Guys&quot;, but within the group itself, it was known to stand for the military phrase, &quot;the fucking new guy&quot;, used to denote newcomers to a military unit. Pilot training was not required of mission specialist candidates, but they were given training in how to handle emergencies while flying in the back seat of NASA&#x27;s Northrop T-38 Talon jets. Seddon had a private pilot license, and logged time spent in the T-38 as co-pilot time. Due to her small size and the ill-fitting parachute harness she had to wear, she had trouble climbing into the aircraft.

A particularly difficult part of the curriculum for Seddon was SCUBA training, which was conducted in the pool at the Clear Lake Recreational Center. She was not a strong swimmer, and it took practice and exercise to develop proficiency. SCUBA training was a prerequisite for Extravehicular Activity (EVA) training, but Seddon was never considered for this because NASA did not have space suits in her small size. She was sent to the 1979 Paris Air Show to represent NASA along with Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton. The two of them drew crowds of people who wanted to see a famous astronaut or were curious about what a woman astronaut was like.

As an astronaut candidate, Seddon drew a civil service salary of about US$22,000 (), which was more than she made as a surgical resident. Nonetheless, when she went to buy a townhouse she was told that her income was $3,000 short of what was required, even with her father putting up the deposit. United Savings and Loan refused to lend her the money without her father&#x27;s co-signature. She also bought a new Chevrolet Corvette. She figured that her astronaut job took up only fifty to sixty hours a week, which left time to practice medicine. This required six months to obtain a Texas medical license and secure permission from NASA Headquarters, and another loan from her father to cover the license fee and malpractice insurance. After several months of serving in the emergency rooms of various hospitals, she met Diana Fire, a physician who worked at Sam Houston Memorial Hospital, and accepted an offer to work in the emergency room there on weekends. Seddon worked there until it closed twelve years later, then moved to Spring Branch Hospital, where she remained until she left Houston.
Seddon officially became an astronaut in August 1979, after NASA decided that one year of training was sufficient. As with earlier astronaut groups, each astronaut candidate was assigned a particular specialization; Seddon&#x27;s assignment was the Space Shuttle food system and the orbital medical kit. For STS-1, the first orbital spaceflight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and the inaugural flight of the , Abbey decided that the five MDs of the 1978 and 1980 astronaut groupsNorman Thagard, Anna Fisher and Seddon from the 1978 group, and Bill Fisher and Jim Bagian from the 1980 groupwould be assigned to the search and rescue helicopters supporting the flight. These would be required if the Space Shuttle crashed or the astronauts had to eject. Seddon was placed in charge of the group, and as such could choose her assignment. She, therefore, decided to join the group at Cape Canaveral. In the event, the mission went well, and search and rescue were not required.

In February 1981 Seddon became engaged to fellow astronaut Robert L. &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson. They were married on May 30 in a ceremony at the First United Methodist Church in Murfreesboro, followed by a reception at the Stones River Country Club. A second reception was held in Houston, followed by a honeymoon in Hawaii. Seddon (who retained her maiden name) then resumed her role with search and rescue in preparation for the upcoming STS-2 mission. She also worked in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, where the Space Shuttle&#x27;s software was tested.

Seddon&#x27;s first child was born in July 1982 and was named Paul Seddon Gibson after Gibson&#x27;s father. Gibson already had one child, a daughter called Julie, from his first marriage. While many astronauts had children, this was the first child born to an astronaut couple. The newborn suffered from a serious condition arising from inhaling meconium and was rushed by helicopter from Clear Lake Hospital to Houston&#x27;s Hermann Hospital, where he soon responded to treatment.

===Space flights===
In August 1983 Abbey offered Seddon a flight assignment on STS-41-E, which she accepted. Had the mission been flown as planned in August 1984, she would have become the third American woman to fly in space, but the mission, which was renumbered STS-41-F, was delayed and then canceled. The crew was kept together and assigned to STS-51-E, but it too was delayed and canceled. Finally, they were assigned to STS-51-D. With each change of mission came different payloads requiring different training.

The mission was scheduled to lift off on March 19, 1985, but suffered a series of delays. STS-51-D lifted in the from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on April 12, 1985. The crew deployed the ANIK-C satellite for Telesat of Canada, and Syncom IV-3 for the US Navy. A malfunction in the Syncom spacecraft resulted in the first unscheduled spacewalk, rendezvous, and proximity operations for the Space Shuttle in an attempt to activate the satellite using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). Seddon used her surgical skills to operate a bone saw to help build homemade repair tools for the satellite. She was able to manually engage the start lever with the RMS, but the launch sequence did not commence, and the satellite was left in low Earth orbit. On this mission she logged 168 hours in 109 Earth orbits.

After the flight she presented a banner she had flown with to Central Middle School (as Central High School now was), and met President Ronald Reagan at the Oval Office in Washington, DC. The Syncom IV-3 satellite was retrieved, repaired, and launched into a geostationary orbit by the STS-51-I mission in August 1985.

Even before the STS-51-D mission was flown, Abbey offered Seddon a chance to fly on the Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-1) mission, which was scheduled to lift off aboard the in late January 1986. She accepted but had doubts about whether she could be ready in time with all her work and home commitments. As it turned out, there was ample time because it was delayed due to the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.
While she waited for her Spacelab Life Sciences mission to be scheduled, she sought out a refresher program in emergency medicine. Such programs were uncommon at the time, but she found one at Denver General Hospital. The course cost several thousand dollars, which she could not afford, but she wrote to Vincent Markovchik, the head of the program, and he agreed to waive the fee. In 1988 Abbey offered her the chance of another flight in the meantime, but Seddon declined, as she was hoping to have another child, and felt that the SLS-1 mission needed someone to watch over it, even if its launch was years in the future.

Seddon also began to think about acquiring some managerial experience and went to see Carolyn Huntoon, the head of the Space and Life Sciences Directorate at JSC, about a secondment to her area. Huntoon agreed to take Seddon on as an assistant in the spring of 1988. However, while Abbey was Director of Flight Operations, he had an astronaut technical assistant, known in the NASA Astronaut Corps as the &quot;Bubba&quot;. The main job of the technical assistant was acting as Abbey&#x27;s pilot, but the technical assistant also did many odd jobs on Abbey&#x27;s behalf. When Don Puddy succeeded Abbey, he considered abolishing the position, but in May 1988 Seddon was unexpectedly given the job. Under Puddy, the job no longer entailed being a personal pilot and driver, but Seddon still worked on a variety of tasks. These included preparations for the STS-26 &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission, and developing policies in cooperation with the Space and Life Sciences Directorate. She helped establish criteria for access to astronauts&#x27; psychiatric records, procedures for clearing astronauts as medically fit to fly, and processes for using astronauts for medical experiments. She left the position when she had her second child, Edward Dann Gibson (named after her father), who was born in March 1989.
When Seddon returned from maternity leave in July 1989, the launch of SLS-1 had been added to the flight schedule as STS-40, with a launch date of May 1990. By this time the crew had been training a few hours per month since January 1986, and the payload had been changed several times. It was so overbooked with experiments that the mission was split into two: SLS-1 and SLS-2. One crew member, Bob Phillips, was grounded with a minor medical condition and was replaced by Millie Hughes-Fulford. Hopes that training could now proceed uninterrupted were soon dashed; Seddon was called upon to participate in the selection of NASA Astronaut Group 13 (who became known as the &quot;Hairballs&quot;). And the schedule continued to slip.

The STS-40 SLS-1 mission finally lifted off from the KSC in the on June 5, 1991. During the nine-day mission, the crew performed experiments that explored how humans, animals, and cells respond to microgravity and re-adapt to Earth&#x27;s gravity on return. Other experiments were designed to investigate materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation, and tests of hardware proposed for the Space Station Freedom Health Maintenance Facility. The mission completed 146 orbits of the Earth, and Seddon logged an additional 218 hours in space.

From September 1991 to July 1992, Seddon was a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center, handling the STS-42 and STS-45 missions. She expressed a desire to Chief Astronaut Dan Brandenstein to participate in SLS-2, the follow-up mission to SLS-1. This was readily accommodated, as life sciences missions were not popular assignments among astronauts. In October 1991 she was designated the payload commander for the STS-58 / SLS-2 mission. This was a new position created to provide a single point of contact for the science crew. During training for the mission, she broke four bones in her foot while sliding down a Space Shuttle escape slide during a practice for an emergency evacuation. This was diagnosed as a Lisfranc fracture. Surgery was required to insert screws to realign the bones, and she had to spend six weeks in a cast and another six in a walking boot. This did not leave much time before the launch date, but there was no move to replace her, and the flight was delayed a few months for other reasons.
SLS-2 involved animal testing, with mice being dissected in space. At this time NASA management began to feel pressure from animal rights groups, and NASA Administrator Dan Goldin asked for a report on the animal experiments. Seddon and payload specialist Martin J. Fettman prepared a report on how the research could be conducted without killing animals, which amounted to removing body parts without killing them. Seddon and Fettman felt that this was unethical. NASA management ordered the Director of Flight Crew Operations, David Leestma, to modify the experiments to harvest organs without killing the test animals. Leestma ignored this and took no action, so the mission was flown as originally planned.

STS-58 with SLS-2 lifted off in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; on October 18, 1993. During the fourteen-day flight the seven-person crew performed , cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and musculoskeletal medical experiments on themselves and 48 rats, studying human and animal physiology both on Earth and in space flight. In addition, the crew performed ten engineering tests aboard the Orbiter Columbia and nine Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. The mission was accomplished in 225 orbits of the Earth in over 336 hours.
In June 1995 Seddon had her third child, a daughter she named Emilee Louise after her sister, who had died the year before. Seddon became the Assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations for Shuttle/Mir Payloads, a new position, which involved travel to Russia. In September 1996 she was detailed by NASA to Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee, as an assistant Chief Medical Officer, where she assisted in its organization and structuring. She also assisted in the preparation of cardiovascular experiments that flew aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; on the STS-90 Neurolab Spacelab flight in April 1998.

==Later life==
Seddon retired from NASA in November 1997, and for the next eleven years she was the assistant Chief Medical Officer of the Vanderbilt Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee.

She had begun writing her memoirs in December 1993 but set the project aside in June 1996. In 2008 she enrolled in a creative writing program at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. She afterwards completed her memoirs; the book, entitled &quot;Go For Orbit&quot;, was published in 2015 and won the Independent Book Publishers Association Ben Franklin Gold Award for Best Autobiography/Memoir.

==Awards and honors==
Seddon&#x27;s awards from NASA included the NASA Space Flight Medal in 1985, 1991 and 1993; the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1988 and 1992, and the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1994. She was inducted into the Tennessee Aviation Hall of Fame in 2005, and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame and Tennessee Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2017 she was named as one of the University of Tennessee Centennial Top100 Alumni and was a co-recipient of the Great American leadership award along with Gibson.

<text>Jeffrey Alan Hoffman (born November 2, 1944) is an American former NASA astronaut and currently a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.

Hoffman made five flights as a Space Shuttle astronaut, including the first mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993, when the orbiting telescope&#x27;s flawed optical system was corrected. Trained as an astrophysicist, he also flew on the 1990 Spacelab Shuttle mission that featured the Astro-1 ultraviolet astronomical observatory in the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay. Over the course of his five missions he logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space. He was also NASA&#x27;s second Jewish astronaut, and the second Jewish man in space after Soviet cosmonaut Boris Volynov.

==Background==
Hoffman was born November 2, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York, but considers Scarsdale, New York, to be his hometown. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1962, received a BA degree (summa cum laude) in astronomy from Amherst College in 1966, a PhD degree in astrophysics from Harvard University in 1971, and an MSc degree in materials science from Rice University in 1988. Hoffman is an Eagle Scout.

Hoffman is a member of the International Academy of Astronautics, the International Astronomical Union, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Astronomical Society, the Spanish Academy of Engineering, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.

 he is co-director of the Massachusetts Space Grant Consortium and a professor of the Practice in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT.

==Academic experience==
Hoffman&#x27;s original research interests were in high-energy astrophysics, specifically cosmic gamma ray and x-ray astronomy. His doctoral work at Harvard was the design, construction, testing, and flight of a balloon-borne, low-energy, gamma ray telescope.

From 1972 to 1975, during post-doctoral work at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, he worked on several x-ray astronomy rocket payloads. He also designed and supervised the construction and testing of the test equipment for use in an x-ray beam facility which he used to measure the scattering and reflectivity properties of x-ray concentrating mirrors. During his last year at Leicester, he was project scientist for the medium-energy x-ray experiment on the European Space Agency&#x27;s EXOSAT satellite and played a leading role in the proposal and design studies for this project.

He worked in the Center for Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1975 to 1978 as project scientist in charge of the orbiting HEAO-1 A4 hard x-ray and gamma ray experiment, launched in August 1977. 
His involvement included pre-launch design of the data analysis system, supervising its operation post-launch, and directing the MIT team undertaking the scientific analysis of flight data being returned. He was also involved extensively in analysis of x-ray data from the SAS-3 satellite being operated by MIT. His principal research was the study of x-ray bursts, about which he authored or co-authored more than 20 papers.

He joined the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics faculty in 2001 as a senior lecturer, and since 2002 has been a professor of the Practice in that department. His research specialties include human space flight operations, space flight technology, human-machine interactions, extravehicular activity, and conducting laboratory research in space. His teaching interests include space systems design and space policy. Dr. Hoffman instructed a course in systems engineering on the space shuttle that is available for free in video format from academic earth.

==NASA experience==
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Hoffman became an astronaut in August 1979. During preparations for the Shuttle Orbital Flight Tests, he worked in the Flight Simulation Laboratory at Downey, California, testing guidance, navigation and flight control systems. He worked with the orbital maneuvering and reaction control systems, with Shuttle navigation, with crew training, and with the development of satellite deployment procedures. Hoffman served as a support crewmember for STS-5 and as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for the STS-8 and STS-82 missions. He also worked on EVA, including the development of a high-pressure spacesuit, and preparations for the assembly of the Space Station. Hoffman was a co-founder of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group. In 1996 he led the Payload and Habitability Branch of the Astronaut Office.

Among the Jewish items he took into space were a Dreidel, which he spun for an hour, a Mezuzah, which he attached to the space station bunk bed he and fellow Jewish astronaut Scott J. Horowitz alternately used, and a Hanukkah menorah.

Hoffman left the astronaut program in July 1997 to become NASA&#x27;s European Representative in Paris, where he served until August 2001. His principal duties were to keep NASA and NASA&#x27;s European partners informed about each other&#x27;s activities, try to resolve problems in US-European cooperative space projects, search for new areas of US-European space cooperation, and represent NASA in European media. In August 2001, Hoffman was seconded by NASA to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is engaged in several research projects using the International Space Station and teaches courses on space operations and design.

==Space flight experience==

* STS 51-D (April 12–19, 1985)
* STS-35 (December 2–10, 1990)
* STS-46 (July 31 – August 8, 1992)
* STS-61 (December 2–13, 1993)
* STS-75 (February 22 – March 9, 1996)

Hoffman made his first space flight as a mission specialist on STS 51-D, April 12–19, 1985, on the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. On this mission, he made the first STS contingency spacewalk, in an attempted rescue of a malfunctioning satellite.

Hoffman made his second space flight as a mission specialist on STS-35, December 2–10, 1990, on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. This Spacelab mission featured the ASTRO-1 ultraviolet astronomy laboratory, a project on which Hoffman had worked since 1982.

Hoffman made his third space flight as payload commander and mission specialist on STS-46, July 31 – August 8, 1992, on the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. On this mission, the crew deployed the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), an ESA-sponsored free-flying science platform, and carried out the first test flight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS), a joint project between NASA and the Italian Space Agency. Hoffman had worked on the Tethered Satellite project since 1987.

Hoffman made his fourth flight as an EVA crewmember on STS-61, December 2–13, 1993, on the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. During this flight, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was captured, serviced, and restored to full capacity through a record five spacewalks by four astronauts, including Hoffman. Hoffman also spun a dreidel for the holiday of Hanukkah to a live audience watching via satellite.

Hoffman last flew on STS-75 (February 22 – March 9, 1996) on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. This was a 16-day mission whose principal payloads were the reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and the third flight of the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3). The TSS successfully demonstrated the ability of tethers to produce electricity. The TSS experiment produced a wealth of new information on the electrodynamics of tethers and plasma physics before the tether broke at 19.7 km, just shy of the 20.7 km goal. The crew also worked around the clock performing combustion experiments and research related to USMP-3 microgravity investigations. During this mission, Hoffman became the first astronaut to log 1000 hours aboard the Space Shuttle. Hoffman took with him a small Torah scroll, and he read from the Book of Genesis during the flight. The documentary film &quot;Space Torah&quot; released in 2023, is centered around this event.

With the completion of his fifth space flight, Dr. Hoffman has logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space.

==After NASA==
Since 2002, he has been a professor of the Practice in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Since 2008 he has also been a visiting professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester.

He is the author of a book titled &quot;An Astronaut&#x27;s Diary&quot; (June 1986) which is accompanied by a cassette tape. The audio tape contains excerpts of the original recordings he made with a pocket tape recorder.

Hoffman is a visiting lecturer at the International Space University.

<text>Jan Sterling (born Jane Sterling Adriance; April 3, 1921 – March 26, 2004) was an American film, television and stage actress. At her most active in films during the 1950s (immediately prior to which she had joined the Actors Studio), Sterling received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954) as well as an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. Her best performance is often considered to be opposite Kirk Douglas, as the opportunistic wife in Billy Wilder&#x27;s 1951 &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot;. Although her career declined during the 1960s, she continued to play occasional television and theatre roles. 

==Early life==
Sterling was born in New York City, the daughter of Eleanor Ward (née Deans) and William Allen Adriance Jr, an architect and advertising executive. She had a younger sister, Ann &quot;Mimi&quot; Adriance, a model and businesswoman. Jane grew up in a wealthy household and attended private schools before moving with her family to Europe and South America. In London and Paris she was schooled by private tutors, and in London she attended Fay Compton&#x27;s dramatic school. During the taping of the pilot of a game show in 1968, she told the story of having been sent airfare to fly back to the United States; seeing some lingerie she liked in a shop window, she used the last of her money to buy it, then traded in the airfare and booked aboard a steamship. Midway through the voyage, she found out that the airship she had originally been booked on, the , had been destroyed in a massive fire upon arriving in New Jersey on May 6, 1937.

==Acting career==

As a teenager, she returned to the borough of Manhattan, and using variations of her given name, including &quot;Jane Adriance&quot; and &quot;Jane Sterling&quot;, she began her acting career in 1938 by performing on Broadway as the character Chris Faringdon in &quot;Bachelor Born&quot;. For the summer of 1939, Sterling appeared in the summer stock cast at Elitch Theatre, the oldest Summer stock theater in the country, with Jane Wyatt appearing as the season&#x27;s leading lady.

She then appeared in a variety of other Broadway productions during the 1940s, such as &quot;When We Were Married&quot;, &quot;This Rock&quot;, and &quot;The Rugged Path&quot;. In 1947, she made her film debut in &quot;Tycoon&quot;, billed as Jane Darian. Ruth Gordon reportedly insisted she change her stage name, and they agreed upon Jan Sterling. She played a prominent supporting role in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948). Alternating between films and television, Sterling appeared in several television anthology series during the 1950s, and played film roles in &quot;Caged&quot; (1950), &quot;Mystery Street&quot; (1950), &quot;Union Station&quot; (1950), &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1951), &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (1951), &quot;Flesh and Fury&quot; (1952), &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954), &quot;Female on the Beach&quot; (1955), and &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958). Often cast as hard and determined characters, she played a sympathetic character in &quot;Sky Full of Moon&quot; (1952). In 1950, she was cast as Ruth (the girlfriend of Deputy Roscoe, played by veteran western film star Roscoe Ates) on &quot;The Marshal of Gunsight Pass&quot;.

In 1954, Sterling was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;. Later that year, she travelled to Britain to play the role of Julia in the 1956 version of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; despite being several months pregnant at the time. During the following years, she appeared regularly in films. Some of her appearances on American television series include the title character in &quot;The Annie Griffith Story&quot; on &quot;Wagon Train&quot; in 1959 and &quot;The Selena Hartnell Story&quot; in 1961; and during the 1960s, guest-starring role on &quot;Riverboat&quot;, her performance as Dianne Jordan in a 1960 &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode (&quot;The Blood Line&quot;), her portrayal of Nurse Murdoch in the 1963 episode &quot;Millions of Faces&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, and her performance in the 1967 episode &quot;Eleven Miles to Eden&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Road West&quot;. In late 1968, Sterling began portraying the conniving Miss Foss on &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;. After performing in the 1969 film &quot;The Minx&quot;, she curtailed her appearances in films and on television but continued to work on stage. She did, however, return to television in 1979 to portray the wife of President Herbert Hoover in &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot;, and in 1981, Sterling made her last film appearance playing Walter Matthau&#x27;s wife in the &quot;First Monday in October&quot;.

==Marriages==
Sterling was married twice. In 1941 she wed actor John Merivale, a union that ended in divorce seven years later. She then married actor Paul Douglas in 1950 and remained with him until his death in 1959. In the 1970s, she entered into a long-lasting personal relationship with Sam Wanamaker, who was based predominantly in the United Kingdom. Inactive professionally for nearly two decades, she made an appearance at the Cinecon Film Festival in Los Angeles in 2001.

==Health and death==
Sterling&#x27;s later life was marked by illness and injury that included diabetes, a broken hip, and a series of strokes. Her son died of heart failure in December 2003 aged 48. Sterling died three months later, on March 26, 2004, aged 82, at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

<text>Aloysius de Gonzaga, SJ (; 9 March 156821 June 1591) was an Italian aristocrat who became a member of the Society of Jesus. While still a student at the Roman College, he died as a result of caring for the victims of a serious epidemic. He was beatified in 1605 and canonized in 1726.

==Early life==

Gonzaga was born the eldest of eight children, at his family&#x27;s castle in Castiglione delle Stiviere, between Brescia and Mantua in northern Italy in what was then part of the Duchy of Mantua, into a cadet branch of the illustrious House of Gonzaga. &quot;Aloysius&quot; is the Latin form of his given name in Italian, &quot;Luigi&quot;. Gonzaga was the son of Ferrante Gonzaga, Marquess of Castiglione, and Dona Marta Tana di Santena, daughter of a baron of the Piedmontese Della Rovere family. His mother was a lady-in-waiting to Isabel, the wife of Philip II of Spain.

As the first-born son, he was in line to inherit his father&#x27;s title and status of Marquis. His father assumed that Gonzaga would become a soldier, as that was the norm for sons of the aristocracy and the family was often involved in the minor wars of the period. As early as age four, Luigi was given a set of miniature guns and accompanied his father on training expeditions so that the boy might learn &quot;the art of arms&quot;. At age five, Gonzaga was sent to a military camp to get started on his training. His father was pleased to see his son marching around camp at the head of a platoon of soldiers. His mother and his tutor were less pleased with the vocabulary he picked up there.

He grew up amid the violence and intrigue of Renaissance Italy.
In 1576, at age 8, he was sent to Florence along with his younger brother, Rodolfo, to serve at the court of the Grand Duke Francesco I de&#x27; Medici and to receive further education. While there, he fell ill with a disease of the kidneys, which troubled him throughout his life. While he was ill, he took the opportunity to read about the saints and to spend much of his time in prayer. In November 1579, the brothers were sent to the Duke of Mantua. Gonzaga was shocked by the violent and frivolous lifestyle he encountered there.

Gonzaga returned to Castiglione where he met Cardinal Charles Borromeo, and from him received First Communion on 22 July 1580. After reading a book about Jesuit missionaries in India, Gonzaga felt strongly that he wanted to become a missionary. He started practicing by teaching catechism classes to young boys in Castiglione in the summers. He also repeatedly visited the houses of the Capuchin friars and the Barnabites located in Casale Monferrato, the capital of the Gonzaga-ruled Duchy of Montferrat where the family spent the winter. He also adopted an ascetic lifestyle.

The family was called to Spain in 1581 to assist Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress. They arrived in Madrid in March 1582, where Gonzaga and Rodolfo became pages for the young Infante Diego. Gonzaga started thinking in earnest about joining a religious order. He had considered joining the Capuchins, but he had a Jesuit confessor in Madrid and decided instead to join that order. His mother agreed to his request, but his father was furious and prevented him from doing so.

In July 1584, a year and a half after the Infante&#x27;s death, the family returned to Italy. Gonzaga still wanted to become a priest, but several members of his family worked hard to persuade him to change his mind. When they realized there was no way to make him give up his plan, they tried to persuade him to become a secular priest and offered to arrange for a bishopric for him. If he were to become a Jesuit he would renounce any right to his inheritance or status in society. His family&#x27;s attempts to dissuade him failed; Gonzaga was not interested in higher office and still wanted to become a missionary.

==Religious life==

In November 1585, Gonzaga gave up all rights of inheritance, which was confirmed by the emperor. He went to Rome and, because of his noble birth, gained an audience with Pope Sixtus V. Following a brief stay at the Palazzo Aragona Gonzaga, the Roman home of his cousin, Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga, on 25 November 1585 he was accepted into the Society of Jesus in Rome. During this period, he was asked to moderate his asceticism somewhat and to be more social with the other novices.

Gonzaga&#x27;s health continued to cause problems. He was sent to Milan for studies, but was sent back to Rome after some time because of his health. On 25 November 1587, he took the three religious vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. In February and March 1588, he received minor orders and started studying theology to prepare for ordination. In 1589, he was called to Mantua to mediate between his brother Rodolfo and the Duke of Mantua. He returned to Rome in May 1590. It is said that, later that year, he had a vision in which the Archangel Gabriel told him that he would die within a year.

In 1591, a plague broke out in Rome. The Jesuits opened a hospital for the stricken, and Gonzaga volunteered to work there. After begging alms for the victims, Gonzaga began working with the sick, carrying the dying from the streets into a hospital founded by the Jesuits. There he washed and fed the plague victims, preparing them as best he could to receive the sacraments. But though he threw himself into his tasks, he privately confessed to his spiritual director, Robert Bellarmine, that his constitution was revolted by the sights and smells of the work; he had to work hard to overcome his physical repulsion.

At the time, many of the younger Jesuits had become infected with the disease, and so Gonzaga&#x27;s superiors forbade him from returning to the hospital. But Gonzaga—long accustomed to refusals from his father—persisted and requested permission to return, which was granted. Eventually he was allowed to care for the sick, but only at another hospital, called Our Lady of Consolation, where those with contagious diseases were not admitted. While there, Gonzaga was infected. He grew ill and was bedridden by 3 March 1591, a few days before his 23rd birthday.

Gonzaga declined for many weeks. It seemed certain that he would die in a short time, and he was given Extreme Unction. He spoke several times with his confessor, the cardinal and later saint, Robert Bellarmine. Gonzaga told several people that he would die on the Octave of the feast of Corpus Christi. On that day, 21 June 1591, as he began to grow weak, Bellarmine gave him the last rites. He died just before midnight.

==Veneration==
Gonzaga was buried in the Church of the Most Holy Annunciation, which later became the Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola (Sant&#x27;Ignazio) in Rome. His name was changed to &quot;Robert&quot; before his death, in honor of his confessor. Many people considered him to be a saint soon after his death, and his remains were moved into the Sant&#x27;Ignazio church, where they now rest in an urn of lapis lazuli in the Lancellotti Chapel. His head was later translated to the sanctuary-basilica bearing his name (elevated to Minor Basilica by Pope Paul VI in 1964) in Castiglione delle Stiviere. He was beatified by Pope Paul V on 19 October 1605—only fourteen years after the Saint&#x27;s death—and then canonized together with another Jesuit novice, Stanislaus Kostka, by Pope Benedict XIII on 31 December 1726.
Purity was his notable virtue. The Carmelite mystic, Mary Magdalene de&#x27; Pazzi, claimed to have had a vision of him on 4 April 1600. She described him as radiant in glory because of his &quot;interior works,&quot; a hidden martyr for his great love of God.

Saint Aloysius&#x27; feast day is celebrated on 21 June, the date of his death.

=== Patronage ===

In 1729, Pope Benedict XIII declared Aloysius de Gonzaga to be the patron saint of youth and students, placing all schools under the patronage of the Saint. In 1926, he was named patron of all Christian youth by Pope Pius XI. Owing to the manner of his death, he has been considered a patron saint of plague victims. For his compassion and courage in the face of an incurable disease, St. Aloysius Gonzaga has become the patron both of AIDS patients and their caregivers. Gonzaga is also the patron of Valmontone, a town in Lazio.

Aloysius Gonzaga is also celebrated in a small south Italy town called Alezio, as a patron of the town, celebrated on June 21.

Being the patron saint of youth and students and because of his service to others as a young adult, several schools and colleges are named after Aloysius Gonzaga. Mount Aloysius College in Cresson, Pennsylvania and
Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, are a few examples.
=== Iconography ===
In art, Gonzaga is shown as a young man wearing a black cassock and surplice, or as a page. His attributes are a lily, referring to innocence; a cross, referring to piety and sacrifice; a skull, referring to his early death; and a rosary, referring to his devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Gelsenkirchen, the location of German soccer club Schalke 04, has a glass window of the saint with a soccer ball.
Gonzaga is represented on the ceiling of the Chapel of the Immaculate, at Collegio Rotondi, Italy, in the act of adoring Our Lady with her child Jesus.

==In popular culture==
Irish writer James Joyce, being educated at the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College, chose Aloysius Gonzaga as his confirmation saint.

<text>Stanley David Griggs (September 7, 1939 – June 17, 1989) was a United States Navy officer and a NASA astronaut. He is credited with conducting the first unscheduled extra-vehicular activity of the space program during Space Shuttle mission STS-51-D. Griggs was killed when the vintage World War II-era training aircraft he was piloting – a North American AT-6D (registration N3931S) – crashed near Earle, Arkansas.

==Early life==
Born September 7, 1939, in Portland, Oregon, Griggs graduated from Lincoln High School in his hometown in 1957. He was an Eagle Scout. In 1962 he received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy and in 1970 a Master of Science degree in Administration from George Washington University. He enjoyed flying, auto restoration, running, skiing, and diving. He married Karen Frances Kreeb and they had two daughters together, Alison Marie (August 21, 1971) and Carre Anne (May 14, 1974).

==Navy career==
Griggs graduated from Annapolis in 1962 and entered Naval pilot training shortly thereafter. In 1964, he received his United States Navy pilot wings and was attached to Attack Squadron-72 flying A-4 Skyhawks. He completed one Mediterranean cruise and two Southeast Asia combat cruises aboard the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Independence&quot; and USS &quot;Franklin Roosevelt&quot;.

In 1967 Griggs entered the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland and upon completion of test pilot training was assigned to the Flying Qualities and Performance Branch, Flight Test Division, where he flew various test projects on fighter and attack-type aircraft. In 1970, he resigned his regular United States Navy commission and affiliated with the Naval Air Reserve in which he achieved the rank of Rear Admiral.

As a Naval Reservist, Griggs was assigned to several fighter and attack squadrons flying A-4 Skyhawk, A-7 Corsair II and F-8 Crusader aircraft based at Naval Air Stations in New Orleans, Louisiana and Miramar, California.

He logged 9,500 hours flying time, 7,800 hours in jet aircraft, and flew over 45 different types of aircraft including single and multi engine prop, turboprop and jet aircraft, helicopters, gliders, hot air balloons and the Space Shuttle. He made over 300 aircraft carrier landings, held an Airline Transport Pilot License, and was a certified flight instructor.

==NASA career==

In July 1970, Griggs was employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center as a research pilot, working on various flight test and research projects in support of NASA programs. In 1974, he was assigned duties as the project pilot for the Space Shuttle trainer aircraft and participated in the design, development, and testing of those aircraft pending their operational deployment in 1976. He was appointed Chief of the Shuttle Training Aircraft Operations Office in January 1976 with responsibility for the operational use of the shuttle trainer, and held that position until being selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. In August 1979, he completed a one-year training and evaluation period and became eligible for Space Shuttle flight crew assignment.

From 1979 to 1983, Griggs was involved in several Space Shuttle engineering capacities including the development and testing of the Head-Up Display (HUD) approach and landing avionics system, development of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and the requirements definition and verification of on-orbit rendezvous and entry flight phase software and procedures. In September 1983 he began crew training as a mission specialist for flight STS-51-D, which flew April 12–19, 1985. During the flight, Griggs conducted the first unscheduled extravehicular activity (space walk) of the space program. The space walk lasted for over three hours during which preparations for a satellite rescue attempt were completed.

At the time of his death, Griggs was in flight crew training as pilot for STS-33, a dedicated Department of Defense mission, scheduled for launch in November 1989. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="557534" wikidata="Q3048146" url="?curid=557534" title="Edmund Walker Head">
<text>Sir Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet, KCB (16 February 1805 – 28 January 1868) was a 19th-century British politician and diplomat.

==Early life and scholarship==

Head was born at Wiarton Place, near Maidstone, Kent, the son of the Reverend Sir John Head, 7th Bt. and Jane (née Walker) Head. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s title in 1838.

He was educated at Winchester College and Oriel College, Oxford, and in 1830 he was made a Fellow of Merton College. He was an Oxford scholar and tutor who published several books, including a book on the verbs &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;. In 1866, Head published &quot;The Story of Viga Glum&quot;, which he had translated from the original Icelandic. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863.

==Government service==
In 1847, Head was appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick (1847–1854).

While Lieutenant Governor, Head authorized the creation of an engineering faculty at the University of New Brunswick (UNB). This was the first such programme in what would become Canada.

In 1854, Head was appointed Governor General of the Province of Canada. He served until 1861. During his time in office, there was some controversy over his refusal to grant a dissolution to the Reform ministry at the time of the &quot;Double Shuffle&quot;.

He was appointed a Privy Councillor in 1857, and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1860.

Head died in London in 1868.

==Family==

He had married Anna Maria Yorke, daughter of Reverend Philip Yorke Prebendary of Ely, and his wife, Hon. Anna Maria Cocks, daughter of John Cocks, 1st Earl Somers, on 27 November 1838. Anna Maria was born in 1808. The couple had three children. Their son accidentally drowned in Quebec&#x27;s Saint-Maurice River in September 1859. One of their two daughters was born at Fredericton, New Brunswick on 6 February 1849.

Anna Maria was an artist, who sketched a picture of the view from Major&#x27;s Hill, Ottawa, Ontario which she subsequently presented to Queen Victoria. Within a month or two after this event Her Majesty chose Ottawa as the seat of Government of United Canada. Lady Head volunteered and bestowed alms among the poor. A memorial of her Ladyship&#x27;s visit to the Upper Ottawa, in a bark canoe, in 1856, stands at Portage-du-Fort, Quebec. In the county of Renfrew, a township Maria, was named in her honour. Lady Head died at Oak Lea, Shere, Guildford, England, 25 August 1890.
==Legacy==
* Sir Edmund Head Hall is the name of the engineering building at the University of New Brunswick.
* Edmundston, New Brunswick, is named after him. 
* The united township of Head, Clara and Maria in Renfrew County, Ontario was named in honour of Head and his wife.
* Mount Head in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta is named after him.

<text>Prohibitory [[traffic sign]]s are used to prohibit certain types of manoeuvres or some types of traffic.

==Modern prohibitory traffic signs==

===No entry===
No admittance to unauthorised personnel, usually shown as a red circle with a white rectangle across its face. It is often used for one-way traffic.
====Wrong way====
These signs denote that the road is only for traffic coming in the opposite direction. Used at intersections to roads with one-way traffic or ramps.
====Road closed====
No admittance for vehicles. It is used on closed roads.
====No straight ahead====
Traffic is not permitted to continue straight, and must usually turn. These may occur at an intersection with incoming one-way traffic.

===No motor vehicles===
Motor vehicles are not permitted in this region.
===No motorcycles===
Motorcycles are not permitted in this area.
===No heavy goods vehicles===
Heavy goods vehicles are not allowed.
===No buses===
Buses are not permitted.
===No pedestrians===
Pedestrians are not allowed on the road, but may use a footpath instead.
===No bicycles===
===No pedestrians or bicycles===
Pedestrians and bicycles are not permitted, but may be allowed on a footpath.
===No right, left, or U-turn===
Either for all vehicles or with some exceptions (emergency vehicles, buses). These are usually to speed up traffic through an intersection or due to street cars or other rights of way or if the intersecting road is one-way. Indicated near-universally by an arrow making the prohibited turn overlaid with a red circle with an angular line crossing it.

====No right turn signs====
====No left turn signs====
====No turn signs====
====No U-turn signs====
====No left or U-turn signs====

====No right or U-turn signs====

====Other turn prohibition signs====
===No overtaking===
Overtaking is prohibited either for all vehicles or for certain kinds of vehicles only (e.g. lorries, motorcycles). In the USA, this is usually phrased as &quot;no passing zone&quot; and indicated by a rectangular, black-on-white sign on the right side of the road that says &quot;DO NOT PASS&quot;, and/or by a solid yellow line painted on the roadway marking the left limit of traffic (centerline), and sometimes supplemented by a yellow (no passing zone) sign on the opposite side of the road (where it can be seen by a driver who is attempting to pass). Conversely, where the passing restriction is lifted, a rectangular, black-on-white sign that says &quot;PASS WITH CARE&quot; is placed on the right side of the road, and/or the yellow centerline changes from solid to broken (indicating that passing is allowed in that direction).

====No overtaking or passing signs====
====End of overtaking signs====
===Limits===

====Speed limits====

Used to indicate a maximum permissible speed. Speed limits are posted in kilometres per hour in most countries; however, the United Kingdom and United States use miles per hour. Motorists are expected to be aware of this, as the majority of speed limit signs display only a number and no specific units, although some countries&#x27; signs do display the unit as well. In Canada, the first sign in a sequence will display km/h and subsequent signs often will omit the unit.

=====Speed limit signs=====
=====End of speed limit=====
Used to denote that a previously posted speed limit is no longer in effect. Statutory state, local, or national speed limits usually govern speed after this point, unless another limit is signposted.
====Weight limits====
Used to denote maximum weight for bridges.
====Width limits====
Used to denote maximum width on narrow roadways.
====Height limits====
Used to denote height limit on bridges and underpasses.
====Length limits====
Used to denote maximum length.
===No horns===
Sounding vehicle horns is not allowed for vehicles in some areas, most commonly in school zones, villages, or near hospitals or churches.
===No parking===
This sign is used where parking is prohibited. Usually shown as a red diagonal bar inside a blue circle with a red ring in Europe and parts of Asia, and a &#x27;P&#x27; in a red circle with a cross through in North and South America, elsewhere in Asia, Australia, Africa and Ireland. The &quot;no parking&quot; sign is a part of controlled parking zone sign, which is obsolete in Belgrade from 1997.
===No stopping===
This sign is used where parking and stopping is prohibited. Usually shown as a red cross inside a blue circle with a red ring in Europe and parts of Asia, and a &#x27;E&#x27; in a red circle with a X through in South America.

<text>Edwin Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Garn (born October 12, 1932) is an American politician from Utah. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the United States Senate from 1974 to 1993. Garn became the first sitting member of the United States Congress of either chamber to fly in space when he flew aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; as a payload specialist during NASA mission STS-51-D (April 12–19, 1985). Prior to his time in Congress, he served as the mayor of Salt Lake City.

==Early life and education==
Garn was born in Richfield, Utah and the son of World War I pilot Ed Garn and the former Agnes Fern Christensen. He is of Danish and German descent. He attended East High School, Clayton Middle School, and Uintah Elementary School. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business and finance from the University of Utah in 1955, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Career==
Senator Garn is a former insurance executive. He served in the United States Navy as a Martin P5M Marlin pilot. He also served as a pilot of the 151st Air Refueling Group of the Utah Air National Guard, where he flew the Boeing KC-97L and KC-135A. He retired as a colonel in April 1979. He was promoted to brigadier general after his Space Shuttle mission. He had flown 17,000 hours in military aircraft when he flew in space.

Before his election to the Senate, Garn served on the Salt Lake City commission for four years and was elected as the mayor of Salt Lake City in 1971, entering office in 1972. He was the last Republican to hold that office to date. Garn was active in the Utah League of Cities and Towns and served as its president in 1972. In 1974, Garn was the first vice-president of the National League of Cities, and he served as its honorary president in 1975.

Garn was first elected to the Senate in 1974, succeeding retiring Republican Wallace F. Bennett, father of later Senator (and his eventual successor) Bob Bennett. Garn was re-elected to a second term in November 1980 with 74 percent of the vote, the largest victory in a statewide race in Utah history. Garn was re-elected a second time in 1986.

Though strongly anti-abortion, Garn joined United States House of Representatives member Henry Hyde of Illinois in resigning from the board of the United States anti-abortion movement when the executive director of the organization, Peter Gemma, issued a &quot;hit list&quot; to target certain lawmakers who supported abortion rights. Garn and Hyde, the author of the Hyde Amendment, which limited abortions financed by Medicaid, said that &quot;hit lists&quot; are counterproductive because they create irrevocable discord among legislators, any of whom can be subject to a &quot;single issue&quot; attack of this kind by one advocacy group or another. Gemma said that he was surprised by the withdrawal of Garn and Hyde from the PAC committee but continued with plans to spend $650,000 for the 1982 elections on behalf of anti-abortion candidates.

Garn was chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and served on three subcommittees: Housing and Urban Affairs, Financial Institutions, and International Finance and Monetary Policy. He also was a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and served as chairman of the HUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee. He served on four other Appropriations subcommittees: Energy and Water Resources, Defense, Military Construction, and Interior. Garn served as a member of the Republican leadership from 1979 to 1984 as secretary of the Republican Conference.

His Institute of Finance has been called a &quot;hot tub of influence peddling&quot;.

Garn retired from the Senate in 1992. He is a supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

==Savings and loan==
As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Garn was co-author of the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the law that partially deregulated the savings and loan industry and attempted to forestall the looming Savings and loan crisis.

==Spaceflight==
Garn asked to fly on the Space Shuttle because he was head of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that dealt with NASA, and had extensive aviation experience. He had previously flown a Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit prototype and driven a new Army tank. He began publicly asking NASA about flying on the Shuttle in 1981, and the agency had long planned to fly &quot;citizen passengers&quot; such as artists, journalists, entertainers, and the Teacher in Space Project, but the November 1984 announcement that a member of Congress would go to space surprised most observers. Garn said that flying on the Shuttle would be a fact-finding trip: &quot;I do really think that it is a necessity that Congressmen check things out that they vote for and make certain that funds are being spent adequately. It might be necessary to have a Senator kick the tire&quot;.

STS-51-D was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center in the U.S. state Florida in April 1985. Its primary objective was to deploy two communications satellites, and to perform electrophoresis and echocardiograph operations in space in addition to a number of other experiments. As a payload specialist, Garn&#x27;s role on the mission was as a congressional observer and as a subject for medical experiments on space adaptation syndrome. At the conclusion of the mission, Garn had traveled over in 108 Earth orbits, logging over 167 hours in space.

The space sickness Garn experienced during the journey was so severe that a scale for space sickness was jokingly based on him, where &quot;one Garn&quot; is the highest possible level of sickness. Some NASA astronauts who opposed the payload specialist program, such as Mike Mullane, believed that Garn&#x27;s space sickness was evidence of the inappropriateness of flying people with little training. Garn was in excellent physical condition, however, and began flying at the age of 16. Astronaut Charles Bolden described Garn as &quot;the ideal candidate to do it, because he was a veteran Navy combat pilot who had more flight hours than anyone in the Astronaut Office&quot;. Fellow 51-D payload specialist Charles Walker—who also suffered from space sickness on the flight despite having flown before—stated that:

The Jake Garn Mission Simulator and Training Facility, NASA&#x27;s prime training facility for astronauts in the Shuttle and Space Station programs, is named after him.

Upon his return, he co-wrote the 1989 novel &quot;Night Launch&quot;. The book centers around terrorists taking control of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during the first NASA–USSR Space Shuttle flight.

==Personal life==
Garn first married Hazel Rhae Thompson on February 2, 1957 in the town of Biloxi, Mississippi. Together, they had four children: Jacob, Susan, Ellen, and Jeffrey. Hazel died in an automobile accident in Cheyenne County, Nebraska, on August 17, 1976. On April 8, 1977, he married Kathleen Brewerton, who had a son, Brook, from a previous marriage at Salt Lake Temple. Jake and Kathleen had two children together, Matthew and Jennifer. Kathleen died on May 31, 2018. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In 1986, Garn donated a kidney to his 27-year-old daughter, Susan, who was experiencing progressive kidney failure as a result of diabetes.

<text>Karl Leberecht Immermann (24 April 1796 – 25 August 1840) was a German dramatist, novelist and poet.

==Biography==
He was born at Magdeburg, the son of a government official. In 1813 he went to study law at Halle, where he remained, after the suppression of the university by Napoleon in the same year, until Frederick William III of Prussia&#x27;s &quot;Summons to my people&quot; on 17 March. Immermann responded quickly, but was prevented by illness from taking part in the earlier campaign; he fought, however, in 1815 at Ligny and Waterloo, and marched into Paris with Blücher.

At the conclusion of the war, he resumed his studies at Halle, and after being &quot;Referendar&quot; in Magdeburg, was appointed in 1819 &quot;Assessor&quot; at Münster in Westphalia. Here he made the acquaintance of Elise von Lützow, Countess von Ahlefeldt, wife of Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm Freiherr von Lützow. She inspired him to begin writing, and their relationship is reflected in several dramas written about this time.

In 1823, Immermann was appointed judge at Magdeburg, and in 1827 was transferred to Düsseldorf as &quot;Landgerichtsrat&quot; or district judge. The countess, whose marriage had in the meantime been dissolved, followed him, and, though refusing marriage, shared his home until 1839, when he married a granddaughter of August Hermann Niemeyer (1754–1828), chancellor and &quot;rector perpetuus&quot; of Halle University. In 1834 Immermann undertook the management of the Düsseldorf theatre, and, although his resources were small, succeeded for two years in raising it to a high level of excellence. The theatre, however, was insufficiently endowed to allow of him carrying on the work, and In 1836 he returned to his official duties and literary pursuits. He died at Düsseldorf.

Immermann had considerable aptitude for the drama, but it was long before he found a congenial field for his talents. His early plays are imitations, partly of Kotzebue&#x27;s, partly of the Romantic dramas of Ludwig Tieck and Müller, and are now forgotten. In 1826, however, appeared &quot;Cardenio und Celinde&quot;, a love tragedy of more promise; this, as well as the earlier productions, awakened the ill-will of Count Platen, who made Immermann the subject of his wittiest satire, &quot;Der romantische Oedipus&quot;. Between 1827 and 1832 Immermann redeemed his good name by a series of historical tragedies, &quot;Das Trauerspiel in Tirol&quot; (1827), &quot;Kaiser Friedrich II.&quot; (1828) and a trilogy from Russian history, &quot;Alexis&quot; (1832). His masterpiece is the poetic mystery, &quot;Merlin&quot; (1831), a noble poem, which, like its model, &quot;Faust&quot;, deals with the deeper problems of modern spiritual life.

Immermann&#x27;s important dramaturgic experiments in Düsseldorf are described in detail in &quot;Düsseldorfer Anfänge&quot; (1840). More significant is his position as a novelist. Here he clearly stands on the boundary line between Romanticism and modern literature; his &quot;Epigonen&quot; (1836) might be described as one of the last Romantic imitations of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, while the satire and realism of his second novel, &quot;Münchhausen&quot; (1838), form a complete break with the older literature.

As a prose-writer Immermann is perhaps best remembered to-day by his story of village life, &quot;Der Oberhof&quot;, which is embedded in the formless mass of &quot;Münchhausen&quot;. His last work was an unfinished epic, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (1840).

Immermann&#x27;s &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; were published in 14 volumes in 1835–1843; a new edition, with biography and introduction by R. Boxberger, in 20 volumes (Berlin, 1883); selected works, edited by M. Koch, (4 volumes, 1887–1888) and Franz Muncker (6 volumes, 1897).

<text>Gordon Sidney Harrington (August 7, 1883 – July 4, 1943) was a Nova Scotia politician and the 11th premier of Nova Scotia from 1930 to 1933.

He was mayor of Glace Bay from 1913 to 1915 when he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force fighting in World War I. He was elected a Conservative MLA in 1925 representing Cape Breton Centre and his support from miners helped ensure the Conservative Party&#x27;s victory in that election. Harrington became Minister of Labour in the government of Edgar N. Rhodes and became Premier of Nova Scotia when Rhodes left provincial politics to enter the federal cabinet in 1930.

During Harrington&#x27;s term he was able to end ongoing labour disturbance among miners in Cape Breton which had afflicted the previous two premiers. He improved the provincial department of mining, fought for the coal and steel industries in Ottawa, and passed legislation calling for a national policy on coal and steel.

However, his government was unable to combat the Great Depression and was defeated by the Liberals in the 1933 election. Harrington remained in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly until 1937. His government was the last Conservative government until Robert Stanfield was able to take power in 1956.

<text>The County of Aumale, later elevated to a duchy, was a medieval fief in Normandy, disputed between France and England during parts of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

==Norman nobility==
Aumale was a medieval fief in the Duchy of Normandy and, after 1066, of the King of England.
According to Chisholm, the fief of Aumale was granted by the archbishop of Rouen to Odo, brother-in-law of William the Conqueror, who erected it into a countship.
Thompson wrote that it was given to Adelaide, William&#x27;s half-sister, as a dower by her first husband Enguerrand; it then passed &quot;jure uxoris&quot; to her second and third husbands, Lambert and Odo. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Adelaide is recorded as the Countess of Aumale, with holdings in Suffolk and Essex. In 1087 Odo received the Lordship of Holderness, and at some time before 1090 Adelaide&#x27;s holdings were passed to their son, Stephen. In 1102 the fief, with Odo&#x27;s lands in Holderness, passed to their son, Stephen.

===Lords===
Norman counts:
*Guerinfroi, lord before 996–?
*Guerinfroi Aymard (son) ?–1048
*Bertha of Aumale (daughter) 1048–1052
**Hugh II, Count of Ponthieu 1048–1052 (married to Bertha)
*Enguerrand I of Aumale (married Adelaide of Normandy, who retained the lordship after her husband&#x27;s death)
*Adelaide of Normandy 1053–1087 &quot;with&quot;
**Lambert of Boulogne 1053–1054 (married to Adelaide)

===Counts===
Anglo-Norman counts:

**William de Forz 1189–1194 
**Baldwin of Béthune 1195–1196 
*&quot;confiscated; to French royal domain. The English kings continued to recognise the title, as Earl of Albemarle&quot; (see English peerage section below)

==French nobility==
In 1196, Philip II of France captured the castle of Aumale, and granted the title of &quot;Count of Aumale&quot; to Renaud de Dammartin. It was later held by the houses of Castile, Harcourt, and Lorraine.
After several extinctions the title was re-created in 1547 for Francis, then styled Count of Aumale by courtesy. On his accession as Duke of Guise, he ceded it to his brother Claude, Duke of Aumale. It was later used as a title by Henri d&#x27;Orléans, the youngest son of Louis-Philippe, King of the French and Duke of Orléans.

, the titleholder is a grandson of the late Henri, Count of Paris, Orléans heir, and his wife, Princess Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza of Brazil. Prince Foulques, Duke of Aumale, son of Prince Jacques, Duke of Orléans and the duchess, née Gersende de Sabran-Pontèves, added it to his title of Comte d&#x27;Eu.

==English peerage==
Through the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the kings of England at various times ruled Aumale, through their claims to be dukes of Normandy and later, kings of France. The title of Count or Duke of Aumale was granted several times during this period.

===Earls (1095)===
In 1196, Philip II of France captured the castle of Aumale (and, subsequently, the remainder of Normandy). The kings of England continued to claim the Duchy of Normandy, and to recognize the old line of Counts or Earls of Aumale. These were:
* &quot;see above for Counts before 1196&quot;
* Hawise of Aumale, 2nd Countess of Aumale (died 1214), married, bef. 1196:
** Baldwin of Bethune (died 1212), Count of Aumale &quot;jure uxoris&quot;

* William de Forz, 3rd Earl of Albemarle (died 1242), son of the 2nd Countess by her second husband William de Forz (died 1195)
* William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle (died 1260), son of the 3rd Earl
* Thomas de Forz, 5th Earl of Albemarle (died 1269), son of the 4th Earl
* Aveline de Forz, Countess of Albemarle (died 1274), daughter of the 4th Earl

Aveline married Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1269, but she died without issue in 1274. A claim upon the inheritance by John de Eston (de Ashton) was settled in 1278 with the surrender of the earldom to the Crown.

===Dukes, first creation (1385)===
:&quot;also: Duke of Gloucester (1385–1397), Earl of Essex (1376–1397), Earl of Buckingham (1377)&quot;
*Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (died 1397), fifth son of Edward III, was created Duke of Aumale by writ of summons on 3 September 1385, but was also made Duke of Gloucester very soon after, and seems never to have used the former title. It was almost certainly forfeit upon his murder while awaiting trial for treason.
&quot;Note: This creation is not listed in several sources such as &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;, which indicates the creation shown below as the 1st.&quot;

===Dukes, second creation (1397)===
:&quot;also: Duke of York (1385), Earl of Cambridge (1362–1414), Earl of Rutland (1390–1402), Earl of Cork (c. 1396)&quot;
*Edward of Norwich, 1st Earl of Rutland (died 1415), first son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (himself fourth son of Edward III), was created Duke of Aumale shortly after Woodstock&#x27;s murder, but was deprived of the title by Henry IV Bolingbroke in 1399. Edward is referred to in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; as the &quot;Duke of Aumerle&quot;

===Earls (1412)===
:&quot;also: Duke of Clarence (1412)&quot;
*Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence (1387–1421), second son of Henry IV Bolingbroke, was created Earl of Aumale along with his dukedom of Clarence, and carried both titles until his death without issue.

===Counts (1422)===
:&quot;also: Earl of Warwick (1088)&quot;
*Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick (1382–1439), military commander under Henry V in France, was created Count of Aumale for life only.

In further creations in the English peerage after the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Aumale was spelled in the Latinised form Albemarle. For these, see &quot;Duke of Albemarle&quot; and &quot;Earl of Albemarle&quot;.

<text>Starnberg () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the southern part of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich, Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen, Weilheim-Schongau and Landsberg.

Starnberg district and the Hochtaunuskreis regularly compete for the title of Germany&#x27;s wealthiest district.

==Geography==
The main geographic feature of the district are the five lakes – the Starnberger See and Ammersee, as well as the smaller Weßlinger See, Wörthsee and Pilsensee. The lakes were formed by the glaciers of the last ice age. Hence the district is also called &quot;Fünf-Seen-Land&quot; (five-lake county).

==History==
The district was created in 1902, when the &quot;Bezirksamt München II&quot; was dissolved, and the new &quot;Bezirksamt Starnberg&quot; and &quot;Bezirksamt Wolfratshausen&quot; were created. Starting in 1939 they were called &quot;Landkreis&quot;. In 1972 two municipalities (Bachhausen and Höhenrain) from the district Wolfratshausen were added to the district. In the 1978 communal reform the previously 42 municipalities were merged into the current 14 ones.

==Partnerships==
Since 1982 the district has a partnership with the district Bad Dürkheim in Rhineland-Palatinate. Since 1981 it also has a partnership with the Taipei County (now New Taipei City), which developed after a delegation of parachutists from Taiwan stayed in Starnberg for the 1980 parachuting world championship in Altenstadt/Schongau.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show the Bavarian diamonds in the background, with a yellow lion and eagle in front. The two animals were the symbol of the Counts of Andechs-Meranien, who ruled the area until 1248.

<doc id="557573" wikidata="Q41976" url="?curid=557573" title="Dokkum">
<text>Dokkum is a Dutch fortified city in the municipality of Noardeast-Fryslân in the province of Friesland. It has 12,669 inhabitants (February 8, 2020). The fortifications of Dokkum are well preserved and are known as the &quot;bolwerken&quot; (bulwarks). It is the fifth most popular shopping city in Friesland. It also had the smallest hospital in the Netherlands. 

== History ==
The best-known event in Dokkum&#x27;s history is the martyrdom of the Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface in 754. Oliver of Cologne preached the Fifth Crusade in Dokkum in 1214 and Dokkum sent a contingent; the crescent in the coat of arms of Dokkum refers to this event. Dokkum acquired city rights in 1298. In 1572 Dokkum was sacked by the Spaniards after it had joined the Dutch Revolt. In 1597, the Admiralty of Friesland was established in Dokkum. However, it was moved to Harlingen in 1645. In 1971 the city was included in the list of Dutch &#x27;Urban and village conservation areas&#x27;.

In 1923, when Catholics in the Netherlands were not allowed to engage in public expressions of faith such as processions, a processional park was built south-east of the city center, the Boniface park. Central in the park is the so-called Brouwersbron, the brewers&#x27; well, which Titus Brandsma and others (incorrectly) identified as the well that sprang up after the saint&#x27;s martyrdom. A chapel dedicated to Boniface was built in 1934. Brandsma, a Carmelite priest who was murdered by the Nazis in Dachau in 1942, also designed the park&#x27;s Stations of the Cross, which were finished in 1949.

Before 2019, the city was part of the Dongeradeel municipality.

==Architecture==
===City hall===
The city hall in Dokkum was built in 1610.

===Churches===
* Grote of Sint-Martinuskerk which is from the 16th century.
* Sint-Bonifatiuskerk from 1871.
* Bonifatiuskapel is from 1934

== Transport ==
Dokkum had a station (&quot;Dokkum-Aalsum&quot;) on the North Friesland Railway, which opened in 1901. It became the terminus for passenger services in May 1935 and closed to passengers in July 1936. The station reopened to passengers in May 1940 and closed to passengers in July 1942. Freight services ceased in 1975. There is still a bus station in Dokkum.

== Urban development ==
The latest neighbourhood is called the &#x27;Trije Terpen&#x27;. At the Trije Terpen is also the newest shopping area of Dokkum called, Zuiderschans. Other construction works in other parts of the city are also taking place, such as the Lyceumpark, the Fonteinslanden, the Veiling and the Hogedijken.

In the future the industrial park, Betterwird, will expand even more to the west. It&#x27;s an industrial park with more than 70 companies. In 2013, the construction of the Central Axis began. This is a road with a fast connection and few obstacles between Dokkum and Drachten. The road was delivered in 2016.

=== Population ===
The population of Dokkum increased by 5,378 people between 1960 and 2013. In recent years, the population has fluctuated around 12,500 inhabitants.

== Sport ==
In the 200 km ice skating marathon known as the Elfstedentocht, Dokkum is known as the &quot;keerpunt&quot; (turning-point in Dutch), because it is where the speedskaters turn and head back to Leeuwarden. There are two different soccer clubs in Dokkum, VV Dokkum and Be Quick Dokkum.

==Windmills==
In 1652, Dokkum had five windmills, these were all post mills. Dokkum has two windmills, cap mills, that are preserved and both of them are open to the public by appointment. They are named &quot;Zeldenrust&quot; and &quot;De Hoop&quot;. A third mill, &quot;De Marmeerin&quot; stood by the Woudvaart outside the town. Since 2014 the mill was moved to be restored to working order. After restoration it is to be rebuilt at De sûkerei open-air museum in Damwâld.

<text>Salmonby is a village in the civil parish of Tetford, in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated north-east from Horncastle, south from Louth and north-west from Spilsby. Salmonby lies within the Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Tetford lies to the north-east and Somersby to the south.

The parish covers about , and contains a chalybeate spring, whose waters eventually join the Steeping River near Spilsby.

==History==
An upper palaeolithic core (a piece of flint which has been repeatedly used to flake material in order to make flint tools) was found near Salmonby. The core was in good condition and has been dated at 50,000 - 10,000 years old. The area was a source of blue phosphate of iron and a great deal of iron oxide ore.

Salmonby Church, dedicated to St Margaret, was a medieval construction, largely rebuilt in 1871. It was closed and deconsecrated in 1973, then demolished in 1978, with only a small wooden gate leading to the churchyard, and a few photographs, remaining:

In 1971 the civil parish had a population of 58. On 1 April 1987 the parish was abolished and merged with Tetford.

==Community==
The village has a public house, the Cross Keys Inn &amp; Restaurant, fishing lakes, cottages and a Caravan Club CL site. There is a picnic area at a nearby sandstone cliff wall; the wall has carved reliefs of unknown origin or age.

=== Tetford and Salmonby Scarecrow Festival ===

Tetford and Salmonby hold an annual weekend Scarecrow Festival. Villagers build scarecrows modelled on TV and film personalities, historic and contemporary figures and fictional icons, and display them outside their houses each year during May. A Scarecrow Trail is just over away. The event raises funds for Tetford church and local charities.

<text>Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius (9 August 1883 – 24 April 1970) was a German fluid dynamics physicist. He was one of the first students of Prandtl.

Blasius provided a mathematical basis for boundary-layer drag but also showed as early as 1911 that the resistance to flow through smooth pipes could be expressed in terms of the Reynolds number for both laminar and turbulent flow. After six years in science he changed to &quot;Ingenieurschule Hamburg&quot; (today: University of Applied Sciences Hamburg) and became a Professor. On 1 April 1962 Heinrich Blasius celebrated his 50th anniversary in teaching. He was active in his field until he died on 24 April 1970.

One of his most notable contributions involves a description of the steady two-dimensional boundary-layer that forms on a semi-infinite plate that is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow formula_1.

<text>The Union of Arras (Dutch: &quot;Unie van Atrecht&quot;, French: &quot;Union d&#x27;Arras&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Unión de Arrás&quot;) was an alliance between the County of Artois, the County of Hainaut and the city of Douai in the Habsburg Netherlands in early 1579 during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Dissatisfied with the religious policies of rebel leader Prince of Orange and the States General of the Netherlands, and especially the rise of the radical Calvinist Republic of Ghent since October 1577, they signed a declaration on 6 January 1579 about their intent to offer a vigorous defense of the Roman Catholic religion against what they saw as encroachments by Calvinists in other provinces. These signatories would begin negotiations for a separate peace with the Spanish Crown, which resulted in the Treaty of Arras of 17 May 1579.

==Background==

After the Pacification of Ghent, the entire Habsburg Netherlands was united in opposition to the government of king Philip II of Spain, the overlord of the Netherlands. They formed the Union of Brussels that constituted a formal government, formed by the States General and a governor-general who was appointed by the States General: the archduke Matthias, in competition with the royal governor-general, Don Juan of Austria. Orange, the leader of the originally rebelling provinces, Holland and Zeeland, had a leading role in the Council of State that formed the executive for the States General. One of the important provisions of the Pacification was that the Calvinists received freedom of religion in Holland and Zeeland, and would be tolerated elsewhere in the Netherlands, but that the other 15 provinces would officially maintain the Catholic Church as the dominant one. Calvinists in other provinces soon also claimed freedom of religion. In Flanders and Brabant they even used force to change the government of cities like Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp to obtain this objective, much to the dismay of Catholic politicians in the southern part of the country. Orange tried to promote civil peace with a policy of &quot;religious peace,&quot; allowing freedom of worship to both Catholics and Protestants in the entire Netherlands.

==Declaration of 6 January 1579==
Don Juan died in October 1578 and was replaced as commander of the Spanish Army of Flanders and royal governor-general by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who proved an able diplomat, adept at driving wedges between the Catholic nobles in the south and the regime of Orange and the States General. In opposition to the policies of Orange a group of Catholic nobles, known in historiography by the name &quot;Malcontents,&quot; had formed under the leadership of the stadtholder of Hainaut, Philip de Lalaing, 3rd Count of Lalaing and Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing. Parma opened negotiations with the Malcontents and they brought about an alliance of Hainaut, Artois, and the city of Douai, which on 6 January 1579 subscribed to a declaration in which they expressed their discontent about the events since the Pacification of Ghent, and (without naming names) rejected the &quot;religious peace&quot; policy of Orange. The declaration issued in the following rousing promise: 
Beyond this promise the declaration did not contain more concrete resolutions, such as the formation of a defensive alliance, like a number of the northern provinces formed later in January 1579 in the form of the Union of Utrecht. But this was not to be expected, as the signers of the declaration considered themselves the &quot;true&quot; defenders of the Union of Brussels, that they intended to continue.

==Peace of Arras==
However, the members of the Union of Arras soon opened peace negotiations with Parma, which resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Arras (1579) on 17 May 1579. 
These were the main conditions:
* The provisions of the Pacification of Ghent, the Perpetual Edict and the Union of Brussels were reaffirmed, both by the Spanish Crown and the members of the Union of Arras;
* There should be no more garrisons of foreign mercenary troops, either paid by Spain or by the States General;
* The Council of State should be organized like that of the time of Charles V;
* Two-thirds of the council members should be installed by all States of the member provinces consenting;
* All privileges that were in force at the time of the reign of Charles V should be reinstated;
* Taxes imposed after the reign of Charles V were to be abolished;
* Roman Catholicism was the only allowed religion. Any other religion (i.e. Calvinism) should be prohibited.

The provinces that signed the Peace were:

* County of Hainaut
* County of Artois
* Lille, Douai and Orchies (Walloon Flanders)

The regions that favored the Peace, but did not sign it at time (though they later acceded), were 
* County of Namur, 
* County of Luxembourg, 
* Duchy of Limburg.

Parma used these &quot;reconciled&quot; counties as a base to start his reconquest of the &quot;disobedient&quot; provinces (members of the Union of Utrecht).

<text>William Thomas Pipes (April 15, 1850 – October 7, 1909) was a politician in Nova Scotia, Canada.

== Biography ==

Pipes was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He ran in the 1878 federal election against Charles Tupper, but was unable to wrest away Tupper&#x27;s seat in the House of Commons of Canada. In 1882, Pipes ran as a Liberal candidate in the provincial election and won a seat.

The Liberals unexpectedly won the most seats in the legislature despite the fact that they had no leader. William S. Fielding was at the time editor of the Halifax &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; and could have become premier, but declined due to his lack of financial resources.

The caucus selected Pipes to lead the party and become the sixth Premier. The position was an unpaid one at the time, so Pipes had to continue his law practice. Pipes served as premier for two years, but was hobbled by personal problems and the need to earn a living. He induced Fielding to enter cabinet, and they became close collaborators.

The principal policy objective of the Pipes government was to secure a transfer of the Pictou railway line from the federal government to the province and to purchase and complete the privately owned &quot;Eastern Extension Railway&quot;. The federal and provincial governments were unable to agree on a price, and the Pipes government abandoned the project. The Pipes government also tried to get financial assistance from Ottawa, but was unsuccessful, and was forced to cut government spending.

Pipes&#x27; personal situation became increasingly untenable, and his relations with his cabinet (aside from Fielding) were frayed. On July 15, 1884, Pipes resigned as Premier, and nominated Fielding as his successor.

Pipes broke with Fielding in 1886, however, as Fielding moved for the province&#x27;s secession from Canadian confederation due to the federal government&#x27;s neglect of the province&#x27;s demands. During that year&#x27;s election, Pipes referred to Fielding&#x27;s campaign as &quot;the putrid carcass of repeal&quot;.

In 1887, Pipes again attempted to win a seat in the federal House of Commons, but again failed to dislodge Tupper. In 1906, he returned to provincial politics, and served as Attorney-General in the cabinet of Premier George Henry Murray until his death in Boston.

Pipes was involved in business as director of Amherst Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Co, a large shareholder in the Rhodes Curry Company, and director and secretary of the Nova Scotia Lumber Company. He held these positions during his time as a provincial cabinet minister.

<doc id="557618" wikidata="Q245099" url="?curid=557618" title="Zwischenzug">
<text>The zwischenzug (German: , &quot;intermediate move&quot;; also called an in-between move) is a chess tactic in which a player, instead of playing the expected move (commonly a ), first interposes another move posing an immediate threat that the opponent must answer, and only then plays the expected move. It is a move that has a high degree of &quot;initiative&quot;. Ideally, the zwischenzug changes the situation to the player&#x27;s advantage, such as by gaining or avoiding what would otherwise be a strong continuation for the opponent.

Such a move is also called an &quot;intermezzo&quot; () or &quot;in-between move&quot;. When the intermediate move is a check, it is sometimes called an &quot;in-between check&quot;, &quot;zwischenschach&quot;, or &quot;zwischen-check&quot;.

As with any fairly common chess tactic, it is impossible to pinpoint when the first zwischenzug was played. Three early examples are Lichtenhein–Morphy, New York 1857; Rosenthal–De Vere, Paris 1867; and Tartakower–José Raúl Capablanca, New York 1924. The first known use of the term zwischenzug, however, did not occur until 1933, when the prolific American chess authors Fred Reinfeld and Irving Chernev used it in their book &quot;Chess Strategy and Tactics&quot;.
==History==

No one knows when the first zwischenzug was played, but it was evident long before the term itself existed. One early example was Lichtenhein–Morphy, New York 1857. In the diagram, White has just captured Black&#x27;s knight on e4 and surely expected the recapture 10...dxe4 11.0-0, when White&#x27;s king is safe and he has the better pawn structure. Morphy, the strongest player of the day, instead played the zwischenzug 10...Qh4! with the threat 11...Qxf2#, so White cannot save the bishop (11.Bf3?? Qxf2#). Moreover, 11.0-0 would be met by 11...Qxe4 12.Nc3 Qg6 (not 12...Qh4? 13.Nxd5!), when &quot;Black has the two bishops and a compact position without serious weakness&quot;. Instead, White correctly played 11.Qe2 (forcing Black to weaken his pawns), but then erred with 11...dxe4 12.Be3? (after 12.0-0!, Black has only a slight advantage) Bg4! 13.Qc4? Bxe3!! and Morphy went on to win a .

Rosenthal–De Vere, Paris 1867, is another 19th-century example of a zwischenzug. De Vere (Black) had earlier sacrificed a piece for two pawns. White has just played 16.Bxb4. Instead of recapturing with 16...Qxb4+, De Vere first played the zwischenzug (specifically, a zwischenschach) 16...Rc1+! After 17.Kd2 Rxf1 18.Qxf1 Qxb4+ 19.Ke2 Qxf4 20.Qg1 Nxe5, De Vere&#x27;s zwischenzug had netted him two more pawns, leaving him with the of four pawns for a knight. White resigned after twelve more moves.

Another prominent example that brought the concept of zwischenzug, albeit not the term itself, to public attention was Tartakower–Capablanca, New York 1924. This was a game won by the reigning World Champion at one of the strongest tournaments of the early 20th century. In the position in the diagram, Tartakower (White) has just played 9.Bxb8, thinking he has caught Capablanca in a trap: if 9...Rxb8, 10.Qa4+ and 11.Qxb4 wins a bishop. However, Capablanca sprang the zwischenzug 9...Nd5!, protecting his bishop and also threatening 10...Ne3+, forking White&#x27;s king and queen. After Tartakower&#x27;s 10.Kf2 Rxb8, Capablanca had regained his piece and went on to win in 20 more moves. Note that after 10.Bf4 (instead of 10.Kf2), Black would not play 10...Nxf4??, which would still allow 11.Qa4+, winning a piece. Instead, after 10.Bf4 Black would play a second zwischenzug, 10...Qf6!, attacking the bishop again, and also renewing the threat of 11...Ne3+. After a move like 11.Qc1, Black could either take the bishop or consider yet a third zwischenzug with 11...Bd6.

Alekhine, Reinfeld, and Tartakower and du Mont do not call 9...Nd5! a &quot;zwischenzug&quot; in their books (originally published in 1925, 1942, and 1952, respectively). Instead, they refer to it as, respectively, &quot;a bit of finesse&quot;, a &quot;sly interpolation&quot;, and an &quot;intermediary manoeuvre&quot;.
 
The earliest known use of the term zwischenzug did not occur until after all of these games. According to chess historian Edward Winter, the first known use was in 1933. Fred Reinfeld and Irving Chernev, annotating the game Max Euwe–Gyula Breyer, Vienna 1921, called Breyer&#x27;s 27th move, 27...Nge3!, &quot;an important &quot;Zwischenzug&quot;&quot;. The game can be played over here.
==Additional examples==

The diagram shows another example. Black, on move, plays
:1... Rxh4?
expecting White to play 2.Qxh4, when Black retains a material advantage. However, White has a zwischenzug: 
:2. Qd8+!
which is followed by 
:2... Kh7 
:3. Qxh4+ Kg8
:4. Qxg3
and White has won a rook, leaving him with a winning position.
===Mieses vs. Reshevsky===

A zwischenzug occurred in Mieses–Reshevsky, Margate 1935. From the position in the diagram, play continued:
:29. Nd4 Bxd4
:30. cxd4
White must have expected 30...Qxd4 31.Qxc4 Re1+ and then 32.Kg2 gets him out of trouble, but Black has a zwischenzug:
:30... Re4!
Making a on the d-pawn and preventing the capture of his own pawn. Now if 31.Qxc4, 31...Re1+ forces 32.Rxe1 and White loses his queen.
===L. Steiner vs. Helling===

L. Steiner–Helling, Berlin 1928, provides another example of the zwischenschach (in-between check). Black has just captured White&#x27;s pawn on f2 with his knight (see diagram). White responded with 
:16. Qxf2
expecting the skewer 16...Bg3??, which he would refute with 17.Qxf7+! Rxf7 18.Re8#. Instead, Black first played the zwischenschach 
:16... Bh2+! 
Now 17.Kxh2 Qxf2 loses White&#x27;s queen. The game continued 
:17.Kf1 Bg3! 
Not seeing the point, White blithely continued with his plan: 
:18. Qxf7+?? Rxf7+ 
Now White realized that he is in check (that was the point of 16...Bh2+!), so his intended 19.Re8# is illegal. The forced 19.Bxf7+ Kxf7 would leave Black with queen for rook, an easily winning material advantage, so White resigned.
===Kerchev vs. Karastoichev===

In the game Zlatozar Kerchev–Emil Stefanov Karastoichev, 1965 (), Black moved 
:1... Ng5
discovering an attack on White&#x27;s queen. 
:2. Qxg6
If White moves the queen to another square, Black&#x27;s knight captures White&#x27;s rook on f3, winning the exchange. Instead of immediately recapturing the queen, Black played
:2... Nxf3+
and White must get out of check. After
:3. Bxf3 hxg6
Black had won the exchange.
===Carlsen vs. Anand===

In game 5 of the 2013 World Chess Championship match, Carlsen had captured a bishop with 20.cxb6, and Anand maintained material balance by capturing a knight with 20...fxe4, also attacking White&#x27;s bishop (see diagram). Instead of immediately taking the pawn with 21.Bxe4, which would have given Anand the opportunity to fix his queenside pawn weaknesses with 21...axb6, Carlsen played the zwischenzug 
:21. b7
After the necessary 
:21... Rab8
:22. Bxe4 Rxb7
Anand&#x27;s a- and c-pawns remained isolated. Black&#x27;s weaker pawn structure was an important factor to Carlsen&#x27;s initiative in this first decisive game of the match.

<doc id="557619" wikidata="Q2741512" url="?curid=557619" title="Synovial joint">
<text>A synovial joint, also known as diarthrosis, joins bones or cartilage with a fibrous joint capsule that is continuous with the periosteum of the joined bones, constitutes the outer boundary of a synovial cavity, and surrounds the bones&#x27; articulating surfaces. This joint unites long bones and permits free bone movement and greater mobility. The synovial cavity/joint is filled with synovial fluid. The joint capsule is made up of an outer layer of fibrous membrane, which keeps the bones together structurally, and an inner layer, the synovial membrane, which seals in the synovial fluid.

They are the most common and most movable type of joint in the body of a mammal. As with most other joints, synovial joints achieve movement at the point of contact of the articulating bones.

== Structure ==
Synovial joints contain the following structures:
* Synovial cavity: all diarthroses have the characteristic space between the bones that is filled with synovial fluid.
* Joint capsule: the fibrous capsule, continuous with the periosteum of articulating bones, surrounds the diarthrosis and unites the articulating bones; the joint capsule consists of two layers - (1) the outer fibrous membrane that may contain ligaments and (2) the inner synovial membrane that secretes the lubricating, shock absorbing, and joint-nourishing synovial fluid; the joint capsule is highly innervated, but without blood and lymph vessels, and receives nutrition from the surrounding blood supply via either diffusion (slow), or via convection (fast, more efficient), induced through exercise.
* Articular cartilage: the bones of a synovial joint are covered by a layer of hyaline cartilage that lines the epiphyses of the joint end of the bone with a smooth, slippery surface that prevents adhesion; articular cartilage functions to absorb shock and reduce friction during movement.

Many, but not all, synovial joints also contain additional structures:
* Articular discs or menisci - the fibrocartilage pads between opposing surfaces in a joint
* Articular fat pads - adipose tissue pads that protect the articular cartilage, as seen in the infrapatellar fat pad in the knee
* Tendons - cords of dense regular connective tissue composed of parallel bundles of collagen fibers
* Accessory ligaments (extracapsular and intracapsular) - the fibers of some fibrous membranes are arranged in parallel bundles of dense regular connective tissue that are highly adapted for resisting strains to prevent extreme movements that may damage the articulation
* Bursae - sac-like structures that are situated strategically to alleviate friction in some joints (shoulder and knee) that are filled with fluid similar to synovial fluid

The bone surrounding the joint on the proximal side is sometimes called the &quot;plafond&quot; (French word for ceiling), especially in the talocrural joint. Damage to this structure is referred to as a Gosselin fracture.

===Blood supply===
The blood supply of a synovial joint is derived from the arteries sharing in the anastomosis around the joint.

=== Types ===
There are seven types of synovial joints. Some are relatively immobile, therefore more stable. Others have multiple degrees of freedom, but at the expense of greater risk of injury. In ascending order of mobility, they are:

====Multiaxial joints====

A multiaxial joint (polyaxial joint or triaxial joint) is a synovial joint that allows for several directions of movement. In the human body, the shoulder and hip joints are multiaxial joints. They allow the upper or lower limb to move in an anterior-posterior direction and a medial-lateral direction. In addition, the limb can also be rotated around its long axis. This third movement results in rotation of the limb so that its anterior surface is moved either toward or away from the midline of the body.

==Function==

The movements possible with synovial joints are:
* abduction: movement away from the mid-line of the body
* adduction: movement toward the mid-line of the body
* extension: straightening limbs at a joint
* flexion: bending the limbs at a joint
* rotation: a circular movement around a fixed point

==Clinical significance==
The &quot;joint space&quot; equals the distance between the involved bones of the joint. A &quot;joint space narrowing&quot; is a sign of either (or both) osteoarthritis and inflammatory degeneration. The normal joint space is at least 2 mm in the hip (at the superior acetabulum), at least 3 mm in the knee, and 4–5 mm in the shoulder joint. For the temporomandibular joint, a joint space of between 1.5 and 4 mm is regarded as normal. Joint space narrowing is therefore a component of several radiographic classifications of osteoarthritis.

In rheumatoid arthritis, the clinical manifestations are primarily synovial inflammation and joint damage. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes, highly specialized mesenchymal cells found in the synovial membrane, have an active and prominent role in the pathogenic processes in the rheumatic joints. Therapies that target these cells are emerging as promising therapeutic tools, raising hope for future applications in rheumatoid arthritis.

<text>Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester (26 November 1549) was an English nobleman. He was the son of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester and Elizabeth Herbert, 3rd Baroness Herbert. On his father&#x27;s death on 15 April 1526, he succeeded as the second Earl of Worcester. From his mother, he inherited the title of Baron Herbert.

He was invested as a Knight on 1 November 1523 in Roye, France, by the Duke of Suffolk.
Somerset obtained Tintern Abbey after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

== Family ==
He married twice:
* Firstly, by papal dispensation dated 15 June 1514, to Lady Margaret Courtenay, daughter of William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon, by Catherine of York, daughter of Edward IV, King of England. Margaret died before 15 April 1526. Some sources say the union produced no children. 
* Secondly, before 1527, to Elizabeth Browne, daughter of Anthony Browne, Knt., by Lucy, daughter of John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. Somerset died on 26 November 1549. The children of Henry Somerset and Elizabeth Browne were:
** Lady Lucy Somerset (152423 February 1583) who married John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer.
** William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester (c. 1526/721 February 1589). Heir and successor of his father.
** Francis Somerset (By 153222 July 1563), often erroneously said to have died at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, but fought at the siege of Leith in 1560, and was Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire, 1558. He was killed in an attack on Le Havre in 1563
** Charles Somerset
** Thomas Somerset.
** Lady Anne Somerset (died 17 October 1596), married Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. Her husband was beheaded on 22 August 1572. They had four daughters and one son (died young).

<text>Network Solutions, LLC, formerly Web.com, is an American-based technology company and a subsidiary of Web.com, the 4th-largest .com domain name registrar, with over 6.7 million registrations as of August 2018. In addition to being a domain name registrar, Network Solutions provides web services such as web hosting, website design and online marketing, including search engine optimization and pay per click management.

==History==
Network Solutions started as a technology consulting company incorporated by Emmit McHenry with Ty Grigsby, Gary Desler and Ed Peters in Washington, D.C., in 1979.

In its first few years, the company focused on systems programming services, primarily in the IBM environment. Annual revenues passed $1 million in 1982, growing to $18.5 million in 1986.

Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) first operated the domain name system (DNS) registry under a sub-contract with the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in September 1991. NSI gave out names in the .com, .org, .mil, .gov, .edu and .net Top Level Domains (TLDs) for free, along with free Internet Protocol (IP) address blocks. 
The Network Information Center at SRI International had performed the work under Elizabeth J. Feinler since 1972.

In 1992, NSI was the sole bidder on a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to further develop the domain name registration service for the Internet. In 1993, NSI was granted an exclusive contract by the NSF to be the sole domain name registrar for .com (commerce), .net (network) and .org (organization) TLDs, a continuation of work NSI had already been doing. NSI also maintained the central database of assigned names called WHOIS. A contract was given to Boeing to operate the .mil TLD registry, and was also performed by NSI under subcontract.

In May 1993, the NSF privatized the domain name registry; Network Solutions was the only bidder on the $5.9 million annual contract to administer it.

In March 1995, the company was acquired by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for $4.7 million. At that time, the company managed 60,000 domain names.

Following the acquisition by SAIC, the NSF gave Network Solutions authority to charge for domain name registrations. Network Solutions imposed a charge of $100 for two years&#x27; registration. 30% of this revenue went to the NSF to create an &quot;Internet Intellectual Infrastructure Fund&quot;. In 1997, a lawsuit was filed charging Network Solutions with antitrust violations with regard to domain names. The 30% of the registration fee that went to the NSF was ruled by a court to be an illegal tax. This led to a reduction in the domain name registration fee to $70 (for two years).

Network Solutions also implemented a policy of censoring domain names. This came to light when Jeff Gold attempted to register the domain name shitakemushrooms.com but was unable to. Network Solutions&#x27; automated screening system blocked the registration &quot;because it contains four letters they consider obscene&quot;, though the domain name &#x27;shit.com&#x27; had been successfully registered. Network Solutions argued that it was within its First Amendment rights to block words it found offensive, even though it was operating pursuant to contract with a Federal agency.

Network Solutions&#x27; $100 charge and its monopoly position in the market were contributing pressures that resulted in the creation of the International Ad Hoc Committee and a failed attempt to take control of the domain name system, and to the U.S. Department of Commerce and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) releasing a white paper and ultimately contracting with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to administer the DNS.

In September 1997, the Network Solutions () became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO).

After the formation of ICANN in 1998, the domain name industry opened up to partial competition, with NSI retaining its monopoly on .com, .net and .org but having to recognize a separation between the functions of a registry, which manages the underlying database of domain names, and that of a registrar, which acts as a retail provider of domain names. To achieve this separation, NSI created a &quot;firewall&quot; between the two new divisions of the business, creating separate technical infrastructure, organizations, and facilities. By the end of 1999 the fee for registration had been reduced, from $34.99, to a wholesale rate of $6 per year to registered resellers.

In May 1999, Jim Rutt was named chief executive officer of the company; he stepped down in February 2001.

In 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, the company was acquired by VeriSign for $21 billion in stock ().

On October 17, 2003, VeriSign announced the sale of Network Solutions to Pivotal Equity Group for $100 million.

In January 2006, Network Solutions acquired MonsterCommerce, an e-commerce company in the Greater St. Louis area.

In February 2007, General Atlantic, a private equity firm, acquired the company for a reported $800 million.

In January 2008, Roy Dunbar was appointed CEO.

On November 2, 2009, Tim Kelly, president of the company, replaced Dunbar as CEO. Dunbar continued to act as chairman and advisor to the company.

In August 2011, Web.com announced the acquisition of the company for $405 million and 18 million shares of newly issued Web.com stock (), which closed at $8.66 per share before the announcement, for a total purchase price of about $560 million. The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2011.

This was immediately followed by the departure of CEO Kelly and other leadership. Large-scale employee layoffs began the following day as well. By December 31, 2011, over half of the office space in the Herndon, Virginia, headquarters had been vacated, and on March 31, 2012, the company&#x27;s Belleville, Illinois, office was closed.

In June 2020, Network Solutions revoked the domain name registration of two hate sites (VDARE and niggermania.com) after receiving a demand letter from the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a civil rights organization.

==2008 domain name front running class action lawsuit==

Network Solutions offers a search engine that permits users to find out if a domain name is available for purchase. Unregistered domain names entered into this search engine are then speculatively reserved by Network Solutions. This &quot;reservation&quot; can be removed by anyone immediately by contacting Network Solutions customer service hotline, or it will automatically unreserve within four days, allowing the domain to be freely registered anywhere. Also, visitors searching for domain names on their website allow the reservation when they click &quot;OK&quot; on the Reservation Confirmation dialog box. Clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; will prevent the domain name from being reserved.

On January 8, 2008, &quot;Domain Name Wire&quot; published a story alleging that Network Solutions practices domain name front running. &quot;If you try to register a domain at Network Solutions, but decide not to register it, you won&#x27;t be able to register it anywhere else&quot;, the article says. &quot;Network Solutions registers the domain in its company name with the words &#x27;This Domain is available at NetworkSolutions.com&#x27;.&quot; Circle ID reported on January 8, 2008, that Jonathon Nevett, Vice President of Policy at Network Solutions and one of the seven members of the ICANN community who was consulted by the ICANN committee looking at registrar abuse of domain &quot;tasting&quot;, as the availability search practice is called, had offered a response to the news story stating Network Solutions&#x27; policy. The policy was &quot;a security measure to protect our customers&quot;, said Nevett. &quot;When a customer searches for an available domain name at our website, but decides not to purchase the name immediately after conducting the search&quot;, Nevett added, &quot;after the search ends, we will put the domain name on reserve.&quot; Nevett said that if the domain was &quot;not purchased within 4 days, it will be released back to the registry and will be generally available for registration.&quot; But once a name was supposedly &quot;reserved&quot; for a potential customer, not only was it not available at any less expensive registrar, but the fee charged by Network Solutions went up to $35 instead of the original fee charged of around $10.

Jay Westerdal, one of the seven members of the ICANN community who was consulted by the ICANN committee looking at domain tasting abuse, published an article on &quot;Domain Tools&quot; on January 8, 2008, stating that Network Solutions is exposing the domains to domain tasters. The domain tasters &quot;will snipe those domain up milliseconds after Network Solutions deletes them&quot;, says Westerdal. &quot;It is a deplorable action that Network Solutions would announce potential domain names to the entire world&quot;, Westerdal added. On January 8, 2008, Tucows, the largest publicly traded domain name registrar, published an article on its company web site titled &quot;Registrar Reputation and Trust&quot; criticizing Network Solutions policy. &quot;Potential Registrants are effectively forced to purchase the domain from Network Solutions for a period of four days at which point the domain is dropped&quot;, wrote Tucows employee James Koole. Koole says that Tucows has found a way to address the issue of domain tasting and has policies in place that uphold the rights of Registrants. &quot;Tucows works to prevent domain name tasting by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)&quot;, Koole said. &quot;Tucows doesn&#x27;t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names&quot;, Koole added.

On January 9, 2008, &quot;CNET&quot; reported that Network Solutions will soon not register domains when people search for domains from the company&#x27;s Whois search page, will offer only an &quot;under construction&quot; page for sites that it has reserved, and newly reserved pages won&#x27;t be linked to the numerical Internet addresses that allow Web browsers to locate the pages. Network Solutions will continue to register domains when people search for domains from the company&#x27;s home page.

===Class action and resolution===
On February 25, 2008, law firms Kabateck LLP, (then Kabateck Brown Kellner), and Engstrom, Lipscomb &amp; Lack, filed class-action lawsuits, &quot;McElroy v. Network Solutions LLC, et. al&quot; and &quot;James Lee Finseth v. Network Solutions LLC&quot;, against the company for front running, which was settled in favor of the plaintiffs, in 2009.

==Controversies==
===Server breach===
In August 2009, Network Solutions notified customers that its servers were breached, and led to the exposure of names, address, and credit card numbers of more than 573,000 people who made purchases on Web sites hosted by the company. Susan Wade, a spokesperson for Network Solutions, said, &quot;We really feel terrible about this&quot;. At the time of this writing, NSI does not know how their servers were compromised.

===Malware===
One year later in August 2010, Network Solutions discovered that one of their widgets offered to their domain registration and hosting customers was capable of distributing malware by sites displaying it. As many as 5,000,000 of their registered domains may have been affected by the hack. The affected widget was at least temporarily addressed by Network Solutions, who were able to make changes to the code to prevent it from loading.

===WebLock Service===
In January, 2014 Network Solutions&#x27; marketing department sent an email to customers stating that the company would be automatically enrolling customers in a new security program called WebLock, for an initial charge of $1,850 for the first year and $1,350 each subsequent year. The company claimed the cost offset new security features to protect domains, including registering as a &quot;certified user&quot; and confirmation of configuration changes with those &quot;certified users&quot;.

... To help recapture the costs of maintaining this extra level of security for your account, your credit card will be billed $1,850 for the first year of service on the date your program goes live... After that you will be billed $1,350 on every subsequent year from that date. If you wish to opt out of this program you may do so by calling us at 1-888-642-0265.

Web.com COO Jason Teichman later clarified that the program would actually be opt-in, saying &quot;we did not do a good job in wording that [email]&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s not our intention to enroll anyone in a program they don&#x27;t want.&quot;

===Publishing Non-Public Information===
In September, 2009, Network Solutions began publishing a list of domain name WHOIS searches performed by customers and other service users in the past day.

===&quot;Fitna&quot; controversy===
In March 2008, &quot;Fitnathemovie.com&quot;, a website that Dutch politician Geert Wilders had reserved at Network Solutions, was taken offline. Wilders intended to host a film he had created, &quot;Fitna&quot;. At that time, the only page on the site was a picture of the Qur&#x27;an accompanied by the text &quot;Geert Wilders presents Fitna&quot; and &quot;Coming soon&quot;. Network Solutions&#x27; notice stated that they were &quot;investigating whether the site&#x27;s content is in violation of the Network Solutions Acceptable Use Policy&quot;. Wilders said the 15-minute film will show how verses from the Qur&#x27;an are being used today to incite modern Muslims to behave violently and anti-democratically.

As a result of Network Solutions&#x27; decision, &quot;fitnathemovie.com&quot; was not available to the public on the day of the film&#x27;s release. Wilders expressed his displeasure with Network Solutions for pre-censoring the domain name.

Network Solutions also came under criticism because although they refused to host Wilders&#x27; website, they had provided registration services for the Hezbollah domain hizbollah.org. In response to these criticisms, Network Solutions agreed that hizbollah.org violated their acceptable use policy and ceased hosting that web site, as well.

Due to heavy media coverage, many people were aware of the film&#x27;s existence and the controversy surrounding its domain name. Some were outraged by the actions of Network Solutions in dealing with one of its customers. Freedom of speech protestors created videos commenting on the situation, and some uploaded Wilders&#x27; film to social networking sites such as YouTube shortly after its release. Protestors for both sides created their own blogs and video statements on the matter. Anti-censorship protestors took their campaigns to sites such as YouTube in order to alert others of the situation. On March 23, 2008, Brian Krebs of the Washington Post published an article explaining more facts related to the event. Krebs wrote that Network Solutions spokesperson Susan Wade stated that Network Solutions had received several complaints regarding the website, but she did not elaborate on the specific nature of the complaints.

===Controversy over subdomain hijacking===
In April 2008, reports indicated that in addition to the aforementioned front-running practices, Network Solutions had begun exploiting an obscure provision of its end-user license agreement that permits it to use and advertise on its users&#x27; unassigned subdomains, even despite the registration and private ownership of the top-level domain itself. The provision states: 
&#x27;You also agree that any domain name directory, sub-directory, file name or path (e.g.) that does not resolve to an active web page on your Web site being hosted by Network Solutions, may be used by Network Solutions to place a &quot;parking&quot; page, &quot;under construction&quot; page, or other temporary page that may include promotions and advertisements for, and links to, Network Solutions&#x27; Web site...&#x27;&quot;

Ars Technica has documented how to opt out of this scheme, but many private domain holders and privacy advocates cite the move as another step in Network Solutions&#x27; series of recent attempts to push the boundaries of profitability and responsibility in its domain practices.

===&quot;Races.com&quot; controversy===
According to a Wired.com article, in 1999 Network Solutions bungled the transfer of &quot;races.com&quot;, accidentally placing it back into the pool of available domain names. MBA student John McLanahan purchased the domain privately for thousands of dollars. A domain name speculator was able to obtain it, and demanded $500,000 for its return.

===Misleading customers over refunds===
In April 2015, the Federal Trade Commission announced that Network Solutions had agreed to settle charges that it misled consumers who bought web hosting services by promising a full refund if they canceled within 30 days. In reality, the FTC stated, the company withheld substantial cancellation fees amounting to up to 30 percent of the refund.

<doc id="557638" wikidata="Q6134455" url="?curid=557638" title="USS Manchester (CL-83)">
<text>USS &quot;Manchester&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship was laid down 25 September 1944 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 5 March 1946; sponsored by Mrs. Ernest J. Gladu; and commissioned 29 October 1946, Capt. Peter G. Hale in command.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Manchester&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Manchester&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==

===Mediterranean, 1947–1949===

&quot;Manchester&quot; completed her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean and returned to Boston, her home port, 26 March 1947. There she was equipped with an experimental plastic cover for her bridge to be tested on her first transatlantic crossing. On 18 April, she steamed for the Mediterranean to lend visible support to the Truman Doctrine of 12 March. Returning to the East Coast for two weeks in June, she conducted a Naval Reserve training cruise out of Newport, R.I. She resumed her Mediterranean cruise 25 June, returning to Boston 30 November. &quot;Manchester&quot; completed two more deployments with the 6th Fleet (9 February to 26 June 1948, 3 January to 4 March 1949) before departing Philadelphia 18 March for assignment with the Pacific Fleet.

===Far East, 1949===
She arrived at Long Beach 3 April and departed two weeks later for the politically volatile Far East, entering the harbor at Tsingtao, China, 15 May. The cruiser operated in the Yellow, East China, and South China Seas until returning to Long Beach 28 November.

During this time, the Nationalist Chinese forces, having suffered extreme setbacks, had begun their withdrawal to the island of Taiwan, 16 July, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China had been proclaimed at Peiping, 1 October 1949. The success of the Red Chinese bolstered other Asian Communist aspirations. On 25 June 1950, North Korean leaders ordered their troops to cross the 38th parallel into South Korea. The United Nations quickly declared North Korea the aggressor and called on members of that body to repel the invasion, 26 to 27 June.

===Korean War, 1950–1953===

====1950====
At that time, &quot;Manchester&quot;, docked at San Francisco, was undergoing overhaul. Work was sped up and by 1 August the cruiser was on her way to the Western Pacific. She arrived at Sasebo, Japan, in early September and joined TF 77. As part of a carrier group, she commenced operations in the Yellow Sea, supporting United Nations Forces air efforts against the elongated Communist communications lines by coastal patrol, blockade, and bombardment. On 15 September, &quot;Manchester&quot; provided fire support for the landings at Inchon. After the establishment of major control of the Inchon–Seoul transport complex, she moved north to bombard North Korean troop concentrations on Tungsan Got, while aircraft from her strike force hit the railhead at Ongjin, 27 September. This action effectively slowed reinforcement of Communist forces in the south by disrupting their supply lines and keeping their troops occupied in defensive action.

&quot;Manchester&quot; then steamed with her task group around the peninsula to support the invasion at Wonsan. Arriving 10 October, she commenced shore bombardment and patrol duties in support of the minesweeping operations in the area while planes from TF 77 conducted raids against North Korean vessels, road and rail centers, warehouses, and supply depots as far north as Songjin. The U.N. Forces soon reached the Yalu River and, as the heavy fighting appeared to be over, &quot;Manchester&quot; was reassigned, 29 October, to TF 72, then patrolling the Taiwan Straits. This patrol duty was ended shortly thereafter by the full scale intervention of Communist Chinese troops in Korea. On 3 December, the cruiser rejoined TF 77 and steamed to Hungnam to support the complete evacuation of that port and the demolition of its facilities. Completing this operation, the task force continued to defend U.N. units, effecting their safe withdrawal from untenable positions.

====1951====

On 8 January 1951, &quot;Manchester&quot; evacuated injured crewmembers from the Thai corvette HTMS &quot;Prasae&quot;, which had grounded the previous day behind enemy lines near Kisamon Tan on the east coast. Naval gunfire kept enemy soldiers from swarming onto the ship until, the ship having been declared unsalvageable, the remainder of the crew was taken off by the cruiser&#x27;s helicopter. Guns from accompanying destroyers were then turned on &quot;Prasae&quot;.

For the next month and a half, &quot;Manchester&quot; patrolled off the east coast of Korea. Firing at both shore and inland targets, she blasted communication and transportation centers, destroying and disrupting the enemy&#x27;s equipment and troop concentrations. On 22 February, she steamed to Wonsan to add her guns to the siege and blockade of that port which had commenced five days earlier. She continued to conduct shore bombardment activities along the northeast coast, primarily at Wonsan and Songjin, for the remainder of her first Korean combat tour.

On 1 June, &quot;Manchester&quot; departed Korean waters for Yokosuka en route back to Long Beach, arriving in California 15 June. Spending less than five months at home, the cruiser was underway for the Far East again 5 November. She arrived back in the combat zone 8 December and took up duties as flagship of TF 95, the U.N. blockading and escort force.

====1952====
By this time, the conflict had altered in character, from quick forceful action to perseverance in the systematic destruction of the enemy&#x27;s personnel and equipment. To this purpose, TF 95 maintained a blockade along the entire Korean coast and bombarded the Communist&#x27;s main supply routes, which, because of the mountainous terrain, lay on the narrow coastal plains. &quot;Manchester&quot; patrolled along the Korean Peninsula shelling military targets in areas such as Chinnamp&#x27;o, Chongjin, Tong&#x27;Cho-Ri as well as regularly returning to Hungnam, Songjin, and Wonsan to add to the destruction of those tightly held enemy positions. While her guns blasted, &quot;Manchester&#x27;s&quot; helicopters continued her reputation as a good friend of downed pilots, performing rescues at sea and on land behind enemy lines. Her medical officers also worked overtime aiding sick and wounded members of the U.N. Forces.

On 14 May 1952, &quot;Manchester&quot; completed her second tour in Korea and departed the bombline on the east coast of Korea. She returned to Long Beach 29 May, departing two weeks later for voyage repairs and overhaul at San Francisco.

====1953====

The new year, 1953, brought no change in the negative results of the cease-fire talks begun at Kaesong 10 July 1951 and later moved to Panmunjom. The conflict continued and &quot;Manchester&quot; departed on 25 January for her third deployment in Korean waters. On 4 March, she rejoined TF 77 on the bombline off the peninsula&#x27;s east coast. On 8 March, she returned to Wonsan and again commenced shelling Wonsan. She came back to this besieged city periodically during this tour, spending the remainder of the time on patrol along the bombline, providing fire support for the U.N. Forces at the eastern end of the frontline.

On 23 July, &quot;Manchester&quot; departed Korea for Yokosuka. On 27 July, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom and hostilities ended. On 28 July, &quot;Manchester&quot; got underway for her homeport, having successfully completed three combat tours with no major battle damage.

===Pacific, 1954–1956===
During 1954 and 1955, the cruiser was twice deployed for six month periods with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. On her last return voyage she participated in Operation &quot;Glory&quot;, the return to Hawaii of fifty unidentified American dead from the Korean War. Departing Yokosuka 20 January 1956, she stopped at Pearl Harbor for ceremonies and continued on to Long Beach, arriving 5 February. At the end of the month, she sailed for San Francisco, where she entered the Reserve Fleet 27 February, and decommissioned 27 June 1956. Struck from the Navy list 1 April 1960, she was sold 31 October 1960 to the Nicolai Joffe Corp.
