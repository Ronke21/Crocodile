<text>Hunter College High School is a public academic magnet secondary school located in the Carnegie Hill section of the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It is administered and funded by Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY) and no tuition is charged. According to Hunter, its 1,200 &quot;students represent the top one-quarter of 1% of students in New York City, based on test scores.&quot;

==History==
===19th century===
Hunter was established in 1869 as &quot;The Female Normal and High School&quot;, a private school to prepare young women to become teachers. The original school was composed of an elementary and a high school. A kindergarten was added in 1887, and in 1888, the school was incorporated into a college. 

===20th and 21st centuries===
The high school was separated from what would become Hunter College in 1903. In 1914, both schools were named after the Female Normal School&#x27;s first president, Thomas Hunter. The school was almost closed by Hunter College President Jacqueline Wexler in the early 1970s.

Hunter was an all-girls school for its first 105 years, with the official name &quot;Hunter College High School for Intellectually Gifted Young Ladies&quot;. The prototypical Hunter girl was the subject of the song &quot;Sarah Maria Jones&quot;, who, the lyrics told, had &quot;Hunter in her bones.&quot; In 1878, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published an approving article about the then-new school:
The first thing to excite our wonder and admiration was the number – there were 1,542 pupils; the second thing was the earnestness of the discipline; and the third was the suggestiveness of so many girls at work in assembly, with their own education as the primary aim, and the education of countless thousands of others as the final aim, of their toil.
Girls all the way from fourteen to twenty years of age, from the farther edge of childhood to the farther limit of maidenhood; girls with every shade of complexion and degree of beauty; girls in such variety that it was amazing to contemplate the reduction of their individuality to the simple uniformity of their well-drilled movements.
The catholicity and toleration crystallized in the country&#x27;s Constitution prevail in the college: about two hundred of the students are Jewesses, and a black face, framed in curly African hair, may occasionally be seen.
The aim of the entire course through which the Normal students pass is not so much to burden the mind with facts as it is to develop intellectual power, cultivate judgment, and enable the graduates to take trained ability into the world with them.

The school began admitting boys in 1974 as a result of a lawsuit by Hunter College Elementary School parents, a development which was described in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; with the headline &quot;Girlie High Gets 1st Freshboys.&quot; In January 1982, the school was featured in a &quot;New York Magazine&quot; article entitled &quot;The Joyful Elite.&quot; Hunter was the subject of the 1992 book &quot;Hunter College Campus Schools for the Gifted: The Challenge of Equity and Excellence&quot; published by Teachers&#x27; College Press.

The high school has occupied a number of buildings throughout its history, including one at the East 68th Street campus of the college (1940–1970). For several years in the 1970s, it was housed on the 13th and 14th floors of an office building at 466 Lexington Avenue (at East 46th Street), the current location of what is now known as the Park Avenue Atrium. 

Since 1977, it has existed at the former site of the Madison Avenue Armory at East 94th Street between Park and Madison Avenues on the Upper East Side. Although most of the armory building was demolished, the armory&#x27;s façade, including two empty towers, was left partly standing on Madison Avenue. The school building itself, which faces Park Avenue, was constructed to resemble the armory. Because of its unusual design, including many classrooms without windows and the rest with only narrow windows, Hunter is called &quot;The Brick Prison.&quot;
 The building contains both the high school (grades 7–12) and the elementary school (K-6), which are collectively known as the Hunter College Campus Schools.

==Admissions==
Admission to Hunter College High School is selective, only being open to seventh-grade students, with the admission process consisting of two steps. Students from the five boroughs of New York City with high scores on their fifth-grade standardized tests are eligible to take the entrance exam during their sixth-grade school year. To qualify, public school students must score in the 90th percentile or above on both the New York State reading and math tests, while private and parochial school students must score in the 90th percentile or above (in both reading and math) compared to all private school students nationwide. This results in approximately 2,500– or less than 4%— of New York City&#x27;s 65,000 fifth graders being eligible to take the test. From those, around 182 to 185 students are offered admission, representing &quot;the top one-quarter of 1% of students in New York City, based on test scores.&quot;

The only other pathway to the High School is through the elementary school, to which 50 students are admitted to kindergarten after taking an IQ test and being interviewed. The kindergarten admission process is the sole entrance route to the elementary school. Approximately 45 students from Hunter College Elementary School enter the seventh-grade class each year. Starting from the 2010–2011 school year, elementary school students must demonstrate &quot;satisfactory progress&quot; by fifth grade in order to gain admission to the high school, whereas previously, they were guaranteed admission.

In total, an entering 7th grade class contains approximately 225 students, known as &quot;Hunterites,&quot; about 200 of whom will graduate from the school. Those who leave go to other magnet schools, private schools, local public schools or leave the city. The total enrollment from grades 7 through 12 is approximately 1,200 students.

===Concerns about admission policies===

Author and alumnus Chris Hayes stated in &quot;Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy&quot; that the school&#x27;s sole reliance on the one test for admissions reproduces societal inequalities – that students whose families cannot afford intensive test prep courses are less likely to earn competitive scores on the entrance exam. In recent years, underrepresentation of African-Americans among students admitted to the school, compared to their numbers in the public school system, has increased. Hayes quotes Hunter College High School&#x27;s 2010 graduate Justin Hudson&#x27;s commencement speech:
If you truly believe that the demographics of Hunter represent the distribution of intelligence in this city, then you must believe that the Upper West Side, Bayside and Flushing are intrinsically more intelligent than the South Bronx, Bedford–Stuyvesant and Washington Heights, and I refuse to accept that.

Because of its relatively small size, and because the school is run by Hunter College rather than by the city&#x27;s education department, Hunter has largely avoided being caught up in the debate over diversity at the specialized high schools in New York City. However, some alumni and students have expressed concern about the lack of diversity at the school, where only 6.3 percent of the student body is Hispanic and 2.2 percent African-American (67% of NYC public school children are black or Hispanic). On the other hand, while Asians make up 16.2% of NYC public-school children, they make up 49.4% of the student body at the school, based on NYC department of education data.

==Academics==
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ranked Hunter as the top public school in the United States and noted that it is a feeder to Ivy League and other elite colleges. &quot;Worth&quot; likewise ranked Hunter as the top public school in the country. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Hunter &quot;the prestigious Upper East Side school known for its Ivy League-bound students&quot; and &quot;the fast track to law, medicine and academia.&quot; Publicly available data indicate that Hunter has both the highest average SAT score and the highest average ACT score of any school in the United States, public or private, though complete data is needed to be conclusive.

All Hunter students pursue a six-year program of study. Hunter is a college preparatory high school that provides a liberal arts education. The majority of subjects are accelerated such that high school study begins in the 8th grade and state educational requirements are completed in the 11th. During the 12th grade, students take electives, have the option to attend courses at Hunter College (for transferable credit), undertake independent academic studies, and participate in internships around the city.

Students in grades 7 and 8 are required to take courses in communications and theater (a curriculum that includes drama, storytelling, and theater). Students in grades 7–9 must take both art and music, each for half a year, and then choose one to take in tenth grade. One of the four available foreign language courses (French, Latin, Mandarin, or Spanish) must be taken each year in grades 7–10, and Advanced Placement (AP) language electives are offered through the 12th grade. A year each of biology, chemistry, and physics must be completed in addition to the introductory science classes of life science and physical science in the 7th and 8th grades, respectively. During 7th and 8th grades, students must also participate in the school&#x27;s science fair; the fair is optional for older students. After the introductory 7th grade social studies course, 4 semesters of global studies (8th-9th grades) and 2 semesters of American history (10th grade) are followed by 2 semesters of 20th century history (11th grade). A series of English and mathematics courses are taught from 7th through 11th grades. (The math curriculum is split into a track of &quot;honors&quot; and a track of &quot;extended honors&quot; classes for students of different strengths after 8th grade). Two semesters of physical education are taught each year, including swimming in the 8th grade (held at Hunter College). In 9th grade, students are required to take a CPR course for one semester and a computer science course the other semester. Starting in their junior year, students are allowed to take a limited number of electives and AP courses. The senior year, however, is free of mandated courses except for a year of physical education electives and courses to fulfill leftover educational requirements.

Hunter&#x27;s English Department incorporates reading novels and writing analytical papers beginning in the 7th grade. Students have historically graduated with strong writing and reading comprehension skills, reflected by the school&#x27;s high average SAT scores in critical reading and writing, and by the number of students who have earned recognition by the Scholastic Writing Awards.

Upper-level electives and AP courses are offered by all six academic departments. AP courses include: AP Computer Science, AP Calculus AB and BC, AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics, AP European History, AP Chemistry, AP Physics C, AP Biology, AP Statistics, AP Spanish, AP French, AP Mandarin, and AP Latin (Virgil). The English Department previously offered AP English and Literature but has since replaced it with the elective Advanced Essay Writing. Other electives include: Introduction to African-American Studies, &quot;Race, Class, and Gender&quot;, International Relations, US Constitutional Law, Classical Mythology, Photography, Astrophysics, Advanced Art History I &amp; II, Organic Chemistry, Creative Writing, Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s Comedies and Romance/Shakespeare&#x27;s Tragedies and Histories, and Physiology. Hunter&#x27;s AP offerings are currently being evaluated by the Faculty and Curriculum Committee. The class of 2013 took 366 AP tests (≈1.8 per student) with an average score of 4.5.

There were 87 faculty members in 2013. 89% had advanced degrees. Many teachers are scientists, writers, artists, and musicians. Many come to Hunter with university-level teaching experience. The student/faculty ratio is 13:1, much lower than the city&#x27;s other selective public schools (e.g. Stuyvesant = 22:1; Bronx Science = 21:1; Brooklyn Tech = 21:1).

Nearly 99% of Hunter&#x27;s classes of 2002 through 2005 went directly to college, and about 25% of these students accepted admission into an Ivy League school. &quot;Worth&quot; reported that 9.4% of Hunter&#x27;s classes of 1998 through 2001 attended Harvard, Yale or Princeton (the highest rate of any public school in the United States).

In the graduating class of 2015, out of about 190 students, Hunter received 89 total acceptances from the Ivy League, and ultimately, 56 students (≈30%) matriculated into one of the eight Ivy League schools. There are six guidance counselors serving the student population. Each junior and senior is assigned a college guidance counselor.

Hunter students win many honors and awards during their high school careers, including numerous scholastic writing awards. Hunter wins approximately 23% of all New York State Scholastic Art and Writing Awards. 74 members of the Class of 2013 (38%) were National Merit or National Achievement Scholarship Semifinalists. Of particular fame are the winners of the Regeneron Science Talent Search (formerly Intel and Westinghouse STS), of which Hunter has had four: Amy Reichel in 1981, Adam Cohen (&#x27;97, now a professor in the Chemistry and Physics Departments at Harvard) in 1997, David L.V. Bauer (&#x27;05) in 2005, and Benjy Firester (&#x27;18) in 2018.

Publicly available data indicate that Hunter has both the highest average SAT score and the highest average ACT score of any school in the United States, public or private, though complete data is needed to be conclusive. For the graduating class of 2012, the average SAT score was a 2207. The class of 2013 averaged 2200 on the test and the class of 2016 averaged 2208. The class of 2013 scored an average of 32.6 on the ACT.

==Extracurricular activities==
Clubs are diverse in their topics, and include politics, film, music, and knitting. Clubs and organizations at Hunter are all student-run, with faculty members as advisers. During club open house, members of the student body have the opportunity to spend their lunch time meeting representatives of clubs. The school publishes a list of clubs available in this footnote&#x27;s link.

===Co-curricular activities===
Students can choose to further pursue their academic interests through school activities such as the National Economics Challenge, Hunter United Nations Society, Fed Challenge (economics), Mock Trial, Debate Team, Math Team, the Hunter Chess and Go Teams, Quiz Bowl, Science Bowl, History Bowl, FIRST Robotics, and the Washington Seminar. The Hunter Economics and Finance team was formed in 2013 by two juniors and one sophomore, who subsequently led the Hunter team to become National Champions of the David Ricardo division of the National Economics Challenge (run by the Council for Economic Education) in their inaugural year. Since then the team has become one of the top economics team in the country (placing students top 3 individually at the Harvard Precollege Economics Competition and repeatedly sweeping NEC states in all divisions). The Hunter Chess Team has won numerous tournaments and championships. The Washington Seminar on Government in Action was introduced in the 1950s; students selected for this program research public policy issues throughout the year; arrange meetings with various public figures in Washington, D.C.; and then meet with them for questioning and discussion regarding their researched issue during a three-day trip in May. The Mock Trial team was the top team from New York City in 2015 and the top team in the state in 2022. The debate team is completely student run and is nationally recognized and attends various tournaments throughout the year including tournaments at universities such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton. The Middle School debate team is a top-ranked team, that took the top three spots at the Middle School Public Debate Program&#x27;s National Invitational Tournament at Claremont McKenna College in 2013.

===Sports===
Hunter&#x27;s sports teams are extremely competitive given the school&#x27;s size; a large number, including both Girls&#x27; and Boys&#x27; varsity Lacrosse, Volleyball, Swimming, Golf, Wrestling, Cross-country, Fencing and Tennis, each usually place in the top 10 of the 543 high schools in New York City&#x27;s 
Public School Athletic League (PSAL), the country&#x27;s largest and oldest high school sports league.

The sports are cross-country (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity and junior varsity), soccer (boys&#x27; varsity, junior varsity and middle school and girls&#x27; varsity and middle school), swimming (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity), volleyball (boys&#x27; varsity and girls&#x27; varsity, junior varsity and middle school), golf (coed and girls&#x27; varsity), basketball (boys have two middle school teams, one junior varsity team, and one varsity team, while the girls&#x27; have one middle school and one varsity team), indoor track (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity, middle school, and recently it was extended to the elementary school as well), outdoor track (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity, middle school and elementary), baseball (boys&#x27; middle school and varsity), softball (girls&#x27; middle school and varsity), lacrosse (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity and junior varsity), tennis (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity), ultimate (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity), bowling (Co-Ed varsity), fencing (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity), badminton (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity), handball (coed varsity), and wrestling (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; varsity and co-ed middle school).

Many teams are called &quot;Hunter Hawks&quot; because the school mascot is a hawk.

In the winter of 2006, the boys&#x27; fencing team won the PSAL city championship for the second year in a row, beating rival school Stuyvesant in the finals. It has since captured the silver medal in winter 2008, losing to Stuyvesant in the final, and the bronze medal in winter 09, again losing to Stuyvesant, after beating them twice during an undefeated regular season to win the division championship. It proceeded win the city championship again in 2011, followed by bronze in 2012, and silver in 2013. Following another undefeated season, the team took first place in 2014, winning in a single-touch tie-breaker against rival Brooklyn Technical High School.

In the 2009–2014 seasons, the Girls&#x27; Varsity Fencing Team won five consecutive PSAL championships.

In 2011, both the Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; varsity lacrosse teams won the PSAL Bowl Division Championships. In 2013 Boys&#x27; Lacrosse won the City Championship against Tottenville. That season, prior to winning the City Championship, they were ranked third overall among all city schools, both public and private (after first-ranked Dalton and second-ranked Tottenville).

In the 2012 season, the Boys&#x27; Middle School Soccer Team were the Citywide PSAL Champions winning the finals against Salk.

In the 2016 season, the Girls&#x27; varsity golf team won the citywide PSAL championship, defeating Bronx Science High School 5–0 in the finals. The team went on to win the city championship in the 2017 and 2018 seasons as well, capturing the title for three years in a row. In the 2021 season, the Girls&#x27; Varsity Golf team won the citywide PSAL Championship by defeating Staten Island Technical High School 3–2 in the final.

==School events and traditions==

Students at Hunter can attend social events sponsored by the school administration, faculty and the student-run General Organization (G.O.). These include:
* &quot;Seventh Grade Picnic&quot;: an orientation and welcoming event held in Central Park at the end of September.
* &quot;Spirit Week&quot;: a week in October in which each day consists of activities centered around a &quot;theme&quot; (e.g. retro) as designated by the G.O. It was created in the 1990s as a replacement for a spring &quot;Field Day&quot;, which was once organized by the Athletic Association.
** &quot;Spirit Day&quot;: A Spirit Week event in which the entire high school community takes buses to Bear Mountain. Activities typically include a football game between teams composed of juniors and seniors, respectively; a bike trip to and from Bear Mountain; and a hike.
* &quot;Homecoming&quot;: a day in which the previous year&#x27;s graduates return to the school to revisit current students in December. There is usually a basketball game on this day.
* &quot;G.O. Breakfast&quot;: a morning prior to midterms in which the G.O. organizes a breakfast of donuts, coffee, and hot cocoa outside the G.O. Office.
* &quot;Senior Walkout&quot;: carried out on the first day of snowfall. Seniors leave class for the day to engage in snowball fights or pursue other activities outside of the school with parents of seniors providing refreshments. Originally an act of rebellion, in recent years the event has become a school-sanctioned ritual and is done in consultation with the administration.
* &quot;Carnival&quot;: an end-of-year event. It usually has a theme, live and recorded music, and stalls run by school clubs.
* &quot;Senior&quot; 
* &quot;Senior Week&quot;: traditionally the week after Carnival and before graduation. During this week, there are events designed to say goodbye to the graduating seniors.
** &quot;Senior Tea&quot;: A Senior Week event in which the senior class groups into their seventh grade class sections to reflect upon their time at Hunter. Faculty members typically join Senior Tea as well.
* &quot;Intel Trip&quot;: A trip run by the Hunter Science department that takes students to Washington D.C. to view Intel Science Project finalists and sightseeing in surrounding areas.
Several formal dances are arranged throughout the year:
* &quot;Prom&quot; is a similar event to many proms held all across the United States, consisting of formal dress and a sit-down dinner. The event is usually followed by an after-party at a student&#x27;s house. In June 2001, Prom was held at the World Trade Center (Windows on the World). Prom is held on a Thursday evening. Attendees return to school on Friday in their finery so students and teachers can admire their glamorous outfits.
* &quot;Semi-formal&quot; is the &quot;junior prom,&quot; held for eleventh graders in the spring.
* Lower-termers have their own annual dances, including dances for Valentine&#x27;s Day and Halloween for the seventh and eighth graders. In some years, there may also be themed dances; for example, in 2006, dances included the Halloween and Valentines&#x27; Dances as well as a &quot;Black, White, and Silver Dance&quot; for seventh and eighth graders.

<text>Schrödinger&#x27;s Kittens and the Search for Reality is a 1995 book by John Gribbin, in which the author attempts to explain the mysteries of modern quantum mechanics in a popular-scientific way. It is a sequel to his earlier book, &quot;In Search of Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot; (1984).

In his epilogue, Gribbin touches on what were then the most recent developments of string theory, and introduces the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics as the new &quot;mythology&quot; of our time. His argument does not refute the theory, but demonstrates how all theories can be true and mythological (depending on one&#x27;s perspective).

<text>The Wolf&#x27;s Lair (; ) was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s first Eastern Front military headquarters in World War II.

The headquarters was located in the Masurian woods, near the village of Görlitz (now Gierłoż), about 8 kilometres (5 miles) east of the town of Rastenburg (now Kętrzyn), in present-day Poland. The central complex and the &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s bunker were surrounded by three security zones guarded by two Schutzstaffel (SS) units: the &quot;SS-Begleitkommando des Führers&quot;, and the &quot;Reichssicherheitsdienst&quot;.

The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s armored &quot;Führerbegleitbrigade&quot; was held in readiness nearby but, as a part of the &quot;Heer&quot;&#x27;s elite &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; Division, was used to counter-attack Red Army break-throughs in Army Group Centre&#x27;s front and rescue cut-off &quot;Heer&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Fallschirmjager,&quot; and SS panzer troops.

The 20 July Plot, an assassination attempt against Hitler, took place at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair on 20 July 1944.

==Name==
The name &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; is derived from &quot;Wolf&quot;, a self-adopted nickname of Hitler. He began using the nickname in the 1920s and it was often how he was addressed by those in his intimate circle. &quot;Wolf&quot; was used in several titles of Hitler&#x27;s headquarters throughout occupied Europe, such as &quot;Wolfsschlucht&quot; I and II in Belgium and France, and &quot;Werwolf&quot; in Ukraine.

Although the standard translation in English is &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot;, a &quot;Schanze&quot; in German denotes a sconce, redoubt, or temporary fieldwork. The German translation for the lair of a wolf is &quot;Höhle&quot; (cave) or &quot;Bau&quot; (dwelling).

==History==
As part of the preparations for the coming Operation Barbarossa, the decision was made in late 1940 to build a military headquarters for the &quot;Führer&quot; in Eastern Europe, similar in concept to the &quot;Felsennest&quot; in Western Europe. Like the &quot;Felsennest&quot;, the new headquarters had to be as close to the front as possible, but far enough to be safe from enemy forces.

Eventually, a top-secret site was chosen in the middle of the Masurian woods, in what was then East Prussia, far from roads and urban areas, and accessible only by a single railway and small airstrip. To maintain secrecy, locals were told that the construction works were for a new cement factory. The Organisation Todt completed construction of the entire complex by 21 June 1941.

Hitler first arrived at the headquarters on 24 June 1941, two days after &quot;Barbarossa&quot; commenced. At its peak, over 2,000 people lived and worked at the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot;, including food-tasters to sample Hitler&#x27;s food before he ate it to guard him against being poisoned. Additional construction work began in mid-1944 to enlarge and reinforce many of the original buildings on the site on Hitler&#x27;s orders, although the work was never completed because of the Red Army&#x27;s rapid advance during the Baltic Offensive.

Hitler left the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot; for the final time in November 1944 after having spent over 800 days there, the longest he had stayed at any place over the course of the war, during a -year period.

== Layout ==
The buildings within the complex were camouflaged with bushes, grass, and artificial trees on the flat roofs; netting was also erected between buildings and the surrounding forest so that the installation looked like unbroken dense woodland from the air. The site consisted of three concentric security zones.

*&quot;Sperrkreis 1&quot; (Security Zone 1) was located at the heart of the Wolf&#x27;s Lair, the perimeter was ringed by steel fencing and guarded by the SS &quot;Reichssicherheitsdienst&quot; (RSD). Within the compound, security was managed by &quot;Dienststelle&quot; I (command I) from the &quot;SS-Begleitkommando des Führers&quot; (FBK) which operated under the auspices of &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Bruno Gesche. These were the only armed guards Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapons and were never searched whereas the RSD were required to remain at positions some distance away from Hitler. The zone contained the Führer Bunker and ten other camouflaged bunkers built from steel-reinforced concrete. These shelters protected members of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle such as Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring, Wilhelm Keitel, and Alfred Jodl. Hitler&#x27;s accommodation was on the shaded northern side of the Führer Bunker. Both Hitler&#x27;s and Keitel&#x27;s bunkers had additional rooms where military conferences could be held.
*&quot;Sperrkreis 2&quot; (Security Zone 2) surrounded the inner zone. The area housed the quarters of several Reich Ministers such as Fritz Todt, Albert Speer, and Joachim von Ribbentrop. It also housed the quarters of the personnel who worked in the Wolf&#x27;s Lair and the military barracks for the RSD.
*&quot;Sperrkreis 3&quot; (Security Zone 3) was the heavily fortified outer security area which surrounded the two inner zones. It was defended by land mines and the &quot;Führerbegleitbrigade&quot; (FBB), a special armoured security unit from &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; which manned guardhouses, watchtowers, and checkpoints.

A facility for Army headquarters was also located near the complex. The FBK and RSD had responsibility for Hitler&#x27;s personal security within the site, while external protection of the complex was provided by the FBB, which had become a regiment by July 1944. The FBB was equipped with tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other heavy weapons. Any approaching aircraft could be detected up to from the site. Additional troops were also stationed about away.

===Reinforcements===

Hitler&#x27;s secretary, Traudl Junge, recalled that Hitler repeatedly spoke in late 1943 or early 1944 of a possible bomber attack on the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; by the Western Allies. She quoted Hitler as saying, &quot;They know &quot;exactly&quot; where we are, and sometime they&#x27;re going to destroy everything here with carefully aimed bombs. I expect them to attack any day.&quot;

According to Speer, between 28 July 1941 and 20 March 1942, Hitler left Rastenburg only four times for a total of 57 days. Afterwards, Hitler spent the next three months in Obersalzberg before returning to Rastenburg for the next nine months.

Hitler&#x27;s entourage returned to the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; from an extended summer stay at the Berghof in July 1944. The previous small bunkers had been replaced by the Organisation Todt with &quot;heavy, colossal structures&quot; of reinforced concrete as defense against the feared air attack. According to Armaments Minister Albert Speer, &quot;some 36,000,000 marks were spent for bunkers in Rastenburg [Wolf&#x27;s Lair].&quot;

Hitler&#x27;s bunker had become the largest, &quot;a positive fortress&quot; containing &quot;a maze of passages, rooms and halls.&quot; Junge wrote, &quot;We had air-raid warnings every day&quot; in the period between the 20 July assassination attempt and Hitler&#x27;s final departure from the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; in November 1944, &quot;but there was never more than a single aircraft circling over the forest, and no bombs were dropped. All the same, Hitler took the danger very seriously, and thought all these reconnaissance flights were in preparation for the big raid he was expecting.&quot;

No air attack ever came. It has never been revealed whether the Western Allies knew of the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot;″s location and importance. The Soviet Union was unaware of both the location and the scale of the complex until the site was uncovered by its forces during their advance towards Berlin in early 1945.

==Hitler&#x27;s daily routine==
Hitler would begin his day by taking a walk alone with his dog around 10 a.m. or so, and at 10:30 a.m. he looked at the mail that had been delivered by air or courier train. A noon situation briefing would be convened, either in Keitel&#x27;s or Jodl&#x27;s bunker, and frequently ran for two hours. This was followed by lunch at 2 p.m. in the dining hall. Hitler invariably sat in the same seat between Jodl and Otto Dietrich, while Keitel, Martin Bormann, and Göring&#x27;s adjutant General Karl Bodenschatz sat opposite him.

After lunch, Hitler dealt with non-military matters for the remainder of the afternoon. Coffee was served around 5 p.m., followed by a second military briefing by Jodl at 6 p.m. Dinner could also last as long as two hours, beginning at 7:30 p.m., after which films were shown in the cinema. Hitler then retired to his private quarters where he gave monologues to his entourage till late, usually going to sleep around 3 or 4 a.m. Occasionally, Hitler and his entourage listened to gramophone records of Beethoven symphonies, selections from Wagner or other operas, or German lieder.

==Assassination attempt==
On Thursday 20 July 1944 an attempt was made to kill Hitler at the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot;. It was organized by a group of acting and retired army officers, as well as some civilians, who wanted to remove Hitler and establish a new democratic government in Germany that would negotiate a peaceful end to the war with the Allies before Germany&#x27;s inevitable defeat, which had become apparent to both sides by then. However, the main challenge facing the conspirators was that Hitler&#x27;s habit of last-minute changes to his schedule had led to the failure of attempts by others to kill him.

Eventually, the conspirators chose the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot; as a viable location to target Hitler because it was the only place where they were sure they could get close enough to kill him. Staff officer Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg volunteered to carry a bomb hidden in a briefcase into one of the daily military briefings usually held in the bunkers, in the hope that the heavy reinforcements of the bunkers could be turned against the &quot;Führer&quot; through the shockwave of the blast reverberating off the heavily reinforced walls of the room and certainly killing him.

However, on the day of the planned assassination, the location of the meeting was unexpectedly changed to a light brick hut due to Hitler&#x27;s complaints about the immense heat within the bunkers that day. This change in venue, along with other factors, such as Hitler unexpectedly calling the meeting earlier than anticipated, would contribute to the eventual failure of the plot. Despite this change in plans, Stauffenberg went ahead with carrying out the plot. He carried the briefcase containing the bomb into the conference hut, making a request to be placed close to Hitler on grounds that he had trouble hearing due to his injuries sustained while fighting in North Africa, which would ensure that the bomb would be close enough to Hitler to be effective.

The bomb exploded at precisely 12:42 p.m., with Stauffenberg having excused himself from the meeting a few minutes before. The interior of the building was devastated, four officers were injured and would later die of their wounds but Hitler was only slightly injured. This was due to the fact that one of the other officers present at the meeting had, for his own comfort, moved the briefcase from where it had been put by Stauffenberg close to Hitler and placed it against one of the legs of the solid oak table being used for the meeting. Consequently, the thick, heavy table absorbed most of the blast and this, along with the collapse of some of the hut&#x27;s thin walls thus dissipating the shockwave, saved the &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s life.

Even before the bomb detonated, Stauffenberg and his adjutant, Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, had already begun their departure for Berlin where they planned to take control of the country alongside their fellow conspirators. Their escape involved passing through various security zones that controlled all access around the site. After a short delay at the RSD guard post just outside &quot;Sperrkreis&quot; 1, they were allowed to leave by vehicle. The two officers were then driven down the southern exit road towards the military airstrip near Rastenburg.
The alarm had been raised by the time they reached the guardhouse at the perimeter of &quot;Sperrkreis&quot; 2. According to the official RSHA report, &quot;at first, the guard refused passage until Stauffenberg persuaded him to contact the adjutant to the compound commander who then finally authorized clearance&quot;. It was between here and the final checkpoint of &quot;Sperrkreis&quot; 3 that Haeften tossed another briefcase from the car containing an unused second bomb. The two men reached the outer limit of the security zones and were allowed to catch their plane back to army general headquarters in Berlin.

The attempted assassination was derived from Operation Valkyrie, a covert plan officially sanctioned by Hitler for the Reserve Army to take control and suppress any revolt in the country in the event of his untimely death, which the conspirators adapted to suit their purpose. Unfortunately for the conspirators, news soon arrived from the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot; that Hitler was still alive. Upon hearing from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels that Hitler was indeed alive, as well as speaking to the &quot;Führer&quot; himself, Major Otto Ernst Remer, in command of the Reserve Army&#x27;s troops in Berlin still loyal to the regime, was fully convinced of Hitler&#x27;s survival and he quickly re-established control of key government buildings and arrested the conspirators.

That same evening, Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators were summarily executed by gunshot outside the &quot;Bendlerblock&quot; in Berlin.

On 20 August 1944, Hitler personally presented survivors of the bomb blast with a &quot;20 July 1944 Wound Badge&quot;. Next-of-kin of those killed in the blast were also given this award.

==Destruction and capture==

The Red Army reached the borders of East Prussia during the Baltic offensive in October 1944. Hitler departed from the Wolf&#x27;s Lair for the final time on Monday, 20 November 1944, when the Soviet advance reached Angerburg (now Węgorzewo), away. Two days later, the order was given to destroy the complex.

The demolition took place on the night of 24–25 January 1945, ten days after the start of the Red Army&#x27;s Vistula–Oder offensive. Tons of explosives were used; one bunker required an estimated of TNT. Most of the buildings were only partially destroyed due to their immense size and reinforced structures.

The Red Army captured the abandoned remains of the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; on 27 January without firing a shot, the same day that Auschwitz was liberated farther south.

==Historical site==

Following the war, more than 54,000 land mines were removed from the area, together with abandoned ordnance, and the entire site was left to decay by Poland&#x27;s Communist government. Since the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, the Wolf&#x27;s Lair has been developed as a tourist attraction. Visitors can make day trips from Warsaw or Gdańsk. Hotels and restaurants have grown up near the site. Plans have periodically been proposed to restore the area, including the installation of historical exhibits.

As of 2019, the site was drawing almost 300,000 visitors a year. The Srokowo Forest District, which manages the site, announced renovation and restoration plans for the historic site, including new accommodation options, expanded historical exhibitions, and other upgrades to improve visitor experience. Critics worried that the planned changes could turn the site into a place for neo-Nazi pilgrimages, although the District&#x27;s spokesperson said that they would &quot;make every effort&quot; to maintain &quot;due seriousness and respect for historical truth&quot;. Pawel Machcewicz, a Polish historian who specializes in World War II, said, &quot;[T]he scars left by the war should be preserved and presented as a lesson, a warning... Exhibitions should explain the history, contextualise the place, but not completely overshadow it.&quot; 

In February 2023, the Srokowo Forest District officials announced that the renovation of the &quot;Wilczy Szaniec&quot; site had begun and is slated to be completed by the end of 2024. The project will include expanding and renovating the hotel and restaurant building, adding a new conference room, redesigning the exhibition space, as well as constructing a new observation deck.

In 2024, archaeologists exploring the complex&#x27;s former living quarters of Hermann Göring reported discovering five human skeletons (three adults, a teenager and a baby believed to be a family) missing their hands and feet and lacking any traces of clothing or personal objects buried under the brick residence. Alongside each of the skeletons thunderbolt stones (or Donnerkeil)—bullet-shaped fossils of extinct squid-like creatures called belemnoids—were found.

<text>The Ibar (, ), also known as the Ibër and Ibri (), is a river that flows through eastern Montenegro, northern Kosovo and central Serbia, with a total length of . The river begins in the Hajla mountain, in Rožaje, eastern Montenegro, and passes through southwestern Serbia and northern Kosovo, where it leads back into Serbia to flow into the West Morava river near Kraljevo, central Serbia.

The Ibar belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. Its own drainage area is , with an average discharge of 60 m3/s at the mouth. It is not navigable.

== Etymology ==
Some scholars has theorized that the word Ibar is related to the Basque word for &quot;river&quot; (&quot;i-ba/r/i&quot;), which is also how the Ebro river in Spain received its name. Other scholars have suggested that the name is derived from Greek, given that the river&#x27;s ancient name was &quot;Hiberus&quot;. A Greek origin seems likely, since other rivers also bear the name Ancient Greek Ἕβρος(Hébros) or Modern Greek Έβρος(Évros), meaning &#x27;wide river&#x27;. An alternative hypothesis is that Hiberus is borrowed from Thracian ebros meaning &#x27;splasher&#x27;.

== Upper course ==
The Ibar originates from six springs on the Hajla mountain in eastern Montenegro. It generally flows north-east, passing through Ibarac, Rožaje, Radetina and Bać, after which it enters Serbia. Passing through the most southern part of Raška District, it flows along several small villages. In this whole area, the river has no major tributaries, but many short streams which flow into it from surrounding mountains. This part also represents the route of one of two main roads connecting Serbia and Montenegro (&quot;Ibarska magistrala&quot;).

== Middle course ==
Continuing south, the river enters Kosovo and passes through Gazivode, Zubin Potok, Ugljare, Zupče and Shipol, reaching the city of Mitrovica. There, it makes a sharp, elbow turn to the north, flowing through Zvečan, Slatina, Sočanica, Leposavić, Dren and Lešak, entering southwestern Serbia at the village of Jarinje.

=== In Kosovo ===
At Kosovo, the river is dammed, creating the artificial Gazivoda Lake (area , altitude , depth ). Water from the lake is used for industrial and mining facilities in the Trepča area. Below Gazivoda, another reservoir is created, the Pridvorica Lake. These lakes allow irrigation of an area of 300 km2, representing part of a plan, never completed, of a huge Ibar-Lepenac Hydrosystem, which was supposed to regulate the Ibar-Sitnica-Lepenac watercourse (including ecological protection, irrigation and power production).

At Mitrovica, the river enters a minerals and ore-rich area of the western slopes of Kopaonik mountain, which it follows for the next or so. The area is especially rich in lead, zinc and silver (Stari Trg, Trepča and Leposavić mines).

Right on its elbow turn, the Ibar receives its longest (right) tributary, the Sitnica.

=== In Serbia ===
Entering southwestern Serbia again, the river receives its major tributaries: the Raška, Studenica and Lopatnica, from the left, and the Jošanica.

In this section, the river has carved the long and deep Ibar gorge, which is the natural route for the major road in this part of Serbia, the Ibar Highway. This stretch of the river is famous for its pinched meanders and gigantic whirlpools. The whole area is long (meridionally stretched), and at Serbia&#x27;s parts is popularly divided into several colorfully named valleys:

* &quot;Dolina istorije&quot; (Serbian: Долина историје; Valley of history), consisting of ruins of the medieval city of Maglič, the monastery of Studenica, the monastery of Žiča, the monastery of Gradac, etc.;
* &quot;Dolina jorgovana&quot; (Serbian: Долина јоргована; Valley of the lilacs);
* &quot;Dolina banja&quot; (Serbian: Долина бања; Valley of the spas), with many spas and springs, such as Jošanička Banja, Mataruška Banja and Bogutovačka Banja.

The gorge is carved between the mountains of Golija, Čemerno and Troglav from the east, and Kopaonik, Željin and Stolovi from the west.

This is a continuation of Kopaonik&#x27;s mining-rich area, including deposits of iron ore (Kopaonik, Raška), nickel (Kopaonik), asbestos (Brvenik), magnesite (Bela Stena) and hard coal (Baljevac, Ušće and Jarando).

The Ibar has previously gained notoriety as being the most polluted river in Serbia (together with its major tributary, the Sitnica), especially from frequent spills of extremely poisonous phenol, which causes constant problems for the population of Kraljevo, since the city uses the river&#x27;s water for public waterworks.

== Electricity ==

In 2009, governments of Serbia and Italy signed an agreement which included construction of the &quot;Ibar hydropower plants&quot; complex, with ten hydroelectric power plants on Ibar. A detailed project was drafted, all studies were conducted, a joint Serbian-Italian company for construction of the facilities was formed, and the parliament ratified the agreement. After the 2011 Italian government change, Italy also changed its abroad investment policies and effectively quit the agreement. Power plants were to be built between the village of Bojanići and locality of Lakat, near Mataruška Banja. The entire section is administratively part of the City of Kraljevo. The project included 10 cascade dams, high, with all plants being run-of-the-river type. Therefore, no settlements will be relocated as the flooding of the valley would be minimal. The existing road would have to be relocated at four locations. 

The planned dams were Bojanići, Gokčanica, Ušće, Glavica, Cerje, Gradina, Bela Glava, Dobre Strane, Maglič, and Lakat, with the total capacity of 450 GW-h. All dams would have fish ladders and kayaking paths. Studies envisioned tourism development with ten small, cascade reservoirs, but also concluded that the stable water levels woul prevent floods and benefit the fish spawning, including species presently not inhabiting Ibar, like carp or zander, which could be introduced. Architect Milan Lojanica was hired to design the dams. He designed them in the spirit of the Serbian medieval architecture and the Nemanjić period. Ratification of the agreement expired in 2021, but some experts publicly revived the idea in January 2023, as the project is generally not considered complicated and expensive.

It and White Bluffs were depopulated in 1943 in order to make room for the nuclear production facility known as the Hanford Site. The town was located in what is now the &quot;100F&quot; sector of the site.

The original town, named for the judge and irrigation company president Cornelius H. Hanford, was settled in 1907 on land bought by the local power and water utility. In 1913, the town had a spur railroad link to the transcontinental Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, also known as &quot;the electric railroad&quot;. By 1925 the booming town enjoyed high agricultural demand and provided a hotel, bank, and elementary and high schools.

The federal government condemned Hanford to make way for the Hanford Site. Residents were given a thirty-day eviction notice on March 9, 1943. Most buildings were razed, with the exception of the former Hanford High School. It was used during World War II as the construction management office.

Hanford High School, albeit marred from SWAT practice, still stands today and can be seen from the Hanford tour bus operated by the U.S. government. Hanford is now protected as part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park.

<text>Julia Kavanagh (7 January 1824 – 28 October 1877) was an Irish novelist, born at Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland—then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Her numerous contributions to literature have classified her as one of the non-canonical minor novelists of the Victorian period (1837–1901). Although she is mainly known for the novel and tales she wrote, she also published important non-fiction works that explored the theme of female political, moral and philosophical contributions to society. The appeal of her works is represented by the fact that several of her works have been translated into French, German, Italian and Swedish. Her texts also reached North America, where some of her works appeared in &quot;Littell&#x27;s Living Age&quot;, an American magazine. Moreover, she was known to celebrated writers of domestic fiction such as Charles Dickens.

==Biography==
Born in Thurles, a small town in Munster, Ireland, Julia was the only child of Morgan Kavanagh (died 1874), author of various philological works and some poems, and Bridget Kavanagh (née Fitzpatrick). On 9 January she was baptized in the &quot;Big Chapel,&quot; a Catholic church, where the clerk misspelled her name as &quot;Cavanah.&quot; Before she was a year old, her family moved to London, and soon after to Paris. Julia spent several years of her early life with her parents in Paris, laying the foundations for a mastery of the French language and gaining insight into French modes of thought, eventually perfected by her later frequent and long residences in France. Her father, Morgan, was a language teacher and he also published books of poetry, novels, and several works on philology. An attempt to capitalize on his daughter&#x27;s literary fame by adding her as co-author to one of his published novels brought Julia much annoyance.

Kavanagh&#x27;s literary career began in 1844 at the age of 20, when she moved with her mother, after separating from her father in France. Thereafter she supported herself and her almost blind mother, Bridget (a lifelong companion), with her writing career. In June 1850, she requested to meet Charlotte Brontë, who later described her as &#x27;a little, almost dwarfish figure to which even I had to look down [Charlotte Brontë was less than five feet tall] - not deformed - that is - not hunchbacked but long-armed and with a large head and (at first sight) a strange face.&#x27; At first she started to write small essays and tales for journals and newspapers. Among the different journals she wrote for were &quot;Chambers Edinburgh Journal, Household Words, All the Year Round, The Month, People&#x27;s Journal, Popular Record, Temple Bar,&quot; and &quot;Argosy&quot;. Once she had acquired some reputation she started to write her own books. Her first book was &quot;Three Paths&quot; (1847), a story for the young; but her first work that attracted notice was &quot;Madeleine, a Tale of Auvergne&quot; (1848), a story of &quot;heroic charity and living faith founded on fact&quot;.

Julia and her mother were again living in Paris from the early 1860s, but moved to Rouen and then to Nice upon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Julia died after a fall in Nice in 1877, still unmarried and a lifelong devout Catholic. Her last words, in French, were: &quot;Oh Mama! how silly I am to have fallen&quot;. She is buried with her mother in the Cimitiere du Chateau, on the hill above the Old Town to the east of Nice. A notice of her death appeared in &quot;The Belfast Newsletter.&quot; Bridget continued to live in Nice until her death in 1888. In 1884 she donated a painting of Julia by Henri Chanet to the National Gallery of Ireland.

==Works==
The scenes of Kavanagh&#x27;s stories are almost always set in France. Her style is domestic, simple and pleasing, aimed at younger woman readers; her main characters tend to be strong independent and resourceful women. She was popular and had a loyal readership. She was also a prolific contributor to periodical literature, and also wrote many biographical sketches. Modern scholars see a pronounced awareness of gender politics in Kavanagh&#x27;s writing and view her as a writer whose works consciously exposed the anomalies of social and sexual difference while still adhering to the conventions of the time.

<text>John Ward Melville (January 5, 1887 – June 5, 1977) was an American philanthropist and businessman active in the &quot;Three Villages&quot; in western Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. He donated 400 acres of land and money to establish Stony Brook University in 1957, which has developed as a major public research institution. He played a major role in the development of Melville Corporation, known today as CVS Health.

==Early life==
Mellville was born in Brooklyn to businessman and philanthropist Frank Melville Jr. (1860–1935) and his wife, Jennie Florence (née MacConnell) Melville (1857–1939). His father was a nephew of sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward. He attended Columbia University, where he was active in the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; and the Philolexian Society.

Melville married Dorothy Bigelow, who helped him continue the civic work of his parents such as the restoration of the Colonial village in Stony Brook. The couple had four children.

==Career==
Following graduation in 1909, Melville joined his father&#x27;s shoe company, Melville Corporation. Upon the United States&#x27; entrance into World War I, Melville became a soldier of the U.S. Army and the firm mass produced shoes for the Army&#x27;s soldiers.

After the war, Melville continued to work in his father&#x27;s company, eventually taking control of it in 1922. At the time, he created the Thom McAn shoe line, which became popular. The brand, was named after the golfer Thomas McCann, focused on fine shoes and reached hundreds of stores before it declined. He was CEO of the corporation.

Melville was also part of Macy&#x27;s Board of Directors and he retired in 1953.

===Philanthropy and civic activities===
Melville settled in the Stony Brook area in western Suffolk County on Long Island, where he owned much land. He served as a member of the school board in Setauket, where he donated the land for the high school. From 1948 to 1949 he was the 66th President of the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Society of the State of New York.

Melville was very active in philanthropic works around the &quot;Three Village&quot; area (Stony Brook, Setauket, and Old Field) and the surrounding towns. He supported the restoration and preservation of historic buildings in the area to encourage his vision of a New England village. Under his leadership, Stony Brook was organized around a town green and the Stony Brook Village Center was completed in 1941. He also supported conservation of natural areas, including the West Meadow Beach.

Another interest was education and he developed land for the high school in Setauket, which was named for him. His larger contribution was the donation of 400 acres of land and money to New York state to establish what is now the Stony Brook University, which was founded in 1957. First operating with classes in Oyster Bay, its current campus opened in 1962. Emphasizing teacher education in mathematics and sciences, the university developed into a leading public research institution in medicine and science and was named as one of New York&#x27;s two flagship universities by Governor Kathy Hochul in 2022. Governor W. Averell Harriman appointed Melville as chairman of the Council of the university, where he served for some years.

==Personal life==
After joining his father in his company in 1909, Melville married Dorothy Bigelow (1894–1989), a daughter of Isabella Lyall and Charles Emerson Bigelow. In 1924, the Melvilles purchased a property in Old Field on Long Island. They expanded the home, a Cape Cod style cottage built by Alexander Hamilton Jr., a grandson of the first Treasury Secretary, and his wife, Elizabeth Nicoll Hamilton, into a 22-room mansion which they called Wide Water. The living room at Wide Water is believed to be the original cottage. The couple had two sons (Frank and David B. Melville) and two daughters, including:

* Margaret Melville (1919–2000), who married James Hancock Blackwell Jr. and were cofounders of the equestrian American Driving Society.
* Ruth Melville (–1995), a philanthropist who married F. Henry Berlin Jr.

Melville died in 1977 and is buried in Setauket at the Caroline Church and Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==
*Numerous organizations are named after him, including the local high school, Ward Melville High School in Setauket. 
*The main library at Stony Brook University is named for his father.
*The Ward Melville Social and Behavioral Sciences building at Stony Brook University was named in his honor.

<doc id="533789" wikidata="Q902419" url="?curid=533789" title="Magnetorheological fluid">
<text>A magnetorheological fluid (MR fluid, or MRF) is a type of smart fluid in a carrier fluid, usually a type of oil. When subjected to a magnetic field, the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity, to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid. Importantly, the yield stress of the fluid when in its active (&quot;on&quot;) state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity. The upshot is that the fluid&#x27;s ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet, which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications.

MR fluid is different from a ferrofluid which has smaller particles. MR fluid particles are primarily on the micrometre-scale and are too dense for Brownian motion to keep them suspended (in the lower density carrier fluid). Ferrofluid particles are primarily nanoparticles that are suspended by Brownian motion and generally will not settle under normal conditions. As a result, these two fluids have very different applications.

==Mechanism==
The magnetic particles, which are typically micrometer or nanometer scale spheres or ellipsoids, are suspended within the carrier oil and distributed randomly in suspension under normal circumstances, as below.

When a magnetic field is applied, however, the microscopic particles (usually in the 0.1–10 μm range) align themselves along the lines of magnetic flux, see below.

==Material behavior==
To understand and predict the behavior of the MR fluid it is necessary to model the fluid mathematically, a task slightly complicated by the varying material properties (such as yield stress). 
As mentioned above, smart fluids are such that they have a low viscosity in the absence of an applied magnetic field, but become quasi-solid with the application of such a field. In the case of MR fluids (and ER), the fluid actually assumes properties comparable to a solid when in the activated (&quot;on&quot;) state, up until a point of yield (the shear stress above which shearing occurs). This yield stress (commonly referred to as apparent yield stress) is dependent on the magnetic field applied to the fluid, but will reach a maximum point after which increases in magnetic flux density have no further effect, as the fluid is then magnetically saturated. The behavior of a MR fluid can thus be considered similar to a Bingham plastic, a material model which has been well-investigated.

However, MR fluid does not exactly follow the characteristics of a Bingham plastic. For example, below the yield stress (in the activated or &quot;on&quot; state), the fluid behaves as a viscoelastic material, with a complex modulus that is also known to be dependent on the magnetic field intensity. MR fluids are also known to be subject to shear thinning, whereby the viscosity above yield decreases with increased shear rate. Furthermore, the behavior of MR fluids when in the &quot;off&quot; state is also non-Newtonian and temperature dependent, however it deviates little enough for the fluid to be ultimately considered as a Bingham plastic for a simple analysis.

Thus our model of MR fluid behavior in the shear mode becomes:

:formula_1

Where formula_2 = shear stress; formula_3 = yield stress; formula_4 = Magnetic field intensity formula_5 = Newtonian viscosity; formula_6 is the velocity gradient in the z-direction.

=== Shear strength ===

Low shear strength has been the primary reason for limited range of applications. In the absence of external pressure the maximum shear strength is about 100 kPa. If the fluid is compressed in the magnetic field direction and the compressive stress is 2 MPa, the shear strength is raised to 1100 kPa. If the standard magnetic particles are replaced with elongated magnetic particles, the shear strength is also improved.
=== Particle sedimentation ===

Ferroparticles settle out of the suspension over time due to the inherent density difference between the particles and their carrier fluid. The rate and degree to which this occurs is one of the primary attributes considered in industry when implementing or designing an MR device. Surfactants are typically used to offset this effect, but at a cost of the fluid&#x27;s magnetic saturation, and thus the maximum yield stress exhibited in its activated state.

=== Common MR fluid surfactants ===

MR fluids often contain surfactants including, but not limited to:

* oleic acid
* tetramethylammonium hydroxide
* citric acid
* soy lecithin

These surfactants serve to decrease the rate of ferroparticle settling, of which a high rate is an unfavorable characteristic of MR fluids. The ideal MR fluid would never settle, but developing this ideal fluid is as highly improbable as developing a perpetual motion machine according to our current understanding of the laws of physics. Surfactant-aided prolonged settling is typically achieved in one of two ways: by addition of surfactants, and by addition of spherical ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Addition of the nanoparticles results in the larger particles staying suspended longer since the non-settling nanoparticles interfere with the settling of the larger micrometre-scale particles due to Brownian motion. Addition of a surfactant allows micelles to form around the ferroparticles. A surfactant has a polar head and non-polar tail (or vice versa), one of which adsorbs to a ferroparticle, while the non-polar tail (or polar head) sticks out into the carrier medium, forming an inverse or regular micelle, respectively, around the particle. This increases the effective particle diameter. Steric repulsion then prevents heavy agglomeration of the particles in their settled state, which makes fluid remixing (particle redispersion) occur far faster and with less effort. For example, magnetorheological dampers will remix within one cycle with a surfactant additive, but are nearly impossible to remix without them.

While surfactants are useful in prolonging the settling rate in MR fluids, they also prove detrimental to the fluid&#x27;s magnetic properties (specifically, the magnetic saturation), which is commonly a parameter which users wish to maximize in order to increase the maximum apparent yield stress. Whether the anti-settling additive is nanosphere-based or surfactant-based, their addition decreases the packing density of the ferroparticles while in its activated state, thus decreasing the fluids on-state/activated viscosity, resulting in a &quot;softer&quot; activated fluid with a lower maximum apparent yield stress. While the on-state viscosity (the &quot;hardness&quot; of the activated fluid) is also a primary concern for many MR fluid applications, it is a primary fluid property for the majority of their commercial and industrial applications and therefore a compromise must be met when considering on-state viscosity, maximum apparent yields stress, and settling rate of an MR fluid.

==Modes of operation and applications==
An MR fluid is used in one of three main modes of operation, these being flow mode, shear mode and squeeze-flow mode. These modes involve, respectively, fluid flowing as a result of pressure gradient between two stationary plates; fluid between two plates moving relative to one another; and fluid between two plates moving in the direction perpendicular to their planes. In all cases the magnetic field is perpendicular to the planes of the plates, so as to restrict fluid in the direction parallel to the plates.

===Flow mode (a.k.a. valve mode)===

===Shear mode===

===Squeeze-flow mode===

The applications of these various modes are numerous. Flow mode can be used in dampers and shock absorbers, by using the movement to be controlled to force the fluid through channels, across which a magnetic field is applied. Shear mode is particularly useful in clutches and brakes - in places where rotational motion must be controlled. Squeeze-flow mode, on the other hand, is most suitable for applications controlling small, millimeter-order movements but involving large forces. This particular flow mode has seen the least investigation so far.
Overall, between these three modes of operation, MR fluids can be applied successfully to a wide range of applications. However, some limitations exist which are necessary to mention here.

==Limitations==
Although smart fluids are rightly seen as having many potential applications, they are limited in commercial feasibility for the following reasons:

* High density, due to presence of iron, makes them heavy. However, operating volumes are small, so while this is a problem, it is not insurmountable.
* High-quality fluids are expensive.
* Fluids are subject to thickening after prolonged use and need replacing.
* Settling of Ferro-particles can be a problem for some applications.
* Cannot operate at extremely High/Low temperatures

Commercial applications do exist, as mentioned, but will continue to be few until these problems (particularly cost) are overcome.

==Advances in the 2000s==
Studies published beginning in the late 2000s which explore the effect of varying the aspect ratio of the ferromagnetic particles have shown several improvements over conventional MR fluids. Nanowire-based fluids show no sedimentation after qualitative observation over a period of three months. This observation has been attributed to a lower close-packing density due to decreased symmetry of the wires compared to spheres, as well as the structurally supportive nature of a nanowire lattice held together by remnant magnetization. Further, they show a different range of loading of particles (typically measured in either volume or weight fraction) than conventional sphere- or ellipsoid-based fluids. Conventional commercial fluids exhibit a typical loading of 30 to 90 wt%, while nanowire-based fluids show a percolation threshold of ~0.5 wt% (depending on the aspect ratio). They also show a maximum loading of ~35 wt%, since high aspect ratio particles exhibit a larger per particle excluded volume as well as inter-particle tangling as they attempt to rotate end-over-end, resulting in a limit imposed by high off-state apparent viscosity of the fluids. This range of loadings suggest a new set of applications are possible which may have not been possible with conventional sphere-based fluids.

Newer studies have focused on dimorphic magnetorheological fluids, which are conventional sphere-based fluids in which a fraction of the spheres, typically 2 to 8 wt%, are replaced with nanowires. These fluids exhibit a much lower sedimentation rate than conventional fluids, yet exhibit a similar range of loading as conventional commercial fluids, making them also useful in existing high-force applications such as damping. Moreover, they also exhibit an improvement in apparent yield stress of 10% across those amounts of particle substitution.

Another way to increase the performance of magnetorheological fluids is to apply a pressure to them. In particular the properties in term of yield strength can be increased up to ten times in shear mode and up five times in flow mode. The motivation of this behaviour is the increase in the ferromagnetic particles friction, as described by the semiempirical magneto-tribological model by Zhang et al. Even though applying a pressure strongly improves the magnetorheological fluids behaviour, particular attention must be paid in terms of mechanical resistance and chemical compatibility of the sealing system used.

==Applications==
The application set for MR fluids is vast, and it expands with each advance in the dynamics of the fluid.

===Mechanical engineering===
Magnetorheological dampers of various applications have been and continue to be developed. These dampers are mainly used in heavy industry with applications such as heavy motor damping, operator seat/cab damping in construction vehicles, and more.

As of 2006, materials scientists and mechanical engineers are collaborating to develop stand-alone seismic dampers which, when positioned anywhere within a building, will operate within the building&#x27;s resonance frequency, absorbing detrimental shock waves and oscillations within the structure, giving these dampers the ability to make any building earthquake-proof, or at least earthquake-resistant.

MR fluids&#x27; technology can applied among high-end auxiliary equipment that has flexible fixtures at CNC machining. It can hold irregular surfaces and difficult-to-grasp products. 

===Military and defense===
The U.S. Army Research Office is currently funding research into using MR fluid to enhance body armor. In 2003, researchers stated they were five to ten years away from making the fluid bullet resistant. In addition, HMMWVs, and various other all-terrain vehicles employ dynamic MR shock absorbers and/or dampers.

===Optics===
Magnetorheological finishing, a magnetorheological fluid-based optical polishing method, has proven to be highly precise. It was used in the construction of the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s corrective lens. 
===Automotive===
If the shock absorbers of a vehicle&#x27;s suspension are filled with magnetorheological fluid instead of a plain oil or gas, and the channels which allow the damping fluid to flow between the two chambers is surrounded with electromagnets, the viscosity of the fluid, and hence the critical frequency of the damper, can be varied depending on driver preference or the weight being carried by the vehicle - or it may be dynamically varied in order to provide stability control across vastly different road conditions. This is in effect a magnetorheological damper. For example, the MagneRide active suspension system permits the damping factor to be adjusted once every millisecond in response to conditions. General Motors (in a partnership with Delphi Corporation) has developed this technology for automotive applications. It made its debut in both Cadillac (Seville STS build date on or after 1/15/2002 with RPO F55) as &quot;Magneride&quot; (or &quot;MR&quot;) and Chevrolet passenger vehicles (All Corvettes made since 2003 with the F55 option code) as part of the driver selectable &quot;Magnetic Selective Ride Control (MSRC)&quot; system in model year 2003. Other manufacturers have paid for the use of it in their own vehicles, for example Audi and Ferrari offer the MagneRide on various models.

General Motors and other automotive companies are seeking to develop a magnetorheological fluid based clutch system for push-button four wheel drive systems. This clutch system would use electromagnets to solidify the fluid which would lock the driveshaft into the drive train.

Porsche has introduced magnetorheological engine mounts in the 2010 Porsche GT3 and GT2. At high engine revolutions, the magnetorheological engine mounts get stiffer to provide a more precise gearbox shifter feel by reducing the relative motion between the power train and chassis/body.

As of September 2007, Acura (Honda) has begun an advertising campaign highlighting its use of MR technology in passenger vehicles manufactured for the 2007 MDX model year.

===Aerospace===
Magnetorheological dampers are under development for use in military and commercial helicopter cockpit seats, as safety devices in the event of a crash. They would be used to decrease the shock delivered to a passenger&#x27;s spinal column, thereby decreasing the rate of permanent injury during a crash.

===Human prosthesis===
Magnetorheological dampers are utilized in semi-active human prosthetic legs. Much like those used in military and commercial helicopters, a damper in the prosthetic leg decreases the shock delivered to the patients leg when jumping, for example. This results in an increased mobility and agility for the patient.

=== Haptic feedback input devices ===
The company XeelTech and CK Materials Lab in Korea use magnetorheological fluid to generate the haptic feedback of their HAPTICORE rotary switches. The MR actuators are primarily used as input devices with adaptive haptic feedback to enable new possibilities in user interface design. The HAPTICORE technology functions like a miniature MR brake. By changing the magnetic field created by a small electromagnet inside the rotary knob, the friction between the outer shell and the stator is modified in such a way that the user perceives the braking effect as haptic feedback.

By modifying the rheological state of the fluid in near real time, a variety of mechanical rotary knob and cam switch haptic patterns such as ticks, grids, and barriers or limits can be simulated. In addition, it is also possible to generate new forms of haptic feedback, such as speed-adaptive and direction-dependent haptic feedback modes. This technology is used, for example, in HMIs of industrial equipment, household appliances or computer peripherals.

<text>Claude Wagner (April 4, 1925 – July 11, 1979) was a Canadian judge and politician in the province of Quebec, Canada. Throughout his career, he was a Crown prosecutor, professor of criminal law and judge.

==Life and career==
Wagner was born in Shawinigan, Quebec, as the son of Corona ( Saint-Arnaud) and Benjamin Wagner. His father, a violinist, was a immigrant from the city of Sucheva in the region of Bukovina, Romania. His mother was French-Canadian.

In 1963, Wagner was appointed as a Sessions Court judge. Subsequently, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in a by-election in Montréal-Verdun on October 5, 1964, and was re-elected in the 1966 general election in Verdun. He earned a &quot;law-and-order&quot; reputation when he served successively as Solicitor General, Attorney General, and Minister of Justice from its creation in 1965 to 1966 in the government of Quebec Premier Jean Lesage.

After losing the 1970 Quebec Liberal Party leadership election to Robert Bourassa, Wagner left electoral politics to return to the bench, receiving appointment once more as a Sessions Court judge. He then entered federal politics, and was elected as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Saint-Hyacinthe in the 1972 federal election, serving in the 29th Parliament as an Opposition MP. He was re-elected in the 1974 election, and after Robert Stanfield resigned as leader of the party, he stood as a candidate at the Progressive Conservative leadership convention of 1976.

Wagner attracted support from Tories who believed that having a leader from Quebec would enable the party to break the federal Liberal Party&#x27;s stranglehold on the province and from right-wing Tories attracted by his law-and-order reputation. He was hurt by revelations of a slush fund that was funded by supporters so that he would be financially solvent if he lost in 1972. Wagner led on the first three ballots of the convention, but Joe Clark won the leadership by 65 votes out of 2,309 on the fourth ballot.

In 1978, he was nominated to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau; he accepted the appointment and sat as a Progressive Conservative. One reason for his departure from the House of Commons was that he could not get along well with Clark. He died of cancer the next year at the age of 54, during Clark&#x27;s brief premiership.

His son, Richard, also pursued a career in the judiciary, eventually being nominated to sit on the Supreme Court of Canada in 2012 by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and who became Chief Justice of Canada in 2017 during the government of Justin Trudeau. On January 21, 2021, Richard Wagner assumed the role of Administrator of Canada, following a workplace review of Rideau Hall and the resignation of Julie Payette as Governor General of Canada, pending the appointment of a new Governor General.

<text>Ferrofluid is a liquid that is attracted to the poles of a magnet. It is a colloidal liquid made of nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles suspended in a fluid (usually an organic solvent or water). Each magnetic particle is thoroughly coated with a surfactant to inhibit clumping. Large ferromagnetic particles can be ripped out of the homogeneous colloidal mixture, forming a separate clump of magnetic dust when exposed to strong magnetic fields. The magnetic attraction of tiny nanoparticles is weak enough that the surfactant&#x27;s Van der Waals force is sufficient to prevent magnetic clumping or agglomeration. Ferrofluids usually do not retain magnetization in the absence of an externally applied field and thus are often classified as &quot;superparamagnets&quot; rather than ferromagnets.

In contrast to ferrofluids, magnetorheological fluids (MR fluids) are magnetic fluids with larger particles. That is, a ferrofluid contains primarily nanoparticles, while an MR fluid contains primarily micrometre-scale particles. The particles in a ferrofluid are suspended by Brownian motion and generally will not settle under normal conditions, while particles in an MR fluid are too heavy to be suspended by Brownian motion. Particles in an MR fluid will therefore settle over time because of the inherent density difference between the particles and their carrier fluid. As a result, ferrofluids and MR fluids have very different applications.

A process for making a ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA&#x27;s Steve Papell to create liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a fuel pump in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field. The name ferrofluid was introduced, the process improved, more highly magnetic liquids synthesized, additional carrier liquids discovered, and the physical chemistry elucidated by R.E. Rosensweig and colleagues. In addition Rosensweig evolved a new branch of fluid mechanics termed ferrohydrodynamics which sparked further theoretical research on intriguing physical phenomena in ferrofluids. In 2019, researchers at the University of Massachusetts and Beijing University of Chemical Technology succeeded in creating a permanently magnetic ferrofluid which retains its magnetism when the external magnetic field is removed. The researchers also found that the droplet&#x27;s magnetic properties were preserved even if the shape was physically changed or it was divided.

==Description==

Ferrofluids are composed of very small nanoscale particles (diameter usually 10 nanometers or less) of magnetite, hematite or some other compound containing iron, and a liquid (usually oil). This is small enough for thermal agitation to disperse them evenly within a carrier fluid, and for them to contribute to the overall magnetic response of the fluid. This is similar to the way that the ions in an aqueous paramagnetic salt solution (such as an aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate or manganese(II) chloride) make the solution paramagnetic. The composition of a typical ferrofluid is about 5% magnetic solids, 10% surfactant and 85% carrier, by volume.

Particles in ferrofluids are dispersed in a liquid, often using a surfactant, and thus ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions – materials with properties of more than one state of matter. In this case, the two states of matter are the solid metal and liquid it is in. This ability to change phases with the application of a magnetic field allows them to be used as seals, lubricants, and may open up further applications in future nanoelectromechanical systems.

True ferrofluids are stable. This means that the solid particles do not agglomerate or phase separate even in extremely strong magnetic fields. However, the surfactant tends to break down over time (a few years), and eventually the nano-particles will agglomerate, and they will separate out and no longer contribute to the fluid&#x27;s magnetic response.

The term magnetorheological fluid (MRF) refers to liquids similar to ferrofluids (FF) that solidify in the presence of a magnetic field. Magnetorheological fluids have micrometre scale magnetic particles that are one to three orders of magnitude larger than those of ferrofluids.

However, ferrofluids lose their magnetic properties at sufficiently high temperatures, known as the Curie temperature.

===Normal-field instability===
When a paramagnetic fluid is subjected to a strong vertical magnetic field, the surface forms a regular pattern of peaks and valleys. This effect is known as the &quot;Rosensweig&quot; or &quot;normal-field instability&quot;. The instability is driven by the magnetic field; it can be explained by considering which shape of the fluid minimizes the total energy of the system.

From the point of view of magnetic energy, peaks and valleys are energetically favorable. In the corrugated configuration, the magnetic field is concentrated in the peaks; since the fluid is more easily magnetized than the air, this lowers the magnetic energy. In consequence the spikes of fluid ride the field lines out into space until there is a balance of the forces involved.

At the same time the formation of peaks and valleys is resisted by gravity and surface tension. It requires energy both to move fluid out of the valleys and up into the spikes, and to increase the surface area of the fluid. In summary, the formation of the corrugations increases the surface free energy and the gravitational energy of the liquid, but reduces the magnetic energy. The corrugations will only form above a critical magnetic field strength, when the reduction in magnetic energy outweighs the increase in surface and gravitation energy terms.
Ferrofluids have an exceptionally high magnetic susceptibility and the critical magnetic field for the onset of the corrugations can be realised by a small bar magnet.

===Common ferrofluid surfactants===
The soapy surfactants used to coat the nanoparticles include, but are not limited to:

* oleic acid
* tetramethylammonium hydroxide
* citric acid
* soy lecithin

These surfactants prevent the nanoparticles from clumping together, so the particles can not fall out of suspension nor clump into a pile of magnetic dust on near the magnet. The magnetic particles in an ideal ferrofluid never settle out, even when exposed to a strong magnetic field. A surfactant has a polar head and non-polar tail (or vice versa), one of which adsorbs to a nanoparticle, while the non-polar tail (or polar head) sticks out into the carrier medium, forming an inverse or regular micelle, respectively, around the particle. Electrostatic repulsion then prevents agglomeration of the particles.

While surfactants are useful in prolonging the settling rate in ferrofluids, they also hinder the fluid&#x27;s magnetic properties (specifically, the fluid&#x27;s magnetic saturation). The addition of surfactants (or any other foreign particles) decreases the packing density of the ferroparticles while in its activated state, thus decreasing the fluid&#x27;s on-state viscosity, resulting in a &quot;softer&quot; activated fluid. While the on-state viscosity (the &quot;hardness&quot; of the activated fluid) is less of a concern for some ferrofluid applications, it is a primary fluid property for the majority of their commercial and industrial applications and therefore a compromise must be met when considering on-state viscosity versus the settling rate of a ferrofluid.

==Applications==
===Current===
====Electronic devices====

Ferrofluids are used to form liquid seals around the spinning drive shafts in hard disks. The rotating shaft is surrounded by magnets. A small amount of ferrofluid, placed in the gap between the magnet and the shaft, will be held in place by its attraction
to the magnet. The fluid of magnetic particles forms a barrier which prevents debris from entering the interior of the hard drive. According to engineers at Ferrotec, ferrofluid seals on rotating shafts typically withstand 3 to 4 psi; additional seals can be stacked to form assemblies capable of withstanding higher pressures.

====Mechanical engineering====
Ferrofluids have friction-reducing capabilities. If applied to the surface of a strong enough magnet, such as one made of neodymium, it can cause the magnet to glide across smooth surfaces with minimal resistance.

==== Materials science research ====
Ferrofluids can be used to image magnetic domain structures on the surface of ferromagnetic materials using a technique developed by Francis Bitter.

====Loudspeakers====
Starting in 1973, ferrofluids have been used in loudspeakers to remove heat from the voice coil, and to passively damp the movement of the cone. They reside in what would normally be the air gap around the voice coil, held in place by the speaker&#x27;s magnet. Since ferrofluids are paramagnetic, they obey Curie&#x27;s law and thus become less magnetic at higher temperatures. A strong magnet placed near the voice coil (which produces heat) will attract cold ferrofluid more than hot ferrofluid thus pushing the heated ferrofluid away from the electric voice coil and toward a heat sink. This is a relatively efficient cooling method which requires no additional energy input.

Bob Berkowitz of Acoustic Research began studying ferrofluid in 1972, using it to damp resonance of a tweeter. Dana Hathaway of Epicure in Massachusetts was using ferrofluid for tweeter damping in 1974, and he noticed the cooling mechanism. Fred Becker and Lou Melillo of Becker Electronics were also early adopters in 1976, with Melillo joining Ferrofluidics and publishing a paper in 1980. In concert sound, Showco began using ferrofluid in 1979 for cooling woofers. Panasonic was the first Asian manufacturer to put ferrofluid in commercial loudspeakers, in 1979. The field grew rapidly in the early 1980s. Today, some 300 million sound-generating transducers per year are produced with ferrofluid inside, including speakers installed in laptops, cell phones, headphones and earbuds.

====Cell separations====
Ferrofluids conjugated with antibodies or common capture agents such as Streptavidin (SA) or rat anti-mouse Ig (RAM) are used in immunomagnetic separation, a subset of cell sorting. These conjugated ferrofluids are used to bind to target cells, and then magnetically separate them from a cell mixture using a low-gradient magnetic separator. These ferrofluids have applications such as cell therapy, gene therapy, cellular manufacturing, among others.

====Audio-visualization====
On the aesthetic side, ferrofluids can be displayed to visualize sound. For that purpose, the blob of ferrofluid is suspended in a clear liquid. An electromagnet acts on the shape of the ferrofluid in response to the volume or the audio frequency of the music, allowing it to selectively react to a song’s treble or bass.

====Ferrolens====
A magneto-optic device and magnetic-field flux viewer dynamic lens can be created by using a superparamagnetic thin-film encapsulated and sealed between two optic flat glasses. The thin film is made of a heavily diluted, almost transparent ferrofluid that is several microns thick. The ferrolens has an LED ring array around its perimeter that illuminates it. When an external magnetic field is projected onto the surface of the thin film, it produces a 2D flux magnetic field imprint pattern, similar to the Faraday&#x27;s classical iron filings experiment. This pattern includes depth of field information of the external field being displayed by the ferrolens device, despite the thin film having a finite thickness only of several microns (i.e. 10 to 20 μm).

===Former===
====Medical applications====
Several ferrofluids were marketed for use as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, which depend on the difference in magnetic relaxation times of different tissues to provide contrast. Several agents were introduced and then withdrawn from the market, including Feridex I.V. (also known as Endorem and ferumoxides), discontinued in 2008; resovist (also known as Cliavist), 2001 to 2009; Sinerem (also known as Combidex), withdrawn in 2007; Lumirem (also known as Gastromark), 1996 to 2012; Clariscan (also known as PEG-fero, Feruglose, and NC100150), development of which was discontinued due to safety concerns.

===Future===
====Spacecraft propulsion====

Ferrofluids can be made to self-assemble nanometer-scale needle-like sharp tips under the influence of a magnetic field. When they reach a critical thinness, the needles begin emitting jets that might be used in the future as a thruster mechanism to propel small satellites such as CubeSats.

====Analytical instrumentation====
Ferrofluids have numerous optical applications because of their refractive properties; that is, each grain, a micromagnet, reflects light. These applications include measuring specific viscosity of a liquid placed between a polarizer and an analyzer, illuminated by a helium–neon laser.

====Medical applications====
Ferrofluids have been proposed for magnetic drug targeting. In this process the drugs would be attached to or enclosed within a ferrofluid and could be targeted and selectively released using magnetic fields.

It has also been proposed for targeted magnetic hyperthermia to convert electromagnetic energy into heat.

It has also been proposed in a form of nanosurgery to separate one tissue from another—for example a tumor from the tissue in which it has grown.

====Heat transfer====
An external magnetic field imposed on a ferrofluid with varying susceptibility (e.g., because of a temperature gradient) results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to a form of heat transfer called thermomagnetic convection. This form of heat transfer can be useful when conventional convection heat transfer is inadequate; e.g., in miniature microscale devices or under reduced gravity conditions.

Ferrofluids of suitable composition can exhibit extremely large enhancement in thermal conductivity (k; ~300% of the base fluid thermal conductivity). The large enhancement in k is due to the efficient transport of heat through percolating nanoparticle paths. Special magnetic nanofluids with tunable thermal conductivity to viscosity ratio can be used as multifunctional ‘smart materials’ that can remove heat and also arrest vibrations (damper). Such fluids may find applications in microfluidic devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

====Optics====
Research is under way to create an adaptive optics shape-shifting magnetic mirror from ferrofluid for Earth-based astronomical telescopes.

Optical filters are used to select different wavelengths of light. The replacement of filters is cumbersome, especially when the wavelength is changed continuously with tunable-type lasers. Optical filters tunable for different wavelengths by varying the magnetic field can be built using ferrofluid emulsion.

====Energy harvesting====
Ferrofluids enable the harvesting of vibration energy from the environment. Existing methods of harvesting low frequency (&lt;100 Hz) vibrations require the use of solid resonant structures. With ferrofluids, energy harvester designs no longer need solid structure. One example of ferrofluid based energy harvesting is to place the ferrofluid inside a container to use external mechanical vibrations to generate electricity inside a coil wrapped around the container surrounded by a permanent magnet. First a ferrofluid is placed inside a container that is wrapped with a coil of wire. The ferrofluid is then externally magnetized using a permanent magnet. When external vibrations cause the ferrofluid to slosh around in the container, there is a change in magnetic flux fields with respect to the coil of wire. Through Faraday&#x27;s law of electromagnetic induction, voltage is induced in the coil of wire due to change in magnetic flux.

<text>Ivan Rebroff (born Hans Rolf Rippert; 31 July 193127 February 2008) was a German vocalist, allegedly of Russian ancestry, who rose to prominence for his distinct and extensive vocal range of four octaves, ranging &quot;from a low F to a high F, one and a quarter octaves above C&quot;. An imposing figure on stage, usually bearded and dressed in Cossack clothing, his presence was enhanced by his height, being over 2 metres tall.

==Life and career==

Rebroff was born on 31 July 1931 in Berlin (prematurely, he asserted, at seven months, on a train platform) as Hans Rolf Rippert to German parents. His parents were Paul Rippert, an engineer born in 1897 in Liebenwerda, and Luise Fenske, born in Bydgoszcz (then part of Prussian Bromberg). He claimed Russian descent, and while often disputed, this has never been totally refuted. In a 1989 interview with &quot;Izvestia&quot;, he said &quot;according to documents I am Ivan Pavlovich Rebroff&quot; ().

He studied singing at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. Although his knowledge and pronunciation of Russian was imperfect, he became famous for singing Russian folk songs, but also performed opera, light classics and folk songs from many other countries. He was known on stage for his gusto. He performed over 6,000 concerts in his career, including a two-year seven-day-a-week stint at the Théâtre Marigny in Paris, singing and acting, among other greats, the role of Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. When he was well into his seventies, Rebroff still performed 13 concerts in 21 days on an Australian tour.

Rebroff described himself as international, the &quot;connection between East and West&quot;. He was named an honorary citizen of the Greek Sporades island of Skopelos, his domicile. Rebroff was homosexual.

He died in Frankfurt on 27 February 2008, after a long illness. Four days after his death, his brother , who is nine years his senior (and by his own unsubstantiated accounts shot down Antoine de Saint-Exupéry during World War II), claimed part of Rebroff&#x27;s vast fortune.

<doc id="533803" wikidata="Q7728849" url="?curid=533803" title="The Dandy Annual">
<text>The Dandy Annual is the name of a book that has been published every year since 1938, to tie in with the children&#x27;s comic &quot;The Dandy&quot;. there have been 86 editions. The Dandy Annual still continues to be published, even though the weekly comic ended in 2013. The annuals are traditionally published in July or August, in time for Christmas, and since 1965 they have had the date of the following year on the cover. Before then no date was given.

From 1938 to 1951 the annual was called The Dandy Monster Comic. The name changed to The Dandy Book in 1952 and continued, the year changing for each subsequent annual, until the release of the 2003 book in 2002 when it was renamed &quot;The Dandy Annual&quot;. Despite the comic&#x27;s relaunch as Dandy Xtreme in 2007, the annual was still known as &quot;The Dandy Annual&quot;. This is likely because the annuals of the time were mostly made up of &quot;Dandy Comix&quot;, due to the topical nature of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Xtreme&quot; content.

In unison with the comic at the time, the front cover usually featured Korky the Cat. After Desperate Dan took over the front page in 1984, the annual cover reflected this by featuring both Korky and Dan until the release of the 1991 book in 1990 – which was the first ever Dandy Annual to not feature Korky on the front cover in any way. He has made several appearances since then, despite the main focus shifting to Dan.

In 2006, the original 1939 Monster Comic was reprinted as a facsimile edition in a collector&#x27;s slipcase.

==List of annuals==

<doc id="533805" wikidata="Q3587152" url="?curid=533805" title="2001 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji in August and September 2001. The Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua party won 18 of the 23 seats reserved for ethnic Fijians and one of three &quot;general electorates&quot; set aside for Fiji&#x27;s European, Chinese, and other minorities. It also won 13 of the 25 &quot;open electorates,&quot; so-called because they are open to candidates of any race and are elected by universal suffrage. The remaining five ethnic Fijian seats, and one open electorate, were won by the Conservative Alliance, one of whom was George Speight who had led the putsch against the lawful government the year before. Chaudhry&#x27;s Labour Party won all 19 Indo-Fijian seats and eight open electorates. The New Labour Unity Party, formed by defectors from the FLP, won one general electorate and one open electorate. The three remaining seats (one general electorate, one open electorate, and the Rotuman Islanders&#x27; seat) were won by minor parties and independent candidates.

==Background==
The Constitution of Fiji was restored by a High Court decision on 15 November 2000, following the failure of the political upheaval in which the government had been deposed and the constitution suspended in May that year. On 1 March 2001, the Appeal Court upheld the decision. An election to restore democracy was held in September 2001. In what was one of Fiji&#x27;s most bitterly fought elections ever, the newly formed Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua of the interim Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase narrowly defeated the Fiji Labour Party of deposed former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.

The FLP had been hurt by leadership bickering in the wake of the coup, and the subsequent defection of a number of its high-profile members from the ethnic Fijian community, including Tupeni Baba, the former Deputy Prime Minister. The mutual refusal of the FLP and the National Federation Party, the only other political party with significant Indo-Fijian support, to reach a preference-swapping deal had also worked against both parties. (In Fiji&#x27;s system of transferable voting, any two or more candidates in a particular constituency can have their votes combined, unless the electors specify a different option by ranking the candidates numerically in order of their preference).

===Seats changing hands===
This does not include seats that changed candidates but not parties, defections or seats held by members not seeking re-election.

==Aftermath==
Controversy continued after the 2001 election, with Prime Minister Qarase finding reasons, which many considered to be pretexts, for not implementing the power-sharing provisions of the Constitution, which required that every political party with more than 8 seats in the House of Representatives must be proportionally represented in the Cabinet. On 18 July 2003, the Supreme Court of Fiji ruled that Qarase&#x27;s exclusion of the Labour Party from the Cabinet was unconstitutional, and demanded that the situation be rectified. Appeals, counter-appeals, and negotiations delayed the implementation of the order. In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the Labour Party was entitled to 14 out of 30 Cabinet posts. Qarase has said that he would abide by the ruling, but his refusal to include Chaudhry in the Cabinet lineup continued to stall negotiations, until the FLP announced in November that it was no longer interested in participating in the Qarase-led government.

<doc id="533810" wikidata="Q260627" url="?curid=533810" title="List of cities in Kansas">
<text>Kansas is a state located in the Midwestern United States. According to the 2023 United States Census estimate its population is 2,940,546 and Kansas has a growth rate of 0.09% annually, which ranks 31st among all 50 states. Kansas is the 13th largest by land area spanning of land. Kansas is divided into 105 counties and contains 627 municipalities consisting of cities.

==City requirements==
All incorporated communities in Kansas are called cities, unlike in some states where some are called towns or villages. (11 of 50 states only have cities).

Once a city is incorporated in Kansas, it will continue to be a city even after falling below the minimum required to become a city, and even if the minimum is later raised. A city can de-incorporate, but if citizens decide to re-incorporate at a later date, then new minimum requirements must be met.

By State law, cities in Kansas are divided into three classes.

* Cities of the 3rd Class - When a city incorporates, it becomes a city of the 3rd class. To incorporate, a city must generally have either 300 inhabitants or 300 or more platted lots served by water and sewer lines. This minimum requirement has increased since older historical minimum requirements.
* Cities of the 2nd Class - A city may petition to become a city of the 2nd class when its population is more than 2,000 but less than 15,000. A city whose population is between 2,000 and 15,000 may elect to remain a city of the 3rd class, but must become a city of the 2nd class when it reaches 15,000 population.
* Cities of the 1st Class - A city may petition to become a city of the 1st class when its population reaches 15,000. A city whose population is between 15,000 and 25,000 may elect to remain a city of the 2nd class but must become a city of the 1st class when it reaches 25,000 population.

==Highest population listing==
Population data based on 2020 census and 2023 estimate with over 4,000 people. The city of Topeka, in addition to being the county seat for Shawnee County, is the state capital.

 

===Military installations===

:&quot;See Kansas forts and posts for a historical list&quot;
As a supplement to the list of cities, the following military installations are provided because of their relative size in active duty and/or service members living on the post and their location within the borders of the state of Kansas. The table values for &quot;Population in Quarters&quot; includes reported totals of active duty, family, civilians, reservists, and retired personnel living on the installation.

As of 2016, over 85,000 people live on military installations in Kansas—including over 25,000 active duty personnel. Although not considered &quot;cities&quot;, these military installations certainly should be considered as population centers of note.

<text>Burnham Thorpe is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is famous for being the birthplace of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, victor at the Battle of Trafalgar and one of Britain&#x27;s greatest heroes. At the time of his birth, Nelson&#x27;s father, Edmund Nelson, was rector of the church in Burnham Thorpe.

Burnham Thorpe is located north-east of King&#x27;s Lynn and north-west of Norwich.

== History ==
Burnham Thorpe&#x27;s name is of combined Anglo-Saxon and Viking origin, and derives from the Old English for a settlement along the River Burn with the Old Norse for an outlying farmstead.

In the Domesday Book, Burnham Thorpe is listed as a settlement of 58 households in the hundred of Gallow. In 1086, the village was divided between the estates of William de Warenne and Robert de Verly.

In 1758, Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson KB, 1st Viscount Nelson was born in the Rectory in Burnham Thorpe. Nelson served a distinguished career in the Royal Navy, leading his men to victories at the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Trafalgar among others. Nelson is proudly remembered in the village, with multiple monuments erected in his honour. The Rectory where Nelson was born has since been demolished, with its site being marked by a roadside plaque.

The village&#x27;s main public house was built in 1637 and was known as &quot;The Plough&quot; until 1798 when it was renamed &quot;The Lord Nelson&quot; in honour of the victory at the Battle of the Nile. Nelson held a dinner here for the men of the village prior to his departure to join . The pub survives to this day and is operated by Woodforde&#x27;s Brewery.

Other listed buildings in Burnham Thorpe include Manor House (Seventeenth Century with Medieval stone), Ivy Farm Barn (Sixteenth Century), School House (Seventeenth Century) and East End Farm House (Seventeenth Century).

Burnhamthorpe Road in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada was named after Burnham Thorpe, the homeplace of settler, John Abelson.

== Geography ==
According to the 2021 census, the population of Burnham Thorpe is 131 people which shows a slight decrease from the 144 people listed in the 2011 census.

The B1355, between Fakenham and Burnham Norton, runs through the parish as does the course of the River Burn.

==All Saints&#x27; Church==
Burnham Thorpe&#x27;s parish church is located along Church Lane where a church has stood since the Domesday Book of 1087. The present building has an arcade dating from the 13th-century, aisles from the 14th-century and the clerestorey, north porch and chancel date from the 15th-century. A bell tower of three stages at the west end also dates from the 15th-century, due to these features the church is a Grade I listed building.

Additionally, the church boasts several memorials to both Horatio Nelson and to his father, Edmund Nelson and a large stone font, in which the former was baptised.

<doc id="533816" wikidata="Q1107036" url="?curid=533816" title="List of cities in Kentucky">
<text>Kentucky, a state in the United States, has 418 active cities.

The two most populous cities, Louisville and Lexington, are designated &quot;first class&quot; cities. A first class city would normally have a mayor-alderman government, but that does not apply to the merged governments in Louisville and Lexington. All other cities have a different form of government, including mayor-council, commission, and city manager, and are designated &quot;home rule class&quot; cities.

==Classes==
The two-class system went into effect on January 1, 2015, following the 2014 passage of House Bill 331 by the Kentucky General Assembly and the bill&#x27;s signing into law by Governor Steve Beshear.

The new system replaced one in which cities were divided into six classes based on their population at the time of their classification. Before the enactment of House Bill 331, more than 400 classification-related laws affected public safety, alcohol beverage control, revenue options and others. Lexington and Fayette County are completely merged in a unitary urban county government (UCG); Louisville and other cities within Jefferson County have also merged into a single metro government. However, under state law, both major cities retained their pre-merger classification before the new scheme took effect. The General Assembly had historically reclassified cities only when requested by the city government. If all cities had been reclassified in the pre-2015 scheme according to actual population, about one-third of classifications would have changed. In particular, Lexington would have been classified as a first-class (Class 1) city.

Although basic city classification changed in 2015, the old classifications will remain relevant for some time. Because many provisions of state law applied only to cities of certain pre-2015 classes, House Bill 331 was explicitly written to address such issues. In certain areas of law, class-based distinctions between cities have been replaced by population-based distinctions. In certain other areas that were more controversial, the pre-2015 status quo is being maintained through a registry of cities that were covered by prior laws.

Under the new system, Louisville and Lexington are classified as first class. All other cities in the state are in the home rule class.

<doc id="533847" wikidata="Q140017" url="?curid=533847" title="Mercedes McCambridge">
<text>Carlotta Mercedes Agnes McCambridge (March 16, 1916 – March 2, 2004) was an American actress of radio, stage, film, and television. Orson Welles called her &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest living radio actress&quot;. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her screen debut in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949) and was nominated in the same category for &quot;Giant&quot; (1956). She voiced the majority of dialogue for demon Pazuzu in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973).

==Early life==
McCambridge was born in Joliet, Illinois, the daughter of Irish-American Catholic parents Marie (née Mahaffry) and John Patrick McCambridge, a farmer. She graduated from Mundelein College in Chicago.

==Career==
===Radio===
McCambridge began her career as a radio actor during the 1930s while also performing on Broadway. In 1941, she played Judy&#x27;s friend in &quot;A Date with Judy&quot;. She had the title role in &quot;Defense Attorney&quot;, a crime drama broadcast on ABC in 1951–52. Her other work on radio included:
* episodes of &quot;Lights Out&quot; (including &quot;It Happened&quot;, 5/11/1938; &quot;Execution&quot;, 4/27/1943 and &quot;The Word&quot;, 9/14/1943)
* episodes of &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; (including &quot;Blood of Cain&quot;, 1/29/1946, &quot;Death&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot;, 11/4/1946, &quot;But the Dead Walk Alone&quot; (December 2, 1946). and &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;, 10/27/1947)
* episodes of the &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; radio series
* episodes of &quot;Gang Busters&quot;
* episodes of &quot;Murder at Midnight&quot; (including &quot;The Man with the Black Beard&quot;, 5/8/1950)
* episodes of &quot;Studio One&quot; (including &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;, 10/14/1947; &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot;, 11/4/1947 and &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;, 3/28/1948)
* Episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents as Dr. Constance Peterson in Spellbound
* episodes of &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; (including &quot;Spellbound&quot;, 1/25/1951 and &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;, 7/5/1951)
* episodes of &quot;Ford Theater&quot; (including &quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot;, 3/4/1949)
* Rosemary Levy on &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot;
* Peggy King Martinson on &quot;This Is Nora Drake&quot; (1948)
* various characters on the radio series &quot;I Love A Mystery&quot; in both its West Coast and East Coast incarnations (including The Stewardess and Charity Martin in &quot;The Thing That Cries in the Night&quot;, Nasha and Laura in &quot;Bury Your Dead, Arizona&quot;, Sunny Richards in both &quot;The Million Dollar Curse&quot; and &quot;The Temple of Vampires&quot; and Jack &quot;Jacqueline&quot; Dempsey Ross in &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot;)

She frequently performed feature roles on the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;, and was an original cast member on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (before the Bauers took over as the central characters). She also starred in her own show, &quot;Defense Attorney&quot; on ABC 1951–52, as Martha Ellis Bryan.

From June 22, 1953, to March 5, 1954, McCambridge starred in the soap opera &quot;Family Skeleton&quot; on CBS.

===Television===
McCambridge played Katherine Wells in &quot;Wire Service&quot;, a drama series that aired on ABC during 1956–57, produced by Desilu Productions.
The series starred McCambridge, George Brent, and Dane Clark as reporters for the fictional Trans Globe Wire Service.

In the season one episode of the original &quot;Lost in Space&quot; series &quot;The Space Croppers&quot;, aired on CBS in March 1966, McCambridge played Sybilla, the matriarch of a family of supernatural space farmers.

In an episode of &quot;Bewitched&quot; titled &quot;Darrin Gone! and Forgotten,&quot; which aired on ABC in October 1968, McCambridge played a powerful witch named Carlotta (McCambridge&#x27;s real first name), a frenemy of Endora. Endora and Carlotta had made a pact &quot;at the turn of the century&quot; that their first-born children would one day marry. When, according to the pact terms, certain celestial phenomena signaled it was time for the marriage, Carlotta (McCambridge) disappeared Darrin and pushed for Samantha to marry her coddled son Juke (played by veteran character actor Steve Franken).

===Film===
McCambridge&#x27;s film career took off when she was cast as Sadie Burke opposite Broderick Crawford in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949). McCambridge won the 1949 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the role, while the film won Best Picture for that year. McCambridge also won the Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress and New Star of the Year – Actress for her performance.

In 1954, she co-starred with Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden in the offbeat western drama, &quot;Johnny Guitar,&quot; now regarded as a cult classic. McCambridge and Hayden publicly declared their dislike of Crawford, with McCambridge labeling her &quot;a mean, tipsy, powerful, rotten-egg lady.&quot;

McCambridge played the supporting role of Luz in the George Stevens classic &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), which starred Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean. She was nominated for another Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress but lost to Dorothy Malone in &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;. In 1959, McCambridge appeared opposite Katharine Hepburn, Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor in the Joseph L. Mankiewicz film adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot;.

McCambridge appeared as a leather jacket-wearing hoodlum in &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, reuniting with her former radio colleague Orson Welles for the 1958 film.

McCambridge provided the dubbed voice of Pazuzu, the demon possessing the young girl Regan (played by Linda Blair) in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. To sound as disturbing as possible, McCambridge insisted on swallowing raw eggs, chain smoking and drinking whiskey to make her voice harsh and her performance aggressive. Director William Friedkin also arranged for her to be bound to a chair during recordings, so that the demon seemed to be struggling against its restraints. Friedkin claimed that she initially requested no credit for the film—fearing it would take away from the attention of Blair&#x27;s performance—but later complained about her absence of credit during the film&#x27;s premiere. Her dispute with Friedkin and the Warner Bros. over her exclusion ended when, with the help of the Screen Actors Guild, she was properly credited for her vocal work in the film.

In the 1970s, she toured in a road company production of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; as Big Mama, opposite John Carradine as Big Daddy.

McCambridge appeared as a guest artist in college productions. In May 1977, she helped dedicate the theater building of El Centro College by starring in a production of &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. Director Eddie Thomas had known her for many years and she conducted an actors&#x27; workshop for the college students during the week prior to the opening night. She returned in 1979 for El Centre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, in which she received top billing despite her character being murdered (by actor Jim Beaver) fewer than 15 minutes into the play. She also starred with longtime character actor Lyle Talbot (of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;) in the 1970 production of &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; in the University of North Alabama Summer Theatre Productions.

In the mid-1970s, McCambridge briefly took a position as director of Livengrin, a Pennsylvania rehabilitation center for alcoholics. She was at the same time putting the finishing touches on her soon-to-be released autobiography, &quot;The Quality of Mercy: An Autobiography&quot; (Times Books, 1981), .

==Personal life==
McCambridge married her first husband, William Fifield, a writer, in 1939. They had a son, John Lawrence Fifield, born in December 1941. The couple divorced in 1946 after seven years of marriage.

In 1950 McCambridge married Canadian Fletcher Markle, an actor/producer/director who directed her in productions on &quot;Ford Theater&quot; and &quot;Studio One&quot;. Her son, John, later took Markle&#x27;s name, thereafter being known as John Markle. During the marriage and afterward, McCambridge battled alcoholism, often being hospitalized after episodes of heavy drinking. She and Markle divorced in 1962, after twelve years of marriage. In 1969, after years with Alcoholics Anonymous, she achieved sobriety.

From 1975 to 1982, McCambridge devoted her time to the nonprofit Livengrin Foundation of Bensalem, Pennsylvania. She first served as a volunteer member of the Board of Directors, then as president and CEO, responsible for the day-to-day operations of the treatment center, which at the time was a 76-bed residential program for both male and female alcoholics. Livengrin still operates today, and has 129 beds and 8 outpatient clinics throughout southeastern Pennsylvania, treating both alcoholism and drug addiction. McCambridge, through her celebrity and larger-than-life personality, helped bring public recognition to, and acceptance of the disease of addiction, as well as the benefits of seeking treatment for the disease. She freely shared her own story of addiction and recovery as a means of reaching others in need of help.

She was a staunch outspoken liberal Democrat who campaigned for Adlai Stevenson.

Despite never even personally coming out as either homosexual or bisexual, The Advocate stated that McCambridge &quot;played the most fiercely dykey roles on-screen to perfection.&quot;

McCambridge died on March 2, 2004, at age 87 in La Jolla in San Diego, California, of natural causes.

===Family tragedy===
McCambridge&#x27;s son John Markle, a UCLA graduate with a Ph.D. in Economics, joined the Little Rock, Arkansas, investment firm Stephens Inc. in 1979, after working for Salomon Brothers in New York City. Markle was a successful futures trader, and quickly rose through the company&#x27;s ranks. McCambridge gave Markle $604,000 ($ in ) to manage for her, but in the fall of 1987, the company discovered that Markle had opened a secret account in McCambridge&#x27;s name. Soon the company found that Markle had been charging trading losses to the Stephens house account, while crediting profitable trades to McCambridge&#x27;s account. Markle was later shown to have forged his mother&#x27;s signature in opening the account.

Markle was placed on medical leave, then fired from his position at Stephens. McCambridge refused to cooperate with Markle and the company in instituting a repayment scheme that would have kept the matter from becoming public, saying that she had done nothing wrong and that Stephens Inc. owed her money. Shortly thereafter, in November 1987, Markle killed his family—his wife Christine, 45, and daughters Amy, 13, and Suzanne, 9—and then himself. He left a note taking responsibility for his crimes and a long, bitter letter to his mother. The letter contained the following: &quot;Initially you said, &#x27;well, we can work it out&#x27; but NO, you refused… You called me a liar, a cheat, a criminal, a bum. You said I have ruined your life… You were never around much when I needed you, so now I and my whole family are dead—so you can have the money… &#x27;Night, Mother.&quot;

In 1986, McCambridge had played the mother of a child who plans to take their own life in an Arkansas Repertory Theatre production of &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot;.

==Legacy==
For her contributions to television and the motion picture industry, Mercedes McCambridge has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for motion pictures at 1722 Vine Street, and one for television at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="533850" wikidata="Q2895603" url="?curid=533850" title="Ben Weider">
<text>Benjamin Weider, (1 February 1923 – 17 October 2008) was a Canadian soldier, author, historian (Napoleonic history), fitness proponent, benefactor of the arts, and entrepreneur. He co-founded the International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB) alongside his brother Joe Weider. The Weiders also founded many successful businesses including gyms, nutritional supplements and magazines such as Muscle &amp; Fitness.

He wrote several books about Napoleon, including best seller &quot;The Murder of Napoleon,&quot; translated to 45 languages.

==Family==
Benjamin Weider was born 1 February 1923 in the old Jewish immigrant quarter (&quot;the Main&quot;) of Montréal (Quebec, Canada), the third son of Louis and Anna Weider, Polish Jewish emigrants from the town of Kurów (Poland). Ben left school at 13 to work in restaurants and factories.

==Military service==
In 1942, he enlisted in the Canadian Army, serving in the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars, in which he did intelligence work as a member of the Canadian Intelligence Corps. Ben Weider served in the Canadian Army during World War II.

==Fitness business==
Weider and his brother, started a mimeographed magazine (&quot;Your Fitness&quot;) to promote weightlifting and sell exercise equipment, which expanded into other titles including &quot;Flex&quot;, &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot;, and &quot;Fit Pregnancy&quot;. The magazines were sold in 2003 to American Media.

The brothers are attributed with creating bodybuilding as a sport, where the focus was on the form and fitness of the body shaped by the exercise. In 1965 the brothers formed the first Mr Olympia contest at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (New York City, New York, United States), an alternative to the Mr. Universe competition.

In 1968, the brothers brought Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was then an unknown Austrian bodybuilder, to California.

He co-founded the International Federation of BodyBuilding &amp; Fitness (IFBB) along with brother Joe Weider, and was its president until he announced his retirement on 29 October 2006. He also co-founded (1936) and ran a physical fitness and sporting goods business from Montreal with his brother, which bears their family name.

Ben Weider opened a number of gyms around the world, including in Lebanon.

==Historical research==
Weider was known as an advocate of the theory that Napoleon was assassinated with arsenic poisoning by a member of his entourage during his exile in Saint Helena. Weider had even obtained authenticated Napoleon hair samples and arranged for forensic tests that showed that Napoleon had been poisoned with arsenic. He co-authored several Napoleonic history books including, &quot;Assassination at St. Helena&quot;, &quot;Assassination at St. Helena Revisited&quot; and &quot;The Murder of Napoleon&quot;. &quot;The Murder of Napoleon&quot; became one of the best-selling history books of all time, now with editions in 45 languages.

Weider also founded the International Napoleonic Society, of which he was the president, and wrote numerous articles for this organization.

Weider owned an extensive collection of Napoleon memorabilia. He donated this collection to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, making it one of the largest collections of its kind in the world.

In 2006, the Weider History Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Weider Health and Fitness Inc, acquired &quot;Civil War Times&quot; in an acquisition of eleven history-related magazines from another magazine chain, along with &quot;America&#x27;s Civil War&quot;, &quot;Armchair General&quot;, &quot;Civil War Times&quot;, &quot;Vietnam&quot;, etc. These acquisitions caused controversies over a change in editorial direction, including the resignation of the &quot;Civil War Times&quot;″s editor (Chris Lewis), and general criticisms of anti-Palestine bias.

==Religion==
Weider was a Jewish Anglophone. He financially assisted the rebuilding of Montreal&#x27;s Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral. Jean-Claude Turcotte, the Roman Catholic Cardinal, said of him that Ben Weider was &quot;One of the greatest Montrealers I ever knew&quot;.

==Awards==
Weider was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1975 (subsequently promoted to Officer in 2006), a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 2000, a Knight of the French Legion of Honor on 12 October 2000 (for his research work into Napoleon&#x27;s death), a member of the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame, and a Commander of the Venerable Order of St. John (for his charitable work promoting youth fitness and health worldwide). In 1984, Ben Weider was also nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The &quot;Revolutionary and Napoleonic Studies&quot; program of Florida State University&#x27;s History Department created the &quot;Ben Weider Eminent Scholar Chair in Napoleonic History&quot; and the &quot;Ben Weider Chair of French Revolutionary History&quot;, supported by Weider&#x27;s bequests.

From 1998 to 2005, Weider was Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the 62nd (Shawinigan) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA. In 2005, he was promoted to Honorary Colonel of that military unit.

In 2003, he received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from &quot;Club Industry&#x27;s Fitness Business Pro&quot; in 2003.

In 2008, he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 20th Anniversary Arnold Classic.

In 2014, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame along with Joe and Betty Weider.

==Death==
Weider died on October 17, 2008, at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Bigger&quot; was released in 2018 on the life of Ben Weider and his brother Joe Weider.

<doc id="533851" wikidata="Q5032023" url="?curid=533851" title="Candomblé Bantu">
<text>Candomblé Bantu (also called Candomblé Batuque or Angola) is one of the major branches (&quot;nations&quot;) of the Candomblé religious belief system. It developed in the Portuguese Empire among Kongo and Mbundu slaves who spoke Kikongo and Kimbundu languages. The supreme and creative god is Nzambi or Nzambi a Mpungu. Below him are the Jinkisi or Minkisi, deities of Bantu mythology. These deities resemble Olorun and the other orishas of the Yoruba religion. Minkisi is a Kongo language term: it is the plural of Nkisi, meaning &quot;receptacle&quot;. Akixi comes from the Kimbundu language term Mukixi.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Bantu&quot; means &quot;people&quot;; it is a combination of &quot;ba&quot;, a plural noun marker and &quot;-ntu&quot;, meaning &quot;person&quot;. &quot;Banto&quot; was a generic term used by the Portuguese in Brazil to describe people who spoke Bantu languages.

==Pantheon==

*Nzambi is the &quot;sovereign master&quot;; he created the earth, then withdrew from the world. Nzambi Mpungu remains responsible for rainfall and health.
*Aluvaiá (also Bombo Njila, Pambu Njila, Nzila, Mujilo, Mavambo, Vangira, Njila, Maviletango) is an intermediary between human beings and other Nkisi; he is additionally the protector of the houses.
*Nkosi Mukumbe (also Hoji Mukumbi, Panzu, Xauê) is the Nkisi of roads, agriculture, and iron. He is associated with Ogun in Yoruba religion.

<doc id="533853" wikidata="Q4283765" url="?curid=533853" title="List of United States Senate committees">
<text>This is a complete list of U.S. congressional committees (standing committees and select or special committees) that are operating in the United States Senate. Senators can be a member of more than one committee.
==Standing committees==
, there are 88 subsidiary bodies of the US Senate: 16 standing committees with 67 subcommittees, and five non-standing committees.


==Non-standing committees==
There are five non-standing, select, or special committees, which are treated similarly to standing committees.

==Committee classes==
Senate committees are divided, according to relative importance, into three categories: Class A, Class B, and Class C. In general, individual Senators are limited to service on two Class A committees and one Class B committee. Assignment to Class C committees is made without reference to a member&#x27;s service on any other panels.

===Standing committees===
Standing committees are permanent bodies with specific responsibilities spelled out in the Senate&#x27;s rules. Twelve of the sixteen current standing committees are Class A panels: Agriculture; Appropriations; Armed Services; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Energy and Natural Resources; Environment and Public Works; Finance; Foreign Relations; Governmental Affairs; Judiciary; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 

There are four Class B standing committees: Budget, Rules and Administration, Small Business, and Veterans&#x27; Affairs. There are currently no Class C standing committees.

===Other, select and special committees===
Other (i.e., Indian Affairs), select and special committees are ranked as Class B or Class C committees. They are created for clearly specified purposes. There are currently two Class B committees: the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Special Committee on Aging, and two Class C committees: the Select Committee on Indian Affairs and the Select Committee on Ethics. 

===Joint committees===
Joint Committees are used for purposes of legislative and administrative coordination. At present there are four: the Joint Economic Committee (Class B), the Joint Committee on the Library (Class C), the Joint Committee on Printing (Class C), and the Joint Committee on Taxation (Class C).

===Jurisdiction===
Standing committees in the Senate have their jurisdiction set by three primary sources: Senate Rules, ad hoc Senate Resolutions, and Senate Resolutions related to committee funding. To see an overview of the jurisdictions of standing committees in the Senate, see Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XXV.

== Party leadership ==
Each party determines their committees leads, who serve as chair in the majority and ranking member in the minority. The table below lists the tenure of when each member was selected for their current term as committee lead. The Republican party rules stipulate that their leads of standing committees may serve no more than three congressional terms (two years each) as chair or ranking member, unless the full party conference grants them a waiver to do so. The current majority party is listed first for each committee.

<doc id="533860" wikidata="Q233873" url="?curid=533860" title="Teri Garr">
<text>Terry Ann Garr (December 11, 1944 – October 29, 2024), known as Teri Garr, was an American actress. Known for her comedic roles in film and television in the 1970s and 1980s, she often played women struggling to cope with the life-changing experiences of their husbands, children or boyfriends. She received nominations for an Academy Award and a British Academy Film Award for her performance in &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), playing a struggling actress who loses the soap opera role of a female hospital administrator to her male friend and acting coach.

Garr was raised primarily in North Hollywood, California. She was the third child of a comedic-actor father and a studio costumier mother. In her youth, Garr trained in ballet and other forms of dance. She began her career as a teenager with small roles in television and film in the early 1960s, including appearances as a dancer in nine Elvis Presley musicals. After spending two years attending college, Garr left Los Angeles and studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York City. She had her breakthrough appearing in the episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1968.

After gaining attention for her 1974 roles in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Mel Brooks&#x27;s comedy horror &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, Garr became increasingly successful with major roles in Carl Reiner&#x27;s comedy &quot;Oh, God!&quot; and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (both 1977) and &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979). In the 1980s, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her comedic role as an acting student in Sydney Pollack&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Tootsie&quot;, and enjoyed leading roles in Coppola&#x27;s musical drama &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982), &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; (1983), and &quot;Firstborn&quot; (1984). She later acted in films such as Martin Scorsese&#x27;s black comedy &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985), &quot;Let It Ride&quot; (1989), &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994), &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), &quot;Michael&quot; (1996), and &quot;Ghost World&quot; (2001). 

Garr&#x27;s quick wit and charming banter made her a sought-after guest on late-night shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. On television, she took a guest role as Phoebe Abbott in the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1997–98). In 2002, Garr announced that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the symptoms of which had affected her ability to perform. She retired from acting in 2011 and died in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Terry Ann Garr was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 11, 1944. She spent her early years in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and Lakewood, Ohio, before her family settled in Los Angeles. Her father, Eddie Garr (born Edward Leo Gonnoud), was a vaudeville performer, comedian, and actor, whose career peaked when he briefly took over the lead role in the Broadway drama &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. Her mother, Phyllis Lind Garr (born Emma Schmotzer), was a dancer, a Rockette, wardrobe mistress, and model. Her father was of Irish descent and her maternal grandparents were Austrian immigrants. Garr had two older brothers, Ed and Phil.

When Garr was 11, her father died in Los Angeles of a heart attack. She recalled that his death &quot;left us bereft, without any kind of income. And I saw my mother be this incredibly strong, creative woman who put three kids through college—one of my brothers is a surgeon. Any kind of lessons we wanted, we had to have scholarships or sweep the floors. It had to be free. And so we always had to try harder. That was instilled in me very early.&quot; During her youth, Garr expressed interest in dancing and trained extensively in ballet. &quot;I&#x27;d go for three, four hours a day; my feet would be bleeding&quot;, she recalled. &quot;I&#x27;d take buses all over the city just to go to the best dancing schools. You could just stand there and be quiet and beat yourself up, push the body.&quot; Garr graduated from North Hollywood High School, and attended San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge) for two years before dropping out and relocating to New York City to further pursue acting. In New York City, she studied at the Actors Studio and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

==Career==
===Early films and stage===
Early in her career, she was credited as Terry Garr. She later recalled changing her first name to &quot;Teri&quot; on the advice of a numerologist, who said she would be unsuccessful if she had repeating letters in her first and last names. Her movie debut was as an extra in &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Affair&quot; (1963). During her senior year, she auditioned for the cast of the Los Angeles road company production of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, where she met one of the most important people in her early career, David Winters, who became her friend, dance teacher, and mentor. Winters cast her in many of his early movies and projects.

Garr began as a background go-go dancer in uncredited roles in youth-oriented films and TV shows choreographed by Winters, including &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (a beach party film), the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, &quot;Shivaree&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;Movin&#x27; with Nancy&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot; and nine Elvis Presley features (many of which were also choreographed by Winters, including Presley&#x27;s most profitable film, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;). When asked in a magazine interview about how she landed jobs in so many Presley films, Garr answered, &quot;One of the dancers in the road show of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (David Winters) started to choreograph movies, and whatever job he got, I was one of the girls he&#x27;d hire. So he was chosen to do &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;. That was my first movie.&quot;

She often appeared on television during this time, performing as a go-go dancer on several musical variety shows, along with friend Toni Basil, such as &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;. In 1966, Garr made one appearance on &quot;Batman&quot; (episode seven, uncredited). In 1968, she appeared in both &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; and was in two episodes of &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;.

===Film and television; critical acclaim===

Her first speaking role in a motion picture was a brief appearance as a damsel in distress in The Monkees&#x27; film &quot;Head&quot; (1968), written by Jack Nicholson; Garr got the role after meeting Nicholson in an acting class. &quot;He wrote the script for &quot;Head&quot;, so all of us in the class got little tiny parts in the movie,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I was ... Who was I? Oh yes, I was the girl dying of a snakebite, who falls off the Conestoga wagon and says, &#x27;Quick, suck it before the venom reaches my heart!&#x27; &quot; Earlier in that year, she landed her first significant TV role, featured as secretary Roberta Lincoln in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;&quot;, designed as a backdoor pilot episode for a new series that was not commissioned. &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; was the first job where I had a fairly big (for me) speaking part,&quot; Garr related in her memoir, &quot;I played Roberta Lincoln, a dippy secretary in a pink and orange costume with a very short skirt. Had the spin-off succeeded, I would have continued on as an earthling agent, working to preserve humanity. In a very short skirt.&quot; This led to her being, in her words, &quot;cast as birdbrained lasses,&quot; in episodes of other TV shows.

In 1972, she landed a regular role in &quot;The Ken Berry &quot;WOW&quot; Show&quot;, a summer replacement series. Afterward, she was a regular cast member on &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, dancing and acting in comedy sketches.

Garr appeared in a string of highly successful films in the mid-to-late 1970s, including a supporting role in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974). This was followed with her role as Inga, an assistant to Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, in the Mel Brooks horror comedy &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), which marked a career breakthrough. She then appeared in a dramatic role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) as the wife of Richard Dreyfuss&#x27;s character; in &quot;Oh, God!&quot; (1977) as the wife of John Denver&#x27;s character; and the drama &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979) as the mother of the boy protagonist.

In 1978, Garr appeared off-Broadway in a production of &quot;One Crack Out&quot; by Canadian playwright David French, playing the wife of Charlie, a pool hustler in Toronto. Richard Eder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Garr &quot;manages an attractive uncertainty and devotion as Charlie&#x27;s wife.&quot;

In 1982, she starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the comedy &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), playing an actress whose actor friend (Hoffman) disguises himself as a woman to further his career. For her role, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then appeared in the comedy &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; (1983) as the wife of Michael Keaton&#x27;s character, followed by a supporting role in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985).

===Later work and television===

In the 1970s, Garr had a recurring role on &quot;McCloud&quot;, and appeared on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, and &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot;. She hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; three times (in 1980, 1983, and 1985), and was a frequent visitor on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, appearing over 40 times.

As a recurring guest on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, Garr was renowned for her unscripted banter with David Letterman, who once goaded her into showering in his office while the camera rolled. Letterman later apologized to Garr, stating that he came to realize the constant requests for her to shower were &quot;maybe kind of a sexist thing to do.&quot; In 1986, Garr appeared in episode 2223 of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as Amelia Adams, a student of Oscar the Grouch&#x27;s school, Oscar&#x27;s New School For Grouch Research.

Garr had several prominent dramatic roles on television in the 1980s, starring opposite Donald Sutherland in an adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; (1983), in the parody miniseries &quot;Fresno&quot; (1986), and opposite Ellen Burstyn in an adaptation of the play &quot;Pack of Lies&quot; (1987), which earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Drama or Comedy Special.

In 1989, Garr appeared in &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, also opposite Dreyfuss. Her film roles during the 1990s included the role of Marge Nelson in the comedy &quot;Mom and Dad Save the World&quot; (1992), a parody of science fiction films, the stepmother of Lauren Holly&#x27;s character in the comedy &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994), the wife of Danny Aiello&#x27;s character in Robert Altman&#x27;s ensemble film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), and a judge in the fantasy comedy &quot;Michael&quot; (1996). In the late 1990s, Garr landed a role as recurring character Phoebe Abbott in &quot;Friends&quot;, the estranged birth mother of Phoebe Buffay.

Garr&#x27;s career began to slow in the late 1990s after a neurologist informed her that symptoms she had been experiencing for many years were those of multiple sclerosis. In film, she appeared in minor supporting roles, including a witch in the children&#x27;s film &quot;Casper Meets Wendy&quot; (1998) and the mother of Michelle Williams in the political comedy &quot;Dick&quot; (1999). This was followed by an uncredited role in Terry Zwigoff&#x27;s &quot;Ghost World&quot; (2001). She also provided the voice of Mary McGinnis, Terry McGinnis&#x27;s mother, in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001).

Garr returned to the stage in the fall of 2000, appearing in numerous off-Broadway performances of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; opposite Sanaa Lathan and Julianna Margulies. She subsequently had minor supporting roles in the Christmas comedy film &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot; (2006), and the independent comedies &quot;Expired&quot; and &quot;Kabluey&quot; (both 2007).

===Retirement===
In 2006, Garr published an autobiography, &quot;&quot;, which details her career and health struggles after her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Garr appeared on &quot;The Moth Radio Hour&quot; broadcast of December 9, 2009, to tell a humorous reminiscence, &quot;Wake Up Call&quot;.

Garr last acted on television in 2011. She appeared at the 19th Annual Race to Erase MS event in 2012. In 2019, it was revealed Garr had retired from acting in 2011.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
In the early 1980s, Garr was in a seven-year relationship with film executive Roger Birnbaum. After separating from Birnbaum, Garr was in a seven-year relationship with David Kipper, a physician, to whom she was introduced by Carrie Fisher. In 1993, Garr married building contractor John O&#x27;Neil, and that same year, in November, they adopted daughter Molly O&#x27;Neil. The couple divorced in 1996. 

=== Stalking incident ===
In July 1990, a Los Angeles County judge ordered a woman charged with stalking Garr to cease contacting her and to remain away from Garr, her home, and her work locations for three years.

===Political activism===
In March 1988, Garr was arrested for trespassing in Mercury, Nevada, during a protest against nuclear weapons testing in the area.

She participated in events for The Trevor Project, a nonprofit LGBTQ youth suicide prevention organization.

===Illness and death===
In October 2002, Garr confirmed that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. After years of uncertainty and secrecy about her diagnosis, Garr explained her reasons for deciding to go public: 

In interviews, Garr said that she first started noticing symptoms while she was in New York filming &quot;Tootsie&quot; around 1982. After disclosing her condition, she became a National Ambassador for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and National Chair for the Society&#x27;s Women Against MS program (WAMS). In November 2005, Garr was honored as the society&#x27;s Ambassador of the Year. The same year, she revealed her treatment regimen for the disease, which included regular steroid injections to help manage symptoms. &quot;Closer&quot; reported in 2015 that she credited her positive attitude and her family&#x27;s support with helping her fight the disease.

In December 2006, Garr had a ruptured brain aneurysm. The aneurysm left her in a coma for a week, but after therapy, she regained speech and motor skills, and in 2008 she appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to promote &quot;Expired&quot;, a 2007 film in which she played one of a set of twins.

Garr died from complications of multiple sclerosis at her home in Los Angeles surrounded by family and friends, on October 29, 2024, at the age of 79. She is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills, California.

==Legacy and reception==
Garr has been called a &quot;comedic legend.&quot; In 1982, film critic Pauline Kael called her &quot;the funniest neurotic dizzy dame on the screen.&quot; Numerous performers have cited her as an influence, including Jenna Fischer and Tina Fey.

Upon her death, talk show host David Letterman called her &quot;one of &quot;The Late Show&#x27;s&quot; all-time favorite guests&quot; adding, &quot;Teri Garr&#x27;s many appearances on &quot;Late Night&quot; gave it a cachet and importance not possible without her. She was a first class actor and comedian and a lovely human being. She elevated all, and I&#x27;m sad she is gone.&quot; Director Mel Brooks wrote, &quot;She was so talented and so funny. Her humor and lively spirit made the &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; set a pleasure to work on&quot;. Her &quot;Tootsie&quot; co-star Dustin Hoffman released a statement in part reading &quot;Teri was brilliant and singular in all she did, and had a heart of gold. Working with her was one of the great highs. There was no one like her&quot;. Numerous figures in the entertainment industry also paid tribute including Steve Martin, Michael Keaton, Richard Dreyfuss, Lisa Kudrow, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael McKean, Paul Feig and Francis Ford Coppola.

<doc id="533865" wikidata="Q7993410" url="?curid=533865" title="Where Is My Gnome?">
<text>Where is my Gnome? was a viral marketing campaign by Travelocity in early 2004, created by creative agency McKinney. Its mascot, a two-foot tall bearded gnome wearing a blue coat, black boots and a red conical hat, is known as &quot;the Roaming Gnome&quot;.

==Overview==
The advertisements consisted of a man named Bill looking for his garden gnome. On January 3, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; had these advertisements in their publication. The advertisements were inspired by the travelling gnome prank. Since the initiation of the advertising campaign, the Roaming Gnome has become the &quot;de facto&quot; mascot of Travelocity. In 2005 the campaign won a Gold Effie Award for marketing. In order to leverage the then new social media trend, Travelocity created an official page for the Roaming Gnome on MySpace in 2007 and later on Chatroulette, Twitter and Instagram.

After TV advertisements voiced by Harry Enfield were screened nationally on United States networks, and on a Web site &quot;whereismygnome.com&quot;, many readers considered it to be a prank of the Garden Gnome Liberation Front.

As the series progressed, new commercials were aired with updated tag lines: You’ll Never Roam Alone, Go and Smell the Roses and Wander Wisely. For the Wander Wisely campaign, Travelocity hired a new advertising agency, Campbell-Ewald, to feature the company as a trusted travel source. The gnome remains in the commercials; however, he is no longer held against his will, but now works as &quot;The Roaming Gnome: Denouncer of Travel Myths.&quot; In these commercials he discusses two myths, one where the gnome states that Travelocity&#x27;s services are able to denounce the myth, and the other where the gnome ends up causing a mess. In one such commercial, he visits the Bermuda Triangle to see if things really do disappear there, denouncing the myth even as objects disappear behind him until he also vanishes mid-sentence.

In 2006, a major promotion involved 20 Travelocity gnomes carefully hidden throughout the atrium of Gaylord Palms Resort &amp; Convention Center in Kissimmee, Florida. During the resort&#x27;s Best of Florida Christmas promotion, guests were encouraged to find the gnomes to win a cruise to Alaska.

&quot;The Amazing Race&quot; has featured the Roaming Gnome on a leg in multiple seasons where teams are required to pick and carry the Roaming Gnome around while they complete the episode&#x27;s tasks and then bring the Roaming Gnome to the Pit Stop. The Roaming Gnome will usually contain the next clue at the bottom of its base.

==Inspiration==
The concept of the Roaming Gnome and his international escapades dates back to the Travelling gnome prank that began in the 1980s, later reflected in the 2001 French film &quot;Amélie&quot;. In the film, Amelie&#x27;s father finds that his lawn gnome has gone missing. In the mail, he receives pictures of the gnome in exotic landmark locations.

==Credits==
The original campaign was invented by Lisa Shimotakahara and Philip Marchington of McKinney &amp; Silver, an advertising agency in Durham, North Carolina. The tagline, &quot;You&#x27;ll never roam alone&quot;, was written by John Guynn, a copywriter at the same agency. Avant Garde Studio, with lead artists, Amy Medford and Leonid Siveriver, worked with Philip Marchington to design and create the unique look of the Roaming Gnome. Avant Garde Studio is also responsible for sculpting and painting the original 3D sculpture prototypes.

<text>In information technology, a backup, or data backup is a copy of computer data taken and stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event. The verb form, referring to the process of doing so, is &quot;&quot;, whereas the noun and adjective form is &quot;&quot;. Backups can be used to recover data after its loss from data deletion or corruption, or to recover data from an earlier time. Backups provide a simple form of IT disaster recovery; however not all backup systems are able to reconstitute a computer system or other complex configuration such as a computer cluster, active directory server, or database server.

A backup system contains at least one copy of all data considered worth saving. The data storage requirements can be large. An information repository model may be used to provide structure to this storage. There are different types of data storage devices used for copying backups of data that is already in secondary storage onto archive files.&lt;ref group = note name=ArchiveFileMayNotContainOld/HistoricalMaterial&gt;In contrast to everyday use of the term &quot;archive&quot;, the data stored in an &quot;archive file&quot; is not necessarily old or of historical interest.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also different ways these devices can be arranged to provide geographic dispersion, data security, and portability.

Data is selected, extracted, and manipulated for storage. The process can include methods for dealing with live data, including open files, as well as compression, encryption, and de-duplication. Additional techniques apply to enterprise client-server backup. Backup schemes may include dry runs that validate the reliability of the data being backed up. There are limitations and human factors involved in any backup scheme.

==Storage==
A backup strategy requires an information repository, &quot;a secondary storage space for data&quot; that aggregates backups of data &quot;sources&quot;. The repository could be as simple as a list of all backup media (DVDs, etc.) and the dates produced, or could include a computerized index, catalog, or relational database.

The backup data needs to be stored, requiring a backup rotation scheme, which is a system of backing up data to computer media that limits the number of backups of different dates retained separately, by appropriate re-use of the data storage media by overwriting of backups no longer needed. The scheme determines how and when each piece of removable storage is used for a backup operation and how long it is retained once it has backup data stored on it. The 3-2-1 rule can aid in the backup process. It states that there should be at least 3 copies of the data, stored on 2 different types of storage media, and one copy should be kept offsite, in a remote location (this can include cloud storage). 2 or more different media should be used to eliminate data loss due to similar reasons (for example, optical discs may tolerate being underwater while LTO tapes may not, and SSDs cannot fail due to head crashes or damaged spindle motors since they do not have any moving parts, unlike hard drives). An offsite copy protects against fire, theft of physical media (such as tapes or discs) and natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. Physically protected hard drives are an alternative to an offsite copy, but they have limitations like only being able to resist fire for a limited period of time, so an offsite copy still remains as the ideal choice.

Because there is no perfect storage, many backup experts recommend maintaining a second copy on a local physical device, even if the data is also backed up offsite.

===Backup methods===
====Unstructured====
An unstructured repository may simply be a stack of tapes, DVD-Rs or external HDDs with minimal information about what was backed up and when. This method is the easiest to implement, but unlikely to achieve a high level of recoverability as it lacks automation.

====Full only/System imaging====
A repository using this backup method contains complete source data copies taken at one or more specific points in time. Copying system images, this method is frequently used by computer technicians to record known good configurations. However, imaging is generally more useful as a way of deploying a standard configuration to many systems rather than as a tool for making ongoing backups of diverse systems.

====Incremental====
An incremental backup stores data changed since a reference point in time. Duplicate copies of unchanged data are not copied. Typically a full backup of all files is made once or at infrequent intervals, serving as the reference point for an incremental repository. Subsequently, a number of incremental backups are made after successive time periods. Restores begin with the last full backup and then apply the incrementals.
Some backup systems can create a from a series of incrementals, thus providing the equivalent of frequently doing a full backup. When done to modify a single archive file, this speeds restores of recent versions of files.

====Near-CDP====
Continuous Data Protection (CDP) refers to a backup that instantly saves a copy of every change made to the data. This allows restoration of data to any point in time and is the most comprehensive and advanced data protection. Near-CDP backup applications—often marketed as &quot;CDP&quot;—automatically take incremental backups at a specific interval, for example every 15 minutes, one hour, or 24 hours. They can therefore only allow restores to an interval boundary. Near-CDP backup applications use journaling and are typically based on periodic &quot;snapshots&quot;, read-only copies of the data frozen at a particular point in time.

Near-CDP (except for Apple Time Machine) intent-logs every change on the host system, often by saving byte or block-level differences rather than file-level differences. This backup method differs from simple disk mirroring in that it enables a roll-back of the log and thus a restoration of old images of data. Intent-logging allows precautions for the consistency of live data, protecting &quot;self-consistent&quot; files but requiring &quot;applications&quot; &quot;be quiesced and made ready for backup.&quot;

Near-CDP is more practicable for ordinary personal backup applications, as opposed to &quot;true&quot; CDP, which must be run in conjunction with a virtual machine or equivalent and is therefore generally used in enterprise client-server backups.

Software may create copies of individual files such as written documents, multimedia projects, or user preferences, to prevent failed write events caused by power outages, operating system crashes, or exhausted disk space, from causing data loss. A common implementation is an appended &quot;.bak&quot; extension to the file name.

====Reverse incremental====
A Reverse incremental backup method stores a recent archive file &quot;mirror&quot; of the source data and a series of differences between the &quot;mirror&quot; in its current state and its previous states. A reverse incremental backup method starts with a non-image full backup. After the full backup is performed, the system periodically synchronizes the full backup with the live copy, while storing the data necessary to reconstruct older versions. This can either be done using hard links—as Apple Time Machine does, or using binary diffs.

====Differential====
A differential backup saves only the data that has changed since the last full backup. This means a maximum of two backups from the repository are used to restore the data. However, as time from the last full backup (and thus the accumulated changes in data) increases, so does the time to perform the differential backup. Restoring an entire system requires starting from the most recent full backup and then applying just the last differential backup.

A differential backup copies files that have been created or changed since the last full backup, regardless of whether any other differential backups have been made since, whereas an incremental backup copies files that have been created or changed since the most recent backup of any type (full or incremental). Changes in files may be detected through a more recent date/time of last modification file attribute, and/or changes in file size. Other variations of incremental backup include multi-level incrementals and block-level incrementals that compare parts of files instead of just entire files.

===Storage media===

Regardless of the repository model that is used, the data has to be copied onto an archive file data storage medium. The medium used is also referred to as the type of backup destination.

====Magnetic tape====
Magnetic tape was for a long time the most commonly used medium for bulk data storage, backup, archiving, and interchange. It was previously a less expensive option, but this is no longer the case for smaller amounts of data. Tape is a sequential access medium, so the rate of continuously writing or reading data can be very fast. While tape media itself has a low cost per space, tape drives are typically dozens of times as expensive as hard disk drives and optical drives.

Many tape formats have been proprietary or specific to certain markets like mainframes or a particular brand of personal computer. By 2014 LTO had become the primary tape technology. The other remaining viable &quot;super&quot; format is the IBM 3592 (also referred to as the TS11xx series). The Oracle StorageTek T10000 was discontinued in 2016.

====Hard disk====
The use of hard disk storage has increased over time as it has become progressively cheaper. Hard disks are usually easy to use, widely available, and can be accessed quickly. However, hard disk backups are close-tolerance mechanical devices and may be more easily damaged than tapes, especially while being transported. In the mid-2000s, several drive manufacturers began to produce portable drives employing ramp loading and accelerometer technology (sometimes termed a &quot;shock sensor&quot;), and by 2010 the industry average in drop tests for drives with that technology showed drives remaining intact and working after a 36-inch non-operating drop onto industrial carpeting. Some manufacturers also offer &#x27;ruggedized&#x27; portable hard drives, which include a shock-absorbing case around the hard disk, and claim a range of higher drop specifications. Over a period of years the stability of hard disk backups is shorter than that of tape backups.

External hard disks can be connected via local interfaces like SCSI, USB, FireWire, or eSATA, or via longer-distance technologies like Ethernet, iSCSI, or Fibre Channel. Some disk-based backup systems, via Virtual Tape Libraries or otherwise, support data deduplication, which can reduce the amount of disk storage capacity consumed by daily and weekly backup data.

====Optical storage====
Optical storage uses lasers to store and retrieve data. Recordable CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs are commonly used with personal computers and are generally cheap. The capacities and speeds of these discs have typically been lower than hard disks or tapes. Advances in optical media may shrink that gap in the future.

Potential future data losses caused by gradual media degradation can be predicted by measuring the rate of correctable minor data errors, of which consecutively too many increase the risk of uncorrectable sectors. Support for error scanning varies among optical drive vendors.

Many optical disc formats are WORM type, which makes them useful for archival purposes since the data cannot be changed in any way, including by user error and by malware such as ransomware. Moreover, optical discs are not vulnerable to head crashes, magnetism, imminent water ingress or power surges; and, a fault of the drive typically just halts the spinning.

Optical media is modular; the storage controller is not tied to media itself like with hard drives or flash storage (→flash memory controller), allowing it to be removed and accessed through a different drive. However, recordable media may degrade earlier under long-term exposure to light.

Some optical storage systems allow for cataloged data backups without human contact with the discs, allowing for longer data integrity. A French study in 2008 indicated that the lifespan of typically-sold CD-Rs was 2–10 years, but one manufacturer later estimated the longevity of its CD-Rs with a gold-sputtered layer to be as high as 100 years. Sony&#x27;s proprietary Optical Disc Archive can in 2016 reach a read rate of 250 MB/s.

====Solid-state drive====
Solid-state drives (SSDs) use integrated circuit assemblies to store data. Flash memory, thumb drives, USB flash drives, CompactFlash, SmartMedia, Memory Sticks, and Secure Digital card devices are relatively expensive for their low capacity, but convenient for backing up relatively low data volumes. A solid-state drive does not contain any movable parts, making it less susceptible to physical damage, and can have huge throughput of around 500 Mbit/s up to 6 Gbit/s. Available SSDs have become more capacious and cheaper. Flash memory backups are stable for fewer years than hard disk backups.

====Remote backup service====
Remote backup services or cloud backups involve service providers storing data offsite. This has been used to protect against events such as fires, floods, or earthquakes which could destroy locally stored backups. Cloud-based backup (through services like or similar to Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive) provides a layer of data protection. However, the users must trust the provider to maintain the privacy and integrity of their data, with confidentiality enhanced by the use of encryption. Because speed and availability are limited by a user&#x27;s online connection, users with large amounts of data may need to use cloud seeding and large-scale recovery.

===Management===
Various methods can be used to manage backup media, striking a balance between accessibility, security and cost. These media management methods are not mutually exclusive and are frequently combined to meet the user&#x27;s needs. Using on-line disks for staging data before it is sent to a near-line tape library is a common example.

====Online====
Online backup storage is typically the most accessible type of data storage, and can begin a restore in milliseconds. An internal hard disk or a disk array (maybe connected to SAN) is an example of an online backup. This type of storage is convenient and speedy, but is vulnerable to being deleted or overwritten, either by accident, by malevolent action, or in the wake of a data-deleting virus payload.

====Near-line====
Nearline storage is typically less accessible and less expensive than online storage, but still useful for backup data storage. A mechanical device is usually used to move media units from storage into a drive where the data can be read or written. Generally it has safety properties similar to on-line storage. An example is a tape library with restore times ranging from seconds to a few minutes.

====Off-line====
Off-line storage requires some direct action to provide access to the storage media: for example, inserting a tape into a tape drive or plugging in a cable. Because the data is not accessible via any computer except during limited periods in which they are written or read back, they are largely immune to on-line backup failure modes. Access time varies depending on whether the media are on-site or off-site.

====Off-site data protection====
Backup media may be sent to an off-site vault to protect against a disaster or other site-specific problem. The vault can be as simple as a system administrator&#x27;s home office or as sophisticated as a disaster-hardened, temperature-controlled, high-security bunker with facilities for backup media storage. A data replica can be off-site but also on-line (e.g., an off-site RAID mirror).

====Backup site====
A backup site or disaster recovery center is used to store data that can enable computer systems and networks to be restored and properly configured in the event of a disaster. Some organisations have their own data recovery centres, while others contract this out to a third-party. Due to high costs, backing up is rarely considered the preferred method of moving data to a DR site. A more typical way would be remote disk mirroring, which keeps the DR data as up to date as possible.

==Selection and extraction of data==
A backup operation starts with selecting and extracting coherent units of data. Most data on modern computer systems is stored in discrete units, known as files. These files are organized into filesystems. Deciding what to back up at any given time involves tradeoffs. By backing up too much redundant data, the information repository will fill up too quickly. Backing up an insufficient amount of data can eventually lead to the loss of critical information.

===Files===
*Copying files: Making copies of files is the simplest and most common way to perform a backup. A means to perform this basic function is included in all backup software and all operating systems.
*Partial file copying: A backup may include only the blocks or bytes within a file that have changed in a given period of time. This can substantially reduce needed storage space, but requires higher sophistication to reconstruct files in a restore situation. Some implementations require integration with the source file system.
*Deleted files: To prevent the unintentional restoration of files that have been intentionally deleted, a record of the deletion must be kept.
*Versioning of files: Most backup applications, other than those that do only full only/System imaging, also back up files that have been modified since the last backup. &quot;That way, you can retrieve many different versions of a given file, and if you delete it on your hard disk, you can still find it in your [information repository] archive.&quot;

===Filesystems===
*Filesystem dump: A copy of the whole filesystem in block-level can be made. This is also known as a &quot;raw partition backup&quot; and is related to disk imaging. The process usually involves unmounting the filesystem and running a program like dd (Unix). Because the disk is read sequentially and with large buffers, this type of backup can be faster than reading every file normally, especially when the filesystem contains many small files, is highly fragmented, or is nearly full. But because this method also reads the free disk blocks that contain no useful data, this method can also be slower than conventional reading, especially when the filesystem is nearly empty. Some filesystems, such as XFS, provide a &quot;dump&quot; utility that reads the disk sequentially for high performance while skipping unused sections. The corresponding restore utility can selectively restore individual files or the entire volume at the operator&#x27;s choice.
*Identification of changes: Some filesystems have an archive bit for each file that says it was recently changed. Some backup software looks at the date of the file and compares it with the last backup to determine whether the file was changed.
*Versioning file system: A versioning filesystem tracks all changes to a file. The NILFS versioning filesystem for Linux is an example.

===Live data===
Files that are actively being updated present a challenge to back up. One way to back up live data is to temporarily quiesce them (e.g., close all files), take a &quot;snapshot&quot;, and then resume live operations. At this point the snapshot can be backed up through normal methods. A snapshot is an instantaneous function of some filesystems that presents a copy of the filesystem as if it were frozen at a specific point in time, often by a copy-on-write mechanism. Snapshotting a file while it is being changed results in a corrupted file that is unusable. This is also the case across interrelated files, as may be found in a conventional database or in applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server. The term fuzzy backup can be used to describe a backup of live data that looks like it ran correctly, but does not represent the state of the data at a single point in time.

Backup options for data files that cannot be or are not quiesced include:
*Open file backup: Many backup software applications undertake to back up open files in an internally consistent state. Some applications simply check whether open files are in use and try again later. Other applications exclude open files that are updated very frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArqTroubleshootingBackingUpOpen/lockedFiles&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some low-availability interactive applications can be backed up via natural/induced pausing.
*Interrelated database files backup: Some interrelated database file systems offer a means to generate a &quot;hot backup&quot; of the database while it is online and usable. This may include a snapshot of the data files plus a snapshotted log of changes made while the backup is running. Upon a restore, the changes in the log files are applied to bring the copy of the database up to the point in time at which the initial backup ended. Other low-availability interactive applications can be backed up via coordinated snapshots. However, genuinely-high-availability interactive applications can be only be backed up via Continuous Data Protection.

===Metadata===
Not all information stored on the computer is stored in files. Accurately recovering a complete system from scratch requires keeping track of this non-file data too.
*System description: System specifications are needed to procure an exact replacement after a disaster.
*Boot sector: The boot sector can sometimes be recreated more easily than saving it. It usually isn&#x27;t a normal file and the system won&#x27;t boot without it.
*Partition layout: The layout of the original disk, as well as partition tables and filesystem settings, is needed to properly recreate the original system.
*File metadata: Each file&#x27;s permissions, owner, group, ACLs, and any other metadata need to be backed up for a restore to properly recreate the original environment.
*System metadata: Different operating systems have different ways of storing configuration information. Microsoft Windows keeps a registry of system information that is more difficult to restore than a typical file.

==Manipulation of data and dataset optimization==
It is frequently useful or required to manipulate the data being backed up to optimize the backup process. These manipulations can improve backup speed, restore speed, data security, media usage and/or reduced bandwidth requirements.

===Automated data grooming=== 
Out-of-date data can be automatically deleted, but for personal backup applications—as opposed to enterprise client-server backup applications where automated data &quot;grooming&quot; can be customized—the deletion can at most be globally delayed or be disabled.

===Compression=== 
Various schemes can be employed to shrink the size of the source data to be stored so that it uses less storage space. Compression is frequently a built-in feature of tape drive hardware.

===Deduplication=== 
Redundancy due to backing up similarly configured workstations can be reduced, thus storing just one copy. This technique can be applied at the file or raw block level. This potentially large reduction is called deduplication. It can occur on a server before any data moves to backup media, sometimes referred to as source/client side deduplication. This approach also reduces bandwidth required to send backup data to its target media. The process can also occur at the target storage device, sometimes referred to as inline or back-end deduplication.

===Duplication=== 
Sometimes backups are duplicated to a second set of storage media. This can be done to rearrange the archive files to optimize restore speed, or to have a second copy at a different location or on a different storage medium—as in the disk-to-disk-to-tape capability of Enterprise client-server backup.

===Encryption=== 
High-capacity removable storage media such as backup tapes present a data security risk if they are lost or stolen. Encrypting the data on these media can mitigate this problem, however encryption is a CPU intensive process that can slow down backup speeds, and the security of the encrypted backups is only as effective as the security of the key management policy.

===Multiplexing===
When there are many more computers to be backed up than there are destination storage devices, the ability to use a single storage device with several simultaneous backups can be useful. However cramming the scheduled backup window via &quot;multiplexed backup&quot; is only used for tape destinations.

===Refactoring=== 
The process of rearranging the sets of backups in an archive file is known as refactoring. For example, if a backup system uses a single tape each day to store the incremental backups for all the protected computers, restoring one of the computers could require many tapes. Refactoring could be used to consolidate all the backups for a single computer onto a single tape, creating a &quot;synthetic full backup&quot;. This is especially useful for backup systems that do incrementals forever style backups.

===Staging=== 
Sometimes backups are copied to a staging disk before being copied to tape. This process is sometimes referred to as D2D2T, an acronym for Disk-to-disk-to-tape. It can be useful if there is a problem matching the speed of the final destination device with the source device, as is frequently faced in network-based backup systems. It can also serve as a centralized location for applying other data manipulation techniques.

===Objectives===
*Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time that the restarted infrastructure will reflect, expressed as &quot;the maximum targeted period in which data (transactions) might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident&quot;. Essentially, this is the roll-back that will be experienced as a result of the recovery. The most desirable RPO would be the point just prior to the data loss event. Making a more recent recovery point achievable requires increasing the frequency of synchronization between the source data and the backup repository.
*Recovery time objective (RTO): The amount of time elapsed between disaster and restoration of business functions.
*Data security: In addition to preserving access to data for its owners, data must be restricted from unauthorized access. Backups must be performed in a manner that does not compromise the original owner&#x27;s undertaking. This can be achieved with data encryption and proper media handling policies.
*Data retention period: Regulations and policy can lead to situations where backups are expected to be retained for a particular period, but not any further. Retaining backups after this period can lead to unwanted liability and sub-optimal use of storage media.
*Checksum or hash function validation: Applications that back up to tape archive files need this option to verify that the data was accurately copied.
*Backup process monitoring: Enterprise client-server backup applications need a user interface that allows administrators to monitor the backup process, and proves compliance to regulatory bodies outside the organization; for example, an insurance company in the USA might be required under HIPAA to demonstrate that its client data meet records retention requirements.
*User-initiated backups and restores: To avoid or recover from &quot;minor&quot; disasters, such as inadvertently deleting or overwriting the &quot;good&quot; versions of one or more files, the computer user—rather than an administrator—may initiate backups and restores (from not necessarily the most-recent backup) of files or folders.

<text>The Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA; ) is a museum of architecture and research centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is located at 1920, rue Baile (1920, Baile Street), between rue Fort (Fort Street) and rue Saint-Marc (Saint-Marc Street) in what was once part of the Golden Square Mile. Today, it is considered to be located in the Shaughnessy Village neighbourhood of the borough of Ville-Marie.

Phyllis Lambert is the founding director emerita, Bruce Kuwabara is chair of the board of trustees, Giovanna Borasi is the director. 

The CCA contains a large library and archives, and is host to various exhibits throughout the year. It is also home to a study centre open to the general public. The CCA provides educational programs and cultural activities.

The CCA was designed and built by Peter Rose. It has an architectural garden located on the southern side of René Lévesque Boulevard. The sculpture garden was designed by architect Melvin Charney.

== History ==
The CCA was founded in 1979 by Montreal architect Phyllis Lambert. The purpose of the centre was to promote public awareness of the role architecture plays in society, as well as to encourage scholarly architectural research and to foster innovative design practices.

The CCA was designed and constructed between 1985 and 1989 by Montreal architect Peter Rose. The design of the museum incorporates the Shaughnessy House mansion, built for Thomas Shaughnessy, a Second Empire-style mansion that Lambert purchased in 1974 to prevent its demolition.

The CCA received the &quot;Honor Award for Architecture&quot; from the American Institute of Architects and the Governor General&#x27;s Medals in Architecture in 1992.

== Building ==

The current building, which opened in 1989, surrounds Shaughnessy House and was designed by Peter Rose, in collaboration with Phyllis Lambert and Erol Argun. The historic Shaughnessy House, located at 1923 Dorchester Street West (today René Lévesque Boulevard), was built in 1874 according to plans by William Tutin Thomas. It is one of the few nineteenth-century mansions in Montreal that is accessible to the public.

The CCA building, with a surface area of roughly , is home to exhibit halls, the Paul Desmarais Theatre, a bookstore, the library, and a study centre in the Alcan Wing. It also contains restoration laboratories and conservation offices. The work of conservation and restoration of Shaughnessy House, with a floor area of over , was carried out under the direction of Denis Saint-Louis. Also inside is the Devencore Conservatory and reception rooms.

Due to its size, location and use of traditional and modern materials, combining structural aluminum with grey Montreal limestone, the CCA building&#x27;s architecture blends past and present. Its landscapes, including the CCA sculpture garden facing the building on the south side of René Lévesque Boulevard, were designed according to the ecology of each location. Most of the rooms at Shaughnessy House have been restored to their original 1874 state.

The &quot;Van Horne / Shaughnessy House&quot; was listed as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973, and as a Historical Monument of Quebec on 6 February 1974.

== Collection and exhibits ==
The CCA has large collections of books and artifacts touching on the built environment and certain aspects of industrial design. Within the general collections it has special collections such as those pertaining to architectural games for children, universal exhibitions and their architecture, and significant architects including Ernest Cormier, Peter Eisenman, Arthur Erickson, John Hejduk, Cedric Price, Aldo Rossi, James Stirling, and the artist Gordon Matta-Clark.

The centre holds regular exhibitions made up of research on thematic subjects, different aspects of its collections, and hosts touring exhibits from other museums. The centre offers tours adapted to specific groups and educational programs for children. It also has a bookstore, a concert hall, and gardens. The sculpture garden which lies across René Lévesque Boulevard offers a full scale ghost-like lower shell of the bottom part of the Shaughnessy mansion, and assorted modernistic sculptures or constructs which are developed around the theme of architecture.

The centre&#x27;s study room is open to the public by appointment. It celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009.

== Lectures series ==
Over the years, CCA has organized a variety of lectures and presentations, for example by Evgeny Morozov and Johannes Grenzfurthner.

== Sculpture garden ==
The mansion faces a sculpture garden by Melvin Charney on the south side of René Lévesque Boulevard. Located in between René-Lévesque Boulevard and the Ville-Marie Expressway, it is a park, Esplanade Ernest Cormier, in an area of heavy traffic and is at the edge of a cliff. The park contains a set of sculptures that depict aspects of architecture, and include a reproduction of the base of the facade and size of Shaughnessy House. The vegetation is mixed with sections of open walls. Architectural fixtures and furniture items are placed on pedestals.

== Affiliations ==
The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>MusicMatch Jukebox was media player software made by San Diego–based MusicMatch, Inc. It provided the ability to manage digital audio files and playlists, audio file conversion, an online music store, Internet radio, Compact Disc Digital Audio playback, CD ripper capabilities, and managing digital media on portable media players.

The company&#x27;s Radio MX service allowed users choose the artist they want to listen to but not the song.

==History==
MusicMatch Jukebox was launched in 1997.

MusicMatch Jukebox was bundled with the iPod Classic as its music manager until the introduction of iTunes for Microsoft Windows in 2003.

In September 2003, the company launched a digital music store with 200,000 songs available. The company entered into a partnership with Dell to promote the service and software.

In October 2004, Yahoo acquired Musicmatch for $160 million. However, the service was not integrated well, instead stagnating.

On August 31, 2007, Yahoo! discontinued MusicMatch services in an effort to move users to Yahoo! Music.

<text>Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Gerald Rideout (born June 25, 1948) is a former Canadian politician who served as the fourth premier of Newfoundland from March 22, 1989 to May 5, 1989.

==Life and career==
Born in Fleur de Lys, Newfoundland, Rideout was first elected to the provincial House of Assembly in the 1975 general election as a Liberal but left the party in 1980 to join the Progressive Conservative government of Premier Brian Peckford in its fight with Ottawa for control of offshore petroleum resources. Rideout became minister of culture, recreation and youth in 1984 and became minister of fisheries in 1985. With Peckford&#x27;s retirement from politics in 1989, Rideout was chosen Tory party leader and thus became premier of Newfoundland. One month later at the 1989 provincial election, the Progressive Conservatives narrowly won a higher percentage of votes than the Liberal Party led by Clyde Wells, but the Liberals won the most seats and Wells replaced Rideout as Premier. Rideout remained Leader of the Opposition until October 1991 when he left politics for a federal appointment as a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

Rideout attempted a political comeback in the 1993 federal election, running as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Gander—Grand Falls, but was defeated by Liberal incumbent George Baker.

In 1997, he obtained his law degree from the University of Ottawa, and was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1998.

In 1999, he re-entered public life, and was elected as a Progressive Conservative Member of the House of Assembly for the district of Lewisporte. He was re-elected in 2003, when the PC Party formed the government. He was appointed Minister Responsible for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister of Works, Services &amp; Transportation (the name of which was later changed to Transportation and Works). In addition to these portfolios, Rideout served as acting Minister of Health and Community Services from September 27 to October 1, 2004. On November 8, 2005, Rideout was appointed Minister of Fisheries and Deputy Premier. In the 2007 general election he switched districts and ran in Baie Verte-Springdale, the district he had represented in the House of Assembly from 1975 until 1991.

On May 21, 2008, Rideout tendered his resignation as Deputy Premier, Government House Leader and Minister of Fisheries in the provincial government, in a dispute with the Premier&#x27;s Office over road funding in his electoral district of Baie Verte-Springdale. On June 30, 2008, Rideout resigned from politics altogether, tendering his resignation as a Member of the House of Assembly.

In 2017, Rideout endorsed Ches Crosbie in the 2018 provincial PC leadership race.

<text>The University of Poitiers (UP; , ) is a public university located in Poitiers, France. It is a member of the Coimbra Group. It is multidisciplinary and contributes to making Poitiers the city with the highest student/inhabitant ratio in France by welcoming nearly 28,000 students in 2017.

The University of Poitiers represents a global operating budget of around 150 million euros per year, one-third of which is for operating and investment costs and two-thirds for personnel costs. As of July 2015 it is a member of the regional university association
Leonardo da Vinci consolidated University.

==History==
Founded in 1431 by Pope Eugene IV and chartered by King Charles VII, the University of Poitiers was originally composed of five faculties: theology, canon law, civil law, medicine, and arts.

In the 16th century, the university exerted its influence over the town cultural life, and was ranked second only to Paris. Of the 4,000 students who attended it at the time, some were to become famous: Joachim Du Bellay, Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac, François Rabelais, René Descartes, and Scévole de Sainte-Marthe, to name but a few.

After temporary closure during the French Revolution when provincial universities were abolished, the University of Poitiers reopened in 1796. The reinstated university was merged from several schools and contained new faculties such as the faculty of science and the faculty of letters.

They established the École nationale supérieure d&#x27;ingénieurs de Poitiers, a department which trains engineers, in 1984 after having created the &quot;Institut de sciences et techniques de Poitiers&quot;, its predecessor.

The first Confucius Institute in France was created on the campus in 2005 with the cooperation of Nanchang University and Jiujiang University.

After having managed its payroll and budget since January 1, 2010, the University of Poitiers is the third university in France to have its premises.

In late 2011 the university changed its logo. They submitted four so that students and the staff were able to decide. The up-to-date logo is based on the original coat of arms while the former was something modern. Over 9,000 people participated in the selection of the new logo.

In 2012, the university launched a blogging platform where the teaching staff and researchers deal with topical subjects, each in their area of expertise. The slogan is &quot;the word of experts&quot;.

==Organization==

<doc id="533898" wikidata="Q5089917" url="?curid=533898" title="Chellaston">
<text>Chellaston is a suburban village on the southern outskirts of Derby, in Derbyshire, England.

== History ==
An early mention of Chellaston is thought to be a reference to Ceolarde&#x27;s hill. This is mentioned in a 1009 charter when nearby land was given to Morcar by King Æthelred the Unready. Historically, Chellaston has been part of the Hundred of Repton and Gresley.

Chellaston was a separate village and was worth three shillings when the king gave it to Henry de Ferrers in the 11th century. It is mentioned as &quot;Celerdestune&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Throughout the centuries, Chellaston grew slowly. By 1676, the village had grown to a population of around 140, and there were still only 42 houses in Chellaston in 1789. There may have been up to two manor houses in Chellaston, but these residences were abandoned sometime around the 17th century. One of them is thought to have been located at the end of the present-day Manor Road.

It is rumoured that Robin Hood was born at a manor house in Chellaston. This claim is mentioned in several directories and gazetteers published in the 19th century, but there is no evidence to substantiate this legend. However, Philip Marc, the local sheriff at the time of the robin hoods legend, had real associations with Chellaston.

Chellaston was once one of the largest producers of mined alabaster in the United Kingdom, which was used to produce Nottingham Alabaster. By the end of the 18th century, Chellaston was exporting its poor grades of alabaster as gypsum and it was transported via the local canals for markets in Derby and The Potteries. It was even used by Josiah Wedgwood for plaster moulds to shape his pottery. The remains of Chellaston&#x27;s pits can be found at the bottom of Pit Close Lane and Woodgate Drive, and the site is now popular with BMX bikers and teenagers.

Chellaston grew substantially between 1880 and 1950, with a number of areas being developed for housing. These developments included housing around Glenwood Road, Station Road, and north of Sutton Avenue. After 1950, the village grew even more: houses were built in the Springfield Road and St Peter&#x27;s Road areas, among others. By the 1990s, extensive housing complexes had emerged, most notably on Sutton Avenue, Maple Drive, and Parkway.

As of 2009, Chellaston has become a large Derby suburb; much larger than the original village. Two distinct housing estates to the east and west of the centre have been built. The eastern estate can be found on Snelsmoor Lane, and the west estate sprawls in an arc from the Bonnie Prince public house on Swarkestone Road to the bottom of Sinfin Moor Lane and Baltimore Bridge.

== Government ==
Chellaston formerly lay within the South Derbyshire parliamentary constituency, but moved to Derby South following the electoral boundaries review of 2007. The newly formed Chellaston Fields settlement to the southern edge of Chellaston continue to fall under South Derbyshire. In local council elections, Chellaston is part of the Chellaston ward.

The current councillors for Chellaston and Shelton Lock are Conservative&#x27;s Harvey Jennings and two independent candidates, husband &amp; wife, Philip and Celia Ingall as of 6 May 2022, with Celia replacing Conservative councillor, Ross McCristal.

In 1961 the civil parish had a population of 3702. On 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished and merged with Derby, Elvaston, Aston upon Trent and Swarkestone. It is now in the unparished area of Derby, in the Derby district.

== Geography ==
Chellaston lies about south of Derby city centre, and is the southernmost part of the city. It borders Shelton Lock to the north and South Derbyshire to the south. The southern edge of Chellaston also known as Chellaston Fields, formed by Regents Place Estate and the adjacent Retail Park, falls under South Derbyshire District and isn’t part of Derby City.

== Demography ==
At the 2011 United Kingdom census the population was 15,198 - an increase of 24.95% from 2001. 86.2% are White British, compared to 75.3% for Derby as a whole.
== Economy ==
Chellaston has a Co-operative supermarket on the corner of High Street and Derby Road. The Post Office is located on Derby Road near Station Road, next to Chellaston Garage (a small car repair business) and a Cantonese takeaway – Ming&#x27;s Court (which used to be a petrol station). A Tesco Express was housed on the site next to the garage until April 2011, when it moved to new premises in the former Red Lion public house.

== Culture and community ==
In the late 2000s, a local public library was built between the community centre and the Co-operative supermarket. There is also a children&#x27;s playground next to the Chellaston Community Centre, which is situated on Barley Croft, off High Street. The bowls club can be traced back to 1905. 

The site of the former Chellaston Brickworks is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. Chellaston has intermittently hosted an annual summer carnival complete with floats. Floats were contributed by local groups such as the Scouts and Guides, churches of all denominations, and Chellaston Junior School. The carnival usually took place on the recreation ground, next to the community centre on Barley Croft, but has not been held since the late 1990s.

The Chellaston Beauty tulip was developed in the early 1850s; its flower has a white base and variegated tips in near black.

Before being converted into a public house, The Bonnie Prince used to be a grand private residence named Home Lea, home to the Osbourne family in 1901.

== Landmarks ==
No.4 Swarkestone Road probably originates from the 16th century but has been much altered since. White House Farm on the High Street is a Grade II-listed farmhouse and stables dating from the early 18th century. Pear Tree Cottage at No.49 Derby Road has a plaque dated 1799, though this date is disputed. Opposite the church, at No.84 High Street, is the former village shop, which is Grade II-listed as it is relatively unchanged since the early 19th century.

== Transport ==
The main road through Chellaston is Derby Road A514, which becomes Swarkestone Road at the crossroads with High Street. Approximately 1000 new homes have been built to the west of Chellaston, close to the route of the disused and in-filled Derby Canal.

Formerly, the suburb had its own railway station (at the bottom of Station Road), but little trace of the site exists today. The station&#x27;s full name was Chellaston and Swarkestone. The main public transport link is the bus service, which journeys either side of Chellaston as far as Derby and Swadlincote.

== Education ==
There are five schools; Chellaston Infant School on School Lane, Chellaston Junior School on Maple Drive, Homefields Primary School on Parkway and Chellaston Academy (senior school and 6th form college) on Swarkestone Road. Chellaston Academy&#x27;s catchment area includes the nearby villages of Melbourne, Aston-on-Trent, Ticknall, Barrow upon Trent and Weston-on-Trent. Chellaston Fields is the fifth school,located near Aldi which is on the outskirts of the village, towards the A50 and Swarkestone.

== Religious sites ==
There are two churches in Chellaston: St. Peter&#x27;s Church (Church of England) on St. Peter&#x27;s Road, and the Methodist Church on High Street. St. Peter&#x27;s dates from the 15th century although it was largely rebuilt in 1842. The two churches have a signed an ecumenical covenant together, and hold a joint service every month. There used to be a Baptist church in Chellaston near Pear Tree Cottage on Derby Road. There also used to be the St. Ralph Sherwin Church Catholic on Swarkestone Road next to Chellaston School, but this was demolished in 2019 along with the Rose and Crown pub to make way for a Lidl supermarket.

== Sport ==
Chellaston Park on Snelsmoor Lane includes a children&#x27;s playground, football 3G floodlit courts and grass pitches, a cricket pitch and changing facilities.


The pavilion and sporting facilities are managed by &#x27;not for profit&#x27; organisation, Chellaston Leisure Limited.

AFC Chellaston (formally Chellaston Boys &amp; Girls FC); an FA Charter Standard Community Football Club founded in 1992. The club is based at Snelsmoor Park in Chellaston. The club, run by volunteers, has approx. 50 teams, playing in the Derby, Burton and Nottingham junior and adult football leagues. Players are aged from 3 right through to adult and there are approx. 500 registered players within the club.

Chellaston Cricket Club plays in the Derbyshire County Cricket Leagues, with adult and junior teams were formed in 2021 and have adopted Chellaston Park as their home ground.

<text>Jerome &quot;Jerry&quot; Hal Lemelson (July 18, 1923 – October 1, 1997) was an American engineer, inventor, and patent holder. Several of his inventions relate to warehouses, industrial robots, cordless telephones, fax machines, videocassette recorders, camcorders, and the magnetic tape drive. Lemelson&#x27;s 605 patents made him one of the most prolific inventors in American history.

Lemelson was an advocate for the rights of independent inventors; he served on a federal advisory committee on patent issues from 1976 to 1979. A series of patent litigations and subsequent licensing negotiations made him a controversial figure, seen as staunch supporter for the rights of independent inventors, while criticized by patent attorneys and directors of some of the companies with whom he was involved in litigation.

In 1993, Lemelson and his family established the Lemelson Foundation, a philanthropy with the mission to support invention and innovation to improve lives in the United States and developing countries.

==Biography==

Lemelson was born on Staten Island, New York, on July 18, 1923, the oldest of three brothers. His father was a physician of Austrian-Jewish descent. His first invention, as a child, was for a lighted tongue depressor that his father, a local physician, could use. He also ran a business in his basement as a teenager, making and selling gas-powered model airplanes.

He attended New York University after serving during World War II in the United States Army Air Corps engineering department. His experience with teaching African American engineers, in segregated units in the Army, led to a lifelong interest in civil rights and in particular promoting the education of minority engineering students.

After the war he received two master&#x27;s degrees: in aeronautical as well as industrial engineering. He worked for the Office of Naval Research on Project SQUID, a postwar effort to develop pulse jet and rocket engines and then Republic Aviation, designing guided missiles. After taking a job as a safety engineer at a smelting plant in New Jersey, he quit because he claimed the company would not implement safety improvements Lemelson believed could save lives. This was his last job before becoming an independent inventor.

Lemelson&#x27;s first major invention involved utilizing a universal robot, for use in a variety of industrial systems, that could do numerous actions such as welding, moving and measuring products, and utilized optical image technology to scan for flaws in the production line. He wrote a 150-page application which he submitted for his first patent, on what he termed &quot;machine vision&quot;, in 1954. Parts of these automated warehousing systems he licensed to the Triax Corporation in 1964.

During the 1950s, he also worked on systems for video filing of data utilizing magnetic or videotape to record documents, which could be read either on a monitor or from stop frame images. This process, along with mechanisms to control and manipulate the tape, were later licensed to Sony in 1974 for use in both audio and video cassette players. During this period, he also worked on a series of patents developing aspects of data and word processing technologies. He licensed twenty of these patents to IBM in 1981. IBM offered him a position running one of their research divisions, which Lemelson declined because he wanted to remain an independent inventor. He also developed a series of patents on the manufacturing of integrated circuits, which he licensed to Texas Instruments in 1961. While working during this period on complex industrial products, ranging across the fields of robotics, lasers, computers, and electronics, Lemelson utilized some of the concepts in these more &quot;high tech&quot; areas and applied them to a variety of toy concepts, receiving patents for velcro target games, wheeled toys, board games, and improvements on the classic propeller beanie, among others. An exhibit of his toy inventions was shown in 2012 at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

This cross-pollination across disparate fields was typical for Lemelson, and can be seen in how he devised ideas and patents for new ways of making semiconductors. While watching and reading about the problems with the heating and subsequent oxidation on heat shields of rockets re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, Lemelson realized that this same process could operate on the molecular level when electrical resistance in a silicon wafer creates an insulative barrier and thus provides for more efficient conduction of electric current.

From 1957 on, he worked exclusively as an independent inventor. From this period onwards, Lemelson received an average of one patent a month for more than 40 years, in technological fields related to automated warehouses, industrial robots, cordless telephones, fax machines, videocassette recorders illuminated highway markers, camcorders and a magnetic tape drive. As an independent inventor, Lemelson wrote, sketched, and filed almost all of his patent applications himself, with little help from outside counsel.

Lemelson was described as a &quot;workaholic&quot;, spending 12 to 14 hours a day writing up his ideas, and often as much as 18 hours a day tinkering. His notebooks holding these ideas numbered in the thousands. Lemelson&#x27;s younger brother said that when they were roommates in college, after they would go to sleep, the light would go on several times during the night and Lemelson would write something down. In the morning, Lemelson&#x27;s brother would read and witness the several inventions that Lemelson had conceived that previous night. His brother stated, &quot;This happened every night, seven days a week&quot;.

Lemelson died in 1997, after a one-year battle with liver cancer. In the final year of his life, he applied for over 40 patents, many of them in the biomedical field related to cancer detection and treatment, including a &quot;Computerized medical diagnostic system&quot; () and several &quot;Medical devices using electrosensitive gels,&quot; all issuing posthumously. In 2009, 12 years after his death, , for a &quot;Facial-recognition vehicle security system,&quot; was issued in Lemelson&#x27;s name.

Lemelson was a staunch advocate for the rights of independent inventors. He served on a federal advisory committee on patent issues from 1976 to 1979. In this capacity, he advocated for a variety of issues, including protecting the secrecy of patent applications and advocating for the &quot;first to invent&quot; patent system. In his testimony before the Patent Trademark Office Advisory Committee, he decried what he believed as an &quot;innovation crisis&quot;, and that the barriers, such as high legal and filing costs as well as failures of the courts to protect the rights of independent inventors, were creating a negative environment for American inventors and US technological ascendancy.

==Patents and litigation==
Lemelson was granted more than 600 patents, making him one of the 20th century&#x27;s most prolific patent grantees.

Through much of his later career, Lemelson was involved in a series of patent litigations and subsequent licensing negotiations. As a result, he was both excoriated by his legal opponents and hailed as a hero by many independent inventors. For example, Lemelson claimed he had invented the &quot;flexible track&quot; used in the popular &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; toys manufactured by Mattel. In the 1980s Lemelson sued for willful patent infringement, from which he initially won a substantial judgement in a jury trial. This case was later overturned on appeal. Later that same year, Lemelson won a $17 million judgement against Illinois Tool Works for infringement on a robot tool spraying device, which was upheld on appeal.

Lemelson litigated extensively on the basis of what he termed his &quot;machine vision&quot; patents, the earliest of which dates from the mid-1950s. These patents described scanning visual data from a camera, which are then stored in a computer. Combining with robotic devices and bar coders, this technology could be used to check, manipulate, or evaluate the products moving down an assembly line. Items or products could then be adjusted or sent on to different parts of a factory for further procedures. Lemelson also sued a variety of Japanese and European automotive and electronics manufacturers for infringing on his machine vision patents. Lemelson and these companies reached a settlement, with the companies taking a license to the patents, in 1990-1991.

Lemelson later utilized this strategy in attempting to reach settlements over alleged patent infringement with American companies. He first sued, then negotiated and received royalties from a variety of corporations. He was controversial for his alleged use of submarine patents to negotiate licenses worth over $1.3 billion from major corporations in a variety of industries. Partially as a result of his filing a succession of continuation applications, a number of his patents (particularly those in the field of industrial machine vision) were delayed, in some cases by several decades. This had the effect of taking the industry by surprise when the patents in question finally issued. 
Lemelson&#x27;s tactics effectively resulted in these industries growing and flourishing without being aware of the impending patent-infringement lawsuits. This effectively translated into large, highly profitable lawsuit targets.
Lemelson claimed that the bureaucracy of the US Patent Office was also responsible for the long delays. The courts, in the Symbol and Cognex case discussed below, however found that Lemelson had engaged in &quot;culpable neglect&quot; and noted that &quot;Lemelson patents occupied the top thirteen positions for the longest prosecutions from 1914 to 2001.&quot; However, they found no convincing evidence of inequitable conduct. Indeed, Lemelson always claimed that he followed all the rules and regulations of the United States Patent Office.

In 2004, Lemelson&#x27;s estate was defeated in a notable court case involving Symbol Technologies and Cognex Corporation, which sought (and received) a ruling that 76 claims under Lemelson&#x27;s machine vision patents were unenforceable. The plaintiff companies, with the support of dozens of industry supporters, spent millions on this case. The ruling was upheld on September 9, 2005 by a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under the doctrine of laches, citing &quot;unreasonably long […] delays in prosecution&quot;. Lemelson&#x27;s estate appealed for a review by the full circuit en banc. On November 16, 2005, the full court declined to review the case, and, citing &quot;prejudice to the public as a whole,&quot; extended the original unenforceability ruling to &quot;all&quot; claims under the patents in question. However, the judge also ruled that Cognex and Symbol did not demonstrate that Lemelson had &quot;intentionally stalled&quot; getting the patents. Lemelson himself always denied intentionally stalling the patent application process, and asserted that he attempted for many years to get companies interested in his ideas, only to be rejected by what he termed the &quot;not invented here&quot; response. Indeed, although Lemelson died in 1997, uncontested patents he had applied for were still being issued as late as 2005-2006, such as his patent titled &quot;Superconducting electrical cable&quot; () which was applied for in May 1995, but only issued in October 2005.

As a result of such cases, US lawmakers were urged to revise patent law to constrain inventors who emerge after an extended period of time demanding large licensing fees. Under current US law (35 U.S.C. 122 and 37 C.F.R. 1.211), revised by Congress in 1999, most patent applications are published 18 months after being received and any resulting patents expire 20 years after the filing date, serving to limit surprise or &quot;submarine&quot; patents. Lemelson&#x27;s applications were submitted under older rules, which kept the application confidential during patent prosecution.

==Controversy==


The sharpest criticism of Lemelson is that he engaged in unfair &quot;submarine&quot; patent filings. Such filings are said to piggyback new patents onto applications filed years, even decades, earlier. When the technology in question comes into widespread use, the older patent claim surfaces again and the applicant seeks large fees to license the patent(s) in question.

==Honors==
Lemelson, named Engineer of the Year by readers of &quot;Design News&quot; in 1995, made many millions in uncontested licenses with a number of the world&#x27;s most successful companies including IBM and Sony, among others. In 1995, Lemelson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. On Thomas Edison&#x27;s birthday in 1998, the John Templeton Foundation, which recognizes &quot;the incalculable power of the human mind,&quot; made a posthumous award.

==Lemelson Foundation==
The Lemelson Foundation is a private IRC 501(c)(3) philanthropic organization founded in 1993 by Jerome Lemelson and his wife Dorothy.&quot;

<text>The Sacagawea River is a tributary of the Musselshell River, approximately 30 mi (48 km) long, in north-central Montana in the United States. It rises on the plains of northern Fergus County and flows eastward. The river formerly joined the Musselshell five miles above the confluence of the Musselshell with the Missouri, but it now flows into the arm of Fort Peck Lake on the Missouri formed by the mouth of the Musselshell.

==History==
The river was explored during the Lewis and Clark Expedition and named after their guide, Sacagawea. The river was named after her because she was in a canoe, and got caught in a storm. The canoe nearly tipped over, the expedition members were trying to balance the boat, but Sacajawea collected all the books, records, and instruments from the journey. They may have been covered in some material which prevented water damage. The river was named after her for this deed.

==Variant names==
The Sacagawea River has also been known as: Bird Womans River, Birdwoman&#x27;s River, Crooked Creek, Sah cah ger we-ah River, Sah-ca-gee-me-ah River, Sahcagahwea River.

<doc id="533958" wikidata="Q7892394" url="?curid=533958" title="United States congressional subcommittee">
<text>A congressional subcommittee in the United States Congress is a subdivision of a United States congressional committee that considers specified matters and reports back to the full committee.

Subcommittees are formed by most committees to share specific tasks within the jurisdiction of the full committee. Subcommittees are responsible to, and work within the guidelines established by, their parent committees. In particular, standing committees usually create subcommittees with legislative jurisdiction to consider and report bills. They may assign their subcommittees such specific tasks as the initial consideration of measures and oversight of laws and programs in the subcommittees’ areas. Service on subcommittees enables members to develop expertise in specialized fields. Subcommittees diffuse the legislative process. For the most part, they are independent, autonomous units with written jurisdictions, and, pursuant to longstanding practice, most bills are referred by a full committee to them.

General requirements for establishing subcommittees are established in House or Senate rules, but specifics with respect to subcommittee assignments and their jurisdiction are left up to the parent committees. Committees have wide latitude to increase or decrease the number of subcommittees from one congress to the next, including renaming or reassigning jurisdiction among previous subcommittees. Some committees, like the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, often retain a predictable subcommittee structure from year to year, due to the set duties of each subcommittee in drafting annual spending bills. However, even these committees are not immune to organizational changes. New subcommittees on Homeland Security were created in 2003 to handle funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and underwent a joint reorganization during the 110th Congress to better coordinate annual appropriations between the House and Senate.

The respective party conferences in both the House and Senate also provide their own rules, traditions, and precedents with respect to the subcommittee assignments, chairmanship of subcommittees, and even the number of subcommittees members can serve on.

==House subcommittees==
House Rule XI states: the &quot;Rules of the House are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable...&quot; According to clause 1(a)(2) of the same rule, &quot;each subcommittee of a committee is a part of that committee, and is subject to the authority and direction of that committee and to its rules, so far as applicable.&quot;

Subcommittee sizes and party ratios are determined by the full committee, usually in concert with the party leadership. Although negotiations are often held with the minority, these prerogatives remain with the majority. Generally, subcommittee ratios reflect the same ratio as that of a full committee, which in turn reflects the ratio of majority to minority members in the full House. Discussions on subcommittee sizes and ratios traditionally begin soon after the November election, and often are completed by the convening of the early organization meetings, usually held in November or December. Final decisions are made after committee assignments are ratified on the House floor. Seat changes within a Congress can necessitate adjusting subcommittee sizes and ratios.

House Rule X, which provides for the creation of standing committees, limits committees to five subcommittees each, though committees that also have an oversight subcommittee are permitted six subcommittees. Several committees are allowed to exceed this limit, due to the detailed nature of their jurisdiction. The Armed Services and Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Government Reform committees each have seven subcommittees, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is allowed six subcommittees, without also requiring an oversight subcommittee, and the Appropriations Committee has twelve subcommittees plus a select oversight panel on intelligence. House rules also prohibit any full committee from establishing subunits that last longer than six months. If they do, then the new subunit counts against the subcommittee limit.

Subcommittee jurisdictions are not enumerated in the House rules, and are determined by each committee. Several committees establish specific subcommittee jurisdictions in committee rules. Pursuant to the jurisdiction of the full committee, most legislation is referred by the committee to a subcommittee prior to consideration by the full committee. However, some committees retain specific legislation at the full-committee level. For example, the Ways and Means Committee keeps legislation amending the income tax sections of the Internal Revenue Code at full committee, and the Natural Resources Committee retains matters relating to Native Americans for the full committee.

House Rules further require that every full committee with more than 20 members must establish a subcommittee on oversight, though this requirement does not limit the ability of the full committee or its other subcommittees to exercise oversight over programs and agencies under their jurisdiction.

===Service on subcommittees===
House rules are silent on how members are assigned to subcommittees, as this practice is traditionally governed by party rules and practices.

House Rule X generally restricts members of Congress to service on no more than two standing committees and no more than four subcommittees within each of those committees, with some exceptions. For example, the chairman and ranking member of the full committee are allowed to serve &quot;ex officio&quot; on their subcommittees without that service being subject to the limitation. Also, service on any temporary investigative subcommittees established by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct does not count. Finally, representatives can request waivers from their respective party caucus or conference to serve on additional committees or subcommittees

===House Democratic Caucus===
Democratic Caucus Rule 26, which addresses subcommittees “when the Democratic party is the majority,” states that no subcommittee can be more than 60% of the size of a full committee. It further states that the resident commissioner and delegates should not be counted in determining subcommittee (or committee) size.

House Democrats allow each committee member to bid, in order of seniority, for available subcommittee leadership slots. For all committees, except Appropriations, this is done by full-committee seniority; for Appropriations, it is done by subcommittee seniority. Caucus rules generally limit Members to chair only one full committee or one subcommittee with legislative jurisdiction. Subcommittee leaders selected for the Appropriations Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ways and Means Committee require Democratic Steering and Policy Committee approval.

===House Republican Conference===
Republican Conference rules are silent on subcommittee size and ratio issues. Each committee chair determines and provides to other Republican members of the committee the method for selecting subcommittee chairs. However, a majority of the Republican Members of the full committee can disapprove the selection procedure. Republican Conference rules changes for the 108th Congress required subcommittee chairs of the Appropriations Committee to receive full conference approval. Under House rules, subcommittee chairs are limited to six years of service. Republicans also limit members to a single committee or subcommittee chairmanship; the chairmanships of the Standards of Official Conduct Committee and the House Administration Committee are exempt, thereby allowing a Member to chair either of these panels and an additional panel. Finally, Republican Conference rules prohibit a full-committee chair from leading a subcommittee of the committee they head. Republicans generally leave assignment decisions to the committee leader to determine, although most employ a bidding approach that allows members to select subcommittee slots. Chairmen are limited to six years as the ranking member on a committee, with time spent as chairman and as ranking minority member counting towards the limit. Since the rule has come into force in 1995, waivers have been granted, though very rarely.

==Senate subcommittees==
Given the smaller size of the senate, there are fewer members competing for committee and subcommittee assignments. The Standing Rules of the Senate do not establish any limits on the number of subcommittees a standing or select committee may establish, and gives more latitude to the committees in determining their subcommittee organization and membership. The Senate prohibits committees from creating any subunit other than a subcommittee, unless authorized by specific resolution approved by the full Senate.

=== Service on subcommittees ===
Senate rules do place some limits on subcommittees. The Senate classifies its committees into three categories, known as A, B, or C committees. Senate Rule 25 restricts all senators to service on no more than three committees, two A committees and one B or C Committee. Party rules further restrict assignments to no more than one among the so-called &quot;Super A&quot; Committees of Appropriations, Armed Services, Finance, and Foreign Relations.

Senators are limited to service on no more than three subcommittees on each of the A Committees they serve on, and no more than two subcommittees from B or C Committees. The chairman and ranking member of full committees are permitted to serve &quot;ex officio&quot; on any of their committee&#x27;s subcommittees.

Senators are further restricted by Rule 25 to chair no more than one subcommittee on each of the full committees they are a member of. There are additional restrictions for a chairman of an A Committee. The chairmen is limited to chair only one subcommittee on each A Committee they serve on. This restriction even extends to committees they don&#x27;t chair. 

Chairmen of Class B or C committees are prohibited from serving as chair of any subcommittee of any committee they chair, and are similarly restricted to serving as chair of only one Class A subcommittee.

=== Senate Democratic Caucus ===
Senate Democratic Caucus rules are not publicly available, so it is hard to determine how those rules apply to subcommittee assignments. However, unlike their Republican counterparts, Democratic chairmen and ranking members are not limited to six-year terms nor are chairmen of full committees prohibited from serving as chairmen of their own committee&#x27;s subcommittees.

=== Senate Republican Conference ===
Republican Conference rules place additional restrictions on senators, including term limits of 6 years as a committee chairman plus 6 years as ranking member.

* A chair/ranking member of an A committee may not serve as chair/ranking member of any subcommittees. Appropriations subcommittee chairmanships are exempt.
* A chair/ranking member of a non-A committee, excluding Ethics, may not serve as chair/ranking member of more than one subcommittee. Appropriations subcommittee chairmanships are not exempt.
* The chair/vice chair of the Ethics Committee may serve on no more than two standing subcommittees.
* A Senator may not serve as chair/ranking member of more than two subcommittees.
* A Senator shall not serve more than 6 years as chair of any standing committee, effective January 1997, plus 6 years as ranking member of a committee. Once a Senator served 6 years chairing a committee, the term would be over. However, if a Senator served 6 years as a ranking minority member, the Senator could serve as chair if the party controls the chamber.

<doc id="533960" wikidata="Q5029874" url="?curid=533960" title="Canadian Coast Guard College">
<text>The Canadian Coast Guard College (CCGC) is a maritime training college and Canadian Coast Guard facility located in Westmount, Nova Scotia—a suburb of the former city of Sydney in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.

The CCGC core training program revolves around a 4-year Officer Cadet program that prepares navigation and engineering officers for service on Canadian Coast Guard ships. These cadets receive a Bachelor of Technology (Nautical Science) that is granted in collaboration with Cape Breton University. CCGC graduates work in the Canadian Coast Guard fleet as junior officers. Some graduates turn to land-based maritime offices as they advance in their careers.

Other training programs include a 6-month program for Marine Communications and Traffic Services Officers that specializes in radiotelephony procedures for marine safety and vessel traffic services to co-ordinate and monitor vessel movements in Canada&#x27;s territorial waters. Canadian Coast Guard officers that work in the nation&#x27;s Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCCs) also undertake advanced training at CCGC where a mock-up of a JRCC exists for simulation and training purposes. Additionally, various courses and training programs exist for specialized positions in CCG, including administrative courses, search and rescue, and environmental response.
==History==

Established in 1965 as a residential college on the site of the former navy base located at Point Edward along the western shore of Sydney Harbour, CCGC&#x27;s first mandate was to train young men in 4-year diplomas of Marine Engineering or Marine Navigation for the Coast Guard&#x27;s Officer Training Program. The Officer Training Program expanded in 1973 to include women.

In 1981, CCGC moved from its location on the former Point Edward naval base to an adjacent custom-built 120 acre (486,000 m²) campus in neighbouring Westmount. The campus, designed by Nova Scotia Architect Keith L. Graham is located in a wooded area immediately south of Point Edward and adjacent to Petersfield Provincial Park. It consists of a variety of interlinked residential, training, administration, and health/fitness facilities. CCGC also has simulators for depicting the navigation of vessels in a variety of scenarios, dry-land mock-ups of vessel engine rooms, and a simulator for a rescue coordination centre (RCC).

CCGC has a small fleet of training vessels ranging from sail boats and rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB) and one motor life boat - all housed in a custom-built boathouse on the college&#x27;s waterfront along a small cove.

From the 1980s to the 2000s (decade), the college expanded its training programs to include customized marine training for students from Commonwealth Caribbean nations, as well as other federal government agencies such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and the Department of Transport.

In the 1995, the 4 year Officer Training Program was granted degree accreditation through an agreement with the University College of Cape Breton, since renamed Cape Breton University. Following completion of the Officer Training program, graduates now receive a Bachelor of Technology (Nautical Science or nautical engineering) from CBU.

==Training programs==

Following training programs are offered:

* Officer Training Program (OTP)
** Marine Navigation
** Marine Engineering
* Marine Communications and Traffic Services (MCTS) Officer Program

== Admissions ==
Cadets are typically selected from Canadian high school graduates with a 70% average or higher including grade 12 physics, advanced math, and English (or French). Cadets applying for the engineering program must also have grade 11 chemistry. Once admitted, cadets hired into the Officer Training Program are indeterminate employees, civil servantsof the Federal Government, receiving a monthly allowance of $800 (as of December 31, 2023) with an additional allowance while on sea phase of $1551.81 - $2205.85. The cost of tuition is paid by the Canadian government.

<text>A select committee in the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy is a committee made up of a small number of parliamentary members appointed to deal with particular areas or issues.

==Description==
A select committee is a special subcommittee of a legislature or assembly. Select committees exist in the British Parliament, as well as in other parliaments based on the Westminster model, such as those in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand.

They are often investigative in nature, collecting data or evidence for a law or problem, and dissolve after their findings have been reported.

These are very common in government legislatures, and are used to solve special problems, hence their name.

==By country==

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, select committees work in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

===Australia===

There are select committees appointed by both the Australian Senate and the Australian House of Representatives.

===India===
Under Rule 125 of the Rajya Sabha Rules and Procedures, any member may move as an amendment that a bill be referred to a select committee and, if the motion is carried, the bill shall be referred to such a committee. The House decides the members of such committee.

===Ireland===
===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, there are special committees of the Dewan Rakyat (House of Reps) and the Dewan Negara (Senate).

===New Zealand===
===South Africa===

In South Africa, select committees appointed by the National Council of Provinces (the upper house) follow the work of the various national departments as well as dealing with Bills.

===Sri Lanka===
Parliament will appoint ad-hoc committees to inquire into and report to the House on a particular matter.

<text>A select or special committee of the United States Congress is a congressional committee appointed to perform a special function that is beyond the authority or capacity of a standing committee. A select committee is usually created by a resolution that outlines its duties and powers and the procedures for appointing members. Select and special committees are often investigative, rather than legislative, in nature though some select and special committees have the authority to draft and report legislation.

A select committee generally expires on completion of its designated duties, though it can be renewed. Several select committees are treated as standing committees by House and Senate rules and are permanent fixtures in both bodies, continuing from one Congress to the next. Examples include the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the House and the Select Committee on Intelligence in the Senate. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee is a select committee, though the word &quot;select&quot; is no longer a part of its name.

Some select committees are called &quot;special committees&quot;, such as the Senate Special Committee on Aging. However, they do not differ in any substantive way from the others.

Prior to the advent of permanent standing committees in the early 19th century, the House of Representatives relied almost exclusively on select committees to carry out much of its legislative work. The committee system has grown and evolved over the years. During the earliest Congresses, select committees, created to perform a specific function and terminated when the task was completed, performed the overwhelming majority of the committee work. The first committee to be established by Congress was on April 2, 1789, during the First Congress. It was a select committee assigned to prepare and report standing rules and orders for House proceedings and it lasted just five days, dissolving after submitting its report to the full House. Since that time, Congress has always relied on committees as a means to accomplish its work.

==Early select committees==
In the 1st Congress (1789–1791), the House appointed roughly six hundred select committees over the course of two years. By the 3rd Congress (1793–95), Congress had three permanent standing committees, the House Committee on Elections, the House Committee on Claims, and the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills, but more than three hundred fifty select committees. While the modern committee system is now firmly established in both House and Senate procedure, with the rules of each House establishing a full range of permanent standing committees and assigning jurisdiction of all legislative issues among them, select committees continue to be used to respond to unique and difficult issues as the need arises.

The United States Senate did not establish its first standing committees until 1816, so select committees performed the overwhelming majority of the committee work for the Senate during the earliest Congresses. Like the House, standing committees have largely replaced select committees in the modern Senate, but select committees continue to be appointed from time to time.

Early select committees were fluid, serving their established function and then going out of existence. This makes tracking committees difficult, since many committees were known by the date they were created or by a petition or other document that had been referred to them. In a number of instances, the official journal and other congressional publications did not consistently refer to an individual committee by the same title. Though such inconsistencies still appeared during the 20th century, they were less frequent.

==Notable select committees==
While earlier select committees often narrowly tailored to specific issues, some select committees ultimately had a noticeable impact on federal legislation and American history. One was the select committee dealing with Missouri&#x27;s admission to the Union as a new state. The committee was established in 1821 and lasted just 7 days. Chaired by Henry Clay, the committee helped draft the Missouri Compromise, which attempted to resolve the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states.

Some select committees went on to become permanent standing committees. The most notable of these is the Ways and Means Committee. It was first established as a select committee July 24, 1789 during a debate on the creation of the Treasury Department. Representatives had concerns over giving the new department too much authority over revenue proposals, so the House felt it would be better equipped if it established a committee to handle the matter. This first Committee on Ways and Means had 11 members and existed for just two months. In 1801, it became a standing committee, and still operates as one today.

==In the 20th century==
Notable select and special committees established in the 20th century include:

*House Special Committee on Un-American Activities Authorized to Investigate Nazi Propaganda and Certain Other Propaganda Activities (McCormack-Dickstein Committee): established in 1934 &quot;in reaction to the overthrow of a number of established foreign Governments in favor of communist or fascist systems and reflected concern that foreign propaganda might subvert the U.S. Constitution&quot;, the committee&#x27;s chairman was John W. McCormack of Massachusetts and its vice chairman was Samuel Dickstein of New York. The committee is sometimes cited as a forerunner to the House Un-American Activities Committee.
*Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (Truman Committee): chaired by Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, this committee, established on March 1, 1941, by the unanimous consent of the Senate, allowed Truman to rise to national prominence. The committee investigated waste and corruption that hampered U.S. military efforts before and during World War II; it &quot;held hundreds of hearings, traveled thousands of miles to conduct field inspections, and saved millions of dollars in cost overruns&quot;. The committee disbanded on January 28, 1948, and its functions were assumed by what became the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
*Senate Temporary Select Committee to Study the Senate Committee System (Stevenson Committee): chaired by Senator Adlai E. Stevenson III of Illinois, the recommendations of this Committee led to the abolition of most of the Senate&#x27;s select and joint committees, and the reshuffling to jurisdictional lines of Senate committees. The 1970s reorganization was the last major reorganization of the Senate committee system.
*House Select Committee on Assassinations to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. from 1976 to 1978.
*Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (Watergate Committee): chaired by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, this committee investigated misconduct during the 1972 presidential election, most famously the Watergate scandal. The committee disbanded after completing its investigation in June 1974.
*House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran (Iran–Contra Committee): established in 1987 to investigate the Iran–Contra scandal.

==In the 21st century==
===House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming===
The Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming was established in 2007 in the 110th Congress (under Speaker Nancy Pelosi) and renewed for the 111th Congress. The committee was advisory in nature, and lacked the legislative authority granted to standing committees. The committee was chaired by Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts, co-author of the unsuccessful 2009 cap-and-trade legislation (Waxman-Markey) supported by Democrats.

The committee held 80 hearings and briefings on issues such as climate change and the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill. The committee played a role in the creation of the 2007 energy bill, the 2009 stimulus package (which contained funds for energy efficiency and other environmental provisions), and the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill (which was passed by the House, but never acted upon by the Senate).

The committee was disbanded by the House in 2011, at the beginning of the 112th Congress, after Republicans took control of the chamber following the 2010 elections.

===House Select Committee on Benghazi===
In May 2014, the House of Representatives voted to create the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi to investigate the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. The committee spent more than $7.8 million on its investigation over two and a half years, issued its final report in December 2016, and shut down at the conclusion of the 114th Congress. The committee was &quot;one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history&quot;, lasting longer than the congressional inquiries into 9/11, Watergate, the assassination of President Kennedy, and the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Democrats and critics viewed the inquiry as intended to damage the presidential prospects of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy prompted controversy when he suggested that Republicans had succeeded with the Benghazi special committee in bringing down Clinton&#x27;s poll numbers. James Fallows wrote that the committee was an &quot;oppo-research arm of the Republican National Committee, far more interested in whatever it might dig up about or against ... Clinton than any remaining mysteries on the four Americans killed in Benghazi&quot;. The committee&#x27;s &quot;most significant, if inadvertent, discovery&quot; was Clinton&#x27;s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which prompted an FBI investigation.

The committee&#x27;s final report found no evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Clinton, but did criticize Defense Department, Central Intelligence Agency and State Department officials for security lapses. In a dissenting report, Democrats accused the committee and its chairman, Trey Gowdy, &quot;of flagrant political bias while arguing the investigation wasted taxpayer money to try to damage Clinton&quot;.

===House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol===
On July 1, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi created a select committee to investigate the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, following the U.S. Senate&#x27;s failure to overcome a Republican-led filibuster to create a bipartisan January 6 Commission. Bipartisan membership on the committee was a point of significant political contention. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger were the only two House Republicans to serve on the committee, and the Republican National Committee eventually censured them for their participation.

===Proposed select committees===
There have been a number of unsuccessful proposals to create select committees. For example, in 2017, Representative Mike Thompson and 162 other Democratic members of Congress unsuccessfully introduced a measure to create a House Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention to address gun violence in the United States. In the same year, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware and Republican Senator Cory Gardner introduced bipartisan legislation to create a Select Committee on Cybersecurity.

The United States House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government was established on January 10, 2023 to fulfill promises made during negotiations for election of the House Speaker by Kevin McCarthy to investigate the Biden Administration&#x27;s alleged weaponization of the federal government.

<text>A joint committee is a committee made up of members of the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. In other contexts, it refers to a committee with members from more than one organization.

==Germany==

A joint committee (&quot;Gemeinsamer Ausschuss&quot;) comprises both members of Bundestag (two thirds) and representatives of the &quot;Länder&quot; (one third). It exists to ensure a working legislature during a state of defense.

A mediation committee (&quot;Vermittlungsausschuss&quot;), consisting in equal numbers of members of Bundestag and representatives of the states, facilitates compromises between Bundestag and Bundesrat in legislation - especially if the consent of Bundesrat is constitutionally required.

==India==
In India, a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) is one type of ad hoc Parliamentary committee constituted by the Indian parliament. A Joint Parliamentary Committee is formed when a motion is adopted by one house and it is supported or agreed by the other house.

==Philippines==
A bicameral conference committee is formed for each bill where the Senate and the House of Representatives have conflicting versions. The committee has the same number of members from each chamber. Once passed, the chambers then have to approve the version passed by the bicameral conference committee in order for it to be sent for the president&#x27;s signature.

If Congress is short on time, a chamber may approve the other chamber&#x27;s version instead.

==Republic of Ireland==

A Joint Committee of the Irish Oireachtas (parliament) comprises members of both Dáil Éireann (the lower house) and Seanad Éireann (the upper house).

==United Kingdom==

A Joint committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is a parliamentary committee consisting of members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Joint Committees can be permanent or temporary. Three permanent committees meet on a regular basis to consider Human Rights, National Security Strategy and Statutory Instruments. A Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, which was first appointed in 1894, considers all bills that seek to consolidate existing statutes. In a similar way, a Joint Committee on Tax Law Rewrite Bills scrutinizes all bills that seek to simplify tax laws. Temporary committees have considered specific topics ranging from draft bills on financial services and climate change to restoration of the Palace of Westminster. There are two statutory committees that have members from both Houses, the Ecclesiastical Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee.

==United States==

A Joint Committee of the United States Congress is a congressional committee consisting of both Senate and House members and having jurisdiction over matters of joint interest. An example of a joint committee is the Joint Committee on the Library. Most joint committees are permanent (as with the Library Committee) but temporary joint committees have been created to address specific issues (such as the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War during the American Civil War).

Joint committees are also a feature for upper and lower houses of State legislatures in some States.

<text>The English Standard Version (ESV) is a translation of the Bible in contemporary English. Published in 2001 by Crossway, the ESV was &quot;created by a team of more than 100 leading evangelical scholars and pastors.&quot; The ESV relies on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.

Crossway says that the ESV continues a legacy of precision and faithfulness in translating the original text into English. It describes the ESV as a translation that adheres to an &quot;essentially literal&quot; translation philosophy, taking into account &quot;differences in grammar, syntax, and idiom between current literary English and the original languages.&quot; It also describes the ESV as a translation that &quot;emphasizes &#x27;word-for-word&#x27; accuracy, literary excellence, and depth of meaning.&quot;

Since its official publication, the ESV has received endorsement from numerous evangelical pastors and theologians, including John Piper and R. C. Sproul.

== History ==
=== Pre-publication ===
During the early 1990s, Crossway president Lane T. Dennis engaged in discussions with various Christian scholars and pastors regarding the need for a new literal translation of the Bible. In 1997, Dennis contacted the National Council of Churches (NCC) and proceeded to enter negotiations, alongside Trinity Evangelical Divinity School professor Wayne Grudem, to obtain rights to use the 1971 text edition of the Revised Standard Version (RSV) as the starting point for a new translation. In September 1998, an agreement was reached with the NCC for Crossway to use and modify the 1971 RSV text, thereby enabling the creation of a new translation. Crossway moved forward from this position by forming a translation committee and initiating work on the English Standard Version. Crossway officially published the ESV in September 2001. The first ESV print edition to be released was the &quot;ESV Classic Reference Bible&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;World&quot; reported of &quot;feminists&quot; noticing links between Crossway and the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW). Members of the CBMW had earlier been involved in criticizing plans made by Zondervan&#x27;s New International Version (NIV) translation committee to publish a gender-neutral edition of the NIV. Grudem, who was president of the CBMW at the time, responded by stating, &quot;This [translation] is not a CBMW project.&quot;

=== Translation Oversight Committee ===
Chaired by Dennis, the fourteen-member Translation Oversight Committee was aided by more than fifty biblical experts serving as review scholars. The translation committee also received input from the Advisory Council, having more than fifty members. J. I. Packer served as general editor of the translation, and Leland Ryken served as literary stylist. Grudem states that the NET Bible study notes were one resource that the translation committee consulted during the translation process. He also states that the translation committee meets approximately every 5–7 years to consider text revisions.

The original translation committee featured the following notable individuals:

* Wayne A. Grudem (Research Professor, Theology and Biblical Studies, Phoenix Seminary)
* William D. Mounce (Professor of New Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)
* J. I. Packer (Board of Governors Professor of Theology, Regent College, Vancouver, Canada)
* Vern Sheridan Poythress (Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Westminster Theological Seminary; Editor, &quot;Westminster Theological Journal&quot;)
* Gordon Wenham (Old Testament Tutor at Trinity College, Bristol; Emeritus Professor of Old Testament, University of Gloucestershire)

By 2011, Robert H. Mounce and William (Bill) Mounce had become emeritus members. Having served as the ESV New Testament Chair, Bill Mounce&#x27;s role was assigned to Vern Poythress. Writing on his personal blog in 2009, Mounce described his relationship to the ESV, having accepted a position on the NIV translation committee:

By late 2023, Paul R. House, J. I. Packer, Leland Ryken, Gordon Wenham, and Bruce Winter had retired from the translation committee. In addition, the following individuals had joined by this time:

* Josh Dennis (CEO and President, Crossway)
* Dane Ortlund (Senior Pastor, Naperville Presbyterian Church)
* Jon Dennis (Senior Pastor, Holy Trinity Church in Chicago)
* Justin Taylor (Book Publisher, Crossway)
* Don Jones (Chief Publishing Officer, Bible Publisher, Crossway)
* Douglas O&#x27;Donnell (Senior Vice President of Bible Publishing, Crossway)
* Kevin DeYoung (Senior Pastor, Christ Covenant Church)

=== Post-publication ===
In 2008, Crossway published the &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot;, which would go on to sell more than one million copies. In 2009, the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA) named the &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot; as Christian Book of the Year. This was the first time in the award&#x27;s 30-year history to be given to a study Bible. By September 2024, the &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot; had sold more than 2.5 million copies.
In 2011, Crossway published a special limited edition &quot;ESV New Classic Reference Bible&quot; to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the King James Version (KJV) first being published. Having a foreword by Leland Ryken, it features a selection of artwork created by Makoto Fujimura for &quot;The Four Holy Gospels&quot;, a separate edition produced to match the size of the original KJV printing.

Crossway, which operates as a not-for-profit, states that most ESV copies are &quot;given away freely through ministry partners around the world.&quot; According to Crossway, the total number of printed ESV Bibles that have been distributed since 2001 are as follows:

* 2015: 100 million
* 2021: 250 million
* 2023: 290 million
* 2024: 300 million
* 2025: 315 million

In October 2024, the ESV was the number one selling Bible translation on the ECPA Bible Translations Bestsellers monthly chart. This was the first time the ESV had reached number one in the chart&#x27;s history (which began in December 2011), and the first time the NIV had lost its number one spot in five years.

==== Debate surrounding translation philosophy ====
At the 2008 annual meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society, Mark L. Strauss presented a paper titled &quot;Why the English Standard Version should not become the Standard English Version: How to make a good translation much better.&quot; In the paper, Strauss criticizes the ESV for using dated language, among other perceived issues, such as using gender-neutral language inconsistently in translation. ESV translator Bill Mounce responded to Strauss&#x27;s criticism:

Strauss invited Mounce to engage further through participation at the following annual meeting. In 2009, Mounce presented his formal response paper titled &quot;Can the ESV and TNIV Co-Exist in the Same Universe?&quot; In the paper, Mounce describes various points regarding his view of the need for both formal and functional translations.

In October 2019, University of Oklahoma sociology professor Samuel L. Perry published a journal article titled &quot;The Bible as a Product of Cultural Power: The Case of Gender Ideology in the English Standard Version.&quot; In the article, Perry attempts to demonstrate &quot;how a more critical approach toward &#x27;the Bible&#x27; can provide richer, more sophisticated sociological analyses of power and cultural reproduction within Christian traditions.&quot; Perry argues that Crossway&#x27;s ESV translation committee made &quot;intentional, systematic changes&quot; into the ESV for the purpose of being able to &quot;publish and mass-market a text more amenable to conservative, complementarian interpretations.&quot; Perry further argues that the ESV translation committee &quot;have engaged in more covert means of cultural reproduction, not only disseminating &quot;their interpretation&quot; of the biblical text, but manipulating the &quot;text itself&quot;.&quot; The &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot; often details in its study notes why a complementarian interpretation of the original text may have been rendered in translation.

In 2020, the Ireland-based Association of Catholic Priests, an independent and voluntary association of Catholic clergy, criticized the ESV for its position on the use of gender-neutral language, perceiving the use of terms such as &quot;mankind&quot; and &quot;brothers&quot; to be &quot;out of sync with modern usage [and] culturally regarded as diminishing and disrespectful of women.&quot;

In June 2021, Samuel L. Perry published a journal article titled &quot;Whitewashing Evangelical Scripture: The Case of Slavery and Antisemitism in the English Standard Version.&quot; In the article, Perry attempts to demonstrate how &quot;the ESV editors, while modifying certain RSV renderings to establish transitivity for their text among complementarian/biblicist Christians, sought to establish intransitivity between the text and more pejorative social interpretations by progressively re-translating lexically ambiguous terms and introducing footnotes to obviate the Bible&#x27;s ostensible promotion of slavery and antisemitism.&quot; In turn, Perry was interviewed by &quot;Salon&quot; regarding the content of the article. Boyce College Professor of Biblical Studies Denny Burk points out that Perry makes &quot;a significant error&quot; in referring to Grudem as the general editor of the ESV. In July 2021, &quot;Bible Study Magazine&quot; editor Mark Ward published an article to his personal blog in response:

==== One Million Bibles Initiative ====
In November 2022, Crossway began an effort to fund and distribute 1 million ESV Bibles throughout English-speaking regions in the Global South, with a primary focus on Africa and Asia. Having been designed on a funding model where Bibles produced at cost are either donated or strategically subsidized, the project was initiated to resource Christians and pastors in low-income communities with study Bibles and various other editions, aiming to prevent &quot;biblical illiteracy, spiritual malnourishment, and the transmission of false teaching run rampant.&quot;

Crossway states that its ministry partners were in the process of distributing more than 435,000 Bibles by the end of 2023, increasing to 656,000 Bibles by the end of 2024. The project reached funding for all 1 million Bibles by the end of December 2024.

== Literary attributes ==

=== Relationship to the Revised Standard Version ===
The ESV is derived from the 1971 text edition of the Revised Standard Version. ESV translation committee member Wayne Grudem states that approximately eight percent (or about 60,000 words) of the 1971 RSV text being used for the ESV was revised as of first publication in 2001. Grudem also states that the committee removed &quot;every trace of liberal influence that had caused such criticism from evangelicals when the RSV was first published in 1952.&quot; Although, Grudem also states that much of the 1971 RSV text left unchanged by the committee &quot;is simply &#x27;the best of the best&#x27; of the KJV tradition.&quot;

=== Style ===
Theologian Tim Challies has praised the ESV for its commitment to literary excellence:

Crossway states that the ESV &quot;retains theological terminology—words such as grace, faith, justification, sanctification, redemption, regeneration, reconciliation, propitiation—because of their central importance for Christian doctrine and also because the underlying Greek words were already becoming key words and technical terms among Christians in New Testament times.&quot; It also states that the ESV seeks to let the distinct writing style of each biblical writer come through the translated text.

=== Position on gender-neutral language ===
The ESV translation committee states that &quot;the goal of the ESV is to render literally what is in the original.&quot; The committee expands on this position in stating that, although the ESV avoids using gender-neutral language (for the purpose of preserving contextual meaning found in the original text), the translation does utilize gender-neutral language in specific cases. The committee further states that its objective was &quot;transparency to the original text, allowing the reader to understand the original on its own terms rather than in the terms of our present-day Western culture.&quot;

== Revisions and other editions ==

=== 2002 text correction ===
In 2002, Crossway published an unannounced revision to the original 2001 text to make several corrections, these being in areas where it was believed &quot;that a mistake had been made in translation.&quot; This includes a revision in Romans 3:9, changing &quot;under the power of sin&quot; to &quot;under sin.&quot;

=== Anglicized edition ===
In 2002, Collins published the &quot;English Standard Version: Anglicized Edition&quot; in the United Kingdom. It is abbreviated as ESVUK.

=== 2007 text edition ===
Crossway published a revision of the ESV text in 2007 as &quot;ESV Text Edition: 2007.&quot; The revision makes minor changes to the 2002 corrected edition.

=== Oxford Apocrypha edition ===
In 2009, Oxford University Press published the &quot;English Standard Version Bible with Apocrypha&quot;. This edition includes the Apocrypha, placed at the back of the Bible, intended for &quot;denominations that use those books in liturgical readings and for students who need them for historical purposes.&quot;

=== 2011 text edition ===
Crossway published a revision of the ESV text in 2011 as &quot;ESV Text Edition: 2011.&quot; The revision changes fewer than 500 words in total throughout 275 verses from the 2007 text. The changes were made in each case to &quot;correct grammar, improve consistency, or increase precision in meaning.&quot; A notable revision was made in Isaiah 53:5, changing &quot;wounded for our transgressions&quot; to &quot;pierced for our transgressions&quot; in the revised text. In addition, the ESV translation committee decided to modify the use of the word &quot;slave&quot; (being the Greek word &quot;doulos&quot;) on a case by case basis throughout the New Testament, being retranslated to either &quot;bondservant&quot; or &quot;servant&quot; to disambiguate the context of the situation.

=== Gideons edition ===
In 2013, Gideons International permanently transitioned from the New King James Version to the ESV as their translation of choice for free of charge distribution Bibles. In addition to being granted licensing for the ESV text (for the purpose of distribution), Crossway gave Gideons International permission to modify the text to use alternative readings based on the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. The Gideons edition uses more than 50 alternative readings.

=== 2016 text edition ===
Crossway published a revision of the ESV text in 2016 as the &quot;ESV Permanent Text Edition (2016).&quot; The revision changes 52 words in total throughout 29 verses from the 2011 text. In addition, it also features an update of the textual basis for both the Old Testament and New Testament. A notable revision was made in Genesis 3:16 to use a complementarian interpretation of the original text: switching &quot;shall be toward&quot; with &quot;shall be contrary to&quot; in the revised text. The previous rendering can be found in the footnotes (excluding any editions that specifically do not have footnotes, such as the &quot;ESV Reader&#x27;s Bible&quot;). The &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot; details in its study notes the revised interpretation in relation to a parallel understanding of 3:16 with both 4:7 (which shares the Hebrew word &quot;teshuqah&quot;; this verse having also been updated in the 2016 text) and Ephesians 5:21–32.

Coinciding with the release of the revision, Crossway announced that &quot;the text of the ESV Bible will remain unchanged in all future editions printed and published by Crossway.&quot; However, in a statement from Lane T. Dennis the following month, the new policy was abandoned &quot;to allow for ongoing periodic updating of the text to reflect the realities of biblical scholarship such as textual discoveries or changes in English over time.&quot; In the statement, Dennis responded to public discourse surrounding the policy: &quot;We have become convinced that this decision was a mistake. We apologize for this and for any concern this has caused for readers of the ESV.&quot; The revision was subsequently republished as &quot;ESV Text Edition: 2016.&quot;

=== Catholic edition ===
In 2018, the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India published the ESV Catholic Edition (ESV-CE), which includes the deuterocanonical books in Catholic canonical order. With permission from Crossway, a team of Catholic scholars reviewed the text of the ESV in light of the Vatican&#x27;s translation principles as set forth in &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot;, making approved modifications where needed to adhere to Catholic teaching.

In 2019, the Augustine Institute published the ESV-CE in North America as &quot;The Augustine Bible&quot;. In October 2021, following these developments, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge published its own version of the ESV-CE, newly typeset and with anglicized spelling, in multiple formats.

In April 2020, the Catholic Church in India adopted a new English lectionary that uses the ESV-CE as its Bible text (excluding the book of Psalms, where the Grail Psalms translation is used instead). In July 2020, the Bishops&#x27; Conference of Scotland approved the development of a new lectionary using the ESV-CE text. This was followed by the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales receiving the first volume of a new lectionary using the ESV-CE text in November 2020 (which had earlier been approved for development in November 2018). The new lectionary will be fully introduced during Advent 2024, although a revised version of the Grail Psalms, the Abbey Psalms and Canticles, will continue to be used.

After the publication of the 2009 Oxford University Press Apocrypha edition, the Apocrypha text &quot;was subsequently reviewed and approved by members of the ESV Translation Oversight Committee in 2017, including the special cases of Tobit and Esther (with Greek Additions).&quot; In 2019, Anglican Liturgy Press published the &quot;ESV with Apocrypha&quot;. Like the Oxford edition, it places the Apocrypha at the back of the Bible. It was rereleased in 2023 as a bonded leather hardcover edition.

=== 2025 text edition ===
In May 2024, Grudem mentioned that the ESV translation committee was planning to meet in Wheaton, Illinois, in July 2024 to consider approximately 120 suggested changes to the ESV text. He estimated that the committee would approve around 30 to 40 of these suggestions, including &quot;little tweaks to the wording [that] make it consistent with where we&#x27;ve translated the same phrase elsewhere.&quot;

In February 2025, Crossway announced the 2025 text edition of the ESV. The revision changes 68 words in total throughout 42 verses from the 2016 text. In addition, 57 footnotes were revised, and punctuation was revised in 14 verses. A notable revision was made in reverting the 2016 changes to Genesis 3:16 and 4:7, having been switched back to their previous rendering. Another notable revision was made in John 1:18, changing &quot;the only God&quot; to &quot;God the only Son&quot; in the revised text. The 2025 text edition is scheduled to be released in the spring of 2025, aiming to be used in more than 540 print editions by the fall of 2026.

== Use ==
=== Audio Bibles ===

In August 2003, Crossway released its first audio Bible, being the New Testament read by Marquis Laughlin. Shortly after, the New York City-based Fellowship for Performing Arts released an ESV audio Bible read by Max McLean, having been produced by Liz Donato and recorded under a licensing agreement. The first format released was the New Testament as a set of 12 cassette tapes, having been published by Crossway on October 31, 2003, being the 486th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. A set of New Testament CDs was published the following month, and the full audio Bible was published in 2004. The full audio Bible was rereleased in May 2024.

In 2008, Crossway released an audio Bible featuring the voice of David Cochran Heath. This was published on October 31, 2008, being the 491th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation.

In late 2023, Crossway finished releasing six new audio Bibles, having been read by Conrad Mbewe, Kristyn Getty, Ray Ortlund, Jackie Hill Perry, Robert Smith Jr., and Michael Reeves. The entire project took approximately 6,000 hours of production labor. Ortlund called his recording experience &quot;the most exacting, precise, detailed, and demanding task I&#x27;ve performed since my doctoral work 40 years ago,&quot; in addition to being &quot;immensely satisfying.&quot; Ortlund used &quot;The HarperCollins Bible Pronunciation Guide&quot; as a linguistic aid during production.

<doc id="533984" wikidata="Q1040943" url="?curid=533984" title="Carl Vinson">
<text>Carl Vinson (November 18, 1883 – June 1, 1981) was an American politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives for over 50 years and was influential in the 20th century expansion of the U.S. Navy. He was a member of the Democratic Party and represented Georgia in the House from 1914 to 1965. He was known as &quot;The Father of the Two-Ocean Navy&quot;. He is the longest-serving member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Georgia. From 1961 to 1965, he served as the Dean of the US House of Representatives as the longest serving member of the body.

, the third , is named after him.

==Early years==
Vinson was born in Baldwin County, Georgia, where he attended local schools and Georgia Military College. He graduated with a law degree from Mercer University in 1902 and was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order. After some years of practice, he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1908. After losing a third term following redistricting, he was appointed as judge of the Baldwin County court.

Following the sudden death of U.S. Senator Augustus Bacon, Representative Thomas W. Hardwick of Georgia&#x27;s 10th congressional district was nominated to fill Bacon&#x27;s Senate seat. Vinson announced his candidacy for Hardwick&#x27;s seat in Congress. Vinson defeated three opponents. Vinson was the youngest member of Congress (30 years old) when he was sworn in on November 3, 1914.

==Service in Congress==
Vinson served as a Representative from November 3, 1914, to January 3, 1965. He was repeatedly re-elected by Democratic voters for this seat. Vinson&#x27;s first term in congress was characterized by his support for segregation sponsoring bills to establish separate street cars and apartments for Blacks in the District of Columbia, banning interracial marriage in the District, and repealing the Fifteenth Amendment.

During his tenure in the U.S. House, Vinson was a champion for national defense and especially the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps. He joined the House Naval Affairs Committee shortly after World War I and became the ranking Democratic member in the early 1920s. He was the only Democrat appointed to the Morrow Board, which reviewed the status of aviation in America in the mid-1920s.

In 1931, Vinson became chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee. In 1934, Vinson helped push the Vinson–Trammell Act, along with Democratic Senator Park Trammell of Florida. The bill authorized the replacement of obsolete vessels by new construction and a gradual increase of ships within the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and London Naval Treaty of 1930. Initial funding for the Vinson–Trammell Navy Act was provided by the Emergency Appropriations Act of 1934. This was necessary as during the previous administration, not a single major warship was laid down and the US Navy was both aging and losing ground to the Japanese Navy. Japan repudiated the naval treaties in late 1934.

Vinson later was primarily responsible for additional naval expansion legislation, the Naval Act of 1938 (&quot;Second Vinson Act&quot;) and the Third Vinson Act of 1940 (which was essentially a mere prelude to the Two-Oceans Act that followed a month later), as well as the Two-Ocean Navy Act of 1940. The ambitious program called for by this series of laws helped the U.S. Navy as the country entered World War II, as new ships were able to match the latest ships from Japan.

At the end of World War II, Congress had authorized four Naval four-star officers to be promoted to Fleet Admiral. A staunch partisan of Admiral William Halsey, Jr., Vinson blocked the nomination of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance several times, although the majority thought him more deserving, to ensure that Halsey got the fourth billet. Congress eventually responded by passing an unprecedented act that specified that Spruance would remain on a full admiral&#x27;s pay once retired until his death.
Following World War II, the House Naval Affairs Committee was merged with the Military Affairs Committee to become the House Armed Services Committee (this consolidation mirrored the establishment of the Department of Defense when the old Departments of War and of the Navy were consolidated). When the Republicans won control of Congress in the 1946 election, Vinson served as ranking minority member of the committee for two years before becoming chairman in early 1949, when the Democrats were again in majority; a position held for four years until the Republicans briefly returned to the majority for a single congressional term after the 1952 elections. After the Democrats retook congress in the 1954 midterms, Vinson again became chairman, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. In this role, Vinson adopted a committee rule that came to be known as the &quot;Vinson rule&quot;, which limited the number of questions a junior member of the committee could ask to one question per year of service on the committee. As chairman, Vinson oversaw the modernization of the military as its focus shifted to the Cold War. He was also committee chair when Congress authorized the procurement of the first nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, starting with in the late 1950s.

A staunch segregationist, Vinson voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and in 1956, signed &quot;The Southern Manifesto&quot;. Other Southern politicians signed this in resistance to the ruling by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregated public education was unconstitutional, and that states needed to integrate their public schools.

Vinson did not seek re-election in 1964 and retired from Congress in January 1965.

==Personal life==
Vinson married Mary Green of Ohio in 1921. She died in 1949 after a long illness.

Vinson did not have children, but his great-nephew, Sam Nunn, served as a Senator from Georgia for more than 24 years. Nunn followed in his great uncle&#x27;s footsteps, serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee for nearly his entire tenure in the Senate. Sam Nunn&#x27;s daughter, Michelle Nunn, ran unsuccessfully for one of Georgia&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats in 2014.

Vinson considered his longtime assistant Charles Tillman Snead, Jr. his surrogate son, and Snead&#x27;s wife, Molly Staeman Snead, was Vinson&#x27;s wife&#x27;s nurse for 34 years. Snead&#x27;s son and grandchildren maintained this familial bond to Vinson until his death in 1981.

==Death==

Vinson returned to Baldwin County, Georgia, where he lived in retirement until his death on June 1, 1981. He is buried in Memory Hill Cemetery in Milledgeville, Georgia.

At the time of his death, Vinson was the last living member of the House of Representatives who was serving at the time of the United States&#x27; declaration of war against the German Empire, which precipitated the United States&#x27; entry into World War I.

==Legacy ==
In recognition of his efforts on behalf of the U.S. Navy, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was named the , an honor rarely given to a person while living. On March 15, 1980, at age 96, he attended the ship&#x27;s launching.

Vinson Massif, Antarctica&#x27;s highest mountain, is also named after him, together with the related Mount Vinson and Vinson Plateau.

Carl Vinson served 26 consecutive terms in the U.S. House, rarely running against significant opposition. He served for 50 years and one month, a record that stood until 1992, when the mark was surpassed by Jamie Whitten of Mississippi.

For his commitment, Vinson was awarded the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Vinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Special Distinction, the highest award the President can give to a civilian. During his own tenure in the House, Johnson had served for years as a junior member of the House Naval Affairs Committee under Vinson.

The Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs Medical Center in Dublin, Georgia, serving veterans in Central and Southern Georgia, is named for Vinson.

The University of Georgia hosts the Carl Vinson Institute of Government.

Athens, Georgia, is the site of Carl Vinson Park.

Carl Vinson Parkway is located in Warner Robins, Georgia.

Georgia Military College formerly had a barracks named for him. It was razed in the mid-2000s.

Vinson Hall Retirement Community in McLean, Virginia, is named after Carl Vinson.

<doc id="533989" wikidata="Q5030938" url="?curid=533989" title="Canadore College">
<text>Canadore College is a college of applied arts and technology located in North Bay, Ontario, Canada, attended primarily by international students. It was founded in 1967 as a campus of Sudbury&#x27;s Cambrian College, and became an independent institution in 1972. Canadore College has three campuses in North Bay, Ontario, one campus in Parry Sound, Ontario as well as campuses in Brampton, Mississauga and Scarborough through Canadore-affiliated Stanford International College of Business and Technology. The fraction of students who are international, on a student visa, has grown significantly in the past decade, from 5% in 2012-13, to 72% in 2021-22. In 2024 enrolment remained majority international students from India.

==Programs==
Canadore College offers more than 65 full-time post-secondary programs, focused in several key academic sectors: aviation technology; business and management; community justice and police studies; culinary arts; environmental studies and biotechnology; health, human care and wellness; indigenous studies; language, access and preparatory studies; media, design and dramatic arts; sport and recreation; and trades and technology. Part-time studies in business; general interest; geographic information systems; health sciences; hospitality; information technology; languages; law and justice; preparatory studies; recreation and leisure services; trades and technology; and transportation are also offered in the traditional classroom and/or online.

Following comments from North Bay City Councillor describing Canadore as a toxic workplace, Canadore president George Burton filed an ethics complaint. The investigation, in 2024, found no issue with the toxic workplace statement. Canadore had previously faced 2019 allegations from over 50 staff of being a toxic workplace. A subsequent third-party investigation was conducted in 2020 which Canadore refused to relesse publicly. Following Canadore&#x27;s failure to release the report, and accounts of reprisal and psychological abuse, unions called for the suspension of Canadore administrators.

==Student life==

===Sport and wellness===

Canadore athletes (Panthers) compete at the OCAA (Ontario Colleges Athletic Association) varsity level in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, and men&#x27;s basketball. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor soccer teams are at the extramural level.

==Buildings and features==
Canadore shares its main campus facilities with Nipissing University. Canadore College has four campuses: Aviation Technology Campus, Commerce Court Campus, and the Education Centre (College Drive Campus) in North Bay, Ontario, and one campus in West Parry Sound, Ontario, and three campuses in the GTA (Scarborough, Mississauga and Brampton) – Canadore at Stanford. 

The Education Centre is situated on a wooded escarpment with over of wilderness trails.

In 2018, Canadore opened The Village, a new $20 million &quot;health and wellness centre&quot;.

In 2022, Canadore and the Province of Ontario announced a joint project to build and staff an addictions treatment centre in North Bay. Following incomplete building renovations in 2024 the cancellation of the project was announced stating &quot;Ontario Health lost confidence in Canadore’s ability to meet the operational and clinical requirements needed to open the 53 addiction recovery beds&quot;.

==Residences==

Canadore College offers apartment-style residences, also referred to as Lower Residence. On September 9, 2023, a group of 50–100 Canadore international students, with no place to stay, erected a tent village. The tents were setup outside Canadore property which they were denied access to. Following the tent village being erected the college promised a solution within three business days.

<doc id="533991" wikidata="Q3307558" url="?curid=533991" title="Ergastic substance">
<text>Ergastic substances are non-protoplasmic materials found in cells. The living protoplasm of a cell is sometimes called the bioplasm and distinct from the ergastic substances of the cell. The latter are usually organic or inorganic substances that are products of metabolism, and include crystals, oil drops, gums, tannins, resins and other compounds that can aid the organism in defense, maintenance of cellular structure, or just substance storage. Ergastic substances may appear in the protoplasm, in vacuoles, or in the cell wall.

==Carbohydrates==
Reserve carbohydrate of plants are the derivatives of the end products of photosynthesis. Cellulose and starch are the main ergastic substances of plant cells. Cellulose is the chief component of the cell wall, and starch occurs as a reserve material in the protoplasm.

Starch, as starch grains, arise almost exclusively in plastids, especially leucoplasts and amyloplasts.

==Proteins==
Although proteins are the main component of living protoplasm, proteins can occur as inactive, ergastic bodies—in an amorphous or crystalline (or crystalloid) form. A well-known amorphous ergastic protein is gluten.

==Fats and oils==
Fats (lipids) and oils are widely distributed in plant tissues. Substances related to fats—waxes, suberin, and cutin—occur as protective layers in or on the cell wall.

==Crystals==
Animals eliminate excess inorganic materials; plants mostly deposit such material in their tissues. Such mineral matter is mostly salts of calcium and anhydrides of silica.

* Raphides are a type of elongated crystalline form of calcium oxalate aggregated in bundles within a plant cell. Because of the needle-like form, large numbers in the tissue of, say, a leaf can render the leaf unpalatable to herbivores (see Dieffenbachia and taro).
* Druse
* Cystolith

<doc id="534001" wikidata="Q84230" url="?curid=534001" title="Secretion">
<text>Secretion is the movement of material from one point to another, such as a secreted chemical substance from a cell or gland. In contrast, excretion is the removal of certain substances or waste products from a cell or organism. The classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the plasma membrane called porosomes. Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structures embedded in the cell membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.

Secretion in bacterial species means the transport or translocation of effector molecules. For example: proteins, enzymes or toxins (such as cholera toxin in pathogenic bacteria e.g. &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;) from across the interior (cytoplasm or cytosol) of a bacterial cell to its exterior. Secretion is a very important mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural surrounding environment for adaptation and survival.

==In eukaryotic cells==
===Mechanism===
Eukaryotic cells, including human cells, have a highly evolved process of secretion. Proteins targeted for the outside are synthesized by ribosomes docked to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As they are synthesized, these proteins translocate into the ER lumen, where they are glycosylated and where molecular chaperones aid protein folding. Misfolded proteins are usually identified here and retrotranslocated by ER-associated degradation to the cytosol, where they are degraded by a proteasome. The vesicles containing the properly folded proteins then enter the Golgi apparatus.

In the Golgi apparatus, the glycosylation of the proteins is modified and further post-translational modifications, including cleavage and functionalization, may occur. The proteins are then moved into secretory vesicles which travel along the cytoskeleton to the edge of the cell. More modification can occur in the secretory vesicles (for example insulin is cleaved from proinsulin in the secretory vesicles).

Eventually, there is vesicle fusion with the cell membrane at porosomes, by a process called exocytosis, dumping its contents out of the cell&#x27;s environment.

Strict biochemical control is maintained over this sequence by usage of a pH gradient: the pH of the cytosol is 7.4, the ER&#x27;s pH is 7.0, and the cis-golgi has a pH of 6.5. Secretory vesicles have pHs ranging between 5.0 and 6.0; some secretory vesicles evolve into lysosomes, which have a pH of 4.8.

====Nonclassical secretion====
There are many proteins like FGF1 (aFGF), FGF2 (bFGF), interleukin-1 (IL1) etc. which do not have a signal sequence. They do not use the classical ER-Golgi pathway. These are secreted through various nonclassical pathways.

At least four nonclassical (unconventional) protein secretion pathways have been described. They include:
* direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane likely through membrane transport proteins
* blebbing
* lysosomal secretion
* release via exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies
In addition, proteins can be released from cells by mechanical or physiological wounding and through non-lethal, transient oncotic pores in the plasma membrane induced by washing cells with serum-free media or buffers.

===In human tissues===
Many human cell types have the ability to be secretory cells. They have a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus to fulfill this function. Tissues that produce secretions include the gastrointestinal tract which secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid, the lungs which secrete surfactants, and sebaceous glands which secrete sebum to lubricate the skin and hair. Meibomian glands in the eyelid secrete meibum to lubricate and protect the eye.

==In gram-negative bacteria==

Secretion is not unique to eukaryotes – it is also present in bacteria and archaea as well. ATP binding cassette (ABC) type transporters are common to the three domains of life. Some secreted proteins are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the SecYEG translocon, one of two translocation systems, which requires the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide on the secreted protein. Others are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the twin-arginine translocation pathway (Tat). Gram-negative bacteria have two membranes, thus making secretion topologically more complex. There are at least six specialized secretion systems in Gram-negative bacteria.

===Type I secretion system (T1SS or TOSS)===

Type I secretion is a chaperone dependent secretion system employing the Hly and Tol gene clusters. The process begins as a leader sequence on the protein to be secreted is recognized by HlyA and binds HlyB on the membrane. This signal sequence is extremely specific for the ABC transporter. The HlyAB complex stimulates HlyD which begins to uncoil and reaches the outer membrane where TolC recognizes a terminal molecule or signal on HlyD. HlyD recruits TolC to the inner membrane and HlyA is excreted outside of the outer membrane via a long-tunnel protein channel.

Type I secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 – 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; cell adhesion protein LapA of 520 kDa. The best characterized are the RTX toxins and the lipases. Type I secretion is also involved in export of non-proteinaceous substrates like cyclic β-glucans and polysaccharides.

===Type II secretion system (T2SS)===

Proteins secreted through the type II system, or main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway, depend on the Sec or Tat system for initial transport into the periplasm. Once there, they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12–14 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin protein, 10–15 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. Gram-negative type IV pili use a modified version of the type II system for their biogenesis, and in some cases certain proteins are shared between a pilus complex and type II system within a single bacterial species.

===Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)===
It is homologous to the basal body in bacterial flagella. It is like a molecular syringe through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Yersinia&quot;, &quot;Vibrio&quot;) can inject proteins into eukaryotic cells. The low Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol opens the gate that regulates T3SS. One such mechanism to detect low calcium concentration has been illustrated by the lcrV (Low Calcium Response) antigen utilized by &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, which is used to detect low calcium concentrations and elicits T3SS attachment. The Hrp system in plant pathogens inject harpins and pathogen effector proteins through similar mechanisms into plants. This secretion system was first discovered in &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host&#x27;s cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.

===Type IV secretion system (T4SS or TFSS)===

It is homologous to conjugation machinery of bacteria, the conjugative pili. It is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, which uses this system to introduce the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into the plant host, which in turn causes the affected area to develop into a crown gall (tumor). &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; uses a type IV secretion system to deliver CagA into gastric epithelial cells, which is associated with gastric carcinogenesis. &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, the causative agent of whooping cough, secretes the pertussis toxin partly through the type IV system. &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, the causing agent of legionellosis (Legionnaires&#x27; disease) utilizes a type IVB secretion system, known as the icm/dot (intracellular multiplication / defect in organelle trafficking genes) system, to translocate numerous effector proteins into its eukaryotic host. The prototypic Type IVA secretion system is the VirB complex of &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;.

Protein members of this family are components of the type IV secretion system. They mediate intracellular transfer of macromolecules via a mechanism ancestrally related to that of bacterial conjugation machineries.

====Function====
The Type IV secretion system (T4SS) is the general mechanism by which bacterial cells secrete or take up macromolecules. Their precise mechanism remains unknown. T4SS is encoded on Gram-negative conjugative elements in bacteria. T4SS are cell envelope-spanning complexes, or, in other words, 11–13 core proteins that form a channel through which DNA and proteins can travel from the cytoplasm of the donor cell to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. T4SS also secrete virulence factor proteins directly into host cells as well as taking up DNA from the medium during natural transformation.

====Structure====
As shown in the above figure, TraC, in particular consists of a three helix bundle and a loose globular appendage.

====Interactions====
T4SS has two effector proteins: firstly, ATS-1, which stands for Anaplasma translocated substrate 1, and secondly AnkA, which stands for ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein A. Additionally, T4SS coupling proteins are VirD4, which bind to VirE2.

===Type V secretion system (T5SS)===
Also called the autotransporter system, type V secretion involves use of the &quot;Sec&quot; system for crossing the inner membrane. Proteins which use this pathway have the capability to form a beta-barrel with their C-terminus which inserts into the outer membrane, allowing the rest of the peptide (the passenger domain) to reach the outside of the cell. Often, autotransporters are cleaved, leaving the beta-barrel domain in the outer membrane and freeing the passenger domain. Some researchers believe remnants of the autotransporters gave rise to the porins which form similar beta-barrel structures. A common example of an autotransporter that uses this secretion system is the Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins.

===Type VI secretion system (T6SS)===
Type VI secretion systems were originally identified in 2006 by the group of John Mekalanos at the Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) in two bacterial pathogens, &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. These were identified when mutations in the Hcp and VrgG genes in &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; led to decreased virulence and pathogenicity. Since then, Type VI secretion systems have been found in a quarter of all proteobacterial genomes, including animal, plant, human pathogens, as well as soil, environmental or marine bacteria. While most of the early studies of Type VI secretion focused on its role in the pathogenesis of higher organisms, more recent studies suggested a broader physiological role in defense against simple eukaryotic predators and its role in inter-bacteria interactions. The Type VI secretion system gene clusters contain from 15 to more than 20 genes, two of which, Hcp and VgrG, have been shown to be nearly universally secreted substrates of the system. Structural analysis of these and other proteins in this system bear a striking resemblance to the tail spike of the T4 phage, and the activity of the system is thought to functionally resemble phage infection.

===Type VII secretion system (T7SS)===
===Type VIII secretion system (T8SS)===
===Release of outer membrane vesicles===
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of bacterial outer membrane vesicles. Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming nano-scale spherical structures made of a lipopolysaccharide-rich lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials, and are deployed for membrane vesicle trafficking to manipulate environment or invade at host–pathogen interface. Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.

==In gram-positive bacteria==

In some &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot; species, the accessory secretory system handles the export of highly repetitive adhesion glycoproteins.

<doc id="534003" wikidata="Q5310260" url="?curid=534003" title="Duality (electricity and magnetism)">
<text>In physics, the electromagnetic dual concept is based on the idea that, in the static case, electromagnetism has two separate facets: electric fields and magnetic fields. Expressions in one of these will have a directly analogous, or dual, expression in the other. The reason for this can ultimately be traced to special relativity, where applying the Lorentz transformation to the electric field will transform it into a magnetic field. These are special cases of duality in mathematics.

* The electric field () is the dual of the magnetic field ().
* The electric displacement field () is the dual of the magnetic flux density ().
* Faraday&#x27;s law of induction is the dual of Ampère&#x27;s circuital law.
* Gauss&#x27;s law for electric field is the dual of Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism.
* The electric potential is the dual of the magnetic potential.
* Permittivity is the dual of permeability.
* Electrostriction is the dual of magnetostriction.
* Piezoelectricity is the dual of piezomagnetism.
* Ferroelectricity is the dual of ferromagnetism.
* An electrostatic motor is the dual of a magnetic motor;
* Electrets are the dual of permanent magnets;
* The Faraday effect is the dual of the Kerr effect;
* The hypothetical magnetic monopole is the dual of electric charge.

Additionally, in a sense different from the dualities above:
* The Aharonov–Casher effect is the dual to the Aharonov–Bohm effect.
In the usual sense of electromagnetic duality, the (unobserved) dual of the Aharonov-Bohm effect would be the phase acquired by a hypothetical magnetic monopole traveling through electric field. In contrast, the Aharonov–Casher effect is for a magnetic dipole (moment) in electric field, and its dual in the usual sense is for an electric dipole in magnetic field, which is distinct from the Aharonov–Bohm effect.

<text>555 California Street, formerly Bank of America Center, is a 52-story skyscraper in San Francisco, California. It is the fourth tallest building in the city as of February 2021, and in 2013 was the largest by floor area. Completed in 1969, the tower was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River until the completion of the Transamerica Pyramid in 1972, and the world headquarters of Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank, when the company moved its headquarters to the Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust and The Trump Organization.

==Background==
Colloquially known as &quot;Triple Five&quot; and/or &quot;Triple Nickel&quot;, 555 California Street was meant to display the wealth, power, and importance of Bank of America. Design was by Wurster, Bernardi and Emmons and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with architect Pietro Belluschi consulting; structural engineering was by the San Francisco firm H. J. Brunnier Associates. It is the 75th tallest building in the United States, one foot taller than One Worldwide Plaza in New York City and just 1 foot shorter than the 68th tallest building in the US, which is also owned by Bank of America, the Bank of America Center in Houston, Texas at 780 ft (238 m), and just 2 feet shorter than the 67th tallest building in the US, 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey at 781 ft (238 m). Some sites round the heights of all four buildings to 780 ft (238 m) making those four buildings tied as the 67th tallest buildings in the country. As of February 2021, 555 California Street is the 89th tallest building in the United States, and the 103rd tallest in North America.

The skyscraper has thousands of bay windows, meant to improve the rental value and to symbolize the bay windows common in San Francisco residential real estate. The irregular cutout areas near the top of the building were designed to suggest the Sierra Nevada. At the north side of the skyscraper is a broad plaza named in honor of Bank of America founder A.P. Giannini.

In the plaza the 200-ton black Swedish granite sculpture &quot;Transcendence&quot; by Masayuki Nagare is known as the &quot;Banker&#x27;s Heart&quot;. Nearly the entire block—the skyscraper, the banking hall, the plaza, the stairways, and the sidewalks—is clad in costly polished or rough carnelian granite. A restaurant, the &quot;Carnelian Room,&quot; was on the 52nd floor. The elevator to this restaurant is one of the few publicly accessible high-speed elevators in San Francisco. The restaurant closed at midnight New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009.

The southeast corner of California and Kearny is about above sea level, so the top of the building is over . With the Transamerica Pyramid, 555 California Street shows the direction San Francisco&#x27;s downtown was moving during the 1960s before campaigns against high-rise buildings in the 1970s and 1980s forced development to move south of Market Street. With its top spire, the Transamerica Pyramid is taller, but 555 California has the higher habitable space.

In April 2018, the United States Geological Survey included 555 California Street in a list of 39 high-rise buildings in San Francisco constructed during a period when welding techniques were employed that may jeopardize structural integrity during a strong earthquake.

A 70 percent interest was acquired by Vornado Realty Trust from foreign investors in March 2007 with a 30 percent limited partnership interest still owned by The Trump Organization In 2019, the building generated $86 million in net operating income ($60 million going to Vornado and $26 million to Trump Organization), and it had $543 million of debt attached to it in 2020. Trump&#x27;s stake in 555 California Street is one of his largest holdings as of 2020. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated in 2020 that Trump owes $162 million to an unknown creditor for this object alone; the loan comes due in 2021. At least one tenant in this building whose rent benefits Trump, the Qatar Investment Authority, is an empty office as of 2020. On May 19, 2021, Trump announced that a $1.2B loan had closed on the property at an interest rate of 2% annualized.

==In popular culture==
Since the opening of the building in 1969, it has been purportedly haunted with unexplained activity happening throughout the building such as moving cold air spots, landline phones lifting the receivers by themselves, and files and paperwork flying off shelves.

In 1971, 555 California Street appeared at the beginning of the film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, where it is the roof from which Scorpio snipes a woman in the now-closed pool atop what is now the Hilton Financial District hotel on Kearny Street. The film shows panoramic views of San Francisco from the roof of the building. In 1974, 555 California Street was again used for a box-office hit, this time in Irwin Allen&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, in which the outside plaza substituted for that of the film&#x27;s fictional skyscraper, the infamous Glass Tower which on the night of its dedication catches fire. Many scenes were also filmed in the interior ground-floor lobby. The granite stairs coming up from California Street to the A.P. Giannini plaza were used for several key specific scenes including the opening dedication ceremony, the arrival of fire trucks and the final scene on the steps with the characters played by Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. The rooftop setting of the building used in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was also used a decade later in the Chuck Norris film &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot; (1981). The building can also be seen under construction in the 1968 film &quot;Bullitt&quot;. The building is featured as a landmark in the 2003 video game SimCity 4, under its previous name.

<doc id="534010" wikidata="Q1858066" url="?curid=534010" title="Maryland State House">
<text>The Maryland State House is located in Annapolis, Maryland. It is the oldest U.S. state capitol in continuous legislative use, dating to 1772, and houses the Maryland General Assembly, plus the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. In 1783 and 1784 it served as the capitol building of the United States Congress of the Confederation, and is where Ratification Day, the formal end of the American Revolutionary War, occurred.

The capitol has the distinction of being topped by the largest wooden dome in the United States constructed without nails. The current building, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, is the third statehouse on its site. The building is administered by the State House Trust, established in 1969.

==Construction and history==
Construction began in 1772, but was not completed until 1797 due to the ongoing American Revolutionary War. The two-story brick Georgian style structure, located inside State Circle, was designed by architect Joseph Horatio Anderson. A small portico juts out from the center of the building, topped by a pediment, with two high arched windows framing the entrance. On both floors, large rectangular windows line the facade. A cornice is topped by another pediment and the sloping roof gives way for a central octagonal drum atop which rests a dome. The large dome is topped by a balustraded balcony, another octagonal drum and a lantern capped by a lightning rod. The rod was constructed and grounded according to the direct specifications of its inventor, Benjamin Franklin.

The building was surrounded by a low brick wall in 1818 to prevent cattle incursions. This was replaced by an iron fence with a granite base in 1836. The dome of the statehouse is depicted on the Maryland state quarter.

An annex to the State House was constructed between 1902 and 1906 under the supervision of Baltimore architects Baldwin &amp; Pennington; the new annex replaced earlier 19th-century annexes. The current state House of Delegates and Senate chambers are part of the annex, which is clad in black and gold Italian marble. The annex includes the Grand Staircase from the first to the second floors; above the staircase is the painting &quot;Washington Resigning His Commission&quot; by Edwin White, executed in 1858. In 2017, two additional paintings, both from the collection of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, were hung above the staircase. These additions were a portrait of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore by Allan Ramsay () and a portrait of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore by Johann Ludwig Tietz ().

In the mid-1990s, the cypress dome underwent a structural renovation and repainting. However, the latex paint that was used failed to bond due to preceding layers, causing it to flake. In 2011, the old paint was removed and replaced with white oil-based paint.

==Grounds==

Adjacent to the State House is Lawyers Mall, an open space which was designated in 1973 after the demolition of the Court of Appeals building, which had sat at the location since 1906. Statues of Baltimore native Thurgood Marshall, the first black U.S. Supreme Court justice, as well as Donald Gaines Murray, the first African-American to enter the University of Maryland School of Law since 1890, and a bench with statues of two anonymous children symbolizing the victory of Marshall&#x27;s litigation in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, all sit on Lawyers Mall. The space is the focal point of First Amendment activities on capitol grounds.

Until 2017, there was a statue of Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the United States, on the lawn of the State House. The statue was erected in 1872. The statue of Taney, a Marylander, was controversial because of Taney&#x27;s support for slavery and his authorship of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857), which upheld the denial of citizenship to African Americans. As a result, a movement in support of removing the statue emerged. At first, the State House Trust—made up of the governor, the speaker of the state house, the president of the state senate, and the chair of the Maryland Historical Trust Board of Trustees—responded by adding interpretive plaques &quot;explaining the controversy over his divisive opinion and its place in the evolution of the nation&#x27;s stance toward slavery.&quot; The Trust also added a statue of Marshall on Lawyers Mall, and agreed in 2016 to place statues of abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass in the State House. In the wake of the Charlottesville car attack in 2017, House Speaker Michael E. Busch called for the removal of the Taney statue, as did Governor Larry Hogan a day later. It was removed just after midnight on August 18, 2017.

==Rotunda==
The rotunda is the primary home of the &quot;Maryland Federalist&quot;, a 1987 replica of the original &quot;Federalist&quot;, a tiny ship built by Baltimore merchants in 1788 to celebrate Maryland&#x27;s ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Large Corinthian columns support the arches bracing the large dome above. A balustrade lines the second floor balcony.

In the summer of 2012, the original handwritten text of George Washington&#x27;s resignation letter was on display in the rotunda. It was again put on display in March 2020 alongside the original Star-Spangled Banner by Francis Scott Key on loan from the Maryland Center for History and Culture.

==Chambers==

===Old Senate Chamber===
To the right of the entrance is the old Senate Chamber. Chairs and desks were added to the room in the exact number (16) as originally furbished. The desk for the president is an original piece made by John Shaw in 1797. Above the fireplace is the painting &quot;Washington, Lafayette &amp; Tilghman at Yorktown&quot; by Charles Willson Peale; the work was commissioned by the Maryland Legislature in 1783 and added to the State House collection the following year. The painting depicts General George Washington, Lafayette and Washington&#x27;s aide-de-camp Tench Tilghman.

It was in the Old Senate Chamber that Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. A bronze statue of Washington stands in the room.

On February 2, 1781, Governor Thomas Sim Lee signed and sealed the &quot;act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the Articles of Confederation.&quot; The decision established the requisite unanimous consent of all thirteen states for the formation of a Perpetual Union.

On September 11, 1786, the Annapolis Convention, an interstate convention to discuss ways to facilitate commerce between the states and the establishment standard rules and regulations, convened here. The convention laid the groundwork for the 1787 Constitutional Convention.

The chamber had extensive investigation beginning in 2007 to solve water leakage problems. As a result of this study, restorers have determined that previous restoration attempts in 1905 and 1940 did not accurately recreate many elements of the room. A report of their findings was issued in January 2010. The restoration work was completed in 2015 and the chamber reopened to the public.

===Working Senate Chamber===
The Senate chamber is located in a wing added to the original structure between 1902 and 1905. The room is illuminated by a Tiffany-style skylight above. Red carpet emblazoned with the state seal covers the entire floor. Large Ionic columns line the walls and support the viewing gallery. The marble along the walls and the columns are flecked with rust and black, Maryland&#x27;s official colors.

Two famous Marylanders are featured in statues flanking the podium: John Hanson, the first president by the Articles of Confederation, and Charles Carroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Four portraits of Declaration of Independence signatories for Maryland hang on the walls: William Paca, Thomas Stone, Samuel Chase, and Charles Carroll. There are also portraits of Edwin Warfield and John Walter Smith.

===Working House Chamber===
The House of Delegates chamber is also in the new wing to the building. The carpet is navy blue and designed with a diamond and olive sheaths. The same rust and black marble lines the chamber and forms the Ionic columns along the walls. A spectators&#x27; gallery is above the rostrum. The speaker sits in front of a broken marble pediment supporting a clock. Portraits of former Speakers of the House hang on the walls.

===Governor&#x27;s Reception Room===
The Governor&#x27;s Reception Room is on the second floor. The room is mainly ceremonial and used for bill signings. Portraits of former governors hang on the walls. Portraits of Henrietta Maria and Queen Anne hang nearby. The room was originally used as the Council Chamber for Maryland&#x27;s executive council, which was abolished in state constitutional reforms in 1838; it became known as the Governor&#x27;s Reception Room in the 1860s.

===State House Caucus Room===
What is now known as the State House Caucus Room was originally divided into two rooms housing the records of the Land Office and the General Court (which later became Court of Appeals of Maryland). After the Old House of Delegates Chamber was expanded in 1858, the room was divided between the private office of the speaker of the House of Delegates (rear half) and a cloakroom (front half). In 1905–06, the room was likely renovated, and became known as the Flag Room, which housed various Civil War battle flags and ceremonial weapons. The room was later used by the Department of Legislative Reference and became known as the &quot;Bill Room&quot; by the 1940s. From the early 1980s until 2008, the room was used as the Maryland State House Visitor Center. In 2011, the bill became the State House Caucus Room, and is now used for meetings.

The Caucus Room houses most of the 48-piece silver service from the armored cruiser USS &quot;Maryland&quot;, which was decommissioned in 1947. The pieces in the set show 167 scenes from Maryland history, with each piece focusing on one of Maryland&#x27;s 23 counties and Baltimore. The silver was transferred from the Maryland Historical Society to the State House in 1962. In 1992, four pieces from the service were given to the submarine USS &quot;Maryland&quot;. In addition to the silver, the Caucus Room contains a 19th-century bust of Reverdy Johnson.

Paintings in the Caucus Room include both portraits and landscapes. Portraits in the room are originals depicting Oden Bowie (by Katherine Walton), Frank Brown (by Louis P. Dieterich), Leonard Calvert (attributed to Jacob van Oost or Jacob van Oost the Younger), Elihu Emory Jackson (by Ida Foster), Robert M. McLane (by George Peter Alexander Healy), Thomas Swann (by Florence Mackubin), Francis Thomas (by Franklin Barber Clark), William Pinkney Whyte (by David Bendann), and Levin Winder (by Florence Mackubin). The room also contains reproductions of portraits of Clarence W. Blount (by Simmie Knox) and Mary Eliza Watters Risteau (by Talmadge of New York).

==National capital==
From November 26, 1783, to August 13, 1784, Annapolis was the capital of the United States. The Congress of the Confederation met in the Maryland State House. Subsequently, Annapolis was a candidate to become the new permanent national capital before Washington, D.C., was built.

It was in the Old Senate Chamber that Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784, formally ending the American Revolutionary War.

==United States district court==
The United States District Court for the District of Maryland met there for the first decade of its existence. In 1800, judge Samuel Chase tried a local postmaster for embezzlement and sentenced him to thirty-nine lashes. To execute the sentence, the defendant was tied to one of the statehouse columns.

<text>Cow Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, in north central Montana in the United States. Cow Creek rises in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri approximately northeast of Winifred, Montana—or upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge. 
==Name==
The creek&#x27;s Gros Ventre name is , meaning &#x27;big gulch&#x27;.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Cow Creek flows from the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains to the Missouri through a unique and remote area known as the Missouri Breaks. The breaks are extensive and steeply eroded badlands. They are so rough that they are a barrier to travel by animals or man. They extend along the Missouri River for over . In this long stretch of river the Missouri Breaks extend back from the river on either side, for many miles. As the Missouri flows through this 200 mile stretch, the breaks limit access to the river from the wide grasslands north and south of the river.

Cow Creek provides one of the few access routes down to the Missouri River through the Missouri Breaks. As Cow Creek flows through the breaks it passes between high canyon like walls, but the stream meanders back and forth over a canyon floor that is relatively level and from in width.

The canyon bottom along Cow Creek creates a corridor of travel from the northern Montana plains down to the river through the breaks. Sediments seasonally washed out from the mouth of Cow Creek into the Missouri River formed Cow Island, just downriver from the creek mouth. Cow Island divides the Missouri into two channels, which makes crossing the broad Missouri easier at this point. On the south side of the river opposite the Cow Island, a steep but relatively short four mile climb out of the breaks gains the wide plains of Central Montana south of the river.

This combination of geographic features made Cow Creek and the ford at Cow Island an ancient highway of travel. For thousands of years, Cow Creek and the Cow Island ford was used by migrating buffalo herds and other migrating animals, and by nomadic Native Americans bent on going between the plains north of the Missouri River Breaks and the plains lying south of the Missouri Breaks.

===Lewis and Clark expedition===
Lewis and Clark passed Cow Creek on May 26, 1805, after they had camped two miles below Cow Creek. Cow Creek was originally named Windsor Creek in the journals of the expedition for Pvt. Richard Windsor, but was later named Cow Creek by fur traders. May 26, 1805 was the day that Clark climbed out of the breaks (probably going up Bull Whacker Creek, and climbing up on a ridge), where he saw the Rocky Mountains for the first time. When Windsor/Cow Creek was noted by Lewis, it was reported to be 30 yards wide, which meant it would be in spring flood stage. Normally Windsor/Cow Creek would be a few yards wide, and in very dry weather (during a dry summer, or in the depth of a dry winter) it can become a trickle between stagnant pools of water.

===Steamboat landing===
The mouth of Cow Creek became a steamboat landing, known as Cow Island landing, in the later months of the summer and fall when the Missouri river level dropped to a level so that steamboats could not get through a series of rapids above Cow Island, which are Bird Rapids, Cabin Rapids, Dauphine Rapids, and Deadman Rapids. Being some 126 river miles short of Ft. Benton, steamboats had to offload their cargo at the Cow Island landing for it to be freighted the rest of the way up the Cow Island trail.

Once gold was discovered in the Montana Territory in 1862, the Missouri River became the most reliable pathway to bring passengers and freight—particularly heavy or bulky freight—to the booming gold fields. In the era from 1860 the mid-1880s steamboats brought supplies and heavy equipment some from ports like St. Louis in &quot;the states&quot; to the upriver terminus port of Ft. Benton in the Montana Territory.

The final of the river was called the &quot;upper Missouri&quot; – this stretch traversed remote unsettled plains, and the last few hundred miles to Ft. Benton passed through the Missouri Breaks. In May and June the Missouri River has &quot;high water&quot; from mountain snow melt, and steamboats who caught this flood could travel all the way through the breaks to reach the upriver terminus at Ft. Benton. Later, in the summer and fall the water levels dropped, and there was &quot;low water&quot; on the upper Missouri. When &quot;low water&quot; came, deeper draft steamboats often could not reach Ft. Benton, and they had to drop their cargos downstream in the Missouri Breaks.

Each year during the steamboat era, in the late summer and fall, if there wasn&#x27;t a full three feet of water depth in the channel, Cow Island and the mouth of Cow Creek became a river port, known as Cow Island landing. The mouth of Cow Cree is 126 river miles below Ft. Benton. Some 24 miles above Cow Island was Dauphine Rapids, which was the worst of the rapids. It was difficult to run even in high water, but was a deadly barrier to riverboats in low water. If a steamboat could get through Dauphine Rapids, they then faced Deadman Rapids, some 18 miles further up the river. In the stretch of river below Deadman and Dauphine Rapids, Cow Island landing was the best place from which freight could be offloaded and then transported overland to Ft. Benton, via the Cow Island Trail.

To offload cargo at Cow island, the steamboats used a landing point several hundred yards above Cow Creek, in front of the now abandoned buildings of the Kipp homestead (see photo), or down river, several hundreds of yards below Cow Creek. The steamboats used landing sites where the water of the Missouri was deep up against the north bank, so the river boats could pull in close to the bank to discharge cargo.

===Cow Island Trail===
The wagon road that started at Cow Island Landing and went up Cow Creek, then out onto broad grassy plains and on to Ft. Benton, was called the Cow Island Trail. This road up Cow Creek traversed the only possible team-and-wagon route in this part of the rough badlands known as the Missouri Breaks. At 35 miles long, Cow Creek is one of the longer Missouri tributaries in the breaks. It extends north to the Bearpaw Mountains where it receives seasonal spring snow melt. Over many millenniums, this greater seasonal discharge eroded and widened the creek bottom so it became flat enough for a team and wagon to traverse. From the steamboat landing on the Missouri, the trail went north up the Cow Creek bottom for to Davidson Coulee, at which time the trail turned west and climbed up a long steep grade on Davidson Ridge to reach the plains north of the Missouri River Breaks.

 From year to year, and month to month the volume of freight on the Cow Island Trail fluctuated depending on whether the riverboats had high water so they could get up river to Fort Benton, or whether low water over the Dauphine and other rapids caused riverboats to offload at Cow Island Landing. Starting in 1863 the Cow Island Trail had high volumes of freight traffic. 1863 was a low water year, and word was spreading that there were rich strikes in Montana Territory gold fields. In 1866 there was good water till July, so freight volume declined. 1868 was a different story. By year end, 2,500 men, 3,000 teams and 20,000 oxen ere involved in freighting on the Cow Island Trail to Ft. Benton.

No permanent storehouses were erected at Cow Island. Once freight was offloaded at Cow Island, it was tarped and remained only briefly before being moved to Ft. Benton. The high profits on freight could only be realized once the goods had gotten to Ft. Benton. A common outfit on the trail was 2 wagons, each pulled by six to eight oxen, with two bullwhackers. Oxen were preferred over horses and mules because they required less food and water, did not wander during storms, and &quot;Indians didn&#x27;t steal them because they couldn&#x27;t ride them and they were to tough to eat&quot;.

The Cow Creek Trail was far from ideal, and carrying freight to Fr. Benton was never an easy task. In the confines of Cow Creek&#x27;s narrow but relatively flat creek bottom, the creek meanders from one steep coulee sidewall to the other. While traveling the 15 miles up Cow Creek the heavy freight wagons had to ford Cow Creek 31 times. The fords would wash out if the area had a heavy rain. In wetter weather heavy wagons could bog down at a creek crossing. After going 15 miles up the creek bottom, the freighters encountered long steep grades. The freighters had to stop, unhitch and &quot;double team&quot; or even &quot;triple team&quot; each of the wagons. In 1864 while ascending a steep grade on the trail, a wagon ran its outside wheels off the trail and went over, dragging the ox team with it. The descent of 300 feet killed the oxen, badly damaged the wagon and scattered its contents.

===Nez Perce War===

On September 23, 1877, several hundred Nez Perce crossed the Missouri at Cow Creek in their flight toward Canada. An army garrison of twelve men under Sergeant William Molchert was at Cow Island Landing, along with four civilian clerks who represented freighting interests in the region. Fifty tons of freight, which had been offloaded from steamboats, lay under tarpaulins at the landing awaiting shipment by wagon to Fort Benton or other remote corners of the Montana Territory.

The Nez Perce crossed the Missouri at several places. The group observed by soldiers first sent an advance guard of 20 or so warriors across, who spread out on the north bank. Then the women and children crossed with pack animals and camp equipment, and finally a rear guard of warriors crossed.

Several armed encounters involving the Nez Perce occurred on Cow Creek, but the most important event was the fateful decision made while in camp on Cow Creek on September 25, 1877.

The squad of soldiers at Cow Island Landing on September 23, 1877, had been sent to guard the stockpiled supplies, which had been offloaded from steamboats. Upon the arrival of the Nez Perce, the soldiers and the clerks retreated into an earthen entrenchment which had been built around their tents to divert rain water. The entrenchment was a few hundred yards from the ford. Significantly the entrenchment was also a few hundred yards from the stacked supplies.

After crossing the river, the main body of the Nez Perce went past the soldiers without incident, and camped about two miles up Cow Creek. A small group of Nez Perce rode to the entrenchment. They indicated friendly intentions and asked for some of the stockpiled food. The army sergeant in charge at first ignored their request which reduced the Nez Perce to begging. Finally the sergeant gave them one bag of hardtack and one side of bacon from the soldier&#x27;s own stores. At sundown gunfire broke from Indians in the breaks, who had located themselves so they could fire down into the entrenchment. Two civilians were wounded and the soldiers, though able to return fire, were now pinned down. The supplies were far enough from the entrenchment so that, as night fell, the Indians could filter out of the steep eroded breaks and get to the supplies without coming under effective fire. After dark the Indians broke into the supplies, and took what they found desirable in the dark. The supplies were set on fire. A large stockpile of bacon burned brightly for most of the night. The soldiers attributed the illumination from this blaze with preventing a concerted attack, but it is more likely that the Nez Perce only wanted the supplies and not a pitched battle with the soldiers. The Indians and the soldiers exchanged sporadic gunfire through the night until about 10:00 in the morning, after which the Nez Perce moved off up Cow Creek. Two civilians and one Nez Perce warrior were wounded.

On September 22, 1877, before the arrival of the Nez Perce, a wagon train had left Cow Island Landing with 35 tons of freight and a herd of cattle, heading up Cow Island Trail for Ft. Benton. On September 24 while still in Cow Island Canyon, the train was overtaken by the Nez Perce who approached them unthreateningly and camped one and one half miles away. That evening some Nez Perce visited the camp of the wagon train and there were civil exchanges between the members of the wagon train and the Nez Perce who wanted to trade for ammunition and other goods.

On the morning of September 25, a small army relief force under Major Guido Igles approached the rear of the Nez Perce assemblage on Cow Creek. Major Igles had come from Ft. Benton to the aid of the outpost at Cow Island Landing. He was leading a handful of soldiers and civilian volunteers from Ft. Benton. After reaching Cow Island on September 24, he had continued on the trail of the Nez Perce.

When the Nez Perce discovered Major Igles coming up Cow Creek, some warriors went down the canyon to take up positions to meet this threat. Other Nez Perce attacked the wagon train. One teamster was killed and the others fled into willows along the creek or into the breaks. The main body of the Nez Perce helped themselves to some goods in the wagons, set them on fire, and continued on up Cow Creek.

Meanwhile, the Nez Perce warriors forming the rear guard had taken up positions on heights facing Major Igles small force which was down in Cow Creek canyon. Firing broke out. The Nez Perce were in a position to fire into Igles position. One civilian was killed. Another was saved when a bullet was deflected by his belt buckle, bruising his abdomen. After two hours, the Nez Perce broke off the engagement. Fearing an ambush and knowing he was greatly outnumbered, Major Igles began a slow and cautious withdrawal to Cow Island Landing. He reported two Nez Perce wounded in the encounter.

On the night of September 25 the steamer &quot;Benton&quot; arrived at Cow Island Landing, discharging fifty tons of freight, and the steamer &quot;Silver City&quot; approached with an additional one hundred tons. Major Igles sent couriers reporting the Nez Perce location to General Miles who was advancing cross country from Ft. Keogh with fresh troops to intercept the Nez Perce.

When the Nez Perce started up Cow Creek, they were only from Canada. While camped on Cow Creek on the evening of September 25 following the skirmish with Major Igles dissention broke out among the Nez Perce leadership between those who wanted to press on and those who wanted to slow to rest tired and weakened people and horses. The Nez Perce believed the soldiers were now far behind them. They were unaware that General Miles was coming cross country from Ft. Keogh as fast as his troops could travel. Those who wanted to go slower won out. Because the Nez Perce paused instead of pressing ahead, on September 30, General Miles&#x27; column caught up with the Nez Perce who were camped on Snake Creek east of the Bear Paw Mountains, just from Canada. Miles immediately attacked. On October 5, 1877, after six days of fighting, and with Nez Perce men, women and children suffering and dying from wounds and exposure to freezing weather, Chief Joseph surrendered the Nez Perce to the U.S. Army commanders.

The capture of the Nez Perce occurred because they delayed in crossing the Canada–US border, allowing General Miles to catch up to them with a fresh force of soldiers, who were superior in number and firepower. The events, &quot;battles&quot; and skirmishes on Cow Creek added to the overall delay, allowing General Miles to close the gap. However the deciding factor that determined the fate of the Nez Perce was the fateful decision made during the tribal council on the evening of September 25, 1877 while in camp along Cow Creek.
===Homesteading===

Where small creeks or streams emerge from the breaks to meet the Missouri, there are broad riverside &quot;bottoms&quot; with meadows and cottonwoods. Cow Creek opens to such a bottom at its junction with the Missouri, and further downstream Bull Creek opens up another bottom as it flows into the Missouri.

Just upstream from the mouth of Cow Creek, the Kipp homestead lies in Cow Creek bottom. It is adjacent to the site of the old upper steamboat landing, above the mouth of Cow Creek. One source reports that the Kipp homestead was originally filed by the historic figure James Kipp (1788–1880) and was lived in by his son, Joseph and then his grandson, James Kipp, but that this Kipp homestead and the homestead downriver on Bull Creek became the property of the Jones family, related by marriage to the Kipp family. Another source indicates the homestead was claimed by Jim Kipp in 1913. Jim was the son of Joseph Kipp (1849–1913) who was the son of the historic figure James Kipp (1788–1880) and his wife Earth Woman. 
The elder historic James Kipp (1788–1880) helped establish Ft. Union at the mouth of the Yellowstone in 1828 and he also founded Ft. Piegan at the mouth of the Marias River in 1831. The Kipp homestead is abandoned but a few cabins and outbuildings remain standing at the homestead site.

Just downstream from the mouth of Cow Creek is the mouth of Bull Creek. Here on Bull Creek bottom is another abandoned homestead with decaying and collapsing log buildings, and the debris from failed farming efforts. This homestead is attributed to the Jones family, related by marriage to the Kipp family. 

Road access to both homesteads was along a primitive road that traveled downstream along the Missouri on the north side of the river to the site of a power plant. This road was still passable from the power plant site to Cow Creek a few years ago. During the homesteading years, one of the few ferries in the Missouri breaks operated at the site of the power plant. From the power plant ferry a road went north to the Zortman area, and another road went south toward Lewistown, Montana.

===Today===
Once an ancient and much used highway for migrating animals and nomadic natives, Cow Creek and the Cow Island Crossing has been reduced to dormant inactivity by the passage of time. The migrating herds of buffalo were hunted to near extinction. The nomadic Native Americans were all placed on reservations, all long removed from Cow Creek. Railroads put an end to the Missouri River steamboat. The Missouri Breaks homesteader went broke or just got discouraged and left. Highway projects through the breaks chose more conveniently located routes than Cow Island or Cow Creek. A few ranches remain along the 35 mile extent of Cow Creek, and these are in the upper portion of the creek, in or near the foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains.

Cow Creek is now one of the more remote and uninhabited spots in an area – the Missouri Breaks – notorious for its isolation. This condition is recognized by the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which is currently considering the lower portion of Cow Creek for wilderness status.

The abandoned buildings of the Kipp homestead on Cow Creek bottom and the homestead on Bull bottom continue to deteriorate. For many years a snubbing post, used to tie up steamboats, was buried in the river bank between the Kipp homestead and the river. The snubbing post may have since washed into the river. It is reported that the remains of the entrenchments are still visible that used by the soldiers in the 1877 skirmish with the Nez Perce that is now known as the &quot;Battle of Cow Island&quot;. For many years the metal wreckage from wagons burned by the Nez Perce on September 25, 1877, could be seen in Cow Creek canyon. An unsupported (and very likely apocryphal) local rumor developed that the wagon train had been carrying gold and it was taken by the Nez Perce and buried in the vicinity.

Lower Cow Creek, where the deserted homesteads are located, is difficult to visit. A mostly dirt surfaced BLM road runs west from Montana Highway 66 for , before dropping down into Bull Creek. Bull Creek joins the Missouri very near Cow Island, and from Bull Creek one can get to the adjacent mouth of Cow Creek. In the descent from the high ridges of the breaks into the Missouri bottom at Bull Creek, this road has steep rutted inclines and several switchbacks. The road is often cut into the side of steep cliffs. This stretch is sharply eroded with washouts, and there are precious few places to turn around, if the traveler decides he has had enough.

As for the old freight trail that went upstream from the mouth of Cow Creek, there is no longer any road to speak of in the first 15 miles. The multiple creek crossings of the old Cow Creek trail have been eroded away into cut banks, and the gravel bars where the wagons crossed have been swept down stream. Here and there the remnants of the old Cow Creek Trail can be observed along Cow Creek but it is sketchy. Upper Cow Creek is not so isolated. About 15 miles up from the Missouri, where Davidson Coulee flows into Cow Creek, Blaine County Road 330 (Cow Creek Trail) drops down Davidson ridge to Cow Creek Bottom from the west. One ranch is located near this point. The name &quot;Cow Island Trail&quot; is still applied to the road that goes from the junction of Cow Creek and Davidson Coulee up to the bench and on to the west, and this is probably the same route that the original Cow Island freight trail followed as it went on to Ft. Benton. Above Davidson Coulee Cow Creek is paralleled by Blain County Road 314 (Birdtail Road) for about . In the upper reaches of Cow Creek a County road (Birdtail Road) descends to a second ranch. Blaine County Road 300 crosses Cow Creek at it upper end, near the forks of West and East Cow Creek, just under the southern flank of the Bears Paw Mountains.

Most of the roads in the breaks are simply dirt roads. Only a few are graveled. Dirt roads in the Cow Creek area (as well as most of the Missouri Breaks) can be traversed only with extreme difficulty (if at all) when wet. The breaks are partially eroded from clays of the Cretaceous formations which contain bentonite. When wet the surface of these clays becomes slick and then becomes &quot;gumbo&quot; which clings to and builds up on tires, wheels, feet and hooves. If caught on dirt roads in the breaks by rain the best (and sometimes the only) course is to simply wait till the surface dries out.

==Notes==
The journal of Lewis for May 26, 1805, states:
&quot;Our hunters had killed two of the Bighorned Animals since I had left them. we also passed another creek [Cow Creek] a few miles below Turtle Creek on the Stard. 30 yds in width which also had running water bed rocky. (we called it Windsor Cr.) late this evening we passed a very bad rapid which reached quite across the river, [NB: water deep channel narrow gravel &amp;c. on each side] the party had considerable difficulty in ascending it although they doubled their crews and used both the rope and the pole. While they were passing this rapid a female Elk and its fawn swam down through the waves which ran very high, hence the name of Elk rapids which they instantly gave this place, these are the most considerable rapids which we have yet seen on the Missouri and in short the only place where there has appeared to be a sudden descent.&quot; Windsor Creek became known as Cow Creek. for it to be 30 yards wide, it had to be in flood from snow melt in the Bearpaws. The rapids referred as Elk rapids became known as Bird rapids, and along with Cabin rapids, Dauphine rapids, and Deadman rapids they formed a barrier to steamboat travel in low water that caused Cow Island landing at Cow Creek to become the low water landing where freight was transferred to wagon trains for the final leg to Ft. Benton.

The Cretaceous shale which make up the surface of the breaks contain Ammonite fossils. Ammonites are an extinct form of the subclass Cephalopod. Fossil Ammonites have a disc like shape. In this area they commonly range from tiny up to about across. A Moby Dick of Ammonite fossils – one about across or larger – was identified by Shell Oil Company geologists engaged on a field survey in the Cow Creek area in the late 1950s. They did not mark the site on their maps, and never had an opportunity to return. The siting was at a remote spot on Cow creek or one of its tributaries, but in the breaks. Since it would take a crane to lift this monster, a heavy truck to haul it, and reasonably good roads to move it, this lost giant Ammonite fossil probably still awaits re-discovery on Cow Creek.

<doc id="534044" wikidata="Q33634" url="?curid=534044" title="Kalmyk Oirat">
<text>Kalmyk Oirat (, &quot;Haľmg Öördin keln&quot;, ), commonly known as the Kalmyk language (, &quot;Haľmg keln&quot;, ), is a variety of the Mongolian language, natively spoken by the Kalmyk people of Kalmykia, a federal subject of Russia. In Russia, it is the standard form of the Oirat Mongolian (based on the Torgut dialect), which belongs to the Mongolic language family. The Kalmyk people of the Northwest Caspian Sea of Russia claim descent from the Oirats from Eurasia, who have also historically settled in Mongolia and Northwest China. According to UNESCO, the language is &quot;definitely endangered&quot;. According to the Russian census of 2021, there are 110,000 speakers out of an ethnic population consisting of 178,000 people.

==History==
Kalmyk is now only spoken as a native language by a small minority of the Kalmyk population. Its decline as a living language began after the Kalmyk people were deported en masse from their homeland in December 1943, as punishment for limited Kalmyk collaboration with the Nazis. Significant factors contributing to its demise include: (1) the deaths of a substantial percentage of the Kalmyk population from disease and malnutrition, both during their travel and upon their arrival to remote exile settlements in Central Asia, south central Siberia and the Soviet Far East; (2) the wide dispersal of the Kalmyk population; (3) the duration of exile, which ended in 1957; (4) the stigma associated with being accused of treason, and (5) assimilation into the larger, more dominant culture. Collectively, these factors discontinued the intergenerational language transmission.

In 1957, the Soviet government reinstated the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast and later reestablished the Autonomous Republic of Kalmykia. The Kalmyk people were permitted to return to the Republic in 1957, 14 years after exile. The Russian language, however, was made the official language of the Republic, and Sovietisation was imposed on the Kalmyk people, leading to drastic cuts in Kalmyk language education. The Cyrillic alphabet became firmly established among the Kalmyks (and other peoples, too). For instance, books, periodicals, newspapers, etc., were published using it. By the late 1970s, the Russian language became the primary language of instruction in all schools in the Republic.

During the period of Perestroika, Kalmyk linguists, in collaboration with the Kalmyk government, planned and tried to implement the revival of the Kalmyk language. This revival was seen as an integral part of the reassertion of Kalmyk culture. In an important symbolic gesture, the Kalmyk language was declared an official language of the Republic, giving it equal status with the Russian language with respect to official governmental use and language education.

During the production of the film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, sound designer Rafe Mercieca—with his life-time partner Ben Curtis—based the language of the Ewoks on Kalmyk after hearing it spoken in a documentary and being impressed with its phonology.

==Geographic distribution==
The majority of Kalmyk language speakers live in the Republic of Kalmykia, where it is an official language. A small group of Kalmyk language speakers also live in France and the US, but the use of Kalmyk is in steep decline. In all three locations, the actual number of speakers is unknown. Kalmyk is an endangered language.

As of 2012, the Kalmyk community in New Jersey, which arrived in the US in the 1950s, was planning to work with the Enduring Voices project to promote Kalmyk language and culture.

==Linguistic classification==
From a synchronic perspective, Kalmyk is the most prominent variety of Oirat. It is very close to the Oirat dialects found in Mongolia and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, both phonologically and morphologically. The differences in dialects, however, concern the vocabulary, as the Kalmyk language has been influenced by and has adopted words from the Russian language and various Turkic languages.

Two important features that characterise Kalmyk are agglutination and vowel harmony. In an agglutinative language, words are formed by adding affixes to existing words, called stem words or root words. Prefixes, however, are not common in Mongolic. Vowel harmony refers to the agreement between the vowels in the root of a word and the vowels in the word&#x27;s suffix or suffixes. Other features include the absence of grammatical gender.

It has some elements in common with the Uralic and Uyghur languages, which reflects its origin from the common language of the Oirats, a union of four Oirat tribes that absorbed some Ugric and Turkic tribes during their expansion westward.

==Phonology==
Similar to Middle Mongol and Written Oirat, Kalmyk exhibits tongue-root vowel harmony. Unlike Middle Mongol, however, consonants are not restricted by harmony. For instance, the voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ can appear in both front and back vowel words, e.g. һәәвһә /ɣæːwɣæ/ &quot;good&quot; and һалун /ɣalun/ &quot;goose&quot;. Nonetheless, all consonants and neutral reduced vowel /ə/ are influenced by harmonic status of a word, at least phonetically. The harmonic vowel pairs are: /a/~/æ/, /o/~/ø/, /u/~/y/, ~, the last pair being allophonic.

Historical long vowels in non-initial syllables have been reduced to short vowels, while historical short vowels have been reduced to schwa and then, just like in Mongolian, were replaced according to language&#x27;s phonotactics. For example, Written Oirat &quot;ɣarān&quot; &quot;hand-&quot; became һаран /ɣaran/; &quot;ɣarɣaqsan&quot; &quot;to get out--&quot; became һарһсн /ɣarɣsən/. Long vowels and diphthongs in one-syllable words have been also reduced to short vowels: &quot;sayin&quot; &quot;good&quot; &gt; сән /sæn/. Nevertheless, in inflected forms of such words, short vowels tend to become elongated: сән /sæn/ &quot;good&quot; &gt; сәәг /sæːgə/ &quot;good-&quot;, күн /kyn/ &quot;man&quot;&gt; күүнә /kyːnæ/ &quot;man-&quot;. Despite that, long vowels still may be pronounced in non-initial syllables. This happens if a word consists of three syllables, second of which has a vowel /a/ or /æ/, and third syllable has a reduced vowel /ə/. Examples include гөрәсн [gøræːsᵊn] &quot;saiga&quot;, туршарт [turʃaːrtə] &quot;during&quot;, кезәңк [kezæːŋkə] &quot;a while ago&quot;, һазрас [ɢazraːsə] &quot;land-&quot;.

===Consonants===

The following is an outline of the consonant system of Kalmyk. Note that since virtually all speakers of Kalmyk are bilingual, recent borrowings from Russian do not undergo phonological adaptation and are pronounced according to the rules of Russian phonology, including those of vowel reduction and stress.

* The voiceless labiodental fricative /f/ occurs only in loanwords and onomatopoeic terms;
* The voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ may also be released as a uvular plosive in the word-initial position as well as uvular fricative in any position, including initial;
* The voiceless velar fricative /x/ may also be pronounced as uvular ;
* The voiced labial approximant /w/ may be released as the voiced bilabial fricative [β];
* The velar nasal /ŋ/ is often pronounced with a velar plosive or at the end, e.g. дөң [døŋk] &quot;help&quot;, саң [saŋk] &quot;treasury&quot;, маңна [maŋgna] &quot;forehead&quot;.

===Vowels===

* Note that the mid central vowel /ə/ is not orthographically written;
* The open back vowel is also phonetically central ;
* The (historically reduced) vowel /ə/ is phonetically released as in harmonically front-vowel words, as in back-vowel words, and as after palatal and post-alveolar consonants /nʲ tʲ dʲ t͡ɕ d͡ʑ ʃ lʲ j/;
* Although not always manifested orthographically, is a back vowel word allophone of /i/ that is only present in hortative, genitive and accusative suffixes;
* In native words, vowels /o oː/ and /ø øː/ can only appear in word-initial syllables.

===Devoicing and assimilation===
Orthographic voiced stops d, g are devoiced: келәд /kelæt/ &quot;to speak-&quot;, бөлг /bølək/ &quot;chapter&quot;. Devoicing also occurs whenever there is a two-consonant cluster with one consonant being voiceless: /bolʃko/ &quot;may not&quot;, таңһч /taŋxt͡ɕə/ &quot;republic&quot;. Consonant clusters exhibit other types of assimilation:
# /kx/, /gx/, /xx/ &gt; /kk/, /kk/, /xk/: закх /zakxə~zakkə/ &quot;to order&quot;; өргх /ørkxə~ørkkə/ &quot;to raise&quot; хатхх /xatxxə~xatxkə/ &quot;to poke&quot;;
# /n/ + /b/ &gt; /mb/: кен /ken/ &quot;who&quot; + б /bə/ &quot;&quot; &gt; кемб /kembə/ &quot;who-&quot;;
# /w/ + /n/ &gt; /mn/: тәв- /tæv-/ &quot;to put&quot; + /-næ/ &quot;&quot; &gt; тәмнә /tæmnæ/ &quot;to put-&quot;;
# /w/ + voiceless consonant &gt; /p/: ав- /awə/ &quot;to take&quot; + чк /t͡ɕkə/ &quot;&gt; апчк /apt͡ɕkə/ &quot;to put-&quot;;
# /t͡ɕ/ + /l/ or /t/ &gt; /ʃl/, /ʃt/: көвүчлх /køvyt͡ɕəlxə/ &gt; көвүшлх /køvyʃəlxə/ &quot;to adopt&quot;, ачтн /at͡ɕtən/ &gt; аштн /aʃtən/ &quot;to load-&quot; ;
# /n/ &gt; /ŋ/ before consonants /ɣ, g, x, k, s/: Written Oirat &quot;sonosxu&quot; &quot;to listen&quot; &gt; соңсх /soŋksxə/, түрүн /tyryn/ &quot;first&quot; + к /kə/ &quot;&quot; &gt; түрүңк /tyryŋkə/ &quot;first-&quot;;
# /l/ is palatalised to /lʲ/ before palatal affricates /t͡ɕ d͡ʑ/: болҗ /bolʲd͡ʑə/ &quot;to become-&quot;.

The voiced bilabial stop /b/, being only restricted to word-initial position, may be pronounced as in a phrase: келҗ бәәнә /kelʲd͡ʑə bæːnæ/ &gt; [kelʲd͡ʑ βæːnæ] &quot;to speak- to be-&quot;.

The labial approximant or fricative /w/ can be pronounced as:
# Close rounded vowel or in past tense inflection: кел- /kelʲ-/ &quot;to say&quot; + -в /w/ &quot; + -в /w/ &quot; &gt; келүв /kelyw/ &quot;I said&quot; or in consonant clusters: тарвс /tarvəs/ &gt; тарус /tarus/ &quot;watermelon&quot; 
#Voiced bilabial stop [b] in past tense inflection, if the verb stem ends in /-w/: ав- /aw-/ &quot;to take&quot; + -в /-w/ &quot;&quot; &gt; /awbə/ &quot;took&quot;.

===Vowel reduction and phonotactics===
Word-initial syllable structure is (C)V(C), meaning that in native words no word-initial clusters can occur. For non-initial syllables, however, a syllable-initial cluster of up to four consonants is allowed, meaning the maximal syllable is CCCCVC. In some consonant clusters such as /tl tn dn dl/ a sonorant becomes syllabic. These clusters are also nasally released.

The reduced vowel /ə/ is regularly preserved and can be a syllable nucleus in the following cases:
# In a word-final position: ик /i.kə/ &quot;big&quot;, арат /a.ra.tə/ &quot;fox&quot;, чон /t͡ɕo.nə/ &quot;wolf&quot;;
# If, word-finally, there is either a closed syllable or a final open syllable with a consonant cluster: эцкнр /et͡s.kə.nər/ &quot;father-&quot; келчксн /kelʲ.t͡sək.sən/ &quot;to say--&quot; соңсгдна /soŋk.sə.gdna/ &quot;to hear--&quot;;
# In closed non-final syllables of a multisyllabic word: шорһлҗн /ʃor.ɣəlʲ.d͡ʑən/ &quot;ant&quot;, әәмшгтә /æ:m.ʃək.tæ/ &quot;dangerous&quot;;
# Word-finally in the following affixes:
## Ablative -ас /-asə/;
## Accusative -иг /-igə/, -г /-gə/;
## Adjective suffix -к /-kə/;
## Completive -чк /-t͡ɕkə/;
## Imperfective converb, admirative and evidential suffix -җ /-dʑə/;
## Dative -д /-də/;
## Negation particle эс /esə/;
## Present tense negation particle (or suffix) биш, -ш /biʃə/ /-ʃə/;
## Future tense participle -х /-xə/.

On the other hand, the vowel /ə/ cannot form syllables on its own if the following is true:
# If the following syllable is open: бичх /bi.t͡ɕxə/ &quot;to write&quot;, өгх /øk.kxə/ &quot;to give&quot;;
# In inflections of two-syllable words, if the second syllable of an inflected word has a non-reduced vowel, e.g. мөрн /mørən/ &quot;horse&quot; &gt; мөрта mørtæ &quot;with a horse&quot;, церг /t͡se.rək/ &quot;army&quot; &gt; церглә /t͡serglæ/ &quot;with an army&quot;;
# If the following syllable is open and has non-reduced vowel: тоһрун */to.ɣə.run/ &gt; /to.ɣrun/ &quot;grus&quot;; шамдһа */ʃam.də.ɣa/ &gt; /ʃam.dɣa/ &quot;sneaky&quot;. In this case, however, reduced syllables may be released phonetically, although they do not play a role in syllable forming.;

Two-syllable words with schwa as a nucleus of the second syllable may undergo metathesis, thus creating an open syllable: Written Oirat &quot;oros&quot; &quot;Russian&quot; &gt; /orəs/ &gt; /orsə/; &quot;ulus&quot; &quot;country, people&quot; &gt; /uləs/ &gt; /ulsə/; &quot;oyirad&quot; &quot;Oirat&quot; &gt; /øːrət/ &gt; /øːrdə/.

===Stress===
Kalmyk exhibits non-phonemic stress with the last syllable (even if it ends in schwa) being stressed.

==Grammar==
Like other Mongolic languages, Kalmyk is an agglutinative, suffixing, and a genderless language. Some aspects of its syntax have been influenced by Russian; for example, relative clauses, traditionally characterized by left-branching and employing a converbial form of a verb (similarly to Japanese), now often use Russian relative pronoun and thus exhibit right-branching. Other noticeable feature possibly influenced by Russian is frequent usage of future participle as a predicate of a sentence to express future tense. There is little to none suppletion (irregular forms) in verbal inflection and noun conjugation

===Nouns===
Traditionally, Kalmyk cases are said to have three declensions; however, this is mostly due to orthographical peculiarities. Basically, if the word ends in a full vowel and the case ending begins in a vowel, either (1) a prothetic /g/ or /ʁ/ is added or (2) a vowel is deleted from the case ending. This is further demonstrated in the table below.
* Genitive takes the suffix -ин () in case it is preceded by a consonant; -һин () or -н () if it is preceded by a vowel; -ә (), -a or -и () if it is preceded by the /n/ consonant. 
* Dative suffix is -т () if preceded by voiced stops /b/ (/β/) /d/ /g/, voiceless sibilants /s/ /ʃ/, and /r/
* Accusative is marked (with a suffix) if the object is definite, unmarked if the object is indefinite
* Nouns ending in -n declense differently. -n is subtracted in the accusative, instrumental, and comitative cases. In all other cases, it is left untouched. For example: kelʲən &quot;language-&quot; kelʲnæ &quot;language-&quot; kelʲəndə &quot;language-&quot; kelʲə/kelʲigə &quot;language-&quot; kelʲnæsə &quot;language-&quot; kelʲær &quot;language-&quot; kelʲtæ &quot;language-&quot; kelʲnyr &quot;language-&quot;
* Dative also bears the function of lative and locative cases. Its difference with the directive case is not clear, and in some dialects, dative is the prevailing case for lative usage.

==Writing systems==
The literary tradition of Oirat reaches back to 11th century when the Old Uyghur script was used. The official Kalmyk alphabet, named Clear Script or &quot;Todo bichig&quot; in Oirat, was created in the 17th century by a Kalmyk Buddhist monk called Zaya Pandita.

Like the Old Mongolian script, Todo bichig was written from top to bottom. Written Oirat language contained many words borrowed from the Mongolian language and not used in everyday speech, despite many attempts to bring the written standard and colloquial spoken language closer together. Thus, already at the beginning of the 18th century, two written forms of the Kalmyk language were recorded - “bookish”, used in religious practice and having numerous Mongolian and Tibetan borrowings and preserving archaic language forms, as well as “conversational”, used in private correspondence and reflecting the changes taking place in the language.

Todo bichig, also called “zayapandit script” after its creator, existed among the Kalmyks until 1924 with minor changes. Oirats of China use it to the present.

In 1924 this script was replaced by an adaptation of the Cyrillic script, which was abandoned in 1930 in favour of a Latin script.

===Early Cyrillic alphabets===
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, the Orthodox Missionary Society published a number of school books in the Kalmyk language, using Cyrillic script. The first edition of this kind was the &quot;Primer for Kalmyk ulus schools&quot; (1892). The alphabet used in this primer has the following composition: А а, Б б, В в, Г г, Д д, Е е, З з, И и, К к, Л л, М м, Н н, О о, П п, Р р, С с, Т т, У у, Х х, Ц ц, Ч ч, Ш ш, ь, Э э, Ю ю, Я я, Ӓ ӓ, Ā ā, Ǟ ǟ, Ӧ ӧ, Ō ō, Ȫ ȫ, Ӱ ӱ, Ӯ ӯ, Ӱ̄ ӱ̄, Дж дж, Нг нг, Ій, ій, Йе йе, Йӧ йӧ, Ӓй ӓй, Ӣ ӣ, Э̄ э̄, Ю̄ ю̄, Я̄ я̄. In 1902, the “Primer for Kalmyks” was released, where a different version of the alphabet was used: А а, Б б, Г г, Д д, З з, И и, Й й, К к, Л л, М м, Н н, О о, Р р, С с, Т т, У у, Х х, Ц ц, Ч ч, Ш ш, ь, Э э, Ӓ ӓ, Ā ā, Ǟ ǟ, Ӧ ӧ, Ō ō, Ȫ ȫ, Ӱ ӱ, Ӯ ӯ, Ӱ̄ ӱ̄, Дж дж, Ҥ ҥ, Ӣ ӣ, Э̄ э̄. At the same time, the letter of the clear script continued to be used.

On January 6, 1924, a meeting of the Kalmyk public was held in Astrakhan. At this meeting, the majority of the votes had declared obsolete writing - it was noted that it was difficult for writing and learning, lack of fonts, the inability to use on the telegraph, and so on. In this regard, it was decided to translate Kalmyk language into Cyrillic script. On January 12, the alphabet was adopted, consisting of the following letters: А а, Б б, В в, Г г, Д д, Е е, Ж ж, З з, И и, К к, Л л, М м, Н н, О о, П п, Р р, С с, Т т, У у, Ф ф, Х х, Ц ц, Ч ч, Ш ш, Щ щ, Ы ы, Э э, Ю ю, Я я, Ь ь, Й й, ä, ö, ӱ, ң, ӝ. Above the long vowels was supposed to put a line (macron), but in practice this was not done. Also, despite the absence of an approved project, the letter ъ was used to designate unclear vowels. From January 1926, the newspaper «Ulan Halmg» (ru) began to be printed on this alphabet. The basis of the emerging Kalmyk literary language was the Torgut dialect, but later the norm began to focus not only on the Torgut, but also on the Derbet dialect. Sometimes in the editions of that time, the letter &quot;ң&quot; was replaced by ҥ or н̈, and the letters &quot;Е е, Ж ж, Ф Ф, Щ щ&quot; were not officially included in the alphabet.

September 7, 1926 at a meeting at the Kalmyk pedagogical school in Astrakhan, it was decided to make changes to the alphabet. So, all additional letters were canceled, and instead of them entered D d, V v, H h. In June 1927, this alphabet was introduced into official use, but much of the literature and press was still published in the alphabet of 1924.

On February 5–8, 1928, a regular meeting on Kalmyk writing was held, at which the alphabet was reformed again. The letters &quot;D d, V v, H h&quot; were canceled, and the letter Ә ә was entered to indicate unclear vowels. It was decided to denote the long vowels by doubling the corresponding letters. This alphabet was used until 1930.

=== Latin alphabet ===
In the late 1920s, the process of romanization of writing began in the USSR. In the course of this process in January 1930, the IX Kalmyk Regional Congress of Soviets legalized the new Latinized alphabet of the Kalmyk language. Its actual use began in newspapers from the end of September of the same year. In this alphabet, the letters were arranged in the following order: A a, B b, C c, Ç ç, D d, E e, Ә ә, G g, H h, I i, j, K k, L l, M m, N n, Ꞑ ꞑ, O o, Ө ө, P p, R r, S s, Ş ş, F f, Y y, Z z, Ƶ ƶ, U u, T t, V v, X x, ь.

On January 10–17, 1931, at a conference held in Moscow, scientists of the Mongolian group of peoples decided to change the phonetic meaning of the two letters of the Kalmyk script, as well as change the alphabetical order of the letters. In May of the same year, the III Kalmyk Regional Conference on Language and Writing, which was held in Elista, confirmed this decision. The alphabet took the following form:

The letter &quot;Ь ь&quot;, unlike most other Soviet Latinized alphabets, denoted palatalization. In this form, the alphabet existed until 1938.

There is no romanization standard for Kalmyk, but a modified version of either the BGN/PCGN romanization of Russian or the Common Turkic Alphabet is used in practice.

=== Modern Cyrillic alphabet ===
In the second half of the 1930s, the USSR began the process of translating scripts into Cyrillic. The Latin script was in turn replaced by another Cyrillic script in 1938. Initially, the Kalmyk Cyrillic alphabet included all the letters of the Russian alphabet, as well as Ä ä, Гъ гъ, Дж дж, Нъ нъ, Ö ö, Ӱ ӱ. In 1941, the alphabet was reformed again - the outline of additional letters was changed. However, due to the deportation of the Kalmyks that followed soon, the transition to a new version of the alphabet was carried out only after their rehabilitation - in the late 1950s. These script reforms effectively disrupted the Oirat literary tradition.

The modern Cyrillic alphabet used for the Kalmyk language is as follows:
Since the Tatar alphabet is identical to the Kalmyk alphabet (both featuring the same additional letters to the Russian one), Kalmyks using Windows use Tatar keyboard layouts to type Kalmyk. Kalmyk-specific keyboard layouts, however, are available on Android and Linux systems.

== Alphabet matching table ==

* Pronounced /je/ at the beginning of words and /e/ otherwise. Only appears at the beginning of a word in Russian loanwords.&lt;br&gt;
** This sound combination exists in native Kalmyk words, but is spelled &quot;йо&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
*** Only appears at the beginning of words.

<text>Garden State Plaza (officially Westfield Garden State Plaza) is a shopping mall located in Paramus, in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Owned and managed by Paris-based real estate management company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, the mall is situated at the intersection of Route 4 and Route 17 near the Garden State Parkway, about west of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Opened in 1957 as the first suburban shopping mall in New Jersey, it has 300 stores and of leasable space, ranked in 2022 as the 16th-largest shopping mall in the United States and qualifying it as a super-regional mall according to the standards of the International Council of Shopping Centers.

The mall had sales of $775 per square foot in 2013, almost 75% above the national average. In a study of malls in the United States performed on behalf of CNBC, published in 2018, Garden State Plaza ranked ninth in the nation, based on sales of $950 per square foot. Most of the mall, especially retail outlets, is closed on Sunday in accordance with state and local blue laws. Since April 2023, minors under the age of 18 are required to have an adult over 21 supervise them on Friday and Saturday nights.

In a borough where half of the property tax revenue comes from retail properties, Garden State Plaza accounts for 10% of the property taxes collected in Paramus.

As of August 2022, its anchors are Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and AMC Theatres.

==History==
The site at the southwest corner of Route 4 and Route 17 that would become Garden State Plaza was next to a drive-in theater dating back to the 1930s. Allied Stores and Macy&#x27;s had discussed a shared project at the site that was abandoned in August 1953, after which Allied Stores pursued development of the Bergen Mall (since renamed as Bergen Town Center), that would be located a mile away on Route 4 and which was scheduled to open in September 1957 with Stern&#x27;s as its anchor store.

R.H. Macy announced the creation of Garden State Plaza in May 1954, establishing a subsidiary that would own and operate the mall. JC Penney announced in June 1955 that the company would construct an standalone three-story building as part of the project, with the infrastructure to add a fourth floor, as needs grew. Constructed by the Muscarelle Construction Company for owner/developer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. as an open-air shopping &quot;plaza&quot;, total construction costs for the mall were $26 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Garden State Plaza opened on May 1, 1957, as the first suburban mall in New Jersey, with plans to be &quot;the largest in the state&quot;. On opening day, Garden State Plaza had 75,000 shoppers at a mall that was anchored by a Bamberger&#x27;s store on three floors and included 60 retail stores and 5,500 parking spaces on a site that covered . The formal ribbon cutting ceremony included the mayor of Paramus Fred C. Galda and a local eight-year-old who cut a ribbon with one thousand dimes as a fundraiser for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (since renamed as the March of Dimes), part of an awareness campaign to encourage people to get the polio vaccine.

Its original anchor store was Bamberger&#x27;s. In September 1957, the Fifth Avenue women&#x27;s clothing store Russeks opened a women&#x27;s wear store in the Shopping Center. Gimbels and JCPenney were both added the following year in 1958. In September 1958, long-time Macy&#x27;s rival Gimbel&#x27;s announced that it was acquiring access to a building site in the mall for a facility that would include of retail space on three floors, with completion expected in 1960. It was called &quot;the largest shopping center in the world.&quot; 

Garden State Plaza drew much business from nearby New York towns and cities, whose shoppers wandered across state lines to take advantage of New Jersey&#x27;s lower sales taxes and its policy that exempted clothing purchases from sales tax. By 1961, it was the world&#x27;s largest mall.

In 1975, the mall began a multi-phased, years-long project that would fully enclose the mall, converting exterior passageways into covered spaces. The project, budgeted at $20 million, would add of retail space, bringing the total to upon completion.

A $21 million construction project in 1981 converted access tunnels into a second level for the mall, added of retail space.

The mall was enclosed between 1981 and 1984 in response to competitive pressure from newer fully enclosed malls such as the Willowbrook Mall in nearby Wayne. Later in the 1980s, a lower level was added by converting a former basement truck tunnel into retail space. The existing JCPenney basement was given a new entrance on the lower level, but since the floors were at slightly different elevations, that entrance features the shortest escalator in North America, at a height of six steps.

In 1987, Gimbels&#x27; parent company, BATUS, which had been selling off its Gimbels&#x27; stores, sold its Garden State Plaza location to Associated Dry Goods. Associated reopened the store as the new headquarters for its Hahne&#x27;s department stores. Hahne&#x27;s had previously been headquartered at its flagship store in downtown Newark, which the company wanted to close. In the mid-1990s, a Nobody Beats the Wiz store was added as an out-parcel to the mall site; it later became a Best Buy store that closed in 2018. The site was then occupied by a toy store called Toy City, owned by Party City.

On September 7, 1990, Nordstrom opened a $37 million, , three-level store constructed on the former Gimbel&#x27;s/Hahne&#x27;s site. In 1991, the luxury department store chain Lord &amp; Taylor opened a store in the mall, which was its seventh in the state at the time.

In 1996, Garden State Plaza completed a $200 million expansion and major remodeling project that added more than of retail space and a pair of four-level parking structures, Parking Garage A, and Parking Garage B. The downstairs food court was connected to the lower level from the previous expansion. JCPenney grew by , and two new anchors were added, a Neiman Marcus on three levels and a Lord &amp; Taylor on two levels, both targeted at the upscale fashion-conscious shopper. A Venetian carousel was also added at that time of the expansion and remodeling and was located in front of Macy&#x27;s. The carousel closed in 2016, and was removed so that the mall could use that space for performances by the Bergen Performing Arts Center.

Westfield acquired the mall in 1986 from Macy&#x27;s in a deal that also included New Jersey&#x27;s Brunswick Square Mall and Quaker Bridge Mall.
The Borough of Paramus petitioned the New Jersey Supreme Court to review a decision by borough&#x27;s Planning Board, asking it to review the plans to construct a &quot;entertainment lifestyle precinct&quot; at the mall that included a 16-screen AMC movie theater and 10 specialty retail stores, along with a parking lot below the new wing, known as &quot;Parking Garage C&quot;. The petition was turned down, and the mall celebrated its 50th anniversary with the new expansion and stores opened on May 25, 2007.

In 2013, the mall rebuilt Parking Garage B, expanding it to five levels and 1,800 parking spaces. Adjacent were built a new guest services office and a valet lounge. A year later, the mall added a wing at a cost of $160 million known as the &quot;Fashion District&quot; that has 22 stores and restaurants.

In January 2018, Best Buy announced that they would be shuttering their two-level store at Garden State Plaza and would be relocating to a single-floor building to be constructed at The Outlets at Bergen Town Center nearby. The store officially moved on April 14, 2018. JCPenney closed in March 2018. Both stores are expected to be redeveloped by Westfield in the future, though as of October 2018, no such development has been announced. Westfield Garden State Plaza announced plans to build a mixed development center in the previous JCPenney outpost.

In July 2019, Tru Kids announced that one of two Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores being opened by that company as part of that toy retailer&#x27;s recovery from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017 and its acquisition by Tru Kids, would be at Garden State Plaza. (The other would be opened at The Galleria in Houston.) Eschewing the &quot;warehouse&quot; arrangement of previous stores, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores, these revamped versions were much smaller, and centered around open play areas, interactive displays and areas for special events and birthday parties. It opened on November 27, 2019. However it closed on January 28, 2021.

In September 2019, the mall announced that it would developing mixed-use projects with dining and other retail on the ground floors of the buildings and housing on the upper floors, which would be constructed in areas now covered by parking lots on the periphery of the mall. Construction of this housing would count towards the borough&#x27;s affordable housing obligations and would serve as a downtown &quot;town square&quot; for Paramus.

In August 2020, Lord &amp; Taylor announced that its location in Garden State Plaza would be one of six remaining stores in the state that would be closed, as part of an overall shutdown of the chain&#x27;s retail operations.

In April 2023, the mall announced it would closely align with similar policies adopted by many other malls nationally, banning visitors under 18 without a parent or guardian from the building on weekends, effective the end of that month (except for its AMC location and onsite restaurants, leading some local residents to question the effectiveness of the policy).

==Blue laws==
Due to New Jersey state blue laws that only apply in Bergen County and more restrictive limitations in place in Paramus restricting business on Sunday, Garden State Plaza is almost completely closed on Sundays, except for some of the restaurants and the movie theater, all of which have special Sunday entrances. On Sundays, Garden State Plaza&#x27;s parking lot is accessible only from the Route 4 and Route 17 access points. Gates are down so that the access roads from the secondary streets are blocked. The Paramus Borough Code forbids the performance of any &quot;worldly employment&quot; on Sunday, with very limited exceptions. These laws were enacted shortly after Garden State Plaza opened, out of fear that the mall would cause high levels of traffic congestion on the highways in the borough. During the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie issued an executive order that suspended the state&#x27;s blue laws, allowing stores to be open on Sunday, November 4, 2012, for the benefit of those severely affected by flooding and/or power outages caused by the hurricane. A week later, after public outcry that included the mayor of Paramus announcing that the borough would continue to enforce its own restrictions, the state&#x27;s blue laws were put back into effect.

==Public transportation==
Westfield Garden State Plaza serves as a local transportation hub. The mall is served by NJ Transit bus lines routes 163, 171, 175, 707, 709, 756, 758 and 770.

==Incidents==

On November 4, 2013, 20-year-old Richard Shoop, armed with a SIG 556R semi-automatic rifle, fired multiple shots in the mall. Customers and employees were evacuated immediately from the mall premises shortly after the shots were fired and the mall was on lockdown for hours. The mall remained closed the following day. No one was injured or killed, other than Shoop himself, who committed suicide.

== Popular culture ==
* Garden State Plaza is the setting for Tricia Sullivan&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Maul&quot; (2002). The novel takes its title from the way that the word &quot;mall&quot; is pronounced with the New Jersey accent. In the novel, three teenage girls start a shoot out with a local gang.
* Several episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the HBO mob drama were filmed at the mall, which was called the &quot;Paramus Mall&quot;. 
* The 2005 &quot;Sesame Street&quot; direct-to-video special &quot;All Star Alphabet&quot;, featuring Stephen Colbert and Nicole Sullivan, was filmed on location at the mall.

<doc id="534057" wikidata="Q177033" url="?curid=534057" title="Triple bond">
<text>A triple bond in chemistry is a chemical bond between two atoms involving six bonding electrons instead of the usual two in a covalent single bond. Triple bonds are stronger than the equivalent single bonds or double bonds, with a bond order of three. The most common triple bond is in a nitrogen N2 molecule; the second most common is that between two carbon atoms, which can be found in alkynes. Other functional groups containing a triple bond are cyanides and isocyanides. Some diatomic molecules, such as diphosphorus and carbon monoxide, are also triple bonded. In skeletal formulae the triple bond is drawn as three parallel lines (≡) between the two connected atoms.

==Bonding==
Triple bonding can be explained in terms of orbital hybridization. In the case of acetylene, each carbon atom has two sp-orbitals and two p-orbitals. The two sp-orbitals are linear, with 180° bond angles, and occupy the x-axis in the cartesian coordinate system. The p-orbitals are perpendicular to the sp-orbitals on the y-axis and the z-axis. When the atoms approach each other, the sp orbitals overlap to form an sp-sp sigma bond. At the same time the pz-orbitals approach and together they form a pz-pz pi-bond. Likewise, the other pair of py-orbitals form a py-py pi-bond. The result is formation of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.

In the bent bond model, the triple bond can also formed by the overlapping of three sp3 lobes without the need to invoke a pi-bond.

==Triple bonds between elements heavier than oxygen==

Many elements beyond oxygen can form triple bonds. These bonds are common in some transition metals. Hexa(tert-butoxy)ditungsten(III) and Hexa(tert-butoxy)dimolybdenum(III) are well known examples, in which the metal-metal bond distance is about 233 pm. Hexa(tert-butoxy)ditungsten(III) has attracted particular attention for its reactions with alkynes, leading to metal-carbon triple bonded compounds of the formula RC≡W(OBut)3

Additionally, phosphorus can exist as the highly reactive diatomic molecule diphosphorus, which has roughly half the bond-dissociation energy of dinitrogen.

<text>James Francis Aloysius McIntyre (June 25, 1886 – July 16, 1979) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Los Angeles from 1948 to 1970, and was created a cardinal in 1953. He was a highly successful builder of new parishes, churches, and schools. He was notable in Church politics, and his reputation remains highly controversial.

==Early life==
James McIntyre was born in Manhattan to James and Mary (née Pelly) McIntyre. His father was a native of New York City and member of the mounted police, and his mother was from Kiltormer, County Galway, Ireland. McIntyre attended Public School No. 70 because there was no room for him at the local parochial school.

His father was rendered an invalid after falling from his horse in Central Park and sustaining serious injuries; his mother then opened a dressmaking business to support the family. Following his mother&#x27;s death in 1896, McIntyre and his father were taken into the nearby home of a relative. He did not attend high school, instead becoming an errand boy in the financial market. He attended night school at Columbia University and City College.

At age 16, McIntyre became a runner on the New York Stock Exchange, working for the brokerage firm of H.L. Horton &amp; Co. He was offered a junior partnership at Horton in 1914, but declined in order to pursue Holy Orders. He then studied at Cathedral College for a year before entering St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers where he was a friend of Patrick O&#x27;Boyle.

==Priesthood==
McIntyre was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Patrick Hayes on May 21, 1921. He then served as assistant pastor of St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church in the Lower East Side until 1923, whence he became assistant chancellor for the Archdiocese of New York. He was promoted to chancellor in 1934, and named Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness, Pius XI on December 27 of that year. Appointed a Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius XI on November 12, 1936.

Following the appointment of Francis Spellman to Archbishop of New York in 1939, McIntyre was named to the archdiocesan board of consultors. In 1939, he formed the Columbiettes, a Knights of Columbus women&#x27;s auxiliary.

==Episcopate==

===New York===
On November 16, 1940, McIntyre was appointed auxiliary bishop of New York and titular bishop of &quot;Cyrene&quot; by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on January 8, 1941, from Archbishop Spellman, with Stephen Donahue and John O&#x27;Hara serving as co-consecrators, in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. He became vicar general of the archdiocese on January 27, 1945, and received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in May 1946. He once said that accounts of anti-Semitism in New York were &quot;a manufactured movement...for the deliberate purpose of besmirching the minority Catholic population.&quot;

On July 20, 1946, McIntyre was named coadjutor bishop of New York and titular archbishop of &quot;Paltus&quot;. Despite never succeeding Spellman as archbishop, he assisted in the governance of the archdiocese while Spellman was busied by his additional duties as Apostolic Vicar for the Military Forces. Spellman once said, &quot;I have never undertaken any important matter without consulting [McIntyre]. In nothing have I gone contrary to his advice.&quot; In 1947, McIntyre spoke out against legislation that would &quot;permit further encroachments on the parental function of education.&quot;

===Los Angeles===
McIntyre was appointed the second archbishop of Los Angeles, California, on February 7, 1948. Replacing the late John J. Cantwell, he was installed at St. Vibiana&#x27;s Cathedral on the following March 19. In McIntyre&#x27;s first four years alone, 26 new parishes, 64 parochial schools, and 18 high schools were established. At one point during his tenure, he oversaw the construction of a new church every 66 days and a new school every 26 days to accommodate the post-World War II population boom. As archbishop, he led the successful effort to repeal the state tax on Catholic schools. In 1967 he consulted with California Governor Ronald Reagan regarding a proposed law to legalize abortion. He convinced Reagan to veto the law if it allowed abortions in case of birth defects. The legislature dropped that provision and Reagan signed the law, which decriminalized abortions when done to protect the health of the mother.

Pius XII created him Cardinal Priest of &quot;Santa Anastasia&quot; in the consistory of January 12, 1953. McIntyre was the first cardinal of the Western United States. At the consistory, when the official photographer&#x27;s flash bulb failed to go off when the biretta was conferred, Pius and McIntyre re-enacted the ceremony. McIntyre was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1958 papal conclave, and again in the 1963 papal conclave.

He sent his priests to meetings of the right-wing John Birch Society to educate themselves about communism, and recommended subscriptions to &quot;American Opinion&quot; and other Birch publications in his diocesan newspaper. He expressed caution towards &quot;an obvious trend toward laxity&quot; in the morality of films, and was one of the American bishops to oppose the liturgical revision of the Second Vatican Council, in which he participated from 1962 to 1965.

Cardinal McIntyre resisted elements in the church who dissented from Church dogma. He suspended Father William DuBay, who had called for McIntyre&#x27;s removal in 1964 for not sufficiently supporting the civil rights movement, after DuBay advocated a labor union for Catholic priests and published a book critical of the Catholic Church hierarchy. When Bishop James P. Shannon expressed views critical of the Church hierarchy in an NBC documentary in the late 1960s, McIntyre described Shannon&#x27;s views as constituting &quot;incipient schism.&quot;

He had a dispute with the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, whom he barred from teaching within the archdiocese in 1967 for their leftist tendencies and abandonment of their traditional discipline—such as eliminating the habit and compulsory daily prayer. The dispute was appealed to the Holy See, which stipulated that the sisters must either restore their former practices or request dispensation from their vows; 315 of the 380 members sought dispensation and formed a non-Catholic organization.

At the end of his tenure, he was the subject of protests by blacks, Hispanics, and his own clergy. John Cooney writes that McIntyre harbored racial prejudices and was approached privately by the priests of his archdiocese who asked him to refrain from making racial slurs.As the result of rule changes by Pope Paul VI he lost, on January 1, 1971, the right to participate in a Papal conclave due to being over the age of 80. 

He retired after 21 years as Archbishop on January 21, 1970, and then served as a parish priest at St. Basil&#x27;s Church in Downtown Los Angeles, where he privately celebrated the Tridentine Mass on the side altars of St. Basil&#x27;s.

McIntyre died at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, at the age of 93. In 2003, his remains were transferred to the crypt of the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.

==Reputation==
McIntyre was disliked by liberal elements within the American Church. Charles Morris in his book &quot;American Catholic&quot; states:Today, McIntyre&#x27;s name is associated mostly with his sad, slightly ridiculous octogenarian flailing against the cultural and religious revolutions of the 1960s. But if he had retired at the canonical age of 75 in 1961...he would be remembered as one of the great builders of the American Church.Monsignor Francis Weber, in his two-volume biography of McIntyre, tries to rehabilitate the cardinal&#x27;s reputation. In a review of Weber&#x27;s book, historian Kevin Starr agrees with Weber and articulates the alternative version of McIntyre and the 1960s. Starr writes:Sadly, this kindly (most of the time) and, in his own way, holy prelate became the scapegoat for those pushing the ecclesial revolutions, so frequently self-destructive, of the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council.

<text>FairTax is a fixed rate sales tax proposal introduced as bill H.R. 25 in the United States Congress every year since 2005. The &quot;Fair Tax Act&quot; calls for elimination of the Internal Revenue Service and repeal the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. H.R. 25 would eliminate all federal income taxes (including the alternative minimum tax, corporate income taxes, and capital gains taxes), payroll taxes (including Social Security and Medicare taxes), gift taxes, and estate taxes, replacing federal taxes with a single consumption tax levied on retail sales.

The &quot;Fair Tax Act&quot; (/) would apply a fixed rate sales tax at the point of sale on all new, final goods and services purchased for household consumption. The proposal also specifies a monthly payment made to all households based on household size. Called a &quot;prebate,&quot; the monthly payment offsets the regressive nature of a sales tax up to the poverty level. First introduced into the United States Congress in 1999, a number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the bill; however, it did not move from committee. A campaign in 2005 for the FairTax proposal involved Leo E. Linbeck and the Fairtax.org. Talk radio personality Neal Boortz and Georgia Congressman John Linder published &quot;The FairTax Book&quot; in 2005 and additional visibility was gained in the 2008 presidential campaign.

As defined in the proposed legislation, the initial sales tax rate is 30% (i.e. a purchase of $100 would incur a sales tax of $30, resulting in a total price to the consumer of $130). Advocates promote this as a 23% &quot;tax inclusive&quot; rate based on the total amount paid including the tax, which is the method currently used to calculate income tax liability. In subsequent years the rate could adjust annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year. With the rebate taken into consideration, the FairTax would be progressive on consumption, but would still be regressive on income (since consumption as a percentage of income falls at higher income levels). Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the tax burden on high-income earners and increase it on the lower class earners. Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax wealth, increase purchasing power and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.

Advocates expect a consumption tax to increase savings and investment, ease tax compliance and increase economic growth, increase incentives for international business to locate in the US and increase US competitiveness in international trade. The plan would provide transparency for funding the federal government. Supporters believe it would increase civil liberties, benefit the environment, and effectively tax illegal activity and undocumented immigrants. Critics contend that a consumption tax of this size would be extremely difficult to collect, would lead to pervasive tax evasion, and raise less revenue than the current tax system, leading to an increased budget deficit. The proposed Fairtax might cause removal of tax deduction incentives, transition effects on after-tax savings, incentives on credit use and the loss of tax advantages to state and local bonds. It also includes a sunset clause if the 16th Amendment to the US Constitution is not repealed within seven years of its enactment.

==Legislative overview and history==

The legislation would remove the Internal Revenue Service (after three years), and establish Excise Tax and Sales Tax bureaus in the Department of the Treasury. The states are granted the primary authority for the collection of sales tax revenues and the remittance of such revenues to the Treasury. The plan was created by Americans For Fair Taxation, an advocacy group formed to change the tax system. The group states that, together with economists, it developed the plan and the name &quot;Fair Tax&quot;, based on interviews, polls, and focus groups of the general public. The FairTax legislation has been introduced in the House by Georgia Republicans John Linder (1999–2010) and Rob Woodall (2011–2014), while being introduced in the Senate by Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss (2003–2014).

Linder first introduced the &quot;Fair Tax Act&quot; () on July 14, 1999, to the 106th United States Congress and a substantially similar bill has been reintroduced in each subsequent session of Congress. The bill attracted a total of 56 House and Senate cosponsors in the 108th Congress, 61 in the 109th, 76 in the 110th, 70 in the 111th, 78 in the 112th, 83 in the 113th (/), 81 in the 114th (/), 51 in the 115th (/), 33 in the 116th (), and 30 in the 117th (). Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (Republican) had cosponsored the bill in the 109th–110th Congress, but it has not received support from the Democratic leadership. Democratic Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Democratic Senator Zell Miller of Georgia cosponsored and introduced the bill in the 108th Congress, but Peterson has left the House of Representatives and Miller has left the Senate. In the 109th–111th Congress, Representative Dan Boren was the only Democrat to cosponsor the bill. A number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the FairTax, but it has not moved from committee since its introduction in 1999. The legislation was also discussed with President George W. Bush and his Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson.

To become law, the bill will need to be included in a final version of tax legislation from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the President. In 2005, President Bush established an advisory panel on tax reform that examined several national sales tax variants including aspects of the FairTax and noted several concerns. These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report. The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the 2008 presidential election on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill. A poll in 2009 by Rasmussen Reports found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds. President Barack Obama did not support the bill, arguing for more progressive changes to the income and payroll tax systems. President Donald Trump proposed to lower overall income taxation and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.

==Tax rate==
The sales tax rate, as defined in the legislation for the first year, is 23% of the total payment including the tax ($23 of every $100 spent in total—calculated similar to income taxes). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total, or $30 on top of every $100 spent—$130 total). After the first year of implementation, this rate is automatically adjusted annually using a predefined formula reflecting actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.

The effective tax rate for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate that are used to rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level. The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending were equally reduced.

===Sales tax rate===
During the first year of implementation, the FairTax legislation would apply a 23% federal retail sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent in total (sometimes called &quot;tax-inclusive&quot;, and presented this way to provide a direct comparison with individual income and employment taxes which reduce a person&#x27;s available money &quot;before&quot; they can make purchases). The equivalent assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional U.S. state sales taxes (sometimes called &quot;tax-exclusive&quot;; this rate is not directly comparable with existing income and employment taxes). After the first year of implementation, this tax rate would be automatically adjusted annually using a formula specified in the legislation that reflects actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.

===Effective tax rate===

A household&#x27;s effective tax rate on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on taxable items and the fixed monthly tax rebate. The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household&#x27;s effective rate to zero or below. The lowest effective tax rate under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below poverty level spending for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household&#x27;s effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate. The total amount of spending and the proportion of spending allocated to taxable items would determine a household&#x27;s effective tax rate on consumption. If a rate is calculated on income, instead of the tax base, the percentage could exceed the statutory tax rate in a given year.

===Monthly tax rebate===

Under the FairTax, family households of lawful U.S. residents would be eligible to receive a &quot;Family Consumption Allowance&quot; (FCA) based on family size (regardless of income) that is equal to the estimated total FairTax paid on poverty level spending according to the poverty guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The FCA is a tax rebate (known as a &quot;prebate&quot; as it would be an advance) paid in twelve monthly installments, adjusted for inflation. The rebate is meant to eliminate the taxation of household necessities and make the plan progressive. Households would register once a year with their sales tax administering authority, providing the names and social security numbers of each household member. The Social Security Administration would disburse the monthly rebate payments in the form of a paper check via U.S. Mail, an electronic funds transfer to a bank account, or a &quot;smartcard&quot; that can be used like a debit card.

Opponents of the plan criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute estimated the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett has argued that the rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would constitute a welfare payment regardless of need.

The President&#x27;s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform cited the rebate as one of their chief concerns when analyzing their national sales tax, stating that it would be the largest entitlement program in American history, and contending that it would &quot;make most American families dependent on monthly checks from the federal government&quot;. Estimated by the advisory panel at approximately $600 billion, &quot;the Prebate program would cost more than all budgeted spending in 2006 on the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior combined.&quot; Proponents point out that income tax deductions, tax preferences, loopholes, credits, etc. under the current system was estimated at $945 billion by the Joint Committee on Taxation. They argue this is $456 billion more than the FairTax &quot;entitlement&quot; (tax refund) would spend to cover each person&#x27;s tax expenses up to the poverty level. In addition, it was estimated for 2005 that the Internal Revenue Service was already sending out $270 billion in refund checks.

===Presentation of tax rate===

Sales and income taxes behave differently due to differing definitions of tax base, which can make comparisons between the two confusing. Under the existing individual income plus employment (Social Security; Medicare; Medicaid) tax formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed (known as &quot;tax-inclusive&quot;). If an individual&#x27;s gross income is $100 and the sum of their income plus employment tax rate is 23%, taxes owed equals $23. Traditional state sales taxes are imposed on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good&#x27;s price (known as &quot;tax-exclusive&quot;). A good priced at $77 with a 30% sales tax rate yields $23 in taxes owed. To adjust an inclusive rate to an exclusive rate, divide the given rate by one minus that rate (i.e. formula_1 ).

The FairTax statutory rate, unlike most U.S. state-level sales taxes, is presented on a tax base that includes the amount of FairTax paid. For example, a final after-tax price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Although no such requirement is included in the text of the legislation, Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total. The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23% of the total. Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). The plan&#x27;s opponents call the semantics deceptive. FactCheck called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate. Bruce Bartlett stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate, and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes. Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher.

===Revenue neutrality===

A key question surrounding the FairTax is whether the tax has the ability to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.

A 2006 study published in &quot;Tax Notes&quot; by the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University and Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff estimated the FairTax would be revenue-neutral for the tax year 2007 at a rate of 23.82% (31.27% tax-exclusive). The study states that purchasing power is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments. To recapture the lost revenue, state and local governments would have to raise tax rates or otherwise change tax laws in order to continue collecting the same real revenues from their taxpayers. The Argus Group and Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics each published an analysis that defended the 23% rate. While proponents of the FairTax concede that the above studies did not explicitly account for tax evasion, they also claim that the studies did not altogether ignore tax evasion under the FairTax. These studies presumably incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations by using National Income and Product Account based figures, which is argued to understate total household consumption. The studies also did not account for capital gains that may be realized by the U.S. government if consumer prices were allowed to rise, which would reduce the real value of nominal U.S. government debt. Nor did these studies account for any increased economic growth that many economists researching the plan believe would occur.

In contrast to the above studies, William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution published a study in &quot;Tax Notes&quot; that estimated a rate of 28.2% (39.3% tax-exclusive) for 2007 assuming full taxpayer compliance and an average rate of 31% (44% tax-exclusive) from 2006 to 2015 (assumes that the Bush tax cuts expire on schedule and accounts for the replacement of an additional $3 trillion collected through the Alternative Minimum Tax). The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10% due to tax evasion, tax avoidance, and/or legislative adjustments, the average rate would be 34% (53% tax-exclusive) for the 10-year period. A dynamic analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that a 28% (38.9% tax-exclusive) rate would be revenue neutral for 2006. The President&#x27;s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform performed a 2006 analysis to replace the individual and corporate income tax with a retail sales tax and estimated the rate to be 25% (34% tax-exclusive) assuming 15% tax evasion, and 33% (49% tax-exclusive) with 30% tax evasion. The rate would need to be substantially higher to replace the additional taxes replaced by the FairTax (payroll, estate, and gift taxes). Beacon Hill Institute, FairTax.org, and Kotlikoff criticized the President&#x27;s Advisory Panel&#x27;s study as having allegedly altered the terms of the FairTax, using unsound methodology, and/or failing to fully explain their calculations.

==Taxable items and exemptions==
The tax would be levied once at the final retail sale for personal consumption on new goods and services. Purchases of used items, exports and all business transactions would not be taxed. Also excluded are investments, such as purchases of stock, corporate mergers and acquisitions and capital investments. Savings and education tuition expenses would be exempt as they would be considered an investment (rather than final consumption).

A good would be considered &quot;used&quot; and not taxable if a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect or if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good, which may be different from the item being sold previously. Personal services such as health care, legal services, financial services, and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would renting apartments and other real property. Food, clothing, prescription drugs, and medical services would be taxed. (State sales taxes generally exempt these types of basic-need items in an effort to reduce the tax burden on low-income families. The FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions.) Internet purchases would be taxed, as would retail international purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States (collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection).

==Distribution of tax burden==


The FairTax&#x27;s effect on the distribution of taxation or tax incidence (the effect on the distribution of economic welfare) is a point of dispute. The plan&#x27;s supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base, that it would be progressive, and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth (reducing the economic gap). Opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. A person earning $2 million a year could live well spending $1 million, and as a result pay a mere 11% of that year&#x27;s income in taxes. Households at the lower end of the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving. Therefore, according to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).

Income earned and saved would not be taxed until spent under the proposal. Households at the extreme high end of consumption often finance their purchases out of savings, not income. Economist Laurence Kotlikoff states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable, and argues that taxing consumption is effectively the same as taxing wages plus taxing wealth. A household of three persons (this example will use two adults plus one child; the rebate does not consider marital status) spending $30,000 a year on taxable items would devote about 3.4% of total spending ([$6,900 tax minus $5,888 rebate]/$30,000 spending) to the FairTax after the rebate. The same household spending $125,000 on taxable items would spend around 18.3% ([$28,750 tax minus $5,888 rebate]/$125,000 spending) on the FairTax. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact and the rate approaches 23% of total spending. Thus, according to economist Laurence Kotlikoff, the effective tax rate is progressive on consumption.

An unreviewed paper by Kotlikoff and David Rapson states that the FairTax would significantly reduce marginal taxes on work and saving, lowering overall average remaining lifetime tax burdens on current and future workers. A study by Kotlikoff and Sabine Jokisch concluded that the long-term effects of the FairTax would reward low-income households with 26.3% more purchasing power, middle-income households with 12.4% more purchasing power, and high-income households with 5% more purchasing power. The Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax would make the federal tax system more progressive and would benefit the average individual in almost all expenditures deciles. In another study, they state the FairTax would offer the broadest tax base (an increase of over $2 trillion), which allows the FairTax to have a lower tax rate than current tax law.

Gale analyzed a national sales tax (though different from the FairTax in several aspects) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle-income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the top 1% would drop. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax may have a negative effect on the well-being of mid-income earners for several years after implementation. According to the President&#x27;s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform report, which compared the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces) to a sales tax with rebate, the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000–$50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%. The report states that the top 5% of earners would see their burden decrease from 58.6% to 37.4%. FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive payroll tax (a 15.3% total tax not included in the Tax Panel study; payroll taxes include a 12.4% Social Security tax on wages up to $97,500 and a 2.9% Medicare tax, a 15.3% total tax that is often split between employee and employer) greatly changes the tax distribution, and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle-class workers.

==Predicted effects==
The predicted effects of the FairTax are a source of disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to &quot;Money&quot; magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would have a positive effect on economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).

===Economic===

Americans For Fair Taxation states the FairTax would boost the United States economy and offers a letter signed by eighty economists, including Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith, that have endorsed the plan. The Beacon Hill Institute estimated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, real wages by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%. Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics projected the economy as measured by GDP would be 2.4% higher in the first year and 11.3% higher by the 10th year than it would otherwise be. Economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Sabine Jokisch reported the incentive to work and save would increase; by 2030, the economy&#x27;s capital stock would increase by 43.7% over the current system, output by 9.4%, and real wages by 11.5%. Economist John Golob estimates a consumption tax, like the FairTax, would bring long-term interest rates down by 25–35%. An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy indicated that the plan would generate significant overall macroeconomic improvement in both the short and long-term, but warned of transitional issues.

FairTax proponents argue that the proposal would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning a large share of money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters argue that the U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.

Opponents point to a study commissioned by the National Retail Federation in 2000 that found a national sales tax bill filed by Billy Tauzin, the &quot;Individual Tax Freedom Act&quot; (), would bring a three-year decline in the economy, a four-year decline in employment and an eight-year decline in consumer spending. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of supply-side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money. John Linder states an estimated $11 trillion is held in foreign accounts (largely for tax purposes), which he states would be repatriated back to U.S. banks if the FairTax were enacted, becoming available to U.S. capital markets, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States. Attorney Allen Buckley states that a tremendous amount of wealth was already repatriated under law changes in 2004 and 2005. Buckley also argues that if the tax rate was significantly higher, the FairTax would discourage the consumption of new goods and hurt economic growth.

===Transition===

During the transition, many or most of the employees of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.

In the period before the FairTax is implemented, there could be a strong incentive for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.

Individuals under the current system who accumulated savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a Roth IRA or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved under the current system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and &quot;hidden taxes&quot; embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be &quot;taxed&quot; a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.

===Other indirect effects===

The FairTax would be tax free on mortgage interest up to the federal borrowing rate for like-term instruments as determined by the Treasury, but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes. An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the housing sector since the investment would no longer be tax-favored. In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately among the various types of charitable organizations. The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds. Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through environmental economics and the re-use and re-sale of used goods. Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate. Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process.

If the FairTax bill were passed, permanent elimination of income taxation would not be guaranteed; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing tax code, but the Sixteenth Amendment would remain in place. Preventing new legislation from reintroducing income taxation would require a repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution with a separate provision expressly prohibiting a federal income tax. This is referred to as an &quot;aggressive repeal&quot;. Separate income taxes enforced by individual states would be unaffected by the federal repeal. Passing the FairTax would require only a simple majority in each house of the United States Congress along with the signature of the President, whereas enactment of a constitutional amendment must be approved by two thirds of each house of the Congress, and three-quarters of the individual U.S. states. It is therefore possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another taxation system. If a new income tax bill were passed after the FairTax passage, a hybrid system could develop; albeit, there is nothing preventing a bill for a hybrid system today. To address this issue and preclude that possibility, in the 111th Congress John Linder introduced a contingent sunset provision in H.R. 25. It would require the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment within 8 years after the implementation of the FairTax or, failing that, the FairTax would expire. Critics have also argued that a tax on state government consumption could be unconstitutional.

==Changes in the retail economy==
Since the FairTax would not tax used goods, the value would be determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.

===Value of used goods===
Since the FairTax would not tax used goods, some critics have argued that this would create a differential between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, it is argued that like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.

===Theories of retail pricing===

Based on a study conducted by Dale Jorgenson, proponents state that production cost of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22% on average after embedded tax costs are removed, leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes. The study concludes that producer prices would drop between 15% and 26% (depending on the type of good/service). Jorgenson&#x27;s research included all income and payroll taxes in the embedded tax estimation, which assumes employee take-home pay (net income) remains unchanged from pre-FairTax levels. Price and wage changes after the FairTax would largely depend on the response of the Federal Reserve monetary authorities. Non-accommodation of the money supply would suggest retail prices and take home pay stay the same—embedded taxes are replaced by the FairTax. Full accommodation would suggest prices and incomes rise by the exclusive rate (i.e., 30%)—embedded taxes become windfall gains. Partial accommodation would suggest a varying degree in-between.

If businesses provided employees with gross pay (including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes), Arduin, Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics estimated production costs could decrease by a minimum of 11.55% (partial accommodation). This reduction would be from the removal of the remaining embedded costs, including corporate taxes, compliance costs, and the employer share of payroll taxes. This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices, which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario. Bruce Bartlett states that it is unlikely that nominal wages would be reduced, which he believes would result in a recession, but that the Federal Reserve would likely increase the money supply to accommodate price increases. David Tuerck states &quot;The monetary authorities would have to consider how the degree of accommodation, varying from none to full, would affect the overall economy and how it would affect the well-being of various groups such as retirees.&quot;

Social Security benefits would be adjusted for any price changes due to FairTax implementation. The Beacon Hill Institute states that it would not matter, apart from transition issues, whether prices fall or rise—the relative tax burden and tax rate remains the same. Decreases in production cost would not fully apply to imported products; so according to proponents, it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade (see Border adjustability). To ease the transition, U.S. retailers will receive a tax credit equal to the FairTax on their inventory to allow for quick cost reduction. Retailers would also receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs, which amounts to around $5 billion.

==Effects on tax code compliance==
One avenue for non-compliance is the black market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.

Other economists and analysts have argued that the underground economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.

===Tax compliance and evasion===

Proponents state the FairTax would reduce the number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing complexity to a simplified state sales tax form. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection. Under the FairTax, the federal government would be able to concentrate tax enforcement efforts on a single tax. Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs. In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses. Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses (&quot;Big-Box&quot; retailers). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies. In the service sector, approximately 80% of sales are made by 1.2% of U.S. businesses.

The FairTax is a national tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states&#x27; own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, which is more than the $327 million budget for the state&#x27;s sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.

FairTax opponents state that compliance decreases when taxes are not automatically withheld from citizens, and that massive tax evasion could result by collecting at just one point in the economic system. Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see higher evasion rates. Economist Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service found studies showing that evasion rates of sales taxes are often above 10%, even when the sales tax rate is in the single digits. Tax publications by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), IMF, and Brookings Institution have suggested that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10% before incentives for evasion become too great to control. According to the GAO, 80% of state tax officials opposed a national sales tax as an intrusion on their tax base. Opponents also raise concerns of legal tax avoidance by spending and consuming outside of the U.S. (imported goods would be subject to collection by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection).

Economists from the University of Tennessee concluded that while there would be many desirable macroeconomic effects, adoption of a national retail sales tax would also have serious effects on state and local government finances. Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if the states did not conform to the FairTax, they would have massive confusion and complication as to what is taxed by the state and what is taxed by the federal government. In addition, sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles—Bartlett suggests that the state may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax. University of Michigan economist Joel Slemrod argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. &quot;Even at an average rate of around five percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer.&quot; University of Virginia School of Law professor George Yin states that the FairTax could have evasion issues with export and import transactions. The President&#x27;s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform reported that if the federal government were to cease taxing income, states might choose to shift their revenue-raising to income. Absent the Internal Revenue Service, it would be more difficult for the states to maintain viable income tax systems.

===Underground economy===
Opponents of the FairTax argue that imposing a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground and create a vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses may be able to manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller&#x27;s certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).

While many economists and tax experts support a consumption tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax rather than a value added tax (VAT). A VAT imposes a tax on the value added at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer with much of the tax already in the price. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good&#x27;s tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer&#x27;s tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in &quot;tax arbitrage&quot; by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer. Citing evasion, Tim Worstall wrote in &quot;Forbes&quot; that Europe&#x27;s 20-25% consumption taxes simply would not work if they were a sales tax: that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re all a VAT. Laurence Kotlikoff has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via 1099-type forms, their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT. In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.

===Personal versus business purchases===
Businesses would be required to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return. During audits, the business would have to produce invoices for the &quot;business purchases&quot; that they did not pay sales tax on, and would have to be able to show that they were genuine business expenses. Advocates state the significant 86% reduction in collection points would greatly increase the likelihood of business audits, making tax evasion behavior much more risky. Additionally, the FairTax legislation has several fines and penalties for non-compliance, and authorizes a mechanism for reporting tax cheats to obtain a reward. To prevent businesses from purchasing everything for their employees, in a family business for example, goods and services bought by the business for the employees that are not strictly for business use would be taxable. Health insurance or medical expenses would be an example where the business would have to pay the FairTax on these purchases. Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non-profit or religious organization &quot;for business purposes&quot; would not be taxable.

==FairTax movement==
 The creation of the FairTax began with a group of businessmen from Houston, Texas, who initially financed what has become the political advocacy group Americans For Fair Taxation (AFFT), which has grown into a large tax reform movement. This organization, founded in 1994, claims to have spent over $20 million in research, marketing, lobbying, and organizing efforts over a ten-year period and is seeking to raise over $100 million more to promote the plan. AFFT includes a staff in Houston and a large group of volunteers who are working to get the FairTax enacted.

In 2007 Bruce Bartlett said the FairTax was devised by the Church of Scientology in the early 1990s, drawing comparisons between the tax policy and religious doctrine from the faith, whose creation myth holds that an evil alien ruler known as Xenu &quot;used phony tax inspections as a guise for destroying his enemies.&quot; Representative John Linder told the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; that Bartlett confused the FairTax movement with the Scientology-affiliated Citizens for an Alternative Tax System, which also seeks to abolish the federal income tax and replace it with a national retail sales tax. Leo Linbeck, AFFT Chairman and CEO, stated &quot;As a founder of Americans For Fair Taxation, I can state categorically, however, that Scientology played no role in the founding, research or crafting of the legislation giving expression to the FairTax.&quot;

Much support has been achieved by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz&#x27;s book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled &quot;The FairTax Book&quot;, explains the proposal and spent time atop &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates his share of the proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather&#x27;s Pizza Herman Cain had promoted the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but has never been close to winning a seat in any election.

<doc id="534061" wikidata="Q7729832" url="?curid=534061" title="The Desperate Dan Book">
<text>The Desperate Dan books, featuring the comic book character Desperate Dan, were published in 1954, 1978, 1990, 1991 and 1992. Since they were traditionally released in the autumn and in time for Christmas, all bar the first (which had no date) had the date of the following year on the cover.

Although not a Desperate Dan Annual, a book celebrating his 60th birthday was released in 1997 called The Legend of Desperate Dan (60 years of classic cartoon art). It featured a history of the strip, and reprints of strips from 1937 to 1967.

==Covers==
*The Dandy&#x27;s Desperate Dan featured Dan&#x27;s face in the middle, surrounded by four pictures of him doing things like bending a lamppost.
*The Desperate Dan Book 1979 featured Dan shaving his stubble with a blowtorch and meat cleaver.
*The Desperate Dan Book 1991 (from The Dandy) featured Dan wearing 4 costumes- a cowboy costume, an Indian chief costume, a gambler costume and an outlaw costume. Underneath was an envelope featuring a normally dressed Dan on the stamp, saying &quot;If you want me on a Cactusville stamp, it&#x27;s got to be the real me!&quot;
*The Desperate Dan Book 1992 featured Dan eating cow pie, surrounded by small aliens. Speaking to the aliens, he was saying &quot;Ain&#x27;t seen you around Cactusville before-care for a piece of cow-pie?&quot;
*The Desperate Dan Book 1993 featured 4 pictures of Dan posing on a bearskin. The first was from when he was 6 months old, the second from when he was 2 years old, the third from when he was 4 years old, and the fourth from today. In the fourth picture, the bearskin is saying &quot;You&#x27;re a mite heavy for posin&#x27; on me now, Dan!&quot;
*The Legend of Desperate Dan (60 years of classic cartoon art) featured Dan looking into a mirror while shaving his stubble with a blowtorch.

<doc id="534064" wikidata="Q528994" url="?curid=534064" title="Roosevelt Field (shopping mall)">
<text>Roosevelt Field is a shopping mall in the East Garden City section of Uniondale, New York. It is the largest shopping mall on Long Island, the second-largest in the state of New York (after Destiny USA), and the eighth-largest shopping mall in the United States.

Designed by architect I. M. Pei, Roosevelt Field Mall is managed by Simon Property Group. It is the second most successful mall in the state. Major retailers at the mall include Primark, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, and Neiman Marcus.

==Location==

Roosevelt Field is located adjacent to the Meadowbrook State Parkway, making it accessible from the Northern State Parkway and the Southern State Parkway. It is a major bus hub for Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE), with several bus routes stopping in a terminal area near the mall&#x27;s southern parking structure.

The mall was constructed on the site of (and is named for) Roosevelt Field – an airport and military airfield where Charles Lindbergh began his historic trans-Atlantic flight. At one time, a plaque at the north end of the mall (in the hall that now connects Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods and JCPenney) marked the spot where Lindbergh took off. It was later moved near the Disney Store, but was removed during a renovation to the mall in the 2010s.

==History==

As an airfield, the land served as the take-off site of many famous aviators such as Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post. Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo transatlantic flight took off from Roosevelt Field in 1927. The field was originally named Hazelhurst Field and was renamed in honor of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s son, Quentin, who died in World War I. After the airfield was closed in 1951, the site was developed by New York&#x27;s William Zeckendorf and designed by I. M. Pei.

Ground was broken on the $35 million project in April 1955. The center opened with a single level and was an open-air center. It included a Woolworth five-and-dime store, a Walgreens drug store, a Food Fair supermarket, a Buster Brown shoe store, a public auditorium, a movie theater, and an outdoor ice rink. The original anchor of the mall was a 3-level 320,000 ft² (31,900 m²) Macy&#x27;s, which opened on August 29, 1956.

In 1962, a 250,000 ft² (2,320 m²) Gimbels store opened. Today, the structure houses Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods and Primark. With the addition, the complex held over 1,000,000 ft² (92,900 m²). A major extension was completed in 1964. Macy&#x27;s had an 85,000 ft² (7,900 m²) third level added. In 1968, The Century Roosevelt Cinema began operation. At that time, the mall was enclosed.

In 1971, a 3-level, 260,000 ft² (24,200 m²) Alexander&#x27;s was completed. In 1972, a 3-level 259,000 ft² (2,900 m²) J.C. Penney was added which was later completely renovated in 2010.

An upper level of stores and food court was established in 1993 after a major renovation which started in 1991. When Alexander&#x27;s went bankrupt in 1992, Abraham &amp; Straus gutted the building and extensively renovated it, opening in 1992. As such, Roosevelt Field had as anchors the three department stores - Macy&#x27;s, Abraham &amp; Straus and Stern&#x27;s - during the first half of the 1990s. The Abraham &amp; Straus location only lasted until 1995, when the chain became defunct. The store was slightly renovated, and re-opened as a Bloomingdale&#x27;s in 1995. The Bloomingdale&#x27;s store at Roosevelt Field had a major renovation, which was finished by the summer of 2009. 

The former Gimbels anchor was a Stern&#x27;s between 1987 and 2001. After Stern&#x27;s closed, the spot was taken over by Galyan&#x27;s, which opened in 2003 (later bought out by Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods in 2004). Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods occupied the eastern section and Bloomingdale&#x27;s Furniture Gallery, which opened in 2004, occupied the western half until closing in 2019. A new, 3-story Nordstrom and a 2-story wing leading to the new Nordstrom opened in August 1997. Simon Property Group took ownership of the mall in 1998, when it acquired Corporate Property Investors.

In March 2012, it was announced that a new 100,000-square-foot building anchored by luxury department store Neiman Marcus would be added to Roosevelt Field. Opened on February 19, 2016, this expansion created room for even more shops leading up to the luxury department store and was accompanied by a new parking structure. During the renovation of the mall in 2015, the glass elevators in the center were removed to create a play area and new elevators were built to replace them. Simon had discovered that the scenic elevators had to be removed due to severe hydraulic oil leakage.

On November 17, 2022, Ireland-based retailer Primark opened its first Long Island store at the mall, in the space which had previously been occupied by Bloomingdale&#x27;s Furniture Gallery.

By 2023, Roosevelt Field had announced several newer additions, among them are Brilliant Earth, Rudsak, TYR, Kendra Scott, Primark, Savage X Fenty, Warby Parker, TAG Heuer, Armani Exchange, Offline by Aerie, and the return of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

<text>Gerhart Eisler (20 February 1897 – 21 March 1968) was a German politician, editor and journalist. Along with his sister Ruth Fischer, he was a very early member of the Austrian German Communist Party (KPDÖ) and then a prominent member of the Communist Party of Germany during the Weimar Republic.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Eisler was born in Leipzig, the son of Marie Edith Fischer and Rudolf Eisler, a professor of philosophy at Leipzig but of Austrian nationality. His father was Jewish and his mother was Lutheran.

His brother was the leftist composer Hanns Eisler and his sister was Communist activist Ruth Fischer. In November 1918, Eisler returned from the front of World War I and joined the Austrian Communist Party under the influence of his older sister. In 1919, he married Hede Massing (1900–1981). In 1920, he followed his sister to Berlin, where in January 1921 he became associate editor of the &quot;Die Rote Fahne&quot;. It was Germany&#x27;s leading left-wing newspaper.

=== Comintern agent ===

He left Hede in 1923 for her sister Elli Tune. Elli left him with their baby daughter Natasha in 1933, when she could no longer cope with the demands the Comintern made on him. In 1937, he met Hilde Vogel-Rothstein and they married in Queens, New York City in 1942. His first wife Hede and her third husband Paul Massing both spied for the Soviet Union in the USA and they all kept in touch. Hede Massing later turned towards the FBI and testified against Alger Hiss in his second trial.

Massing saw Eisler on his return to the Soviet Union: &quot;Gerhart… was involved in the Wittdorf affair, a political maneuver to dethrone Ernst Thälmann, who was supported by Stalin…. Gerhart was, after a time, in complete isolation in Moscow, forbidden to read German papers in order to get Germany out of his system, and then sent as Comintern representative to China where, according to many reports, he achieved great success through his ruthless policy. He stepped back into Stalin&#x27;s favor.&quot;

From 1929 to 1931, he was a liaison between the Communist International and the Communist Parties in China and then from 1933 to 1936 to the United States. &quot;Time&quot; reported in 1947 that he had made a trip to China in the late 1920s during which he earned the name &quot;the executioner&quot; for &quot;purging the party of spies and dissidents&quot;.

Eisler was charged in two trials in 1947 first with refusing to answer the HUAC, then of violating U.S. laws by misrepresenting his Communist Party affiliation on his immigration application. He was sentenced to one and three years in prison, but was soon released on bail. &quot;Newsweek&quot; described him in its 23 February 1948 issue as the &quot;number one Red agent&quot; (echoing &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;No. I U.S. Communist&quot; from 1947).).

=== Escaping America ===
In 1948, Lee Pressman of New York and Joseph Forer of Washington, DC, represented Eisler along with Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union; Irving Potash, vice president of the Fur and Leather Workers Union; Ferdinand C. Smith, secretary of the National Maritime Union; and John Williamson, labor secretary of the CPUSA. On 5 May 1948, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

When his last legal appeal failed, he jumped bail and secretly boarded the Polish liner MS &quot;Batory&quot; bound for London in early May 1949. He was discovered by the crew only after the ship was at sea. Once in England, he was dragged off the ship by his hands and feet; the authorities allowed him to leave for the German Democratic Republic.

=== Senior East German official ===
Eisler became an employee of the party executive of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and a member of the People&#x27;s Chamber. In the course of the establishment of the SED rule, he informed his colleagues at the party executive committee meeting on October 4, 1949 that, as Marxists, they must know: “If we found a government, we will never give it up again, neither through elections nor through others Methods&quot;. Until 1953 he was responsible for the management of the press and radio in the GDR government. Because of sympathizing with the opponents of SED party leader Walter Ulbricht before and during the uprising on June 17, 1953, he was deposed, but rehabilitated in 1955.

From 1956 to 1962 Eisler was deputy chairman and then until his death chairman of the State Committee for Broadcasting of the GDR, and from 1967 he was a member of the Central Committee of the SED. There he was one of the most innovative leading figures in the GDR media apparatus: for example, he set up the DT 64 youth studio, which he also protected from attacks from the party, during his time.

==Legacy==

After his death during an official visit in Yerevan, Armenia, several schools and streets in the German Democratic Republic were named in his honor. His cremation urn was placed at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin. Files from the UK National Archives released on 4 March 2008 included information about Gerhart Eisler. The MI5 summary states:Eisler, who was supposed by many to be the covert leader and director of the Communist Party in America during and after the Second World War, became the centre of a diplomatic incident in 1949 when, having stowed away on a Polish ship out of New York, he was forcibly removed and arrested in Southampton. This file documents the Security Service&#x27;s involvement in the case. The earliest traces of Eisler in the file (KV 2/2773, 1936–1949) date from 1936, when Comintern efforts to secure a false American passport in the name of Edwards were reported. In 1947 information obtained from Eisler&#x27;s former wife, Hedwiga Messing, suggested that Eisler had used this cover name in New York in 1934. 

An allegation from former Communist Louis F. Budenz that Lillian Hellman hosted a dinner party for Eisler the night before he stowed away on the &quot;Batory&quot; was instrumental in labeling her an active Communist and in the subsequent dismissal of John F. Melby from the U.S. State Department in 1953.

<doc id="534079" wikidata="Q37642" url="?curid=534079" title="Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
The timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites charts the progress of the discovery of new bodies over history. Each object is listed in chronological order of its discovery (multiple dates occur when the moments of imaging, observation, and publication differ), identified through its various designations (including temporary and permanent schemes), and the discoverer(s) listed.

Historically the naming of moons did not always match the times of their discovery. Traditionally, the discoverer enjoys the privilege of naming the new object; however, some neglected to do so (E. E. Barnard stated he would &quot;defer any suggestions as to a name&quot; [for Amalthea] &quot;until a later paper&quot; but never got around to picking one from the numerous suggestions he received) or actively declined (S. B. Nicholson stated &quot;Many have asked what the new satellites [Lysithea and Carme] are to be named. They will be known only by the numbers X and XI, written in Roman numerals, and usually prefixed by the letter J to identify them with Jupiter.&quot;). The issue arose nearly as soon as planetary satellites were discovered: Galileo referred to the four main satellites of Jupiter using numbers while the names suggested by his rival Simon Marius gradually gained universal acceptance. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) eventually started officially approving names in the late 1970s. With the explosion of discoveries in the 21st century, new moons have once again started to be left unnamed even after their numbering, beginning with Jupiter LI and Jupiter LII in 2010.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Key info==
In the following tables, planetary satellites are indicated in bold type (e.g. Moon) while planets and dwarf planets, which directly circle the Sun, are in italic type (e.g. &quot;Earth&quot;). The Sun itself is indicated in roman type. The tables are sorted by publication/announcement date. Dates are annotated with the following symbols:
* &quot;i:&quot; for date of first imaging (photography, etc.);
* &quot;o:&quot; for date of first human visual observation, either through telescope or on photographic plate;
* &quot;p:&quot; for date of announcement or publication.
In a few cases, the date is uncertain and is then marked &quot;(?)&quot;.

&quot;* Note: Moons marked by an asterisk (*) had complicated discoveries, such as being lost and rediscovered. Some of them thus appear multiple times in the list to clarify the situation.&quot;

;Color legend
The Sun, the planets, dwarf planets, and their natural satellites are marked in the following colors:
;Sun
;Planets



;Consensus dwarf planets



It is not known precisely how many objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets. The nine objects listed in the third column are the ones agreed on by most astronomers, corresponding to a threshold of about 900–1000 km diameter.

;Designations
* Other designations are synonyms or periphrases sometimes encountered for the object.
* Permanent designations (of planetary satellites) are explained here.
* Temporary designations are explained here.

If a satellite is named, its name is bolded; if it is unnamed, but has a permanent designation, then its permanent designation is bolded; and if it has neither, then its temporary designation is bolded.

== 17th century ==
The numbering of Saturn&#x27;s moons was adjusted with each new discovery until 1848, in order to continue reflecting their order from their parent planet.

== 18th century ==
The numbering of Titania and Oberon underwent some confusion, because in 1797, Herschel reported four more satellites of Uranus that turned out not to exist. Before any more Uranian moons were discovered, William Lassell sometimes adopted Herschel&#x27;s numbers where Titania and Oberon are respectively Uranus II and IV, and sometimes called them respectively Uranus I and II. After he discovered Ariel and Umbriel in 1851, Lassell numbered the four real Uranian satellites then known outward from their parent planet as I (Ariel), II (Umbriel), III (Titania), and IV (Oberon), and this finally stuck.

== 19th century ==

The discovery of Amalthea marks the first time the Roman numerals were not adjusted with the discovery of a new satellite; from then on they reflected order of discovery rather than distance from the parent planet.

<text>Copley Place is an enclosed shopping mall in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is named after the nearby Copley Square, and is connected to the Prudential Center shopping mall via a skybridge over Huntington Avenue.

It features direct indoor connections to several nearby destinations including four office towers, and the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston hotels.

The mall currently features Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. 

In November 2019, the online business news website MassLive rated Copley Place as fourth, and the immediately adjacent Prudential Center as fifth best among 40 malls and shopping centers in Massachusetts.

==Description==
The bi-level indoors mall is noted for its upscale fashion stores, including Ralph Lauren, Christian Dior, John Varvatos, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, Victorinox Swiss Army, Porsche Design, Tiffany &amp; Co., Jimmy Choo, David Yurman, Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Saint Laurent, Ermenegildo Zegna, Burberry, Furla, and Gucci. Above, the third level provides access to a lobby, reception desk, and the bases of the four office towers.

The mall is connected directly to the Prudential Center shopping mall via a skybridge over Huntington Avenue. Another skybridge connects to the Westin at Copley Place hotel (and a few small shops), by crossing Huntington Avenue at a different location. A Marriott hotel anchors one end of Copley Place, and the Neiman Marcus department store anchors the other end. The mall is also connected to the Back Bay MBTA/Amtrak station via a pedestrian tunnel crossing beneath Dartmouth Street.

The property is managed by Simon Property Group, which acquired it in the 2002 breakup of the then Dutch-owned Urban Shopping Centers, Inc.

==History==

The structure was the first major project designed by Howard Elkus, then of The Architects&#x27; Collaborative. At the time, it was Boston&#x27;s largest urban mixed-use development project, financed by the Pritzker family of Chicago. It was built in 1983 directly above the Massachusetts Turnpike and Huntington Avenue highway interchange ramps, which had been constructed in 1964 on the site of the former South End Armory. The Armory building had been completed in 1890, and was razed to make room for the Mass Pike right-of-way. Later, as a principal of Elkus Manfredi Architects, Elkus would lead several major renovations of the mall, and a proposed expansion.

In 2011, plans for a addition of retail space to the facility and a expansion of its Neiman Marcus anchor were approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority. By February 2013, the project was awaiting final design plans. In October 2016, Simon Properties announced indefinite postponement of its $500-million project to build a 52-story luxury residential tower, and drastic scaling back of plans to expand the Copley Place mall, citing concerns about rising costs and competition from other Boston luxury towers already under construction.

Upon its opening, the indoor mall featured as its centerpiece a high sculptural fountain designed by Boston artist Dimitri Hadzi. The artwork was composed of multiple abstract granite and travertine marble shapes, with a waterfall cascading down it into a shallow pool at the bottom, surrounded by marble benches. A proposed renovation which would eliminate the water feature prompted commentary opposing its demolition in 2013. , the fountain had been completely removed, and the location and status of its sculptural components were unknown to the general public.

From its opening, the mall has been marketed as a high-end luxury retail location. Over time, the mix of stores changed in response to sweeping changes affecting the US retailing market. For example, a sizable Rizzoli Bookstore was located opposite the elevators behind the central water feature, but it had closed by the year 2000. Other stores which have moved out include Stoddard&#x27;s (fine cutlery and personal care tools) and Williams Sonoma (kitchenware and food ingredients). , almost all of the stores sell fashionable clothing, shoes, or accessories.

The mall had also housed one of the few major-chain-owned movie theaters within Boston city limits, but the Loews Copley Place Cinemas was closed in January 2005. It was replaced by Barneys New York men&#x27;s clothing, which closed in 2019. Barney&#x27;s became a new Saks Fifth Avenue Men&#x27;s Store, on August 14, 2020.
