<text>Portage la Prairie () is a small city in the Central Plains Region of Manitoba, Canada. In 2016, the population was 13,304 and the land area was . 

Portage la Prairie is approximately west of Winnipeg, along the Trans-Canada Highway (exactly halfway between the provincial boundaries of Saskatchewan and Ontario). It sits on the Assiniboine River, which flooded the town persistently until a diversion channel north to Lake Manitoba (the Portage Diversion) was built to divert the flood waters. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie.

According to Environment Canada, Portage la Prairie has the most sunny days during the warm months in Canada. It is the administrative headquarters of the Dakota Tipi First Nations reserve.

==History==
===Pre-colonial era===
Long before European settlers arrived in the mid-1800s, the Portage la Prairie area was first inhabited by several Indigenous nations (including the Anishinaabe/Ojibwe, Cree, and Dakota/Sioux peoples) at various times across millennia. 

Though anthropological evidence suggests the emergence of pre-historic plains cultures in southwestern Manitoba as early as 12,000 years ago, inhabitable grasslands and human activity likely never emerged around present-day Portage la Prairie until the receding of Lake Agassiz 8,000-10,000 years ago. 

===Fur trade===
Legend has it that coureurs des bois Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers—both instrumental in the founding of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company—may have been the first Europeans to visit the area as early as the mid-17th century. The name &quot;Portage la Prairie&quot;, perhaps coined by these early explorers, is derived from the French word &quot;portage&quot;, which means to carry a canoe overland between waterways, in this case over &quot;the prairie&quot;. This particular &quot;portage&quot; route, used by Indigenous peoples even before the global Fur Trade, ran for 25 kilometres between the Assiniboine River and Lake Manitoba.

In September 1738, after the Assiniboine River fur trade had extended into Western Canada, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye (a French-Canadian explorer and fur trader) built Fort La Reine north of the Assiniboine River. The fort served primarily as a French fur trading post, while also providing the explorers with a &quot;home&quot; operating base from which they would explore other parts of central Manitoba and western North America. The fort ceased operations after burning to the ground in 1759, toward the end of the French reign over the unsettled West. During intermittent periods between the years 1794 and 1913, both the Northwest Company and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had successfully established and operated trading posts in the area (the two entities amalgamated in 1821).

===Arrival of European settlers===
In 1851, Archdeacon William Cochrane (Cockran) of the Anglican Church, John McLean, as well as other ambitious settlers, were among the first to acquire permanent land in the area from the local Indigenous people, around what is now Crescent Lake (formerly known as &quot;The Slough&quot;). 

A school was soon built as settlers poured in from the east and the community began to develop, followed by a church (St. Mary&#x27;s La Prairie, 1854), and soon, numerous local businesses. The fertile soils of the Portage la Prairie area were &quot;discovered&quot; in the 1850s, giving birth to the future, agriculturally-based economy of the village; Cochrane encouraged people to start growing crops and gardens on their properties to fulfil the needs of the growing food demand. A local government was formed in 1857 and by the 1860s, there were sixty homes in the community.

===Republic of Manitobah===
For a brief period between 1867-68, just before the province of Manitoba entered confederation, Thomas Spence—a councillor for Louis Riel&#x27;s Provisional Government—controversially lead an organized movement to establish an independent state around the community of Portage la Prairie, known as the Republic of Manitobah. Spence&#x27;s hopeful plans for a new republic were soon quashed as his movement was never recognized as an official government nor granted any royal assent by the British monarchy.

===Birth and growth of a Prairie city===
The 1870s was a decade of rapid growth for Portage la Prairie, as many more settlers moved to town establishing farms and opening new businesses. By this time, the village had an operating flour mill, a local newspaper, and a community fair; just to name a few of Portage&#x27;s highlights. From the 1870s to the 1880s, the community increased in population by approximately 10 times (from 300 to 3,000). Freight and supplies were transported by oxcart and steamboat until the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1881, the year after Portage was incorporated as a town. Thomas Collins was the first mayor of Portage la Prairie.

In 1907, Portage was incorporated as a city, and from that point on, managed to keep a gradual rate of growth and development, serving as a regional hub for agriculture, retail, manufacturing and transportation in central Manitoba.

During World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force constructed Canadian Forces Base Portage la Prairie in support of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The station was controlled by the RCAF but used naval personnel as high-frequency direction finding operators. The station&#x27;s priority was German U-boat traffic. This site and CFB Rivers located at Rivers, Manitoba helped to increase the fix accuracy immensely.

Commercial cultivation of industrial cannabis was banned in Canada in 1938. In 1928, of industrial hemp was grown in Canada, with of that being in Portage la Prairie.

==Geography==
The city became a major transportation centre due to its proximity to the river, and later, the location of the main lines of the country&#x27;s national railways passing through the community. The CPR and Canadian National Railways (CNR) intersect in Portage; one of the few places in Canada where the two railways meet. This has made Portage la Prairie one of the most ideal places for railway aficionados to view trains; approximately 72 trains pass through the city each day. The Trans-Canada Highway, a major national transportation route, runs past the city and provides the community with business if highway travellers decide to make a trek into Portage.
The post-glacial flood plain surrounding Portage la Prairie is highly fertile, with rich, clay-loam soils abundant in nutrients. Portage la Prairie is therefore a major agricultural centre in Manitoba, and in Canada. The rural land surrounding the community is undoubtedly a breadbasket in North America, boasting some of the best soils on the continent for the production of a wide array of vegetables, berries, grains, and lentils.

The city has an aggressive tree-planting program and is known for its mature urban forest. A collection of some of the largest cottonwood trees in Canada line the west end of the main street known as Saskatchewan Avenue (as well as Crescent Road which runs adjacent to Crescent Lake), and, along with many other species like Manitoba maple, bur oak and green ash, are present throughout the city.

It is the home of former Prime Minister of Canada Arthur Meighen; a school and an avenue are named in his honour.

===Climate===
According to Environment Canada, Portage la Prairie has the most sunny days during the warm months in Canada. Portage has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;, United States Department of Agriculture, Plant Hardiness Zone 3a) with warm summers and very cold, dry winters. The highest temperature ever recorded in Portage La Prairie was on 11 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 2 February 1996.

==Arts and culture==

===Museums===
Fort la Reine Museum is a heritage museum and Manitoba Star Attraction located on the east end of Portage, operational since Canada&#x27;s Centennial in 1967. Today, the museum is home to an array of buildings from Portage and the surrounding region, and covers cultural and natural prairie history (local and regional) from the 18th century (the period of French exploration) to the present day. There are 25 buildings open to the public, each containing tens or even hundreds of artifacts, on display in an immersive history format. 

Some of the highlights of the museum include a replica of the historic Fort la Reine and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company York Boat; a railway caboose and the 1882 official rail car of Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, builder of the Canadian Pacific Railway; a fully restored Ukrainian Pioneer Church; a number of houses that are more than 100 years old; a firehall with a fully restored 1931 Seagrave Fire Truck; the Old Officers Mess from the now-retired Canadian Forces Base in Southport; a schoolhouse and church built in the 1880s from West Prospect (a pioneer farming community that no longer exists); and a Sioux tipi. 

The museum also brings in interactive travelling exhibitions from across Canada and beyond, set up in the main gallery to educate visitors on topics covering anything from prehistoric cultures in Canada to climate change. The museum also hosts annual cultural and theatrical events, including the National Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day celebrations, Canada Day festivities, heritage-themed tea parties, holiday celebrations, and other seasonal events.

===Festivals and events===
Portage la Prairie celebrates several annual events and festivals, which include the Portage Exhibition &amp; Fair (&quot;Portage Ex&quot;) held every July since 1872, the Portage Potato Festival which takes place in early to mid-August, Whoop &amp; Hollar Folk Festival in late August, and the Manitoba Air Show in June at Southport (held bi-annually). Concerts in the Park is a weekly summer concert series that is held in Island Park in July and August.

===Music scene===
The punk rock band Propagandhi was formed in the city in 1986 by guitarist Chris Hannah and drummer Jord Samolesky. Award-winning Canadian country band Doc Walker also hails from the Portage la Prairie area.

==Parks and outdoor recreation==
In central Portage la Prairie, residents and tourists can enjoy the amenities and beauty of the renowned Island Park. The sprawling city park is located on a peninsula, known as &quot;The Island&quot; (though not officially an island), and bounded by Crescent Lake, an ancient oxbow lake that is popular among birdwatchers, photographers, and canoeists/kayakers. Together, Crescent Lake and Island Park form one of Manitoba&#x27;s most recently-designated Star Attractions. For much of the year, the lake serves as a major nesting site for flocks of migratory waterfowl, most notably the Canada goose.

Island Park features a network of walking trails, tennis courts, a large playground, picnic areas, two bandstands, a duck pond, deer sanctuary, various monuments, and an extensive arboretum. Nearby recreational opportunities include an 18-hole golf course, the Portage Fairgrounds, an outdoor water park (Splash Island), and Stride Place—home of the Portage Terriers hockey club and an indoor wave pool. 

Just south of the Portage la Prairie by-pass is the Portage Spillway, where the Assiniboine River empties into the Portage Diversion. Not only does this area mark the importance of the river in Portage&#x27;s history, but it is home to Portage Spillway-Wayside Provincial Park, a park that is especially popular with fishermen in the summer months. Also not far southwest lies Spruce Woods Provincial Park and not far north lies St. Ambroise Beach Provincial Park. The city is also home to kilometres of multi-use recreational trails running through the parks and forested areas, which provide an oasis for sightseers to view wildlife. Geocaching has become popular in these areas, as people are finding more innovative ways to get out hiking in this scenic urban forest.

Aside from parks, the Portage la Prairie/Central Plains Region features many fine campgrounds located within a 15-30-minute drive of the city, and offers a few public beaches including Delta Beach, home to the Delta Marsh Field Station/Wildlife Reserve (part of this beach/area was destroyed due to flooding in the spring of 2011), Jackson Lake (located southeast of Sidney, Manitoba, about a 35-minute drive west of Portage la Prairie) and Twin Lakes Beach, an hour northeast of Portage, also on Lake Manitoba.

==Attractions==
Aside from Island Park, Fort la Reine Museum, and Prairie Fusion Arts &amp; Entertainment (William Glesby Theatre), Portage la Prairie is home to a variety of other attractions to visit, including:

One of Portage la Prairie&#x27;s most popular attractions, the Community Walkway, which parallels Crescent Lake&#x27;s waterfront, is a , multi-use trail used for walking, bicycling, skateboarding and rollerblading, running past many grand heritage homes and the tranquil, picturesque sites along the lake.

The World&#x27;s Largest Coca-Cola Can has also put Portage on the map and can be seen from the Trans-Canada Highway by-pass. It was constructed from an old water tower and is now located at the city&#x27;s west end between the local Canadian Tire and Canad Inns hotel on Saskatchewan Avenue West. 

Stride Place, formerly the PCU Centre, opened in February 2010 and features two National Hockey League regulation-size indoor arenas, one with seating capacity for 1,680, an indoor waterpark, fitness centre, and conference/event facilities. During the winter months, the Stride Place atrium is also home to the Portage Farmers&#x27; Market (taking place at various outdoor locations in the summertime). The BDO Centre for the Community is another local arena in the city&#x27;s north end, used predominantly for youth and children&#x27;s activities like hockey and ringette practice.

Portage la Prairie&#x27;s City Hall is a limestone structure that was designed by Thomas Fuller, who also designed the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. It was opened in 1898 as a Dominion Post Office and became City Hall in 1960. The building was declared a historical site in 1986. On the roof is a large, 1,000-pound bell that tolls for a few seconds daily at 9:00 am, noon, and 6:00 pm.

Portage la Prairie is also home to many other heritage buildings, some of greater architectural significance than others, highlighted on a historical walking tour organized by the city&#x27;s Heritage Advisory Committee. St. Mary&#x27;s la Prairie Anglican Church, first established in 1854 with its current sanctuary erected in 1898, is located downtown. Saskatchewan Avenue (the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare) is home to several historical structures, as well as Tupper Street and Royal Road (named after the Royal Visit of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and King George VI in 1939). Crescent Road, which follows Crescent Lake for over 5 kilometres, is lined with many large, grand heritage homes dating back to the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Portage&#x27;s largest hotel, part of Canad-Inns, is located in the west end of the city. This hotel includes the rink of the Portage Curling Club, Aalto&#x27;s Garden Cafe, a pub known as Tavern United, and many banquet halls.

The community of Southport, located about south of Portage la Prairie, is home to the Southport Recplex featuring a fitness centre with a rock-climbing wall, gymnasium, and 5-pin bowling alley; aside from the proudly displayed military/air force history throughout the town and airport.

==Military==

Portage la Prairie had a military airbase south of the community known as Canadian Forces Base Portage la Prairie, now 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School. It was established as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the Second World War and trained thousands of pilots for military service from around the world.

In 1990, the federal government transferred the assets of the property to Southport Aerospace Centre Inc., a not-for-profit property management and development company whose goal was to successfully manage the site. Royal Canadian Air Force pilot training continues at 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School under private contract at Southport.

The 13th Field Battery of the 26th Field Artillery Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery is based out of Portage la Prairie.

During the Second World War an &quot;Algerine&quot;-class minesweeper commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy was named after Portage la Prairie. The &quot;Portage&quot; was active during the war as an escort and later as a training vessel. As part of the 100th Anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy, in 2010, the Navy provided the city with a display on the ship that is located in City Hall.

==Economy==
The local economy is largely dependent on agriculture and supporting industries (trucking, transportation, chemical/fertilizer, farm machinery dealerships, etc.). Portage la Prairie is also home to the McCain Foods and Simplot potato processing plants, which provide French fries for McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, and various other commercialized restaurant chains. Viterra, owned by Glencore Xstrata and previously known as Can-oat milling, one of the largest oat mills in the world, and is now owned by Richardson International, is also located in the municipality. McMillan Industrial Park, located on the eastern fringes of Portage, also plays a major role in the city&#x27;s economy. Numerous industries including food science labs and food processing facilities, construction companies, and manufacturing sectors are located in this expanding industrial area, beneficial for the creation of jobs in the community.

The city has developed into a regional retail service centre as large big box style stores began to operate on the west end of the city in 2007. The west end will continue to see future development with new retail outlets lined up. Many small towns and Native reserves use this as their primary shopping destination. Since Portage la Prairie is a commercial hub for the Central Plains Area, it serves some 50,000 people living within an approximately 50 km radius.

Portage la Prairie is a farming city, with an average of 122 frost free days, and a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 3a. Agriculture is the city&#x27;s main industry.

==Government==

The city is governed by a mayor and six councillors. Elected in October 2022, the current mayor is Sharilyn Knox, who previously served four years on City Council. She is Portage la Prairie&#x27;s 42nd mayor and the second woman to hold office in the city.

Jeff Bereza, Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 2023 to represent the Portage la Prairie provincial electoral district, following in the footsteps of long-time Portage Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Ian Wishart.

Conservative Party member Branden Leslie was elected to the Parliament of Canada in 2023 to represent the Portage—Lisgar riding, during a by-election held following the resignation of long-time Member of Parliament (MP) Candice Bergen.

===City issues===

Various new residential developments and an upsurge in renovating older homes is contributing to the improvement of housing stock in the community. All of these new housing developments are occurring on the south side of the town, on or near Crescent Lake and Garrioch Creek.

Flooding also poses an occasional problem in the rural area of Portage la Prairie, especially during the spring.

In 2010, MoneySense, as part of MSN&#x27;s news site, rated Portage la Prairie in a tie for Canada&#x27;s worst city to live in, with relation to population decline, but at the same time was ranked the 69th, out of 180 cities, best place to live in Canada. According to the 2012 MoneySense statistics, a series of polls in a number of different areas that relate to the benefits of living in a city, rated Portage la Prairie as the 49th best city, up from 60th in 2011, to live in overall (out of 190 Canadian communities), in Canada, and the 8th best in its population group. This is due to community revitalization programs and measures that have been taken to promote growth and industry, safety, culture, infrastructure, etc., which have significantly contributed to the growth, prosperity and strengthening economy of the community.

==Sports==
Portage la Prairie is home to the Portage Terriers, who play in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, and the Central Plains Capitals, who play in the Manitoba Midget &#x27;AAA&#x27; and Manitoba Female Midget Hockey Leagues. In the 2014/2015 season, the Portage Terriers had a regular season record of 53 wins, 4 losses and 3 ties and had the best hockey record/winning percentage in the world. In that season, they also won the Turnbull Cup as champions of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League and hosted the RBC Cup for the National Junior A Championship, which they also won.

Stride Place is the city&#x27;s main recreation facility and houses two arenas, an aquatic centre, a fitness centre, and indoor walking track. Outdoor sports facilities are located at the Republic of Manitobah Park. The Portage Centennial Arena (now called the BDO Centre for the Community) shared hosting duties of the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships with Winnipeg, Morden and Selkirk. The city, along with Winnipeg, also hosted the 2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. In 2015, the city played host to the Royal Bank Cup, Canada&#x27;s national junior hockey championship, which was won by the host Terriers. Several sports films have been shot at Stride Place, including &quot;Goon&quot; and &quot;The Wrath of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II&quot;.

The Uniroyal/Goodrich World Junior Curling Championships were held at the Portage Curling Club in 1990. Canadian women skipped by Cathy Overton-Clapham, won bronze and the men skipped by Dean Joanisse came fourth. The Portage Curling Club has twice played host to the Canadian Senior Curling Championships. 
As part of the 2012–13 World Curling Tour the city hosted the 2012 Canad Inns Prairie Classic which was won by Kevin Koe. In the same year the 2012 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts was held in Portage and won by Jennifer Jones.

In 2015, the city had a junior roller derby team.

Portage is represented in the Manitoba Major Soccer League by the Portage Aeros in the MMSL Major Senior Division 4 and by Portage United in the MMSL Major Senior Division 4. The Portage Blaze Women&#x27;s Soccer Club plays in the First Division of the Winnipeg Women&#x27;s Soccer League. Their home fields are located in the Republic of Manitobah Park in the south-east corner of the city. The park has a dozen different sized soccer pitches, many baseball/softball diamonds and a rugby pitch.

Portage was a popular stop on the Great Western Manitoba Harness Racing circuit, but in 2009 the horse race track and stands were removed to make way for the Portage Credit Union Centre, now called Stride Place. It is a community centre with two arenas (one the home of the Terriers) and a water park. The former horse race stands were known as the Pan-Am Stadium and played host to baseball during the Winnipeg Pan-Am Games in 1967.

Portage la Prairie also has a lot of youth sports. Ringette, hockey, soccer and baseball have youth sports leagues within the city. Football is played in the Winnipeg Youth Football League with many teams of varying ages using the name Portage Pitbulls. Basketball is also played in Winnipeg in the Rising Stars League and in various community clubs. Also there is a healthy competition between the four junior high schools in sports such as basketball, volleyball and curling.

<text>Lop Nur or Lop Nor (, from an Oirat Mongolic name meaning &quot;Lop Lake&quot;, where &quot;Lop&quot; is a toponym of unknown origin) is a now largely dried-up salt lake formerly located within the &quot;Lop Depression&quot; in the eastern fringe of the Tarim Basin in the southeastern portion of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, northwestern China, between the Taklamakan and Kumtag deserts. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur town (), also known as Luozhong () of Ruoqiang County, which in its turn is part of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.

The lake system, into which the Tarim River and Shule River drain from the west and east respectively, is the last remnant of the historical post-glacial Tarim Lake, which once covered more than in the Tarim Basin but had progressively shrunk throughout the Holocene due to rain shadowing by the Tibetan Plateau. Lop Nur is hydrologically endorheic, it is landbound and has no outlet, and has relied largely on meltwater runoffs from the Tianshan, Kunlun and the western Qilian Mountains. The lake measured in 1928, but has dried up due to construction of reservoirs which dammed the flow of water feeding into the lake, and only small seasonal lakes and salt marshes may form. The dried-up Lop Nur Basin is covered with a salt crust ranging from in thickness.

An area to the northwest of Lop Nur has been used as a nuclear testing site. Since the discovery of potash at the site in the mid-1990s, it is also the location of a large-scale mining operation. There are some restricted areas under military management and cultural relics protection points in the region, which are not open to the public.

== History ==
From around 1800 BC until the 9th century the lake supported a thriving Tocharian culture. Archaeologists have discovered the buried remains of settlements, as well as several of the Tarim mummies, along its ancient shoreline. Former water resources of the Tarim River and Lop Nur nurtured the kingdom of Loulan since the second century BC, an ancient civilisation along the Silk Road, which skirted the lake-filled basin. Loulan became a client state of the Chinese empire in 55 BC, renamed Shanshan. Faxian went by the Lop Desert on his way to the Indus valley (395–414), followed by later Chinese pilgrims. Marco Polo in his travels passed through the Lop Desert. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the explorers Ferdinand von Richthofen, Nikolai Przhevalsky, Sven Hedin and Aurel Stein visited and studied the area. It is also likely that Swedish soldier Johan Gustaf Renat had visited the area when he was helping the Zunghars to produce maps over the area in the eighteenth century.

The lake was given various names in ancient Chinese texts. In &quot;Shiji&quot; it was called Yan Ze (鹽澤, literally Salt Marsh), indicating its saline nature, near which was located the ancient Loulan Kingdom. In &quot;Hanshu&quot; it was called Puchang Hai (蒲昌海, literally Sea of Abundant Reed) and was given a dimension of 300 to 400 &quot;li&quot; (roughly 120–160 km) in length and breadth, indicating it was once a lake of great size. These early texts also mentioned the belief, mistaken as it turns out, that the lake joins the Yellow River at Jishi through an underground channel as the source of the river.
The lake was referred to as the &quot;Wandering Lake&quot; in the early 20th century due to the Tarim River changing its course, causing its terminal lake to alter its location between the Lop Nur dried basin, the Kara-Koshun dried basin and the Taitema Lake basin. This shift of the terminal lake caused some confusion amongst the early explorers as to the exact location of Lop Nur. Imperial maps from the Qing dynasty showed Lop Nur to be located in similar position to the present Lop Nur dried basin, but the Russian geographer Nikolay Przhevalsky instead found the terminal lake at Kara-Koshun in 1867. Sven Hedin visited the area in 1900–1901 and suggested that the Tarim river periodically changed its course to and from between its southbound and northbound direction, resulting in a shift in the position of the terminal lake. The change in the course of the river, which resulted in Lop Nur drying up, was also suggested by Hedin as the reason why ancient settlements such as Loulan had perished.

In 1921, due to human intervention, the terminal lake shifted its position back to Lop Nur. The lake measured 2400 km2 in area in 1930–1931. In 1934, Sven Hedin went down the new Kuruk Darya (&quot;Dry River&quot;) in a canoe. He found the delta to be a maze of channels and the new lake so shallow that it was difficult to navigate even in a canoe. He had previously walked the dry Kuruk Darya in a caravan in 1900.

In 1952 the terminal lake then shifted to Taitema Lake when the Tarim River and Konque River were separated through human intervention, and Lop Nur dried out again by 1964. In 1972, the Daxihaizi Reservoir was built at Tikanlik, water supply to the lake was cut off, and all the lakes for the most part then dried out, with only small seasonal lakes forming in local depressions in Taitema. The loss of water to the lower Tarim River Valley also led to the deterioration and loss of poplar forests and tamarix shrubs that used to be extensively distributed along the lower Tarim River Valley forming the so-called &quot;Green Corridor&quot;. In 2000, in an effort to prevent further deterioration of the ecosystem, water was diverted from Lake Bosten in an attempt to fill the Taitema Lake. The Taitema Lake however had shifted westwards during the past 40 years due in part to the spread of the desert. Another cause of the destabilization of the desert has been the cutting of poplars and willows for firewood; in response, a restoration project to reclaim the poplar forests was initiated.

The Kara-Koshun dried basin may be considered part of the greater Lop Nur.

On 17 June 1980, Chinese scientist Peng Jiamu disappeared while walking into Lop Nur in search of water. His body was never found, and his disappearance remains a mystery. On 3 June 1996, the Chinese explorer Yu Chunshun died while trying to walk across Lop Nur.

== Nuclear weapons test base ==
Lop Nur, situated in the arid Xinjiang region of China&#x27;s far west, serves as an extensive military base. This location was selected for nuclear testing due to its desolate and isolated nature, devoid of any permanent inhabitants, though the broader Xinjiang region is home to the Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has historically faced widespread detentions and stringent security measures in Xinjiang conflict. The Uyghurs have persistently voiced concerns regarding the health risks posed by the towering mushroom clouds and the release of radioactive fallout.

China established the Lop Nur Nuclear Test Base on 16 October 1959 with Soviet assistance in selection of the site, with its headquarters at Malan (, &quot;Mǎlán&quot;), about northwest of Qinggir. The first Chinese nuclear bomb test, codenamed &quot;Project 596&quot;, occurred at Lop Nur on 16 October 1964. China detonated its first hydrogen bomb on 17 June 1967. Until 1996, 45 nuclear tests were conducted. These nuclear tests were conducted by dropping bombs from aircraft, mounted on towers, launching missiles, detonating weapons underground and in the atmosphere.

In 2009, Jun Takada, a Japanese scientist, published the results of his computer simulation which suggests – based on deaths from Soviet tests – that 190,000 people could have died in China from nuclear-related illnesses. Enver Tohti, an exiled pro-Uyghur independence activist, claimed that cancer rates in the province of Xinjiang were 30 to 35% higher than the national average. On 29 July 1996, China conducted its 45th and final nuclear test at Lop Nor, and issued a formal moratorium on nuclear testing the following day, although further subcritical tests were suspected. In 2012, China announced plans to spend US$1 million to clean up the Malan nuclear base in Lop Nor to create a red tourism site.

In December 2023, a report emerged indicating that China was making preparations to resume nuclear tests in a remote desert. Satellite imagery provided evidence of these preparations, revealing the presence of a drilling rig that had created a deep vertical shaft. This shaft was believed to be designed to contain the destructive power of radiation resulting from large nuclear explosions.

Further analysis of the satellite images since 2017 also uncovered the development of new infrastructure at the site. This included the construction of new roads, power lines, an electrical substation, and a support area with multiple buildings. What was once a modest site with only a few buildings had transformed into a modern and sophisticated complex, complete with security fences. One of the new structures was a bunker that was fortified with earthen berms and lightning arresters, indicating its suitability for handling high explosives. Tests on miniaturization of missiles and warheads can also be possibly carried out at this site. However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has dismissed the report and its &quot;utterly irresponsible&quot; claims. China has denied any nuclear testing plans on the site.

==Ecology==
Lop Nur is home to the wild Bactrian camel, which is a separate species from the Bactrian camel. The camels have continued to breed naturally despite the nuclear testing. China signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 but did not ratify it. Subsequently, the camels were classified as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List. Since the cessation of nuclear testing at Lop Nur, human incursions into the area have caused a decline in the camel population. Wild Bactrian camels have been classified as critically endangered since 2002 and approximately half of the 1400 remaining wild Bactrian camels live on the former Lop Nur test base, which has been designated the Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve.

== Transportation ==
A highway from Hami to Lop Nur (Xinjiang Provincial Highway 235) was completed in 2006.

The Hami–Lop Nur Railway, which runs north to Hami, along the same route, opened to freight operations in November 2012. The railway is used to transport potassium-rich salt mined at the lake to the Lanzhou–Xinjiang railway.

It is also served by the Hotan–Ruoqiang railway, which loops around the south and west side of the Tarim Basin, part of the Taklimakan Desert railway loop, joined together with sections of the Golmud–Korla railway, Kashgar–Hotan railway, and Southern Xinjiang railway.

== Archaeological sites ==

Given the extreme dryness and resulting thin population, remains of some buildings survived for a significant period of time. When ancient graves - some a few thousand years old - were opened, the bodies were often found to be mummified and grave goods well preserved. The earliest sites are associated with an ancient people of indigenous Siberian origin.

=== Loulan ===
Loulan or Kroran was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city already known in the 2nd century BCE on the north-eastern edge of the Lop Desert. It was renamed Shanshan after Chinese took control of the kingdom in 1st century BCE. It was abandoned some time in the seventh century. Its location was discovered by Sven Hedin in 1899, who excavated some houses and found a wooden Kharosthi tablet and many Chinese manuscripts from the Jin dynasty (266–420). Aurel Stein also excavated at the site in the beginning of the 20th century, while Chinese archaeologists explored the area in the latter part of the 20th century. A mummy called the Beauty of Loulan was found at a cemetery site on the bank of Töwän River.

=== Xiaohe Cemetery ===
The Xiaohe Cemetery is located to the west of Lop Nur. This Bronze Age burial site is an oblong sand dune, from which more than thirty well preserved mummies have been excavated. The entire Xiaohe Cemetery contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which have been violated by grave robbers.

A local hunter guided the Swedish explorer and archeologist Folke Bergman to the site in 1934. An excavation project by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute began in October 2003. A total of 167 tombs have been dug up since the end of 2002 and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers, as well as other precious artifacts. In 2006, a valuable archeological finding was uncovered: a boat-shaped coffin wrapped in ox hide, containing the mummified body of a young woman.

=== Qäwrighul ===
In 1979, some of the earliest of the Tarim mummies were discovered in burial sites at Qäwrighul (Gumugou), which is located to the west of Lop Nur, on the Könchi (Kongque) river. Forty-two graves, most of which dated from 2100 to 1500 BC, were found. There were two types of tomb at the site, belonging to two different time periods. The first type of burial featured shaft pit graves, some of which had poles at either end to mark east and west. Bodies were found extended, usually facing east, and sometimes were wrapped in wool weavings and wearing felt hats. Artifacts found included basketry, wheat grains, cattle and sheep/goat horns, bird bone necklaces and bracelets, nephrite beads, and fragments of copper (or bronze), although no pottery was discovered.

The second type of burial, from a later period, also consisted of shaft pit graves, surrounded by seven concentric circles of poles. Six male graves were found, in which the bodies were extended on their backs, and facing towards the east. Few artifacts were found, except for some traces of copper, or bronze.

=== Miran ===
Miran is located to the south-west of Lop Nur. Buddhist monasteries were excavated here, and murals and sculptures showed artistic influences from India and Central Asia, with some showing influences from as far as Rome.

<doc id="540169" wikidata="Q1344338" url="?curid=540169" title="Rajōmon">
<text>, also called , was the gate built at the southern end of the monumental Suzaku Avenue in the ancient Japanese cities of Heijō-kyō (Nara) and Heian-kyō (Kyoto), in accordance with the Chinese grid-patterned city layout. At the other far north-end of Suzaku Avenue, one would reach the Suzakumon Gate, the main entrance to the palace zone. , the southern end of Suzaku Avenue and the possible remainder of the equivalent gate in Fujiwara-kyō (Kashihara) are yet to be discovered.

== Name ==
The gate&#x27;s name in modern Japanese is &quot;Rajōmon&quot;. &quot;Rajō&quot; (羅城) refers to city walls and &quot;mon&quot; (門) means &quot;gate,&quot; so &quot;Rajōmon&quot; signifies the main city gate. Originally, this gate was known as &quot;Raseimon&quot; or &quot;Raiseimon&quot;, using alternate readings for the kanji in the name. The name &quot;Rashōmon&quot;, using the kanji 羅生門 (which can also be read &quot;Raseimon&quot;), was popularized by a noh play Rashōmon (c.1420) written by Kanze Nobumitsu (1435–1516).

The modern name, &quot;Rajōmon&quot;, uses the original kanji (羅城門 rather than 羅生門) and employs the more common reading for the second character (&quot;jō&quot; instead of &quot;sei&quot;).

== Rashōmon in Kyoto (Heian-kyō) ==

The Rashōmon in Kyoto was the grander of the two city gates built during the Heian period (794–1185). Built in 789, it was wide by high, with a stone wall and topped by a ridge-pole. By the 12th century it had fallen into disrepair and had become an unsavory place, with a reputation as a hideout for thieves and other disreputable characters. People would abandon corpses and unwanted babies at the gate.

The ruined gate is the central setting — and provides the title — for Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&#x27;s short story &quot;Rashōmon&quot; and hence for Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1950 film. Akutagawa&#x27;s use of the gate was deliberately symbolic, with the gate&#x27;s ruined state representing the moral and physical decay of Japanese civilization and culture. According to one legend, it was inhabited by the demon Ibaraki Dōji.

Today, not a foundation stone of the gate remains. A stone pillar marks the place where it once stood, just northeast of the intersection of Kujō street and (formerly Suzaku street), a short walk west from the Heian-period temple Tō-ji. This stretch of Kujō is designated Route 171, and is just west of Route 1. A wooden sign written in Japanese and English explains the history and significance of the gate. The site is behind a nondescript shop on Kujō street, and sits directly next to a small playground. Though a nearby bus stop is named Rajōmon, those unfamiliar with the area are likely to miss the Rashōmon site.

== Rajōmon in Nara (Heijo-kyō) ==
The Rajōmon in Nara stood about 4 km south of the Suzakumon of Heijō Palace. Their foundation stones were found in the excavations conducted between 1969 and 1972. From the remaining foundations, the width of the gate is estimated to have been 41.5 m.

Some of the foundation stones were reused in the 16th century by Toyotomi Hidenaga, who was expanding his castle in Kōriyama.

<doc id="540172" wikidata="Q663529" url="?curid=540172" title="Quickstep">
<text>The quickstep is a light-hearted dance of the standard ballroom dances. The movement of the dance is fast and powerfully flowing and sprinkled with syncopations. The upbeat melodies that quickstep is danced to make it suitable for both formal and informal events. Its origins are in combination of slow foxtrot combined with the Charleston, a dance which was one of the precursors to what today is called swing dancing.

==History==
The quickstep evolved in the 1920s from a combination of the foxtrot, Charleston, shag, peabody, and one-step. The dance is English in origin and was standardized in 1927. While it evolved from the foxtrot, the quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern foxtrot, the leader often closes his feet, and syncopated steps are regular occurrences (as was the case in early foxtrot). Three characteristic dance figures of the quickstep are the chassés, where the feet are brought together, the quarter turns, and the lock step.p126

This dance gradually evolved into a very dynamic one with much movement on the dance floor, with many advanced patterns including hops, runs, quick steps with much momentum, and rotation. The tempo of quickstep dance is rather brisk, as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music, which is fast-paced when compared to other dance music.

By the end of the 20th century the complexity of quickstep as done by advanced dancers had increased, with the extensive use of syncopated steps with eighth note durations. While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with &quot;quick&quot; (one beat) and &quot;slow&quot; (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as &quot;quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow&quot;, with there being further steps on the &#x27;and&#x27;s.

==Style==
The quickstep is elegant like the foxtrot and should be smooth and glamorous. The dancers should appear to be very light on their feet. It is very energetic and form-intensive.
The quickstep is danced to 4/4 music of 48 to 52 measures per minute.

==Syllabus==
The two International Style syllabi of ISTD and IDTA for quickstep differ very little.

The American Style dance competition program does not include quickstep, but a limited version of the dance is taught and danced socially in some American dance venues.

<doc id="540173" wikidata="Q1570161" url="?curid=540173" title="Hematemesis">
<text>Hematemesis is the vomiting of blood. It can be confused with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or epistaxis (nosebleed), which are more common. The source is generally the upper gastrointestinal tract, typically above the suspensory muscle of duodenum. It may be caused by ulcers, tumors of the stomach or esophagus, varices, prolonged and vigorous retching, gastroenteritis, ingested blood (from bleeding in the mouth, nose, or throat), or certain drugs.
Hematemesis is treated as a medical emergency, with treatments based on the amount of blood loss. Investigations include endoscopy. Any blood loss may be corrected with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Patients may need to avoid taking anything by mouth.

== Definition ==
Hematemesis is the vomiting of blood. This is usually vomit that contains bright red blood. Coffee ground vomiting is similar to hematemesis, but is distinct in not involving bright red blood.

Hematemesis must be differentiated from hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and epistaxis (nosebleed). Both of these are more common conditions. These may be difficult to distinguish.

== Differential diagnosis ==
Hematemesis may be caused by:
* Peptic ulcer. This may be related to Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, which causes severe disease.
* Vascular malfunctions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as bleeding gastric varices or intestinal varices.
* Mallory–Weiss syndrome: bleeding tears in the esophagal mucosa, usually caused by prolonged and vigorous retching.
* Vomiting of ingested blood after bleeding in the mouth, nose, or throat.
* Tumors of the stomach or esophagus.
* Irritation or erosion of the lining of the esophagus or stomach.
* Radiation poisoning.
* Viral hemorrhagic fevers.
* Gastroenteritis.
* Gastritis.
* Chronic viral hepatitis.
* Hepatic schistosomiasis, or intestinal schistosomiasis. This is caused by the parasite &quot;Schistosoma mansoni.&quot;
* Iatrogenic injury (invasive procedure such as endoscopy or transesophageal echocardiography)
* Atrio-oesophageal fistula.
* Yellow fever.
* Strongyloidiasis.
* Certain drugs.
* Plague, most commonly from septicemic plague.
* Liver cirrhosis.
* Vascular lesions, e.g. Dieulafay&#x27;s disease.

== Mechanism ==
The source of vomited blood is usually from the upper gastrointestinal tract. This can include the esophagus, stomach, and parts of the small intestine. This may be the suspensory muscle of duodenum. Hematemesis tends to occur only after significant blood loss.

== Evaluation ==
Hematemesis may be investigated with endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Barium meal may also be used.

== Management ==

Hematemesis is treated as a medical emergency. The most vital distinction is whether there is blood loss sufficient to cause shock. Correct management is required in such conditions. It is required to perform all tests such as endoscopy before medication. A platelet test is also an important test in such conditions. Medicines such as painkillers or antibiotics, e.g. ciprofloxacin, could decrease platelet count which can lead to thrombocytopenia (when the body does not have sufficient platelets in the blood and cannot form clots). In such conditions wrong medication or management could be deadly. Blood transfusion is required in such conditions if the body loses more than 20 percent of body blood volume. Severe loss makes it impossible for the heart to pump a sufficient amount of blood to the body. In such conditions unmaintained blood volume could lead to hypovolemic shock (hypovolemic shock could lead to damage of body organs e.g. kidney, brain, or gangrene of arms or legs). An untreated patient could develop cerebral atrophy.

=== Minimal blood loss ===
In cases that do not involve shock, treatment may involve proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole) to treat stomach ulcers if they are present. This is given until endoscopy can be arranged. Blood transfusions may be given if the level of hemoglobin in the blood is extremely low, that is less than 8.0 g/dL or 4.5–5.0 mmol/L. A patient may be kept nothing by mouth (or no eating or drinking). Adequate venous access (such as with large-bore cannulas or a central venous catheter) is generally obtained, in case the patient develops a further bleed and becomes unstable.

=== Significant blood loss ===
In a &quot;hemodynamically significant&quot; case of hematemesis, there may be shock. Resuscitation is an immediate priority to prevent death. Intravenous fluids and blood transfusions can be given, preferably by large-bore intravenous cannula. The patient is prepared for emergency endoscopy, which is typically done in a operating theatre. Surgical opinion is usually sought in case the source of bleeding cannot be identified endoscopically, and laparotomy is necessary. Securing the airway is a top priority in hematemesis patients, especially those with a disturbed conscious level (hepatic encephalopathy in esophageal varices patient). This may be achieved with a cuffed endotracheal tube. Octreotide may be used if bleeding may be caused by varices.

=== Techniques ===
Hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia are symptoms of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding that brings the patient to the physician is a potential emergency and must be considered as such until its seriousness can be evaluated. The goals in managing a major acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage are to treat hypovolemia by restoring the blood volume to normal, to make a diagnosis of the bleeding site and its underlying cause, and to treat the cause of the bleeding as definitively as possible. The history should be directed toward (1) confirming the presence of bleeding; (2) estimating its amount and rapidity; (3) identifying the source and potential specific causes; and (4) eliciting the presence of serious associated diseases that might adversely affect the outcome. The information obtained is especially helpful in identifying situations that require aggressive management.

<text>Melena is a form of blood in stool which refers to the dark black, tarry feces that are commonly associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The black color and characteristic strong odor are caused by hemoglobin in the blood being altered by digestive enzymes and intestinal bacteria.

Iron supplements may cause a grayish-black stool that should be distinguished from melena, as should black coloration caused by a number of medications, such as bismuth subsalicylate (the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol), or by foods such as beetroot, black liquorice, or blueberries.

==Causes==
The most common cause of melena is peptic ulcer disease. However, any bleeding within the upper gastrointestinal tract or the ascending colon can lead to melena. Melena may also be a complication of anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin.

Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding that may result in melena include malignant tumors affecting the esophagus, stomach or small intestine, hemorrhagic blood diseases, such as thrombocytopenia and hemophilia, gastritis, stomach cancer, esophageal varices, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum and Mallory-Weiss syndrome.

Causes of &quot;false&quot; melena include iron supplements, Pepto-Bismol, Maalox, and lead, blood swallowed as a result of a nose bleed (epistaxis), and blood ingested as part of the diet, as with consumption of black pudding (blood sausage), or with the traditional African Maasai diet, which includes much blood drained from cattle.

Melena is considered a medical emergency as it arises from a significant amount of bleeding. Urgent care is required to rule out serious causes and prevent potentially life-threatening emergencies.

A less serious, self-limiting case of melena can occur in newborns two to three days after delivery, due to swallowed maternal blood.

==Diagnosis==
In acute cases, with a large amount of blood loss, patients may present with anemia or low blood pressure. However, aside from the melena itself, many patients may present with few symptoms. Often, the first approach is to use endoscopy to look for obvious signs of a bleed. In cases where the source of the bleed is unclear, but melena is present, an upper endoscopy is recommended, to try to ascertain the source of the bleed.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding sources usually present with hematochezia or frank blood. A test with poor sensitivity/specificity that may detect the source of bleeding is the tagged red blood cell scan. This is especially used for slow bleeding (&lt;0.5 ml/min). However, for rapid bleeding (&gt;0.5 ml/min), mesenteric angiogram ± embolization is the gold standard. Colonoscopy is often first line, however.

===Melena versus hematochezia===
Bleeds that originate from the lower gastrointestinal tract (such as the sigmoid colon and rectum) are generally associated with the passage of bright red blood, or hematochezia, particularly when brisk. Only blood that originates from a more proximal source (such as the small intestine), or bleeding from a lower source that occurs slowly enough to allow for enzymatic breakdown, is associated with melena. For this reason, melena is often associated with blood in the stomach or duodenum (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), for example by a peptic ulcer. A rough estimate is that it takes about 14 hours for blood to be broken down within the intestinal lumen; therefore if transit time is less than 14 hours the patient will have hematochezia, and if greater than 14 hours the patient will exhibit melena. One often-stated rule of thumb is that melena only occurs if the source of bleeding is above the ligament of Treitz although, as noted below, exceptions occur with enough frequency to render it unreliable.

==Etymology==
The origin of &quot;melena&quot; is dated to the early 19th century via modern Latin, via Greek &quot;melaina&quot; (feminine of &quot;melas&quot;, black).

<text>The Tarim River (; ), known in Sanskrit as the Śītā, is an endorheic river in Xinjiang, China. It is the principal river of the Tarim Basin, a desert region of Central Asia between the Tian Shan and Kunlun Mountains. The river historically terminated at Lop Nur, but today reaches no further than Taitema Lake before drying out.

It is the longest inland river in China. The Tarim River originates from the Karakoram Mountains and flows into Lop Nur along the northern edge of the Taklimakan Desert. It has a total length of 2,327 kilometers and a drainage area of 1.02 million square kilometers. Its main tributaries include the Hotan River, the Aksu River, and the Kashgar River. The course of the Tarim River swings from north to south in history, and its migration is uncertain. The last major river change occurred in 1921, when the main stream was diverted to the east and flowed into Lop Nur through the Kongque River. In 1952, a dam was built near Yuli County, separated from the Kongque River, and the river water returned to Taitma Lake and Lop Nur through the old road of Tieganlik.

==Etymology==
The Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD called the Tarim River the Oichardes River in his book &quot;Geography&quot;. &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; is called the South River. In the Northern dynasties, Sui and Tang dynasties, the Tarim River was called Ji-style water, Ji-shu water and Ji-shou water. The Qing dynasty&#x27;s &quot;Map of the Western Regions&quot; called it &quot;Erse Gol&quot;, which means &quot;flowing water&quot; in Mongolian. According to the &quot;Draft of Qing History&quot;, the name of the river Tarim means &quot;horse without reins&quot;, which describes the river&#x27;s frequent diversion. In the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Jiaqing of the Qing dynasty (1819), Xu Song wrote in &quot;The Record of the Waterways of the Western Regions&quot;: &quot;The Hui language (Uyghur language) refers to the &#x27;cultivable land&#x27; called Tarim, and it is said that the people living in the riverside are farming for their business.&quot;

==Geography and climate==
The total length of the Yarkand-Tarim river system is , although, as the Tarim frequently changes its channel, the length tends to vary over the years. 
It is shallow, unsuitable for navigation, and because of its heavy silt load, forms a braided stream near its terminus. The area of the Tarim River Basin is about . A considerable part of the Tarim&#x27;s course is unformed, following no clearly defined riverbed. The water volume of the lower course of the river diminishes as a result of extensive evaporation and water-diversion schemes.

The Tarim River Basin belongs to the inland river basin, which originates from the inland rivers in the mountains around the Tarim Basin and flows into the basin, forming a centripetal water system. The river system of the Tarim River Basin is composed of 144 rivers originating from the Tianshan Mountains, the Pamir Plateau, the Karakoram Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains and the Altun Mountains around the Tarim Basin. River system, Weigan river system, Aksu river system, Kashgar river system, Yarkand river system, Hotan river system, Keriya river system, Cheerchen river system.

The water source of the Tarim River completely comes from the tributaries originating from the surrounding mountainous areas, and the sediment content is very high. The average annual water volume of the Tarim River at the confluence of the three major sources is 4.299 billion cubic meters, of which the Aksu River is 3.358 billion cubic meters, the Yeerqiang River is 23 million cubic meters, and the Hotan River 918 million cubic meters. In the downstream, 212 million cubic meters are introduced from the Kongque River, and the total water volume of the main stream is 4.511 billion cubic meters. At the same time, the amount of water varies greatly due to seasonal differences. In summer, snow and glaciers melt, which increases the amount of water and decreases in winter. The Tarim River is a naturally dissipative river in history, with an average annual water consumption of 1.669 billion cubic meters in the upper reaches, 2.296 billion cubic meters in the middle reaches, and only 633 million cubic meters of water entering the downstream. The distribution of glacier runoff is uneven throughout the year. The water inflow from June to September accounts for 70%-80% of the annual runoff, and most of them are floods; the irrigation season from March to May only accounts for about 10% of the annual runoff. is likely to cause spring drought.

Precipitation in the Tarim Basin is extremely scant, and in some years it is nonexistent. In the Taklamakan Desert and in the Lop Nur basin, the average annual total of precipitation is about . In the foothills and in several other areas of the river&#x27;s basin, the precipitation amounts to from a year. In the Tian Shan it is much wetter, precipitation often exceeding . Maximum temperatures in the Tarim Basin are about 40 °C (104 °F). The Tarim River freezes over every year from December through March.

==Course==
The Tarim River and most of its tributaries originate in the Karakorum and Kunlun Mountains. The name Tarim is applied to the river formed by the union of the Aksu River, flowing from the north, and Yarkand River, coming from the southwest, near the Aral City in western Xinjiang. A third river, the Khotan River, comes to the same junction area from the south but it is usually dry at this location, having crossed the Taklamakan Desert to get here. Another river of western Xinjiang is the Kashgar River, which flows into the Yarkand River during the rainy season about upstream from the Yarkand&#x27;s confluence with the Aksu.

The main source is the Yarkand River, which originates from the southeastern foot of the Telim Kanli Peak in the Karakoram Mountains. The source is divided into four branches, namely the Yeerqiang River, the Aksu River, the Kashgar River, and the Hotan River. The four rivers converge near Xiaojia in Awati County. In the &quot;Heyuan Jilue&quot; of the Qing dynasty, it is recorded as &quot;the meeting place is connected by four rivers. Shaped like a bullpen.&quot; Xiao Jacket is hereinafter referred to as the Tarim River. According to the calculation of the main source Yeerqiang River, the total length is 2327 kilometers. The main stream winds from west to east along the northern edge of the Tarim Basin at 41 degrees north latitude, and turns eastward to the southeast at 87 degrees east longitude, passing through the eastern part of the Taklimakan Desert, and finally injecting into Lop Nur, with a drainage area of 1.02 million. square kilometer. The main stream of the Tarim River is divided into upper, middle and lower sections: the upper section above Yangji Baza is the upper section, where the river bed is not bifurcated, the side erosion is strong, the meandering flow is developed, and the river bed is unstable; the middle section from Yangji Baza to Qunke, There are many forks, lakes and swamps here. During the flood period, the water flow overflows and disperses, and the main flow is often diverted; the lower section below Qunke, the river channel is restored and unified. The Daxihaizi Reservoir was built between Tieganlik, so only a small amount of river water could flow to Yingsu, and only during the flood period did water leak into Taitma Lake.

The Tarim flows in an eastward direction along the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert. It receives another tributary, the Muzat River from the north; however, out of these four rivers (Aksu, Yarkand, Khotan, and Muzart), only the Aksu flows into the Tarim year-round It is the Tarim&#x27;s most important tributary, supplying 70–80 percent of its water volume. Prior to the completion of reservoirs and irrigation works in the mid-20th century, the Tarim&#x27;s waters eventually reached Lop Nur (now a salt-encrusted lake bed). The 
river&#x27;s waters now drain intermittently into Taitema Lake, which is located about southwest of Lop Nur.

==Flora and fauna==

Vegetation in the Tarim Basin is mainly located along the river and its branches. There, at the edge of the sands, shrubs like vegetation and stunted trees, especially wormwood, are found. Tugay poplar forest grows in the Tarim River valley. Underbrush consists of willows, sea buckthorn, and dense growths of Indian hemp and Ural licorice.The river is rich in fish, and animal life on the river and the surrounding desert is varied. At the time of Sven Hedin&#x27;s visit in 1899, tigers were still being hunted and trapped along the rivers of the region and near Lop Nur. The valley and lakes of the Tarim are a stopover for many migratory birds.

The Tarim River is frequently diverted, the river has a large sediment content, and the erosion and deposition change frequently. The Tarim River Basin is a corridor-like distribution of the largest primitive &quot;Populus euphratica&quot; forest in the world. There are many sandy plants such as &quot;Haloxylon&quot;, licorice, tamarisk and camel thorn in the forest. Hundreds of wild animals such as Tarim red deer, wild Bactrian camels, goose-throated antelopes, whooper swans and egrets are raised. At present, the &quot;Populus euphratica&quot; forest belt in the lower reaches is disappearing continuously due to the cut-off of the Tarim River and the decrease of water volume. The Tarim River flows through the desert area, and the riverbed is generally silt and sandy loam, which is easily washed away. The upper and middle reaches of the river bed are generally more than 1 km wide, the widest is nearly 4 km, and the downstream river bed is generally 200–300 meters wide. The Tarim River is a primitive river with few dikes along the river, and it is allowed to overflow during flood periods. Wild plants grow densely in the floodplain area, including &quot;Populus euphratica&quot;, red willows and various pastures. In the middle reaches of the river, the terrain is gentle and there are many depressions, the water flow is scattered, interspersed with each other, the water network is disordered, the meanders are developed, and the water and grass lakes are connected.

==Human use==
The water quality at the outflow mountain pass of the four major sources of the Tarim River is grade 1-2, which can meet the requirements of living, agricultural irrigation and fishery. Due to the influence of geographical environment factors and farmland drainage, the water quality of the main stream is poor in non-flood seasons, and the salinity of the river water has exceeded the standard of saline-alkali areas, and the water quality category is inferior to 5. Floods generally occur in summer, and the period from May to September in high mountains is the period of melting snow in glaciers and high mountains. The annual average natural runoff of the Tarim River Basin is 39.83 billion cubic meters, mainly recharged by glaciers and snowmelt, the unique groundwater resources are 3.07 billion cubic meters, and the total water resources in the basin is 42.9 billion cubic meters. Since the 1950s, the natural runoff of the four major source and outflow mountain passes has shown an increasing trend. However, due to the increase in the irrigation area and water consumption in front of the source area, the amount of water supplied to the main stream of the Tarim River has decreased from 6 billion cubic meters in the 1950s to The 4.4 billion cubic meters at the beginning of the 21st century have decreased by an average of 320 million cubic meters per decade. From the 1980s to the beginning of the 21st century, the amount of water entering the Tarim River has been less than the average for many years.

Since the 1950s, although the natural inflow of water in each tributary has increased, due to the continuous increase in water consumption in the source area and the upper and middle reaches of the main stream, the water source of each tributary in the upper reaches of the Tarim River has been decreasing day by day, and the Kashgar River stopped inflow in the late 1950s; After the construction of the Bachu Xiaohaizi Reservoir in the 1960s, the discharge of the Yarkand River decreased sharply; except for the discharge of the Hetian River during the flood period, there was no water discharge in other periods. In the upper reaches of the lower reaches, the five farms of the Second Agricultural Division of the Production and Construction Corps rely on the sluices that block the river to bring all the water into the plains and reservoirs. As a result, the lower reaches of the lower reaches have become a desert. Taitma Lake is seasonally dry, and Lop Nur is completely dry. Since 2001, &quot;ecological water supply&quot; has been regularly implemented downstream to partially restore and maintain the downstream vegetation and ecological environment.

==History==
Some Chinese originally considered the Tarim to be the upper course of the Yellow River but, by the time of the Former Han dynasty (125 BCE–23 CE), it was known that it drains into Lop Nur, a series of salt lakes.

<text>The was the main gate built in the center of the south end of the imperial palaces in the Japanese ancient capitals of Fujiwara-kyō (Kashihara), Heijō-kyō (Nara), and later Heian-kyō (Kyoto). The placement followed the ancient Chinese palace model requirements at the time, where , the Vermilion Bird was the Guardian of the South. (&quot;See Four Symbols for more.&quot;)

It was said to be the site where foreign dignitaries were received by the Emperor. All of them were destroyed centuries ago along with the old imperial residences.

== Nara Suzakumon ==
In 1993, it was decided that the gate of Nara would be reconstructed. It proved extremely difficult to work out what Suzakumon had looked like, as there were no surviving structural remnants. A conjectural model was developed, based on comparable architecture elsewhere, and the new gate was constructed from a mixture of traditional building materials (Japanese cypress wood and tiles) and concrete, in order to resist earthquakes. The reconstructed gate was opened in 1998.

Most of the gate was constructed by the Takenaka Corporation.

<text>The Great Midwest Trivia Contest, or [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] [[Trivia]] Contest, is held once a year in Appleton, Wisconsin, broadcast over Twitch. It has a claim as the longest-running college bowl trivia contest. From 2006 to 2020, the contest was livestreamed by WLFM, Lawrence University&#x27;s internet radio station, which ceased FM broadcasting in 2006.

==Contest==
The contest begins at 10:00:37 p.m. on the Friday of the last full weekend in January. It ends at around midnight on Sunday for a total of approximately 50 consecutive hours. Students are appointed &quot;trivia masters&quot; and they administer the contest. Every year, a new lead trivia master, called the &quot;Head Master,&quot; is appointed by the previous Head Master. The Head Master has the final say on any disputes.

About 12 Trivia masters make up the questions, and teams are given 3 minutes to answer each question, which is done via telephone and Discord. Students volunteer to answer phones during all 50 hours of the contest. All teams that answer the question receive its points. Most questions are worth 5 points each. In the early years of the contest, teams researched using massive numbers of books; now teams find answers using computers on the internet. At the end of the contest, several difficult questions called are asked. Teams are given 10 minutes for the first two garrudas. The final, most difficult question – dubbed the &quot;Super Garruda&quot; – is worth 100 points and teams are given 30 minutes. The endeavor is governed by the Trivia Credo: &quot;Trivia is meant to be entertainment and should be perceived solely in that light.&quot; The teams with the highest scores are declared the winners in on-campus and off-campus categories, receiving prizes such as pink plastic flamingos and stainless-steel bedpans. The Great Midwest Trivia Contest is known as the &quot;World&#x27;s Longest Running Trivia Contest&quot; because of its custom of having the university&#x27;s president ask the previous year&#x27;s Super Garruda as the first question of the next year&#x27;s contest.

Questions used in the past include &quot;What was Holden Caulfield&#x27;s middle name?&quot; and &quot;In 2004, which nation drank the most coffee per capita?&quot; (The answers are &quot;Morrisey&quot; and &quot;Finland,&quot; respectively.) The 2009 Super Garruda was &quot;Who was going to be married next to what was the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Cedar Bucket&quot; in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in June 2005, before it mysteriously burned down the week before the wedding date?&quot; (answer: James Walters and Jaki Neubauer). In modern times, internet access has changed the way questions are written. Examples from the 2024 contest include &quot;This primate was named after an anarchist critical of a linguist who shares a surname with the Simpsons character who said &quot;steamed hams&quot;. What was the longest sentence the primate ever said?&quot; and &quot;This state house&#x27;s original dome was metal-plated by the founding father who rides alongside the protagonist of Assassin&#x27;s Creed III. What lies in its House of Representatives chamber, whose speaker pro tempore shares a last name with the ring name of the wrestler who had a cameo in Rocky III?&quot; (&quot;Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you&quot; and &quot;Sacred Cod,&quot; respectively) On-campus teams are occasionally asked to do special action questions such as composing a love song or doing a dance routine based on a theme.

==History==
The contest was founded in 1966 by James Bailey deRosset as an alternate for a serious academic retreat with professors (called &quot;Encampment Weekend&quot;). deRosset visited his girlfriend at Beloit College; he was disappointed with Beloit&#x27;s trivia contest and had ideas on how he wanted to improve on their contest. deRosset spoke with his friend, Junior Dave Pfleger, who worked at WLFM and arranged airtime. The first contest consisted of questions in four categories (television, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music, comic books, and movies) that were written by deRosset and his friends. The first question asked in 1966 was &quot;Who was Superman&#x27;s father?&quot; (answer Jor-El). The first winners received a broken refrigerator as their prize.

It may be the oldest college-based radio trivia contest in the United States. Lawrence&#x27;s inaugural edition on April 29, 1966, predates both the presumed May debut of the biannual Williams College Trivia Contest by a week or so and the February 1969 debut of the Stevens Point Media Trivia Contest by three years. However, the precise date of the first Williams contest is not known; before its playing schedule was standardized, spring semester Williams Trivia games were sometimes held as early as February and March.

Teams originally had to be within about to receive the FM signal for WLFM. The radio station changed to internet broadcast and the first internet-only contest was held in 2006.

The 50th annual contest was held in 2015 and it featured teams as far away as Sweden. The question difficulty had grown significantly because the teams could quickly find answers to simple questions using Google and the internet. Several Head Masters and deRosset returned for the contest. The contest had amassed over 18,000 questions in 2450 hours of competition by the end of the 2014 contest. The 50th contest featured one question per hour taken from a previous contest.

The 56th annual contest was held in 2021, and was held virtually instead of on WLFM radio as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The contest was streamed via Twitch. Contestants submitted results via a Discord phone answering system as well as a Google form instead of solely via telephone. This method continued to be used for the 57th contest.

The 58th annual contest was held in 2023 and saw the erection of the &quot;Trivia Flag&quot; on the cupola of Lawrence University&#x27;s Main Hall, an ode to the year&#x27;s theme: pirates.

==References in popular media==
The Lawrence trivia contest has been written about in &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Washington Post, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and most of the newspapers in Wisconsin. The 1984 Head Trivia Master, John Landis, &#x27;84, appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Good Morning America&quot;.&quot; Paul Harvey asked a question in the 1978 contest: &quot;I’m Paul Harvey. Now, for five trivia points where is the International Armadillo Confab and Exposition held? Gooooood Day!&quot; The answer was Victoria, Texas.

<text>Serge D. Aubin (born February 15, 1975) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and a former professional ice hockey centre who played 374 games in the National Hockey League for the Colorado Avalanche, Columbus Blue Jackets and Atlanta Thrashers. He is currently serving as head coach of Eisbären Berlin in the German DEL.

==Playing career==
Aubin was drafted in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, in the 7th round, 161st overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins. He spent his junior years playing in the QMJHL, playing for the Drummondville Voltigeurs and the Granby Bisons. Until 1999, Aubin was mostly playing for the NHL&#x27;s farm league, having only played one NHL game for the Colorado Avalanche. He spent time with the Hampton Roads Admirals of the ECHL and in the AHL with the Syracuse Crunch and the Hershey Bears.

After playing 15 more regular season games and 17 playoff games for Colorado, Aubin moved to the Columbus Blue Jackets as a free agent on July 11, 2000. It was with the Blue Jackets where Aubin had his best season in 2000–01, scoring 13 goals and 17 assists for 30 points and only missed one game the entire season. After another season with Columbus, he was brought back to Colorado, but after just one season, Aubin was claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers in the NHL waiver draft. In the 2003–04 he scored 25 points, 5 short of his NHL career best in scoring.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, which resulted in the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season, Aubin played in Switzerland for Genève-Servette HC. Aubin returned to the Thrashers for the 2005–06 season, his last in the NHL. He returned to Geneva for the 2006–07 season. After the season ended for HC Genève-Servette, he was hired by EHC Biel to play in the Nationalliga B playoff finals and in a possible promotion series. Aubin was named captain of the Canadian team for the 2007 Spengler Cup, he signed than on 7 April 2009 by HC Fribourg-Gottéron.

Following a Quarterfinal defeat in the 2010–11 season, Aubin left Fribourg as a free agent and signed a two-year contract with Deutsche Eishockey Liga club, the Hamburg Freezers, on March 28, 2011. In 46 games, Aubin produced a respectable 31 points. With his veteran experience and leadership a positive for the Freezers, Aubin returned to play in the following pre-season European Tournament, however after suffering a severe thumb injury Aubin was unable to play for the Freezers in the 2012–13 season and announced his retirement on January 15, 2013.

==Coaching career==
Aubin was then named an assistant coach for the Freezers, beginning the 2013–14 season. In the following season he replaced Benoit Laporte on September 25, 2014, and took over head coaching responsibilities. In November 2014, he was named to the coaching staff of the Canadian Men&#x27;s National Team for the Deutschland Cup, serving as assistant to head coach Jeff Tomlinson. One year later, Aubin served as an assistant coach for the German Men&#x27;s National Team at the Deutschland Cup. In January 2015, he signed a contract extension, that would keep him in Hamburg until 2017. However, the Freezers organization folded in May 2016, which ended Aubin&#x27;s coaching tenure in Hamburg.

On June 7, 2016, Aubin was named head coach of the Vienna Capitals of the Austrian Hockey League. He guided the team to the championship in his first year as coach. On December 29, 2017, the ZSC Lions of the National League announced that Aubin would take over the head coaching job at ZSC starting with the 2018–19 season. He was sacked on January 14, 2019 because under his guidance, the team did not develop as the club leaders had hoped for. In May 2019, he signed a two-year deal as head coach of German DEL team Eisbären Berlin.

<doc id="540219" wikidata="Q3487258" url="?curid=540219" title="Runabout (Star Trek)">
<text>Runabouts (&quot;&quot;Danube&quot;-class&quot; vessels) are a fictional class of small, multi-purpose starships appearing in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science-fiction franchise, primarily the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, which aired on syndicated television between 1993 and 1999. They served as a means of transport for the crew of the fictional space station Deep Space Nine, in the early seasons of the series enabling storylines taking place away from the station.

This spacecraft design was created primarily by Herman Zimmerman, Rick Sternbach and Jim Martin in the 1990s for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and later used throughout the franchise such as in books, comics, and games.

==Role in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;==
The idea for a ship based on a runabout was prompted by the need to provide a way for characters to travel away from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, allowing the series to feature &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s themes of exploration and discovery despite being set on a stationary space station. In order to help the new show establish its own identity separate from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, the decision was made to have something larger and more capable than the shuttlecraft seen in previous series of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

The series bible describes the &quot;Danube&quot;-class vessels as &quot;the symbol of the Federation presence in [&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;″s] sector&quot;. The Starfleet design elements were intended as a touch of familiarity for the characters (and in turn, the viewers) in environments dominated by alien designs and structures, specifically the Cardassians and Bajorans.

From the third season of &quot;DS9&quot; onwards, much of the exploration aspect of the series was facilitated by the starship USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, which took over much of the runabouts&#x27; previous role in allowing characters to move off the station. &quot;Defiant&quot; was introduced because the producers wanted the series to enable more than two or three characters to travel away from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; at once, while the introduction of the Dominion as an antagonist during the second season created the in-universe requirement for a more powerful and combat-capable starship based at &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

==Design and depiction==
Overall design of the runabout was supervised by Herman Zimmerman, with Rick Sternbach and Jim Martin responsible for the design work. According to Sternbach, initial designs for the Danube class were based on the &#x27;Spacedock Ferry&#x27; that appeared in the film &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;.

The &quot;Danube&quot;-class vessels are larger than shuttlecraft seen in previous series of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but significantly smaller than previously depicted starships. The runabouts are usually named after rivers on Earth.

The hull of the &quot;Danube&quot;-class runabout is shaped roughly like a long, rectangular box. A downward-curving &#x27;wing&#x27; is located on each side of the vessel; these start near the top of the hull, and curve down to the warp nacelles. The runabout&#x27;s impulse drives are located between the wings and the vessel&#x27;s body. The &quot;Deep Space Nine Technical Manual&quot; gives the runabout&#x27;s dimensions as long, wide, and high.

The runabouts have a two-person flight crew, and can carry two other crew. They are fitted with a two-person transporter and accommodation bunks for long missions. According to the first season episode &quot;Dax&quot;, they were capable of speeds up to Warp 5. Although not explored in the series, background materials indicate the runabout had a modular mission payload system, where the middle section of the runabout could be swapped out for modules carrying different equipment.

===Sets===
The cockpit set was designed by Joseph Hodges, and constructed over a nine-week period. The set was laid out with the two flight crew facing forward and out the windows, while consoles for the two other crew have them facing the sides of the runabout. The runabout&#x27;s transporter was located in the centre rear of the compartment.

A remodeling of the set occurred between the second and third seasons, with the primary change being new computer consoles around the cockpit. Another major overhaul occurred between seasons four and five, with the transporter bay moved aft behind a large door (which was usually kept open), and a free-standing console added in its place.

The set was redressed on four occasions to serve as the control areas of other vessels: a Maquis raider during &quot;Caretaker&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, mirror universe ships in &quot;DS9&quot; season three episode &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; and season four episode &quot;Shattered Mirror&quot;, and a shuttlecraft from USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E in the film &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;.

A set for the runabout&#x27;s aft living quarters was built for &quot;Timescape&quot;, an episode in the sixth season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; (running concurrently with &quot;DS9&quot;″s first season). The set was designed by Richard James, and was funded from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s budget, in order to take pressure off &quot;DS9&quot;″s finances. Unlike the cockpit construction, design and fabrication of the aft set had to be completed in nine days. This was the only appearance of the &quot;Danube&quot; class outside of &quot;DS9&quot;, and although the set was intended for use on &quot;DS9&quot;, it was never used again to depict a runabout&#x27;s interior.

===Filming models===

The filming model was built by Tony Meininger. Filming of the runabout was done by Image G, along with all other miniature effect work for the series.

One runabout, USS &quot;Ganges&quot;, appeared in season one episode &quot;Past Prologue&quot; with a &#x27;roll-bar&#x27; mounted over the top of the ship. This roll-bar, described as containing sensor equipment, was added to the model to help viewers distinguish between &quot;Ganges&quot; and the runabout USS &quot;Yangtzee Kiang&quot; during a chase sequence.

Eight subsequent episodes of &quot;DS9&quot; show &quot;Danube-&quot;class ships with roll-bars, including second season episode &quot;The Maquis, Part II&quot;, where two runabouts with roll-bars are depicted flying alongside a third, without the roll-bar. A prototype for an updated runabout design, the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; class, appears in an alternate timeline depicted in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Non Sequitur&quot;. This episode used stock footage from various &quot;DS9&quot; episodes; incongruously, the runabout&#x27;s destruction depicts the vessel with a roll-bar, while all previous scenes show the vessel without one.

Season six episode &quot;One Little Ship&quot; had a runabout carrying Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), and Miles O&#x27;Brien (Colm Meaney) shrunk down to tiny size, then having to rescue the rest of the cast when &quot;Defiant&quot; is captured by the Dominion. Screenwriter René Echevarria conceived the &#x27;little ship show&#x27; idea as a comedic filler episode early in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s run, but despite suggesting it multiple times, did not receive the chance to go ahead until late in &quot;DS9&quot;″s run. Meiniger built a new, -long runabout model: dialogue in the episode specified that the runabout had shrunk to , but a model that small would have had problems with lighting and detail. The model was mounted on a specially built three-axis head, which allowed for easier miniature effect work than with the original filming model.

===Computer-generated imagery model===
The first CGI ship ever used in the Star Trek franchise was created by Dennis Blakey and Dorene Haver at VisionArt. It was a 3D computer model of the &quot;Runabout&quot; shuttle for Star Trek: The Next Generation. Previously, Star Trek had exclusively used physical models, which at the time were composited by Adam Howard and Steve Scott at Digital Magic. VisionArt&#x27;s 3D model of the Runabout was primarily used for the stretching effect when it jumped to warp.

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season six episode &quot;Change of Heart&quot; later depicted a runabout traversing an asteroid field, then landing on a planet. This was the first episode in which runabout sequences were done completely with computer-generated imagery: complex scenes where the ship weaved through the dense asteroid field were achieved without weeks of miniature effect work, and camera movements during the landing sequence allowed the runabout to be shown from multiple angles in the same scene, as there was no need to conceal a &#x27;mounting point&#x27; for the miniature. The CGI model for the &quot;Danube&quot; class was developed by Digital Muse.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Danube&quot; class===
Named ships not known to be destroyed are in boldface
===&quot;Yellowstone&quot; class (alternate reality)===
==Disposability==
A large number of runabouts are damaged or destroyed over the course of the series. In the third-season episode &quot;Family Business&quot;, Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) quips, &quot;The rate we go through runabouts, it&#x27;s a good thing the Earth has so many rivers&quot; (referencing the naming tradition of the &quot;Danube&quot;-class vessels), and in &quot;Star Trek 101&quot;, authors Terry Erdmann and Paula Block comment that the series &quot;goes through runabouts like potato chips&quot;.

The show&#x27;s art department joked that any runabout travel should be done on the USS &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, referring to its distinction as the only &quot;Danube&quot;-class ship to survive the entire seven-season run of &quot;DS9&quot;, and therefore the safest one. It appeared in the series pilot &quot;Emissary&quot;, the final episode &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, and eighteen other episodes in between.

==Merchandise==
* In 1993, AMT/Ertl released a 1:72 scale model kit for the runabout USS &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. During the filming of season two, one of these models was put together by the show&#x27;s art department for a miniature effect shot where a runabout exploded, instead of having to assemble, then destroy, a more-expensive filming model. Later, the company released a 1:2500 scale model of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; itself, which included three runabouts to place on the station&#x27;s landing pads.

* In 1994, Playmates Toys released a &quot;Runabout &quot;Orinoco&quot;&quot; playset, in which two of Playmates&#x27; action figures could be seated.

* A runabout was amongst the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Micro Machines produced by Galoob. As well as the standard toy, bronzed and silvered versions have been released in collectors&#x27; sets.

* Several &#x27;ship&#x27; cards from Decipher, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek Customizable Card Game&quot; depicted &quot;Danube&quot;-class ships. A generic Runabout card (based on the appearance in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;) was included in the original set, with named runabouts appearing in subsequent sets.

* Runabouts appear in several incarnations in the &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; massively multiplayer online role-playing game. &quot;Danube&quot; and &quot;Yellowstone&quot; classes appear as both playable &#x27;small craft&#x27; starships and as decorative non-combat pets to be displayed when using larger starships. The &quot;Danube&quot;-class starship and pet correspond to the &quot;DS9&quot; appearance, with the roll bar equipped. However, the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; runabouts have a different visual design to the ship&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

== Reception ==
In 2017, CBR ranked the runabout the fifteenth most powerful spacecraft of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. They note they were an important vessel in the television show early on before the arrival of the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; spacecraft. They felt they were a big upgrade over smaller shuttlecraft of the period, and while they land the occasionally lucky shot against larger starships, they were no match for them in general.

<doc id="540223" wikidata="Q1345705" url="?curid=540223" title="Little St Bernard Pass">
<text>The Little St Bernard Pass (French: &quot;Col du Petit Saint-Bernard&quot;, Italian: &quot;Colle del Piccolo San Bernardo&quot;) is a mountain pass in the Alps on the France–Italy border. Its saddle is at 2188 metres above sea level. It is located between Savoie, France, and Aosta Valley, Italy, to the south of the Mont Blanc Massif, exactly on the main alpine watershed. There is also a Great St. Bernard Pass, famous for giving the St Bernard breed its name, and a San Bernardino Pass.

The road across this pass (D1090 from Bourg-Saint-Maurice via La Rosiere in France; SS26 from the Aosta Valley via La Thuile in Italy) is usually open from May to October. For current road status see &quot;Etat des principaux cols routiers francais&quot;.

At the summit, the road cuts through a stone circle measuring 72 m (236 ft) in diameter. A standing stone once stood in the middle. From coin finds this is believed to date from the Iron Age, possibly being a ceremonial site of the Tarentaisian culture (c. 725 BC–450 BC). The stone circle was partly restored in the 19th century.

In the Roman era, a temple dedicated to Jupiter was erected nearby along with a mansio serving travellers along the pass, and it is thought that Carthaginian general Hannibal used this route.

==Tour de France==
The Little St Bernard Pass was first crossed by the Tour de France in 1949 and has been featured three times since. In 2007, Montée d&#x27;Hauteville was climbed on stage 8 of the Tour de France. The pass was featured in the 2009 Tour de France Stage 16 on 21 July from Martigny (Switzerland) to Bourg-Saint-Maurice, 160 km, which also features the Great St Bernard Pass.

===Route===
From Bourg-Saint-Maurice to the south-west, the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard is 26.5 km long. Over this distance, the climb is 1,348 m (4,423 ft) (an average slope of 5.1%), with the steepest sections at 8.1% at the start of the climb. The first 15.5 km (9.6 mi) to La Rosière forms the Montée d&#x27;Hauteville climb.

From Pré-Saint-Didier (in the Aosta Valley region of north-western Italy), the pass is 23.5 km (14.6 mi) long. Over this distance the climb is 1,184 m (3,885 ft) (an average slope of 5%).

<doc id="540226" wikidata="Q5140942" url="?curid=540226" title="Coffee ground vomiting">
<text>Coffee ground vomitus refers to a particular appearance of vomit. Within organic heme molecules of red blood cells is the element iron, which oxidizes following exposure to gastric acid. This reaction causes the vomitus to look black like coffee grounds. 

==Causes==
Esophagitis, esophageal varices, gastritis, cirrhosis or gastric ulcers for example, may bleed and produce coffee-ground vomitus. When unaccompanied by melena, hematemesis or a fall in hemoglobin with corresponding urea rises and creates an unstable reaction, and other causes of coffee ground vomitus need to be elucidated; for example, gastric stasis, bowel obstruction or ileus, that can cause oxidised food material to be vomited. Vomiting iron supplements can also mimic coffee grounds to the untrained eye.

Diseases such as Ebola, yellow fever, viral hepatitis, haemophilia B, fatty liver disease and cancers of stomach, pancreas, esophagus and, rarely, retrograde jejunogastric intussusception might also be the reason behind coffee-ground vomitus.

When attributed to peptic inflammation, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is commonly implicated. These drugs can interfere with the stomach&#x27;s natural defenses against the strongly acidic environment, causing damage to the mucosa that can result in bleeding. Therefore, it is recommended that these class of drugs be taken with food or on a full stomach. Other causes of inflammation may be due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; gastritis, portal hypertensive gastropathy or malignancy.

When bright red blood is vomited, it is termed hematemesis. Hematemesis, in contrast to coffee ground vomitus, suggests that upper gastrointestinal bleeding is more acute or more severe, for example due to a Mallory–Weiss tear, gastric ulcer or Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion, or esophageal varices. This condition may be a medical emergency and urgent care may be required.

Oxidized blood from an upper gastrointestinal bleed can also be excreted in stool. It produces blackened, &quot;tarry&quot; stools known as melena.

== Evaluation ==
Upper endoscopy can be used to locate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal system. In this method a camera is inserted through the mouth to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.

Numerous studies have suggested that urgent endoscopy is not required for coffee ground emesis alone. Other factors, such as hemodynamic stability, hemoglobin concentration, and various elements of the patient&#x27;s history may guide clinicians to obtain or defer urgent endoscopy. Additionally, nasogastric aspirates can be used to predict the likelihood that endoscopy will reveal high-risk bleeding.

While endoscopic visualization may be sufficient for diagnosis, a biopsy may also be taken during endoscopy, aiding in the diagnosis of H. pylori infections, and differentiating tumors.

CT angiography may also be used to locate the source of upper-GI bleeding.

== Management ==
Treatment of coffee ground emesis depends on underlying etiology. Patient history and initial labs, especially hemoglobin, can help stratify patients by need for immediate intervention.

Bleeding ulcers believed to be caused by H. pylori infections are typically treated with a combination of medications. Medications used in the treatment of such ulcers fall into two categories. First, medications are used to decrease pain associated with ulcers by limiting acid exposure to sensitive ulcers. This can be accomplished by medications that reduce stomach acid production, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or H2-blockers, or through conventional antacids. Sucralfate is also effective in this role, as it coats the ulcer, thus protecting it from caustic stomach acid. Second, antibiotic therapy is used to eliminate the underlying bacterial infection. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are commonly used in tandem, but antibiotic regiments may vary based on organism susceptibility, side effects, and patient allergies. Gastric ulcers caused by NSAID use can be treated with NSAID cessation, or a proton pump inhibitor if cessation is not possible. Non-healing ulcers should be examined for other causes, such as cancer or Zollinger-Elison syndrome.

Esophageal bleeding is predominantly caused by gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD). PPI medications are preferred to H2-blocking medication due to increased rates of patient improvement, though both medications are commonly used. Severe cases of GERD may be refractory to these medications and require fundoplication, a surgery in which the gastroesophageal junction is surgically reinforced. While lifestyle modifications, diet modification, and antacid use may reduce GERD symptoms such as heartburn, these methods are not sufficient to heal esophageal ulcers.

Variceal bleeding may be treated through a variety of medications and interventions, depending on underlying causes and severity. Severe cases are unlikely to present as coffee ground emesis, and are more likely to present as bright red vomitus.

Esophageal lacerations (Mallory-Weiss tears) are mostly self-limiting, though the majority require blood transfusions to compensate for blood loss. Endoscopic interventions, including epinephrine injections, clipping, and cauterization may be utilized if needed.

<text>The Senne is a natural region in the Regierungsbezirk of Detmold, in the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen in west-central Germany. It lies to the west of the Teutoburger Forest, and has an area of approximately . It lies between the cities of Bielefeld to the north-west, Detmold to the north-east, and Paderborn to the south.

Heath, calcareous grassland, and moorland cover most of the area. The river Ems arises here. Flora and fauna are very rich in the Senne, 901 of the 5000 animal and plant species are listed on the IUCN Red List.

116 km2 of the Senne and therefore more than the half of it area are taken by the Sennelager Training Area, which is mainly used by British forces. By 2020 all of the planned reductions in British forces had been completed, which now leaves the future of this landscape undecided.

== Fauna ==

The region is the home of a criticallyendangered breed of riding horse, the Senner, which is believed to be the oldest breed of riding horse in Germany, and is documented at least as far back as 1160. It lived in feral herds in the moorlands and in the Teutoburger Forest to the east. In 1999, some were introduced to the nature reserve to assist in conservation grazing.

<text>The &#x27; (French, ) or &#x27; (Dutch, ) is a small river that flows through Brussels, Belgium. Its source is in the village of Naast near the municipality of Soignies. It is an indirect tributary of the Scheldt, through the Dyle and the Rupel. It joins the Dyle at Zennegat in Battel, north of the municipality of Mechelen, only a few hundred metres before the Dyle itself joins the Rupel.

In total, the Senne is long. The Woluwe and the Maalbeek are some of its tributaries.

==Covering and treatment==


In Brussels, the Senne had become a serious health hazard by the second half of the 19th century, and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of the city&#x27;s then-mayor, Jules Anspach, its entire course through the urban area was completely covered over. This allowed urban renewal and the construction of modern buildings of &quot;Haussmann-esque&quot; style along grand central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. The river is still visible in the outskirts of Brussels and outside the urban area, though within the city, it now runs mostly underneath the Small Ring (Brussels&#x27; inner ring road).

The Senne was notorious for being one of Belgium&#x27;s worst polluted rivers, despite work done to the sewers and spillways in the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, since all effluents from the Brussels-Capital Region emptied into it without treatment. The drainage into the canal was not able to completely stop the floods that regularly affected certain outer areas of the city. In March 2007, the completion of new sewage treatment plants began to remediate this problem. However, in December 2009, the Brussels-North treatment plant of Aquiris was temporarily and abruptly shut down, creating a political and ecological crisis.

==Cultural impact==
The yellow iris became used as the emblem of the Brussels-Capital Region due to its habitat in the marshy plains around the river and a stylised version is featured on its official flag. The unique seasonal wild yeasts of the Senne river valley are used in the production of the regional lambic style of beer. Brasserie de la Senne is a brewery named for the river.

Despite the covering of the Senne resulting in the river being all but invisible in central Brussels, it has had a cultural impact on the city. A nickname for residents of the city, &quot;zinneke&quot;, meaning &quot;mutt&quot; or &quot;bastard&quot; in Brusselian dialect, is taken from the stray dogs that hung around the streets by the Lesser Senne (a tangent canal of the river) until the end of the 19th century. The name was revived at the start of the 21st century with the creation of the Zinneke Parade, a multicultural biennial event in Brussels, as well as &quot;Het Zinneke&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Zinneke Pis&quot;, a bronze sculpture depicting an urinating dog.

<text>Maude Ewing Adams Kiskadden (November 11, 1872 – July 17, 1953), known professionally as Maude Adams, was an American actress and stage designer who achieved her greatest success as the character Peter Pan, first playing the role in the 1905 Broadway production of &quot;Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;. Adams&#x27;s personality appealed to a large audience and helped her become the most successful and highest-paid performer of her day, with a yearly income of more than $1 million during her peak.

Adams began performing as a child while accompanying her actress mother on tour. At the age of 16, she made her Broadway debut, and under Charles Frohman&#x27;s management, she became a popular player alongside leading man John Drew Jr. in the early 1890s. Beginning in 1897, Adams starred in plays by J. M. Barrie, including &quot;The Little Minister&quot;, &quot;Quality Street&quot;, &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. These productions made Adams the most popular actress in America. Her work on these shows&#x27; production design and innovative technical lighting helped to make them a success, and she was named as inventor on three light bulb patents. She also performed in a number of other plays. Her last Broadway play, in 1916, was Barrie&#x27;s &quot;A Kiss for Cinderella&quot;. After a 13-year retirement, she appeared in more Shakespeare plays and then taught acting in Missouri. She retired to upstate New York.

==Early life and career==

Adams was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, the daughter of Asaneth Ann &quot;Annie&quot; (née Adams) and James Henry Kiskadden. Adams&#x27;s mother was an actress, and her father had jobs working for a bank and in a mine. Little else is known about Adams&#x27;s father, who died when she was young. James was not a Mormon, and Adams once wrote of her father as having been a &quot;gentile&quot;. The surname &quot;Kiskadden&quot; is Scottish. On her mother&#x27;s side, Adams&#x27;s great-grandfather Platt Banker converted to Mormonism and moved his family to Missouri, where his daughter Julia married Barnabus Adams. Barnabus and Julia then migrated as part of the first company to enter the Salt Lake Valley with Brigham Young in 1847, where he cut timbers for the Salt Lake Tabernacle. Adams was also a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Howland.

Adams appeared on stage at two months old in the play &quot;The Lost Baby&quot; at the Salt Lake City Brigham Young Theatre. She appeared again at the age of nine months in her mother&#x27;s arms. Over her father&#x27;s objections, Adams began acting as a small child, adopting her mother&#x27;s maiden name as her stage name. They toured throughout the western U.S. with a theatrical troupe that played in rural areas, mining towns and some cities. At the age of five, Adams starred in a San Francisco theater as &quot;Little Schneider&quot; in &quot;Fritz, Our German Cousin&quot; and as &quot;Adrienne Renaud&quot; in &quot;A Celebrated Case&quot;. At the age of nine, Adams lived with her Mormon grandmother and Mormon cousins in Salt Lake City while her mother remained in San Francisco. It is not clear whether she identified as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as her mother did. She was never baptized as a Presbyterian, although she attended a Presbyterian school. Later in life, Adams took long sabbaticals in Catholic convents, and in 1922 she donated her estates in Lake Ronkonkoma, New York, to the Sisters of the Cenacle for use as a novitiate and retreat house. She never converted to Catholicism or discussed the topic in any interviews.

Adams debuted in New York at the age of ten in &quot;Esmeralda&quot; and then returned briefly to California. She then returned to Salt Lake City to live with her grandmother and studied at the Salt Lake Collegiate Institute. She later wrote of Salt Lake City: &quot;The people of the valley have gentle manners, as if their spirits moved with dignity.&quot; Adams also later wrote the short essay &quot;The One I Knew Least&quot;, where she described her difficulty in discovering her personality because of playing so many theatrical roles as a child.

==Early adult career==

Adams returned to New York City at the age of 16 to appear in &quot;The Paymaster&quot;. She then became a member of E. H. Sothern&#x27;s theatre company in Boston, appearing in &quot;The Highest Bidder&quot;, and then was on Broadway in &quot;Lord Chumley&quot; in 1888. Charles H. Hoyt then cast her in &quot;A Midnight Bell&quot; where audiences, if not the critics, took notice of her. In 1889, sensing he had a potential new star on his hands, Hoyt offered her a five-year contract, but Adams declined in favor of a lesser offer from the powerful producer Charles Frohman who, from that point forward, took control of her career. She soon left behind juvenile parts and began to play leading roles for Frohman, often alongside her mother. In 1890, Frohman asked David Belasco and Henry C. de Mille to specially write the part of Dora Prescott for Adams in their new play &quot;Men and Women&quot;, which Frohman was producing. The next year, she appeared as Nell in &quot;The Lost Paradise&quot;.

In 1892, John Drew Jr. (one of the leading stars of the day) ended his 18-year association with Augustin Daly and joined Frohman&#x27;s company. Frohman paired Adams and Drew in a series of plays beginning with &quot;The Masked Ball&quot; and ending with &quot;Rosemary&quot; in 1896. She then spent five years as the leading lady in John Drew&#x27;s company. There, according to historian Ann Engar, &quot;her work was praised for its charm, delicacy, and simplicity.&quot; &quot;The Masked Ball&quot; opened on October 8, 1892. Audiences came to see its star, Drew, but left remembering Adams. Most memorable was a scene in which her character feigned tipsiness for which she received a two-minute ovation on opening night. Drew was the star, but it was for Adams that the audience gave twelve curtain calls, and previously tepid critics gave generous reviews. &quot;Harpers Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;It is difficult to see just who is going to prevent Miss Adams from becoming the leading exponent of light comedy in America. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Adams, &quot;not John Drew, has made the success of &quot;The Masked Ball&quot; at Palmer&#x27;s, and is the star of the comedy. Manager Charles Frohman, in attempting to exploit one star, has happened upon another of greater magnitude.&quot; The tipsy scene started Adams on her path to being a favorite among New York audiences and led to an eighteen-month run for the play.

Less successful plays followed, including &quot;The Butterflies&quot;, &quot;The Bauble Shop&quot;, &quot;Christopher, Jr.&quot;, &quot;The Imprudent Young Couple&quot; and &quot;The Squire of Dames&quot;. But 1896 saw an upturn for Adams with &quot;Rosemary, That&#x27;s for Remembrance&quot;. A comedy about the elopement of a young couple, sheltered for the night by an older man (Drew), the play received critical praise and box office success.

==Barrie and stardom==

Frohman had been pursuing J. M. Barrie (the future author of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;) to adapt the author&#x27;s popular book &quot;The Little Minister&quot; into a play, but Barrie had resisted because he felt there was no actress who could play Lady Babbie. On a trip to New York in 1896, Barrie attended a performance of &quot;Rosemary&quot; and at once decided that Adams was the actress to play Lady Babbie. Frohman worried that the masculine aspects of the book might overshadow Adams&#x27;s role. With Barrie&#x27;s consent, several key scenes were changed to favor Lady Babbie. The play opened in 1897 at the Empire Theatre and was a tremendous success, running for 300 performances in New York (289 of which were standing room only) and setting a new all-time box office record of $370,000; it made Adams a star. It also toured successfully, running for 65 performances in Boston.

Another play by Barrie, &quot;Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; (1904), became the role with which Adams was most closely identified. She was the first actress to play Peter Pan on Broadway. Only days after her casting was announced, Adams had an emergency appendectomy, and it was uncertain whether her health would allow her to assume the role as planned. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; opened on October 16, 1905 at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. to little success. It soon moved to Broadway, where the play had a long run. Adams appeared in the role on Broadway several times over the following decade. The collar of her 1905 Peter Pan costume, which she had co-designed, was an immediate fashion success and was henceforth known as the &quot;Peter Pan collar&quot;.

Adams starred in other works by Barrie, including &quot;Quality Street&quot; (1901), &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; (1908), &quot;The Legend of Leonora&quot; (1914) and &quot;A Kiss for Cinderella&quot; (1916). In 1899, she portrayed Shakespeare&#x27;s Juliet. While audiences responded to her performance with standing ovations, critics generally disliked it. The critic Alan Dale, reviewing her debut in the role at the Empire Theatre, called her Elizabethan English &quot;grotesque at times&quot; and commented that Adams had performed with &quot;pretty purring&quot;, not classical. On the other hand, he described her performance as &quot;romantic&quot;, &quot;sublime&quot; and &quot;not sinking beneath the waves.&quot; Audiences loved her in the role, selling out the 16 performances in New York. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was followed by &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; in 1900, a French play about the life of Napoleon II of France in which Adams played the leading role, foreshadowing her portrayal of another male (Peter Pan) five years later. The play had starred Sarah Bernhardt in Paris with enthusiastic reviews, but Adams&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; received mixed reviews in New York. In 1909, she played Joan of Arc in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;. This was produced on a huge scale at the Harvard University Stadium by Adams. The June 24, 1909 edition of the &quot;Paducah Evening Sun&quot; (Kentucky) contains the following excerpt:

Joan at Harvard, Schiller&#x27;s Play reproduced on Gigantic scale. ... The experiment of producing Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Maid of Orleans&quot; beneath starry skies … was carried out [by] Adams and a company numbering about two thousand persons ... at the Harvard Stadium. ... A special electric light plant was installed ... a great cathedral was erected, background constructed and a realistic forest created. ... Miss Adams was accorded an ovation at the end of the performance.

She appeared in another French play with 1911&#x27;s &quot;Chantecler&quot;, the story of a rooster who believes his crowing makes the sun rise. She fared only slightly better than in &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; with the critics, but audiences again embraced her, on one occasion giving her 22 curtain calls. Adams later cited it as her favorite role, with Peter Pan a close second.

==Later years and death==
Adams retired in 1918 after a severe bout of influenza. During the 1920s, she worked with General Electric to patent improved and more powerful stage lighting, (, , ) and with the Eastman Company, to develop color photography. It has been suggested that her motivation for her association with these technology companies was that she wished to appear in a color film version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and this would have required better lighting and techniques for color photography. Her electric lights ultimately became the industry standard in Hollywood with the advent of sound in motion pictures in the late 1920s. After 13 years away from the stage, she returned to acting, appearing occasionally in regional productions of Shakespeare plays, including as Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in Ohio, in 1931, and as Maria in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 1934 in Maine.

Often described as shy, Adams was described by Ethel Barrymore as the &quot;original &#x27;I want to be alone&#x27; woman&quot;. Her retiring lifestyle, including the absence of any relationships with men, contributed to the virtuous and innocent public image promoted by Frohman and was reflected in her most successful roles. Biographers have concluded that Adams was a lesbian. She had two long-term relationships that ended upon her partners&#x27; deaths: Lillie Florence, from the early 1890s until 1901, and Louise Boynton from 1905 until 1951. Adams was known to sometimes supplement fellow performers&#x27; salaries from her own pay. Once, while she was touring, a theater owner significantly raised the price of tickets, knowing Adams&#x27;s name meant a sold-out house. Adams made the owner refund the difference before she appeared on the stage that night. Adams was the head of the drama department at Stephens College in Missouri from 1937 to 1949, becoming known as an inspiring acting teacher.

After her retirement, Adams was on occasion pursued for roles in film. The closest she came to accepting was in 1938, when producer David O. Selznick persuaded her to do a screen test (with Janet Gaynor, who later played the female lead) for the role of Miss Fortune in the film &quot;The Young in Heart&quot;. After negotiations failed, the role was played by Minnie Dupree. The 12-minute screen test was preserved by the George Eastman House in 2004.

She died, aged 80, at her summer home, Caddam Hill, in Tannersville, New York, and is interred in the cemetery of the Sisters of the Cenacle, Lake Ronkonkoma, New York. Louise Boynton is buried alongside her.

==In popular culture==
The character of Elise McKenna in Richard Matheson&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Bid Time Return&quot; and its 1980 film adaptation, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (played by Jane Seymour), was based on Adams.

<text>The Woluwe (; ) is a stream that flows through several municipalities in the south-east and east of Brussels, Belgium, and is a right tributary of the Senne in Vilvoorde. The Kleine (little) Maalbeek is a tributary of the Woluwe in Kraainem. Many ponds formed along the stream over time, among which the Mellaerts Ponds still exist. The valley of the Woluwe crosses the municipalities of Auderghem, Watermael-Boitsfort, Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Kraainem, Zaventem, Machelen and Vilvoorde.

The towns of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe derive their name from it.

<doc id="540245" wikidata="Q728701" url="?curid=540245" title="Donald Audette">
<text>Donald Daniel Audette (born September 23, 1969) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward who played fourteen seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Buffalo Sabres, Los Angeles Kings, Atlanta Thrashers, Dallas Stars, Montreal Canadiens and Florida Panthers.

==Playing career==
He was selected in the ninth round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft (183rd overall) by the Buffalo Sabres. Prior to playing in the National Hockey League (NHL), Audette won the Dudley &quot;Red&quot; Garrett Memorial Award as the top rookie in the American Hockey League (AHL), while playing for the Rochester Americans.

Despite his small stature, Audette became known for his gritty, feisty style of play and quickly endeared himself to Buffalo hockey fans with a 31-goal rookie campaign. However, his approach to the game often led to lengthy trips to the injury reserve, including several knee injuries that cut short his 1990–91, 1992–93 and 1995–96 seasons respectively.

In 1998, Audette was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. Two years later, as a member of the Atlanta Thrashers, he reached his career high in goals (34) and assists (45) and was chosen as participant in that season&#x27;s NHL All-Star game.

Audette would be traded back to the Sabres in March 2001, and signed a multimillion-dollar contract with the Dallas Stars later that summer. In the midst of the 2001–02 season, Audette was again traded, this time to the Montreal Canadiens. In a game against the New York Rangers on December 1, 2001, Audette had the tendons of his forearm severed by an opponent&#x27;s skate and required life-saving surgery to repair the extensive damage, but still managed to recover in time for the playoffs.

After being placed on unconditional waivers by the Canadiens in January 2004, Audette signed with the Florida Panthers for the latter half of the 2003–04 season. Following this, he announced his retirement from professional play.

==Personal life==
Audette&#x27;s son Daniel (b. 1996) was the first pick of the 2012 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) Draft and was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.

Currently, Audette works an amateur scout with the Canadiens organization.

<text>Donald Methuen Fleming, (May 23, 1905 – December 31, 1986) was a Canadian parliamentarian, International Monetary Fund official and lawyer, born in Exeter, Ontario, Canada.

==Biography==
Fleming was born in Exeter, Ontario, in 1905. He was educated at the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School. He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1945 general election as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Toronto riding of Eglinton. In 1948, he was a candidate in that year&#x27;s Progressive Conservative leadership convention, losing to George Drew. He ran for the leadership again in the 1956 leadership convention, losing to John Diefenbaker.

The Speaker expelled Fleming from the House of Commons during the 1956 Pipeline Debate that helped lead to the defeat of the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent in the 1957 general election.

Diefenbaker became the new prime minister and appointed Fleming to the cabinet as Minister of Finance. As finance minister, Fleming clashed with the governor of the Bank of Canada, James Coyne, over monetary policy and ultimately demanded and got Coyne&#x27;s resignation in 1961. In 1962, Fleming became the Attorney General of Canada before retiring from politics in 1963.

Fleming returned to politics to seek the PC Party leadership at the 1967 leadership convention for a third time, but came in seventh, and left political life for good.

In later life, he was Governor of the World Bank, an International Monetary Fund official and Chairman of the Bank of Nova Scotia.

===Personal life===
Fleming married Alice Watson in 1933, and they had three children. He was a devout Christian, and was an elder of the Bloor Street United Church in Toronto. 

Fleming died in Toronto from a stroke on December 31, 1986, at the age of 81.

<doc id="540271" wikidata="Q1094394" url="?curid=540271" title="Colonies in antiquity">
<text>Colonies in antiquity were post-Iron Age city-states founded from a mother-city or metropolis rather than a territory-at-large. Bonds between a colony and its metropolis often remained close, and took specific forms during the period of classical antiquity. Generally, colonies founded by the ancient Phoenicians, Carthage, Rome, Alexander the Great and his successors remained tied to their metropolis, though Greek colonies of the Archaic and Classical eras were sovereign and self-governing from their inception. While Greek colonies were often founded to solve social unrest in the mother-city by expelling a part of the population, Hellenistic, Roman, Carthaginian, and Han Chinese colonies were used for trade, expansion and empire-building.
==Sabean Colonization of Africa==

One of the oldest colonisation process in history occurred around 1000 BC, the Sabeans of southern Arabia, with a civilization based on agriculture, began to colonize the highlands of northern Ethiopia and Eritrea. The indigenous peoples with whom the Sabaeans came into contact were the ancestors of the contemporary Agaw people. The fusion of southern Arabian culture and Agaw culture resulted in a third culture which are today known as the Habesha people.

==Egyptian colonies==
Egyptian settlement and colonisation is attested from about 3200 BC onward, all over the area of southern Canaan, by almost every type of artifact: architecture (fortifications, embankments and buildings), pottery, vessels, tools, weapons, seals, etc. Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt, from regions such as Arad, En Besor, Rafiah, and Tel Erani. Recently, a contemporary brewery belonging to a Bronze Age Egyptian settlement has been found in Tel Aviv. Shipbuilding was known to the ancient Egyptians as early as 3000 BC, and perhaps earlier. The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the earliest dated ship — dating to 3000 BC – may have possibly belonged to the Pharaoh Aha.

==Phoenician and Carthaginian colonies==

The Phoenicians were the major trading power in the Mediterranean in the early part of the first millennium BC. They had trading contacts in Egypt and Greece, and established colonies as far west as modern Spain, at Gadir (modern Cádiz), and modern Morocco, at Tingis and Mogador. From Spain and Morocco, the Phoenicians controlled access to the Atlantic Ocean and the trade routes to Britain and Senegal. 

The most famous and successful of Phoenician colonies was founded by settlers from Tyre in 814–813 BC and called Kart-Hadasht (&quot;Qart-ḥadašt&quot;, literally &quot;New Town&quot;), known in English as Carthage. The Carthaginians later founded their own colonies in the western Mediterranean, notably a colony in southeast Spain, Carthago Nova, which was eventually conquered by their enemy, Rome.

According to María Eugenia Aubet, Professor of Archaeology at the Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona: 
The earliest presence of Phoenician material in the West is documented within the precinct of the ancient city of Huelva, Spain... The high proportion of Phoenician pottery among the new material found in 1997 in the Plaza de las Monjas in Huelva argues in favour, not of a few first sporadic contacts in the zone, but of a regular presence of Phoenician people from the start of the ninth century BC. The recent radiocarbon dates from the earliest levels in Carthage situate the founding of this Tyrian colony in the years 835–800 cal BC, which coincides with the dates handed down by Flavius Josephus and Timeus for the founding of the city.
==Ancient Greek colonies==

In Ancient Greece, a defeated people would sometimes found a colony, leaving their homes to escape the subjugation of a foreign enemy. Sometimes colonies formed as a result of civil disorder, where the losers in internecine battles left to form a new city elsewhere; sometimes they would form to relieve population pressure and thereby to avoid internal unrest; and also, as a result of ostracism. In most cases, however, colony founders aimed to establish trade relations with foreign countries and to further the wealth of the metropolis. Colonies were established in Ionia and Thrace as early as the 8th century BC.

More than thirty Greek city-states had multiple colonies, dotted all across the Mediterranean world. From the late 9th to the 5th century BC, the most active colony-founding city, Miletus of the Ionian League, spawned more than 60 colonies encompassing the shores of the Black Sea in the east, the Iberian Peninsula in the west, Magna Graecia (southern Italy) and several colonies on the Libyan coast of northern Africa.

Greeks founded two similar types of colony, the &quot;&quot; (ἀποικία from ἀπό &quot;&quot; “away from” + οἶκος “home”, pl. ἀποικίαι &quot;apoikiai&quot;), an independent city-state, and the &quot;emporion&quot; (ἐμπόριov, pl. ἐμπόρια &quot;emporia&quot;), a trading colony.

Greek city-states began to establish colonies between 900 and 800 BC; the first two were Al Mina on the Syrian coast and the Greek emporium Pithecusae at Ischia in the Bay of Naples, both established about 800 BC by Euboeans.
Two new waves of colonists set out from Greece between the Dark Ages and the start of the Archaic Period – the first in the early 8th century BC and the second in the 6th century. Population growth and cramped conditions at home seem an insufficient explanation, while the economic and political dynamics produced by the competition between the frequently leaderless Greek city-states – newly introduced as a concept and striving to expand their spheres of economic influence – better fits as their true incentive. By means of this Greek expansion, the use of coins flourished throughout the Mediterranean Basin.

Influential Greek colonies in the western Mediterranean – many in present-day southern Italy — included Cyme; Rhegion by Chalcis and Zancle (c. 8th century); Syracuse by Corinth and Tenea (c. 734 BC); Naxos by Chalcis (c. 734 BC); Massalia (Marseille, c. 598 BC) and Agathe, shortly after Massalia, by Phocaea; Hyele in Italy and Emporion in Spain by Phocaea and Massalia (c. 540 BC and early 6th century); Antipolis in France by Achaea; Alalia in Corsica by Phocaea and Massalia (c. 545 BC) and Cyrene (Cyrenaica, Libya) by Thera (762/61 and 632/31 BC).

The Greeks also colonised the Crimea in the Black Sea. The settlements they established there included the city of Chersonesos (modern Sevastopol). Another area with significant Greek colonies was the coast of ancient Illyria on the Adriatic Sea (e.g. Aspalathos, modern Split, Croatia).

Cicero remarks on the extensive Greek colonization, noting that &quot;Indeed it seems as if the lands of the barbarians had been bordered round with a Greek sea-coast.&quot; Several formulae generally shaped the solemn and sacred occasions when a new colony set forth. If a Greek city decided to send out a colony, the citizenry almost invariably consulted an oracle, such as the Oracle of Delphi, beforehand. Sometimes certain classes of citizens were called upon to take part in the enterprises; sometimes one son was chosen by lot from every house where there were several sons; and strangers expressing a desire to join were admitted. A person of distinction was selected to guide the emigrants and to make the necessary arrangements. It was usual to honor these founders as heroes after their death. Some of the sacred fire was taken from the public hearth in the Prytaneum, from which the fire on the public hearth of the new city was kindled. Just as each individual had his private shrines, so the new community maintained the worship of its chief domestic deities, the colony sending embassies and votive gifts to the mother-city&#x27;s principal festivals for centuries afterwards.

After the conquests of Macedonia and Alexander the Great, a further number of Hellenistic colonies were founded, ranging from Egypt to India.

===Greek colonies in Anatolia===
By the 15th century BC, the Mycenaeans had reached Rhodes, Crete and Cyprus ( where Teucer is said to have founded the first colony) and the shores of Anatolia. In addition, Greeks were settled in Ionia and Pontus. Miletus in Ionia was an ancient Greek city on the west coast of Anatolia, near the mouth of the Meander River. In the late Bronze Age (13th century BC), Miletus saw the arrival of the Carians, Luwian speakers from south central Anatolia. Later in that century, other Greeks arrived. The city at that time rebelled against the Hittite Empire. After the fall of that empire, the city was destroyed in the 12th century BC and starting about 1000 BC was resettled extensively by Ionians. 

Before the invasion from Persia in the middle of the 6th century BC, Miletus was considered the greatest and wealthiest Greek polis. Over several centuries, numerous ancient Greek city-states were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks began Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia (Pre-Socratic philosophy). Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes and Diogenes of Apollonia were among the renowned philosophers of the Milesian school. Heraclitus lived in Ephesus another ancient Greek city and Anaxagoras was from Clazomenae, a member of the Ionian League. All the Ancient Greek dialects were spoken in Anatolia in the various city states and the list of ancient Greek theatres in Anatolia is one of the longest among all places the Greeks settled. 

Greeks traditionally lived in the region of Pontus, on the south shores of the Black Sea and in the Pontic Alps in northeastern Anatolia, the province of Kars in Caucasus, and also in Georgia. Those from southern Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea are often referred to as &#x27;Northern Pontic Greeks&#x27;, in contrast to those from &#x27;South Pontus&#x27;, which strictly speaking is Pontus proper. Those from Georgia, northeastern Anatolia, and the ones who lived in present-day Armenia are often referred to as &#x27;Eastern Pontic Greeks&#x27; or Caucasus Greeks. Many Greek-founded colonies are well known cities to this day. Sinope and Trabzon (Greek: Τραπεζοῦς &quot;Trapezous&quot;), were founded by Milesian traders (756 BC) as well as Samsun, Rize and Amasra. Greek was the lingua franca of Anatolia from the conquests of Alexander the Great up to the invasion of the Seljuk Turks in the eleventh century AD.

=== Jewish colonies ===
During the Ptolemaic rule of Judea, large-scale Jewish settlement in Egypt commenced. The Ptolemies brought in Jewish soldiers along with their families, while other Jews migrated from Judea to Egypt likely for economic opportunities. Additionally, the Ptolemies established Jewish colonies in the cities of Cyrenaica (modern-day Libya).

===Relations of colony and metropolis===

The relation between colony and mother-city (&quot;metropolis)&quot; was viewed as one of mutual affection. Differences were resolved peacefully whenever possible, war being seen as a last resort. (Note though that the Peloponnesian War of 431–404 BC broke out partly due to a dispute between Corinth and her colony Corcyra.) 

The charter of foundation contained general provisions for the arrangement of the affairs of the colony, and also some special enactments. A colony would usually adopt the constitution of the mother-city, but the new city remained politically independent. The &quot;holy fire&quot; of the &quot;metropolis&quot; was preserved in a special place to remind people of the common ties. If the colony sent out a fresh colony on its own account, the mother-city was generally consulted, or was at least asked to furnish a leader. Frequently the colonies, declaring their commitment to the various metropolitic alliances formed in the Greek mainland and for religious reasons, would pay tribute in religious centres such as Delphi, Olympia, or Delos.

The cleruchs (κληροῦχοι, &quot;klêrouchoi&quot;) formed a special class of Greek colonists, each being assigned an individual plot of land (κλῆρος, &quot;klêros&quot;). The trade factories set up in foreign countries, such as Naucratis in Egypt, were somewhat different from ordinary colonies, with the members retaining the right of domicile in their own homeland and confining themselves to their own quarter in the foreign city.

==Roman colonies==

It was an old custom in ancient Italy to send out colonies for the purpose of securing new conquests. The Romans, having no standing army, used to plant bodies of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison. These bodies would consist partly of Roman citizens, usually to the number of three hundred and partly of members of the Latin League in larger numbers. One third of the conquered territory was taken for the settlers. The &quot;coloniae civium Romanorum&quot; (colonies of Roman citizens) were specially intended to secure the two coasts of Italy, and were hence called &quot;coloniae maritimae&quot;. The far more numerous &quot;coloniae Latinae&quot; served the same purpose for the mainland, but they were also inhabited by Latins and much more populated.

The duty of leading the colonists and founding the settlement was entrusted to a commission usually consisting of three members. These men continued to stand in the relation of patrons (&quot;patroni&quot;) to the colony after its foundation. The colonists entered the conquered city in military array, preceded by banners, and the foundation was celebrated with special solemnities. The coloniae were free from taxes, and had their own constitution, a copy of the Roman, electing from their own body their Senate and other officers of State. To this constitution the original inhabitants had to submit. The &quot;coloniae civium Romanorum&quot; retained Roman citizenship, and were free from military service, their position as outposts being regarded as an equivalent. The members of the &quot;coloniae Latinae&quot; served among the &quot;socii&quot;, the allies, and possessed the so-called &quot;ius Latinum&quot; or Latinitas. This secured to them the right of acquiring property, the concept of &quot;commercium&quot;, and the right of settlement in Rome, and under certain conditions the power of becoming Roman citizens; though in course of time these rights underwent many limitations.

From the time of the Gracchi the colonies lost their military character. Colonization came to be regarded as a means of providing for the poorest class of the Roman Plebs. After the time of Sulla it was adopted as a way of granting land to veteran soldiers. The right of founding colonies passed into the hands of the Roman emperors during the Principate, who used it mainly in the provinces for the exclusive purpose of establishing military settlements, partly with the old idea of securing conquered territory. It was only in exceptional cases that the provincial colonies enjoyed the immunity from taxation which was granted to those in Italy.

==Chinese colonies==
Imperial China during the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) extended its rule over what is now much of China proper as well as Inner Mongolia, northern Vietnam, northern Korea, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, and the Tarim Basin region of Xinjiang on the easternmost fringes of Central Asia. After the nomadic Mongolic Xiongnu ruler Hunye (渾邪) was defeated by Huo Qubing in 121 BC, settlers from various regions of China under the rule of Emperor Wu of Han colonized the Hexi Corridor and Ordos Plateau. &quot;Tuntian&quot;, self-sustaining agricultural military garrisons, were established in frontier outposts to secure the massive territorial gains and Silk Road trade routes leading into Central Asia. Emperor Wu oversaw the Han conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC, bringing areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan Island, and northern Vietnam under Han rule, and by 108 BC completed the Han conquest of Gojoseon in what is now North Korea. Han Chinese colonists in the Xuantu and Lelang commanderies of northern Korea dealt with occasional raids by the Goguryeo and Buyeo kingdoms, but conducted largely peaceful trade relations with surrounding Korean peoples who in turn became heavily influenced by Chinese culture.

In 37 AD the Eastern Han general Ma Yuan sent Han Chinese to the northeastern frontier and settled defeated Qiang tribes within Han China&#x27;s Tianshui Commandery and Longxi Commandery. Ma pursued a similar policy in the south when he defeated the Trưng Sisters of Jiaozhi, in what is now modern northern Vietnam, resettling hundreds of Vietnamese into China&#x27;s Jing Province in 43 AD, seizing their sacred bronze drums as rival symbols of royal power, and reinstating Han authority and laws over Jiaozhi. Historian Rafe de Crespigny remarks that this was a &quot;brief but effective campaign of colonisation and control&quot;, before the general returned north in 44 AD.

Cao Song, an Eastern Han administrator of Dunhuang, had military colonies established in what is now Yiwu County near Hami in 119 AD. However, Empress Deng Sui, regent for the young Emperor Shang of Han, pursued a slow, cautious policy of settlement on the advice of Ban Yong, son of Ban Chao, as the Eastern Han Empire came into conflict with the Jushi Kingdom, the Shanshan and their Xiongnu allies located around the Taklamakan Desert in the Western Regions. In 127 AD Ban Yong was able to defeat the Karasahr in battle and colonies were established all the way to Turfan, but by the 150s AD the Han presence in the Western Regions began to wane. Towards the end of the Han dynasty, chancellor Cao Cao established agricultural military colonies for settling wartime refugees. Cao Cao also established military colonies in Anhui province in 209 AD as a means to clearly demarcate a border between his realm and that of his political rival Sun Quan.

<text>Rita Frances Dove (born August 28, 1952) is an American poet and essayist. From 1993 to 1995, she served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. She is the first African American to have been appointed since the position was created by an act of Congress in 1986 from the previous &quot;consultant in poetry&quot; position (1937–86). Dove also received an appointment as &quot;special consultant in poetry&quot; for the Library of Congress&#x27;s bicentennial year from 1999 to 2000. Dove is the second African American to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, in 1987, and she served as the Poet Laureate of Virginia from 2004 to 2006. Since 1989, she has been teaching at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she held the chair of Commonwealth Professor of English from 1993 to 2020; as of 2020, she holds the chair of Henry Hoyns Professor of Creative Writing.

==Early life==
Rita Dove was born in Akron, Ohio, to Ray Dove, one of the first African-American chemists to work in the U.S. tire industry (as a research chemist at Goodyear), and Elvira Hord, who achieved honors in high school and would share her passion for reading with her daughter. In 1970, Dove graduated from Buchtel High School as a Presidential Scholar. Later, Dove graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. from Miami University in 1973. From 1974 to 1975 she held a Fulbright Scholarship from University of Tübingen, Germany. She received her MFA from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1977.

==Career==
Dove taught creative writing at Arizona State University from 1981 to 1989. She received the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In May 1993 she was named United States Poet Laureate by the Librarian of Congress, an office she held until 1995. At the age of 40, Dove was the youngest person in the position and the first African American since the title was changed to Poet Laureate (Robert Hayden had served as the first non-white Consultant in Poetry from 1976 to 1978, and Gwendolyn Brooks had been the last Consultant in Poetry in 1985–86). Early in her tenure as poet laureate, Dove was featured by Bill Moyers in a one-hour interview on his PBS prime-time program &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;. Since 1989, she has been teaching at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she held the chair of Commonwealth Professor of English from 1993 to 2020 and is now the Henry Hoyns Professor of Creative Writing.

Dove also served as a Special Bicentennial Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1999/2000, along with Louise Glück and W. S. Merwin. In 2004, then-governor Mark Warner of Virginia appointed her to a two-year position as Poet Laureate of Virginia. In her public posts, Dove concentrated on spreading the word about poetry and increasing public awareness of the benefits of literature. As United States Poet Laureate, for example, she brought together writers to explore the African diaspora through the eyes of its artists.

Dove was on the board of the Associated Writing Programs (AWP) (now &quot;Association of Writers and Writing Programs&quot;) from 1985 to 1988, leading the organization as its president from 1986 to 1987. From 1994 to 2000, she was a senator (member of the governing board) of the national academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa. From 2006 to 2012 she served as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Since 1991, she has been on the jury of the annual Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards—from 1991 to 1996 together with Ashley Montagu and Henry Louis Gates; from 1997 to 2023 with Gates, Joyce Carol Oates, Simon Schama, Stephen Jay Gould (until his death in 2002) and Steven Pinker (who replaced Gould in 2002), and since 2023 with Pinker, Peter Ho Davies, Tiya Miles and Natasha Tretheway. Since 2023 she serves as vice president for literature at the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 2000 and 2001 Dove wrote a weekly column, &quot;Poet&#x27;s Choice&quot;, for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In the spring of 2018, Dove was named poetry editor of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. After writing nearly fifty columns in which she championed new American poetry, she resigned from the position in August 2019.

Dove&#x27;s work cannot be confined to a specific era or school in contemporary literature; her wide-ranging topics and the precise poetic language with which she captures complex emotions defy easy categorization. Her most famous work to date is &quot;Thomas and Beulah&quot;, published by Carnegie-Mellon University Press in 1986, a collection of poems loosely based on the lives of her maternal grandparents, for which she received the Pulitzer Prize in 1987. Dove has published eleven volumes of poetry, a book of short stories (&quot;Fifth Sunday&quot;, 1985), a collection of essays (&quot;The Poet&#x27;s World&quot;, 1995), and a novel, &quot;Through the Ivory Gate&quot; (1992). Her &quot;Collected Poems 1974–2004&quot; was released by W. W. Norton in 2016; it carries an excerpt from President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2011 National Medal of Arts commendation on its back cover.
In 1994, she published the play &quot;The Darker Face of the Earth&quot; (revised stage version 1996), which premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon, in 1996 (first European production: Royal National Theatre, London, 1999). She collaborated with composer John Williams on the song cycle &quot;Seven for Luck&quot; (first performance: Boston Symphony, Tanglewood, 1998, conducted by the composer). For &quot;America&#x27;s Millennium&quot;, the White House&#x27;s 1999/2000 New Year&#x27;s celebration, Dove contributed — in a live reading at the Lincoln Memorial, accompanied by John Williams&#x27; music — a poem to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Unfinished Journey&quot;. She also provided the texts for Pulitzer Prize winner Tania Leon&#x27;s musical works &quot;Singin&#x27; Sepia&quot; (1996), &quot;Reflections&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Crossing Choir&quot; (forthcoming), among other collaborations with multiple composers, most recently on &quot;A Standing Witness&quot; with Richard Danielpour.

Dove&#x27;s most ambitious collection of poetry to date, &quot;Sonata Mulattica&quot;, was published in 2009; it received the 2010 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award. Over its more than 200 pages, it &quot;has the sweep and vivid characters of a novel&quot;, as Mark Doty wrote in &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;.

Dove&#x27;s 11th collection of poetry, &quot;Playlist for the Apocalypse&quot;, was published by W. W. Norton in August 2021. &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Dwight Garner called it &quot;among her best&quot;, &quot;poems that are by turns delicate, witty and audacious.&quot;

Dove edited &quot;The Penguin Anthology of 20th-Century American Poetry&quot;, published in 2011. The collection provoked heated controversy as some critics complained that she valued an inclusive, populist agenda over quality. Poet John Olson commented that &quot;her exclusions are breathtaking&quot;. Well-known poets left out include Sylvia Plath, Allen Ginsberg, Sterling Allen Brown, Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff and Lorine Niedecker.

As Dove explained in her foreword and in media interviews, she had originally selected works by Plath, Ginsberg and Brown but these as well as some other poets were omitted against her editorial wishes; their contributions had to be removed from print-ready copy at the very last minute because their publisher forbade their inclusion due to a disagreement with Penguin over permission fees. Critic Helen Vendler condemned Dove&#x27;s choices, asking &quot;why are we being asked to sample so many poets of little or no lasting value?&quot; Dove defended her editorial work vigorously in her response to Vendler in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, as well as in wide-ranging interviews with &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, with poet Jericho Brown on the Best American Poetry website, and with Bill Moyers on his public television show &quot;Moyers &amp; Company&quot;. The &quot;Boston Review&quot; continued the discussion from different angles with an aggressive attack by scholar Marjorie Perloff and a spirited counter-attack by poet and scholar Evie Shockley, who took on both Vendler and Perloff.

Dove published a number of books in foreign translations, among them two into German, two into Chinese, three into Spanish, and one each into Norwegian, Macedonian, Italian, French, Dutch and Hebrew, plus numerous translations in foreign magazines. One of her earliest foreign translations was into French by Paol Keineg and published in the Breton review &quot;Bretagnes&quot; in 1976.

The annual &quot;Rita Dove Poetry Award&quot; was established by Salem College Center for Women Writers in 2004. The documentary film &quot;Rita Dove: An American Poet&quot; by Eduardo Montes-Bradley premiered at the Paramount Theater on January 31, 2014.

In 2019, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Walt Whitman&#x27;s birth, Dove put the African-American poetic reception of Whitman into perspective at a poetry festival in Bogotá, Colombia, during a round-table session with Robert Pinsky.

==Awards and honors==

Besides her Pulitzer Prize, Dove has received numerous literary and academic honors, among them 29 honorary doctorates – most recently, in 2018, from Harvard University, Smith College and The University of Michigan, and in 2022 from her graduate alma mater, The University of Iowa—as well as, in 2014, from Yale University and, in 2013, from Emerson College and Emory University). In 2016, she was the commencement speaker at The University of Virginia, which traditionally does not bestow honorary degrees. Among the other institutions of higher learning that granted her honorary doctorates are her undergraduate alma mater Miami University, Knox College, Tuskegee University, University of Miami (Florida), Washington University in St. Louis, Case Western Reserve University, The University of Akron, Arizona State University, Boston College, Dartmouth College, Spelman College, The University of Pennsylvania, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Notre Dame, Northeastern University, Columbia University, SUNY Brockport, Washington &amp; Lee University, Howard University, the Pratt Institute, Skidmore College and Duke University.

Dove received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1994, the National Humanities Medal / Charles Frankel Prize from President Bill Clinton in 1996, the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in the Arts and Humanities in 1997, and more recently, the 2006 Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service in Literature, the 2007 Chubb Fellowship at Yale University, the 2008 Library of Virginia Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2009 Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Medal, the 2009 Premio Capri and the 2011 National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama. In 2014, she was honored with the Carole Weinstein Prize in poetry and in 2015, as the first American, with the Poetry and People Prize in Guangdong, China. In 2016, she received the Stone Award for Lifetime Literary Achievement from Oregon State University. &quot;Collected Poems 1974–2004&quot;, released in 2016, was a finalist for the National Book Award, the winner of the NAACP Image Award in poetry and winner of the 2017 Library of Virginia Poetry Award. Also in 2017, she received the &quot;Callaloo&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award, followed in 2018 by &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; Award for Literary Achievement and in 2019 by the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets, the North Star Award (the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for lifetime achievement), the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal from Harvard University and the Langston Hughes Medal from City College of New York.

Since 2015, Rita Dove&#x27;s poem, Cozy Apologia, has been a part of the WJEC Edquas GCSE English Literature specification in England and Wales, featuring in its poetry anthology.

In 2021, Dove received the gold medal in poetry from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the academy&#x27;s highest honor, as the 16th poet (and only the 3rd female and 1st African-American) in the medals&#x27; 110-year history. The other fifteen poets who have received the medal since 1911 were James Whitcomb Riley, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, Marianne Moore, Conrad Aiken, William Carlos Williams, W. H. Auden, John Crowe Ransom, Archibald MacLeish, Robert Penn Warren, Richard Wilbur, John Ashbery, W. S. Merwin, Mark Strand and Louise Glück.

In 2022, an official portrait of Dove by photographer Sanjay Suchak, commissioned by the University of Virginia, was unveiled and is prominently displayed in the front room of the university&#x27;s historic Pavilion VII (Colonnade Club) on the West Lawn. Also in 2022, she won the Library of Virginia Poetry Award for &quot;Playlist for the Apocalypse&quot; and received two more lifetime achievement recognitions: a Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize from the Poetry Foundation and 
the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt Prize from the Library of Congress.

On Nov. 15, 2023, during the 74th National Book Awards ceremony in New York, Dove received the National Book Foundation&#x27;s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters as only the fourth poet in this lifetime achievement category, after Gwendolyn Brooks in 1994, Adrienne Rich in 2006 and John Ashbery in 2011. This was followed by an Academy of American Poets Leadership Award and the Thomas Robinson Prize for Southern Literature from Mercer University in 2024.

Dove is a member of the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, where she serves as vice president for literature during the 2023 to 2026 board term, the Fellowship of Southern Writers and PEN American Center. She was inducted into the Ohio Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1991, and in 2018 she was named one of the Library of Virginia&#x27;s Virginia Women in History.

==Personal life==
Dove married Fred Viebahn, a German-born writer, in 1979; they first met in the summer of 1976 when she was a graduate student in the Iowa Writers Workshop and he spent a semester as a Fulbright fellow in the University of Iowa&#x27;s International Writing Program. They lived in Oberlin, Ohio, from 1977 to 1979 while Viebahn taught in the Oberlin College German department, and spent extended periods of time in Germany, Ireland and Israel, before moving to Arizona in 1981. Their daughter, Aviva Dove-Viebahn, was born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1983. The couple are avid ballroom dancers, and have participated in a number of showcase performances. Since 1989 Dove and her husband have been living in Charlottesville, Virginia.

<text>Wilhelm Nero Pilate Barbellion was the pen name of Bruce Frederick Cummings (7 September 1889 – 22 October 1919), an English diarist who was responsible for &quot;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&quot;. Ronald Blythe called it &quot;among the most moving diaries ever created&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Cummings was born in Barnstaple 16 Cross Street on 7 September 1889, the youngest child of John and Maria Cummings. He was a naturalist at heart and ended up working at the British Museum&#x27;s Department of Natural History in London. Having begun his journal at the age of thirteen, Cummings continued to record his observations there – gradually moving from dry scientific notes to a more personal, literary style. Despite an obvious passion for the subject from an early age, Cummings, upon the advice of others, followed his father and Brother (Arthur John) into the world of journalism, which he hated, as he often mentioned in his diary. His literary ambitions changed course in 1914 upon reading the journal of the Russian painter Marie Bashkirtseff, in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. In his 15 January 1915 entry he indicated that he intended his Journal to be published: &quot;Then all in God’s good time I intend getting a volume ready for publication.&quot;

== Army rejection ==

Cummings&#x27; life changed forever when he was called to enlist in the British Army to fight in World War I in November 1915. He had consulted his doctor before taking the regulation medical prior to enlisting, and his doctor had given him a sealed, confidential letter to present to the medical officer at the recruitment center. Cummings did not know what was contained in the letter, but in the event it was not needed; the medical officer rejected Cummings as unfit for active duty after the most cursory of medical examinations. Hurt, Cummings decided to open the letter on his way back home to see what had been inside, and was staggered to learn that his doctor had diagnosed him with multiple sclerosis, and that he almost certainly had less than five years to live.

The news changed Cummings profoundly, and his journal became much more intense and personal as a result. He had married Winifred Eleanor Benger (aka Eleanor Abbey after her second marriage to Edwin Abbey) shortly before discovering his illness in 1915, and had a daughter, Penelope, in October 1916, but was later moved to discover that his wife had been informed of his condition long before he himself knew his fate, and his efforts to spare the feelings of his family had been in vain since they had known his condition even before he had.

==Publication of the diaries and final years==
His diaries up to the winter of 1917, which he revised and corrected prior to publication, were eventually published in March 1919 under the title &quot;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&quot;. He chose the pseudonym &quot;W. N. P. Barbellion&quot; to protect the identities of his family and friends; he chose the forenames &quot;Wilhelm&quot;, &quot;Nero&quot; and &quot;Pilate&quot; as his examples of the most wretched men ever to have lived. The first edition bore a preface by H. G. Wells, which led some reviewers to believe the journal was a work of fiction by Wells himself; Wells publicly denied this but the true identity of &quot;Barbellion&quot; was not known by the public until after Cummings&#x27; death.

&quot;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&quot;, filled with frank and keen observation, unique philosophy and personal resignation, was described by its author as &quot;a study in the nude&quot;. The book received both adulatory and scathing reviews; Collins, having originally optioned the book, eventually rejected it because they feared the &quot;lack of morals&quot; shown by Barbellion would damage their reputation. An editor&#x27;s note at the very end of the book claims Barbellion died on 31 December 1917, but Cummings in fact lived for nearly two more years. He died on 22 October 1919 at home in Camden Cottage, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, having recently approved the proofs of a second short volume of memoirs, &quot;Enjoying Life and Other Literary Remains&quot;; a third brief volume of his very last entries, &quot;A Last Diary&quot;, appeared in 1920. His identity was made public through his obituaries in various newspapers, at which point his brother Henry R. Cummings gave a newspaper interview providing details of the life of &quot;Barbellion&quot;.

The strong early sales and the admiration received by &quot;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&quot; are largely forgotten by the wider reading public today, but the book has been frequently reprinted in paperback and is regarded as a classic of English literature. It has been likened to the best work of other writers, including Franz Kafka and James Joyce.

It is also much admired by many with multiple sclerosis as a frank and eloquent portrayal of their struggle. Numerous MS societies and charities have recommended or even published copies of the book to encourage greater understanding among those with and without MS alike (see link below).

Barbellion sums up his life in one of the last entries in &quot;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&quot;: &quot;I am only twenty-eight, but I have telescoped into those few years a tolerably long life: I have loved and married, and have a family; I have wept and enjoyed, struggled and overcome, and when the hour comes I shall be content to die.&quot;

<text>The Magic Door (also known as The Magic Door Television Theatre) was a Jewish educational television series, aimed at providing kiruv (outreach) to Jewish children in the Chicago metropolitan area but intended to appeal to all children in the 5-to-9-age group. The show was produced by the Chicago Board of Rabbis, and premiered January 1, 1962. The show ran weekly until January 1, 1982. It aired at 9:00 AM every Sunday on WBBM-TV.

There were two main theme songs for &quot;The Magic Door&quot;. The first, &quot;A Room Zoom Zoom&quot;, was based on the children&#x27;s song &quot;A Ram Sam Sam&quot;. The second, written by Charles Gerber, was set to a melody from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastorale&quot; Symphony No. 6: 

The main characters of the series included &quot;Tiny Tov&quot; (an actor reduced via special effects to appear as a kind of elf) and his cousin &quot;Tina Tova&quot;. Tiny lived in a house that was made out of an acorn; the entrance was the Magic Door. Before entering the Magic Door to reach the town of Torahville, Tiny would sing a tune with the lyrics, 

In addition to Tiny and Tina, there were puppet characters, including Bubbe Beaver, Icky Witch, Rabbi and Mrs. Moreh, Max the Mailbox, Rumplemyer Dragon, Bunny Rabbit, Buddy, Worthington Warlock, and many others.

In the early days of the series, Tiny Tov would travel back through time riding his Magic Feather. Later on the program evolved into presenting moral topics. There would be a &quot;Hebrew Word of the Day&quot; that related to whatever values were being taught. Each week, Tiny Tov would educate Jewish children on Jewish history, sharing stories from Torah and Jewish tradition. Every episode would include a brief Hebrew lesson, stepping through the Aleph-Bet (Hebrew alphabet).

The characters of Tiny Tov and his cousin Tina Tova were created by Irv Kaplan, who later moved to Israel and was instrumental in the creation of Israeli Educational Television. There were four Tiny Tov actors in all. At the show&#x27;s start, Irv Kaplan played the role. From 1970 to 1973, Tiny Tov was portrayed by Emmy-nominated actor Jerry (Jerome) Loeb. The second player was Charles Gerber, who also created the song lyrics. Rabbi Joe Black was the last Tiny Tov. Tina Tova was played by Fran (Uditsky) Moss. The first puppeteer was Helen Cirkle.

Another outreach children&#x27;s program of the same name was produced and aired by WMAL-TV (now WJLA) in Washington, D.C. from 1969 to 1976, though it has no connection other than the name.

In the 1980s, a follow-up series was produced, &quot;Beyond the Magic Door&quot;.

Actor Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer Simpson and other characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; television series) was a semi-regular performer on &quot;The Magic Door&quot; and its spinoff, &quot;Beyond the Magic Door&quot;, from 1981 until 1984.

==Beyond the Magic Door==
Beyond The Magic Door was a children&#x27;s television show on WBBM-TV in Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s. The show was a sequel of sorts to the earlier program &quot;The Magic Door Television Theatre&quot;.

The theme song began with the following lyrics:
Rusty Steiger acted as the main puppeteer. Ken Raabe acted as a puppeteer. One of his characters included J. P. Potter, a disembodied hand wielding a cigar. David C. Waite was an ensemble cast member. Dan Castellaneta briefly played the role of Detective Farblonget, which was taken over by John Szostek. In 1984 Beyond The Magic Door won an Emmy Award in the category: Series for Children&#x27;s Programming. Winning Station: WBBMTV, Mindy Soble, Producer; Allen Stecher, Producer.

This translates system calls for the foreign system into native system calls for the host system. With some libraries for the foreign system, this will often be sufficient to run foreign binaries on the host system. A hardware compatibility layer consists of tools that allow hardware emulation.

==Software==

Examples include:

* Wine, which runs some Microsoft Windows binaries on Unix-like systems using a program loader and the Windows API implemented in DLLs
* Windows&#x27;s application compatibility layers to attempt to run poorly written applications or those written for earlier versions of the platform.
* Lina, which runs some Linux binaries on Windows, Mac OS X and Unix-like systems with native look and feel.
* KernelEX, which runs some Windows 2000/XP programs on Windows 98/Me.
* Executor, which runs 68k-based &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS programs in Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
* Anbox, an Android compatibility layer for Linux.
* Hybris, library that translates Bionic into glibc calls.
* Darling, a translation layer that attempts to run Mac OS X and Darwin binaries on Linux.
* Windows Subsystem for Linux v1, which runs Linux binaries on Windows via a compatibility layer which translates Linux system calls into native windows system calls.
*Cygwin, a POSIX-compatible environment that runs natively on Windows.
* 2ine, a project to run OS/2 application on Linux
* Rosetta 2, Apple&#x27;s translation layer bundled with macOS Big Sur to allow x86-64 exclusive applications to run on ARM hardware.
* Prism is a Microsoft emulator for ARM-powered Windows devices that translates the underlying code of software built for traditional x86 and x64 binaries from Windows 11 24H2
* ACL allows Android apps to natively execute on Tizen, webOS, or MeeGoo phones.
* Alien Dalvik allows Android apps to run on MeeGo and Meamo. Alien Dalvik 2.0 was also revealed for iOS on an iPad, however unlike MeeGo and Meamo, this version ran from the cloud.
* touchHLE is a compatibility layer (referred to as a “high-level emulator”) for Windows and macOS made by Andrea &quot;hikari_no_yume&quot; (Sweden) in early 2023 to run legacy 32-bit iOS software. The compatibility layer was only able to run one software, Super Monkey Ball as of version 0.1.0. As of version 0.1.2, support for the Lite version of Super Monkey Ball, as well as Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D and &quot;Touch &amp; Go&quot; has been added. She says that fans will have to &quot;be patient&quot; for anything else to emulate. It uses code translation along with CPU emulation when necessary, and specifically stated that she does not want to be compatible with 64 bit software. Later a pull request to add support for Android was issued, which allowed Android devices to run Super Monkey Ball for iOS.
* ipasim is a compatibility layer for Windows that uses WinObjC to translate code from Objective C to native Windows code.
* aah (sic) is a program for macOS to run iOS apps on macOS 10.15 &quot;Catalina&quot; on x86 processors via translation of the programs via the Catalyst framework.
* brs-emu is a compatibility layer to run Roku software via BrightScript on other platforms: Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Compatibility layer in kernel:
* FreeBSD&#x27;s Linux compatibility layer, which enables binaries built specifically for Linux to run on FreeBSD the same way as the native FreeBSD API layer. FreeBSD also has some Unix-like system emulations, including NDIS, NetBSD, PECoff, SVR4, and different CPU versions of FreeBSD.
* NetBSD has several Unix-like system emulations.
* Columbia Cycada, an unreleased compatibility layer which runs Apple iOS applications on Android systems
* Windows Subsystem for Linux provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft.
* The PEACE Project (aka COMPAT_PECOFF) has Win32 compatible layer for NetBSD. The project is now inactive.
* On RSTS/E for the PDP-11 series of minicomputers, programs written to run on the RT-11 operating system could run (without recompiling) on RSTS through the RT-11 Run-Time System having its EMT flag set, meaning that an RT-11 EMT instruction that matches a RSTS EMT is diverted to the RT-11 Run-Time System which translates them to the equivalent RSTS EMT. Programs written to take advantage of RSTS directly (or calls to RSTS within the Run-Time system itself) signal this by having a &quot;second&quot; EMT instruction (usually EMT 255) immediately before the actual RSTS EMT code.
A compatibility layer avoids both the complexity and the speed penalty of full hardware emulation. Some programs may even run faster than the original, &quot;e.g.&quot; some Linux applications running on FreeBSD&#x27;s Linux compatibility layer may perform better than the same applications on Red Hat Linux. Benchmarks are occasionally run on Wine to compare it to Windows NT-based operating systems.

Even on similar systems, the details of implementing a compatibility layer can be quite intricate and troublesome; a good example is the IRIX binary compatibility layer in the MIPS architecture version of NetBSD.

A compatibility layer requires the host system&#x27;s CPU to be (upwardly) compatible to that of the foreign system. For example, a Microsoft Windows compatibility layer is not possible on PowerPC hardware because Windows requires an x86 CPU. In this case full emulation is needed.

==Hardware==
Hardware compatibility layers involve tools that allow hardware emulation. Some hardware compatibility layers involve breakout boxes because breakout boxes can provide compatibility for certain computer buses that are otherwise incompatible with the machine.

<text>Christian Rune Bäckman (born 28 April 1980) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played over 300 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers and Columbus Blue Jackets, and spent the latter part of his career with Frölunda HC of the Swedish Hockey League.

==Playing career==
Bäckman was drafted by St. Louis Blues in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, 1st round, 24th overall. It was not until the 2002–03 NHL season that he got a contract for play in the NHL. He only played four games for St. Louis in his first season, spending the rest of the season playing for Worcester Ice Cats in the American Hockey League (AHL). Between 2003–04 and 2007–08 he was a regular for St. Louis recording 64 points (19 goals, 45 assists), and 130 penalty minutes in 228 games.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout Bäckman played for his Swedish youth club Frölunda in Elitserien where he totalled 19 points in 50 games, winning the Elitserien playoffs.

St. Louis announced on 10 August 2006 that the club re-signed Bäckman for a multi-year contract, although no contract details were released. According to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet the contract gave Bäckman 50 million Swedish kronor (approx. $7 million) over three years.

On 26 February 2008, Bäckman was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for a 4th round draft pick. On 2 March 2008, in his second game as a Ranger, Bäckman scored his first goal as a Ranger on Antero Niittymäki of the Philadelphia Flyers, off assists from Brendan Shanahan and Scott Gomez.

On 2 July 2008, Bäckman was traded, along with Fedor Tyutin, to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Nikolai Zherdev and Dan Fritsche. In October 2009, Bäckman signalled the conclusion of his North American career by signing with Frölunda HC.

==Personal life==
Bäckman was born 1980 in a small town Alingsås. He has two siblings. He grew up in mostly Alingsås but moved to Gothenburg to start his Ice Hockey career.

Bäckman is married to wife Jeanette Bäckman. Together they have 3 children. William Bäckman born in 2001, Thea Bäckman born in 2004 and Ellie Bäckman born in 2010. He spends his off-season in Gothenburg, Sweden.

<doc id="540295" wikidata="Q667801" url="?curid=540295" title="Escape pod">
<text>An escape pod, escape capsule, life capsule, or lifepod is a capsule or craft, usually only big enough for one person, used to escape from a vessel in an emergency. An escape ship is a larger, more complete craft also used for the same purpose. Escape pods are ubiquitous in science fiction but are only used in a few real vehicles.

==Real life==
* Because they were intended to fly too high and fast for safe use of conventional ejection seats, the Bell X-2, B-58 Hustler, XB-70 Valkyrie, F-111 and B‑1A Lancer all used enclosed escape crew capsules of some kind.
** A similar concept OSCAR (Optimum Survival Containment and Recovery), was intended for the Vought F-8 Crusader.
* The single submarine of the Soviet &quot;Mike&quot;-class, K-278 Komsomolets had an escape capsule, which was jettisoned upon its sinking in 1989. Other Soviet submarines like the Oscar-class are only rumored to have escape capsules. During the sinking of the &quot;Kursk&quot;, the crew was unable to reach it. Also the Typhoon-class is rumored to have escape pods located near or in the sail. Evidence for this can be found in a German documentary on the &quot;Typhoon&quot;-class submarine &quot;Severstal&quot;. The Shishumar class submarine has an IKL-designed integrated escape sphere. The sphere has accommodations for the entire crew with an eight-hour air supply.

==Fiction==
Escape pods are frequently depicted as being used by large spacecraft in science fiction, for example the Millennium Falcon in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the Axiom in &quot;WALL-E&quot;, and the vessels of Starfleet in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The 1981 film &quot;Lifepod&quot; and the 1993 TV film of the same name both revolve around such vehicles.

<text>A rim-fire (or rimfire) is a type of metallic cartridge used in firearms where the primer is located within a hollow circumferential rim protruding from the base of its casing. When fired, the gun&#x27;s firing pin will strike and crush the rim against the edge of the barrel breech, sparking the primer compound within the rim, and in turn ignite the propellant within the case. Invented in 1845 by Louis-Nicolas Flobert, the first rimfire metallic cartridge was the (also known as the 6mm Flobert) cartridge, which consisted of a percussion cap with a bullet attached to the top. While many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the early 19th century, such as teat-fire and pinfire, only small caliber rimfire (.22caliber (5.6mm) or less) cartridges have survived to the present day with regular use. The .22Long Rifle rimfire cartridge, introduced in 1887, is by far the most common ammunition found in the world today in terms of units manufactured and sold.

==Characteristics==
It is named rimfire ammunition as the firing pin strikes and crushes the base&#x27;s rim to ignite the primer. The rim of such a cartridge is essentially an expanded and flattened end section of the case, and the priming compound is filled from inside into the trough cavity inside the rim. The case is then filled with propellant (gunpowder) and sealed off by the projectile (bullet). 

Rimfire cartridges are limited to low chamber pressures because the case must be thin enough to allow the firing pin to crush the rim and ignite the primer. Rimfire cartridges of up to .58 caliber were once common when black powder was used as a propellant. Modern rimfire cartridges use smokeless powder, which generates much higher pressures and tend to be of .22 caliber (5.5 mm) or smaller. This also means that rimfire firearms can be very light and inexpensive, as the production cost of the case material and powder load are both low, and the manufacturing process is significantly more streamlined than that for centerfire cartridges (which require more steps in the assembly process). As a result, rimfire cartridges are typically very affordable, primarily because of the inherent cost-efficiency of manufacturing in large lots, which has contributed to the continuing market popularity of these small-caliber cartridges.

==History==

Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Flobert invented the first rimfire metallic cartridge in 1845. The 6mm Flobert cartridge consisted of a percussion cap with a bullet attached to the top. These cartridges do not contain any powder, the only propellant substance contained in the cartridge is the percussion cap. In Europe, the .22 BB Cap (introduced in 1845) and the slightly more powerful .22 CB Cap (introduced in 1888) are both called 6mm Flobert and are considered the same cartridge. These cartridges have a relatively low muzzle velocity of around to .

Flobert also made what he called &quot;parlor guns&quot; for this cartridge, as these rifles and pistols were designed for target shooting in homes with a dedicated shooting parlor or shooting gallery. 6mm Flobert Parlor pistols came into fashion in the mid-19th century; they typically featured heavy barrels. This cartridge was improved upon by Benjamin Houllier in 1846.

The next rimfire cartridge was the .22 Short, developed for Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s first revolver, in 1857; it used a longer rimfire case and of black powder to fire a conical bullet. According to Berkeley R. Lewis, a firearms historian, this later Smith &amp; Wesson cartridge was &#x27;essentially the same as Houllier&#x27;s 1846 patent&#x27;. This led to the .22 Long in 1871, with the same bullet weight as the short but with a longer case and of black powder. This was followed by the .22 Extra Long in 1880, with a longer case and heavier bullet than the .22 Long.

American firearms manufacturer J. Stevens Arms &amp; Tool Company introduced the .22 Long Rifle cartridge in 1887. It combined the casing of the .22 Long with the bullet of the .22 Extra Long, giving it a longer overall length, a higher muzzle velocity, and superior performance as a hunting and target round, rendering the .22 Short, .22 Long, and .22 Extra Long cartridges obsolete. The .22 LR uses a heeled bullet, which means that the bullet is the same diameter as the case, which has a narrower &quot;heel&quot; portion that fits into the case. It is one of the few cartridges that are manufactured and used in a large variety of rifles and handguns.

Larger rimfire calibers were used during the American Civil War in the Henry repeating rifle, the Spencer repeating rifle, the Ballard Rifle, and the Frank Wesson carbine. While rimfire cartridges larger than .22 caliber existed, such as the .30 rimfire, .32 rimfire, .38 rimfire, .41 Short (for the Remington Model 95 derringer), .44 Henry (for the Henry rifle, later used by the famous Winchester Model 1866), the .56-56 Spencer (for the Spencer rifle was the world&#x27;s first military metallic cartridge repeating rifle), all the way up to the .58 Miller, they were quickly made obsolete by the newly developed centerfire cartridges.

The early 21st century has seen a revival in .17 caliber (4.5 mm) rimfire cartridges. New and increasingly popular, the 17 HMR is based on a .22 WMR casing with a smaller formed neck which accepts a .17 bullet. The advantages of the 17 HMR over .22 WMR and other rimfire cartridges are its much flatter trajectory and its highly frangible hollow point bullets (often manufactured with plastic &quot;ballistic tips&quot; that improve the bullet&#x27;s external ballistics). The .17 HM2 (Hornady Mach 2) is based on the .22 Long Rifle and offers similar performance advantages over its parent cartridge, at a significantly higher cost. While .17 HM2 sells for about four times the cost of .22 Long Rifle ammunition, it is still significantly cheaper than most centerfire ammunition and somewhat cheaper than the .17 HMR. First shown at the 2013 SHOT Show, the .17 WSM uses the blank case from a .27 caliber nail gun that is necked down to accommodate a .17 caliber bullet, resulting in a much higher muzzle velocity and energy than the .17 HMR.

==Shot shells==
Some .22 caliber rimfire cartridges are loaded with a small amount of No. 11 or No. 12 shot (about ). This &quot;snake shot&quot; is only marginally effective in close ranges, and is usually used for shooting snakes, rats or other small animals. It is also useful for shooting birds inside storage buildings as it will not penetrate walls or ceilings. At a distance of about , which is about the maximum effective range, the pattern is about in diameter from a standard rifle. Special smoothbore shotguns, such as the &quot;Marlin Model 25MG &quot;Garden Gun&quot;&quot; can produce effective patterns out to using .22 WMR shotshells, which hold of No. 11 or No. 12 shot contained in a plastic capsule.

Shotshells will not feed reliably in some magazine-fed firearms, because of the unusual shape of some cartridges that are crimped closed at the case mouth, and the relatively fragile plastic tips of other designs. Shotshells will not produce sufficient power to cycle semiautomatic actions, because, unlike projectile ammunition, nothing forms to the lands and grooves of the barrel to create the pressure necessary to cycle the firearm&#x27;s action.

The 9 mm Flobert is a notable rimfire cartridge that is still in production in Europe and is chambered by the Winchester Model 36 in the 1920s. This cartridge is primarily loaded with a small amount of shot, but can also fire a small ball, and is used in &quot;garden gun&quot;, which are miniature shotguns. Its power and range are very limited, making it suitable only for pest control. An example of a rare but modern 9 mm Flobert Rimfire among hunters in Europe is the brass shotshell manufactured by Fiocchi in Lecco, Italy, using a shot of No. 8 shot with a velocity of .

<text>Kings (also known as king&#x27;s cup, donut, circle of death or ring of fire) is a drinking game using playing cards. Players must drink and dispense drinks based on cards drawn. The cards have predetermined drink rules prior to the game&#x27;s beginning. Often groups establish house rules with their own game variations.

==Equipment==
*A deck of playing cards
*Alcoholic beverages (typically wine, beer, or mixed drinks) or non alcoholic beverages
*A large cup which will be used as the King&#x27;s Cup, or (in the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; version of the game) an unopened beer can

==Setup and common rules==

In this game, a deck of cards is shuffled and dealt into a circle around either an empty cup or a full drink of choice. Each card value is assigned an action, which is then performed by the relevant players upon it being drawn. Players then take turns drawing cards and participating in the activity assigned by the card dealt.

This game is open-ended and all of the cards can signify any mini-game, the rules and the card assignments are normally confirmed at the beginning of the game. Depending on house rules, the game either ends when the last rule card has been pulled or the king&#x27;s cup has been consumed. In variations where cards are placed on top of the king&#x27;s cup, the game is over when the cards fall off, with the player responsible for knocking them off having to consume the king&#x27;s cup.

Players also often make up and agree on a set of rules every time the game is played. Some common assignments for card values include:

==Ring of Fire==

In the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; version of the game, a can of beer (or other alcoholic beverage) is placed in the center of the ring of cards. Players &quot;discard&quot; cards by sliding them under the beer tab. The player who pops the beer tab must drink the whole can. That signals the end of the round, and another can is placed in the middle to continue the game.

If by drawing a card a player creates a gap in the circle of cards, they must finish their own drink.

==Variations and other rules==

Like most other drinking games, Kings has endless variations of rules, and individual drinking groups usually have their own set of card effects. There will be similar rules, but there will most likely always be some that some players have never encountered before. Some games specify that playing a certain card allows that player to make up a new rule which lasts for the remainder of the game.

A major variation in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or Canada is that the contents of the King&#x27;s Cup are drunk by the player who breaks the circle of cards (known as the Ring of Fire in the UK).

A popular variation in Australia is the Smoko or Toilet Card replacing Give Two Take Two. In this version, a player needs to possess a Smoko Card to leave the table to smoke or to use the toilet. A player can have multiple copies of the card and they can be traded, typically under conditions such as; the recipient must refill drinks on demand, crawl for the rest of the game, talk in a funny voice, etc.

When drinking from bottles of beer, the discard can be placed on top of the beer with two corners of each card hanging off the edge. As this continues, it will begin to resemble a mushroom. Similar to the game Jenga, if the mushroom collapses, the person who last placed their card or was attempting to do so must drink the entire bottle. If all cards are successfully discarded without the mushroom collapsing, the last person to discard drinks the bottle, and others finish their drinks.

In Belgium the game is known as &quot;Circle of Destruction&quot; or &quot;Hardcore Kings&quot;. In the beginning a pint is placed in the middle of the circle and everyone has to pour some of their drink in it, from now on this drink is referred to as &quot;Witch&#x27;s Brew&quot;.

<text>Trevor John Linden (born April 11, 1970) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former president of hockey operations and alternate governor of the Vancouver Canucks. He spent 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), playing centre and right wing with four teams: the Vancouver Canucks (in two tenures; the first and last), New York Islanders, Montreal Canadiens and Washington Capitals. Before joining the NHL in 1988, Linden helped the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) win consecutive Memorial Cup championships. In addition to appearing in two NHL All-Star Games, Linden was a member of the 1998 Canadian Olympic team and participated in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey.

Throughout his career, Linden was recognized as a respected leader on and off the ice. He was named captain of the Canucks at age 21, making him one of the youngest captains in league history. In that capacity, Linden was nicknamed &quot;Captain Canuck&quot; and led the team to back-to-back Smythe Division titles in 1992 and 1993, followed by a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1994, where they lost in seven games. In 1998, he was elected president of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), a position he held for eight years. As President, he played an instrumental role in the 2004–05 NHL lockout, including negotiations with league owners. Off the ice, Linden has taken an active role in charities, and was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for leadership on the ice and humanitarian contributions off the ice in 1997, as well as the NHL Foundation Player Award in 2008. Linden retired on June 11, 2008, 20 years to the day after he was drafted into the NHL. Linden&#x27;s jersey number 16 was retired by the Canucks on December 17, 2008, the second number retired by the team.

On April 9, 2014, Linden was named president of hockey operations for the Vancouver Canucks, a position he held until July 2018.
== Early life ==
Trevor Linden&#x27;s grandfather, Nick van der Linden, emigrated to Canada from the Netherlands in 1929. He ran a construction company until his son Lane (Trevor&#x27;s father) replaced him in 1979. Trevor was born on April 11, 1970, in Medicine Hat, Alberta to Lane and Edna Linden. Linden was a skilled athlete; while hockey was his top priority, he also participated in baseball, golf, volleyball, basketball and speed skating. An excellent student in school, he was recruited by Princeton University to play for their hockey team. Instead, Linden chose to stay in Medicine Hat and play with the local major junior team, the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Linden grew up watching the Tigers and idolized Lanny McDonald, who played in Medicine Hat before he joined the NHL.

After one season playing with the Medicine Hat Midget Tigers of the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL), Linden joined the WHL Tigers for the final five games of the 1985–86 regular season, where he scored two goals; he also appeared in six playoff games, scoring one goal. The next season, at age 16, he made the team full-time. In his first full season in the WHL, Linden had 36 points in 72 games, and then had 9 points in 20 playoff games, including two goals in the championship game, helping Medicine Hat win their first Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions. The next year, Linden had 110 points in 67 games and led the Tigers to their second consecutive Memorial Cup title. During the 1988 WHL playoffs, Linden set a WHL playoff record by scoring the fastest goal from the start of a game, seven seconds into a 6–5 Tigers win over the Saskatoon Blades on April 15, 1988. At the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, the Vancouver Canucks selected Linden second overall, after the Minnesota North Stars selected Mike Modano.

== NHL career ==

=== Vancouver Canucks (1988–1998) ===
Linden made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the Winnipeg Jets, aged 18. He scored his first goal on October 18, 1988, against Kelly Hrudey of the New York Islanders and later, on November 17, he scored his first hat-trick against the Minnesota North Stars. Linden finished the season tied for the team lead in goals (30) and second for points (59). He was the first Canucks rookie to score 30 goals and came within one point of tying Ivan Hlinka&#x27;s team record of 60 points as a first-year player, set in 1981–82 (the record was later tied by Pavel Bure in 1991–92). Linden also became the first rookie to win the Cyclone Taylor Award, given to the Canucks&#x27; most valuable player. He was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team, and finished second to Brian Leetch, of the New York Rangers, in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the rookie of the year. Fans voted him as the winner of &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; rookie of the year award. The Canucks made the playoffs in the 1988–89 season, for the first time in three years, and Linden scored seven points in the Canucks&#x27; seven-game series loss to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames.

In his sophomore NHL season, Linden finished second on the team in goals (21) and points (51) and finished third in assists (30). The following year, he was one of three Canucks to share a rotating captaincy, the others being Doug Lidster and Dan Quinn. Linden led the team with 37 assists and 70 points, and made his first appearance in an NHL All-Star Game, where he was the youngest player. At age 21, he was made sole captain of the team, becoming the youngest Canucks captain. That season, Linden led the Canucks in scoring for a second straight year with 75 points (31 goals and 44 assists), leading the Canucks to their first division title since the 1974–75 season.

A natural winger early in his career, Linden began learning to play at the centre position during the Canucks training camp in October 1992. Canucks head coach Pat Quinn initiated the switch in response to the losses of centres Anatoli Semenov and Petr Nedvěd during the off-season. The Canucks repeated as Smythe Division champions that year, setting franchise records for wins and points with 46 and 101 respectively. For the third-straight season, Linden surpassed 30 goals and 70 points, finishing with 33 goals and 72 points.

In the 1993–94 season, Linden scored 32 goals, the fifth time in six seasons he had scored at least 30, but his points total fell to 61 as the Canucks finished 12 points behind the division leader. Although they were the seventh seed in the playoffs, the Canucks reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 12 years and second time in team history. Considered the underdogs against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning New York Rangers captained by Mark Messier, the Canucks initially fell behind three games to one but pushed the series to seven games. In Game 7, Linden scored twice (the next player to get two goals in a game seven was Alex Tanguay in 2001), but the Canucks lost 3–2. Linden finished second on the team in playoff scoring, with 12 goals and 25 points. It was revealed afterwards that Linden had played through the finals with broken ribs and torn rib cartilage.

In the 1995–96 season, Linden had 33 goals, 47 assists and 80 points, the most he has ever collected in all three statistical categories. On February 27, 1996, he played in his 437th consecutive game, breaking the team record previously held by Don Lever. The following season marked the end of Linden&#x27;s ironman streak; between October 4, 1990, and December 3, 1996, he appeared in 482 consecutive games, the longest in the league at the time. His team record was later broken in 2007 by Brendan Morrison. In his 49 games that season, he scored 9 goals and 31 assists. At the conclusion of the season, the NHL recognized Linden&#x27;s contributions to the Vancouver community and awarded him the King Clancy Memorial Trophy.

At the start of the 1997–98 season, the Canucks added free agent Mark Messier, a six-time Stanley Cup winner, and manager/head coach Mike Keenan, who were, respectively, captain and head coach of the New York Rangers when they defeated Vancouver in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. Keenan&#x27;s hiring was as a result of Pat Quinn being dismissed as general manager, and Keenan also assumed the title of bench boss by firing head coach Tom Renney early in the season. According to some accounts, Linden initially gave up the team captaincy to Messier out of respect, but later regretted the move as he felt Messier&#x27;s invasion of the dressing room was hostile. Friction developed between Linden and Keenan early in the season. As the relationship worsened, Keenan claimed that it was evident Linden would be traded. After a 5–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues, Keenan openly blamed Linden for the loss, a moment Linden refers to as his &quot;darkest time&quot;. Playing in 42 games with the Canucks before the February Olympic break, Linden had 7 goals and 21 points.

=== New York, Montreal and Washington (1998–2001) ===
Linden was traded to the New York Islanders on February 6, 1998, in exchange for Todd Bertuzzi, Bryan McCabe and the Islanders&#x27; third-round pick (used to select Jarkko Ruutu) in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. After the conclusion of the Olympics, in which he participated, Linden joined the Islanders and played 25 games with the team. He scored 10 goals and 7 assists for 17 points to finish the season, with a combined 17 goals and 21 assists for 38 points in 67 games. The following year, his first full season in three years, Linden was second on the team with 47 points, and third with 18 goals. However, on May 29, 1999, the Islanders traded Linden to the Montreal Canadiens for a first-round draft pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft (used to select Branislav Mezei), mostly for financial reasons. The thrill of playing in Montreal, the &quot;centre of hockey&quot;, was an exciting prospect to Linden after his time spent with the Islanders, where the arena was usually half-filled when he played there.

With Montreal, Linden was often injured and only appeared in 50 games during his first season, scoring 30 points. The next year, he appeared in 57 games, scoring 33 points. While with the Canadiens, he signed a four-year contract worth $15 million. However, he was traded for the third time in his career, this time to the Washington Capitals, going with Dainius Zubrus, and the New Jersey Devils&#x27; second-round draft pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft (later traded to Tampa Bay, who selected Andreas Holmqvist) in exchange for Richard Zedník, Jan Bulis and Washington&#x27;s first-round pick in the 2001 Draft (used to select Alexander Perezhogin). With Washington, Linden reached the playoffs for the first time in four years, in the 2000–01 season.

=== Return to Vancouver (2001–2008) ===
After 28 games over two seasons with the Capitals, Linden had scored only four goals and three assists. On November 10, 2001, the Capitals traded Linden, along with a second-round draft pick in either 2002 or 2003 (used to select Denis Grot), to the Canucks in exchange for their first round pick in 2002 (used to select Boyd Gordon) and a third-round pick in 2003 (later traded to the Edmonton Oilers, who selected Zack Stortini). Linden scored 34 points with Vancouver in 64 games, which included his 1,000th regular season game on March 26, 2002, against the Los Angeles Kings. In his first playoff series with Vancouver in six years, he scored a goal and four assists in six games.

The 2002–03 season was Linden&#x27;s first full season with the Canucks since 1996–97, though Linden sprained his knee in the season opener and had to miss two weeks. He returned in time to be honoured for his 1,000th career game, which he achieved the season before. As he did not want to distract the team from the playoff race, Linden asked for the ceremony to be delayed. On November 25, 2002, against the Minnesota Wild, Linden scored his 263rd goal with the Canucks, breaking former captain Stan Smyl&#x27;s team record for most goals. He finished the year with 19 goals and 22 assists for 41 points, his highest goal total in seven seasons, and his highest points total since 1998–99.

The following season, Linden broke several more Canucks records. In a February 16, 2004, game against the Colorado Avalanche, he played in his 897th game as a Canuck, passing Smyl. On March 8, once again playing the Avalanche, Linden had two points, including his team-record 674th point with the Canucks, a mark also previously held by Smyl. For the first time in five years, he played in all 82 games, recording 36 points. After a year-long break from hockey during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, in which he actively participated in new collective agreement negotiations on behalf of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), Linden again appeared in all 82 games during the 2005–06 season, scoring 7 goals and 16 points. Linden became the first player to play 1,000 games with the Canucks on April 13, 2006, when they faced the San Jose Sharks.

In the 2006–07 season opener, on October 5, 2006, Linden scored the game winner against the Detroit Red Wings to become the first Canuck to score 300 goals with the team. After notching 25 points in 80 games, he helped the Canucks reach the second round of the playoffs. He scored two game-winning goals in the first round, including the series-winning goal against the Dallas Stars in Game 7 of their first-round matchup, which was Linden&#x27;s sixth Game 7 goal of his playoff career. He finished the playoffs with a team-leading 7 points in 12 games. This made Linden the Canucks&#x27; all-time leader in playoff goals (34), assists (61) and points (95).

After taking the summer to decide if he would return for another season, Linden signed a one-year contract with the Canucks in August 2007. The season was not ideal for Linden, who was a healthy scratch 23 times. In the 59 games he played, he scored seven goals and five assists, by far the lowest totals in his career. Against the Calgary Flames on November 8, 2007, he earned his 412th assist with the Canucks, surpassing Smyl once again. He finished his career with 415 assists as a Canuck, which stood as the all-time mark until Henrik Sedin surpassed him on March 14, 2010. Linden played in the final game of his NHL career on April 5, 2008, against Calgary. Despite Vancouver losing 7–1, Linden was named the game&#x27;s first star and skated a lap around GM Place to a standing ovation and received handshakes from the Calgary players.

On June 11, 2008, after 19 seasons in the NHL and 20 years to the day of being drafted into the NHL by the Canucks, Linden announced his retirement, leaving as the franchise leader in games played with the Canucks (1140) and assists (415, since surpassed by Henrik Sedin), and second in goals to later captain Markus Näslund. Shortly after, Vancouver City Council stated it would honour Linden by declaring the date of his jersey retirement to be Trevor Linden Day in Vancouver.

The Canucks retired Linden&#x27;s jersey number, 16, from circulation in a pre-game ceremony December 17, 2008, prior to playing the Edmonton Oilers. Linden became the second Canuck to have his jersey retired, joining former captain Stan Smyl, whose jersey number, 12, was retired in 1991. Earlier in the day, the Canucks changed the number of the entrance gate for players and VIPs from Gate 5 to Gate 16 in honour of Linden.

== Off the ice ==

=== Personal life===
In 1995, Linden married Cristina Giusti, the owner of Basquiat, a Vancouver boutique. In 2017, the Lindens had their first child, son Roman Matthias Linden, named after Cristina&#x27;s father Romano and Linden&#x27;s Canuck teammate Mattias Ohlund. In 2004, Linden was baptized as a Roman Catholic. Linden&#x27;s younger brother, Jamie Linden, also played ice hockey. After a lengthy junior career in the WHL, Jamie played four games with the Florida Panthers in the 1994–95 season before finishing his hockey career in the minor leagues. Together with Trevor, Jamie is now a property developer, something they developed an interest in while growing up in Medicine Hat. Trevor had indicated that after his playing career was finished, he would like to become more involved in real estate. Linden is also an avid and competitive cyclist, frequenting the local Squamish and Whistler area to mountain bike, in addition to participating in various races. Most significantly, in the summer of 2007, Linden competed in the Trans Alp bike race, a 600 km race across the European Alps. Linden and racing teammate John Ramsden finished 48th out of the 122 competing two-man teams over the eight-day competition.
Linden was involved in the creation and recent launch of Club 16 – Trevor Linden Fitness. Linden has also partnered with Vancouver developer Howard Airey, principal of Airey Development Group, to build two residential/commercial development projects. He was also the spokesperson for ClearlyContacts.ca.

=== NHLPA president ===
As a player representative to the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience as a chance to be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected president of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new collective agreement that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.

=== Attachment to Vancouver ===
Linden&#x27;s long tenure with the Canucks (Linden holds third most games played in franchise history at 1,140), deep attachment to the city of Vancouver and history of charitable community service and involvement have made him one of the most beloved and respected players among fans in franchise history. His 2001 return to the Canucks was an emotional event for fans and players alike, with Linden admitting he was too excited to sleep the night before his first game back. He is still often referred to affectionately as &quot;Captain Canuck&quot;, despite not having captained the team since 1997. On April 5, 2008, the Canucks&#x27; final game of the 2007–08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation before the start of the third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose to their feet in recognition of Linden.

=== Community involvement ===
In addition to hockey, Linden has also undertaken a considerable amount of charitable work. Working primarily with children, he has made frequent appearances at the BC Children&#x27;s Hospital and Canuck Place, a hospice for terminally ill children. In 1995, he inaugurated the Trevor Linden Foundation to raise money for local charities and also hosts an annual golfing event as a fundraiser for BC Children&#x27;s Hospital. When he was awarded the Order of British Columbia in 2003, the citation referred to him as a &quot;hockey player and humanitarian&quot;. Linden has cited his brother, Dean, as being the inspiration for undertaking his charitable work, telling him to use his power as a hockey player.

In testament to his efforts off the ice in Vancouver, Linden has been a recipient of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy (1997) and the NHL Foundation Player Award (2008), honours awarded by the NHL to players for significant contributions in his community. Linden took part in the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay when the flame was in Vancouver before the opening ceremony. On December 30, 2010, it was announced that Linden was to be invested as a Member of the Order of Canada. He was cited &quot;[f]or his ongoing sportsmanship and community engagement as a respected leader both on and off the ice.&quot;

=== Management career ===
On April 9, 2014, he was named the president of hockey operations for the Canucks, replacing Mike Gillis in that role. Linden was hired by the Canucks the day after Gillis was fired, following a season where the team failed to become a playoff contender. On May 1, 2014, Linden fired head coach John Tortorella. Jim Benning, who was then serving as assistant general manager of the Boston Bruins, and a former Canuck and teammate of Linden in his playing career, was hired by Linden to replace Gillis as the Canucks&#x27; general manager on May 23. On June 23, 2014, Benning hired Willie Desjardins as the 18th head coach in Canucks history. On July 25, 2018, Linden parted ways with the Canucks organization.

== International play ==




Throughout his hockey career, Linden appeared in five international tournaments for Team Canada. He first appeared on the world stage at the 1988 World Junior Championships, a tournament Canada won, where he scored one goal. His first senior international tournament was the 1991 World Championship, in which he contributed one goal and four assists in ten games as Canada won the silver medal. Linden was also invited to training camp for the 1991 Canada Cup roster, but was released early. In the 1996 World Cup, the successor to the Canada Cup, Linden helped Canada to a second-place finish with a goal and an assist over eight games.

Two years later, Linden was selected as a member of Team Canada in the 1998 Nagano Olympics. Though he injured his knee only weeks before, he played in all six games, scoring one goal, a game-tying marker with 67 seconds left against the Czech Republic that sent the semi-final game to overtime. Canada finished fourth in the tournament. Later that summer, he participated in the 1998 World Championships. He scored one goal and four assists as Canada finished fifth.

<doc id="540314" wikidata="Q467691" url="?curid=540314" title="Ned Maddrell">
<text>Edward Maddrell (20 August 187727 December 1974) was a Manx fisherman who, at the time of his death, was the last surviving native speaker of the Manx language.

==Life==
Maddrell was born on 20 August 1877 at Corvalley, near Cregneash, on the Isle of Man, the son of Thomas Maddrell and Margaret Watterson. He spoke English until he moved to the village of Cregneash to live with relatives. It was here that Maddrell learned Manx, as his great-aunt Margaret Taubman could not speak English. Although Manx had begun to disappear as a community language for most of the Isle of Man in the second half of the 19th century, it lingered on slightly longer in some more remote areas such as Cregneash. Maddrell recalled having to act as an interpreter for the older inhabitants of the village who could not speak English.

At the age of 14 Maddrell began working as a cook on a fishing boat, sailing from Port St Mary to Kinsale in Ireland and to Shetland off Scotland in search of herring.

He married Mary Margaret Skelly of Croit-e-Caley on 3 January 1906.

He died on 27 December 1974, at the age of 97, and was buried in Rushen on 30 December.

==Irish Folklore Commission recordings==
Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera visited the Isle of Man in the summer of 1947. The Taoiseach had been instrumental in setting up the Irish Folklore Commission in 1935, which recorded living and dying Irish dialects, but also folklore and customs. During his trip to the Isle of Man, de Valera met Ned Maddrell at Harry Kelly&#x27;s cottage in the village of Cregneash.

As a result of his trip, the Taoiseach organised for Kevin Danaher of the Irish Folklore Commission to record the last remaining native speakers of Manx, as the Manx Museum did not have the facilities or funds to do so. Danaher travelled to the Isle of Man on 22 April 1948 with a crate of fragile acetate discs to record the Manx language. Maddrell, as well as several other elderly speakers, can be heard speaking or reciting songs in the recordings.

==Legacy==

Following the death of Sage Kinvig (–1962), Maddrell was the only remaining person who could claim to have spoken Manx Gaelic from childhood, although at the time some other people spoke it as a second language, having learned it later in life. (According to one source, Maddrell had some knowledge of English before he learned Manx, and learned Manx from his great-aunt.)

Maddrell recorded some of his speech for the sake of linguistic preservation; for example, in 1948 he recorded the following about fishing (in Manx, with the English translation):
:: &quot;Ballooilley&quot; said to him:
:: &quot;Are the crabs crawling, Joe?&quot;
:: &quot;Not much, not much,&quot; said Joe. &quot;They&#x27;re very scarce.&quot;

A newspaper article about the decline of Manx from about 1960 (Maddrell&#x27;s age was given as 82) mentions and quotes him, since at the time he was, along with Kinvig, one of only two native speakers:

Maddrell appears to have enjoyed his minor celebrity status, and was very willing to teach younger language revivalists such as Leslie Quirk and Brian Stowell.

The Manx language has undergone a revival since his death, partly thanks to the support that Ned Maddrell gave to younger learners of the language toward the end of his life. Today he is remembered by an annual lecture on Celtic language survival hosted by Culture Vannin and Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh.

<text>The Ford Explorer is a range of SUVs manufactured by Ford Motor Company since the 1991 model year. The first five-door SUV produced by Ford, the Explorer was introduced as a replacement for the three-door Bronco II. As with the Ford Ranger, the model line derives its name from a trim package previously offered on Ford F-Series pickup trucks. As of 2020, the Explorer became the best-selling SUV in the American market.

Currently in its sixth generation, the Explorer has featured a five-door wagon body style since its 1991 introduction. During the first two generations, the model line included a three-door wagon (directly replacing the Bronco II). The Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a crew-cab mid-size pickup derived from the second-generation Explorer. The fifth and sixth generations of the Explorer have been produced as the Ford Police Interceptor Utility (replacing both the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor and the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan).

Within North America&#x27;s current Ford SUV range, the Explorer is slotted between the Ford Edge and Ford Expedition. The model line has undergone rebranding several times, with Mazda, Mercury, and Lincoln each selling different versions. As of current production, Lincoln markets the Explorer as the Lincoln Aviator. For the North American market, the first four generations of the Explorer were produced by Ford at its Louisville Assembly Plant (Louisville, Kentucky) and at its now-closed St. Louis Assembly Plant (Hazelwood, Missouri); Ford currently assembles the Explorer with the Lincoln Aviator and the Police Interceptor Utility at its Chicago Assembly Plant (Chicago, Illinois).


==First generation (UN46; 1991)==

The Ford Explorer was introduced in March 1990 as an early 1991 model to replace the Bronco II. As Ford sought to balance off-road capability with family use of the vehicle, the Explorer underwent extensive design changes from its predecessor, though still retaining commonality with the Ranger pickup truck.

Growing from the compact Bronco II (similar in size to its 1960s namesake), the Explorer was a mid-size SUV, competing directly against the Jeep Cherokee and Chevrolet S-10 Blazer. To better compete against both model lines, a five-door body style was included as part of the launch (introduced in the same month as the five-door S-10 Blazer) alongside the three-door wagon. The new, wider body of the five-door allowed for three-across rear seating. To optimize cargo space usage, the traditional swing-away spare tire carrier was deleted in favor of an underfloor location. Similar to the Ford Taurus station wagon, the rear liftgate was fitted with a flip-up rear window.

=== Chassis ===
As with the Bronco II, the first-generation Explorer (design code UN46) shares its chassis underpinnings with the 1983–1992 Ford Ranger. The three-door version uses a 102.1-inch wheelbase (8.1 inches longer than the Bronco II); the five-door uses a 111.9 wheelbase (17.9 inches longer).

As with the Ranger, the UN46 Explorer has a Twin I-Beam (4×2) or Twin-Traction Beam (4×4) coil-sprung front independent suspension and a leaf-sprung solid rear axle. Brakes are discs in the front and drums in the rear, with anti-lock (ABS) on the rear only.

==== Powertrain ====
The first-generation Explorer was equipped with a 4.0 L &quot;Cologne&quot; V6, an optional engine for the Ranger and the Ford Aerostar. Initially producing , the engine output was raised to for 1993. A Mazda M5OD 5-speed manual was the standard transmission offering, with the option of the Ford 4-speed A4LD overdrive automatic transmission.

Along with the standard rear-wheel drive powertrain, at its launch, the Explorer was also offered with two configurations of part-time four-wheel drive, using a Borg Warner 13–54 transfer case. The &quot;Touch Drive&quot; electric-shift transfer case was standard (shared with the Ranger and the previous Bronco II); it allowed the vehicle to be shifted from two-wheel drive into high-range 4x4 drive (at any speed) and into low-range 4×4 (when stopped). As an option, the Explorer was also offered with a manual-shift transfer case (the option was paired with manual-locking hubs).

All Explorers were equipped with the Ford 8.8 axle in either a limited-slip differential or open version; multiple rear-axle ratios could be specified. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB (&quot;Twin Traction Beam&quot;) Dana 35 with some Dana 44-spec components; 4×2 models shared Twin I-Beam components with the Ranger.
=== Body ===
Shifting into the midsize SUV size class, the first-generation Explorer is far larger than the Bronco II. The three-door Explorer grew 12.6 inches in length, with the five-door Explorer 22.4 inches longer and 730 pounds heavier than the 1990 Bronco II.

As with the outgoing Bronco II, the Explorer shared many design elements with the 1989-1992 Ranger, adopting its front bumper, headlamps, and wheels; the grille was sourced from the off-road oriented Ranger STX (moving the Blue Oval to the top of the grille). Alongside the introduction of the five-door body style, the body was styled with multiple aerodynamic upgrades over its predecessor, including its own door stampings to eliminate exterior drip rails and bracket-mount sideview mirrors (replaced by ones integrated into the doors). In what would become a design feature of the model line, the B-pillar and D-pillars were blacked out. The three-door body shared a similar roofline as its five-door counterpart, fitted with pop-out rear quarter windows (instead of roll-down windows) and a forward-sloping C-pillar.

The interior of the Explorer was fitted largely with all-new trim (though carrying over the dashboard in its entirety from the Ranger/Bronco II), with model-specific door panels and seats. On three-door Explorers, four-passenger seating was carried over (though with a body increased over two inches in width), with front bucket seats and a split-folding rear bench. Five-door Explorers were fitted with standard front bucket seats and a three-passenger split-folding rear bench seat. A front split-bench seat was offered as an option (dependent on trim), expanding seating to six passengers. 

=== Trim ===

The first-generation Explorer followed the rest of the Ford light truck line in trim nomenclature, marketing a base-level XL trim and higher-range XLT trim. Sharing the features of the XLT, the outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer was the highest-range trim. The XL was distinguished by a black grille (chrome optional) with steel wheels, while the XLT offered a chrome grille and alloy wheels; the Eddie Bauer offered alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork.

The three-door Explorer differed slightly, sharing the XL and Eddie Bauer trims with the five-door. In place of the XLT trim, the Explorer Sport was offered, distinguished by its black lower bodywork, grille, and standard alloy wheels. From 1991 through 1994, the Explorer Sport was marketed by Mazda as the Mazda Navajo (see below); the 1991 Mazda Navajo became the first SUV to win the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Truck of the Year award.

For 1993, Ford introduced the Explorer Limited as a luxury-trim version of the model line, offered only as a five-door. Slotted above the Eddie Bauer, the Limited was largely introduced as a direct competitor for the Oldsmobile Bravada and Jeep Grand Wagoneer. Distinguished by its monochromatic exterior (including a color-matched grille, headlamp trim, and bumpers), the Limited was also fitted with model-specific alloy wheels and lower bodywork. The trim was fitted with nearly every feature available to the model line (the only options offered for the Explorer Limited were a sunroof, compact disc player, and the towing package), also serving as the introduction of several features offered as options on other trims for 1994, including an anti-theft system, keyless entry, and automatic headlights.

== Second generation (UN105/150; 1995)==
For the 1995 model year, Ford released a second generation of the Explorer. Following the success of the first generation, the redesign of the exterior was largely evolutionary, with the model line receiving front bodywork distinct from the Ranger. Rear-wheel drive remained standard, with part-time four-wheel drive offered as an option, and all-wheel drive was introduced as an option.

To better compete against the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a V8 was introduced as an optional engine. The Explorer went from lacking airbags to having dual airbags (a first for an American-brand SUV).

The Lincoln-Mercury division introduced its first SUV for the 1997 model year, the Mercury Mountaineer. In contrast to the Mazda Navajo, the Mountaineer was sold only as a five-door. For 2001, Ford introduced the Ford Explorer Sport Trac mid-size crew-cab pickup truck based on the five-door Explorer. Following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer for 2002, the three-door used the second-generation body style through the 2003 model year.

===Chassis===
The second-generation Ford Explorer is based upon the Ford U1 platform shared with its predecessor, adopting the UN105/UN150 model codes. Introducing key chassis upgrades that were also shared with the 1998 Ford Ranger, the long-running Twin I-Beam/Twin Traction Beam front suspension was retired in favor of a short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone front suspension configuration in order to accommodate larger engines. Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components (allowing for a lower hoodline), the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel. In line with the Ranger and F-Series trucks, the rear suspension remained a leaf-sprung live rear axle.

The standard four-wheel ABS of the previous generation returned; the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. As with the first generation, rear-wheel drive remained standard with part-time four-wheel drive as an option; all-wheel drive became an option for the first time.

====Powertrain====

The second generation Explorer carried over its 160 hp 4.0 L V6 from the previous generation (shared with the Ranger and Aerostar). For 1996, largely to match the V8 engine offerings of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Land Rover Discovery, a V8 (marketed as 5.0 L) was introduced as an option for rear-wheel drive XLT five-doors. By 1997, the V8 was offered with nearly all trims (except XL) and was paired with all-wheel drive; output was increased to (from revised cylinder heads).

For 1997, a third engine was added to the model line, as Ford introduced an overhead-cam version of the 4.0 L Cologne V6. Differing from its predecessor primarily by its single-overhead-cam drivetrain, the 210 hp engine rivaled the V8 in output. Introduced as standard equipment for Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, by 1998, the engine became offered on all non-XL trims. For 2001, the overhead-valve version of the 4.0 L V6 was discontinued, with the SOHC engine becoming standard (and the only engine of the Explorer Sport).

Following the introduction of the overhead-cam Triton-series V8s for the 1997 Ford F-Series and E-Series, the 2001 Explorer would be the final Ford Motor Company vehicle in North America sold with an overhead-valve gasoline-powered V8 engine for nearly two decades (until the 2020 introduction of the 7.3 L Godzilla V8 for Super Duty trucks).

For 2000, Ford added flex-fuel capability to the Explorer for the first time. The flex-fuel SOHC V6 and chassis were mated to an aluminum body built by Utilimaster in the Ford-Utilimaster FFV, a delivery vehicle built for the United States Postal Service in 2000 and 2001.

A Mazda-produced 5-speed manual was standard with the 4.0 L OHV V6 engine; the SOHC V6 was not offered with a manual transmission until 2000, receiving a heavier-duty version of the Mazda-sourced 5-speed. The V6 Explorers initially received a 4-speed automatic, shared with the Ranger and Aerostar, adopting a 5-speed automatic for 1997. The V8 was paired only with a 4-speed heavy-duty automatic (shared with the F-150, Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Mark VIII).

For the second-generation Explorer, the four-wheel drive system underwent a redesign. The previous Touch-Drive system (electrically operated) was retired and replaced by ControlTrac, an electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case; in place of a center differential, software-controlled multi-disc clutch. Similar to the previous push-button Touch-Drive system, a rotary dash selector was used for driver input, selecting two-wheel drive (rear wheels), and four-wheel drive (high and low range). As an intermediate mode, &quot;Auto&quot; mode allowed software to control the torque sent to the front wheels; if the rear axle began to spin, torque was shifted from the rear wheels to the front wheels until traction is achieved. The manually operated hubs and manual transfer cases were discontinued.

Similar to the system used on the Aerostar van, the V8 Explorer used a full-time all-wheel drive system without separate high or low ranges. The all-wheel drive&#x27;s torque distribution was via a viscous clutch with a 40/60 split.


=== Body ===
While bearing an evolutionary resemblance to the previous generation, nearly the entire body underwent a change, with only the roof and the side door stampings carried over. Coinciding with the lower hoodline allowed by the redesigned front suspension, much of the body was distinguished by a restyled front fascia, introducing a styling theme used by several other Ford light trucks during the late 1990s. The Ford Blue Oval was centered in a now-oval grille, joined by oval headlamp clusters wrapping into the fenders. In contrast to the front fascia, the rear body saw relatively few changes, receiving mildly restyled taillamps (with amber turn signals). In a functional change, the Explorer received a neon CHMSL (center brake light), adopted from the Lincoln Mark VIII.

While again directly sharing its dashboard with the Ranger, the interior of the Explorer underwent a complete redesign (allowing for the fitment of dual airbags). To improve driver ergonomics, the instrument panel received larger gauges, rotary-style climate controls, and a double-DIN radio panel.

For 1997, export-market Explorers received a third-row seat as an option (expanding seating to seven passengers).

For 1998, Ford gave the exterior of the model line a mid-cycle revision. Distinguished by body-color rear D-pillars and larger taillamps, the rear license plate was relocated from the rear bumper to the liftgate (to better accommodate export); the neon CHMSL was replaced by an LED version. In another change, 16-inch wheels were introduced. The interior received redesigned front and rear seats; alongside second-generation dual airbags, side airbags were introduced (as an option). Other options included load-leveling air suspension (on Eddie Bauer and Limited) and a reverse-sensing warning system. The rarely-specified 60/40 front bench seat was restricted to fleet vehicles after 1998 and was discontinued for 2000.

For 1999, the front bumper underwent a second revision, adding a larger cooling inlet and standard fog lights. All three-door Explorers were now renamed Explorer Sport.

For 2001, the three-door Explorer Sport underwent an additional revision, now sharing the front fascia and interior with the newly introduced Explorer Sport Trac pickup truck.

For 2002, the five-door body style would be replaced by an all new Explorer, with only the three-door Explorer Sport and Sport Trac maintaining the second-generation architecture. Styling changes for the Sport are minimal, with the rear wiper moving from the tailgate assembly to being built into the rear window.

=== Trim ===

At its launch, the second-generation Ford Explorer retained the use of the previous trim nomenclature; the standard trim was the XL, with the XLT serving as the primary model upgrade. Along with the two-tone Eddie Bauer trim, the highest trim Explorer was the monochromatic Ford Explorer Limited. For 2000, XLS replaced XL as the base trim (introduced as an appearance package for 1999).

In contrast to five-door Explorers, second-generation three-door Ford Explorers shifted to a separate trim nomenclature. While the XL remained the base model (largely for fleets), most examples were produced under a single Sport trim level (again equipped similarly to the XLT). For 1995, Ford replaced the 3-door Eddie Bauer with the Expedition trim; in anticipation of the full-size Ford Expedition SUV, the trim line was withdrawn for the 1996 model year.

For 1999, all three-door Explorers became Explorer Sports; the model was produced alongside the third-generation Explorer through the 2003 model year.

=== Epilogue ===

Outside of North America, this generation of the Explorer was marketed in right-hand drive configurations. As of 2018, RHD countries (such as Japan) export used examples of the Explorer to other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand) where there is demand for right-hand drive SUVs. Due to Japan&#x27;s strict Shaken Laws, used vehicles tend to have low mileage with detailed repair histories.

In the United States, the second-generation Ford Explorer has the (dubious) distinction of being two of the top five vehicles traded-in under the 2009 &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot; program, with the 4WD model topping the list and the 2WD model coming in at number 4.
==Third generation (U152; 2002)==
The third-generation Ford Explorer went on sale in January 2001 for the 2002 model year. Undergoing the first complete redesign since its introduction, the Explorer ended its direct model commonality with the Ford Ranger in favor of a purpose-built SUV design. Following a decline in demand for three-door SUVs, Ford developed the third-generation Explorer solely as a five-door wagon; the three-door Explorer Sport from the second generation continued production through the 2003 model year.

The primary objective behind the development of the model line was to make the Explorer more competitive in both domestic and export markets. Along with tuning the vehicle for higher-speed European driving, Ford also benchmarked the model line against the Lexus RX300 and the (then-in-development) Volkswagen Touareg. The Lincoln-Mercury division marketed the third-generation Explorer, with Mercury introducing a second generation of the Mercury Mountaineer; Lincoln offered its first version of the Explorer, marketing the Lincoln Aviator from 2003 until 2005.

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Explorer (design code U152) marked a major change in the model line, ending chassis commonality with the Ford Ranger. While still retaining body-on-frame construction, the U152 chassis was developed specifically for the third-generation Explorer (and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts). The wheelbase was extended slightly, to 113.7 inches. Along with rear-wheel drive, the third-generation Explorer was offered with both four-wheel drive and permanent all-wheel drive.

Following the redesign of the front suspension of the previous-generation Explorer, Ford redesigned the suspension layout of the rear axle, replacing the leaf-sprung live rear axle with an independent rear axle located by two half-shafts (similar to the Ford MN12 chassis). The 4-wheel independent configuration was a first for Ford Motor Company trucks and American-market SUVs (with the exception of the HMMWV-derived Hummer H1). As with the previous generation, four-wheel disc brakes were standard with an anti-lock braking system.

==== Powertrain ====
Carried over from the previous generation, a 210 hp 4.0 L V6 was the standard engine. The 5.0 L V8 of the previous generation was retired, with the Explorer adopting a 239 hp 4.6 L Modular V8 as its optional engine (shared with the Ford Crown Victoria/Mercury Grand Marquis); the Explorer was the final V8-powered American Ford to adopt the 4.6 L engine.

For 2002, a 5-speed manual transmission was standard equipment with the 4.0 L V6, the final year a manual transmission was offered for the model line. From 2003 through 2005, the Ford 5R55 5-speed automatic transmission (previously optional for the 4.0 L V6) was paired with the 4.0 L V6 and the 4.6 L V8.

=== Body ===

In contrast with the second-generation Ford Explorer (a major revision of the first-generation model line), the third-generation Ford Explorer was a ground-up redesign (ending all body commonality with the Ford Ranger). Offered solely as a five-door wagon, the model line returned several exterior design elements from previous-generation Explorers (blacked-out B and D-pillars, quarter glass in the rear doors); the grille and taillights were elements adopted from the larger Ford Expedition. The 2002 Ford Explorer introduced a design theme adopted by multiple Ford vehicles, including the 2003 Ford Expedition, the 2004 Ford Freestar, and the 2005 Ford Freestyle wagon and Five Hundred sedan.

Proportioned nearly identically the same as the previous two generations, the third-generation Explorer was an inch shorter, two inches wider, and two inches longer in wheelbase. Several functional changes were brought to the Explorer as part of the rear suspension redesign. The change allowed for a lower rear cargo floor, adding nearly 10 cubic feet of additional cargo space. Offered on nearly all versions, a folding third-row seat was offered as either standard equipment or as an option (expanding seating to seven passengers). For 2004, a rear-bucket seat configuration became an option for higher-trim models, including a second center console (reducing seating to six). Following the design of previous generations, the third-generation Explorer again received a multi-opening rear liftgate, enlarging the rear window opening (covered partially by a filler panel, housing the rear windshield washer).

=== Trim ===

For the 2002 model year, the third-generation Ford Explorer adopted the trim nomenclature of its predecessor. The base trim of the model line was the XLS (intended largely for fleet sale) with the newly introduced XLS Sport, which standardized many options offered for the XLS. The primary trim level of the Explorer was the XLT, split into two versions; the standard XLT received a monochromatic exterior and the XLT Sport received gray lower-body trim and 17-inch wheels. The Eddie Bauer and Limited returned as the highest-trim versions of the Explorer, with the Eddie Bauer distinguished by tan lower-body trim; the Limited was styled with a body-color exterior.

For 2003 and 2004, Ford marketed the Explorer NBX trim. Equipped between the XLT and Eddie Bauer/Limited, the Explorer NBX was an off-road oriented version of the Explorer equipped with all-terrain tires, black bumpers and body cladding, heavy-duty roof rack, and custom seat trim. The NBX was also offered with an Off-Road option package; offered with any four-wheel drive Explorer, the option featured skid plates, tow hooks, and upgraded suspension.

=== Safety ===
Undergoing development during the late 1990s, the third-generation Explorer adopted safety features in response to the tread separation controversy that affected the previous-generation model line. Along with the deletion of the Firestone Wilderness AT tires, to further reduce rollover risk, the front and rear axles were widened (the latter, coinciding with the introduction of independent rear suspension). As an option, AdvanceTrac was introduced as a stability control system. For 2005, AdvanceTrac was redesigned, becoming AdvanceTrac RSC (Roll Stability Control); included as a standard feature, the system used ABS, traction control, stability control, and yaw control to reduce rollover risk.

In addition to standard dual front-seat airbags, seatbelt pretensioners were added; side-curtain airbags became an option on all versions of the model line.

==Fourth generation (U251; 2006)==
The fourth generation Explorer entered production in July 2005 for the 2006 model year. While the Mercury Mountaineer also returned for 2006, the fourth generation Explorer did not have a Lincoln Aviator counterpart, as it was dropped following the 2005 model year. Bearing large similarities to the outgoing model, the fourth generation Explorer was marketed as all-new by Ford despite sharing its roof line, overall body, glass, base drive-train, and several other major components with its predecessor. In contrast, it rides on a new, stiffer frame produced by &quot;Magna International&quot; rather than &quot;Tower Automotive&quot;. Along with this new chassis, Ford updated the front and rear fascias, side profile, interior, and redesigned the rear suspension. Moreover, the problematic two-piece tail gate design from the outgoing model was replaced with a one-piece tail gate design. Also, a tire pressure monitoring system and electronic stability control became standard equipment for improved safety. Unlike previous generations, there was no right-hand drive option available for order, causing Ford to market Explorers in Japan in left-hand drive configuration.

This generation Explorer would be the last to use body on frame construction as future Explorers, beginning in 2011, would use unibody construction. Additionally, it was the last generation to be produced in Louisville, Kentucky.

The 4.0 L 12-valve SOHC V6 was once again the standard engine, paired to an updated version of the 5R55 transmission. A new 4.6 L 24-valve SOHC V8, similar to the Fifth-generation Ford Mustang&#x27;s engine, was available as an option, paired to a new 6-speed 6R automatic transmission, built by Ford and based on a ZF design.

The 2006 Ford Explorer was nominated for the &quot;North American Truck of the Year&quot; award for 2006.

The fourth generation Explorer was the last Explorer generation to also have a Mercury Mountaineer counterpart as Mercury was dissolved in 2011.

===Model year changes===
For 2007, the Explorer received a few minor updates including a standard AUX input on all stereos, an optional heated windshield, an Ironman Package, an XLT Appearance Package, and a heated leather seat package. The XLS trim was also dropped for 2007, and the XLT became the base model. Additionally, the leather-wrapped steering wheel, power driver seat, and dual illuminated vanity mirrors were deleted as standard equipment on the XLT trim. Side curtain airbags were optional on Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, while XLT models were only offered with seat-mounted side torso airbags as standard equipment. Moreover, power-deployable running boards, like the ones from the Lincoln Navigator, were also made available for Eddie Bauer and Limited trims; the running boards lower to allow easier access when entering the vehicle, then retract upon door closure. In addition, the Ford Explorer Sport Trac was also re-introduced for the 2007 model year after skipping 2006.

For 2008, Ford added standard side curtain airbags on all Explorers. Notably, the 2008 Ford Explorer also became the first Ford vehicle to utilize the cap-less fuel filler system, though Explorers were not equipped with it until mid-year 2008. Three new colors were added for the 2008 model year: Stone Green clearcoat metallic, Vapor Silver clearcoat metallic, and White Suede clearcoat metallic. All Explorers now came standard with body-color fender lip and bumper cladding, while Eddie Bauer models received standard Pueblo Gold cladding. In a minor change, the AdvanceTrac badge on the trunk door was replaced with a &quot;4X4&quot; badge on 4WD models. In a reversal from the 2007 model year, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, a power driver seat, and dual illuminated vanity mirrors were once again standard on the XLT. In addition, XLT models also now received puddle lights, and a standard overhead console. Furthermore, Ford SYNC was now optional on all Ford Explorer models and the optional satellite navigation system was upgraded with voice control. The Ironman appearance package was dropped after the 2008 model year.

For 2009, the Explorer received a trailer sway control system as standard equipment, and the navigation system received traffic flow monitoring with updated gas prices from nearby stations. Revised front headrests, which improve protection in rear end collisions, were also standard for the 2009 model year. The torque output of the V8 engine increased from to , while power numbers remained the same.

For the 2010 model year, Ford&#x27;s MyKey became standard on all Explorers equipped with the Sync system, while V8s were restricted to 4-wheel-drive models.

The last fourth generation Explorer rolled off the assembly line on December 16, 2010.

===Engine specifications===


===Explorer Ironman===
In 2005, Ford signed a three-year deal to sponsor the Ironman Triathlon. Ford Explorer marketing manager Glen Burke compared the Explorer and the Ironman Triathlon; noting that both had the same attributes of strength, endurance, and passion. The Explorer Ironman debuted on June 25, 2006, for the 2007 model year was an interior and exterior appearance package for the XLT trim. It featured a blacked-out front grille, a protruding silver lower grille with rivet patterns and &quot;Ironman&quot; embossing, a unique rear fascia, Ironman badging, smoked headlights, amber fog lights, blacked-out fender flares with rivet patterns, and unique 18-inch wheels. The interior featured unique heated ten-way power-adjustable two-tone black and stone leather seats, as well as silver trim around the radio and climate controls. Additionally, a leather-wrapped steering wheel was standard. The Explorer Ironman was available in only five colors: Oxford White, Ebony, Redfire, Silver Birch, as well as Orange Frost; which was a unique color only available with the Ironman package. The Ironman could be had with either the standard 4.0 L SOHC V6 or the 4.6 L V8, and in either standard RWD or 4WD configurations. The Explorer Ironman went on sale in September 2006 as a 2007 model, and it was discontinued after the 2008 model year.

===Ford Explorer Sport Trac===
The second generation Sport Trac was released in early 2006 for the 2007 model year. Unlike its predecessor sold through 2005, it featured the V8 engine as an option and was based on this generation Explorer&#x27;s platform. In addition, &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; electronic stability control with &quot;Roll Stability Control&quot; was now made standard on the Sport Trac.

===Sport Trac Adrenalin===
For the 2007 model year, the Ford Special Vehicle Team built the &quot;Sport Trac Adrenalin&quot; concept with a supercharged version of the 4.6 L &quot;Modular&quot; V8, with , and featuring wheels. The model was planned by Ford SVT to be the successor to the F-150 Lightning sports pickup truck. However, the SVT version of the Adrenalin was cancelled in a cost-cutting move as part of &quot;The Way Forward&quot;. The Adrenalin was subsequently sold as an appearance package from 2007 until 2010. It had blacked-out headlights, black grill, monochrome color interior, unique front and rear bumpers, front fender vents, and molded-in running boards. It also came standard with 20-inch polished aluminum wheels, and the fender flares that came on the Explorer and standard Sport Trac were deleted.

===Explorer America concept===
Ford unveiled the Explorer America concept vehicle at the 2008 North American International Auto Show. The concept design uses a unibody platform to reduce weight and improve driveability, migrating from the body-on-frame platform of the fourth generation Explorer. It has room for six passengers while improving fuel economy by 20 to 30 percent relative to the current V6 Explorer. The powertrain in the concept include a 2 L four-cylinder turbocharged direct injection &quot;EcoBoost&quot; gas engine with and of torque or a 3.5 L V6 version &quot;EcoBoost&quot; with and up to of torque.

==Fifth generation (U502; 2011)==

The fifth generation 2011 Explorer features a unibody structure based on the D4 platform shared with the Ford Flex and Lincoln MKT — a modified version of the D3 platform. 

The fifth generation Explorer features blacked-out A, B, and D-pillars, sculpted body work, stepped style headlamps and tail lamps, and a variant of the corporate three-bar design with upper and lower perforated mesh work.

Chief engineer Jim Holland led the development of the fifth generation Explorer from February 2008 to October 2010, during a period when Ford&#x27;s Premier Automotive Group also owned Land Rover — for which Holland was also a chief engineer, heading development of the Land Rover Range Rover (L322) 2005 facelift from December 2001 to December 2004. Holland also worked on the Ford Expedition (U324) during its initial development.

Ford presented the fifth generation Explorer on July 26, 2010, via Facebook. Assembly of the fifth-generation Explorer moved to Ford&#x27;s Chicago Assembly plant commencing December 1, 2010, where it was manufactured alongside the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS. The Louisville plant, where the previous generation was manufactured, was converted to produce cars based on Ford&#x27;s global C platform (potentially including the Ford Focus, Ford C-Max, and Ford Kuga). Like the Escape, the Explorer continued to be marketed as an &quot;SUV&quot; rather than a &quot;crossover SUV&quot;. It went on sale in December 2010, after pre-launch sales had by the end of November 2010 totaled around 15,000. The EPA rated fuel economy of 20/28 mpg city/highway for the four-cylinder EcoBoost engine option.

===Features===
Available features on the fifth generation Explorer included intelligent access with push button start, remote engine start, power liftgate, power adjustable pedals with memory, premium leather trimmed seating, heated and cooled front seats, dual headrest DVD entertainment system, adaptive cruise control, active park assist, SIRIUS Travel Link, MyFord Touch, Ford SYNC by Microsoft, Sony audio system with HD radio and Apple iTunes tagging, in-dash advanced navigation system, SoundScreen laminated acoustic and solar tinted windshield with rain-sensing wipers, 20-inch polished V-spoke aluminium wheels, and High-intensity discharge headlamps (HID) and LED tail lamps.

Unlike the Explorer America concept vehicle which only seats five occupants, the production Explorer holds two rows of seating with available &quot;PowerFold&quot; fold-flat third-row seating (like the previous generation) and accommodates up to seven occupants.

===Capability===
The Explorer was available in either front-wheel drive or full-time all-wheel drive. At first only one engine was available: the ( of torque) 3.5 L TiVCT (Twin independent Variable Camshaft Timing) V6 with either the 6-speed 6F automatic or 6-speed 6F &quot;SelectShift&quot; automatic.

Soon thereafter, Ford offered the and ( of torque) 2 L &quot;EcoBoost&quot; turbocharged, direct-injected I-4 mated to the 6-speed 6F automatic. The I-4 engine was not available with the optional 6-speed 6F SelectShift automatic, and was only available in front-wheel drive.

The Explorer was available with an automatic intelligent all-wheel drive system inspired by Land Rover, featuring a variable center multi-disc differential with computer controlled lock. Conventional front and rear differentials are used with 3.39:1 gearing. The center multi-disc differential controls the front-to-rear torque split, biasing as much as 100 percent of torque to either the front or rear wheels. Depending on the Terrain Management mode selected, the center multi-disc differential&#x27;s intelligent lock will allow for a 50:50 torque split in off-road conditions. The Power Transfer Unit (PTU) includes a heavy-duty dedicated cooling system to allow the four-wheel drive system to supply continuous non-stop torque delivery to all four wheels indefinitely, without overheating. A &quot;4WD&quot; badge is advertised on the rear liftgate on the all-wheel drive models. Explorer&#x27;s overall off-road crawl ratio is 15.19:1 with high range – no low range – gearing.

Off-road electronics include Hill Descent Control (HDC), Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), four-wheel electronic traction control and Terrain Management.

Four-wheel electronic traction control (ABS braking) is employed to simulate front and rear differential locks via aggressively &quot;brake locking&quot; the front or rear differentials, transferring up to 100 percent of torque from side-to-side. In the right conditions, the Explorer can keep moving even if only one wheel has traction.

Terrain Management includes four selectable modes. Each mode is selected via a rotary control dial on the center console, aft of the transmission shifter.

Depending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine-tune the engine, transmission, center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, four-wheel electronic traction control and electronic stability control (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp breakover angles are 21°, 21° and 16° respectively. Minimum running ground clearance is . Standard running ground clearance is . Low hanging running boards are no longer offered from the factory to help increase side obstacle clearance.

Moving to a monocoque body usually has a negative impact on towing capacity. The new Explorer will be available with an optional trailer tow package. The package includes a Class III trailer hitch, engine oil cooler, trailer electrics connector, trailer sway control (TSC), wiring harness and a rear-view camera with trailer alignment assistance to help in backing up to a trailer. If equipped with the trailer tow package the new 2011 Explorer will be able to tow up to of braked trailer. That is greater than the towing capacity stated for the Explorer America concept and less than the outgoing Explorer&#x27;s towing capacity, although that was only available with the 4.6 L V8 engine.

=== Safety and security ===
Safety features include: Dual front adaptive SRS airbags, dual front-seat side-impact airbags, dual rear safety belt airbags (beginning first quarter, 2011), and side curtain head, torso and rollover protection airbags. Other optional safety features include BLIS blind spot information system with rear cross traffic alert, forward collision warning with brake support precrash system, Auto high-beam, Roll Stability Control (RSC), Electronic stability control (ESC) and Curve Control.

The fifth-generation Explorer was the first-ever vehicle to be equipped with dual rear inflatable safety belts. Airbags are sewn into the inside of the seat belts, and inflate with cold air to prevent burns. Ford claims it will be released as an option and to introduce inflatable seat belts on other Ford models eventually.

===Awards===
The fifth generation Ford Explorer earned the 2011 &quot;North American Truck of the Year&quot; award. The rear inflatable seat belts won the 2011 Best New Technology Award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada.

===2013 Ford Explorer Sport===
The Ford Explorer Sport was announced on March 28, 2012, as an option for the 2013 model year and went on sale in June 2012. The &quot;Sport&quot; trim level comprises blackened exterior treatments, stiffened chassis and suspension, larger brakes and the installation of the EcoBoost 3.5L twin turbo V6 rated at and of torque. It was at the time the only version to feature a combined 4WD/EcoBoost option (an FWD version is not being offered for the Sport trim; 2016+ facelifted models offered the 2.3• EcoBoost with 4WD), allowing its MPG to average between 16/city and 22/highway. This version was slotted above the Limited trim and competed against Jeep Grand Cherokee&#x27;s SRT trim and Dodge Durango&#x27;s R/T trims and a newly updated 2013 Chevrolet Traverse, the latter of which unveiled their new look on the same day as the Explorer Sport as their response to Ford&#x27;s news.
===2016 facelift===

The refreshed 2016 model year Ford Explorer debuted at the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show, with a redesigned front fascia, hood, and lower bumper, standard LED low-beam headlights, and fog lamps that were inspired by the thirteenth generation Ford F-150. The rear of the Explorer was also refreshed with restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. The 2016 refresh bumped the I4 engine to a 2.3 L EcoBoost four-cylinder engine from the 2015 Ford Mustang. A newly introduced &quot;Platinum&quot; trim now tops out the range, slotting above the Sport and Limited trims. Similar to the Platinum editions of the F150 and Ford Super Duty trucks, the Platinum trim features front and rear cameras, enhanced active park assist with perpendicular park assist, park-out assist and semi-automatic parallel parking, hands-free liftgate from the Ford Escape, an exclusive 500-watt Sony surround sound system, and a heated steering wheel. The Platinum is paired with a 3.5 L EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 with which was previously only available with the Sport trim. The 2016 Explorer went on sale at dealerships in the middle of 2015. The base Explorer also received standard eighteen-inch alloy wheels.

===2018 and 2019 updates===
For 2018, the fifth-generation Ford Explorer received a front fascia update including new front LED fog lights (not available on the base model Explorer) and a new grille design. Also added was an optional Ford Safe and Smart Package (standard on Platinum models), which gives customers several of Ford&#x27;s safety features, and the Explorer Sport and Platinum received new quad-exhaust tips.

In 2019, the Explorer received one last update before it would be completely redesigned for the sixth-generation Explorer. Explorer XLT models received an optional XLT Desert Copper Package, priced at an additional US$1,840. The package included an ebony interior with copper inserts, chrome mirror caps, and 20” Polished Aluminum wheels. Explorer Limited models also received an optional Limited Luxury Package, priced at an additional $1,905. The package included upgraded premium leather seats with unique stitching, premium leather wrapped steering wheel and door inserts, multi-contour with massage capability driver and passenger front seats, inflatable passenger seat belts, chrome mirror caps, and 20” aluminum wheels. These Explorer packages were introduced to celebrate Ford&#x27;s new record SUV sales at the State Fair of Texas where two Ford Expedition packages (Expedition Stealth Edition and Texas Edition) were also revealed alongside the Explorer.

===Engines===

== Sixth generation (U625; 2020) ==
The sixth-generation Ford Explorer debuted on January 9, 2019, ahead of the 2019 North American International Auto Show. The 2020 Ford Explorer uses the rear-wheel-drive based CD6 platform shared with the new Lincoln Aviator.

The turbocharged 2.3 L EcoBoost inline-four is the standard engine, with and of torque. It comes with a 10-speed automatic transmission and either rear- or all-wheel drive. Its maximum tow rating is . An optional twin-turbocharged 3.0 L EcoBoost V6 makes and of torque, while the ST with the same engine makes and of torque. It also mates with a 10-speed automatic and sees an increase in towing capacity, to .

An Explorer Hybrid is also available in the US with a detuned 3.3 L V6 and 1.5 kWh lithium-ion battery producing a combined . In Europe there is an available plug-in hybrid version that includes a 3.0 L V6 petrol engine, electric motor, and 13.6 kWh lithium-ion battery for a combined output of and . It will have a fuel consumption of and can tow .

The 2020 Explorer comes in four trim levels: XLT, Limited, ST, and Platinum. The base Explorer is marketed primarily y to fleet buyers, and will not be available for retail sale.

Thousands of initial Explorer and Aviator vehicles were shipped to Ford&#x27;s Flat Rock Assembly Plant for repairs due to quality control problems. Later models have been shipped from the Chicago plant to dealerships; however, many required dealer repairs before they could be sold. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; noted their purchased Aviator was having quality problems.

===2022 model year===

For the 2022 model year, a rear-wheel drive version of the Explorer ST became available, as did a hybrid version of the range-topping Platinum. The XLT gained a new Appearance Package with unique aluminum-alloy wheels and seating surfaces. Added mid-year 2021, the &quot;Timberline&quot; trim is based on the mid-level XLT, and adds unique heathered cloth and ActiveX (leatherette)-trimmed seating surfaces, all-terrain tires, and unique exterior and interior styling details. A new &quot;ST Line&quot; trim, also based on the mid-level XLT, adds exterior and interior styling elements from the performance-oriented ST, but does not include the 3.0-liter EcoBoost twin-turbocharged V6 engine, and is instead powered by the base 2.3-liter EcoBoost inline four-cylinder engine. The ST Line offers an optional Bang and Olufsen premium surround sound audio system with an external amplifier, which was previously only offered on Limited trims and above.

=== 2025 refresh ===
The facelifted 6th generation Ford Explorer was revealed on February 1, 2024, for the 2025 model year, It features a redesigned front fascia with a larger grille, revised, sleeker headlights and taillights, and a revised interior with the addition of a 13.2-inch touchscreen and 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, standard on all models. The previous eight trim levels was reduced to four, namely the Active, ST-Line, ST, and Platinum.

===Engines===

===China===
The Chinese market Ford Explorer received a facelift for the 2023 model year and was unveiled in August 2022, with orders received from August 11, and production kicking off on November 7. The facelift is exclusive to the Chinese market with revised front and rear end designs and the dashboard now accommodates a 27-inch touchscreen.

=== Safety ===
The 2020 Explorer was awarded the &quot;Top Safety Pick +&quot; by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.


== Variants and derivatives ==

=== 3-door / Explorer Sport ===
As the direct successor of the Bronco II, Ford developed a three-door version of the Explorer for the 1991 model year; while 10 inches shorter than its five-door counterpart, the three-door was still nearly 13 inches longer than the Bronco II. For the first generation, the three-door was available in XL, Sport, and Eddie Bauer trims, with Sport offered as a trim exclusive to the three-door, distinguished by black-colored wheel wells and rocker panels. For 1995, Expedition was offered as a trim package for the three-door Explorer; replacing the Eddie Bauer trim, the nameplate was retired after 1995 in preparation for the 1997 full-size four-door SUV.

During the second generation, the XL trim was retired for the 1999 model year, with all three-door Explorers becoming Explorer Sports. For 2001, the Explorer Sport was split from the five-door Explorer, retaining the second-generation body and chassis and adopting the front fascia and interior of the Explorer Sport Trac.

Ford discontinued the Explorer Sport following the 2003 model year with no direct replacement due to the declining popularity of three-door SUVs, with the final vehicle produced in July 2003.
=== Explorer Sport Trac ===

Introduced in 2000 as a 2001 model, the Explorer Sport Trac is a mid-size pickup truck derived from the second-generation Explorer, becoming the first mid-size Ford pickup. In contrast to the Ranger, the Sport Trac was marketed primarily as a personal-use vehicle rather than for work use.

Offered solely as a four-door crew cab, the design of the Sport Trac shared commonality with multiple vehicles. Sharing the frame and wheelbase of the Ranger SuperCab, the Sport Trac combined the front fascia of the Explorer Sport with a crew cab derived from the four-door Explorer; the pickup bed (designed for the model line) shared its tailgate with the F-150 SuperCrew.

The 2001–2005 Sport Trac was the final version of the Explorer derived from the Ranger. After skipping the 2006 model year, a second-generation Sport Trac was produced from 2007 until 2010 (derived from the fourth-generation Explorer).

=== Police Interceptor Utility ===

Following the end of production of the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (CVPI) in 2011, Ford developed two new models to replace it, as part of their Ford Police Interceptor range. For the 2013 model year, Ford introduced the Taurus-based Ford Police Interceptor Sedan (FPIS) and Explorer-based Ford Police Interceptor Utility (FPIU). Both models were designed &amp; assembled alongside each other and were platform mates. As such, many mechanical parts, repair techniques, specifications, and vehicle interfaces were intentionally the same between the two vehicles to facilitate easier repairs and user familiarity. Like the CVPI, the Ford Expedition SSV, and the Taurus-based FPIS, the FPIU was not made available for retail sale.

Unlike the outgoing CVPI and the Expedition SSV, the FPIU was unavailable with a V8 engine. Instead, it was equipped with a 3.7 L Cyclone V6 used in the Ford Mustang, but in a transverse arrangement as the standard engine. It made and of torque, and was flex fuel capable. Permanent torque-vectoring all-wheel drive was standard across the line. For the 2014 model year, a 3.5 L twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, shared with the Explorer Sport, Taurus SHO, and FPIS was added to the lineup making and of torque. All iterations of the FPIU used a variant of Ford&#x27;s 6F six-speed automatic transmission.

Visually, the FPIU could be easily told apart from a standard Ford Explorer. It featured a black front grille with black exterior trim, black steel wheels with chrome center caps or plastic hubcaps, a keyhole on the trunk door, &quot;Police Interceptor&quot; badging on the trunk door, and no roof rails. The EcoBoost FPIU featured several distinct visual cues that set it apart from its non-turbocharged counterpart. The EcoBoost variant featured a different grille, similar to that of the FPIS, large &quot;INTERCEPTOR&quot; badging across the hood lip, and an EcoBoost badge on the trunk. The daytime running lamps on the Explorer were removed for FPIUs and the turn signals act in place of them.
Many standard features that were fitted to the FPIU were not available on the standard Ford Explorer, including rear impact protection; a police calibrated ECM for high performance driving &amp; long idling times; a heavy duty cooling system that included a larger radiator, an engine oil cooler, transmission cooler, power transfer unit (PTU) cooler, and police-calibrated radiator fan settings; a 220-amp alternator; heavy duty 13-inch brake rotors with special ventilation &amp; 18-inch five spoke steel wheels; true dual exhaust; a police-tuned suspension with heavy duty components; raised ride height; steel deflector plates along the underbody; reinforced frame points; reinforced front door hinges; factory provisions to add emergency equipment, and a specially tuned electronic stability control system tailored to emergency style driving. Interior-wise, the FPIU differentiated from the standard Ford Explorer, featuring a column shifter as opposed to a floor shifter, mappable steering wheel controls, a certified-calibration speedometer, heavy-duty cloth front seats with stab-proof front seat backs, a vinyl rear seat without headrests, vinyl flooring, and the ability to disable the rear door locks and window switches. A third-row seating option was not available on the FPIU. Some features found on a standard Ford Explorer were available as standalone options on the FPIU, such as Ford SYNC, a rearview camera, reverse sensors, blind spot monitoring, keyless entry, exterior fog lamps, automatic headlights, and rear headliner mounted HVAC vents.

The Ford Police Interceptor Utility proved to be popular outselling the FPIS, and became ubiquitous with law enforcement as the CVPI was being phased out. The California Highway Patrol began to use the Police Interceptor Utility as a CVPI replacement because the FPIS, Chevrolet Caprice, and Dodge Charger patrol cars did not meet the payload the CHP requires for a universal patrol car. In May 2014, statistician R.L. Polk declared the FPIU the most popular police vehicle, based on 2013 U.S. sales figures.

For the 2016 model year, the FPIU was refreshed along with the rest of the Explorer line. Though powertrain options remained the same, the FPIU received an upgraded electrical system, a new front fascia with LED reflector headlights, a new rear fascia, and an unlock button on the trunk. Inside, the FPIU received a new steering wheel, new interior trim, and a revised center stack. The electronic stability control system was re-tuned to allow for J-turns. A perimeter alarm was introduced as an option that automatically locked the doors and closed the windows if anyone attempted to approach the vehicle from its blind spots.

====Second generation====
For the 2020 model year, Ford released a second-generation Police Interceptor Utility, derived from the sixth-generation Explorer. Offered exclusively in a permanent all-wheel drive configuration, it now rides on Ford&#x27;s all-new rear-wheel drive based CD6 platform. The second generation FPIU does not have a sedan counterpart; the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan was discontinued in 2019.

Many of the same Utility-specific standard features were carried over from the first-generation version. For the first time, the FPIU was offered in a hybrid drive-train configuration. Bluetooth is now standard as is a 250 amp alternator, Ford Telematics, and dual-zone front temperature control. A 12.1-inch center stack display is now optional, and the optional perimeter alarm has been advanced. The second generation FPIU gains cargo space (even with hybrid batteries on board) over its predecessor.

The second generation FPIU was offered with three all-new engine choices: a twin-turbocharged 3.0L EcoBoost V6 making and of torque, a 3.3L Hybrid V6 making and of torque, and a naturally aspirated 3.3 L V6 engine making and of torque, the latter of which is unavailable on the retail Ford Explorer. All iterations of the second-generation FPIU use a 10-speed automatic transmission. Notably, the 3.0 L EcoBoost V6 Utility was the quickest police vehicle available in Michigan State Police testing with a time of 5.5 seconds and a top speed of .

The new hybrid system is based on Ford&#x27;s fourth-generation modular hybrid system, which shares up to 90% of its parts with the Escape Hybrid and F-150 Hybrid. It is estimated that the hybrid drive-train will save departments between $3,500 and $5,700 a year per vehicle in fuel costs. In total, the hybrid system increased the combined fuel economy of the Utility from to , a 26% increase.

====2025 Update====
For the 2025 model year, the FPIU received several updates; it coincided with the mid-cycle refresh of the retail Explorer. Unlike its retail counterpart, the front fascia retained the same styling as its 2024 predecessor. According to Ford, this was done to streamline up-fitting and reduce costs so that agencies can directly swap equipment from previous model years (such as emergency lights and push bumpers) to a new vehicle. The rear fascia, however, received new tail lamps and a re-designed hatch filler trim in between the tail lamps.

New features for the 2025 FPIU include a larger center stack display with enhanced graphics and advanced OTA (Over the Air) capabilities. Additionally, Ford&#x27;s new Upfit Pro Integration System is now standard, which streamlines the up-fitting process for interior emergency response equipment on new police vehicles. Like the exterior, the interior design largely remained the same and was not updated like the interior of the retail Explorer.

Mechanically, power-trains were carried over, with the 3.3L Hybrid V6 returning as the standard engine choice. However, a new manual pursuit mode has been added to supplant the automatic pursuit mode feature; it enhances drive-ability and power delivery in heavy-traffic emergency response driving situations.

Moreover, several additional safety features are now standard. Automatic emergency braking is now standard along with blind spot monitoring and cross traffic brake assist. In addition, Ford&#x27;s Police Perimeter Alerts system, which was previously optional, is now standard.

The updated 2025 FPIU was available to order beginning on February 15, 2024.

Ford Police Interceptor Utility Performance Specs (based on Michigan State Police testing): 


=== Mazda Navajo ===
The first-generation Ford Explorer was sold by Mazda from 1991 until 1994 as the Mazda Navajo. Offered solely in a three-door configuration, only minor design details differed the Navajo from its Ford counterpart.

In the early 1990s, SUVs transitioned into alternatives to station wagons, leading to a decline in demand for two-door SUVs. After the 1994 model year, Mazda withdrew the Navajo, returning in 2000 with the four-door Tribute (a counterpart of the Ford Escape).

=== Mercury Mountaineer ===

The Ford Explorer was sold by the Mercury division as the Mercury Mountaineer from 1997 until 2010. Developed as a competitor for the Oldsmobile Bravada, the Mountaineer was a four-door SUV slotted above the Explorer Limited. Marking the reintroduction of the waterfall grille to the Mercury brand, the model line was distinguished by two-tone (and later monochromatic) styling different from the Explorer.

Coinciding with the 2010 closure of the Mercury brand, the Mountaineer was withdrawn after the 2010 model year; three generations were produced, with the Mountaineer serving as the largest Mercury SUV (above the Mariner).
=== Lincoln Aviator ===

The Explorer has been sold twice by the Lincoln division as the Lincoln Aviator. From 2003 through 2005, the Lincoln Aviator was marketed as a counterpart of the third-generation Explorer. The first mid-size SUV sold by Lincoln, the model line was slotted between the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator. Following the introduction of the fourth-generation Explorer, the model line was repackaged as a CUV based on the Ford Edge and renamed the Lincoln MKX (today the Lincoln Nautilus).

For 2020, the Lincoln Aviator was revived (after a 14-year hiatus) as a mid-size SUV; as before, the model line is a Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Explorer (now the sixth generation) and the Lincoln Navigator. The second-generation Aviator is the first Lincoln vehicle offered with plug-in hybrid capability as an option; its combined output is the highest-ever for a Lincoln vehicle.

== Export sales ==

===UK models===
In the UK, the Ford Explorer was initially available as just one model, with the 4.0 L engine and with a high specification – the only dealer options being a leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilized a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear tail lift that centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie-in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in dark green or silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats, and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black.

===Middle East and Asia===
In Korea, the Middle East, Taiwan, and China, the 2012 Ford Explorer was available in several trims, all with a 3.5 L V6 engine and an automatic gearbox. Some GCC markets offer the front-wheel-drive version as a base model, while most of the trims have standard all-wheel-drive. The latest generation Explorer was made available in Japan the Fall of 2015.

===Exports===
As of 2009, the Explorer is also sold in Bolivia, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Japan, South Korea, Israel, the Republic of China (Taiwan), The Philippines, Russia, Iceland, Germany, the Middle East, and certain countries in South America and Africa.

As of 2014, the Explorer is also available in Ukraine and Belarus. As of 2018, American-made Explorers are also exported to Vietnam.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Rollover and Firestone Tire controversy===

240 deaths and 3,000 catastrophic injuries resulted from the combination of early-generation Explorers and Firestone tires. The tire tread separated and the vehicle had an unusually high rate of rollover crash as a result. Both companies&#x27; reputations were tarnished. This event led to a disruption in the 90-year-old Ford/Firestone partnership.

Rollover risk is inherently higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as a modification for bulky 4-wheel-drive hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising the center of gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability. The previous Bronco II had already been cited by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; for rollover tendencies in turns.

The Explorer was cleared by the NHTSA as no more dangerous than any other truck when driven unsafely. It used the same tires as the Ford Ranger with a relatively low rating for high temperatures. Lowering tire pressure recommendations softened the ride further and improved emergency stability through increased traction, but increased the chances of overheating tires. A 1995 redesign with a new suspension slightly raised the Explorer&#x27;s center of gravity, but it was called inconsequential by a Ford spokesman. Memos by Ford engineers suggested lowering the engine height, but it would have increased the cost of the new design.

Explorer rollover rates, at the time of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors. While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires and was the initial cause of loss of control on many Ford Explorer Firestone tire tread separation rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle.

In May 2000, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) contacted Ford and Firestone about a higher-than-normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, Mercury Mountaineers, and Mazda Navajos fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved &quot;tread separation&quot;, in which the outer tread carcass would delaminate and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of Firestone tires (&quot;ATX&quot;, &quot;ATX II&quot;, and &quot;Wilderness AT&quot;) had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone&#x27;s Decatur, Illinois plant.

Ford recommended tire inflation of only likely contributing to the tread separation problem by causing the tires to operate at higher than normal temperatures.

Ford argued that Firestone was at fault, noting that the tires made by Firestone were very defective. Nevertheless, Ford subsequently recommended that front and rear tires should be inflated to on all Explorer models and mailed a replacement tire pressure door sticker indicating the same to all registered owners.

Some have argued that poor driver reaction to tire blowouts was a contributing factor. When a tire blew, the vehicle would experience a sudden sharp jerk, and many drivers reacted by counter-steering in an attempt to regain control. This action would cause a shift of the vehicle&#x27;s weight, resulting in a rollover especially at higher speeds (many reports of rollovers were of vehicles being driven at speeds of and above). In a test simulating dozens of tire blowouts, Larry Webster, a test-driver for &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine, was repeatedly able to bring a 1994 Explorer to a stop without incident from speeds of . According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, car experts and NHTSA claim that the vast majority of crash accidents and deaths were caused not by the vehicle, but by the driver, by road conditions or some combination of the two.

In response to Firestone&#x27;s allegations of the Explorer&#x27;s design defects, NHTSA undertook a preliminary investigation and reported that further action was not required. Its conclusion was that the Explorer was no more prone to rollover than other SUVs given their high center of gravity. Congress would pass the TREAD Act and the NHTSA would subsequently implement FMVSS 138. The subsequent introduction and proliferation of electronic stability control systems, along with lowering the vehicle, widening the track, and introducing independent rear suspension, have essentially addressed and mitigated this shortcoming.

In May 2001, Ford announced it would replace 13 million Firestone tires fitted to Explorer vehicles.

===U-Haul trailers===
On December 22, 2003, U-Haul, the largest American equipment rental company, announced it would prohibit its outlets from renting trailers to persons planning to tow behind Ford Explorers due to liability concerns, with no published data to substantiate the claim. Unofficial reports from employees indicated that it was due to the rear bumper separating from the vehicle, including the tow hook assembly. U-Haul did not alter its policies regarding the renting of trailers to persons planning to tow behind the Mercury Mountaineer, Mazda Navajo or earlier versions of the Lincoln Aviator, which are all mechanically identical to the Ford Explorer. In mid-2013, U-Haul began allowing Ford Explorers of model year 2011 and newer to tow their trailers. All other Ford Motor Company vehicles are allowed to tow U-Haul trailers.

===Reliability===
====Timing Chain====
The 4.0 L SOHC V6 engine found on second, third, and fourth generation Explorers was notorious for the plastic OEM timing chain guides, cassettes, and tensioners breaking resulting in timing chain ticking, rattle or &quot;death rattle&quot;. This problem can occur as early as 45,000 mi (72,000 km) in some vehicles. When the engine is running for an extended period of time with this issue, the engine can jump timing or cease running, damaging the heads and valves.

Timing chain rattle was mitigated in later years of the SOHC (in most vehicles, after 2002) with updated cassettes and tensioners.

====Transmission====
The 5R55 series transmissions found on second through fourth-generation Explorers were also notorious for premature failures. Common issues with this transmission include but are not limited to solenoid pack failure, harsh gear engagement, servo pin bore wear, premature transmission case wear, and excessive valve body wear.

====Water pump====
Water pumps on 2011 through 2019 Ford Explorer and 2013 through 2019 Ford Police Interceptor Utility equipped with the 3.5 L V6, 3.5 L EcoBoost V6, and 3.7 L V6 have a tendency to fail and potentially ruin the engine when they do. The water pumps on these engines are internally mounted and driven by the timing chain. As a result, when they fail, antifreeze is dumped directly into the crankcase; mixing with engine oil and potentially damaging the head gaskets and connecting rod bearings. Many of these water pump failures occur without warning and repairs often cost thousands of dollars as the engine needs to be disassembled or removed from the vehicle to access the water pump. In some cases, the engine will need to be replaced outright. A class-action lawsuit was started against Ford as a result of this issue. In 2020 the class-action lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by a judge stating the plaintiffs failed to present any arguments that Ford knew or should have known the water pumps were defective.

====4WD Transfer Case / Power Takeoff Unit (PTU)====
The 2011 through 2019 Explorer and Police Interceptor Utility models equipped with 4WD may experience severe issues with the four wheel drive system. Due to the transfer case/power takeoff unit&#x27;s close proximity to other high-heat components such as the exhaust manifold and transmission, along well as its small fluid capacity (about 0.5 U.S. quarts), it may be subject to repeated overheating resulting in internal bearing wear and premature failure. Common symptoms of a failed PTU include grinding or whining noises coming from under the vehicle, a natural-gas or oil type odor emitting from the engine bay, fluid leaks, and in severe instances, the vehicle will not move. Ford has made several design revisions to the PTU over the years to combat failure, including the addition of a fluid drain plug, temperature sensor, an external oil cooler (on select models), and revisions to the internal idler bearing.

===2024 recall===
In January 2024, Ford began the process of urging a recall of nearly 1.9 million Explorer SUVs between the 2011 and 2019 model years amid reports that trim pieces of vehicles could fly off. The recalls warnings are set to be issued to owners of these vehicles starting March 13, 2024.

<text>The Board of Trade is a British government body concerned with commerce and industry, currently within the Department for Business and Trade. Its full title is The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations, but is commonly known as the Board of Trade, and formerly known as the Lords of Trade and Plantations or Lords of Trade, and it has been a committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. The board has gone through several evolutions, beginning with extensive involvement in colonial matters in the 17th century, to powerful regulatory functions in the Victorian Era and early 20th century. It was virtually dormant in the last third of the 20th century. In 2017, it was revitalised as an advisory board headed by the International Trade Secretary who has nominally held the title of President of the Board of Trade, and who at present is the only privy counsellor of the board, the other members of the present board filling roles as advisors.

==Overview==

The board was first established as a temporary committee of England&#x27;s Privy Council to advise on colonial (plantation) questions in the early 17th century, when these settlements were initially forming. The board would evolve gradually into a government department with considerable power and a diverse range of functions, including regulation of domestic and foreign commerce, the development, implementation and interpretation of the Acts of Trade and Navigation, and the review and acceptance of legislation passed in the colonies. Between 1696 and 1782 the Board of Trade, in partnership with the various secretaries of state over that time, held responsibility for colonial affairs, particularly in British America. The newly created office of Home Secretary then held colonial responsibility until 1801, when the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies was established. Between 1768 and 1782 while with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, whose secretaryship was held jointly with the presidency of the Board of Trade, the latter position remained largely vacant; this led to a diminished status of the board and it became an adjunct to the new department and ministry concerns. Following the loss of the American War of Independence, both the board and the short-lived secretaryship were dismissed by the king on 2 May 1782 and the board was abolished later by the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 (22 Geo. 3. c. 82).

Following the Treaty of Paris 1783, with the continuing need to regulate trade between its remaining colonies, the independent United States and all other countries, a new Committee of Council on Trade and Plantations (later known as &#x27;the First Committee&#x27;) was established by William Pitt the Younger. Initially mandated by an Order in Council on 5 March 1784, the committee was reconstructed and strengthened by a second order, on 23 August 1786, under which it operated for the rest of its existence. The committee has been known as the Board of Trade since 1786, but this name was only officially adopted by an act of 1861. The new board&#x27;s first functions were consultative like earlier iterations, and its concern with plantations, in matters such as the approval of colonial laws, more successfully accomplished. As the Industrial Revolution expanded, the board&#x27;s work became increasingly executive and domestic. From the 1840s, a succession of acts of parliament gave it regulatory duties, notably concerning railways, merchant shipping and joint-stock companies.

This department was merged with the Ministry of Technology in 1970, to form the Department of Trade and Industry. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (from 2009 Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills) was also President of the Board of Trade. The full board has met only once since the mid-20th century, during commemorations of the bicentenary of the board in 1986. In 2016, the role of President of the Board of Trade was transferred to the Secretary of State for International Trade. The board was reconstituted in October 2017.

==History==
=== Origins ===
In 1622, at the end of the Dutch Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, King James I directed the Privy Council of England to establish a temporary committee to investigate the causes of various economic and supply problems, the decline in trade and consequent financial difficulties; detailed instructions and questions were given, with answers to be given &quot;as fast as the several points shall be duly considered by you.&quot; This would be followed by a number of temporary committees and councils to regulate the colonies and their commerce. The board&#x27;s formal title remains &quot;The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations&quot;.

In 1634, Charles I appointed a new commission for regulating plantations. It was headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury with its primary goals to increase royal authority and the influence of the Church of England in the colonies, particularly with the great influx of Puritans to the New World. Soon after, the English Civil Wars erupted and initiated a long period of political instability in England and the resultant loss of productivity for these committees. The war would spread to varying degrees to the English colonies, depending on the internal demographics and political and religious division of each. Between 1643 and 1648 the Long Parliament would establish a parliamentary Commission for Plantations to take the lead in colonial and commercial affairs. This period also saw the first regulation of royal tonnage and poundage and begin the modernization of customs and excise as growing sources of government revenue.

During the Interregnum and Commonwealth three acts of the Rump Parliament in 1650 and 1651 are notable in the historical development of England&#x27;s commercial and colonial programs. These include the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament on 1 August 1650. The instructions to the named commissioners, headed by Henry Vane the Younger, included consideration of both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufactures, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, as well as the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. The act&#x27;s statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions, along with an October act prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies and the Navigation Act of October 1651, formed the first definitive expression of England&#x27;s commercial policy. They represent the first attempt to establish a legitimate control of commercial and colonial affairs, and the instructions indicate the beginnings of a policy which had the prosperity and wealth of England exclusively at heart.

It was the Lords of Trade who, in 1675, originated the idea of transforming all of the colonies in America into Royal Colonies for the purpose of securing English trade against the French. They brought New Hampshire under the Crown, modified Penn&#x27;s charter, refused a charter to the Plymouth colony, and taking advantage of the concessions of the charters of Massachusetts and New York, created the Dominion of New England in 1685, thereby transforming all the territory from the Kennebec to the Delaware into a single crown colony.

In 1696, King William III appointed eight paid commissioners to promote trade in the American plantations and elsewhere. Staff appointed to serve the board in 1696 included a secretary, a deputy secretary, some clerks, office keepers, messengers, and a necessary woman; more staff such as a solicitor and a porter were added later. The Lords Commissioners of Trade and Foreign Plantations, commonly known as the Lords of Trade, did not constitute a committee of the Privy Council, but were, in fact, members of a separate body. The board carried on this work but also had long periods of inactivity, devolving into chaos after 1761 and dissolved in 1782 by an act of Parliament by the Rockingham Whigs.

=== Reestablishment 1784 ===
William Pitt the Younger re-established the committee in 1784, and an Order in Council of 23 August 1786 provided the formal basis that still remains in force. A secretariat was established which included the president, vice president and board members. By 1793, the board still remained in its old structure, with 20 members including the Archbishop of Canterbury. After 1820 the board ceased to meet regularly and the business was carried out entirely by the secretariat. The short name of &quot;Board of Trade&quot; was formalised in 1861.

In the 19th century the board had an advisory function on economic activity in the UK and its empire. During the second half of the 19th century it also dealt with legislation for patents, designs and trademarks, company regulation, labour and factories, merchant shipping, agriculture, transport, power etc. Colonial matters passed to the Colonial Office and other functions were devolved to newly created departments, a process that continued for much of the 20th century.

The original commission comprised the seven (later eight) Great Officers of State, who were not required to attend meetings, and the eight paid members, who were required to attend. The board, so constituted, had little real power, and matters related to trade and the colonies were usually within the jurisdiction of the secretaries of state and the Privy Council, with the board confining itself mainly to colonial administration.

===20th century reforms===

==== Lloyd George as President (1905–1908) ====

In 1905, David Lloyd George entered the new Liberal Cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman as President of the Board of Trade.

The first priority on taking office was the repeal of the 1902 Education Act. Lloyd George took the lead along with Augustine Birrell, President of the Board of Education. Lloyd George was the dominant figure on the committee drawing up the bill in its later stages and insisted that the bill create a separate education committee for Wales. The bill passed the House of Commons greatly amended but was completely mangled by the House of Lords. No compromise was possible and the bill was abandoned, allowing the 1902 Act to continue in effect. Nonconformists were bitterly upset by the failure of the Liberal Party to reform the 1902 Education Act, its most important promise to them, and over time their support for the Liberal Party slowly fell away.

According to Martin Roberts, Lloyd George headed a department of 750 experts that was responsible for supervising British industry, commerce and transportation. Using their pool of expertise, he initiated a series of reforms that were quickly endorsed by the Liberal Parliament. One of the first actions was the Census of Production Act 1906, which generated a Survey of production—an up-to-date compendium of detailed statistics necessary for regulating specific industries. In 1906, the Merchant Shipping Act upgraded the minimum working conditions, and the safety protections for both British sailors, and crews of foreign ships that used British ports. In 1907, the Patents and Design Act gave financial protection to British designs to stop unfair foreign copies. In the long term, his most important innovation was creating the Port of London Authority in 1908. It merged numerous inefficient and overlapping private companies and gave unified supervision to Britain&#x27;s most important port. That enabled London to compete more effectively with Hamburg and Rotterdam.

Lloyd George also turned his attention to strikes and industrial disputes in shipyards. He was instrumental in settling the serious threat of a national railway strike in 1907. While almost all the rail companies refused to recognise the unions, he persuaded them to recognise elected representatives of the workers who sat with the company representatives on conciliation boards—one for each company. If those boards failed to agree then an arbitrator would be called upon.

====Churchill as President 1908–1910====

H. H. Asquith succeeded the terminally ill prime minister on 8 April 1908 and, four days later, Winston Churchill was appointed President of the Board of Trade, succeeding Lloyd George who became Chancellor of the Exchequer. He continued the reform impulse Lloyd George had launched. One of Churchill&#x27;s first tasks was to arbitrate in an industrial dispute among ship-workers and employers on the River Tyne. He afterwards established a Standing Court of Arbitration to deal with future industrial disputes, establishing a reputation as a conciliator. In Cabinet, he worked with Lloyd George to champion social reform. He promoted what he called a &quot;network of State intervention and regulation&quot; akin to that in Germany. 

Churchill&#x27;s main achievements came in 1909. First was the Labour Exchanges Bill. It set up over 200 labour exchanges with William Beveridge in charge. The unemployed would come in and be assisted in finding employment. He also promoted the idea of an unemployment insurance scheme, which would be part-funded by the state. Secondly he introduced the Trade Boards Bill, creating trade boards which investigated the sweated trades and enabled the prosecution of exploitative employers. Passing with a large majority, it established the principle of a minimum wage and the right of workers to have meal breaks. Churchill introduced the Mines Eight Hours Bill, which legally prohibited miners from working more than an eight-hour day.

Sydney Buxton served as president between 1910 and 1914. His main role was passage of numerous specific trade and commerce laws.

===Since 1973===

From 1973, international trade policy of the United Kingdom was a competence of the European Economic Community, and later of the European Union. The board was reconstituted in October 2017, after the UK had voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. In its most recent iteration in 2017, only privy counsellors can be actual members of the board, while others are appointed as advisers.

<text>The EyeToy is a color webcam for use with the PlayStation 2. Supported games use computer vision and gesture recognition to process images taken by the EyeToy. This allows players to interact with the games using motion, color detection, and also sound, through its built-in microphone. It was released in 2003 and in total, it has 6 million sales.

The camera was manufactured by Logitech, although newer EyeToys were manufactured by Namtai. The camera is mainly used for playing EyeToy games developed by Sony and other companies. It is not intended for use as a normal PC camera, although some programmers have written unofficial drivers for it. The EyeToy is compatible with the PlayStation 3 and can be used for video chatting. As of November 6, 2008, the EyeToy has sold 10.5 million units worldwide.

==History==
The EyeToy was conceived by Richard Marks in 1999, after witnessing a demonstration of the PlayStation 2 at the 1999 Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California. Marks&#x27; idea was to enable natural user interface and mixed reality video game applications using an inexpensive webcam, using the computational power of the PlayStation 2 to implement computer vision and gesture recognition technologies. He joined Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) that year, and worked on the technology as Special Projects Manager for Research and Development.

Marks&#x27; work drew the attention of Phil Harrison, then Vice President of Third Party Relations and Research and Development at SCEA. Soon after being promoted to Senior Vice President of Product Development at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) in 2000, Harrison brought Marks to the division&#x27;s headquarters in London to demonstrate the technology to a number of developers. At the demonstration, Marks was joined with Ron Festejo of Psygnosis (which would later merge to become London Studio) to begin developing a software title using the technology, which would later become &quot;&quot;. Originally called the iToy (short for &quot;interactive toy&quot;) by the London branch, the webcam was later renamed to the EyeToy by Harrison. It was first demonstrated to the public at the PlayStation Experience event in August 2002 with four minigames.

Already planned for release in Europe, the EyeToy was picked by SCE&#x27;s Japanese and American branches after the successful showing at the PlayStation Experience. In 2003, EyeToy was released in a bundle with &quot;EyeToy: Play&quot;: in Europe on July 4, and in North America on November 4. By the end of the year, the EyeToy sold over 2 million units in Europe and 400,000 units in the United States. On February 11, 2004, the EyeToy was released in Japan.

==Design==
The camera is mounted on a pivot, allowing for positioning. Focusing the camera is performed by rotating a ring around the lens. It comes with two LED lights on the front. A blue light turns on when the PS2 is on, indicating that it is ready to be used, while the red light flashes when there is insufficient light in the room. It also contains a built-in microphone. 

The original logo and product design for the camera was designed by Sony employee Oliver Wright. A second, newer model of the EyeToy was also made, but sports a smaller size and silver casing. Apart from smaller electronics, no internal improvements had been made to the new model, and its functionality stayed the same as the old EyeToy.

==Use with personal computers==
Since the EyeToy is essentially a webcam inside a casing designed to match the PlayStation 2 and it uses a USB 1.1 protocol and USB plug, it is possible to make it work on other systems relatively easily. Drivers have been created to make it work with many computer operating systems, however, Linux is the only OS that has drivers installed yet no official drivers have been offered by Namtai, Logitech, or Sony for Microsoft Windows, macOS, or Linux. The type of driver required depends on the model of the EyeToy camera. There are three different models:

*SLEH-00030
*SLEH-00031
*SCEH-0004

The model information is included in a label on the bottom of the camera.

In these custom drivers, the red LED that normally signals inadequate lighting is used as the active recording indicator. The blue LED is lit when the EyeToy is plugged into the computer.

<text>Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a heated drink consisting of shaved or melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. It is often garnished with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.

The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created at least 5,300 years ago, starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador, and later consumed by the Maya around 2,500–3,000 years ago. A cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD. The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.

Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced of Latin America, the very thick served in Italy and served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.

==History==

Archaeologists have found evidence that Mayan chocolate consumption occurred as early as 500 BC, and there is speculation that chocolate predates even the Mayans. To make the chocolate drink, which was served cold, the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed it with water, cornmeal, chili peppers, and other ingredients. They then poured the drink back and forth from a cup to a pot until a thick foam developed. Chocolate was available to Maya of all social classes, although the wealthy drank chocolate from &quot;large spouted vessels&quot; that were often buried with elites. An early Classic period (460-480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site of Rio Azul, Guatemala, had vessels with the Maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink.

Because sugar was yet to come to the Americas, chocolate was said to be an acquired taste. Chocolate was then a drink consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold. The drink tasted spicy and bitter as opposed to sweetened modern hot chocolate, and José de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described chocolate as:

Loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant taste. Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians, where with they feast noble men who pass through their country. The Spaniards, both men and women, that are accustomed to the country, are very greedy of this Chocolate. They say they make diverse sorts of it, some hot, some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that &quot;chili&quot;; yea, they make paste thereof, the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh. Within Mesoamerica many drinks were made from cacao beans, and further enhanced by flowers like vanilla to add flavor. This was a tribute to the Aztecs. The Aztecs, or Mexica, required conquered people to provide them with chocolate. Cups, gourds, cacao beans, as well as other things they acquired were listed in The Essential Codex Mendoza. Cacao became used as a currency throughout Mesoamerica. The Aztecs used chocolate to show high status: it was a bad omen for someone low or common to drink chocolate. 

===European adaptation===
Europeans&#x27; first recorded contact with chocolate was not until 1502 on Columbus&#x27;s fourth voyage. After its introduction to Europe, the drink slowly gained popularity. The imperial court of Emperor Charles V soon adopted the drink, and chocolate became a fashionable drink popular with the Spanish upper class. Additionally, cocoa was given as a dowry when members of the Spanish royal family married other European aristocrats. At the time, chocolate was very expensive in Europe because the cocoa beans only grew in South America.

Sweet-tasting hot chocolate was then invented, leading hot chocolate to become a luxury item among the European nobility by the 17th century. Even when the first Chocolate House (an establishment similar to a modern coffee shop) opened in 1657, chocolate was still very expensive, costing 50 to 75 pence (approximately 10–15 shillings) a pound (roughly £45–65 in 2016). At the time, hot chocolate was often mixed with spices for flavor; one notable recipe was hot chocolate &quot;infused with fresh jasmine flowers, amber, musk, vanilla and ambergris.&quot; In the late 17th century, Sir Hans Sloane, president of the Royal College of Physicians, visited Jamaica, where he was introduced to cocoa. He found it &#x27;nauseous&#x27; but by mixing it with milk made it more palatable. When Sloane returned to England, he brought the recipe with him, introducing milk chocolate to England. The aristocratic nature of the drink led to chocolate being referred to as &quot;the drink of the gods&quot; in 1797.

The Spanish began to use made of porcelain in place of the hollowed gourds used by the natives. They then further tinkered with the recipes by using spices such as cinnamon, black pepper, anise, and sesame. Many of these things were used to try to recreate the flavor of the native flowers which they could not easily acquire. Black pepper was used to replace chillies and &quot;mecaxochitl&quot;, cinnamon was used in place of &quot;orejuelas&quot;, sugar replaced honey.

In 1828, Coenraad Johannes van Houten developed the first cocoa powder producing machine in the Netherlands. The press separated the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds, leaving a purer chocolate powder behind. This powder was easier to stir into milk and water. By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was also possible to manufacture chocolate bars. The term&quot; chocolate&quot; then came to mean solid chocolate rather than hot chocolate, with the first chocolate bar being created in 1847.

According to tradition, the Italian version cioccolata calda was first born in Turin around 1560: to celebrate that the capital of the Duchy of Savoy was moved from Chambéry to Turin, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy asked for a new beverage, and so this thicker, creamy version was created.

==Terminology==

A distinction is sometimes made between &quot;hot cocoa&quot;, made from cocoa powder (ground cacao beans from which much of the cocoa butter has been removed), and &quot;hot chocolate&quot;, made directly from bar chocolate, which already contains cocoa, sugar, and cocoa butter. Thus, the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter, the absence of which makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate.

* &quot;Hot chocolate&quot; can be made with dark, semisweet, or bittersweet chocolate grated or chopped into small pieces and stirred into milk with the addition of sugar. 
* &quot;Cocoa&quot; usually refers to a drink made with cocoa powder, hot milk or water, and sweetened to taste with sugar (or not sweetened at all). 
* &quot;Instant hot chocolate&quot; or &quot;hot cocoa mix&quot; may be based on cocoa powder, powdered chocolate, or both; often includes powdered milk or comparable ingredients so it can be made without using milk; sugar or other sweeteners; and typically stabilizers and thickeners. However, mixes can vary widely (between countries and often between brands) in ingredients included, their ratio and their quality.

==Add-ons==
Whipped cream and marshmallows are frequently added to hot chocolate. Theobromine found in the cocoa solids is fat soluble. Cocoa beans contain significant amount of fats, but cocoa powder is usually defatted. However, adding fat to defatted cocoa powder will increase its bioavailability.

Rum is added to hot chocolate to make a Lumumba.

==Usage==
Today, hot chocolate in the form of drinking chocolate or cocoa is considered a comfort food and is widely consumed in many parts of the world. European hot chocolate tends to be relatively thick and rich, while in the United States the thinner instant version is consumed more often. In Nigeria, hot chocolate is referred to as &quot;tea&quot; even though it is not actually a tea due to the Nigerian custom of referring to drinks consumed in the morning as &quot;tea&quot;. Many regions have distinctive additives or toppings, ranging from marshmallow and whipped cream to cheese.

===Europe===
In mainland Europe (particularly Spain and Italy), hot chocolate is sometimes served very thick due to the use of a thickening agent such as cornstarch. One of the thick forms of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian .

Hot chocolate with churros is a traditional breakfast in Spain. This style of hot chocolate can be extremely thick, often having the consistency of warm chocolate pudding. In the Netherlands, hot chocolate is a very popular drink, known as . It is often served at home or in cafes. In France, hot chocolate is often served at breakfast time. Sometimes sliced bread spread with butter, jam, honey, or Nutella is dunked into the hot chocolate.

In Germany, hot chocolate made by melted chocolate () is distinguished from those made from powders (). It is often served with whipped cream on top.

Even further variations of hot chocolate exist. In some cafes in Belgium and other areas in Europe, one who orders a or receives a cup of steaming white milk and a small bowl of bittersweet chocolate chips to dissolve in the milk. One Viennese variant, , contains an egg yolk for thickness.

===North America===

In the United States and Canada, the drink is popular in instant form, made with hot water or milk from a packet containing mostly cocoa powder, sugar, and dry milk. This is the thinner of the two main variations. It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows, whipped cream, or a piece of solid chocolate. Hot chocolate was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755. Traditionally, hot chocolate has been associated with cold weather and winter in the United States and Canada.

Hot chocolate mixed with espresso or coffee under the name of caffè mocha is sold in coffee shops around the United States and elsewhere. This particular name comes from the town Mocha, Yemen, where a specific blend of coffee with the same name is grown.

In Mexico, hot chocolate remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate of this type is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon hot chocolate as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as &quot;pan dulce&quot; or churros.

===South America===
In Colombia, a hot chocolate drink made with milk and water using a chocolatera and molinillo is enjoyed as part of breakfast with bread and soft, fresh farmer&#x27;s cheese. Colombian hot chocolate is often topped with a soft farmer&#x27;s cheese or other mild cheese. Similarly, hot chocolate in Ecuador is often topped with cheese.

In Peru, hot chocolate can be served with panettone at breakfast on Christmas Day, even though summer has already started in the southern hemisphere. In addition, many Peruvians will add a sweet chocolate syrup to their drink.

The Argentinian &quot;submarino&quot; is a hot chocolate drink made from adding a chocolate bar and sugar to hot steamed milk.

Also numerous documents reveal medicinal uses of cacao throughout Central and South America in which different components of the tree are still used today, in the late 20th and early 21st century, including cacao bark, fat, flowers, fruit pulp and leaves.

===Spanish East Indies===
In the Philippines, the native hot chocolate drink is known as &quot;tsokolate&quot;. It is made from &quot;tabliya&quot; (or ), tablets of pure ground roasted cacao beans, dissolved in water and milk. Like in Spanish and Latin American versions, the drink is traditionally made in a &quot;tsokolatera&quot; and briskly mixed with a wooden baton called the &quot;molinillo&quot; (also called or ), causing the drink to be characteristically frothy. is typically sweetened with a bit of &quot;muscovado&quot; sugar and has a distinctive grainy texture.

 is also known as in Kapampangan; in Maguindanao; and or in Visayan languages. All are derived from Spanish &quot;&quot; (&#x27;chocolate&#x27;).

 is commonly consumed at breakfast with traditional &quot;kakanin&quot; delicacies or &quot;pandesal&quot; and other types of bread. It is also popular during Christmas season in the Philippines.

<doc id="540366" wikidata="Q7355405" url="?curid=540366" title="Rockingham Whigs">
<text>The Rockingham Whigs (or Rockinghamites) in 18th-century British politics were a faction of the Whigs led by Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, from about 1762 until his death in 1782. The Rockingham Whigs briefly held power from 1765 to 1766 and again in 1782, and otherwise were usually in opposition to the various ministries of the period.

==History==
The faction came into existence in 1762, following the dismissal of the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s government and the dismissal of many of Newcastle&#x27;s supporters from their posts by his successor, Lord Bute, in the so-called &quot;Massacre of the Pelhamite Innocents&quot;.

For many years Newcastle and his late brother Henry Pelham had dominated parliament and government through their mastery of patronage and the &quot;old corruption&quot;, to the point where King George II had proved incapable of dispensing with their services even when he desired to. When the new king, George III, came to the throne in 1760, he was determined to reassert royal power and take the patronage mechanism away from Newcastle and his faction. After their fall from power Newcastle and his remaining loyalists came together to oppose Bute and assert what they believed to be Whig principles dating back to the political conflicts of the previous century. The faction was heavily dominated by wealthy aristocrats, and because of Newcastle&#x27;s advanced age, effective leadership soon came into the hands of the very wealthy young aristocrat the Marquess of Rockingham, who soon gave his name to the group.

Although the Rockingham Whigs were briefly brought into power in 1765, following the fall of the ministry of George Grenville, this ministry was based on an always uneasy relationship with the crown and collapsed a year later.

In fact, the faction showed less interest in holding office than in preventing a reassertion of royal power. They were prepared to unite with reformers of all kinds to preserve the constitutional settlement of 1689. But their essentially aristocratic and oligarchic character prevented them from collaborating with &quot;Country Party&quot; reformers advocating radical or populistic measures. They also opposed the British position which led to the American Revolution and sought reconciliation after it.

The writer and philosopher Edmund Burke, who served as Rockingham&#x27;s private secretary, was one of the faction&#x27;s leading spokesmen in the House of Commons.

They did not favor Irish constitutional goals but when out of power they used Irish problems to embarrass the government. During Rockingham&#x27;s government in 1765–66, his faction was generally hostile to the Irish Patriot Party, but during the administration of Lord North in 1770–82, it supported the Patriots&#x27; charges of mismanagement of Irish affairs. In power again in 1782, the Rockinghamites made concessions to the Patriots&#x27; demand for Irish legislative independence. They sought and failed to obtain a permanent solution that would have involved British control over external legislation and Irish control over internal affairs. They also failed to implement British party models in Ireland. Rockinghamites Charles James Fox and Burke were actively involved in Irish issues, says Powell, the former opportunistically and the latter with a genuine interest in reform.

In 1782 they joined forces with other members of the Opposition to bring down the North government which had overseen the American War since the beginning, and was blamed for the surrender of the British army at Yorktown. The new government was led by Rockingham and began to seek peace terms, laying the foundations for the Treaty of Paris agreed in 1783. Rockingham&#x27;s unexpected death in July 1782 led to a split in the new government with some Rockingham Whigs remaining in office under the new government of Lord Shelburne, and others going into opposition led by Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. After Rockingham&#x27;s death, the Duke of Portland became the head of the Rockingham Whig party.

<text>Adrenalin was an American rock band from East Detroit, Michigan, United States, best known for their song &quot;Road of the Gypsy,&quot; featured in the 1986 film &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;.

Adrenalin was made up of six friends from elementary school (St. Veronica) to high school (Grosse Pointe North). Brian and Mark Pastoria, Jimmy and Mike Romeo, Bruce Schafer and Mike &quot;Flash&quot; Haggerty started the band in the mid-1970s with the help of lead singer David Larson.

By the end of Adrenalin&#x27;s run as a band, the members had coped with the suicide of their original lead singer, David Larson. They were dropped by PolyGram in 1987. 

The Pastoria and Romeo brothers formed a new band titled &quot;DC Drive&quot;. With the addition of Doug Kahan on bass and Joey Bowen on vocals, DC Drive essentially replaced Adrenalin.

Soon after the forming of DC Drive they received a recording deal from Capitol Records/EMI of Canada and began working with Vini Poncia. The result was a self-titled album described by themselves as &quot;rock and soul&quot;.

The album and the single &quot;You Need Love&quot; were a success across Detroit and in Canada. In 1993, DC Drive and PR Music garnered many awards and much recognition, including seven nominations and four awards including Best Rock Group and Best Single (&quot;You Need Love&quot;) at the Motor City Music Awards. DC Drive disbanded in 1993, when Joey quit to make solo music and Doug went to Nashville.

Adrenalin re-united for a show at the Royal Oak Music Theatre on May 25, 2002 with singer Graham Strachan fronting the band.

In June 2015, Adrenalin was inducted into the Michigan Rock n Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

==Lineup==
Over the years the band&#x27;s lineup consisted of:
* David Larson - Vocals (1977–80)

<text>Portuguese creoles () are creole languages which have Portuguese as their substantial lexifier. The most widely-spoken creoles influenced by Portuguese are Cape Verdean Creole, Guinea-Bissau Creole and Papiamento.

== Origins ==
Portuguese overseas exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries led to the establishment of a Portuguese Empire with trading posts, forts and colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Contact between the Portuguese language and native languages gave rise to many Portuguese-based pidgins, used as linguas francas throughout the Portuguese sphere of influence. In time, many of these pidgins were nativized, becoming new stable creole languages.

As is the rule in most creoles, the lexicon of these languages can be traced to the parent languages, usually with predominance of Portuguese; 

These creoles are (or were) spoken mostly by communities of descendants of Portuguese, natives, and sometimes other peoples from the Portuguese colonial empire.

Until recently creoles were considered &quot;degenerate&quot; dialects of Portuguese unworthy of attention. As a consequence, there is little documentation on the details of their formation. Since the 20th century, increased study of creoles by linguists led to several theories being advanced. The monogenetic theory of pidgins assumes that some type of pidgin language — dubbed West African Pidgin Portuguese — based on Portuguese was spoken from the 15th to 18th centuries in the forts established by the Portuguese on the West African coast. According to this theory, this variety may have been the starting point of all the pidgin and creole languages. This may explain to some extent why Portuguese lexical items can be found in many creoles, but more importantly, it would account for the numerous grammatical similarities shared by such languages, such as the preposition &quot;na&quot;, meaning &quot;in&quot; and/or &quot;on&quot;, which would come from the Portuguese contraction &quot;na&quot;, meaning &quot;in the&quot; (feminine singular).

===Origin of the name===
The Portuguese word for &quot;creole&quot; is &quot;crioulo&quot;, which derives from the verb &quot;criar&quot; (&quot;to raise&quot;, &quot;to bring up&quot;) and a suffix &quot;-oulo&quot; of debated origin. Originally the word was used to distinguish the members of any ethnic group who were born and raised in the colonies from those who were born in their homeland. In Africa it was often applied to locally born people of (wholly or partly) Portuguese descent, as opposed to those born in Portugal; whereas in Brazil it was also used to distinguish locally born black people of African descent from those who had been brought from Africa as slaves.

In time, however, this generic sense was lost, and the word &quot;crioulo&quot; or its derivatives (like &quot;Creole&quot; and its equivalents in other languages) became the name of several specific Upper Guinean communities and their languages: the Guinean people and their Kriol language, Cape Verdean people and their Kriolu language, all of which still today have very vigorous use, suppressing the importance of official standard Portuguese.

==Africa==
===Upper Guinea===
The oldest Portuguese creole are the so-called &quot;crioulos&quot; of Upper Guinea, born around the Portuguese settlements along the northwest coast of Africa. Portuguese creoles are the mother tongues of most people in Cape Verde and the ABC Islands. In Guinea-Bissau, the creole is used as lingua franca among people speaking different languages, and is becoming the mother tongue of a growing population. They consist of two languages:

* Guinea-Bissau Creole (Kriol): lingua franca of Guinea-Bissau, also spoken in Casamance, Senegal and in Gambia.
** Casamance Creole (Kriyol): a dialect of Guinea-Bissau creole, spoken mainly in Casamance, Senegal and The Gambia.
* Cape Verdean Creole (Kriolu, Kriol): a dialect continuum on the islands of Cape Verde.
* Papiamento (Papiamentu), spoken in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao.

===Gulf of Guinea===
Another group of creoles is spoken in the Gulf of Guinea, in São Tomé and Príncipe and Equatorial Guinea.

* Angolar (Ngola, N&#x27;góla): in coastal areas of São Tomé Island.
* Annobonese (Fa d&#x27;Ambu): on Annobón Island.
* Forro: in São Tomé.
* Principense (Lunguyê) (almost extinct): on Príncipe Island.
* Tongas Portuguese (Português dos Tongas): variety of Cape Verdean Creole spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe.

Many other Portuguese creoles probably existed in the former Portuguese feitorias in the Gulf of Guinea, but also in the Congo region.

===Portuguese pidgins===
Portuguese pidgins still exist in Angola and Mozambique.

==South Asia==

===India===


The numerous Portuguese outposts in India and Sri Lanka gave rise to many Portuguese creole languages, of which only a few have survived to the present. The largest group were the Norteiro languages, spoken by the Norteiro people, the Christian Indo-Portuguese in the North Konkan. Those communities were centered on Baçaim, modern Vasai, which was then called the “Northern Court of Portuguese India” (in opposition to the &quot;Southern Court&quot; at Goa). The creole languages spoken in Baçaim, Salsete, Thana, Chevai, Mahim, Tecelaria, Dadar, Parel, Cavel, Bandora (modern Bandra), Gorai, Morol, Andheri, Versova, Malvan, Manori, Mazagão, and Chaul are now extinct. The only surviving Norteiro creoles are:

*Daman and Diu Portuguese Creole: in Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Spoken by about 4,000 people in Daman and 180 in Diu.
*Kristi: in Korlai, Maharashtra. Spoken by about 800 people in 2015.

These surviving Norteiro creoles have suffered drastic changes in the last decades. Standard Portuguese re-influenced the creole of Daman in the mid-20th century.

The creoles of the Coast of Coromandel, such as of Meliapor, Madras, Tuticorin, Cuddalore, Karikal, Pondicherry, Tranquebar, Manapar, and Negapatam, were already extinct by the 19th century. Their speakers (mostly the people of mixed Portuguese-Indian ancestry, known locally as Topasses) switched to English after the British takeover.

Most of the creoles of the Coast of Malabar, namely those of Cananor, Tellicherry, Mahé, Cochin (modern Kerala), and Quilon) had become extinct by the 19th century. In Cananor and Tellicherry, some elderly people still spoke some creole in the 1980s. The only creole that is still spoken (by a few Christian families only) is Vypin Indo-Portuguese, in the Vypin Island, near Kerala; the last native speaker of the language, William Rozario, died in 2010, but the language is still spoken and understood to some degree by the Luso-Asian community of Kochi.

Christians, even in Calcutta, used Portuguese until 1811. A Portuguese creole was still spoken in the early 20th century. Portuguese creoles were spoken in Bengal, such as at Balasore, Pipli, Chandannagore, Chittagong, Midnapore and Hooghly.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Significant Portuguese creoles flourished among the so-called Burgher and Kaffir communities of Sri Lanka:

*Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese: around Batticaloa and Trincomalee (Portuguese Burghers) and Puttalam (Kaffirs). Spoken by about 2,220 people in 2011. Primarily derived from Sinhala and Portuguese with influence and some vocabulary from Tamil and Dutch.
*Sri Lanka Kaffir Portuguese: a creole spoken by the Sri Lankan Kaffir community. The Kaffirs are descendants of soldiers and slaves from the African Great Lakes region, as well as Portuguese colonists and native Sinhalese and Tamils. The language reportedly differed from the main Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese Creole spoken in Sri Lanka, and likely had influences from Bantu languages, although there are no records of the language, and the Kaffir community switched to Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese.

=== Bangladesh ===
Bengali Portuguese Creole was spoken by Luso-Asians and Roman Catholics in Bangladesh until its extinction in the late 19th to early 20th century. Bangladeshi Luso-Asians who spoke Bengali Portuguese Creole were concentrated in Chittagong, in the old Portuguese settlement of Firingi Bazar, formerly the capital of the Portuguese Empire in Bengal. A smaller but still significant population of Bengali Portuguese Creole speakers was located in the smaller Firingi Bazar of Dhaka; the word Firingi is derived from the Persian word &quot;farang&quot; meaning foreigner.

In the past, Portuguese creoles were also spoken in Myanmar and Bangladesh.

==Southeast &amp; East Asia==
The earliest Portuguese creole in the region probably arose in the 16th century in Malacca, Malaysia, as well as in the Moluccas. After the takeover of those places by the Dutch in the 17th century, many creole-speaking slaves were taken to other places in Indonesia and South Africa, leading to several creoles that survived until recent times:

=== Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Timor-Leste ===
*Kristang (Cristão): in Malacca (Malaysia) and Singapore, with a further diaspora community in Perth, Western Australia descended from both communities arising in more modern times. Derived primarily from Portuguese and Malay with some vocabulary from Tamil, Cantonese, Dutch, and Hokkien.
*Mardijker (extinct in the 19th century): by the Mardijker people of Batavia (Jakarta) 
**Papiá Tugu (extinct in 1978): in Kampung Tugu, Jakarta, Indonesia.
*Portugis (extinct around 1950): in the Ambon, Ternate islands and Minahasa, Indonesia
*Bidau Portuguese (extinct in the 1960s): in the Bidau area of Dili, East Timor.
*Flores Portuguese (possibly extinct in the late 20th century): in the Larantuka and Maumere of Flores, Indonesia.

Portuguese was present on the island of Flores, Indonesia since the 16th century, especially in Larantuka and Maumere; it probably became extinct in the late 20th century, its traces in the local Malay-based creole language, if any, do not survive (see Larantuka Malay and Maumere Malay).

=== Thailand and Myanmar ===
Portuguese creoles were spoken in the Bangkok neighborhoods of Kudi Chin and Conception, which were former Portuguese colonies settled by Luso-Asians, and in the Sagaing Region of Myanmar. 

Thai Portuguese Creole was spoken by Luso-Asians in the Bangkok neighborhoods of Kudi Chin and Conception, which were former Portuguese colonies settled by Luso-Asians. The Luso-Thai communities of Kudi Chin and Conception still exist, numbering around 2,000, but the language has not been recorded for centuries.

In Myanmar, Burmese Portuguese Creole was spoken by the Bayingyi people, a Luso-Asian group descended from Portuguese mercenaries and adventurers to Burma in the 16th and 17th centuries who were enlisted into the Burmese army and settled there. The Bayingyi community still exists, but the language has not been recorded or spoken for centuries.

===Macau===
The Portuguese language was present in Portugal&#x27;s colony Macau since the mid-16th century. A Portuguese creole, Patuá, developed there. Macanese is primarily derived from Cantonese and Portuguese, with influence and vocabulary from Malay and Sinhala. It is nearly extinct in Macau, being spoken by an estimated 50 people in 2007, but more Macanese speakers likely exist among the diaspora.
*Macanese (Macaista, Patuá): in Macau and, to a lesser extent, in Hong Kong.

==South America==
A few Portuguese creoles are found in South America:
*Saramaccan of Suriname. 
*Cupópia of Brazil is nearly extinct.

There is no consensus regarding the position of Saramaccan, with some scholars classifying it as Portuguese creole with an English relexification. Saramaccan may be an English creole with Portuguese words, since structurally (morphology and syntax) it is related to the Surinamese creoles (Sranan, Ndyuka and Jamaican Maroon), despite the heavy percentage of Portuguese origin words. Other English creole languages of Suriname, such as Paramaccan or Kwinti, have also Portuguese influences.

Although sometimes classified as a creole, the Cupópia language from the Quilombo do Cafundó, at Salto de Pirapora, São Paulo, discovered in 1978 and spoken by less than 40 people as a secret language, is better classified as a Portuguese variety since it is structurally similar to Portuguese, in spite of having a large number of Bantu words in its lexicon. For languages with these characteristics, H. H. do Couto has forged the designation of anticreole, which would be the inverse of a creole language, as they are seen by the non-European input theories (i.e.: creoles = African languages grammar + European languages lexicon; anticreoles = European languages grammar + African languages lexicon).

There is a Portuguese dialect in Helvécia, South of Bahia that is theorized as presenting signs of an earlier decreolization. Ancient Portuguese creoles originating from Africa are still preserved in the ritual songs of the Afro-Brazilian animist religions (Candomblé).

===Brazil===
It has been conjectured that the vernacular of Brazil (not the official and standard Brazilian Portuguese) resulted from decreolization of a creole based on Portuguese and native languages; but this is not a widely accepted view. Vernacular Brazilian Portuguese is continuous and mutually intelligible with European Portuguese, and in fact quite conservative in some aspects.
Academic specialists compiled by linguist Volker Noll affirm that the Brazilian linguistic phenomena are the &quot;nativização&quot;, nativization/nativism of a most radically Romanic form. The phenomena in Brazilian Portuguese are Classical Latin and Old Portuguese heritage. This is not a creole form, but a radical Romanic form. Regardless of borrowings and minor changes, it must be kept in mind that Brazilian Portuguese is not a Portuguese creole, since both grammar and vocabulary remain &quot;real&quot; Portuguese and its origins can be traced directly from 16th century European Portuguese. Some authors, like Swedish Parkvall, classify it as a semicreole in the concept defined by Holm: a semicreole is a language that has undergone “partial restructuring, producing varieties which were never fully pidginized and which preserve a substantial part of their lexifier’s structure (...) while showing a noticeable degree of restructuring”. Nevertheless, scholars like Anthony Julius Naro and Maria Marta Pereira Scherre demonstrated how every single phenomenon found in Brazilian Portuguese can also be found in regional modern European Portuguese and 1500s and 1600s European Portuguese, such as the epic poetry of Luís de Camões, as well as other Romance languages such as Aranese Occitan, French, Italian and Romanian, classifying these phenomena as a natural Romance drift. Vernacular Brazilian Portuguese is continuous with European Portuguese and its phonetics is more conservative in several aspects, characterizing the nativization of a koiné formed by several regional European Portuguese variations brought to Brazil and its natural drift.

==The Caribbean==

Papiamento, spoken on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, is closely related to the Upper Guinea Creoles: Guinea-Bissau Creole, and especially with Cape Verdean Creole. Papiamento has a Portuguese basis, but has undergone a large Spanish and considerable Dutch influence.

== North America ==
Traces of a Portuguese-based pidgin have also been detected among the enslaved population in New Netherland.

<text>The Cheyenne River (; &quot;Good River&quot;), also written &quot;Chyone&quot;, referring to the Cheyenne people who once lived there, is a tributary of the Missouri River in the U.S. states of Wyoming and South Dakota. It is approximately 295 miles (475 km) long and drains an area of 24,240 square miles (62,800 km2). About 60% of the drainage basin is in South Dakota and almost all of the remainder is in Wyoming.

== Course ==
Formed by the confluence of Antelope Creek and Dry Fork Creek in Wyoming, it rises in northeastern Wyoming in the Thunder Basin National Grassland in Converse County. It flows east into South Dakota, passes Edgemont, and skirts the southern end of the Black Hills, passing through Angostura Reservoir. 
On the east side of the Black Hills, it flows northeast, past Oral, the Buffalo Gap National Grassland, and along the northwestern boundary of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and Badlands National Park. It is joined by Rapid Creek, passes Wasta and is joined by the Belle Fourche River in eastern Meade County, after which it flows ENE along the southern boundary of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Near the town of Cherry Creek, it is joined by Cherry Creek and flows into Missouri at Lake Oahe, approximately 32 mi (50 km) NNW of Pierre, South Dakota, with the lower 35 mi (56 km) of the river forming an arm of Lake Oahe.

The Belle Fourche River is the largest tributary of the Cheyenne. Rapid, Sulphur, Plum, Cherry, and Owl Creeks are important other tributaries of the Belle Fourche-Cheyenne. Snowmelt from the Black Hills provides the major source of river water. Because of the proximity to the Black Hills and its mining industry, the Cheyenne historically picked up large quantities of zinc, arsenic, and cyanide. Those pollutants are no longer a major threat due to water quality regulations. The Cheyenne River is still higher in dissolved mineral content than any other South Dakota major river.

== Cheyenne Watershed ==
The Cheyenne watershed is part of the Missouri River watershed and spans the Mountain West and Great Plains states of northeastern Wyoming, southwestern and south central South Dakota, as well as small areas of northwestern Nebraska, and southeastern Montana. As of 2001, the Cheyenne watershed was primarily grassland (62.8%), followed by shrubland (16.3%) and forest cover (11.9%). The primary population centers include Rapid City, South Dakota and Gillette, Wyoming.

With a population of nearly 4.5 million in these states, water use was an average of in 2010. This amounts to approximately per person per day. A total of are stored in 9 lakes and reservoirs in the Cheyenne watershed.

Sedimentation is a major water quality concern for the Cheyenne watershed, potentially resulting in reduced storage capacity for reservoirs. Major water issues in the Cheyenne, reflect those of the larger Missouri River basin and stem from anticipated effects from a warming climate.

==Industrial use==
Demand for water from agriculture for irrigation, greater threats to viable habitat for endangered species and wildlife are large concerns directly related to increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration. Water companies are also concerned about &quot;water delivery&quot; in response to shifting runoff periods. Similarly, power companies are concerned about climate effects on hydropower generation.

As of November 2019, TC Energy was applying for permits in the state to tap the Cheyenne River to use water for the construction of Phase 4 of the Keystone pipeline, including camp construction to house transient construction workers.

<doc id="540385" wikidata="Q830142" url="?curid=540385" title="Rhizobium">
<text>Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. &quot;Rhizobium&quot; species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of (primarily) legumes and other flowering plants.

The bacteria colonize plant cells to form root nodules, where they convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the enzyme nitrogenase. The ammonia is shared with the host plant in the form of organic nitrogenous compounds such as glutamine or ureides. The plant, in turn, provides the bacteria with organic compounds made by photosynthesis. This mutually beneficial relationship is true of all of the rhizobia, of which the genus &quot;Rhizobium&quot; is a typical example. &quot;Rhizobium&quot; is also capable of solubilizing phosphate.

==History==
Martinus Beijerinck was the first to isolate and cultivate a microorganism from the nodules of legumes in 1888. He named it &quot;Bacillus radicicola&quot;, which is now placed in &quot;Bergey&#x27;s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology&quot; under the genus &quot;Rhizobium&quot;.

==Research==
&quot;Rhizobium&quot; forms a symbiotic relationship with certain plants, such as legumes, fixing nitrogen from the air into ammonia, which acts as a natural fertilizer for the plants. The Agricultural Research Service is conducting research involving the genetic mapping of various rhizobial species with their respective symbiotic plant species, like alfalfa or soybean. The goal of this research is to increase the plants’ productivity without using fertilizers.

In molecular biology, &quot;Rhizobium&quot; has been identified as a contaminant of DNA extraction kit reagents and ultrapure water systems, which may lead to its erroneous appearance in microbiota or metagenomic datasets. The presence of nitrogen-fixing bacteria as contaminants may be due to the use of nitrogen gas in ultra-pure water production to inhibit microbial growth in storage tanks.

<doc id="540392" wikidata="Q5128328" url="?curid=540392" title="Classical general equilibrium model">
<text>The classical general equilibrium model aims to describe the economy by aggregating the behavior of individuals and firms. Note that the classical general equilibrium model is unrelated to classical economics, and was instead developed within neoclassical economics beginning in the late 19th century.

In the model, the individual is assumed to be the basic unit of analysis and these individuals, both workers and employers, will make choices that reflect their unique tastes, objectives, and preferences. It is assumed that individuals&#x27; wants typically exceed their ability to satisfy them (hence scarcity of goods and time). It is further assumed that individuals will eventually experience diminishing marginal utility. Finally, wages and prices are assumed to be elastic (they move up and down freely). The classical model assumes that traditional supply and demand analysis is the best approach to understanding the labor market. The functions that follow are aggregate functions that can be thought of as the summation of all the individual participants in the market.

==Aggregate supply==

==Labor demand==
The consumers of the labor market are firms. The demand for labor services is a derived demand, derived from the supply and demand for the firm&#x27;s products in the goods market. It is assumed that a firm&#x27;s objective is to maximize profit given the demand for its products, and given the production technology that is available to it.

Some notation:
 Let formula_1 be price level of commodities
 Let formula_2 be nominal wage
 Let formula_3 be real wage (w/p)
 Let formula_4 be profit of firms
 Let formula_5 be labor demand
 Let formula_6 be the firms output of commodities that it will supply to the goods market.

===Output function===
Let us specify this output (commodity supply) function as:
:formula_7
It is an increasing concave function with respect to LD because of the Diminishing Marginal Product of Labor. Note that in this simplified model, labour is the only factor of production. If we were analysing the goods market, this simplification could cause problems, but because we are looking at the labor market, this simplification is worthwhile.

===Firms&#x27; profit function===
Generally a firm&#x27;s profit is calculated as:
 profit = revenue - cost&lt;br&gt;
In &quot;nominal terms&quot; the profit function is:
 formula_8&lt;br&gt;
In &quot;real terms&quot; this becomes:
 formula_9

===Firms&#x27; optimal (profit maximizing) condition===
In an attempt to achieve an optimal situation, firms can maximize profits with this &quot;Maximized profit function&quot;:
 formula_10&lt;br&gt;
When functions are given, Labor Demand (LD) can be derived from this equation.

==Labour supply==
The suppliers of the labor market are households. A household can be thought of as the summation of all the individuals within the household. Each household offers an amount of labour services to the market. The supply of labour can be thought of as the summation of the labour services offered by all the households. The amount of service that each household offers depends on the consumption requirements of the household, and the individuals relative preference for consumption verses free time.

Some notation:
 Let U be total utility
 Let YD be commodity demand (consumption)
 Let LS be labor supply (hours worked)
 Let D(LS) be disutility from working, an increasing convex function with respect to LS.

===Households&#x27; consumption constraint===
Consumption constraint = profit income + wage income&lt;br&gt;
 formula_11

===Households&#x27; utility function===
total utility = utility from consumption - disutility from work &lt;br&gt;
formula_12&lt;br&gt;
substitute consumption: &lt;br&gt;
formula_13

===Households&#x27; optimal condition===
Maximized utility function: &lt;br&gt;
formula_14&lt;br&gt;
When functions are given, Labor Supply (LS) can be derived from this equation.

==Aggregate demand==
Y = C + I + G
whereby Y is output, C is consumption, I is investment and G is government spending

<doc id="540396" wikidata="Q6950605" url="?curid=540396" title="Ariane flight V88">
<text>Ariane flight V88 was the failed maiden flight of the Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket, vehicle no. 501, on 4 June 1996. It carried the Cluster spacecraft, a constellation of four European Space Agency research satellites. 

The launch ended in failure due to multiple errors in the software design: dead code, intended only for Ariane 4, with inadequate protection against integer overflow led to an exception handled inappropriately, halting the whole otherwise unaffected inertial navigation system. This caused the rocket to veer off its flight path 37 seconds after launch, beginning to disintegrate under high aerodynamic forces, and finally self-destructing via its automated flight termination system. The failure has become known as one of the most infamous and expensive software bugs in history. The failure resulted in a loss of more than US$370 million.

==Launch failure==

The Ariane 5 reused the code from the inertial reference platform from the Ariane 4, but the early part of the Ariane 5&#x27;s flight path differed from the Ariane 4 in having higher horizontal velocity values. This caused an internal value BH (Horizontal Bias) calculated in the alignment function to be unexpectedly high. The alignment function was operative for approximately 40 seconds of flight, which was based on a requirement of Ariane 4, but served no purpose after lift-off on the Ariane 5. The greater values of BH caused a data conversion from a 64-bit floating point number to a 16-bit signed integer value to overflow and cause a hardware exception. The programmers had protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow to keep within a required maximum workload target of 80% for the on-board Inertial Reference System computer, and relied on assumptions which were correct for the trajectory of Ariane 4, but not Ariane 5, regarding the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables. The exception halted both of the inertial reference system modules, although they were intended to be redundant. The active module presented a diagnostic bit pattern to the On-Board Computer which was interpreted as flight data, in particular causing full nozzle deflections of the solid boosters and the Vulcain main engine. This led to an angle of attack of more than 20 degrees, causing separation of the boosters from the main stage, the triggering of the self-destruct system of the launcher, and the destruction of the flight.

The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that &quot;An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment.&quot;

Other issues identified in the report focused on testing:
* The purpose of the review process, which involves all major partners in the Ariane 5 programme, is to validate design decisions and to obtain flight qualification. In this process, the limitations of the alignment software were not fully analysed and the possible implications of allowing it to continue to function during flight were not realised.
* The specification of the inertial reference system and the tests performed at equipment level did not specifically include the Ariane 5 trajectory data. Consequently, the realignment function was not tested under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions, and the design error was not discovered.
* It would have been technically feasible to include almost the entire inertial reference system in the overall system simulations which were performed. For a number of reasons it was decided to use the simulated output of the inertial reference system, not the real system or its detailed simulation. Had the system been included, the failure could have been detected. Post-flight simulations have been carried out on a computer with software of the inertial reference system and with a simulated environment, including the actual trajectory data from the Ariane 501 flight. These simulations have faithfully reproduced the chain of events leading to the failure of the inertial reference systems.

Another perspective of the failure, based on systems engineering, focuses on requirements:
* The ranges of variables such as horizontal velocity and the quantity BH computed from it should have been explicitly quantified. Instead, a 16-bit range was assumed.
* The alignment task should have been deactivated at an appropriate moment. Instead, the alignment task was running after lift-off.
* A failure model of the inertial reference platforms should have been analyzed to ensure that service would be continuously delivered throughout the flight, rather than assuming that at most one module would fail. Instead, both modules failed, and rather than killing the flight gracefully, output diagnostic messages were interpreted as flight data.

==Payload==
Cluster consisted of four cylindrical, spin-stabilised spacecraft, powered by 224 watt solar cells. The spacecraft were to have flown in a tetrahedral formation, and were intended to conduct research into the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. The satellites would have been placed into highly elliptical orbits; , inclined at 90 degrees to the equator.

==Aftermath==
Following the failure, four replacement Cluster II satellites were built. These were launched in pairs aboard Soyuz-U/Fregat rockets in 2000.

The launch failure brought the high risks associated with complex computing systems to the attention of the general public, politicians, and executives, resulting in increased support for research on ensuring the reliability of safety-critical systems. The subsequent automated analysis of the Ariane code (written in Ada) was the first example of large-scale static code analysis by abstract interpretation.

The failure also harmed the excellent success record of the European Space Agency&#x27;s rocket family, set by the high success rate of the Ariane 4 model. It was not until 2007 that Ariane 5 launches were recognised as being as reliable as those of the predecessor model.

<text>The Social Market Foundation (SMF) is an independent British political public policy think-tank based in Westminster, London. It is one of the &#x27;Top 12 Think Tanks in Britain&#x27; and was named &#x27;UK Think Tank of the Year&#x27; by Prospect in 2012. Its purpose is to &quot;advance the education of the public in the economic, social and political sciences&quot; and to &quot;champion ideas that marry a pro-market orientation with concern for social justice&quot;. Policy ideas are based on the concept of the social market economy.

== History ==
Founded in 1989, the organisation was established by individuals close to David Owen&#x27;s &#x27;continuing&#x27; Social Democratic Party, which had itself been formed the year beforehand by those members of the original SDP who refused to accept that party&#x27;s merger with the Liberals. Owen had made much use of the term &#x27;social market&#x27; when describing the economic model he espoused as an alternative to Thatcherism, and upon the Foundation&#x27;s establishment he was made one of its trustees. The Foundation&#x27;s first executive director was the &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP peer Lord Kilmarnock, and its chairman from 1991 was Robert Skidelsky, Professor of Political Economy at Warwick University, who was responsible for much of the Owenite SDP&#x27;s economic policy, having written a green paper on the social market economy for the party&#x27;s first conference in September 1988.

Following the demise of the &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP in 1990, the Foundation gravitated to the post-Thatcher Conservative Party, and in press circles it was often cited as &quot;John Major&#x27;s favourite thinktank&quot;. Skidelsky himself joined the Conservatives in 1992, shortly after being made a life peer by the government, while two directors, Rick Nye and Daniel Finkelstein, both former SDP activists and political advisers to David Owen, later left the Foundation to work for the Conservative Research Department.

In the late 1990s the Foundation moved closer to New Labour, with Gordon Brown giving a speech about &#x27;social markets&#x27; at the Foundation in 2003, and SMF publishing a paper by Gordon Brown in 2004. In 2001, Lord Skidelsky was replaced as chair by David, Lord Lipsey, who in the 1970s had been a special adviser to the Labour politician Anthony Crosland. The Foundation was thus associated with some of the policies of New Labour, particularly issues of public service reform.

In September 2010 Mary Ann Sieghart, the political and social affairs journalist, took over as Chair.

== Policy goals ==

The SMF’s remit is to focus on domestic public policy, particularly the public services and welfare. The majority of publications are therefore focused on issues concerning education, health care and employment. However it also produces publications on wide-ranging subjects such as road-pricing, casinos and energy policy.

The SMF has a 20 member Policy Advisory Board, which as of 2018 included the Members of Parliament (MPs) Stephen Kinnock, Norman Lamb, Chris Leslie, Alison McGovern, Tom Tugendhat, Chuka Umunna and John Woodcock.

== Funding ==
In November 2022, the funding transparency website Who Funds You? gave The Social Market Foundation a B grade (rating goes from A to E).

<doc id="540420" wikidata="Q696483" url="?curid=540420" title="Nakajima B6N">
<text>The was the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s standard carrier-borne torpedo bomber during the final years of World War II and the successor to the B5N &quot;Kate&quot;. Due to its protracted development, a shortage of experienced pilots and the United States Navy&#x27;s achievement of air superiority by the time of its introduction, the B6N was never able to fully demonstrate its combat potential.

==Design and development==

The B5N carrier-based torpedo bomber&#x27;s weaknesses had shown themselves early in the Second Sino-Japanese War; as well as updating that aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy began seeking a faster, longer-ranged replacement. In December 1939 it issued a specification to Nakajima for a Navy Experimental &quot;14-Shi&quot; Carrier Attack Aircraft capable of carrying the same external weapons load as the B5N. The new plane was to carry a crew of three (pilot, navigator/bombardier and radio operator/gunner) and be of low wing, cantilevered, all-metal construction (though control surfaces were fabric-covered). Further requirements included a top speed of , a cruising speed of and a range of with an bomb load or without external armament.

The Navy had requested installation of the proven Mitsubishi &quot;Kasei&quot; engine as the B6N&#x27;s powerplant but Engineer Kenichi Matsumara insisted on using Nakajima&#x27;s new &quot;Mamoru&quot; 11 14-cylinder air-cooled radial due to its lower fuel consumption and greater adaptability. This became an unfortunate choice as the Mamoru engine was plagued with mechanical defects and never achieved its expected power rating.

Constrained by the standard-sized aircraft elevators then in use on most Japanese carriers, designer Matsumara was obliged to use a wing similar in span and area as that of the B5N and to limit the aircraft&#x27;s overall length to . This latter restriction accounted for the B6N&#x27;s distinctive swept-forward tail fin and rudder. The outer wing panels folded upward hydraulically, reducing the B6N&#x27;s overall span from to approximately for minimal carrier stowage. In order to lessen increased wingloading due to the heavier powerplant, Fowler flaps were installed which could be extended beyond the wing&#x27;s trailing edge. These were normally lowered to an angle of 20 degrees during take-off and 38 degrees when landing. Despite the use of these flaps, however, the B6N had a much higher stall speed than its predecessor.

The prototype B6N1 made its maiden flight on 14 March 1941. Following continued testing, however, several problems became evident. In particular, the aircraft exhibited an alarming tendency to roll while in flight, the cause of which was traced to the extreme torque developed by the four-bladed propeller. To compensate, the aircraft&#x27;s tail fin was thinned down and moved 2 degrees ten minutes to port. This modification greatly improved the plane&#x27;s handling characteristics.

The B6N1&#x27;s &quot;Mamoru&quot; 11 engine was found prone to severe vibrations and overheating at certain speeds and was at first judged too unreliable, an important consideration given that the plane was expected to fly long distances over open water. Following a series of modifications, though, the engine&#x27;s performance was finally deemed promising enough that carrier acceptance trials were begun at the end of 1942. Subsequent test flights conducted aboard the carriers &quot;Ryuho&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; indicated the need to strengthen the tail hook mounting on the plane&#x27;s fuselage. Some attempts were also made to use RATOG (rocket-assisted take-off gear) units on several B6N1s in order to qualify the aircraft for use on smaller carriers but the results were unsatisfactory.

The B6N1 was officially approved for production status in early 1943 and given the designation Navy Carrier Attack Aircraft &quot;Tenzan&quot; Model 11. Modifications based on testing of the initial prototypes included: the addition of a flexible Type 92 machine gun in a ventral tunnel at the rear of the cockpit (in addition to the standard rear-firing Type 92), and a 7.7mm Type 97 machine-gun to the port wing (the latter was eventually deleted after the seventieth production aircraft); angling the torpedo mounting rack 2 degrees downward and adding torpedo stabilization plates to prevent the torpedo from bouncing off the water during low-altitude release; strengthening of the main landing gear. A proposal by the designers to replace the B6N1&#x27;s unprotected fuel tanks with self-sealing ones would have resulted in a 30% drop in fuel capacity, a loss in range the Navy decided was unacceptable.

After only 133 B6N1s had been produced by July 1943, the Japanese Ministry of Munitions ordered Nakajima to halt manufacture of the &quot;Mamoru 11&quot; engine in order that the Navy reduce the number of different engines then in use. Pending availability of the 18-cylinder Nakajima &quot;Homare&quot; engine, Nakajima was asked to substitute the Mitsubishi MK4T &quot;Kasei 25&quot; engine on the B6N1 airframe, the very engine the Navy had originally requested them to use. As the &quot;Mamoru 11&quot; and &quot;Kasei 25&quot; were similar in size, installation was relatively straightforward, requiring only that the nose be extended to maintain the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity and minor alterations to the oil cooler and air intakes on the engine cowling. A smaller diameter four-bladed propeller and shorter spinner were also installed at this time, resulting in a small weight-savings, and the retractable tailwheel was fixed permanently in the down position. Finally, the single exhaust stacks on either side of the engine cowling were replaced with multiple smaller stubs to reduce glare at night and to supply a minor amount of forward thrust. The resulting modification was designated Navy Carrier Attack Aircraft &quot;Tenzan&quot; Model 12 or B6N2.

Starting in the fall of 1943, one of every three B6N2s manufactured was equipped with 3-Shiki Type 3 air-to-surface radar for detecting enemy ships. Yagi antennas were installed along the wing leading edges and also protruded from the sides of the rear fuselage.

A final version of the aircraft, designated B6N3 Model 13, was planned for land-based use as, by this point in the war, all of Japan&#x27;s large carriers had been sunk and those few smaller ones remaining lacked catapults for launching heavier carrier-borne aircraft like the B6N. Changes included installation of a &quot;Kasei&quot; Model 25c engine, a more streamlined engine cowling and crew canopy, strengthening of the main landing gear, a retractable tail wheel and removal of the tail hook. Two B6N3 prototypes were completed but Japan surrendered before this variant could be put into production.

By war&#x27;s end in August 1945, Nakajima had completed a total of 1,268 B6Ns (almost all of them B6N2s) at its plants in Okawa in the Gumma district and at Aichi in the Handa district. Production never exceeded more than 90 planes per month.

==Operational history==
The B6N &quot;Tenzan&quot; began reaching front-line units in August 1943 in small numbers. The intent was to gradually replace all of the B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers then operating aboard the carriers of the Third Fleet at Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands. However, the B6Ns were prematurely committed to battle when increased Allied naval activity in the Solomon Islands indicated a likely invasion at Bougainville. In response to this threat, the IJN initiated Operation Ro. This involved reinforcing land-based air units at Rabaul with 173 carrier aircraft from First Carrier Division (&quot;Zuikaku&quot;, &quot;Shokaku&quot; and &quot;Zuiho&quot;), including forty B6Ns. These aircraft were flown from Truk to Rabaul between 28 October and 1 November.

On 5 November fourteen B6N1s, escorted by four A6M Zero fighters, were sent to attack American shipping anchored off Bougainville. Four B6N1s were lost and no hits were scored, returning Japanese pilots claimed to have sunk one large and one medium carrier, two heavy cruisers and two other cruisers or large destroyers.

Additional attacks on 8 November and 11 November, suffered heavy losses, with only 52 of the original 173 planes from the First Carrier Division making it back to Truk on 13 November, among them, just six B6N1 &quot;Tenzans&quot; out of the forty committed.
On 19 June 1944, the B6N made its carrier-borne combat debut at The Battle of the Philippine Sea, operating in an environment where the U.S. Navy had virtually complete air superiority. Subsequently, it failed to inflict any damage whilst taking heavy losses from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s new F6F Hellcat fighter.

By this point, small improvements in the B6N&#x27;s performance were amongst the least of the Japanese Navy&#x27;s problems. When the new model became available in mid-1944, Japan had already lost most of its large carriers and became desperately short of experienced pilots. Therefore, the vast majority of B6N2 operations took place from land bases and failed to achieve any major successes. The planes were extensively used in the Battle of Okinawa where they were also used for kamikaze missions for the first time.

<text>Jill is an English feminine given name, a short form of the name Gillian, which in turn originated as a Middle English variant of Juliana. Jill was such a common name that it had an everygirl quality, as in the 15th century English nursery rhyme Jack and Jill. By the 17th century, the name had become a term for a &quot;common street jade,&quot; implying promiscuous sexual behavior, and declined in usage in the Anglosphere. Usage of the name increased again in the 20th century. The name was most used in English-speaking countries from the 1930s to the 1970s. It is currently well-used in the Netherlands.

<text>Products are the species formed from chemical reactions. During a chemical reaction, reactants are transformed into products after passing through a high energy transition state. This process results in the consumption of the reactants. It can be a spontaneous reaction or mediated by catalysts which lower the energy of the transition state, and by solvents which provide the chemical environment necessary for the reaction to take place. When represented in chemical equations, products are by convention drawn on the right-hand side, even in the case of reversible reactions. The properties of products such as their energies help determine several characteristics of a chemical reaction, such as whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic. Additionally, the properties of a product can make it easier to extract and purify following a chemical reaction, especially if the product has a different state of matter than the reactants.

Spontaneous reaction
:formula_1
*Where R is reactant and P is product.

Catalysed reaction
:formula_2
*Where R is reactant, P is product and C is catalyst.
Much of chemistry research is focused on the synthesis and characterization of beneficial products, as well as the detection and removal of undesirable products. Synthetic chemists can be subdivided into research chemists who design new chemicals and pioneer new methods for synthesizing chemicals, as well as process chemists who scale up chemical production and make it safer, more environmentally sustainable, and more efficient. Other fields include natural product chemists who isolate products created by living organisms and then characterize and study these products.

==Determination of reaction==
The products of a chemical reaction influence several aspects of the reaction. If the products are lower in energy than the reactants, then the reaction will give off excess energy making it an exergonic reaction. Such reactions are thermodynamically favorable and tend to happen on their own. If the kinetics of the reaction are high enough, however, then the reaction may occur too slowly to be observed, or not even occur at all. This is the case with the conversion of diamond to lower energy graphite at atmospheric pressure, in such a reaction diamond is considered metastable and will not be observed converting into graphite.

If the products are higher in chemical energy than the reactants then the reaction will require energy to be performed and is therefore an endergonic reaction. Additionally if the product is less stable than a reactant, then Leffler&#x27;s assumption holds that the transition state will more closely resemble the product than the reactant. Sometimes the product will differ significantly enough from the reactant that it is easily purified following the reaction such as when a product is insoluble and precipitates out of solution while the reactants remained dissolved.

==History==
Ever since the mid-nineteenth century, chemists have been increasingly preoccupied with synthesizing chemical products. Disciplines focused on isolation and characterization of products, such as natural products chemists, remain important to the field, and the combination of their contributions alongside synthetic chemists has resulted in much of the framework through which chemistry is understood today.

Much of synthetic chemistry is concerned with the synthesis of new chemicals as occurs in the design and creation of new drugs, as well as the discovery of new synthetic techniques. Beginning in the early 2000s, process chemistry began emerging as a distinct field of synthetic chemistry focused on scaling up chemical synthesis to industrial levels, as well as finding ways to make these processes more efficient, safer, and environmentally responsible.

==Biochemistry==

In biochemistry, enzymes act as biological catalysts to convert substrate to product. For example, the products of the enzyme lactase are galactose and glucose, which are produced from the substrate lactose.

:formula_3
*Where S is substrate, P is product and E is enzyme.

===Product promiscuity===
Some enzymes display a form of promiscuity where they convert a single substrate into multiple different products. It occurs when the reaction occurs via a high energy transition state that can be resolved into a variety of different chemical products.

===Product inhibition===
Some enzymes are inhibited by the product of their reaction binds to the enzyme and reduces its activity. This can be important in the regulation of metabolism as a form of negative feedback controlling metabolic pathways. Product inhibition is also an important topic in biotechnology, as overcoming this effect can increase the yield of a product.

<doc id="540459" wikidata="Q7595066" url="?curid=540459" title="St Patrick's College, Dublin">
<text>St Patrick&#x27;s College (), often known as St Pat&#x27;s, was a third level institution in Ireland, the leading function of which was as the country&#x27;s largest primary teacher training college, which had at one time up to 2,000 students. Founded in Drumcondra, in the northern suburbs of Dublin, in 1875, with a Roman Catholic ethos, it offered a number of undergraduate courses, primarily in primary education and arts, and in time postgraduate courses too, mostly in education and languages.

On 30 September 2016, St Patrick&#x27;s was dissolved as an institution and incorporated into Dublin City University, along with Mater Dei Institute of Education, All Hallows College, and the Church of Ireland College of Education. The teacher training elements of those combined institutions currently form DCU&#x27;s fifth faculty, the &quot;DCU Institute of Education&quot;. All humanities-based courses at the former St Patrick&#x27;s were then absorbed by DCU&#x27;s Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. The campus of the former college is now known as DCU St Patrick&#x27;s Campus.

==History==

=== Early years ===
The college was established at 1–2 Drumcondra Road in 1875, moving to Belvedere House in 1883 after its purchase by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin from the Christian Brothers, when the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentian) community took over the running of the college. In its first 25 years over 2,000 students graduated from the college. The college trained male students to become primary school teachers; other colleges trained female teachers.

In 1894, a national school (primary) was established on campus and students would practice there.

=== 20th century ===
The campus was redeveloped using a design by Andrew Devane in the 1960s. This involved the construction of a number of new buildings, which incorporated the historical fabric of the older buildings on the site. A new church and residential blocks were also part of the scheme.

Female students were admitted from 1971.

==== Linkage with Dublin City University ====

St Patrick&#x27;s College of Education was a recognised college of the National University of Ireland from 1975 to 1995. In 1993, the college commenced its association with the nearby Dublin City University (DCU) which had been raised to university status in 1989. In 1995 the college of education formally ended its connection with the NUI and became a college of DCU.

The college developed a number of arts and humanities undergraduate and postgraduate courses with DCU.

The Vincentian administration of the college ended in 1999. In 2008 the college, along with other local education colleges, Mater Dei and All Hallows, signed a new linkage agreement with Dublin City University. In May 2012, it was announced that there would be a €40 million investment in facilities at the college to provide for 2,500 students.

==== Presidents of the College ====
Daire Keogh, of the history department, was the 14th and last president of the college, from 2012 to 2016, taking over from fellow historian Pauric Travers (1999-2012), in September 2012. Travers had been the first lay president of the college when appointed in 1999. Previous presidents of the college have included Peter Byrne (1883-1919) when the Vincentian order came to the college (earlier the head of the college would have been termed the Superior), Jerome Twomey (1942-1948), Donal Cregan (1957-1976) and Simon (Sam) Clyne (1985-1999). Keogh later became the fourth president of Dublin City University.

==Belvedere House==

Notable buildings on the campus include Belvedere House which was built c. 1660 by Robert Booth, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.

Residents of the house included:
*Marmaduke Coghill, Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland
*Henry Singleton, MP for Drogheda and later Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas
*John Bowes, 1st Baron Bowes, Lord Chancellor of Ireland
*James Hewitt, 1st Viscount Lifford, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and former MP for Coventry
*Richard Robinson, 1st Baron Rokeby, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh. Lord Rokeby founded, in 1790, Armagh Observatory.

The Congregation of Christian Brothers established a novitiate in the house prior to transferring to Coláiste Mhuire, Marino, in 1875, when they sold Belvedere House to Cardinal Cullen for £3,000 for the establishment of the college.

==Faculty and departments==
The college was divided into two faculties, Education and Humanities. From the time of its affiliation to DCU, the college&#x27;s offering of humanities programmes increased.

===Faculty of Education===
* Education
* Religious studies and education
* Special education
* Bioscience
* Human development

===Faculty of Humanities===
* English
* Irish (Roinn na Gaeilge)
* Mathematics
* French
* History
* Geography
* Music

== Student services and students&#x27; union ==
St Pat&#x27;s provided a variety of student services such as career advice, access support, mature student support, medical and welfare services and an international office.

The college also had a students&#x27; union which oversaw clubs such as GAA, rugby, soccer, and other pursuits, and societies for drama, St Vincent De Paul, and a choral society.

St Pat&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union had two sabbatical positions and seven non-sabbatical positions. In 2015, students voted to change the structure of the union.

===Erins Hope===
St Pat&#x27;s were invited to enter the Dublin Senior Football Championship under the name Erins Hope. Erins Hope were Dublin football champions on four occasions in 1887, 1932, 1956 and 1978. In 2007 Erins Hope failed to field a team for the Dublin championship and had to withdraw from the tournament.

== Alumni ==
Notable alumni of the college include:
* Patrick Breen - teacher and president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (1924-1926)
* Patrick Deeley - poet and memoirist
* James &quot;Cha&quot; Fitzpatrick - Kilkenny All Ireland-winning hurler

<text>Selective reduction is the practice of reducing the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy, such as quadruplets, to a twin or singleton pregnancy. The procedure is also called multifetal pregnancy reduction. The procedure is most commonly done to reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy to a safe number, when the multiple pregnancy is the result of use of assisted reproductive technology; outcomes for both the mother and the babies are generally worse the higher the number of fetuses. The procedure is also used in multiple pregnancies when one of the fetuses has a serious and incurable disease, or in the case where one of the fetuses is outside the uterus, in which case it is called selective termination.

The procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing to select which fetuses to reduce, and the 2nd day for the procedure itself, in which potassium chloride is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging. Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, retained placenta, infection, a miscarriage, and prelabor rupture of membranes. Each of these appears to be rare.

Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.

==Medical use==

Selective reduction is used when a mother is carrying an unsafe or undesirable number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy, which are common in medically assisted pregnancies. The result is a reduction in the number of fetuses to a number that is more safe for the mother and the remaining fetuses or more compatible with socio-economic constraints on the caregivers. It is also used in cases of multiple pregnancy where at least one of the fetuses is implanted outside the uterus to preserve the life of the mother and the fetus in the uterus, and when one or more of the fetuses has a serious and incurable disease. One example of is TRAP syndrome, where one fetus lacks a heart; the second twin, termed a &quot;pump&quot; twin therefore supplies the second twin with blood, leading to heart failure and death in the second twin in 50-75% of cases if the acardiac twin is not terminated.

While the data is weak, due to the small sizes of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials, as of 2017 it appeared that when short term perinatal outcomes in multiple pregnancies reduced to twins are compared to those of non-reduced triplets, there were fewer deaths among the babies born to mothers who underwent reduction, the twins were born later and were less likely to be premature, and had higher birthweight. As of 2017, longterm outcomes were not well understood. A 2015 Cochrane review found no randomized clinical trials to evaluate.

===Outcomes===
Generally selective reduction reduces the risk of preterm birth, leading to better outcomes for both mothers and the newborns.

It appears that reduction of triplets, where each triplet is in its own placenta, to twins results in a lower risk of preterm birth and does not increase the risk of miscarriage. In triplets where two of the fetuses share a placenta and each has its own amniotic sac, it appears, with less certainty, that there is also a lower risk of preterm birth and no increase in the risk of miscarriage.

==Adverse effects==
Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, retained placenta, infection, a miscarriage, and prelabor rupture of membranes. Each of these appears to be rare.

==Procedure==
The reduction procedure is generally carried out during the first trimester of pregnancy. The procedure often takes two days; the first day is for testing, and the procedure happens on the second day. The fetuses are evaluated, first by ultrasound, then often by testing the amniotic fluid and chorionic villus sampling; these tests help determine which fetuses are accessible for the procedure, and whether any fetuses are unhealthy. Once the specific fetuses to be reduced are identified, potassium chloride is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging; the heart stops and the fetus dies as a result. Generally, the fetal material is reabsorbed into the woman&#x27;s body.

==History==
Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART) became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses. The procedure was somewhat controversial from the beginning and drew some attention from anti-abortion activists. 

A set of ethical guidelines was developed in collaboration with a bioethicist from the National Institute for Health and was published in 1988; it justified reducing pregnancies with more than three fetuses to two or three.

Over time, more and more women in the developed world sought to become pregnant when they were older, having the first child when they were over forty years old. At the same time, the number of obstetrician-gynecologists with the required expertise increased and their role in family planning evolved. These trends led to more women asking for reduction to one fetus. These requests increasingly came from women pregnant with twins due to advances in the field of ART which made massively multiple pregnancies rarer. Selective reduction of twins was very controversial at first but has gradually become more accepted. One of the authors of the 1988 guidelines updated his stance and expressed a desire for the procedure to become more available in 2014. Sex-selective reduction is widely considered to be unethical in making decisions about which fetus to keep.

<doc id="540476" wikidata="Q2547089" url="?curid=540476" title="Subobject">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a subobject is, roughly speaking, an object that sits inside another object in the same category. The notion is a generalization of concepts such as subsets from set theory, subgroups from group theory, and subspaces from topology. Since the detailed structure of objects is immaterial in category theory, the definition of subobject relies on a morphism that describes how one object sits inside another, rather than relying on the use of elements.

The dual concept to a subobject is a . This generalizes concepts such as quotient sets, quotient groups, quotient spaces, quotient graphs, etc.

==Definitions==
An appropriate categorical definition of &quot;subobject&quot; may vary with context, depending on the goal. One common definition is as follows.

In detail, let &quot;formula_1&quot; be an object of some category. Given two monomorphisms

:formula_2

with codomain &quot;formula_1&quot;, we define an equivalence relation by formula_4 if there exists an isomorphism formula_5 with formula_6.

Equivalently, we write formula_7 if formula_8 factors through &quot;formula_9&quot;—that is, if there exists formula_5 such that formula_6. The binary relation formula_12 defined by

:formula_13

is an equivalence relation on the monomorphisms with codomain &quot;formula_1&quot;, and the corresponding equivalence classes of these monomorphisms are the subobjects of &quot;formula_1&quot;.

The relation ≤ induces a partial order on the collection of subobjects of formula_1.

The collection of subobjects of an object may in fact be a proper class; this means that the discussion given is somewhat loose. If the subobject-collection of every object is a set, the category is called &quot;well-powered&quot; or, rarely, &quot;locally small&quot; (this clashes with a different usage of the term locally small, namely that there is a set of morphisms between any two objects).

To get the dual concept of quotient object, replace &quot;monomorphism&quot; by &quot;epimorphism&quot; above and reverse arrows. A quotient object of &quot;A&quot; is then an equivalence class of epimorphisms with domain &quot;A.&quot;

However, in some contexts these definitions are inadequate as they do not concord with well-established notions of subobject or quotient object. In the category of topological spaces, monomorphisms are precisely the injective continuous functions; but not all injective continuous functions are subspace embeddings. In the category of rings, the inclusion formula_17 is an epimorphism but is not the quotient of formula_18 by a two-sided ideal. To get maps which truly behave like subobject embeddings or quotients, rather than as arbitrary injective functions or maps with dense image, one must restrict to monomorphisms and epimorphisms satisfying additional hypotheses. Therefore, one might define a &quot;subobject&quot; to be an equivalence class of so-called &quot;regular monomorphisms&quot; (monomorphisms which can be expressed as an equalizer of two morphisms) and a &quot;quotient object&quot; to be any equivalence class of &quot;regular epimorphisms&quot; (morphisms which can be expressed as a coequalizer of two morphisms)

==Interpretation==
This definition corresponds to the ordinary understanding of a subobject outside category theory. When the category&#x27;s objects are sets (possibly with additional structure, such as a group structure) and the morphisms are set functions (preserving the additional structure), one thinks of a monomorphism in terms of its image. An equivalence class of monomorphisms is determined by the image of each monomorphism in the class; that is, two monomorphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; into an object &quot;T&quot; are equivalent if and only if their images are the same subset (thus, subobject) of &quot;T&quot;. In that case there is the isomorphism formula_19 of their domains under which corresponding elements of the domains map by &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, respectively, to the same element of &quot;T&quot;; this explains the definition of equivalence.

==Examples==
In Set, the category of sets, a subobject of &quot;A&quot; corresponds to a subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, or rather the collection of all maps from sets equipotent to &quot;B&quot; with image exactly &quot;B&quot;. The subobject partial order of a set in Set is just its subset lattice.

In Grp, the category of groups, the subobjects of &quot;A&quot; correspond to the subgroups of &quot;A&quot;.

Given a partially ordered class P = (&quot;P&quot;, ≤), we can form a category with the elements of &quot;P&quot; as objects, and a single arrow from &quot;p&quot; to &quot;q&quot; iff &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;q&quot;. If P has a greatest element, the subobject partial order of this greatest element will be P itself. This is in part because all arrows in such a category will be monomorphisms.

A subobject of a terminal object is called a subterminal object.

The system also contains several trolley lines and interurban lines. The five T line branches and the single G line were inherited from the former Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) and originally built by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT). The two D line branches were built by the Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company (P&amp;WCTC) and later inherited by the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company (PSTC). Operation of these two branches were taken over by SEPTA in 1970.

<text>Rapid Creek is a tributary of the Cheyenne River, approximately 86 mi (138 km) long, in South Dakota in the United States. The creek&#x27;s name comes from the Sioux Indians of the area, for the many rapids in the stream.

== Course ==
It rises in southwestern South Dakota, in the Black Hills National Forest in the Black Hills in Pennington County. It flows east, is joined by Castle Creek, past Silver City and through the Pactola Reservoir. Emerging from the Black Hills, it flows through Rapid City, past Farmingdale, and joins the Cheyenne River approximately 13 mi (21 km) southwest of Wasta.

==1972 flood==
The Rapid Creek is most noted for the Black Hills flood of 1972, in which 238 people perished in Rapid City and in the Black Hills. Since the flood, a flood plain has been established throughout the city making development along the banks inconsiderable.

<text>London Colney () is a village and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England. It is located to the north of London, close to Junction 22 of the M25 motorway.

It is around south-east of St Albans city centre (and within said city&#x27;s contiguous built-up area) and part of the City and District of St Albans. At the time of the 2011 census the population of London Colney ward was 9,507, increasing to 9,804 at the 2021 census. It is considered a satellite or dormitory village of St Albans, where some villagers travel to work and shop.

==History==
Colney was first recorded in the 13th century. It takes its name from the River Colne, with the Old English suffix &quot;ēa&quot;, meaning &quot;river&quot;. The name London Colney, first recorded in 1555, referred to &quot;Colney on the road to London&quot;, and distinguished the place from Colney Street.

The village was on the boundary of the 1860s London Coal Tax area; two posts still stand.

London Colney was historically part of the ancient parish of St Albans St Peter. In 1894 it became part of the civil parish of St Peter Rural, which was abolished in 1947 when London Colney became a separate civil parish.

London Colney Primary School was initially due to open on 4 September 1939. It was then closed on the same day, as war was declared. It opened properly a day later.

In the early morning of 12 May 1941, a German spy, Karel Richter, descended by parachute near London Colney. Richter buried his equipment and hid for a couple of days. Driven out by hunger (he had mistakenly buried his food parcel as well), Richter was approached by two lorry drivers who asked him the way to London. Suspicious of Richter&#x27;s non-committal reply and foreignness, the lorry drivers then approached Constable Alec Scott and mentioned the strange man. Scott found Richter who asked to be taken to a hospital as he was feeling unwell. Scott called his superiors who quickly sent a car to pick up Richter and take him to jail.

==Local features==

The village has several estate agents; a motorcycle showroom; a tattooist; several takeaways; hairdressers; supermarkets, one incorporating a post office; a tanning salon; and a turf accountant. There is also a retail park, Colney Fields, which contains a Sainsbury&#x27;s, Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s, Next, Boots, Monsoon and TK Maxx.

There are several doctor&#x27;s practices and a library.

Associated with the village there are walks, nature reserves and ponds. The Mosquito Aircraft Museum, now known as the de Havilland Aircraft Museum, established in 1959, is located at Salisbury Hall on the south side of the M25 motorway.

London Colney has a great selection of open-water fishing in the River Colne and associated lakes.

==Geography==

The High Street crosses the River Colne (a tributary of the Thames joining at Staines-upon-Thames) at the multi-arched brick-built Telford&#x27;s Bridge (a Grade II listed building, apparently not by Thomas Telford). The original fording point can still be seen on the Western side of the bridge, with the Bull and Green Dragon pubs conveniently situated on opposite sides of the ford. Nearby flooded gravel pits form a nature reserve for wild birds. The A6 used to pass through the village. The bypass was built in 1959, to join with the A414 at the north end of the village. The A6 became the A1081 in 1986, with the M25 erasing the original South Mimms Bypass and the dualled section south of London Colney.

==The Parish==
London Colney Parish Council publishes a quarterly magazine, called &quot;The London Colney News&quot;. The magazine has been produced continuously since 1984.

==Sport and leisure==
Arsenal F.C. has its training ground near Bell Lane, London Colney. Watford F.C. also train in London Colney on Arsenal F.C.&#x27;s old training ground, University College London Union&#x27;s (UCLU) Sports Grounds, which is situated between the Arsenal Training Centre and the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre.

London Colney has a non-League football team, London Colney F.C., who play at Cotlandswick Playing Fields.

==Transport==
The 84 bus route runs through London Colney towards St Albans from Barnet, and Uno bus routes 602, 636, 658 and 659 also connect the village with St Albans, Hatfield, Watford, Borehamwood and Luton.

==Local residents==
The actor Philip Madoc lived in the village for a number of years.

A minor scandal occurred in 2004, when local resident Jake &#x27;the Snake&#x27; Roberts was convicted of cruelty to animals after allowing his pet snake to starve to death. The story appeared in the &quot;Herts Advertiser&quot; newspaper, and noted that the former WWE wrestler lived in Whitehorse Lane.

<text>The Ashton Memorial is a folly in Williamson Park, Lancaster, Lancashire, England built between 1907 and 1909 by the millionaire industrialist Lord Ashton in memory of his second wife, Jessy, at a cost of £87,000 (equivalent to £ in ).

==Description==
At around 150 feet (50 m) tall, it dominates the Lancaster skyline and is visible for many miles around, and has views of the surrounding area including Morecambe Bay. The building is in the Edwardian Baroque style and was designed by John Belcher. It has been described as &quot;England&#x27;s grandest folly&quot; and the &quot;Taj Mahal of the North&quot;. The dome is externally of copper, the main stone used is Portland stone; however, the steps are of hard-wearing granite from Cornwall.

The external stonework is hung on a steel frame as found in modern buildings and only forms a weatherproof covering without being loadbearing. In recent times this steelwork has caused problems for the conservation of the building. Externally around the dome are sculptures representing &quot;Commerce&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Industry&quot; and &quot;Art&quot; by Herbert Hampton, who was also responsible for the design of the Queen Victoria Memorial, Lancaster commissioned by James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton the previous year. The interior of the dome has allegorical paintings of &quot;Commerce&quot;, &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;History&quot; by George Murray. The floor is of white, black and red marble.

Today, the memorial serves as an exhibition space on the upper floor and a venue for concerts and weddings.

The Ashton Memorial stands coincidentally close to the mathematical centre point of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, excluding the Isle of Man. See Centre points of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="540497" wikidata="Q371884" url="?curid=540497" title="Timaeus (dialogue)">
<text>Timaeus (; , ) is one of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, mostly in the form of long monologues given by Critias and Timaeus, written 360 BC. The work puts forward reasoning on the possible nature of the physical world and human beings and is followed by the dialogue &quot;Critias&quot;.

Participants in the dialogue include Socrates, Timaeus, Hermocrates, and Critias. Some scholars believe that it is not the Critias of the Thirty Tyrants who appears in this dialogue, but his grandfather, also named Critias. At the beginning of the dialogue, the absence of another, unknown dialogue participant, present on the day before, is bemoaned. It has been suggested from some traditions—Diogenes Laertius (VIII 85) from Hermippus of Smyrna (3rd century BC) and Timon of Phlius ( 320 – 235 BC)—that &quot;Timaeus&quot; was influenced by a book about Pythagoras, written by Philolaus, although this assertion is generally considered false.

==Introduction==

The dialogue takes place the day after Socrates described his ideal state. In Plato&#x27;s works, such a discussion occurs in the &quot;Republic&quot;. Socrates feels that his description of the ideal state was not sufficient for the purposes of entertainment and that &quot;I would be glad to hear some account of it engaging in transactions with other states&quot; (19b).

Hermocrates wishes to oblige Socrates and mentions that Critias knows just the account (20b) to do so. Critias proceeds to tell the story of Solon&#x27;s journey to Egypt where he hears the story of Atlantis, and how Athens used to be an ideal state that subsequently waged war against Atlantis (25a). Critias believes that he is getting ahead of himself, and mentions that Timaeus will tell part of the account from the origin of the universe to man.

Critias also cites the Egyptian priest in Sais about long-term factors on the fate of mankind:There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, Phaethon, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father&#x27;s chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals.

The history of Atlantis is postponed to &quot;Critias&quot;. The main content of the dialogue, the exposition by Timaeus, follows.

==Synopsis of Timaeus&#x27; account==
===Nature of the physical world===

Timaeus begins with a distinction between the physical world, and the eternal world. The physical one is the world which changes and perishes: therefore it is the object of opinion and unreasoned sensation. The eternal one never changes: therefore it is apprehended by reason (28a).

The speeches about the two worlds are conditioned by the different nature of their objects. Indeed, &quot;a description of what is changeless, fixed and clearly intelligible will be changeless and fixed,&quot; (29b), while a description of what changes and is likely, will also change and be just likely. &quot;As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief&quot; (29c). Therefore, in a description of the physical world, one &quot;should not look for anything more than a likely story&quot; (29d).

Timaeus suggests that since nothing &quot;becomes or changes&quot; without cause, then the cause of the universe must be a demiurge or a god, a figure Timaeus refers to as the father and maker of the universe. And since the universe is fair, the demiurge must have looked to the eternal model to make it, and not to the perishable one (29a). Hence, using the eternal and perfect world of &quot;forms&quot; or ideals as a template, he set about creating our world, which formerly only existed in a state of disorder.

===Purpose of the universe===
Timaeus continues with an explanation of the creation of the universe, which he ascribes to the handiwork of a divine craftsman. The demiurge, being good, wanted there to be as much good as was the world. The demiurge is said to bring order out of substance by imitating an unchanging and eternal model (paradigm). &quot;Ananke&quot;, often translated as &#x27;Necessity&#x27;, was the only other co-existent element or presence in Plato&#x27;s cosmogony. Later Platonists clarified that the eternal model existed in the mind of the demiurge.

===Properties of the universe===

Timaeus describes the substance as a lack of homogeneity or balance, in which the four elements (earth, air, fire and water) were shapeless, mixed and in constant motion. Considering that order is favourable over disorder, the essential act of the creator was to bring order and clarity to this substance. Therefore, all the properties of the world are to be explained by the demiurge&#x27;s choice of what is fair and good; or, the idea of a dichotomy between good and evil.

First of all, the world is a &quot;living creature&quot;. Since the unintelligent creatures are in their appearance less fair than intelligent creatures, and since intelligence needs to be settled in a soul, the demiurge &quot;put intelligence in soul, and soul in body&quot; in order to make a living and intelligent whole. &quot;Wherefore, using the language of probability, we may say that the world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence of God&quot; (30a–b).

Then, since the part is imperfect compared to the whole, the world had to be one and only. Therefore, the demiurge did not create several worlds, but a single unique world (31b). Additionally, because the demiurge wanted his creation to be a perfect imitation of the Eternal &quot;One&quot; (the source of all other emanations), there was no need to create more than one world.

The creator decided also to make the perceptible body of the universe by four elements, in order to render it &quot;proportioned&quot;. Indeed, in addition to fire and earth, which make bodies visible and solid, a third element was required as a mean: &quot;two things cannot be rightly put together without a third; there must be some bond of union between them&quot;. Moreover, since the world is not a surface but a solid, a fourth mean was needed to reach harmony: therefore, the creator placed water and air between fire and earth. &quot;And for these reasons, and out of such elements which are in number four, the body of the world was created, and it was harmonised by proportion&quot; (31–33).

As for the figure, the demiurge created the world in the geometric form of a &quot;globe&quot;. Indeed, the round figure is the most perfect one, because it comprehends or averages all the other figures and it is the most omnimorphic of all figures: &quot;he [the demiurge] considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the unlike&quot; (33b).

The creator assigned then to the world a rotatory or &quot;circular movement&quot;, which is the &quot;most appropriate to mind and intelligence&quot; on account of its being the most uniform (34a).

Finally, he created the soul of the world, placed that soul in the center of the world&#x27;s body and diffused it in every direction. Having thus been created as a perfect, self-sufficient and intelligent being, the world is a &quot;god&quot; (34b).

===The creation of the world-soul===
Timaeus then explains how the soul of the world was created (Plato&#x27;s following discussion is obscure, and almost certainly intended to be read in light of the &quot;Sophist&quot;). The demiurge combined three elements: two varieties of &quot;Sameness&quot; (one indivisible and another divisible), two varieties of &quot;Difference&quot; (again, one indivisible and another divisible), and two types of &quot;Being&quot; (or &quot;Existence,&quot; once more, one indivisible and another divisible). From this emerged three compound substances: intermediate (or mixed) Being, intermediate Sameness, and intermediate Difference. Compounding these three intermediate substances together, one final substance resulted: the world-soul. He then divided following precise mathematical proportions, cutting the compound lengthways, fixed the resulting two bands in their middle, like in the letter chi (Χ) and connected them at their ends, to have two crossing circles. The demiurge imparted on them a circular movement on their axis: the outer circle was assigned Sameness and turned horizontally to the right, while the inner circle was assigned to Difference and turned diagonally and to the left (34c–36c).

The demiurge gave the primacy to the motion of Sameness and left it undivided; but he divided the motion of Difference in six parts, to have seven unequal circles. He prescribed these circles to move in opposite directions, three of them with equal speeds, the others with unequal speeds, but always in proportion. These circles are the orbits of the heavenly bodies: the three moving at equal speeds are the Sun, Venus and Mercury, while the four moving at unequal speeds are the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (36c–d). The complicated pattern of these movements is bound to be repeated again after a period called a &#x27;complete&#x27; or &#x27;perfect&#x27; year (39d).

Then, the demiurge connected the body and the soul of the universe: he diffused the soul from the center of the body to its extremities in every direction, allowing the invisible soul to envelop the visible body. The soul began to rotate and this was the beginning of its eternal and rational life (36e).

Therefore, having been composed by Sameness, Difference and Existence (their mean), and formed in right proportions, the soul declares the sameness or difference of every object it meets: when it is a sensible object, the inner circle of the Diverse transmits its movement to the soul, whereby opinions arise, but when it is an intellectual object, the circle of the Same turns perfectly round and true knowledge arises (37a–c).

The world as a whole, the planets, and the stars are living, visible gods (39e) that have an important role in creating human beings and regulating their moral life (41d).

===The elements===
Timaeus claims that the minute particle of each element had a special geometric shape: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth).

Timaeus makes conjectures on the composition of the four elements which some ancient Greeks thought constituted the physical universe: earth, water, air, and fire. Timaeus links each of these elements to a certain Platonic solid: the element of earth would be a cube, of air an octahedron, of water an icosahedron, and of fire a tetrahedron. Each of these perfect polyhedra would be in turn composed of triangular faces the 30-60-90 and the 45-45-90 triangles. The faces of each element could be broken down into its component right-angled triangles, either isosceles or scalene, which could then be put together to form all of physical matter. Particular characteristics of matter, such as water&#x27;s capacity to extinguish fire, was then related to shape and size of the constituent triangles. The fifth element (i.e. Platonic solid) was the dodecahedron, whose faces are not triangular, and which was taken to represent the shape of the Universe as a whole, possibly because of all the elements it most approximates a sphere, which Timaeus has already noted was the shape into which God had formed the Universe.

The extensive final part of the dialogue addresses the creation of humans, including the soul, anatomy, perception, and transmigration of the soul. Plato also discusses the creation of the body, as well as the causes of bodily and psychic diseases.

==Later influence==
The &quot;Timaeus&quot; was translated into Latin first by Marcus Tullius Cicero around 45 BC (sections 27d–47b), and later by Calcidius in the 4th century AD (up to section 53c). Cicero&#x27;s fragmentary translation was highly influential in late antiquity, especially on Latin-speaking Church Fathers such as Saint Augustine who did not appear to have access to the original Greek dialogue. The manuscript production and preservation of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; (among many other Latin philosophical works) is largely due to the works of monastic scholars, especially at Corbie in North-East France during the Carolingian Period.

Calcidius&#x27; more extensive translation of the &quot;Timaeus&quot; had a strong influence on medieval Neoplatonic cosmology and was commented on particularly by 12th-century Christian philosophers of the Chartres School, such as Thierry of Chartres and William of Conches, who, interpreting it in the light of the Christian faith, understood the dialogue to refer to a creatio ex nihilo. Calcidius himself never explicitly linked the Platonic creation myth in the &quot;Timaeus&quot; with the Old Testament creation story in Genesis in his commentary on the dialogue.

The dialogue was also highly influential in Arabic-speaking regions beginning in the 10th century AD. The &quot;Catalogue&quot; (fihrist) of Ibn al-Nadīm provides some evidence for an early translation by Ibn al-Bitriq (Al-Kindī&#x27;s circle). It is believed that the Syrian Nestorian Christian Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809 – 873 AD) corrected this translation or translated the entire work himself. However, only the circulation of many exegeses of &quot;Timaeus&quot; is confirmed. There is also evidence of Galen&#x27;s commentary on the dialogue being highly influential in the Arabic-speaking world, with Galen&#x27;s &quot;Synopsis&quot; being preserved in a medieval Arabic translation.

During much of the Middle Ages in the Latin-speaking West the &quot;Timaeus&quot; was the sole work of Plato which was typically available in monastic libraries. In the fourteenth century, Petrarch (1304-1374) noted having difficulty locating a copy.

In his introduction to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot;, 19th-century translator Benjamin Jowett comments, &quot;Of all the writings of Plato, the Timaeus is the most obscure and repulsive to the modern reader.&quot;

<text>Mater Dei Institute of Education () was a linked college of Dublin City University from 1999 until its closure in 2016, located in Drumcondra, Dublin City, Ireland, near Croke Park, on the site of what was formerly Clonliffe College, the Roman Catholic Seminary for the Archdiocese of Dublin. The college was founded by Archbishop John Charles McQuaid in 1966 as an institute for the training and formation for teachers of religion in secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland. Clonliffe was also affiliated to the Angelicum in Rome that offered a three-year course leading to a diploma and a four-year course leading to a Masters; Fr. Joseph Carroll was its first president. Other Presidents of the College included Msgr. Michael Nolan, Dr. Dermot Lane and Sr. Eileen Randles IBVN(1986-1995).
The foundation of the college was a response to the challenges posed by the Second Vatican Council. It had a Roman Catholic ethos and had approximately 800 students.

The college closed on 30 November 2016 when it was fully incorporated into the DCU Institute of Education, within which is &quot;The Mater Dei Centre for Catholic Education (MDCCE)&quot; continuing its mission.

The college offered several undergraduate courses, primarily in secondary religious education and specialized its postgraduate courses (including Doctorates) in religion, the humanities and education, and faith and culture as well as theology and philosophy in dialogue. The BA and MA in Religious Science were accredited by Maynooth(Pontifical University) which Mater Dei was affiliated to.

In 1999 Mater Dei Institute of Education became a College of Dublin City University.

In 2002 it established an Irish Studies Department and offered a BA programme in Religious Studies and Irish Studies. The Institute saw this as a contribution to the understanding what was engendered by the Good Friday Agreement. The Institute also had links with colleges in Northern Ireland, France, Italy and the USA. Mater Dei partners with the Methodist Edgehill Theological College (Belfast) co-offering such programmes as a BTh exploring faith together.

In 2008 the relationship linking Dublin City University with All Hallows, St. Patrick&#x27;s College of Education, Drumcondra and Mater Dei Institute of Education was revised.
The Institute was engaged in the Erasmus student exchange programme with other colleges in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain.

<text>Robert Henry Winters (August 18, 1910 – October 10, 1969) was a Canadian politician and businessman.

==Life and career==
Born in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, the son of a fishing captain, Winters went to Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, and then to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to complete his degree in electrical engineering. He worked for Northern Electric before joining the army in World War II, eventually becoming a lieutenant-colonel. He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1945 general election as a Liberal for the riding of Queens—Lunenburg in Nova Scotia. Winters was appointed to Cabinet in 1948, and served as minister of public works, among other portfolios, under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent.

Defeated along with the St. Laurent government in the 1957 election, Winters entered the corporate world, becoming a chief executive officer at a series of companies. He was hired as a special advisor to the Newfoundland government to help negotiate the Churchill Falls deal, for which he became highly popular in that province.

He was persuaded to return to politics by Lester Pearson, and won the Toronto seat of York West in the 1965 election, becoming minister of trade and commerce in Pearson&#x27;s government. He was seen as close to the business community and far more fiscally conservative than Walter L. Gordon. He originally announced that he would not seek to replace the retiring Pearson, but changed his mind and ran to succeed Pearson at the 1968 Liberal leadership convention, coming in second to Pierre Trudeau.

Winters then left politics, to become president and director of Brazilian Light and Power and a vice president of CIBC. Also, he was very involved in the new York University and served as the first chair of its board of governors.

==Death==
In 1969, while in California, he suffered a heart attack during a game of tennis. He died at age 59 in an ambulance on his way to hospital.

Winters College at York University is named in his honour.

<text>The Lune Millennium Bridge is a cable-stayed footbridge which spans the River Lune in Lancaster, England.

It was designed by Whitby Bird and Partners, and built at a cost of £1.8m to commemorate the millennium of 2000. The bridge forms a &quot;Y&quot;-shape in plan to connect one bank both to a viaduct and adjacent quay. Its double pylon seeks to act as a reminder of the masted ships which previously used the quay. It features a main gangway of just over 30 metres and masts around 40 metres tall.

The bridge is part of the National Cycle Network and connects multiple local cyclepaths together, including the one to Morecambe, the one to Caton and the one to Glasson Dock. It&#x27;s part of route 6 and its design received the Sustrans National Cycle Network Award for Excellence in 2005, and was commended in the Civic Trust Awards in 2003.

Its location is culturally significant as the near-approximate site of the historic Old Loyne Bridge.

<text>The Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) is a robotic device that attaches to the lower body. Its purpose is to complement the user&#x27;s strength by adding extra force to the user&#x27;s lower extremity bodily movements. The BLEEX was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and developed by the Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory, a unit within the University of California, Berkeley Department of Mechanical Engineering. DARPA provided the initial $50 million of start-up funds in 2001.

== Design ==
The BLEEX has four hydraulically actuated joints: two at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle. The BLEEX is energetically autonomous, meaning it has an on-board power supply.

Development later moved to Lockheed Martin, where the device became known as the Human Universal Load Carrier, or HULC.

== Performance ==
The BLEEX consumes 1143 watts of hydraulic power during ground-level walking along with another 200 watts of electrical power for electronics. It can support a load of while walking at , and can walk at up to without any load.

==History==

The college was established as a dedicated primary teacher training college for female teachers in 1898 by Bishop Edward Thomas O&#x27;Dwyer, Roman Catholic Bishop of Limerick and the Sisters of Mercy.

Its foundation stone was laid on the 8th of December 1898 and the college officially opened in 1902, accepting female students from Munster.

The college accepted male students for the first time in 1969. With a new curriculum in 1971, a number of major changes were initiated with teacher training in Ireland.

1974 saw the commencement of the three year B.Ed. degree with the first graduates in 1977, the course, like in other teacher training colleges, was previously a two-year National Teachers Diploma). From 1974 to 1994, Mary Immaculate College was a recognised college of the National University of Ireland. Due to a drop in the demand for school teachers, in the 1980s under Sr O&#x27;Connor and Sr Bulgers presidencies, the college diversified into non-education arts programmes, and began to initiate links with other international universities. Evening programmes were delivered with diplomas in computer studies, catechetics, and philosophy (awarded by NUI).

Following the granting of university status to NIHE Limerick in 1989, Mary Immaculate (as did Thomond College) began talks about a more formal relationship with UL. In 1991, the college became affiliated to the University of Limerick, with new Liberal Arts Programmes being offered by MIC. Degrees were awarded by the NUI until 1994, from 1995 degrees were conferred by UL.

2003 saw the first PhD awarded by Mary Immaculate.

<doc id="540532" wikidata="Q6960155" url="?curid=540532" title="Nakagusuku Bay">
<text>is a bay on the southern coast of Okinawa Island on the Pacific Ocean in Japan. The bay covers and ranges between to deep. The bay is surrounded by the municipalities of Uruma, Kitanakagusuku, Nakagusuku, Nishihara, Yonabaru, Nanjō, all in Okinawa Prefecture. In 1852, while visiting the Ryukyu Kingdom, Commodore Matthew Perry mapped Okinawa and labeled Nakagusuku Bay as &quot;Perry&#x27;s Bay&quot;. During the final months of World War II, the bay became a United States Navy forward base and was nicknamed &quot;Buckner Bay&quot;.

==History==

===Buckner Bay===
In June 1945, American forces secured Okinawa. Nakagusuku Bay became an important U.S. anchorage. United States Army troops referred to it as &quot;Buckner Bay&quot;, in memory of Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., commander of U.S. land forces in the campaign, who was killed on 18 June.

Naval Base Buckner Bay was built by Naval Construction Battalion 4 on the bay. It consisted of the anchorage, repair and depot ships, plus onshore support facilities for the US fleet operating off Japan. It also served as a supply and logistics center for forces on Okinawa. It was attacked several times during the closing weeks of the war. The USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was torpedoed there by a Japanese aircraft. The base continued operations into the immediate postwar period.

In October 1945, Typhoon Louise struck Buckner Bay, inflicting heavy damage. Fifteen merchant ships were driven ashore, some damaged beyond recovery. Three USN destroyers were also wrecked. Over 200 other U.S. military vessels, including six LCTs, various special-purpose boats, patrol boats, and landing craft were grounded, severely damaged, or destroyed altogether. Eighty percent of the buildings in the bay were completely wiped out, while over 60 aircraft then present at local airstrips were damaged.

===Present day===
In the present day, the Buckner Bay – White Beach Naval Port Facility is located on the southernmost tip of the Katsuren Peninsula. The bay is also referred to as &quot;Katchin Wan&quot;. The &quot;White Beach Navy Ammunition Pier&quot; and &quot;White Beach Army Pier&quot; extend into Nakagusuku Bay. Tatsu Kuchi, the main entrance into the bay, is located 18 nmi north-northeast of the southernmost tip of Okinawa. White Beach is also located about 14 nmi northeast of Naha. Numerous large and small islands, reefs, and shoal waters bracket the entrance.

&quot;Tengan Pier&quot; (26°24.2&#x27;N 127°51.1&#x27;E) is located at the western end of Kin Wan Bay. Kin Wan Bay is on the east central side of Okinawa between Kin Saki (Kin Point) and the Katsuren Peninsula.

==USFJ/MSDF Facilities==
There are two piers at White Beach. Navy Pier is under the control of the U.S. Navy Commander Fleet Activities Okinawa (CFAO) and is also used by the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as a back-up ordnance-handling pier. The coordinating authority for U. S. Navy vessels for both piers is Buckner Port Control, White Beach.

Navy Pier is used primarily by U.S. Navy vessels and Japanese Self-Defense Force minesweepers. The pier is approximately 2,400 ft (732 m) long. It consists of a 40 ft (12.2 m) wide by 1,220 ft (372 m) long earth-filled causeway and a 39 ft (11.9 m) wide by 386 ft (117.8 m) long structural causeway that is connected to the main pier. East Navy Pier space for berthing is 790 ft (240.8 m); West Navy Pier space for berthing is 810 ft (246.9 m). The Navy Pier has reinforced concrete pilings with a steel concrete surface. The deck height is 10 ft (3.1 m). Beyond the pier are two 25 ft (7.6 m) by 125 ft (38.1 m) mooring dolphin decks. Ships can moor bow in or bow out at these berths.

The Army Pier is an asphalt-surfaced causeway connecting to a steel pier reinforced with concrete and with a solid facing to the sea floor. The approximate total dimensions of the pier and the causeway are 1,224 ft (373 m) long by 100 ft (30.5 m) wide. The portion of the pier for berthing is approximately 525 ft (160 m) long with a deck height of 10 ft (3.1 m).

The &quot;Naha Pilot Association&quot; contracts pilot service. Sufficient advance notice must be given for scheduling a pilot and to allow time for the pilot to travel from Naha to Buckner Bay. Three Japanese commercial tugs rated at 3,200 hp are available for White Beach. A pilot is mandatory for U.S. Navy vessels berthing at the White Beach piers but is not required when anchoring. Pilots will not normally board ships with northerly winds greater than 30 kt or southerly winds greater than 26 kt. Wave heights greater than 4.9 ft (1.5 m) make it too difficult to get on or off the ship. All pilots possess adequate English language ability to convey helm and engine orders. Additionally, a qualified Japanese speaking dockmaster will be stationed pierside to assist in docking evolutions. The pilot and working tug primarily use Channel 13 VHF-FM but can be initially contacted via Channel 16 VHF-FM. The pilot pickup point is in the vicinity of 26°14&#x27;N 127°55&#x27;E. If required, a second tug will normally meet the ship at 26°16.4&#x27;N 127°54.3&#x27;E.

Anchorage and berthing assignments for Navy vessels are made by the Navy Port Control Officer located at White Beach. Navy Port Control can be contacted via Channel 16 VHF-FM or on 2716 kHz USB.

No repair facilities are located at White Beach.

Tengan Pier is the primary U.S. military ammunition cargo operations site in Okinawa. Ammunition and explosive handling operations are conducted on the pier from 0800 until sunset. Tengan pier has limited shelter from the weather. Anchorage berths can be coordinated through the ship&#x27;s agent or the local Military Sealift Command Office. Pilot rendezvous point is 26°25&#x27;N 127°58&#x27;E. Five tugs rated at 3,200 hp are available in Kin Wan Bay.

Tengan Pier is 82 ft (m) wide and 806 ft (m) long with reinforced concrete solid construction. The pier can accommodate two ships with one on each side.

Tengan Pier is connected to land by a 35 ft (m) wide by 1,300 ft (m) long causeway. Ship docking should be self-sustaining. There are no electric shore power outlets, CHT lines, or fuel lines for bunkering.

Approximately 95% of the MSC ships go to White Beach and Tengan Pier because of depth restrictions at the Port of Naha.

No repair facilities are available in the vicinity of Tengan Pier.

<doc id="540533" wikidata="Q2205806" url="?curid=540533" title="Norristown High Speed Line">
<text>The M, formerly known as the Norristown High Speed Line (NHSL), is a interurban light rapid transit line in the SEPTA Metro network, running between the 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby and the Norristown Transportation Center in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Service is operated by the Suburban Transit Division of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. Originally the Philadelphia and Western Railroad line (which is why the line is referred to by locals as &quot;the P&amp;W&quot;), the line runs entirely on its own right-of-way. By 2020, the Norristown High Speed Line had an average weekday ridership approaching 11,000 passengers.

The Norristown High Speed Line is unique in its combination of transportation technologies. Originally chartered as a Class I (steam) railroad, the line is fully grade separated, collects power from a third rail, and has high-level platforms common to rapid transit systems or commuter rail systems such as New York City&#x27;s Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, but has onboard fare collection, mostly single-car operation, and frequent stops more common to light rail systems. Previously, the Norristown High Speed Line was considered to be a light rail line, according to a 2008 SEPTA budget report; however, the line is currently considered an interurban heavy rail line, according to a 2009 SEPTA business plan, and subsequent capital budgets. It has also been categorized by the American Public Transportation Association as &quot;Intermodal High Speed rapid rail transit&quot;. 

The service is similar in design and use to the Mattapan Line in Boston. The purple color-coded line was formerly known simply as Route 100, but was officially changed to its current name in September 2009 as part of a customer service initiative by SEPTA. From 2024, the NHSL is to be rebranded as the M.

The line has been subject to multiple accidents. The first recorded crash occurred near an Ardmore stop on January 26, 1987 injuring 19. The operator tested positive for drugs and was convicted on reckless endangerment. Another crash occurred on July 6, 2012 between Beechwood-Brookline and Penfield stations when the cars detached and came back together, injuring 2. In August 2017, there was a crash involving an unoccupied railcar at the 69th Street Terminal that injured more than 40 people. As a result, the maximum operating speed on the line was decreased to from .

==History==
The Norristown High Speed Line began service in 1907 as the Philadelphia and Western Railroad (P&amp;W), which ran from the present 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania to a converted farmhouse station in Strafford, Pennsylvania. In 1911, the line was extended west to a new Strafford P&amp;W station adjacent to the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Strafford station, allowing easy interchange between the two lines. In 1912, a branch was constructed from Villanova Junction, west of the existing Villanova station, to Norristown. When the newly built branch quickly attracted more ridership than the Strafford main line, the Norristown section became the main line and the Strafford stretch was demoted to branch status; in the mid-1930s, the Strafford spur was narrowed to a single track for its last between the Wayne-St. Davids and Strafford stations, while the Norristown line received a sleek new art deco terminus at Main and Swede Streets.

===Lehigh Valley connection===
From Norristown, the P&amp;W RR connected its tracks with the Lehigh Valley Transit Liberty Bell Route to provide direct electric train service from 69th St. Terminal to Allentown, Pennsylvania. However, in 1951, the Lehigh Valley Transit Company ended its service on the Liberty Bell Route, and in 1953 the company ended all its remaining rail service. Two years later, the P&amp;W RR was taken over by the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company (PSTC), which was more popularly known as the Red Arrow Lines. In 1956, the Red Arrow abandoned the original branch between Villanova and Strafford, leaving only electric MU train service between 69th Street and Norristown, as it is today. Part of the Strafford branch right of way has been converted into the Radnor Trail. The PSTC was absorbed into SEPTA in 1970, eliminating the original railroad charter and immediately becoming the &quot;Norristown High-Speed Line &quot;Trolley&quot;&quot;, officially known as Route 100.

=== Modernization ===
By the mid-1980s, the line was in dire condition as the Brill Bullet rolling stock reached over 50 years in service. Cars suffered electrical fires and crashes, even causing a shutdown of the line for a number of months in 1985 and 1986, since many of the cars were inoperable. Full service was only restored in December of 1986, as SEPTA introduced former CTA 6000 series elevated cars into service. In 1990, as the last Brill Bullet cars were retired, former Market-Frankford line M-3 cars were also introduced alongside the CTA cars.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the line underwent a significant modernization program, rebuilding or improving then-dated tracks, electrical substations, the signaling system, bridges, both terminal buildings, and the maintenance depot. In addition to these right-of-way improvements, the new ASEA N-5 rolling stock entered service starting in 1993.

===Ridership===
Ridership on the Norristown Line peaked in 2016 at 3,429,300. The previous peak came in 2014 with 3,147,209 trips. Prior to this modern escalation in ridership the line&#x27;s ridership was highest in 1973 at 2.86 million annual linked trips, and again in 1980 with 2.579 million annual linked trips. Ridership statistics for fiscal years 2000 and later are from SEPTA annual service plans. Data for years 1972 to 1997 are from the SEPTA 1997 ridership census. There may be some discrepancy in how the ridership is reported since the annual service plans report total unlinked trips, while the ridership census uses linked trips, which may exclude passengers transferring from other lines.


===21st century===
Effective June 14, 2010, SEPTA changed the names of four stations to reflect the streets on which they were located. Township Line Road (formerly West Overbrook Station), Roberts Road (formerly Rosemont Station), Stadium – Ithan Avenue (formerly Stadium Station) and DeKalb Street (formerly King Manor Station).

In summer 2013, SEPTA closed the bridge (the Bridgeport Viaduct) carrying the Norristown High Speed Line over the Schuylkill River for four months. The bridge, which was built in 1911, had been deteriorating and needed to be rebuilt at a cost upwards of $30 million, though this repair project was budgeted at $7.5 million. As a result of closing the bridge, buses were used to transport passengers between the Bridgeport station and the Norristown Transportation Center. The bridge was reopened in November 2013. The remaining $30 million renovation of the entire bridge structure is currently unscheduled.
In 2021, SEPTA proposed rebranding their rail transit service as &quot;SEPTA Metro&quot;, in order to make the system easier to navigate. Under this proposal, the Norristown High Speed Line was to be rebranded as the &quot;M&quot; (for &quot;Montgomery&quot;, the county in which Norristown is located), with a purple color and numeric suffixes for service variants. The local service will be called the M1 Montgomery Local and the peak-hour express service will be called the M2 Montgomery Express. Had the proposed spur to King of Prussia, Pennsylvania been constructed, the proposal would have branded service utilizing the branch as the M3 Montgomery Local to KOP and the M4 Montgomery Express to King of Prussia, providing service between 69th Street Transportation Center, and First &amp; Moore/Valley Forge station, and the M5 Norristown / King of Prussia making local stops between First and Moore/Valley Forge station and Norristown Transportation Center. After a period of public comment, SEPTA revised its plans to primarily refer to the line as the &quot;M.&quot;

==Service==
The fare for a single ride as of January 2020 is $2.50 using cash or $2.00 using the Travel Wallet feature on a SEPTA Key card. Until September 1, 2014, the line used a &quot;pay-as-you-exit&quot; fare collection system on trains towards 69th Street Transportation Center. As part of a general change on several routes approaching 69th Street, passengers now pay onboard upon entering the train. Starting February 22, 2021, fares at 69th Street Transportation Center and Norristown Transportation Center are collected from station turnstiles at all times.

The service runs seven days a week from 5 AM to 2 AM. Local trains from 69th Street to Norristown stop at all 22 stations, and the trip lasts approximately 30 minutes. Occasionally, local trains may run only between 69th Street and Bryn Mawr, stopping at ten stations, or 69th Street and Hughes Park, stopping at 18 stations.

Before 2019 during weekday peak periods (6:00–9:00 AM, 2:15–6:45 PM), the Norristown High Speed Line featured express and limited services, which stop only at select stations, therefore decreasing travel time between 69th Street and Norristown. Norristown Express service, denoted by red destination signs, travels between 69th Street and Norristown in approximately 22 minutes, stopping at only 16 stations. Norristown Limited service, denoted by blue destination signs, travels between 69th Street and Norristown in approximately 26 minutes and stops at 8 stations. All trains share the same two tracks, so a limited leaving Norristown, for example, will be immediately followed by a local, which stops at more stations, and therefore is spaced farther from the previous train. The next limited will catch up with it. Similarly, a local may leave Bryn Mawr right after an express stops there, and get to 69th Street just before the next express or limited catches up with it.

A former Hughes Park Express service, which was denoted by green destination signs, traveled nonstop from 69th Street to Beechwood–Brookline and made all stops from there to Hughes Park in approximately 22 minutes.

==Station list==
Before December 7, 2020, if passengers wanted to board the train at the station, they would have to press a button on the platform, which turns on a light that tells the Operator to stop at the station. The train would only stop if it was scheduled to stop at the station; otherwise, trains did not stop even if the passenger pressed the button. All trains stopped at terminals.

After December 7, 2020, if passengers want to board the train at the station they have to be physically visible to the Operator for the train to stop. This is the same as on a light rail or tram/trolley line. In both cases detraining passengers must press a button on board to request the train to stop.
==King of Prussia Spur==

In 2013, it was proposed to create a branch off the Norristown High Speed Line to serve the King of Prussia Mall, Valley Forge office parks, and the Valley Forge Casino Resort. Many possible routes were planned for this extension, including one following US 202 from Norristown to King of Prussia, another following a utility right-of-way paralleling US 202 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and another following the utility right-of-way and Gulph Road. In 2014, SEPTA estimated that the expansion would cost between $500 million to $650 million, and was at least eight years away.

On February 29, 2016, SEPTA announced the preferred route based on cost-efficiency and environmental impact. The route would have branched off from the main Norristown High Speed Line between Hughes Park and DeKalb Street, followed a PECO transmission line right-of-way to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and then run parallel to the Turnpike to reach the King of Prussia Mall. It would then have followed Mall Boulevard before crossing the Turnpike and following First Avenue. Stations would have been located at Henderson Road, Allendale Road, Mall Boulevard, the intersection of First and Clark Avenues in the King of Prussia Business Park, and at First Avenue near the Valley Forge Casino Resort.

On January 25, 2018, the SEPTA board approved a final route alignment, selecting the locally preferred routing from among the options studied in the project&#x27;s draft environmental impact statement (EIS). The line was estimated to cost between $1 billion and $1.2 billion, with ridership estimated at 9,500 daily by 2040.&lt;ref name=&quot;1/18 routing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 2019, SEPTA engaged the engineering firm HNTB to design Phase I of the project. On December 1, 2020, SEPTA held a meeting to update the proposed alignment. The final environmental impact statement was planned to be submitted to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in early 2021. Construction on the spur to King of Prussia was projected to cost $2 billion and service was expected to begin between 2025 and 2027. 

Five new stations were to be added to the line as follows:
* Henderson Road station
* Allendale Road station 
* Mall Boulevard station
* First &amp; American Forge station
* First &amp; Moore/Valley Forge station (terminus)

On March 17, 2023, SEPTA stopped work on the extension of the Norristown High Speed Line to King of Prussia after determining it would not have the money to proceed forward after the FTA denied a capital grant to the project.

<doc id="540550" wikidata="Q2609164" url="?curid=540550" title="Ozzie Guillén">
<text>Oswaldo José Guillén Barrios (; born January 20, 1964) is a Venezuelan-American former professional baseball player who is the current manager of Tiburones de La Guaira of the Venezuelan League. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop for 16 seasons, primarily with the Chicago White Sox, from 1985 to 2000. During that time, he won the American League Rookie of the Year Award and also a Gold Glove. He was considered one of the best defensive shortstops of his era. Guillen later managed the Chicago White Sox from 2004 to 2011, winning the World Series in 2005 and then moving to the Miami Marlins in 2012.

As a player, Guillén was respected for his passion, speed, hustle, intensity and defensive abilities and his ebullient love for the game. In 2005, Guillen became the first Latino manager in major league history to win a World Series when he captained the Chicago White Sox to their first championship in 88 years.

==Playing career==

Guillén was a light-hitting, quick-handed shortstop, emerging from a line of Venezuelan shortstops that included Chico Carrasquel, Luis Aparicio (both White Sox players), Dave Concepción, and Omar Vizquel (who played for Guillen as a utility player for the White Sox). He was originally signed as a free agent by the San Diego Padres in 1980. In December 1984, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox as part of an eight-player trade, with Tim Lollar, Bill Long and Luis Salazar in exchange for LaMarr Hoyt.

In 1985, Guillén was both the American League Rookie of the Year and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year, while also becoming just the third rookie shortstop in major league history to win a fielding title. He became known for his daring, aggressive style of play, as was demonstrated on August 2, 1985, in a game against the New York Yankees. With the game tied 5–5 in the 11th inning, Guillén hit a two-out single and, then proceeded to steal second base. When the next batter hit an infield single, Guillén never hesitated as he rounded third base, catching the Yankees defense off guard and scored the game-winning run.

In 1989, Guillén was the victim of a hidden ball trick twice. First on June 23 when Greg Brock tagged him out when Guillén, the runner at first base, took his lead, and then had to dive back to the base on a pick off throw from the pitcher. Brock held the ball instead of throwing it back to the pitcher, and when Guillén took his hand off the base to stand up, Brock tagged him out. On August 5, Dave Bergman made the same play, holding onto the ball following a pick off throw. Guillén again dove to the base to beat the throw, and when he took his hand off the base to stand up, Bergman tagged him on top of the batting helmet without looking at him.

On April 21, 1992, Guillén suffered a severe knee injury in a collision with outfielder Tim Raines. The injury caused him to miss almost the entire season, and subsequently diminished his defensive range as well as his stolen base output for the remainder of his career. Guillén recovered in 1993 with his most productive season offensively, posting a .280 batting average, and he hit a career-high four home runs and had 50 runs batted in (RBI) in 134 games. The White Sox went on to win the American League Western Division title. He hit .273 and scored four runs in the 1993 American League Championship Series as the White Sox were defeated by the Toronto Blue Jays in six games.
In October 1997, after 13 seasons with the White Sox, Guillén was granted free agency status and signed a contract to play for the Baltimore Orioles. In May 1998, the Orioles released him and he signed with the Atlanta Braves as a utility infielder. He helped the Braves win the 1999 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets with a 10th inning, pinch hit single in Game 6 of the series that tied the score at nine runs apiece, as the Braves went on to win the game and the series. The Braves would eventually lose to the New York Yankees in Guillén&#x27;s only World Series appearance as a player. After playing one year with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2000, he retired as a player at the end of the season at the age of 36.

===Career statistics===
In a sixteen-year major league career, Guillén played in 1,993 games, accumulating 1,764 hits in 6,686 at bats for a .264 career batting average along with 28 home runs, 619 runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .287. Guillén was an All-Star in 1988, 1990–1991, and won the Gold Glove Award in 1990. He led American League shortstops twice in range factor, once in assists and once in fielding percentage. Guillén&#x27;s .974 career fielding percentage ranks him 40th overall among major league shortstops, ahead of, among others, of both Luis Aparicio and Dave Concepción. While he was considered one of the best fielding shortstops in the American League, Guillén was often overlooked in post-season fielding awards because his playing career coincided with that of Tony Fernandez, Cal Ripken Jr., and later Omar Vizquel. This trio would win every American League Gold Glove for a shortstop from 1986 until 2001, with the one exception being Guillén&#x27;s 1990 season award. Guillén ranks among the White Sox all-time leaders in games played (sixth), hits (seventh), at-bats (sixth), plate appearances (seventh), total bases (10th) and triples (10th). As a hitter, he was known as a free swinger, posting one of the highest at bats per walk ratios in major league history and also had one of the lowest on base percentages for many of the years he played. Guillén played his entire Venezuelan Winter League career with Tiburones de La Guaira.

==Managerial career==
===Chicago White Sox===
Following his playing career, Guillén coached for the Montreal Expos in 2001 and 2002 and the World champion Florida Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins). In 2003, he was hired in the offseason to replace Jerry Manuel as the White Sox manager. He received a standing ovation from the crowd of 37,706 Chicagoans when introduced before his first game as a manager at U.S. Cellular Field on April 13, 2004. On May 30, 2005, the White Sox extended Guillén&#x27;s contract, making the move while the team had the best record in the majors (33–17).

In 2005, he led the White Sox to their first American League pennant since 1959, and their first World Series win since 1917 with a four-game sweep of the Houston Astros. Guillén claimed that he might retire after the 2005 season should the White Sox win the World Series, but at the parade celebrating the World Champions he received cheers from the fans when he announced he would indeed return to manage the next season. The White Sox picked up the 2006 option on his contract, added two more years and included an option for the 2009 season. In November, Guillén was voted the 2005 American League Manager of the Year Award by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. On September 11, 2007, Guillén signed another contract extension with the White Sox through the 2012 season.

On September 4, 2009, Guillén won his 500th game as manager of the Chicago White Sox as the White Sox defeated the Boston Red Sox by a score of 12–2. Guillen has publicly stated that he feels the 2003 steroids list should be released to the public.

Personal difficulties with White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams led to speculation dating back to October 2010 that the White Sox would allow Guillén out of his contract to manage the Marlins. On September 26, 2011, an inability to get a contract extension worked out with the White Sox eventually led to his being released from his position, with the White Sox retaining the right to receive compensation should Guillén manage in the 2012 season. He finished with a record of 678 wins and 617 losses.

=== Miami Marlins ===

On September 28, 2011, the Miami Marlins introduced Guillén as their new manager. Robin Ventura replaced Guillén as manager of the White Sox. The Marlins sent Jhan Mariñez and Osvaldo Martínez to the Chicago White Sox as compensation for the hiring of Guillén by the Marlins, as Guillen had one year remaining on his contract with the White Sox.

The Marlins were expected to contend in their first year in their new park. However, an 8–18 June effectively ended their season, and they finished 69–93, their worst season since the start of the century. On October 23, 2012, Guillen was terminated from the Marlins, despite three years remaining on his contract, after making some inflammatory comments about Fidel Castro earlier in the year.

=== Tiburones de La Guaira ===
In February 2016, Guillen was hired to manage the Tiburones de La Guaira of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League for the 2016–17 season.

Guillen returned to manage Tiburones for the 2023–24 season, their first victory in 38 years. He won the LVBP championship and managed the team at the 2024 Caribbean Series, held at LoanDepot Park in Miami (where he had once managed the Marlins).

=== Other teams ===
In 2022 he was named bench coach for France in the World Baseball Classic, joining the staff of manager Bruce Bochy. The French team will compete in a qualifier in Regensburg, Germany in September.

===Managerial record===

==Broadcasting career==
Guillén joined ESPN Deportes in 2013, where he has worked as baseball color analyst and talk show panelist. He is currently a studio analyst for NBC Sports Chicago before and after White Sox games.

==Personal life==

Guillén married Ibis Cárdenas in 1983. They have three sons: Ozwaldo &quot;Ozzie&quot; Jr. (born 1985), Oney (born 1986), and Ozney (born 1992). Ozzie Jr. was born in Las Vegas, Nevada; his two younger brothers were born in Venezuela. When Ozzie Guillen turned 42 in January 2006, he, his wife, and son Oney became naturalized U.S. citizens. Ozzie Jr. is the lead Spanish-language broadcaster on the White Sox radio network.

He is also the brother-in-law of former White Sox teammate Scott Radinsky.

==Controversies==
Guillen is known for being somewhat eccentric and outspoken, which sometimes lands him in the middle of controversy. He declined to join in the traditional visit to the White House after the 2005 White Sox World Series win.

In June 2006 he was quoted as calling &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnist Jay Mariotti a fag. He later apologized for offending any LGBTQ people, but did not back down in his criticism of Mariotti.

In 2010, he spoke against Arizona&#x27;s new law to deal with illegal immigration. Guillen described illegal immigrants as &quot;workaholics.&quot; &quot;And this country can&#x27;t survive without them,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of people from this country who are lazy. We&#x27;re not. Prove me wrong. A lot of people in this country want to be on the computer and send e-mails to people. We do the hard work. We&#x27;re the ones who go out and work in the sun to make this country better.&quot; In August, Guillen said that Asian players were treated better than Latino players, stating that while it is common practice for major league clubs to provide a Japanese or Korean translator for their Asian born players, no such translator is provided for their Spanish-speaking Latin American ballplayers.

On April 10, 2012, Guillén was suspended for five games by the Marlins due to comments made about former Cuban president Fidel Castro. In a &quot;Time&quot; interview Guillen said, &quot;I love Fidel Castro ... I respect Fidel Castro. You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro for the last [53] years, but that mofo is still here.&quot; The fallout from those comments was a major factor in his ouster after the season; according to Marlins baseball operations chief Larry Beinfest, the Marlins&#x27; attendance flatlined after those remarks and never recovered; although the Marlins actually reached over two million fans in attendance that season (the third and so far last time that has happened for the Marlins), it was more due to the allure of a brand new stadium, Marlins Park.
