<text>Leibstadt is a municipality in the district of Zurzach in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

==History==
Leibstadt is first mentioned about 1240 as &quot;Leibesteit&quot;. In the 13th and 14th Centuries it was ruled by the Habsburgs. In 1323 two mills are mentioned in Leibstadt. After the 1415 conquest of the Aargau, the two parts of the village (Oberleibstadt and Unterleibstadt, separated by a creek) were ruled separately by various overlords. The former was part of the Austrian district of Laufenburg, while the latter was part of the Swiss Confederation&#x27;s district of Leuggern in the County of Baden. As a border village, Leibstadt was in danger any time the Habsburgs and the Confederation fought. A chronicle records that on 1 March 1499 men from Gansingen and Mettau attacked and burned most of the villages in the area, including Leibstadt. Between 1635 and 1798 the villages of Leibstadt and Schwaderloch formed the &quot;Roll&#x27;sche&quot; district of Bernau. Until 1816 Oberleibstadt belonged to the municipality of Leuggern and then formed its own political municipality (until 1832 it included Full-Reuenthal) within the Zurzach district. Unterleibstadt was an independent political municipality in the Laufenburg district. In 1866 the two municipalities merged to form Leibstadt and became part of the Zurzach district. The first school was founded in 1756 by the Knights order from Leuggern.

In 1880 Leibstadt resigned from the parish of Leuggern and formed their own Catholic parish (which included Schwaderloch between 1818 and 1953). The village chapel burned down in 1871 was replaced in 1879–80 with the present parish church.

A railway station was opened in Leibstadt in 1892, serving the Koblenz–Stein–Säckingen line. However, this closed in 1993 and only a Postauto bus travels to the municipality now. Into the latter half of the 20th century, agriculture was the main source of industry and income in Leibstadt. In 1973 the nuclear power company, Leibstadt AG, was founded to build a power plant in Leibstadt. The largest nuclear power plant in Switzerland, which cost about 4.8 billion CHF, came online in 1984. It produces about 7.2 billion kWh of electricity per year and provides about three-fifths of the jobs in the community.

<doc id="554172" wikidata="Q619551" url="?curid=554172" title="Apologue">
<text>An apologue or apolog (from the Greek ἀπόλογος, a &quot;statement&quot; or &quot;account&quot;) is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly. Unlike a fable, the moral is more important than the narrative details. As with the parable, the apologue is a tool of rhetorical argument used to convince or persuade.

==Overview==
Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of Jotham in the Book of Judges (9:7-15); &quot;The Belly and its Members,&quot; by the patrician Agrippa Menenius Lanatus in the second book of Livy; and perhaps most famous of all, those of Aesop. Well-known modern examples of this literary form include George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and the Br&#x27;er Rabbit stories derived from African and Cherokee cultures and recorded and synthesized by Joel Chandler Harris. The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects.

An apologue is distinguished from a fable in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as &quot;a satire in action.&quot;

==Apologue vs parable==
An apologue differs from a parable in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be &quot;true&quot; in the sense that &quot;when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it&quot;, while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: &quot;when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it.&quot; The parable reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don&#x27;t misbehave or you&#x27;ll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander). It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies.

The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, Martin Luther thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume. The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does.

Some commentators have attempted to relegate the apologue in literary and artistic importance. As René Wellek observes, Hegel in his &quot;Aesthetics&quot; (mediated to at least some extent by Hotho&#x27;s account) consigns the apologue, parable, and proverb, along with the fable, the epigram, the riddle, and all didactic and descriptive poetry as &quot;minor forms&quot; of literature that do not qualify as art at all.

==Origins==
The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with allegory, metaphor and imagination. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the slaves, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. The two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely Aesop and Phaedrus. Leading later writers of apologues were Giambattista Basile in Italy; La Fontaine in France; John Gay and Robert Dodsley in England; Christian Fürchtegott Gellert, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Friedrich von Hagedorn in Germany; Tomas de Iriarte in Spain; Ivan Krylov in Russia and Leonid Hlibov in Ukraine.

==Structure==
Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, &quot;Le Coq et la Perle&quot; (&quot;The Cock and the Pearl&quot;).

&quot;&quot;A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining amid the straw. “Ho! ho!” quoth he, “that’s for me,” and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? “You may be a treasure,” quoth Master Cock, “to men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.”&quot;

On the other hand, in the romances of Reynard the Fox we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, Corti, is said to have developed an apologue of &quot;The Talking Animals&quot; reaching twenty-six cantos.

==In literature==
La Motte, writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters amour-propre by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but Rousseau contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form.

A work by P. Soullé, &quot;La Fontaine et ses devanciers&quot; (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France.

Montesquieu wrote a propos his &quot;Persian Letters&quot; &quot;There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be &quot;felt&quot;. Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy.&quot;

André Alexis&#x27; &quot;Fifteen Dogs: an Apologue&quot;, an extended prosimetric example of apologue, was published in 2015, notably winning that year&#x27;s Giller Prize and subsequently earning Alexis the  Windham-Campbell Literature Prize.

<text>The Bolivian War of Independence (, 1809–1825) began with the establishment of government juntas in Sucre and La Paz, after the Chuquisaca Revolution and La Paz revolution. These Juntas were defeated shortly after, and the cities fell again under Spanish control. The May Revolution of 1810 ousted the viceroy in Buenos Aires, which established its own junta. Buenos Aires sent three large military expeditions to Upper Peru, headed by Juan José Castelli, Manuel Belgrano and José Rondeau, but the royalists ultimately prevailed over each one. However, the conflict grew into a guerrilla war, the War of the Republiquetas, preventing the royalists from strengthening their presence. After Simón Bolívar and Antonio José de Sucre defeated the royalists in northern South America, Sucre led a campaign that was to defeat the royalists in Charcas for good when the last royalist general, Pedro Antonio Olañeta, suffered death and defeat at the hands of his own defected forces at the Battle of Tumusla. Bolivian independence was proclaimed on 6 August 1825.

==The Colonial Governing Power and the Causes of the War==
Charcas (modern day Bolivia) is also sometimes referred to as the Upper Peru. This region fell under the authority of Spanish colonial rule in the sixteenth century. It was originally placed directly under the rule of the Viceroyalty of Peru, however this location proved to be too distant for effective control so Phillip II established the Audiencia of Charcas, which was an autonomous governing body under the purview of the viceroy of Peru. This governing was composed of &quot;oidores&quot; or judges and a governor with the title of president of the Audiencia. The Audiencia was given authority to make final decisions when a viceroy was unavailable or absent. 

The Audiencia was centered in Chuquisaca, which started out as an indigenous community and later became known by its post-independence name, Sucre. This was the center of administration as well as cultural activities for Charcas. The Archbishop of Charcas lived there and one of the prominent universities in Bolivia, was founded there. The Audiencia was a great honor for the Charcas. &quot;Oidores&quot; mostly came directly from Spain and tended to be very proud, often making everyone bow to them. They were also incredibly ignorant about the peoples&#x27; needs and problems. As Spanish settlements expanded to the south, the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Charcas grew to include not only present day Bolivia, but also Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and even parts of Peru. In 1776, the Audiencia of Charcas was placed under the authority of the viceroy of Buenos Aires in the newly created Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and most trade was redirected to Buenos Aires. This change was against Peruvian desires because they had wanted to keep Charcas for its enormous wealth in the mines of Potosí. For the next few decades, the question of the political and economic ties with Charcas was constantly fought over by Peru and Río de la Plata. On 25 May 1809, the citizens of Sucre participated in the first outbreak that was part of the initiation of the war of independence in Bolivia.

In 1784 the Spanish rulers created the intendancy system. Four main intendancies were constructed in La Paz, Cochabamba, Potosí, and Chuquisaca. This system gave authority to a few, skillful and educated men who were directly responsible to the King of Spain. This system was implemented to increase revenue as well as to stop specific problems that had resulted from other authorities misusing their power. The system consequently limited the power of the Audiencia.

The Bolivian people were divided into three main categories: Criollos, Mestizos, and the indigenous population. In authority over all of these people were the Peninsulares, who were influential people who had come from Spain to assume a leadership position in the church or government, in one of the Spanish colonies. All the rest of the Bolivian people had a social status beneath this elite class. The Criollos were people of pure Spanish descent who had been born in Latin America. The Criollos were envious of the power the Peninsulares held, and this attitude formed part of the basis for the War of Independence. Beneath the Criollos on the social hierarchy were the Mestizos, who were a mix of Spanish and Indigenous descent. The main reason these two people mixed was because of the lack of Spanish women in the region. Finally, at the bottom of the hierarchy was the biggest social class, the indigenous people, who primarily spoke Aymara and Quechua. These people often did not know what was going on politically in the country. However they offered a large force of fighting men for both the patriots and the royalists in the war. Nevertheless, in the War of Independence they proved to be very unpredictable and would, at times, turn on the army at any provocation. These people would generally fight for whoever controlled that area, whether loyalists, patriots, or royalists. The majority of the time it was the &quot;Republiquetas&quot; who controlled the rural areas where the Natives lived. Although they would fight for whomever, these people favored the patriots because they were part native, whereas the other armies were of pure Spanish descent. The real intention of the Indigenous people was to reestablish the Incan empire and so they wanted a form of government different from all three of the other groups. These groups all contended for the Natives&#x27; assistance in order to win the war; however not one army ever thought of liberating these people.

Independence was not a new idea in the minds of the people of the Charcas. This concept had begun to take root long before and already signs of discontent with the current form of government were beginning to show. The individuals in every class of the Bolivian population had become dissatisfied - the Criollos, the Mestizos, as well as the Indigenous people. They were all feeling the effects of increased Spanish taxes and trade restrictions. Indigenous rebellions started in 1730 in Cochabamba and others followed in the decades to come. Although most of the people were unhappy, the different social classes were not unified in their solution to the dilemma. The indigenous people wanted to do away with all the Spanish people and set up an Andean Utopia, whereas the Criollos simply desired more freedom from Spain. Because the Criollos bore racial prejudice against the Native population, those two groups of people did not unite against Spain.

Many revolutionary ideas spread from the university in Chuquisaca. In the early 1780s different students in the university distributed pamphlets in Charcas. These were written against Spanish authority and in them public officials were even called thieves. The ideas of independence really stemmed from Aquinas, a church father, who wrote about politics. He taught that if a ruler is cruel and tyrannical the people have a right to rebel and fight against their own government. The ruler should be under the Pope, thus the people can rebel against the King but not against God. There was not one main leader of the Revolutionaries or Radicals. Nevertheless, three main men were influential in this circle: Jaime Zudañez, Manuel Zudañez, and Bernardo Monteagudo. Jaime Zudañez was part of the Audiencia in the department of the defense of the poor. He would try to influence the decisions the Audiencia made and no one suspected his treasonous behavior. Manuel Zudeñez, his brother, was in the government as well and held an important position in the university in Chuquisaca. Finally Bernardo Monteagudo was a writer from a poor family but had an impact on the people through his whispering campaigns. All three of these men were in favor of doing away with the president, Ramón García León de Pizarro.

==The juntas of 1809==
During the Peninsular War which took place in Spain, Charcas (today Bolivia) closely followed the reports that arrived describing the rapidly evolving political situation in Spain, which led the Peninsula to near anarchy. The sense of uncertainty was heightened by the fact that news of 17 March Mutiny of Aranjuez and 6 May 1808 abdication of Ferdinand VII in favor of Joseph Bonaparte arrived within a month of each other, on 21 August and 17 September, respectively. In the confusion that followed, various juntas in Spain and Portuguese Princess Carlotta, sister of Ferdinand VII, in Brazil claimed authority over the Americas.

On 11 November, the representative of the Junta of Seville, José Manuel de Goyeneche, arrived in Chuquisaca, after stopping in Buenos Aires, with instructions to secure Charcas&#x27; recognition of authority of the Seville Junta. He also brought with him a letter from Princess Carlotta requesting the recognition of her right to rule in her brother&#x27;s absence. The President-Intendant Ramón García León de Pizarro, backed by the Archbishop of Chuquisaca Benito María de Moxó y Francolí, was inclined to recognize the Seville Junta, but the mostly Peninsular Audiencia of Charcas, in its function as a privy council for the President (the &quot;real acuerdo&quot;), felt it would be hasty to recognize either one. A fist fight almost broke between the senior oidor and Goyeneche over the issue, but the &quot;oidores&quot;&#x27; opinion prevailed. The Radicals or Revolutionaries supported the &quot;Audiencia&#x27;s&quot; decision because it put the power more into the hands of the people in Latin America as well as because it was a &quot;temporary&quot; split with Spain during this time of tribulation in the land of Spain. Over the next few weeks García León and Moxó became convinced that recognizing Carlotta might be the best way to preserve the unity of the empire, but this was unpopular with the majority of Charcasvians and the Audiencia. The President and the Archbishop grew very unpopular with the &quot;oidores&quot; because the archbishop informed the people of all the news that arrived from Spain. The &quot;Audiencia&quot; wanted to conceal the information in order to not acknowledge their own weaknesses. During this time the Catholic Church in Charcas split from the &quot;Audiencia&quot; because of the tension between Moxó and the &quot;Oidores&quot;.

On 26 May 1809, the Audiencia &quot;oidores&quot; received rumors that García León de Pizarro planned to arrest them in order to recognize Carlotta. The Audiencia decided that the situation had become so anarchic both in Charcas and in the Peninsula, that Charcas needed to take the government into its own hands. It removed García León de Pizarro from office and transformed itself into a junta, which ruled in Fernando&#x27;s name, just as cities and provinces had done in Spain a year earlier. A second junta was established in La Paz on 16 July by Criollos who took over the local barracks and deposed both the intendant and bishop of La Paz. The La Paz junta clearly broke with any authority in Spain and with the authorities in Buenos Aires. José de la Serna, the Spanish Viceroy in Lima dispatched five thousand soldiers led by none other than Goyeneche, who had become the president of &quot;Audiencia&quot; in Cuzco. The rebels were defeated and the leaders of the movement were hanged or sentenced to imprisonment for life. The &quot;Audiencia&quot; had to beg for mercy as well as make an agreement with the Royalists so that the city of Chuquisaca would not be left in ruin by the army. This rebellion was stopped, however the yearning for freedom was far from extinguished. After Buenos Aires successfully established a junta in May 1810, Charcas came under the control of the Viceroyalty of Peru and managed to fight off several attempts to take over it militarily.

The Peninsulares had very divided opinions regarding which form of government was that best and what claims from Spain were actually true, thus they unconsciously left room for other groups to take the initiative for the future of Charcas. The Criollos were excited about this break between the President and the &quot;Audiencia&quot; because they took it as an excellent opportunity to gain the power they had always craved but never obtained because of the Spanish government. These upper class Criollos were divided into three main sections. The first one was very influenced by the Peninsulares and so did not desire anything to change. The second sector longed for an independent government. The final group was made up of the Radicals who wanted an independent government, not to solely accomplish that end, but to bring about deeper social reforms. The middle class Criollos as well as the Mestizos did not actively participate in expressing their opinions because they lacked leadership but were very attentive to all that was happening during the war.

==The &quot;republiquetas&quot;==

From 1810 to 1824, the idea of independence was kept alive by six guerrilla bands that formed in the backcountry of Charcas. The areas they controlled are called &quot;republiquetas&quot; (&quot;petty republics&quot;) in the historiography of Bolivia. The &quot;republiquetas&quot; were located in the Lake Titicaca region, Mizque, Vallegrande, Ayopaya, the countryside around Sucre, the southern region near today&#x27;s Argentina and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The &quot;republiquetas&quot; were led by caudillos whose power was based on their personality and ability to win military engagements. This allowed them to create quasi-states which attracted varied followers, ranging from political exiles of the main urban centers to cattle rustlers and other fringe members of Criollo and Mestizo society. These Criollo and Mestizo &quot;republiquetas&quot; often allied themselves with the local Indian communities, although it was not always possible to keep the Natives&#x27; loyalty, since their own material and political interests often eclipsed the idea of regional independence. Ultimately the &quot;republiquetas&quot; never had the size nor organization to actually bring about the independence of Charcas, but instead maintained a fifteen-year stalemate with royalist regions, while holding off attempts by Buenos Aires to control the area. Most of these quasi states were so isolated that they had no knowledge that the others even existed.

During the time of the &quot;Republiquetas&quot; the radicals in Argentina had succeeded in winning the independence of the country on 25 May 1810. Since Charcas was included in the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata the radicals were interested in freeing Charcas as well. The citizens of Charcas showed their support of this through an uprising against the Royalists. Three armies were sent over from Argentina from 1810 to 1817. The first army sent was led by Juan José Castelli. After his victory at Suipacha, he arrested the president of the &quot;Audiencia&quot;, the intendant of Potosí, as well as a Royalist general. The people protested against this act because these people were respected in the community although they were on the opposing side. Castelli did not heed their plead but executed them anyway because they would not submit to Argentina. The Argentinian army looted, stole, killed, and misused the citizens of Potosí. They not only disrespected the women there, they also killed those who attempted to stop this behavior. Eventually they left to go conquer Chuquisaca. Castelli went from city to city in Charcas freeing the people from Royalist forces, but destroying the cities and mistreating its citizens in the process. Despite all of this, he did try to make reforms to free the indigenous and improve their quality of life. He finally arrived at the border of Viceroyalty of Lima and stopped and made a treaty with Goyeneche, yet he did not respect the treaty and kept expanding. Therefore, on 20 June 1811, Goyeneche attacked Castelli&#x27;s army in Huaqui, south of Titicaca lake, causing them to flee back toward Argentina. They were forced to bypass Oruro and other cities because the people there wanted revenge for the trouble they had caused. Goyeneche did not continue pursuing Castelli&#x27;s army, but instead paused and cared for all the wounded. Castelli nonetheless, was eventually run out of the country and the Royalists took control.&lt;br&gt; 
Two more auxiliary armies from Argentina followed but both were eventually defeated.
Manuel Belgrano led the Second Upper Peru campaign (1812–1813), but was defeated in the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma. A third campaign in 1815 was also repelled after a crushing defeat in the Battle of Sipe-Sipe.

The areas of Charcas which remained under royalist control elected a representative to the Cortes of Cádiz, Mariano Rodríguez Olmedo, who served from 4 May 1813, to 5 May 1814. Rodríguez Olmedo was a conservative representative, signing the 1814 request, known as the &quot; Manifesto of the Persians&quot;&quot; (&quot;Manifiesto de los Persas&quot;), by seventy Cortes delegates to Ferdinand VII to repeal the Spanish Constitution of 1812.}

==Independence consolidated==
Meanwhile, Simón Bolívar, who is considered by some to be the Napoleon of South America, and José de San Martín were endeavoring to free the surrounding territories in Latin America. San Martín, who was originally from Argentina, had liberated Chile and then moved on to Peru. San Martín believed that to eliminate Spanish rule in Latin America they had to defeat the Royalists in Peru. Charcas was then under the Viceroyalty of Lima and thus liberating Peru would lead to the liberation of Charcas as well. Therefore, because of this strong conviction that as long as Spain controlled the seas they would have a foothold on the continent, he created a fleet led by Lord Cochrane, who had joined the Chilean service in 1819. San Martín took over Lima in July 1821 and declared Peruvian independence. There, San Martín encountered much resistance from the Royalists who remained. During that time, his army began to crumple because of disease as well as soldiers abandoning the army. San Martín was left with no choice but to beg Bolívar for his help. Although Bolívar and San Martín met in Guayaquil, they could not agree on the form of government that should be established for the liberated countries, and so both went on their separate ways for the time being. San Martín returned to Peru, only to face a revolution in Lima that had started because the men left behind were incapable of governing the country. He resigned from his position as Protector of Peru, discouraged. Bolívar was convinced that it was his duty to rid the continent of the Spanish, and so journeyed to Lima. When he arrived on 1 September 1823, he immediately took command.

The fight for independence gained new impetus after the 9 December 1824 Battle of Ayacucho, in which a combined army of 5,700 Gran Colombian and Peruvian troops under the command of Antonio José de Sucre defeated the royalist army of 6,500 and captured its leader, the Viceroy José de la Serna.

However, Royalist armies still remained, which were the stronghold at El Callao and the army of General Olañeta in Charcas. The army at El Callao was contained and besieged by the Peruvian army, but Olañeta&#x27;s army proved to be more difficult to eliminate. Olañeta was rumored to have planned to surrender Charcas to Brazil in 1824 in order to keep the country under Spanish control. He had asked for Brazil to send over an army; however, the governor of Brazil refused to become involved. Bolívar and San Martín both desired to make an agreement with Olañeta because he had helped them in the battle of Ayacucho. Sucre, Bolívar&#x27;s most successful general, did not trust Olañeta and so despite his plan to make peace, he started to occupy Charcas. Sucre prepared to persuade this Royalist general, either with words or by force. Bolívar assumed that Olañeta would take a long time deciding what to do and planned to travel to Charcas during that time. However, Olañeta had planned one more sudden attack. Sucre invited the men of Charcas to join him and in January 1825, a large number of men from Olañeta&#x27;s army deserted him and joined Sucre. On 9 March, Sucre had succeeded in capturing every Royalist general there except for Olañeta. Yet this fierce general refused to surrender. Finally on 13 April, part Olañeta&#x27;s forces joined the patriots and mutinied. Olañeta was fatally wounded in the ensuing Battle of Tumusla. At last, Spain had relinquished its grip on South America, the final battles being fought in Charcas.

The Marshal Sucre called this city &quot;the cradle of American Independence.&quot; The reason for this statement was that La Paz was the first place people were murdered for the desire for independence and now, decades later, the last Royalist forces had been defeated. What remained of the royalist forces dissolved because of mutiny and desertion. On 25 April 1825, Sucre arrived in Chuquisaca, which had been the hub of Spanish dominion. The citizens of the city rejoiced, gathering along the road. The town council, clergy, and the university students all congregated at the edge of Chuquisaca to greet Sucre. The people even went as far as preparing a Roman chariot pulled by twelve maidens dressed in blue and white to pull Sucre into the heart of the city.

Sucre called a meeting on 10 July in Chuquisaca to decide the fate of the country of Charcas. There were three options that the committee could decide from. Charcas could unite with Argentina, unite with Peru, or become independent. Bolívar&#x27;s desire was for Charcas to unite with Peru; however, the council was in favor of becoming an independent nation. Although they did not all vote for this, all signed the declaration of independence on 6 August 1825. Although no one disputes that Bolivia was named after Bolívar, there are differences in opinion over why that actually happened. Some historians say that it is because the people were afraid Bolívar would be against the vote because Bolívar wanted Charcas to join Peru. Because of this, they proceeded to name the newly formed country after him to appease him. The Bolivian population still celebrates Bolívar&#x27;s birthday as a national holiday to honor him. Bolívar was president for five months, during which time he reduced taxes, and reformed the land organization to aid the indigenous population. He left Sucre as president when he returned to govern the North. Sucre attempted to reduce the taxes that the indigenous were forced to pay. However, this plan failed because without it, he was not able to support the Gran Colombian Army which stopped the Argentinians from invading Bolivia again. Thus, the system remained in place.

From then on, local elites dominated the congress and although they supported Sucre&#x27;s efforts, they chafed under the idea that a Gran Colombian army remained in the nation. After an attempt on his life, Sucre resigned the presidency of Bolivia in April 1828 and returned to Venezuela. The Bolivian Congress elected La Paz native Andrés de Santa Cruz as the new president. Santa Cruz had been a former royalist officer, served under José de San Martín after 1821 and then under Sucre in Ecuador, and had a short term as president of Peru from 1826 to 1827. Santa Cruz arrived in Bolivia in May 1829 and assumed office. Independence did not provide solidarity to the nation. For six decades afterward, the country had feeble and short governing institutions.

==Brief annexation by the Province of Mato Grosso==
Spain, which betrayed Portugal in 1807 (its ally until then) to ally with France, saw himself betrayed by Napoleon, who imprisoned the Spanish royal family and nominated his brother, José Bonaparte, as King of Spain, title unrecognized by the population which resisted the French occupation. Thus, with the political vacuum created by the absence of its King, that is, by the absence of a central government, the Spanish Empire started to dismantle itself.

Independence movements started to surge in all Hispanic America, spreading war and chaos. In face of this sensation of unsafety and fearing the chaos, in June 1822, the three governors of the Spanish departments of Upper Peru (which had already being threatened by the troops of General Antonio Jose de Sucre and Simon Bolivar), reunited in Cuiaba (Capital of the Captaincy of Mato Grosso / Brazil) and solicited the governor that he interceded along with the Prince Regent Dom Pedro (that soon would be crowned as Dom Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil), in order that the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves annexed these territories, seeking to spare its population from the massacre and the chaos.

Immediately, the governor of Mato Grosso sent troops that were by his captaincy to the Upper Peru, blocking the advance of Bolivar and Sucre, and sent a letter to Dom Pedro, communicating him about the sending of troops and the solicitation of the authorities of Upper Peru (that later on would become Bolivia). Letter which was only received by Dom Pedro I in November 1822, when Brazil was already an independent nation. Besides, Bolivar and Sucre were quicker and sent representatives to the City of Rio de Janeiro, which came before the governor&#x27;s letter. In this way, when the Prince Regent received the letter he had already decided not to annex Upper Peru, rejecting the solicitation from the governors of the region and ordering that the troops were removed from there.

With this, Dom Pedro I left the region of Upper Peru (modern Bolivia) up to its own luck, what culminated with the invasion of the Bolivar and Sucre troops and the Bolivian independence from Spain.

Clearly at that moment, Dom Pedro I was more worried in defeating the resistance of the liberal Portuguese troops on Brazilian soil, guaranteeing Brazilian unity. However, without this decision being made Bolivian territory may have been integrated into Brazil.

<text>Ayrshire and Arran is a lieutenancy area of Scotland. It consists of the council areas of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. The area of Ayrshire and Arran is also a brand for tourist attractions.

The area has joint electoral, valuation and health boards. For electoral and valuation purposes, the same area is simply called Ayrshire.

==History==
The lieutenancy area was created in 1975 when the historic county of Ayrshire was abolished for local government purposes. The last Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire was made the first lord-lieutenant of a new lieutenancy area covering the four districts of Cumnock and Doon Valley, Cunninghame, Kilmarnock and Loudoun, and Kyle and Carrick. This area corresponded to the historic county of Ayrshire plus the Isle of Arran and The Cumbraes from Buteshire. The lieutenancy area was not given a separate name, with the lord-lieutenant being described as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Lord-Lieutenant in Strathclyde Region (Districts of Cunninghame, Kilmarnock and Loudoun, Kyle and Carrick and Cumnock and Doon Valley).&quot;

Further local government reform in 1996 saw the four districts within the lieutenancy area reorganised and renamed to become the three council areas of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire, and South Ayrshire. The lieutenancy area remained unchanged, but was named &quot;Ayrshire and Arran&quot;, with the post holder thereafter being called the Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire and Arran.

<doc id="554192" wikidata="Q3348205" url="?curid=554192" title="Mohammad Sami">
<text>Mohammad Sami (; born 24 February 1981) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer who played for the Pakistan national cricket team between 2001 and 2016.

==Domestic career==
Sami joined the Indian Cricket League following the tour of India in December 2007. He played for the Lahore Badshahs, a team composed entirely of Pakistani cricketers, during the Indian Cricket League&#x27;s second Twenty20 tournament. His participation in the league meant that he, like many other Pakistan players, was banned from representing his country at both international level and domestic cricket in Pakistan.

Sami was bought by Islamabad United for US$50,000 in the Pakistan Super League. He finished the season as the 2nd highest wicket-taker for his team and 4th overall in the tournament with 12 wickets in 7 matches. 
He was retained by Islamabad United in 2017 season again finishing the season as 2nd highest wicket-taker for his team. He is the second leading wicket-taker with 24 wickets in 16 matches.

In 2013, Sami was retained by the BPL team, Duronto Rajshahi to play as the main fast bowler, but cause of disagreements between PCB and BCB no Pakistani player (including Sami) was allowed to play in the BPL. This was a big loss for Duronto, because Sami was the highest wicket-taker last season.

He was signed by Jamaica Tallawahs for the 2017 Caribbean Premier League. He was then picked by St Lucia Stars for the 2018 Caribbean Premier League.

He was the leading wicket-taker for Karachi Whites in the 2017–18 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 28 dismissals in five matches.

In April 2018, he was named in Punjab&#x27;s squad for the 2018 Pakistan Cup. In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Rajshahi Kings team, following the draft for the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League. In March 2019, he was named in Punjab&#x27;s squad for the 2019 Pakistan Cup.

== International career ==
===Golden years===
Sami, initially named as the modern Malcolm Marshall by Imran Khan, made his Test cricket debut against New Zealand in 2001 by taking 8 wickets for 106 runs in the match, including five wickets in the second innings. During his third Test match he achieved a hat-trick against Sri Lanka and in 2002 he took his second hat-trick in his career, against the West Indies during a One Day International match. This led to him becoming one of only a two bowlers in cricket (the other was Wasim Akram) to achieve this mark in both forms of the game. He also displayed excellent performances against Zimbabwe and New Zealand in 2003. On 1 December 2003, he achieved his best bowling figures in One Day International cricket by taking 5 wickets for 10 runs during a match. Earlier in April during that year in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, he had taken 4 wickets for 25 runs against Kenya during the match. Sami played his 50th One Day International match against India at Lahore in Pakistan on 24 March 2004.

He has also taken over 100 wickets in First-class cricket and in List A cricket.

===Loss of form===
Sami also earned the ignominy of bowling the longest over in One Day International cricket during the Asia Cup match against Bangladesh in 2004, when he bowled 17 balls in one over which consisted of seven wides and four no-balls. He is also the only bowler in Test cricket history to have over 50 wickets and a bowling average of 50.

After losing form and failing to achieve success for the Pakistan cricket team, the Pakistan Cricket Board and its national selectors replaced Sami for the One Day International series against England with fellow fast bowler Mohammad Asif. However he was recalled for the series against South Africa in 2007. He was selected in the 15-man Pakistan squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, although he was named as one of five reserves. After teammates Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were dropped from the World Cup squad, since neither of the two had been declared fit and they had not undergone official doping tests, Sami and Yasir Arafat were called up as replacements.

===Comeback===
In 2009–2010, he was recalled back to the Pakistan team and on 3 January 2010, during Pakistan&#x27;s Test match series against Australia, he played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia and took 3 wickets for 27 runs in the first innings of the second Test match. On 19 April he was selected in the Pakistan squad as one of the replacements for the injured fast bowlers Umar Gul and Yasir Arafat, in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament held in the West Indies.

Sami was recalled and played against South Africa in the middle east in November 2010. In May 2012 Sami received another recall and was announced in the squad that toured Sri Lanka in June 2012, because of his amazing performances in the Bangladesh premier league (which included a hat trick and a 5-wicket haul). He bowled brilliantly in the 2nd T20I.

Following that, in the 1st ODI he bowled economically and with pace, which earned him a place in the 15-man squad to play the touring Australians and also the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. Sami was selected for these international tours, but didn&#x27;t get to play an official game (he got to play two warm up matches), as Pakistan made it to the semi-finals, but lost to Sri-lanka.

In May 2015, Sami was selected for the T20I side that is going to play Zimbabwe in Lahore. This happened after impressive performances in the Faysal Bank T20I cup. Sami made comeback in the home series against Zimbabwe. In his comeback match, Mohammad Sami took three wickets for Pakistan. Sami has been included in Pakistan squad for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 as a result of strong performances in the BPL, the PSL &amp; the Asia Cup where he bowled accurately at more than 140 km/h on a consistent basis.

==Bowling action==
Sami has a quick arm action and he is regarded as one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket and has the ability to swing the cricket ball at high pace. He has unofficially bowled the fastest delivery in cricket when he clocked at 164 km/h (101.9 mph) during a One Day International match. However, it was revoked by cricket officials after it found faulty speed measurements on the speed meter. However, despite his speed, he has been in and out of the national side for several times. However he has received support from 2 former Pakistan captains Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who both saw Sami&#x27;s speed and wicket taking ability as an important skill for the Pakistan team.

==Coaching career==
In September 2022, he was appointed bowling coach to the Mardan Warriors squad for the inaugural season of the Pakistan Junior League.

==Cricket administration==
In February 2023, he became a member of Haroon Rasheed&#x27;s national selection committee.

<text>Izola (; ) is a town in southwestern Slovenia on the Adriatic coast of the Littoral traditional region. It is the seat of the Municipality of Izola and is one of the three major towns of Slovenian Istria.

==Name==
Izola was attested in written sources as &quot;Insula&quot; in 972 and 977, and as &quot;Insulle&quot; in 1281. The name &quot;Izola&quot; is borrowed from Italian &quot;Isola&quot;, literally &#x27;island&#x27;, referring to the fact that the town center is a former island that was artificially connected with the mainland at the beginning of the 19th century.

==History== 

An ancient Roman port and settlement known as Haliaetum stood to the southwest of the present town, next to the village of Jagodje, as early as the 2nd century BC. The town of Izola was established on a small island by refugees from Aquileia in the 7th century. The coastal areas of Istria came under Venetian influence in the 9th century. The settlement was first mentioned in writing as &quot;Insula&quot; in a Venetian document entitled Liber albus in 932 AD. It became definitely the territory of the Republic of Venice in 1267, and the centuries of Venetian rule left a strong and enduring mark on the region. The Venetian part of the peninsula passed to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1797 with the Treaty of Campo Formio, until the period of Napoleonic rule from 1805 to 1813 when Istria became part of the Illyrian provinces of the Napoleonic Empire. After this short period, during which Izola&#x27;s walls were torn down and used to fill in the channel that separated the island from the mainland, the newly established Austrian Empire ruled Istria until November 1918. The treaty of Saint Germain assigned Izola and the rest of the Istria region to Italy. The Italian-speaking population was the majority according to the Austro-Hungarian census of 1900: of 5,363 inhabitants, 5,326 spoke Italian, 20 Slovene, and 17 German. Istria became part of the Kingdom of Italy, until Italian capitulation in September 1943, whereupon control passed to Germany. Izola was liberated by a naval unit from Koper at the end of April 1945. After the end of World War II, Izola was part of Zone B of the provisionally independent Free Territory of Trieste; after the &quot;de facto&quot; dissolution of the Free Territory in 1954 it was incorporated into Slovenia, then a part of Yugoslavia. The newly defined Italo-Yugoslav border saw the migration of many people from one side to the other. In Izola&#x27;s case, many Italian speakers emigrated, and in their place Slovenian-speaking people from neighbouring villages settled in the town.

In 1820, a thermal spring was discovered in Izola, leading to the town&#x27;s earliest forms of tourism. Between 1902 and 1935 the Parenzana, a narrow-gauge railway line, connected the town to Trieste and Poreč (known as &quot;Parenzo&quot; until 1947).

<text>Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale (&quot;Rosbrog, Eadaraig agus Srath Labhdair&quot; in Scottish Gaelic) is a lieutenancy area of Scotland. The lieutenancy area was created on 1 April 1996, when local government was reorganised across Scotland under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. The lieutenancy area covers the combined area of the two abolished local government districts of Roxburgh and Ettrick and Lauderdale, which had been nominally separate lieutenancy areas prior to 1996, although both lieutenancies were held by John Scott, 9th Duke of Buccleuch. The lieutenancy area broadly corresponds to the historic counties of Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire, plus small parts of Midlothian and Berwickshire.

<text>Ptuj (; , ; ) is the eighth-largest town of Slovenia, located in the traditional region of Styria (northeastern Slovenia). It is the seat of the Municipality of Ptuj. Being the oldest recorded city in Slovenia, it has been inhabited since the late Stone Age and developed from a Roman military fort, located at a strategically important crossing of the Drava River along a prehistoric trade route between the Baltic Sea and the Adriatic.

==History==
===Early history===
Ptuj is the oldest recorded town in Slovenia. There is evidence that the area was settled in the Stone Age. In the Late Iron Age it was settled by Celts.

===First mentions===
By the 1st century BC, the settlement was controlled by Ancient Rome as part of the Pannonian province. In 69 AD, Vespasian was elected Roman Emperor by the Danubian legions in Ptuj, and the first written mention of the city of Ptuj is from the same year. &quot;Poetovium&quot; was the base-camp of Legio XIII &quot;Gemina&quot; where it had its legionary fortress or &quot;castrum&quot;. The name originated in the times of Emperor Trajan, who granted the settlement city status and named it &quot;Colonia Ulpia Traiana Poetovio&quot; in 103. The patristic writer Victorinus was Bishop of Poetovio before his martyrdom in 303 or 304. The Caesar Constantius Gallus was divested of his imperial robe and arrested in Poetovio before his subsequent execution in Pola (354) (Amm.Marc. Hist. XIV) The battle of Poetovio in 388 saw Theodosius I&#x27;s victory over the usurper, Maximus.

The city had 40,000 inhabitants until it was plundered by the Huns in 450.

===Middle Ages===
In 570 the city was occupied by Eurasian Avars and Slavic tribes. Ptuj became part of the Frankish Empire after the fall of the Avar state at the end of 8th century. Between 840 and 874 it belonged to the Slavic Balaton Principality of Pribina and Kocelj. Between 874 and 890 Ptuj gradually came under the influence of the Archbishopric of Salzburg which had both spiritual and temporal rule over the town; city rights passed in 1376 began an economic upswing for the settlement.

===Habsburg Monarchy and Austria-Hungary===
After the re-establishment of the Habsburg rule in 1490, following Matthias Corvinus&#x27;s conquests, the Archbishop of Salzburg was stripped of the remaining temporal authority over the town and the surrounding areas; Ptuj (known in German as Pettau) was officially incorporated into the Duchy of Styria in 1555.

Pettau was a battleground during the Ottoman wars in Europe and suffered from fires in 1684, 1705, 1710, and 1744. Its population and importance began to decline in the 19th century, however, after the completion of the Vienna-Trieste route of the Austrian Southern Railway, as the line went through Marburg (Maribor) instead.

According to the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, 86% of the population of Pettau&#x27;s Old Town was German-speaking, while the population of the surrounding villages predominantly spoke Slovenian. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, Pettau was included in the short-lived Republic of German Austria.

===Establishment of Yugoslavia===
After the military intervention of the Slovenian general Rudolf Maister, the entire territory of Lower Styria was included into the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (Yugoslavia). During the interwar period, the number and the percentage of those identifying as Germans in the city, which was renamed Ptuj, decreased rapidly, although a relatively strong ethnic German minority remained.

===World War II===
After the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Ptuj was occupied by Nazi Germany. From 1941 to 1944 the town&#x27;s Slovenian population was dispossessed and deported. Their homes were taken over by German speakers from South Tyrol and Gottschee County, who had themselves been evicted according to an agreement between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. These German immigrants, along with the native German &quot;Pettauer&quot;, were expelled to Austria in 1945; many later settled in North America.

Since 1945, Ptuj has been populated almost completely by Slovenes.

==Culture==
===The Kurent or Korant Carnival===
Ptuj is the center place of a ten-day-long carnival in the spring, an ancient Slavic pagan rite of spring and fertility, called Kurentovanje or Korantovanje. Kurent is believed to be the name of an ancient god of hedonism - the Slavic counterpart of the Greek god Priapos, although there are no written records.

Kurent or Korant is a figure dressed in sheep skin who goes about the town wearing a mask, a long red tongue, cowbells, and multi-colored ribbons on its head. The Kurent(s) from Ptuj and the adjoining villages also wear feathers, while those from the Haloze and Lancova Vas wear horns. Organized in groups, Kurents go through town, from house to house, making noise with their bells and wooden sticks, to symbolically scare off evil spirits and the winter.

==Landmarks==

The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint George and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It is a three-naved Gothic building from the 13th and early 14th century, but the structure incorporates parts of a much earlier structure, dating to the mid-9th century.

<doc id="554199" wikidata="Q15407579" url="?curid=554199" title="Unborn Victims of Violence Act">
<text>The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-212) is a United States law that recognizes a &quot;child in utero&quot; as a legal victim, if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence. The law defines this term, “child in utero&quot; as &quot;a member of the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.&quot;

The law is codified in two sections of the United States Code: Title 18, Chapter 1 (Crimes), §1841 (18 USC 1841) and Title 10, Chapter 22 (Uniform Code of Military Justice) §919a (Article 119a). The law applies only to certain offenses over which the United States government has jurisdiction, including certain crimes committed on federal properties, against certain federal officials and employees, and by members of the military. In addition, it covers certain crimes that are defined by statute as federal offenses wherever they occur, no matter who commits them, such as certain crimes of terrorism. Due to the principles of federalism embodied in the United States Constitution, federal criminal law does not apply to crimes prosecuted by the individual U.S. states, although 38 states also recognize the fetus or &quot;unborn child&quot; as a crime victim, at least for purposes of homicide or feticide.

The legislation was both hailed and vilified by various legal observers who interpreted the measure as a step toward granting legal personhood to human fetuses, even though the bill explicitly contained a provision excepting abortion, stating that the bill would not &quot;be construed to permit the prosecution... of any person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf&quot;, &quot;of any person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child&quot; or &quot;of any woman with respect to her unborn child&quot;. The reluctance of a federal law to authorize federal prosecution of a particular act committed under federal jurisdiction does not prevent states from passing their own laws against the act committed under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the definition of all unborn babies as &quot;members of the species homo sapiens&quot; in section (d) says what proposed &quot;personhood&quot; laws say. Sponsors of such proposals say such legal language will trigger the collapse clause in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, by establishing what they suggest &quot;Roe&quot; said must be established for legal abortion to end. Several state supreme courts have ruled that sections (a) through (c) are not threatened by Roe, but, by the time it was overturned by the Supreme Court, no court had ever addressed whether &quot;Roe&quot; could survive the suggested triggering of its collapse clause by section (d).

The legislation was originally advocated by Senator Lindsey Graham, then later on the legislation was introduced in the house as H.R. 1997 by Melissa Hart in May 7, 2003. The enactment of the legislation was found to be essential, since it would make it a separate offense to harm a fetus.

The legislation contained the alternate title of Laci and Conner&#x27;s Law after the California mother (Laci Peterson) and fetus (Conner Peterson) whose deaths were widely publicized during the later stages of the congressional debate on the bill in 2003 and 2004. Her husband Scott Peterson was convicted of double homicide under California&#x27;s fetal homicide law.

==Legislative History==

The Unborn Victims of Violence Act was first introduced in Congress in 1999 by then-Congressman (later Senator) Lindsey Graham (R-SC). It passed the House of Representatives in 1999 and 2001, but not the Senate. In 2003, the bill was reintroduced in the House as H.R. 1997 by Rep. Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania. 

Prior to enactment of the federal law, the fetus in utero was, as a general rule, not recognized as a victim of federal crimes of violence. Thus, in a federal crime that injured a pregnant woman and killed the fetus in utero, no homicide was recognized, in most cases. 

=== House Committee Action ===
The House Judiciary Committee approved the legislation known as HR 1997 on January 31, 2003. During the debate the Committee rejected an 11-9 vote on an amendment that was to create a separate offense for federal crimes against pregnant women but without recognizing fetuses as separate entities. The Committee also rejected an 11-20 amendment to specify that nothing in the bill &quot;shall be constructed as undermining a women&#x27;s right to choose an abortion as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution or limiting in any way the rights and freedoms of pregnant women.&quot; Furthermore, the Committee also rejected by voice vote two amendments in which would have directed the federal sentencing commission to amend sentencing guidelines for crimes that injury or death to a pregnant women and a rejection against deleting language in the bill that would have allowed convictions in cases where prosecutors did not show a defendant knew the victim or had the intention to cause death or injury to a fetus.

=== House Floor Action ===
The House passed the bill, 254-163 on February 26, 2004. Prior to this, the House rejected a substitute that did not include language that defined an &quot;unborn child.&quot; This would have also required that the defendant to be convicted of a federal crime against a pregnant woman prior to receiving additional consequences for harming a fetus. The legislation was co-sponsored by 136 other members of the House before it passed by a vote of 254 in favor to 163 against on February 26, 2004.

=== Senate Floor Action ===
The senate cleared the House Bill, 61-38, on March 25, 2004 after the Republicans succeeded in defeating two Democratic amendments. Bill Frist, Majority Leader, attempted to acknowledge a similar legislation to the Senate floor in July 2003 prohibiting amendments, however, the Democratic party objected. After several amendments were rejected, it was passed in the Senate by a vote of 61-38 on March 25, 2004. Following the Senate hearing, President George W. Bush signed the Legislation, which then became law on April 1, 2004.


==Signing==
At the signing ceremony, the President was joined on stage by men and women who had lost family members in two-victim crimes, including Laci Peterson&#x27;s mother, Sharon Rocha. During his remarks at the ceremony, Bush said, &quot;Any time an expectant mother is a victim of violence, two lives are in the balance, each deserving protection, and each deserving justice. If the crime is murder and the unborn child&#x27;s life ends, justice demands a full accounting under the law.&quot;

==Support==
Anti-abortion organizations strongly supported the act. On July 3, 2003, the U.S. Judiciary Committee heard testimony for and against passage of the UVVA. Feminists for Life president Serrin Foster submitted her own testimony, as well as that of Sharon Rocha. In addition, Foster argued against passage of an alternative bill by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, which would have provided &quot;additional punishment for certain crimes against women when the crimes cause an interruption in the normal course of their pregnancies&quot; but not treated the unborn child as a second victim. &quot;We are asking our elected representatives to honestly answer the question in the case of Laci Peterson and baby Conner,&quot; Foster asked. &quot;Was there one victim or two? Those who support the single-victim substitute would deny women justice.&quot;

==Opposition==
The Unborn Victims of Violence Act was strongly opposed by most abortion-rights organizations, on grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision said that the human fetus is not a &quot;person&quot; under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and that if the fetus were a Fourteenth Amendment &quot;person&quot;, then they would have a constitutional right to life. The laws of 38 states also recognize the human fetus as the legal victim of homicide and often, other violent crimes during the entire period of prenatal development (27 states) or during part of the prenatal period (nine states). Legal challenges to these laws, arguing that they violate &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; or other Supreme Court precedents, have been uniformly rejected by both the federal and the state courts, including the supreme courts of California, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.

Senator John Kerry, who was the Democratic nominee in the 2004 presidential election, voted against the bill, saying, &quot;I have serious concerns about this legislation because the law cannot simultaneously provide that a fetus is a human being and protect the right of the mother to choose to terminate her pregnancy.&quot;

Some prominent legal scholars who strongly support &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, such as Walter Dellinger of Duke University Law School, Richard Parker of Harvard, and Sherry F. Colb of Rutgers Law School, have written that fetal homicide laws do not conflict with &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

A principle that allows language in law to not conflict with Roe, which logically should trigger Roe&#x27;s &quot;collapse&quot; clause, was explained in &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot;, 492 US 490 (1989). Until such language becomes the basis for laws that specify penalties for abortion, the issue is not even before the court, of whether or not such language conflicts with &quot;Roe&quot;, and if so, which should be struck down.

Representative Jerrold Nadler made a statement in voicing his opposition to a proposed federal law giving prenatal entities certain legal rights. The bill appears to contradict an important premise behind the constitutional right to seek an abortion: prenatal entities are not persons.

==Provisions==
The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 protects unborn infants against violence and murder, and any individual responsible for the death or harm of a child in utero is charged separately from the offense towards the pregnant woman.

The operative portion of the law, now codified as Title 18, Section 1841 of the United States Code, reads as follows:

=== Section 1841 Addresses the protection of unborn children ===
Anyone who participates in activity that violates any of the provisions of law and causes the death or bodily harm as defined in section 1365 of a child who is in utero at the time the conduct occurs is guilty of a separate crime under this section. Provides that persons who commit certain Federal violent crimes conduct that violates specified provisions of the Federal criminal code, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or specified articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and thereby cause the death of, or bodily injury to, a child who is in utero shall be guilty of a separate offense.

* protection of unborn children which describes that any harm to a child in utero is an offense
* the punishment is the same for the conduct occurring to the unborn child’s mother. Requires the punishment for that separate offense to be the same as provided under Federal law for that conduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child&#x27;s mother
* It is not necessary to show that the offender meant to damage the unborn child or that they knew or should have known that the victim of the underlying conduct was pregnant
* A person cannot be prosecuted under this Act for:
** engaging in conduct related to an abortion for which the pregnant woman&#x27;s consent has been obtained or is implied by law;
** engaging in conduct related to the pregnant woman&#x27;s or her unborn child&#x27;s medical treatment.

=== Section 919a ===

* The law is enforced for any individual who causes death or injury of an unborn child in the utero at the time the conduct takes place, is to be guilty of a separate offense.
* Bars prosecution: of any person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman (or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf) has been obtained or is implied by law or for conduct relating to any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child.

<doc id="554207" wikidata="Q617409" url="?curid=554207" title="Argentine War of Independence">
<text>The Argentine War of Independence () was a secessionist civil war fought from 1810 to 1818 by Argentine patriotic forces under Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Martin Miguel de Guemes and José de San Martín against royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown. On July 9, 1816, an assembly met in San Miguel de Tucumán, declaring independence with provisions for a national constitution.

==Background==

The territory of modern Argentina was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, with its capital city in Buenos Aires, seat of government of the Spanish viceroy. Modern Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia were also part of the viceroyalty, and began their push for autonomy during the conflict, becoming independent states afterwards. The vast area of the territory and slow communications led most populated areas to become isolated from each other. The wealthiest regions of the viceroyalty were in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia). Salta and Córdoba had closer ties with Upper Peru than with Buenos Aires. Similarly, Mendoza in the west had closer ties with the Captaincy General of Chile, although the Andes mountain range was a natural barrier. Buenos Aires and Montevideo, who had a local rivalry, located in the La Plata Basin, had naval communications allowing them to be more in contact with European ideas and economic advances than the inland populations living in provinces such as Tierra del Fuego and Chaco. Paraguay was isolated from all other regions.

In the political structure most authoritative positions were filled by people designated by the Spanish monarchy, most of them Spanish people from Europe, also known as peninsulares, without a strong commitment for South American problems or interests. This created a growing rivalry between the Criollos, white people born in Latin America, and the peninsulares, Spanish people who arrived from Europe (the term &quot;Criollo&quot; is usually translated to English as &quot;Creole&quot;, despite being unrelated to most other Creole peoples). Although they were all considered Spanish, and there were no legal distinctions between Criollos and Peninsulares, most Criollos thought that Peninsulares had undue influence in political matters. The ideas of the American and French Revolutions, and the Age of Enlightenment, promoted desires of social change among the criollos. The full prohibition imposed by Spain to trade with other nations was also seen as damaging to the viceroyalty&#x27;s economy.

The population of Buenos Aires was highly militarized during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, part of the Anglo-Spanish War. Buenos Aires was captured in 1806, and then liberated by Santiago de Liniers with forces from Montevideo. Fearing a counter-attack, all the population of Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms was arranged in military bodies, including slaves. A new British attack in 1807 captured Montevideo, but was defeated in Buenos Aires, and forced to leave the viceroyalty. The viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte was successfully deposed by the criollos during the conflict, and the Regiment of Patricians became a highly influential force in local politics, even after the end of the British threat.

The transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil generated military concern. It was feared that the British would launch a third attack, this time allied with Portugal. However, no military conflict took place, as when the Peninsular War started Britain and Portugal became allies of Spain against France. When the Spanish king Ferdinand VII was captured, his sister Carlota Joaquina sought to rule in the Americas as regent, but nothing came out of it because of the lack of support from both the Spanish Americans and the British. Javier de Elío created a Junta in Montevideo and Martín de Álzaga sought to make a similar move by organizing a mutiny in Buenos Aires, but the local military forces intervened and thwarted it. Spain appointed a new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, and Liniers handed the government to him without resistance, despite the proposals of the military to reject him.

===The Revolution===

The military conflict in Spain worsened by 1810. The city of Seville had been invaded by French armies, which were already dominating most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Junta of Seville was disestablished, and several members fled to Cádiz, the last portion of Spain still resisting. They established a Council of Regency, prelude to the Cortes of Cadiz, with political tendencies closer to Liberalism and Popular sovereignty than the former Junta of Seville. This began the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, as soon as the news was known. Several citizens thought that Cisneros, appointed by the disestablished Junta, did not have the right to rule anymore, and requested the convening of an open cabildo to discuss the fate of the local government. The military gave their support to the request, forcing Cisneros to accept. The discussion ruled the removal of viceroy Cisneros and his replacement with a government junta, but the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power by appointing him president of such junta. Further demonstrations ensued, and the Junta was forced to resign immediately. It was replaced by a new one, the Primera Junta.

Buenos Aires requested the other cities in the viceroyalty to acknowledge the new Junta and send deputies. The precise purpose of these deputies, join the Junta or create a congress, was unclear at the time and generated political disputes later. The Junta was initially resisted by all the main locations around Buenos Aires: Córdoba, Montevideo, Paraguay and the Upper Peru. Santiago de Liniers came out of his retirement in Córdoba and organized an army to capture Buenos Aires, Montevideo had naval supremacy over the city, and Vicente Nieto organized the actions at the Upper Peru. Nieto proposed to José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, viceroy of the Viceroyalty of Peru at the North, to annex the Upper Peru to it. He thought that the revolution could be easily contained in Buenos Aires, before launching a definitive attack.

Buenos Aires was declared a rogue city by the Council of Regency, which appointed Montevideo as capital of the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, and Francisco Javier de Elío the new viceroy. However, the May Revolution was not initially separatist. Patriots supported the legitimacy of the Juntas in the Americas, while royalists supported instead the Council of Regency; both acted on behalf of Ferdinand VII. All of them believed that, according to the retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, in the absence of the rightful king sovereignty returned to the people, which would be capable to appoint their own leaders. They did not agree on who was that people, and which territorial extension had the sovereignty. Royalists thought that it applied to the people on European Spain, who had the right to rule over all the Spanish empire. The leaders of the May Revolution thought that it applied to all the capitals of Spanish kingdoms. José Gervasio Artigas would lead later a third perspective: the retroversion applied to all regions, which should remain united under a confederative system. The three groups battled one another, but the disputes about the national organization of Argentina (either centralist or confederal) continued in Argentine Civil War, for many years after the end of the war of independence.
==Armed conflict==
The Primera Junta sent military campaigns to the viceroyalty, in order to secure support to the new authorities and retain the authority held as the capital of the viceroyalty. The victories and defeats of the military conflict delimited the areas of influence of the new United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. With the non-aggression pact arranged with Paraguay early on, most of the initial conflict took place in the north, in Upper Peru, and in the east, in the Banda Oriental. In the second half of the decade, with the capture of Montevideo and the stalemate in Upper Peru, the conflict moved to the west, to Chile.
===Initial campaigns===
The first two military campaigns ordered by the revolutionary Junta in Buenos Aires were launched against Cordoba, where former Viceroy Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution, and the Intendency of Paraguay, which did not recognize the outcome of events at the May Revolution.

However, the improvised army gathered by Liniers at Cordoba deserted him before battle, so the former Viceroy attempted to flee to the Upper Peru, expecting to join the royalist army sent from the Viceroyalty of Peru to suffocate the revolution at Buenos Aires. Colonel Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, who led the patriot army, captured Liniers and the other leaders of the Cordoba counter-revolution on 6 August 1810, but, instead of executing them as he was instructed, he sent them back to Buenos Aires as prisoners. As a result, Ocampo was demoted and Juan José Castelli was appointed as the political head of the army. On 26 August, Castelli executed the Cordoba prisoners and led the Army of the North towards the Upper Peru:

*First Upper Peru campaign (1810–1811)
After securing the loyalty of the northwestern Provinces to the May Revolution through elections of representatives to the Junta in Buenos Aires, Castelli sent General Antonio González Balcarce into the Upper Peru, but he was defeated at the battle of Cotagaita. Castelli then sent him reinforcements, leading to the first patriotic victory at the battle of Suipacha, which gave Buenos Aires control over the Upper Peru. The royalist generals Vicente Nieto, Francisco de Paula Sanz and José de Córdoba y Rojas were captured and executed.

Castelli then proposed to the Buenos Aires Junta to cross the Desaguadero River, taking the offensive into the Viceroyalty of Peru domains, but his proposal was rejected. His army and Goyeneche&#x27;s stationed near the frontier, while negotiating. Goyeneche advanced and defeated Castelli at the Battle of Huaqui, whose forces dispersed and left the provinces. The resistance of patriot republiqueta guerrillas of Upper Peru, however, kept the royalists at bay, hampering any serious advance to the south:

*Paraguay campaign (1810–1811)
The other militia sent by Buenos Aires was commanded by Manuel Belgrano and made its way up the Paraná River towards the Intendency of Paraguay. A first battle was fought at Campichuelo, where the Patriots claimed victory. However, they were completely overwhelmed at the subsequent battles of Paraguarí and Tacuarí. Thus, this campaign ended in failure as well from a military point of view; however, some months later, inspired on the Argentine example, Paraguay broke its links with the Spanish crown by declaring itself an independent nation:

*First Banda Oriental campaign (1811)

===Renewed offensives===
The undesired outcomes of the Paraguay and Upper Peru campaigns led the Junta to be replaced by an executive Triumvirate in September 1811. This new government decided to promote a new campaign to the Upper Peru with a reorganized Army of the North and appointed José de San Martín, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars who had recently arrived from Spain, as lieutenant colonel. San Martín was ordered to create the professional and disciplined cavalry unit known as Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers ():

*Second Upper Peru campaign (1812–1813)
General Manuel Belgrano was appointed as the new commander of the Army of the North. Facing the overwhelming invasion of a royalist army led by General Pío de Tristán, Belgrano turned to scorched-earth tactics and ordered the evacuation of the people of Jujuy and Salta, and the burning of anything else left behind to prevent enemy forces from getting supplies or taking prisoners from those cities. This action is known as the Jujuy Exodus.

Turning against the Triumvirate orders, however, Belgrano decided to fight the royalists at Tucumán, obtaining a great victory and then decisively defeating the royalist army at the Battle of Salta, in northwestern Argentina, forcing the bulk of the royalist army to surrender their weapons. Tristán (a former fellow student with Belgrano at Salamanca University) and his men were granted amnesty and released. Then again, the patriot army was defeated into the Upper Peru at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma and retreated to Jujuy:

*Second Banda Oriental campaign (1812–1814)
In early 1812, the truce between Buenos Aires and Montevideo was over, and Manuel de Sarratea led an army to the Banda Oriental, but he was soon replaced by José Rondeau, who initiated a second siege of Montevideo. Although royalist Gaspar de Vigodet sought to break the siege, he was defeated at the Battle of Cerrito.

The Spanish navy then sought to evade the land blockade by raiding nearby populations on the west bank of the Uruguay river. On 31 January 1813, Spanish troops from Montevideo landed near the town of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe Province, but it was absolutely defeated by the &quot;Granaderos&quot; unit led by San Martín on February 3. The Battle of San Lorenzo ended further Spanish raids on the west bank of the Paraná river and the Triumvirate awarded San Martín the rank of general.

The Granaderos unit was instrumental in the Revolution of October 8, 1812 which deposed the government and installed a new Triumvirate, considered to be more committed to the cause of Independence. In fact, this second Triumvirate convened a national assembly which was meant to declare Independence. The Assembly, however, first decided replace the Triumvirate with a new unipersonal Executive office, the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, and elected Gervasio Antonio de Posadas for that role.

One of the first actions of Posadas was to create a naval fleet from scratch, which was to be financed by Juan Larrea, and appointed William Brown as lieutenant colonel and chief commander of it, on March 1, 1814. Against all the odds, on 14 May 1814 the improvised patriot navy engaged the Spanish fleet and defeated it three days later. This action secured the port of Buenos Aires and allowed the fall of Montevideo, which could not stand the siege any more, on 20 June 1814.

===The march towards Independence===
The fall of Montevideo eliminated the royalist menace from the Banda Oriental and meant the actual end of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. Soon afterwards, William Brown was awarded the rank of admiral, and Carlos María de Alvear, who was put in charge of the siege of Montevideo just a few days before the surrender of the city, succeeded his uncle Gervasio Posadas as the Supreme Director of the United Provinces, on January 11, 1815. Alvear, however, was resisted by the troops, so he was quickly replaced, on April 21, by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas through a mutiny. Álvarez Thomas then appointed Alvear as general of the Northern Army, in replacement of José Rondeau, but the officiality did not recognize this and remained loyal to Rondeau:

*Third Upper Peru campaign (1815)
:In 1815, the Northern Army, unofficially commanded by José Rondeau, started another offensive campaign in the Upper Peru, without the formal authorization of Supreme Director Álvarez Thomas. Lacking official support, however, the army was faced with anarchy. Moreover, soon after it would lose as well the aid of the Provincial Army of Salta, commanded by Martín Miguel de Güemes. After the defeats of Venta y Media (October 21) and Sipe-Sipe (November 28), the northern territories of the Upper Peru were effectively lost to the United Provinces. However, the Spanish Army could not advance further south as they were successfully stopped at Salta by the Güemes &quot;guerrillas&quot; from then on.

The unsuccessful outcome of the third Upper Peru campaign would spread rumors in Europe that the May Revolution was over. Furthermore, King Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne on 1813, so an urgent decision was needed regarding the political status of the United Provinces.

On July 9, 1816, an assembly of representatives of the Provinces (including three Upper Peru departments but excluding representatives from Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, Corrientes and the Banda Oriental, united into the Federal League) met at the Congress of Tucumán and declared the Independence of the United Provinces in South America from the Spanish Crown, with provisions for a national Constitution.

===Army of the Andes (1814–1818)===


In 1814, General José de San Martín had taken command of the Army of the North to prepare a new invasion of the Upper Peru. However, he quickly resigned as he foresaw yet another defeat. Instead, he developed a new strategy to attack the Viceroyalty of Perú through the Captaincy of Chile, inspired on the writings of Sir Thomas Maitland, who was quoted as saying that the only way to defeat the Spanish at Quito and Lima was attacking Chile first.

San Martín asked to become the Governor of the Province of Cuyo, where he prepared the Chile campaign. Installed in the city of Mendoza, San Martín reorganized the &quot;Granaderos&quot; cavalry unit into the Army of the Andes, which he created out of patriots from both the United Provinces and exiles from Chile.

In early 1817, San Martín led the crossing of the Andes into Chile, obtaining a decisive victory at the battle of Chacabuco on February 17, 1817, and took Santiago de Chile, where he refused the offer of the governorship of Chile in favour of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins (who became supreme director) because he did not wish to be diverted from his main objective, the capture of Lima. O&#x27;Higgins installed a new independent government. In December 1817, a popular referendum was set up to decide about the Independence of Chile.

However, Royalist resistance persisted in southern Chile, allied with the Mapuches. On April 4, Argentine Colonel Juan Gregorio de Las Heras had occupied Concepción, but the Royalists retreated to Talcahuano. In early 1818, Royalist reinforcements from the Viceroyalty of Peru arrived, commanded by general Mariano Osorio, and advanced towards the capital. San Martín then turned to scorched earth tactics and ordered the evacuation of Concepción, which he thought was impossible to defend. On 18 February 1818, the first anniversary of the battle of Chacabuco, Chile declared its independence from the Spanish Crown.

On March 18, 1818, Osorio led a surprise attack on the joint Argentine-Chilean army, which had to retreat to Santiago, with heavy losses. In fact, among the confusion, Supreme Director O&#x27;Higgins was thought to be killed, and panic seized the patriot camp. Crippled after his defeat at Cancha Rayada, O&#x27;Higgins delegated the command of the troops entirely to San Martín in a meeting on the plains of Maipú. Then, on April 5, 1818, San Martín inflicted a decisive defeat on Osorio in the Battle of Maipú, after which the depleted royalists retreated to Concepcion, never again to launch a major offensive against Santiago.

The Chile campaign is generally considered to be the conclusion of the Argentine War of Independence, as the further actions of the United Army into Peru were carried on under the authority of the Chilean government, not the United Provinces. However, defensive actions continued to be carried on in the northern frontier of the United Provinces until the 1825 Battle of Ayacucho, which ended the royalist threat from the Upper Peru.

==Annual commemoration==
The &quot;Día de la Revolución de Mayo&quot; (May Revolution Day) on May 25 is an annual holiday in Argentina to commemorate the First National Government (and the creation of the Primera Junta), one of the significant events in the history of Argentina. These and other events of the week leading to this day are referred to as the &quot;Semana de Mayo&quot; (May Week).

<doc id="554210" wikidata="Q17048660" url="?curid=554210" title="The Settlers (1993 video game)">
<text>The Settlers () is a 1993 city-building video game with real-time strategy elements for Amiga and MS-DOS. Developed and published by Blue Byte Software, the Amiga version was released in Germany in June 1993 and in the United Kingdom in November. The MS-DOS version was ported by Blue Byte and Massive Development. Blue Byte published this version in Europe under its original title in May 1994, but in North America, it was published in December by SSI as Serf City: Life is Feudal. In 2018, the game was re-released for Windows as &quot;The Settlers: History Edition&quot;. It is the first game in &quot;The Settlers&quot; series. 

The game is set in a medieval &quot;milieu&quot;, and controlled via a point and click interface, with the primary goal on each map being to build a settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of the entire map. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources. The game can be played in one of two modes; a series of thirty sequential missions against computer controlled opponents of increasing difficulty, or a free-game style mode, in which the player competes in individual games involving either computer-controlled opponents, human opponents, or a combination of both.

Originally envisioned as a standard god game, similar to &quot;Populous&quot;, the concept of &quot;The Settlers&quot; was altered by the game&#x27;s designer and programmer, Volker Wertich, after development had already begun. Wanting to create something unlike other titles available at the time, Wertich decided to focus on creating a game which could simulate a complex economic system, and which would feature gameplay built around a simulation of real-world supply and demand. However, due to the complexities of writing a codebase which understood and could realistically duplicate such a system, as well as ensuring the computer could handle military and economic matters simultaneously, the game required over two years of development. Wertich worked on the programming for a year, writing 70,000 lines of code, before any work began on the graphics.

The game received positive reviews and was first released on the Amiga and one year later ported to DOS due to its popularity on the Amiga. Critics especially praised the complexity of the economic system and the interrelatedness of the various buildings, as well as the graphics and sound effects. While some saw it as a god game, comparing it favourably to &quot;Populous&quot;, others saw it as a city-building game, comparing it favourably to &quot;SimCity&quot;. Others, however, felt it defined a new genre altogether by blending elements of god games and city-building games. It is often cited as one of the best Amiga games ever made. It was also a commercial success, selling over 400,000 units worldwide across both systems, considerably more than Blue Byte had anticipated. It went on to form the basis for &quot;The Settlers&quot; series, one of Blue Byte&#x27;s most successful franchises.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Settlers&quot; is a city-building game with real-time strategy elements, controlled via a point and click interface, in which the primary goal on each map is to build a settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of the entire map. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources.

===Game modes===
The game can be played in one of two modes. The first is a series of thirty sequential missions where the player, either alone or teaming with a second player, competes against computer controlled opponents of increasing difficulty. The second is a free-game style mode, played on either a randomly generated map, or a pre-built map, based on data input by the player prior to commencing. The player can then refine the game by selecting the number of races (from two to four), choosing which commander should lead each race (there are ten different commanders, ranging from peaceful and placid to warlike and aggressive), refining the amount of raw materials available to each player at the start of the game, setting the intelligence of the settlers and knights in each race&#x27;s service, and determining the rate at which each race&#x27;s settlers produce items. Games involving two human players are played in split screen, with the second player using a mouse on the same PC. Two-player mode allows two players to either team up together to compete against one or two computer opponents, or compete against one another and up to two additional computer opponents.

===Settlers and transportation ===
Whether playing a mission or a free game, each game begins the same way; the player is presented with part of the map, usually a green area on which it is easy to build, and must construct their castle/headquarters to begin their settlement. The basic gameplay revolves around serfs (the titular &quot;settlers&quot;) who transport materials, tools and produce, and who populate and perform the requisite task of each building. As the player constructs buildings and thus requires settlers to occupy them, the settlers automatically emerge from the castle as needed. As the settlement continues to grow in size, the castle&#x27;s quota of settlers will eventually be reached, and the player will need to build a warehouse to generate more settlers. At no point does the player directly control any individual settler - instead, general orders are issued (such as ordering the construction of a building), with the AI handling the delegation of orders to specific settlers.
An important game mechanic is the construction of a road network to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, and then manually build the road using a series of on-screen prompts advising as to the best direction in which to build. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag and set it down, at which point the next settler along will pick up the item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given road, cutting down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Waterways can also be constructed over small bodies of water in the same manner as roads, although the settlers need boats to cross.

===Economy===
The economy is under the player&#x27;s control throughout the game and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting how much of a given resource is transported to a given building, under five separate headings; food, wood, iron, coal and wheat. Similarly, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the significance of a particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a blacksmith, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, pliers will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith.

===Military===
The player&#x27;s territory can only be expanded by building a military complex near the territory border. Each complex must have at least one knight garrisoned for the territory to expand. Knights are automatically created from the pool of existing settlers in the headquarters, with each individual soldier requiring a sword and shield. Once knights are garrisoned, gold coins can be transported to the building to increase their morale, which allows them to fight more aggressively. They can also be promoted through five ranks, receiving training in the castle, or when stationed in a building, although they rank up slower when stationed.

The player also has control over the structure of their military, and is free to change the number of settlers who become knights, the rank of first-line defence knights, how many knights from each building can be used offensively, how many knights counter the enemy if nearby buildings are attacked, and how many knights take up positions in buildings not visible to the enemy, buildings visible but not immediately under threat, buildings under threat, and buildings about to be attacked. The player can also order lower-ranked knights to leave military buildings and return to the castle, replacing them with higher-ranked knights.

For the player to attack an enemy building, they must click on that building, and select the number of units they wish to use to carry out the attack. If the player&#x27;s units defeat all soldiers stationed in the building, they will occupy it, with the player&#x27;s territory increasing according to the building&#x27;s radius. Defense of the player&#x27;s military buildings is automatic; as enemies attack, any knights stationed in the building defend.

==Development==
Volker Wertich, the game&#x27;s designer and programmer, was initially inspired to create &quot;The Settlers&quot; by titles such as &quot;Little Computer People&quot;, &quot;Populous&quot; and &quot;SimCity&quot;. Originally, he intended the game to be similar to existing god games, with early development working to that end, but wanting to create something different, Wertich scrapped his initial concept and decided to focus on creating a game which could simulate a complex economic system, and which would feature gameplay built around a simulation of real-world supply and demand. To this end, the major innovation he introduced in &quot;The Settlers&quot; was how the game handled raw materials. In most other titles, raw materials were made available without the player having to do much in the way of producing them. In &quot;The Settlers&quot;, the player would be responsible for the raw materials upon which the economic system was built, by way of constructing and maintaining each link in the chain of production. For example, to create weapons, the player would need iron ore and coal, which could only be mined. However, for miners to be willing to work, they had to be fed, meaning the player would have to produce bread. This could only be done if the player had built a grain farm to grow crops, which would be converted into flour, and a well, which would produce water to be mixed with the flour to make bread. According to producer Thomas Hertzler, the main driving force behind much of the development was &quot;to create an economy simulation without it being boring&quot;.

Designing a game which could simulate such a system, proved far from simple, with the game requiring two years development and programming, with much of this time &quot;spent teaching the computer the basic facets of running an economic system&quot;. The game&#x27;s project manager Stefan Piasecki further explains the reason for the lengthy development cycle was &quot;due mainly to [the] enormous amount of data that had to be inputted. &quot;The Settlers&quot; isn&#x27;t like most games where the player has just one or two characters to guide through the game. &quot;The Settlers&quot;″ world is a unique place with all the elements of the real world&quot;. Wertich worked on the programming of the game for a year, writing 70,000 lines of 68000 assembly code, before any work began on the graphics.

His biggest challenge was getting the computer to understand and accurately simulate supply and demand, which, once the necessary buildings have been constructed, is handled almost entirely outside the privy of the player. Piasecki explains &quot;if there&#x27;s a windmill next to a farmer, the program has to check whether that miller has the capacity to grind his corn. If not, the corn must be taken to another mill. But what if the street is crowded? The computer then has to work out the best route for the farmer to take his goods&quot;. He further states:

The amount of possible on-screen action in the game depended on which model Amiga the player used, with the upper limit of settlers different on different machines. An Amiga 500 was capable of supporting up to roughly 8,000 settlers, whilst an Amiga 1200 could support up to roughly 16,000, and, with additional RAM, up to roughly 64,000. More precisely, because the game works on a 16-bit integer, the maximum number of settlers possible is 65,536. As any map capable of generating so many settlers must contain four races, the most settlers one player can ever control at any one time is 16,384. Additionally, the game features twenty-five different roles that a settler can occupy, with each role resulting in a settler who looks different and is animated differently from settlers in the other twenty-four roles. Each individual settler&#x27;s head is only 5x5 pixels, the space available for artist Christoph Werner to create twenty-five different looks. Furthermore, when the player zooms in, workers can be seen at work inside buildings, and sound effects change depending on where in the settlement the player is currently situated. All of this variety and variation added to the complexity when programming the game. The game&#x27;s numbers are also important in open-game mode, where the player can create the world by inputting a 16-digit code, with each digit ranging from 0 to 9, allowing for roughly 270 billion combinations, hence 270 billion slightly different maps.

The game also presented programming problems when being ported to DOS by Blue Byte and Massive Development. Thomas Häuser, who did quality assurance work on the game, and was promoted to project manager for &quot;The Settlers II&quot;, explains &quot;the Amiga source code was completely undocumented. To implement it, we used a team that had written a compiler for the assembly code. With that, the Amiga source was compiled to a PC assembly code and assembled afterwards. This was, of course, very complex and prone to errors&quot;. The only significant graphical difference between the Amiga version and the DOS version was that whilst the Amiga version was limited to 64 colors using the Amiga Halfbrite mode, the DOS version allowed 256 colors via 8-bit color VGA Mode.

==Reception==
&quot;The Settlers&quot; received positive reviews upon its release, especially on Amiga, where it was more widely reviewed than on DOS.

&quot;Amiga User International&quot; scored the game 97%, calling it &quot;a true masterpiece&quot; and &quot;an awesome piece of programming that could only have been achieved by creative talent of the highest order&quot;. They compared it favourably to &quot;Populous&quot;, and praised it as the best god game ever made, writing &quot;&quot;The Settlers&quot; has broken new programming ground and will be the benchmark in years to come for any up-and-coming software writer&quot;. They especially lauded the interrelatedness of the various buildings, and the complexity of the economic system. &quot;Amiga Format&quot;″s Rob Mead rated it 94%, giving it an &quot;&quot;Amiga Format&quot; Gold&quot; award, and calling it &quot;a major contender for the game of the year&quot;. He too praised the economic system and the connections between the buildings, saying &quot;the game oozes quality&quot;. He also cited the graphics and sound effects as especially noteworthy.

&quot;Amiga Computing&quot;″s Simon Clays scored it 93%, giving it a &quot;Gamer Gold&quot; award, and writing &quot;it contains some of the most intelligent interactions between player and characters yet to be seen on an Amiga&quot;. He too lauded the economic system, the connections between the buildings, the graphics and the sound effects, and he too found the game superior to &quot;Populous&quot;, writing &quot;with so many of this type of title knocking around, it really is refreshing to see a product that is fresh and entertaining&quot;. &quot;CU Amiga&quot;″s Tony Dillon scored it 90%, giving it an &quot;Amiga Screen Star&quot; award. He argued it was neither a god game nor a city-building game, but was instead a new type of game which combined ideas from other genres in a way never before seen. He particularly praised the variety of gameplay, arguing &quot;there are so many variations on the basic game, that you will wonder if you could ever play the same game twice&quot;. He also lauded the &quot;intelligent sounds, and graphics that actually mean something&quot;.

&quot;The One&quot;″s Simon Byron scored it 90%, writing &quot;it&#x27;s definitely a game you fall in love with instantly&quot;. His only criticism was the steep learning curve, arguing that on-screen labelling of the different buildings would have helped ease the player in. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;″s Cam Winstanley scored it 88%, comparing it favourably to &quot;Populous&quot;, &quot;A-Train&quot; and &quot;SimCity&quot;, and writing &quot;&quot;The Settlers&quot; is like lots of things, but still manages to be a unique game, which is truly a rare and satisfying thing to see these days&quot;. He praised the interface&#x27;s use of charts and graphs, and the attention to graphical detail. He concluded by calling it &quot;witty, imaginative and detailed, right down to the last leaf and fishing rod. It&#x27;s as complex or as simple as you want it to be and thoroughly absorbing&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Robert L. Hayes, Jr. scored the DOS version 4.5 out of 5, praising the complexity of the game&#x27;s economic system and the interconnectedness of the buildings, and calling it &quot;possibly the most realistic medieval economic model ever built into a computer system&quot;. He was also impressed with the interface, graphics, and animations. However, he called combat as dull and predictable, criticising the limited control players have. &quot;PC Player&quot;″s Jörg Langer scored it 83%, finding it slightly inferior to &quot;Populous II&quot;. Although he praised the economic system, the interrelatedness of the buildings, the graphics, and the interface, he was critical of both VGA and SVGA modes, arguing that VGA mode didn&#x27;t give a wide enough view, and in SVGA mode, the menus and icons were too small. He also criticised combat as &quot;impossible to influence&quot;.

&quot;PC Games&quot;″ Petra Maueröder scored it 82%. Although she praised the graphics and sound effects, she was critical of the game&#x27;s repetitiveness, writing &quot;after only a few days, the motivation drops significantly because the tasks become routine&quot;. She also criticised the pace of the game, arguing that for much of the playing time, the player is &quot;reduced to a passive observer&quot;. She ultimately found the game inferior to &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s T. Liam McDonald scored it 75%, arguing &quot;it&#x27;s fun and modestly challenging, but it could have been better&quot;. Criticisms included a lack of humour, a confusing interface, an inability to influence combat, and a lack of gameplay depth. He concluded that &quot;it stands as a lightweight, if entertaining game&quot;. &quot;Dragon&quot;″s Sandy Petersen scored it 3 out of 5, writing, &quot;it&#x27;s no &quot;SimCity&quot;, but it was inexpensive and easy to get into.&quot;

===Sales===
The game was a commercial success. By June 1996, it had sold over 215,000 units worldwide across both systems, well beyond Blue Byte&#x27;s expectations. By May 1998, it had sold over 400,000 units.

==Legacy==
The game has been cited as one of the best Amiga games ever made. In &quot;Amiga Joker&quot;″s 1994 Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards, it won both &quot;Best Game&quot; and &quot;Best Strategic Game&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; ranked it at #25 in their &quot;Amiga Top 100&quot;. In 2010, the Polish edition of &quot;CHIP&quot; ranked it at #1 in their &quot;Top Ten Amiga Games&quot;. In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked it at #16 in their &quot;30 best games for the Amiga&quot;.

The game formed the basis for &quot;The Settlers&quot; series, leading to nine further titles, and becoming one of Blue Byte&#x27;s best-selling franchises. Upon the success of the first game, Blue Byte began work immediately on a sequel, seeking out feedback from fans, and working to address anything they disliked or felt could be improved upon. Subsequent games in the series have been released on DOS, Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Nintendo DS, iOS, webOS, bada, Symbian, Android, and online.

Outside the official series, &quot;The Settlers&quot; has given rise to two free, open source games released under the GNU General Public License. &quot;Widelands&quot;, written in C++ and built on the SDL libraries, is an ongoing project begun in 2001. Inspired by and based upon &quot;The Settlers&quot; and, to a larger extent, &quot;The Settlers II&quot;, &quot;Widelands&quot; is itself a new game with its own storyline, races, buildings, graphics and gameplay. In a 2009 review of Build13 for &quot;Linux Journal&quot;, John Knight wrote: &quot;&quot;Widelands&quot; is a breath of fresh air in an extremely stale genre, whose roots ironically stem from way back in the past in RTS history. Whether you&#x27;re chasing a fix of that original &quot;Settlers&quot; feel or just want a different direction in RTS, this game is well worth a look&quot;.

&quot;Freeserf&quot;, developed by Jon Lund Steffensen and made available at GitHub, is an attempt to reimplement the &quot;Settlers&quot;″ game mechanics in C++. Begun in 2010, &quot;Freeserf&quot; still requires the original game files to work.

In August 2018, Ubisoft re-released the original game as &quot;The Settlers: History Edition&quot;, optimised for Windows 10, and featuring adjustable game speed, adjustable resolution, options for mouse, keyboard, and controller inputs, key mapping for keyboard and controller inputs, and different device support for split-screen, allowing any combination of mouse, keyboard, and controller inputs (i.e., one player can use a mouse and the other can use a controller). In November, the game was also included in &quot;The Settlers: History Collection&quot;, with the same features and Windows 10 optimisation as the stand-alone August release. Available only on Uplay, the &quot;History Collection&quot; also includes re-releases of &quot;The Settlers II&quot;, &quot;The Settlers III&quot;, &quot;The Settlers IV&quot;, &quot;The Settlers: Heritage of Kings&quot;, &quot;The Settlers: Rise of an Empire&quot;, and &quot;The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom&quot;.

<doc id="554211" wikidata="Q287942" url="?curid=554211" title="Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)">
<text>The Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 resulted from the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829; war broke out after the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II closed the Dardanelles to Russian ships and in November 1827 revoked the 1826 Akkerman Convention
in retaliation for the participation of the Imperial Russian Navy in the Battle of Navarino of October 1827.

After suffering several defeats, both in the Balkans and in the Caucasus, the Sultan decided to sue for peace, which resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Adrianople on 14 September 1829.

==The Balkan front ==
At the start of hostilities the Russian army of 100,000 men was commanded by Emperor Nicholas I, while the Ottoman forces were commanded by Agha Hussein Pasha appointed by Sultan Mahmut II. In April and May 1828 the Russian commander-in-chief, Prince Peter Wittgenstein, moved into the Danubian Principalities. In June 1828, the main Russian forces under the emperor crossed the Danube and advanced into Dobruja.

The Russians then laid prolonged sieges to three key Ottoman citadels in modern Bulgaria: Shumen, Varna, and Silistra. With the support of the Black Sea Fleet under Aleksey Greig, Varna was captured on 29 September. The Siege of Shumen proved much more problematic, as the 40,000-strong Ottoman garrison outnumbered the Russian forces. As the Russians were harassed by Turkish troops and ill-equipped, many of the soldiers died of disease or exhaustion. Russia then had to withdraw to Moldavia with heavy losses without having captured Shumen and Silistra.
As winter approached, the Russian army was forced to leave Shumen and retreat back to Bessarabia. In February 1829, the cautious Wittgenstein was replaced by the more energetic Hans Karl von Diebitsch, and the Tsar left the army for Saint Petersburg. On 7 May, 60,000 soldiers led by Field Marshal Diebitsch crossed the Danube and resumed the siege of Silistra. The Sultan sent a 40,000-strong contingent to the relief of Varna, which was defeated at the Battle of Kulevicha on 30 May. Three weeks later on 19 June, Silistra fell to the Russians.

On 2 July, Diebitsch launched the Trans-Balkan offensive, the first in Russian history since the 10th-century campaigns of Svyatoslav I. The contingent of 35,000 Russians moved across the mountains, circumventing the besieged Shumla on their way to Constantinople. The Russians captured Burgas ten days later, and the Turkish reinforcement was routed near Sliven on 31 July. By 22 August, the Russians had taken Adrianople, reportedly causing the Muslim population in the city to leave. Edirne Palace was heavily damaged by Russian troops.

==The Caucasus front==
Although the main fighting was in the west, there was significant action on the Caucasus front. Ivan Paskevich&#x27;s main aims were to tie down as many Turkish troops as possible; to capture the Turkish forts on the Black Sea coast that supported the Circassians and might be used to land troops; and to push the border west to some desirable point. Most of the Turkish partisans were led by the semi-independent Pasha of Akhaltsikhe and Muslim Georgian Beys who ruled the hills. Kars on an upland plain blocked the road from Akhaltsikhe to Erzurum, the main city in eastern Turkey. The Russo-Persian War (1826–28) had just ended, which removed a major danger. Since two-thirds of Paskevich&#x27;s troops were tied down holding the Caucasus and watching the Persians, he had only 15,000 men to fight the Turks. The Turks delayed attacking so Paskevich had time to move troops and supplies west, concentrating at Gyumri on the border.

1828, June: Kars: On 14 June, Paskevich set out for Kars 40 miles southwest which was held by 11,000 Turks with 151 guns. The capture of Kars was almost an accident. During a skirmish in the outskirts of the city a company of riflemen under Lieutenant Labintsev made an unauthorized advance. Seeing their danger, other companies rushed to the rescue. Their situation drew in more soldiers until most of the Russian force was massed at one point. The city wall was breached and soon the Turks held only the citadel. At 10:00 am on 23 June the citadel surrendered. The Turks lost 2,000 killed and wounded, 1,350 prisoners and 151 guns, although much of the garrison managed to escape. The Russians lost 400 killed and wounded. Kios Pasha of Erzurum was within an hour&#x27;s march of Kars, but when he heard the news he withdrew to Ardahan. 

1828, July: Akhalkalaki: Paskevich then feinted toward Erzurum but marched north to Akhalkalaki where he attacked the city first with his artillery. Under bombardment, the 1,000-man Turkish garrison became demoralized and half of the men tried to escape by letting themselves down the walls on ropes. Most of the Turks, however, were killed. The Russians then used the same ropes to scale the walls and enter the city. The Turks remaining in the garrison, some 300 men, surrendered on 24 July.

1828, August: Akhaltsikhe: Thirty miles to the northwest of Akhalkalaki was Akhaltsikhe with 10,000 men under a semi-independent Pasha. It guarded the Borjomi Gorge which led northeast to Georgia. Instead of taking the main road which went southwest to Ardahan and then north, Paskevich and 8,000 men marched three days through road less country and reached Akhaltsikhe on 3 August. The next day Kios Pasha and 30,000 men encamped four miles from the fort. Paskevich, outnumbered by an enemy on two sides, turned on Kios. After a day-long battle, Kios and his infantry force of 5,000 men fled to the Akhaltsikhe fortress while the remaining Turks scattered south to Ardahan. During the battle with Kios Pasha, the Russians lost 531 men, including a general, but confiscated a great amount of the Turk&#x27;s supplies. Paskevich and his troops now began a siege of Akhaltsikhe which had three layers of defense: the town with its crooked streets, ravines and bastions; the fortress; and a citadel.

When the attack began at 4:00 pm, the citizens defended themselves as best they could but by nightfall the town was on fire. In one mosque 400 people burned to death. By dawn of the 16th the ruined town was in Russian hands. The Russians then moved their artillery up to bear on the fortress walls. On 17 August, Kios Pasha surrendered the fortress and the citadel on the condition that he and his remaining 4,000 men be allowed to withdraw with their arms and property. During the battle, the Russians lost about 600 men while the Turks lost 6,000.

The next day, Paskevich attacked and captured Atskhur castle which guarded the Borjomi Gorge leading from Akhaltsikhe northeast to Georgia. On 22 August the Russians occupied Ardahan, the road junction connecting Akhaltsikhe-Akhalkalaki to the Kars-Erzurum road. Seeing no further opportunities the Russians retired to winter quarters.

1829: Kios Pasha was replaced by Salih Pasha with Haghki (Hakki) Pasha as his deputy. Over the winter Paskevich went to St Petersburg with a plan for a massive invasion of Anatolia, but his plan was rejected. Twenty thousand (20,000) raw recruits were to be sent to the Caucasus, but they would not be ready until late summer. On 30 January the Russian ambassadors to Tehran, including Alexander Griboyedov were killed by a mob. Both sides were hesitant to restart the fighting but the possibility tied up part of the Russian army. On 21 February Akhmet Beg (Ahmet Bey) of Hulo and 15,000 Lazes and Adjars occupied the town of Akhaltsikhe and besieged the fortress. Twelve days later Russian Commander Burtsov forced the Borjomi Gorge and the Adjars fled with their loot. General Hesse drove back a Turkish advance from Batum and captured the Turkish camp of Limani south of Poti. Far to the southeast, Bayazid was besieged by the Pasha of Van. The main Turkish advance began in mid-May. Kiaghi Bek approached Ardahan, but was driven north to Adjaria where he threatened Akhaltsikhe. He was defeated at Digur south of Akhaltsikhe and the Russians went south to join Paskevich at Kars.

1829, June: Saganlug and Erzurum: On 13 June Paskevich (12,340 infantry, 5,785 cavalry and 70 guns) left Kars for Erzurum. The Turks had 50,000 men including 30,000 nizams (new-model infantry). They stood between Hasankale and Zivin on the Erzurum-Kars road. Further east on the road an advanced force (20,000 under Haghki Pasha) held the Millidiuz (Meliduz) Pass over the Saganlug mountain. Paskevich chose to take the inferior road to the north, place himself near Zevin between the two armies and attack Haghki Pasha from the rear. There were complex maneuvers and small actions. At 7:00 pm on the 19th Paskevich attacked and completely defeated the western army. Next day he turned east and captured Haghki Pasha and 19 guns, but most of his men managed to scatter. With the armies out of the way he set out for Erzurum. On 27 June, the city, which had not seen Christian soldiers within its walls for five centuries, surrendered.

1829: After Erzurum: From Erzurum the main road led northwest through Bayburt and Hart to Trebizond on the coast, a very formidable place that could only be taken with the fleet which was now busy on the Bulgarian coast. In July Russian Commander Burtsov went up this road and was killed at Hart. To retrieve Russia&#x27;s reputation Paskevich destroyed Hart on 28 July. He sent an army west and brought it back, went up the Trebizond road, saw that nothing could be accomplished in that direction, and returned to Erzurum. Hesse and Osten-Sacken pushed north toward Batum and returned. The Pasha of Trebizond moved against Bayburt and was defeated on 28 September, the last action of the war. The Treaty of Adrianople (1829) was signed on 2 September 1829, but it took a month for the news to reach Paskevich. In October his army began marching home. Russia kept the ports of Anapa and Poti, the border forts of Atskhur, Akhalkalaki and Akhaltsikhe, but returned Ardahan and the Pashaliks of Kars, Bayazid and most of Akhaltsikhe Pashalik. In 1855 and 1877 Paskevich&#x27;s work had to be done all over again. One consequence of the war was the migration of 90,000 Armenians from Turkish to Russian territory.

==Treaty of Adrianople==

Faced with these several defeats, the Sultan decided to sue for peace. The Treaty of Adrianople signed on 14 September 1829 gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. Turkey recognized Russian sovereignty over parts of present-day northwest Armenia. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia (guaranteeing their prosperity and full &quot;liberty of trade&quot;) until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. Moldavia and Wallachia remained Russian protectorates until the Crimean War. The Straits Question was settled four years later, when both powers signed the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi.

Regarding the Greek situation with the treaty of Adrianople, the Ottoman Sultan finally recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Greece. Much later, Karl Marx in an article in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; (21 April 1853), wrote: &quot;Who solved finally the Greek case? It was neither the rebellion of Ali Pasha, neither the battle in Navarino, neither the French Army in Peloponnese, neither the conferences and protocols of London; but it was Diebitsch, who invaded through the Balkans to Evros&quot;.

<text>Nidda () is a town in the district Wetterau, in Hesse, Germany. It is situated on the Nidda river, approximately northeast of Frankfurt am Main.

== Division of the town ==
The municipality consists of the districts Unter-Widdersheim, Ober-Widdersheim, Borsdorf, Harb, Bad-Salzhausen, Geiß-Nidda, Ulfa, Stornfels, Eichelsdorf, Ober-Schmitten, Unter-Schmitten, Kohden, Nidda, Michelnau, Fauerbach, Wallernhausen, Schwickartshausen, Unter-Lais and Ober-Lais.

== History ==
Invited through a manifesto issued by Catherine the Great, several families from this region travelled to Russia in the late 18th century to settle in the Volga Region near Saratov. Family names Appel, Daubert, Pfaffenroth, Weitz and Scheuermann are examples of Volga Germans who helped to establish local villages, including Yagodnaya Polyana.

Nidda has a vibrant mix of people from many backgrounds, including Turkish, Russian and Pakistani. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat opened its first purpose-built mosque in Nidda in 2011.

<text>Setebos is one of the outermost retrograde irregular satellites of Uranus. It was discovered on 18 July 1999 by John J. Kavelaars &quot;et al.&quot; and provisionally designated S/1999 U 1.

Confirmed as Uranus XIX, it is named after the god Setebos worshipped by Caliban and Sycorax in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Sycorax and Prospero, suggesting common origin. However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The satellite appears neutral (grey) in visible light (colour indices similar to Prospero but different from Sycorax (which is light red).

A crater on Umbriel is also named after Setebos, but with the spelling Setibos.

<text>The American Standard Version (ASV), officially Revised Version, Standard American Edition, is a Bible translation into English that was completed in 1901 with the publication of the revision of the Old Testament. The revised New Testament had been published in 1900.

It was previously known by its full name, but soon came to have other names, such as the American Revised Version, the American Standard Revision, the American Standard Revised Bible, and the American Standard Edition.

==History==
The American Standard Version, which was also known as The American Revision of 1901, is rooted in the work begun in 1870 to revise the King James Bible of 1611. This project eventually produced the Revised Version (RV) in the UK. An invitation was extended to American religious leaders for scholars to work on the RV project. In 1871, thirty scholars were chosen by Philip Schaff. The denominations represented on the American committee were the Baptist, Congregationalist, Dutch Reformed, Friends, Methodist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Protestant Episcopal, and Unitarian. These scholars began work in 1872. Three of the editors, the youngest in years, became the editors of the American Standard Revised New Testament: Drs. Timothy Dwight V, Joseph Henry Thayer and Matthew B. Riddle.

The Revised Version New Testament was published in 1881, the Old Testament in 1885, and the Apocrypha in 1894, after which the British team disbanded. Unauthorized copies of the RV then appeared in the US, having the American team suggestions in the main text. This was possible because while the RV in the UK held a Crown copyright as a product of the University Presses of Oxford and Cambridge, this protection did not extend to the US where the text was not separately copyrighted. In 1898, Oxford and Cambridge Universities published their editions of the RV with some American suggestions included. However, these suggestions were reduced in number from those in the appendixes. Some of the Americanized editions by Oxford and Cambridge Universities had the title of &quot;American Revised Version&quot; on the cover of their spines. Some of Thomas Nelson&#x27;s editions of the American Standard Version Holy Bible included the Apocrypha of the Revised Version. The Revised Version of 1885 and the American Standard Version of 1901 are among the Bible versions authorized to be used in services of the Episcopal Church and the Church of England. The American Standard Version entered the public domain on January 1, 1957 upon expiration of its copyright.

==Features==
The divine name of the Almighty (the Tetragrammaton) is consistently rendered &quot;Jehovah&quot; in 6,823 places of the ASV Old Testament, rather than &quot;&quot; as it appears mostly in the King James Bible and Revised Version of 1881–85. There are seven verses in the King James Bible where the divine name appears: Genesis 22:14, Exodus 6:3, Exodus 17:15, Judges 6:24, Psalm 83:18, Isaiah 12:2 and Isaiah 26:4 plus its abbreviated form, Jah, in Psalms 68:4. The English Revised Version (1881–1885, published with the Apocrypha in 1894) renders the Tetragrammaton as Jehovah where it appears in the King James Version, and another eight times in Exodus 6:2,6–8, Psalm 68:20, Isaiah 49:14, Jeremiah 16:21 and Habakkuk 3:19 plus as its abbreviated form, Jah, twice in Psalm 68:4 and Psalm 89:8. The reason for this change, as the Committee explained in the preface, was that &quot;the American Revisers [...] were brought to the unanimous conviction that a Jewish superstition, which regarded the Divine Name as too sacred to be uttered, ought no longer to dominate in the English or any other version of the Old Testament&quot; 
==Revisions==
The ASV has been the basis of various revisions and new translations: 
* Revised Standard Version (1952)
* Amplified Bible (1965)
* New American Standard Bible (1971)
* The Living Bible (1971) 
* Recovery Version (1999)
* World English Bible (2000)
* American Literary Version (also known as &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;) (2016)
* Refreshed American Standard Version (2021)
* Updated American Standard Version (2022)

<text>Piran (; ) is a town in southwestern Slovenia on the Gulf of Piran on the Adriatic Sea. It is one of the three major towns of Slovenian Istria. The town is known for its medieval architecture, with narrow streets and compact houses. Piran is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Piran and one of Slovenia&#x27;s major tourist attractions.

==History==

In the pre-Roman era, the hills in the Piran area were inhabited by Illyrian Histri tribes who were farmers, hunters and fishermen. They were also pirates who disrupted Roman trade in the northern Adriatic.

The Piran peninsula was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 178 and 177 BC and settled in the following years with rural homes (&quot;villae rusticae&quot;). 
The decline of the Roman Empire, from the 5th century AD onward, and incursions by the Avars and Slavs at the end of the 6th century, prompted the Roman population to withdraw into easily defensible locations such as islands or peninsulas. This started local urbanisation and by the 7th century, under Byzantine rule, Piran had become heavily fortified. Despite the defences, the Franks conquered Istria in 788 and Slavs settled in the region. By 952, Piran had become a part of the Holy Roman Empire.

The earliest reliable records of the area are in the 7th century work Cosmographia by an anonymous cleric of Ravenna. The name of the town most probably originates from the Greek &quot;pyrrhos&quot;, which means &#x27;red&#x27;, because of the reddish flysch stones commonly found in the town&#x27;s area.
Some historians also refer it to &quot;pyros&quot;, meaning &#x27;fire&#x27;, due to ancient lighthouses which were supposed to be on the edge of the marina.

From 1283 to 1797, the town became part of the Republic of Venice, where it was governed in a semi-autonomous way, with a council of local noblemen assisting the Venetian delegate. Several enemy (e.g. from the Republic of Genoa) and pirate assaults were repelled during the late Middle Ages; a great pestilence hit the town in 1558, killing about two thirds of the population. The last decades of Venetian rule were marked by decadence, due to the competition with the nearby Austrian port town of Trieste.The town was annexed to the Austrian Empire in 1797; but during the years from 1806 to 1814, it was ceded to the Napoleonic Empire. On 22 February 1812, the Battle of Pirano was fought between a British and a French ship of the line in the vicinity of Piran. This was a minor battle of the Adriatic campaign of the Napoleonic Wars. 

At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Piran was an Austro-Hungarian town with over 15,000 inhabitants, roughly the same size as nearby Koper. Around 80% of the population was ethnically and culturally Italian, with a Slovene minority of around 15%. It was a flourishing market and spa town with good transport connections. The first trolleybus line in the Balkans was introduced to public service on 24 October 1909 in Piran. In 1912, it was replaced by a tramway that operated on the same route till 1953.

After the First World War, together with Trieste and all Istria, the town was ceded to Italy. There were no particular events in those years, until Italy entered the Second World War in 1940. With the defeat of the Axis powers and the rise of Tito&#x27;s rule, Piran was assigned to the Free Territory of Trieste, Zone B, under Yugoslavian administration, changing the official name in &quot;Piran&quot;. The town was annexed to Yugoslavia in 1954, according to the London Memorandum signed together with Italy. A significant part of Piran&#x27;s population chose to emigrate to Italy or abroad in the final phase of the Istrian–Dalmatian exodus, rather than stay in socialist Yugoslavia. The annexation to Yugoslavia was finally ratified with the Osimo Treaty in 1975, with the municipality becoming part of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Until the mid-20th century, Italian was the dominant language, but it was replaced by Slovene following the Istrian exodus. Since 1991, Piran has been part of independent Slovenia. 

On 24 October 2010, Slovenia became the first country of former communist Europe to elect a black mayor. The physician Peter Bossman, who came from Ghana in the late 1970s, was elected the Mayor of Piran. He officially took office at the first constitutional meeting of the Municipal Council on 12 November 2010, succeeding Tomaž Gantar. He represents the Social Democrats.

The territorial claims of Croatia and Slovenia in the Gulf of Piran remain an important matter of debate in the Croatia–Slovenia border disputes that began after the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

==Culture and education==

Piran is the birthplace of the Italian composer and violinist Giuseppe Tartini, who played an important role in shaping its cultural heritage. The town&#x27;s main square, Tartini Square (, ), is named after him. In 1892, the 200th anniversary of his birth, a monument to Tartini was erected in Piran. Venetian artist Antonio Dal Zotto was commissioned to create a larger-than-life bronze statue, which was mounted on its pedestal in 1896. The statue dominates the square, overlooked by the Cathedral of Saint George. The painter Cesare Dell&#x27;Acqua was also born in Piran.

Piran is the seat of the Euro-Mediterranean University of Slovenia (EMUNI), founded in 2008 as one of the cultural projects of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. The Piran Coastal Galleries, a public institution encompassing a group of six public contemporary art galleries, is based in Piran.

===Cultural events===
Musical evenings have taken place for decades in the Greyfriars Franciscan monastery&#x27;s atrium, one of the most beautiful cloister atriums in the Slovenian Littoral, which has good acoustics.

The municipality&#x27;s festival is 15 October, which celebrates the foundation of the first Slovenian partisan naval detachment, named Koper, in 1944. 

==Geography and climate==
Piran is located at the tip of the Piran peninsula, part of the Gulf of Trieste. 

To the east of the town, along the northern coastline (in the direction to Strunjan) there is a small tourist settlement named Fiesa. Piran and Fiesa are connected by a promenade along the beach. Piran has a humid subtropical climate with warm summers and cool rainy winters. Snow is rare (usually 3 days per year, almost always in traces). There are 22 days a year with maximum temperatures of or higher; on one day a year the temperature does not exceed . Fog appears about 4 days per year, mainly in winter.

==Demographics==

According to the Austrian language census of 1910, there were 7,379 inhabitants in the town proper, 95.97% Italians and 0.09% Slovenes. In 1945, the town proper had 5,035 inhabitants, 91.32% Italian and 8.54% Slovene speakers. After World War II, when Piran became a part of Yugoslavia, there was an exodus of the Italian-speakers from the region. They were replaced by Slovene settlers, both from other areas of Slovenian Istria and from interior areas of the country. In 1956 there were 3.574 inhabitants, 67.6% Slovene and 15.5% Italian. 
==Monuments==

Piran was heavily influenced by the Venetian Republic and Austria-Hungary, therefore the monuments differ greatly from those in inner parts of Slovenia. The Piran town walls were constructed to protect the town from Ottoman incursions; many parts of the town walls from different eras remain, and are of interest to tourists. In the middle of the town is the Tartini Square, with a monument in memory of Giuseppe Tartini. Nearby are located various important buildings, such as Tartini’s house, first mentioned in 1384 and one of the oldest in town, the Municipal Palace, Loggia and Benečanka, among others. On the hill above the town is the biggest and most important church, the Saint George&#x27;s Church, with a Franciscan monastery nearby.

==Communications and transport==
There is an international airport and a marina in the vicinity of the town. The medium-wave transmitter of Radio Koper is in Piran. It transmits on 1170 kHz and has a 123.6-metre-tall guyed mast with cage antenna. The town is connected with Koper, Izola, Portorož (the location of the airport), Sečovlje and Lucija by a cheap bus line. The lines of other coastal settlements operate mostly during the tourist season.

The first trolleybus line in Slovenia entered public service on 24 October 1909 in Piran, then part of Austria-Hungary. It ran from Tartini Square along the coast and the shipyard to Portorož and Lucija. The town authorities bought five trolleybuses manufactured by Austrian company Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. In 1912, it was replaced by a tram system that operated until 1953, when it was superseded by buses.

==Sports==
Pod Obzidjem Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Piran. It is used for football matches and is the home ground of football team NK Portorož Piran. The stadium currently holds 750 spectators, 500 of them can be seated.

<doc id="554232" wikidata="Q685683" url="?curid=554232" title="First Schleswig War">
<text>The First Schleswig War (), also known as the Schleswig-Holstein uprising () and the Three Years&#x27; War (), was a military conflict in southern Denmark and northern Germany rooted in the Schleswig–Holstein question: who should control the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg, which at the time were ruled by the king of Denmark in a personal union. Ultimately, the Danish side proved victorious with the diplomatic support of the great powers, especially Britain and Russia, since the duchies were close to an important Baltic seaway connecting both powers.

While a plurality of the population in Schleswig was Danish, and vast majority in Northern Schleswig, the Germans made up the vast majority in Holstein and Lauenburg.

In March 1848, the German population of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg rebelled, and created a provisional government and army. As Holstein and Lauenburg were member states, the German Confederation supported the rebels as a federal war &quot;(Bundeskrieg)&quot; according to its statutes. This was continued by the German Central Government (of the federal state that replaced the Confederation in 1848/49-51), with most of the German troops being provided by Prussia.

The war was interrupted in August 1848 by the armistice of Malmö, but started again with a Danish offensive in February 1849. In summer 1850, Prussia had to back down and leave the rebels to their fate. On 1 April 1851, the Schleswig-Holstein army was disbanded. The London Protocol of 1852 was the final settlement of the conflict with the great powers confirming the Danish king to be the duke of the duchies but also declaring that the duchies had to remain independent from Denmark proper.

==Background==
At the beginning of 1848, Denmark included the Duchy of Schleswig, and the king of Denmark ruled the duchies of Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg within the German Confederation. The majority of the ethnic Germans in Denmark lived in these areas. Germans made up a third of the country&#x27;s population, and the three duchies accounted for half of Denmark&#x27;s economy. The Napoleonic Wars, which had ended in 1815, had fanned both Danish and German nationalism. Pan-German ideology had become highly influential in the decades prior to the wars, and writers such as Jacob Grimm (1785–1863) and the Norwegian Peter Andreas Munch (1810–1863) argued that the entire peninsula of Jutland had been populated by Germans before the arrival of the Danes and that therefore Germans could justifiably reclaim it. Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae (1821–1885), an archaeologist who had excavated parts of the Danevirke, countered the pro-German claims, writing pamphlets which argued that there was no way of knowing the language of the earliest inhabitants of Danish territory, that Germans had more solid historical claims to large parts of France and England, and that Slavs by the same reasoning could annex parts of eastern Germany.

The conflicting aims of Danish and German nationalists contributed to the outbreak of the First Schleswig War. Danish nationalists believed that Schleswig, but not Holstein, should be a part of Denmark, as Schleswig contained a large number of Danes, whilst Holstein did not. German nationalists believed that Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg should remain united, and their belief that Schleswig and Holstein should not be separated led to the two duchies being referred to as Schleswig-Holstein. Schleswig became a particular source of contention, as it contained a large number of Danes, Germans, and North Frisians. Another cause of the war was the legally questionable change to the rules of ducal succession in the duchies.

King Christian VIII of Denmark died in January 1848. His only legitimate son, the future Frederick VII, seemed unable to beget heirs. Thus the duchies appeared likely to pass to the rule of the House of Oldenburg, which might have resulted in a division of Denmark. Accordingly, Christian VIII had decreed (8 July 1846) a change to the succession law in the duchies to allow succession through the female line. The implementation of this law was illegal.

The question of Schleswig-Holstein was also a major concern of the other European powers. In order to maintain access to the Baltic, the British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston preferred that control of the Danish straits linking the North Sea to the Baltic Sea not be controlled by any major European power such as Prussia. From Palmerston&#x27;s viewpoint, having a relatively weak power such as Denmark maintain control of the Danish straits was far preferable to having a strong power, and as such Britain tended to support the Danish claims, believing that a Danish-Prussian war might lead to Prussia annexing not just the two duchies, but also all of Denmark. Likewise, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia supported Denmark as he did not want a strong power controlling the Danish straits. Nicholas also believed that if Denmark were defeated even without being annexed, it might lead to the Danes joining a Scandinavian Union that would pose a potential threat to the ability of the Baltic fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy to leave the Baltic. France, the European power most opposed to German unification, was due to the revolution of 1848 unable to take a strong stand on German affairs. The Austrian empire, Prussia&#x27;s rival for the ascendency in German affairs, was paralyzed as revolts had broken out against the House of Habsburg in Prague, Milan, Buda, Krakow, and in Vienna itself. 

In Berlin, the foreign policy decision-making was described as &quot;chaotic&quot; with the weak and indecisive King Fredrich Wilhelm IV receiving conflicting advice from rival groups of advisers about what to do. However, in the aftermath of the revolution of 1848, which had damaged the prestige of the House of Hohenzollern as fighting had broken out in the streets of Berlin, it was felt essential to take a bold foreign policy step which would restore the prestige of the Prussian state. The king and his advisors were not German nationalists, but the German liberals opposed to the absolutist Prussian monarchy were. The king&#x27;s advisors believed that a German nationalist war would win support for the Prussian state from many of those liberals who were opposed to it.

In addition, the chaos of the revolution of 1848 was felt to offer a unique opportunity to create a greater Prussia by seizing territory, all the more as France was unable to act. However, the king and his advisers were not prepared to risk a general European war over the Schleswig-Holstein question. Joseph von Radowitz, the king&#x27;s most trusted adviser, wrote in his diary: &quot;The present political-military crisis cannot drag on, it must come to a rapid conclusion&quot;. Radowitz was prepared to support a war provided it would be brought to a victorious conclusion swiftly, which would allow Prussia to present the other European powers with a fait accompli. Knowing of the intense Russian opposition to Prussia controlling the Danish straits, Radowitz advised the king to limit the war to the two duchies and not allow Prussian troops to enter Jutland, which he predicted would lead to &quot;unforeseeable consequences&quot; as it was likely that Russia would intervene. The Prussian Foreign Minister Heinrich Alexander von Arnim supported war, believing that Prussia could occupy the two duchies within eight days, leaving Britain and Russia no time to react.

Both Russia and Britain were opposed to Denmark losing control of the Danish straits, but were otherwise supportive of Prussia. Palmerston supported a stronger Prussia and even a Germany unified under Prussian leadership as a way of weakening France. King Fredrich Wilhelm&#x27;s sister was married to the Emperor Nicholas I, and the Prussian king believed that his brother-in-law could be persuaded to accept Prussia seizing control of the two duchies. Furthermore, Nicolas was well known to be an intense admirer of Prussian militarism and saw Prussia as the stronger ally in the so-called informal &quot;eastern bloc&quot; that consisted of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The emperor saw Prussia as the more reliable partner in opposing Polish nationalism than the Austrian empire, hence his preference for Prussia over Austria in the &quot;eastern bloc&quot;. Nicholas had long made it known that he viewed a Prussian-dominated Germany as a welcome development, which he saw as a way of weakening France, the nation that he hated and feared the most. Fredrich Wilhelm did not want to risk a confrontation with either Britain or Russia, and was only persuaded to act when convinced a war would not cause such a confrontation.

==Trigger==
Schleswig-Holsteinian Prince Frederik of Noer took the 5th &quot;Lauenburger&quot; Rifle Corps (Jägerkorps) and some students of Kiel university to take over the fortress of Rendsburg in Schleswig-Holstein. The fortress contained the main armoury of the duchies, the 14th, 15th, and 16th Infantry Battalions, the 2nd Regiment of Artillery, as well as some military engineers. When Noer&#x27;s force arrived, they found that the gates to the fortress had been left open for an unknown reason and promptly walked in, surprising the would-be defenders. After delivering a speech to the defenders, the prince secured the allegiance of the battalions and regiment of artillery to the provisional government. Danish officers who had been serving in the defence of the fortress were allowed to leave for Denmark on the assurance that they did not fight against Schleswig-Holstein in the coming war.

==Course of the war==

===1848===

Wishing to defeat Denmark before German troops arrived to support them, 7,000 Schleswig-Holstein volunteers under General Krohn occupied Flensborg on 31 March. Over 7,000 Danish soldiers landed east of the city, and Krohn, fearing he would be surrounded, ordered his forces to withdraw. The Danes were able to reach the Schleswig-Holsteiners before they were able to retreat, and the subsequent Battle of Bov on 9 April was a Danish victory. At the battle, the Prince of Noer, senior commander of the Schleswig-Holstein forces, did not arrive until two hours after fighting had started, and the Schleswig-Holsteiners were more prepared for the withdrawal they had intended to make than for an engagement.

A timeline of events is shown thus:
* 12 April: The German Confederate Diet recognized the provisional government of Schleswig and commissioned Prussia to enforce its decrees. General Wrangel was also ordered to occupy the city of Schleswig.
* 19 April: Prussian troops cross the Dannevirke into Schleswig
* 23 April: Prussian victory in battle at Schleswig
* 23 April: German victory in battle at Mysunde
* 24 April: Hanoverian victory in battle at Oversø
* 2 May: Capture of Fredericia by Prussian forces
* 27 May: Battle at Sundeved
* 28 May: Battle of Nybøl
* 5 June: Danish victory over Germans in battle at Dybbøl Hill
* 7 June: Battle at Hoptrup
* 30 June: Battle at Bjerning

The Germans embarked on this course of participation in the First Schleswig War alone, without assistance from other European powers, who were united in opposing any dismemberment of Denmark, with even the Austrians refusing to assist the Germans. Sweden landed 7,000 troops on the island of Fyn opposite Jutland to assist the Danes, and Nicholas I of Russia, speaking with authority as head of the senior Gottorp line, pointed out to Frederick William IV of Prussia the risks of a collision. The British government threatened to send the Royal Navy to assist in preserving the status quo, though this threat did not ultimately materialise.

It was Russian diplomatic intervention that decided the outcome of the war in April 1848. The Russian ambassador in Berlin, Baron Peter von Meyendorff, delivered a note to King Fredrich Wilhelm stating that Russia regarded the advance of the Prussian troops towards Jutland as an extremely unfriendly act as the note stated: &quot;The invasion, intended for Jutland, seriously injuries the interests of all the powers bordering on the Baltic, and stretches to the breaking point the political equilibrium throughout the north which was established in the treaties&quot;. To reinforce the point, the empress of Russia wrote to her brother, King Fredrich Wilhelm, saying: &quot;It is your troops who have grabbed the weak Denmark with their superior force. The war can be expanded widely if you pursue it. Stop! There is still time! Think about the difficulties Germany has to battle in order to bring about inner security, the dangers which threaten in the West. Do not force upon the Tsar the necessity to come to the assistance with strong measures of another state whose downfall Russia cannot regard with indifference and will not tolerate. It cannot come to pass that Denmark is absorbed into Germany; of this you can be certain.&quot; Nicholas ordered Russia to mobilise, sent a squadron of the Russian Baltic fleet to Danish waters as a show of support, and politely told his brother-in-law he was willing to risk war over the issue. The Russian threats had the desired impact on Frederich Wilhelm who now claimed to have been misled by von Arnim into intervening in the war.

The fact that Prussia had entered the war on behalf of the revolutionary forces in Schleswig-Holstein created a great number of ironies. The newly elected Frankfurt Diet tended to support the incursion into the Schleswig-Holstein War while King Frederick William did not. Indeed, Frederick William ordered Friedrich von Wrangel, commanding the German army, to withdraw his troops from the duchies; but the general refused, asserting that he followed order from the new German Central Government and not of the King of Prussia. Wrangel proposed that, at the very least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the German National Assembly.

Furthermore, on 7 August 1848, Archduke John, as head of the Provisional Central Power, published three additional demands upon the Danes:

# That persons to be elected for the formation of a new common government for the duchies of Holstein and Schleswig, before the conclusion of the armistice, are expressly and specifically agreed among the contracting parties in such a way that the existence and the prosperous effectiveness of the new government are guaranteed;
# That in the duchies, existing laws and ordinances mentioned in Article VII. all are expressly permitted up to the conclusion of the armistice;
# That troops remaining in the duchies of Holstein and Schleswig under Article VIII shall all be under the orders of the German commander-in-chief (Wrangel).

The Danes rejected this proposal outright and negotiations were broken off.

Prussia was now confronted on the one side by German nationalists urging it to action, on the other side by the European powers threatening dire consequences should it persist. After painful hesitation, Frederick William chose what seemed the lesser of two evils, and, on 26 August, Prussia signed a convention at Malmö which yielded to practically all the Danish demands. The Holstein estates appealed to the German National Assembly, which hotly took up their cause, but it was soon clear that the German Central Government had no means of enforcing its views. In the end the convention was ratified at Frankfurt. The convention was essentially nothing more than a truce establishing a temporary &quot;modus vivendi&quot;. The main issues, left unsettled, continued to be hotly debated.

In October, at a conference in London, Denmark suggested an arrangement on the basis of a separation of Schleswig from Holstein, despite their historical affiliation dating back to 1460, with Schleswig having a separate constitution under the Danish crown.

===1849===
* 27 January: The London conference result was supported by Great Britain and Russia and accepted by Prussia and the German parliament in Frankfurt. The negotiations broke down, however, on the refusal of Denmark to yield the principle of the indissoluble union with the Danish crown.
* 23 February: The truce came to an end.
* 3 April: The war was renewed. At this point Nicholas I intervened in favour of peace. However, Prussia, conscious of her restored strength and weary of the intractable temper of the Frankfurt parliament, determined to take matters into her own hands.
* 3 April: Danish victory over Schleswig-Holstein forces in battle at Adsbøl.
* 5 April: Battle of Eckernförde
* 6 April: Battles at Ullerup and Avnbøl.
* 13 April: Danish victory over Saxon forces in battle at Dybbøl.
* 23 April: Battle at Kolding.
* 31 May: Danes stop Prussian advance through Jutland in cavalry battle at Vejlby.
* 4 June: inconclusive Battle of Heligoland (1849)
* 6 July: Danish victory in sortie from Fredericia.
* 10 July: Another truce was signed. Schleswig, until the peace, was to be administered separately, under a mixed commission; Holstein was to be governed by a vicegerent of the German Empire (an arrangement equally offensive to German and Danish sentiment). A settlement seemed as far off as ever. The Danes still clamoured for the principle of succession in the female line and union with Denmark, the Germans for that of succession in the male line and union with Holstein.

===1850===
In April 1850, Prussia, which had pulled out of the war after the treaty of Malmö, proposed a definitive peace on the basis of the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; and postponement of all questions as to mutual rights. To Palmerston the basis seemed meaningless and the proposed settlement would settle nothing. Nicholas I, openly disgusted with Frederick William&#x27;s submission to the Frankfurt Parliament, again intervened. To him Duke Christian of Augustenborg was a rebel. Russia had guaranteed Schleswig to the Danish crown by the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo. As for Holstein, if the King of Denmark could not deal with the rebels there, he himself would intervene as he had done in Hungary. The threat was reinforced by the menace of the European situation. Austria and Prussia were on the verge of war (see Autumn Crisis 1850), and the sole hope of preventing Russia from entering such a war on the side of Austria lay in settling the Schleswig-Holstein question in a manner desirable to it. The only alternative, an alliance with the hated Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s nephew, Louis Napoleon, who was already dreaming of acquiring the Rhine frontier for France in return for his aid in establishing German sea-power by the ceding of the duchies, was abhorrent to Frederick William.
* 8 April: Karl Wilhelm von Willisen became the Supreme Commander of the German Forces.
* 2 July: A treaty of peace between Prussia and Denmark was signed at Berlin. Both parties reserved all their antecedent rights. Denmark was satisfied that the treaty empowered the King of Denmark to restore his authority in Holstein with or without the consent of the German Confederation. Danish troops now marched in to coerce the refractory duchies. While the fighting went on, negotiations among the powers continued.
* 24–25 July: Danish victory in the Battle of Idstedt.
* 28 July: Danish victory in cavalry battle at Jagel.
* 2 August: Great Britain, France, Russia and Sweden-Norway signed a protocol, to which Austria subsequently adhered, approving the principle of restoring the integrity of the Danish monarchy.
* 12 September: Battle at Missunde.
* 4 October: Danish forces resist German siege at Friedrichstadt.
* 24 November: Battle of Lottorf
* 31 December: Skirmish at Möhlhorst.

===1851===
* May: The Copenhagen government made an abortive attempt to come to an understanding with the inhabitants of the duchies by convening an assembly of notables at Flensburg.
* 6 December 1851: The Copenhagen government announced a project for the future organization of the monarchy on the basis of the equality of its constituent states, with a common ministry.

===1852===
* 28 January: A royal letter announced the institution of a unitary state which, while maintaining the fundamental constitution of Denmark, would increase the parliamentary powers of the estates of the two duchies. This proclamation was approved by Prussia and Austria, and by the German confederal diet insofar as it affected Holstein and Lauenburg. The question of the Augustenborg succession made an agreement between the powers impossible.
* 31 March: The Duke of Augustenborg resigned his claim in return for a money payment. Further adjustments followed.
* 8 May: another London Protocol was signed. The international treaty that became known as the &quot;London Protocol&quot; was the revision of the earlier protocol, which had been ratified on 2 August 1850, by the major German powers, Austria and Prussia. The second, actual London Protocol was recognized by the five major European powers (the Austrian Empire, the Second French Republic, the Kingdom of Prussia, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), as well as the two major Baltic Sea powers of Denmark and Sweden.

The Protocol affirmed the integrity of the Danish federation as a &quot;European necessity and standing principle&quot;. Accordingly, the duchies of Schleswig (a Danish fief), and Holstein and Lauenburg (sovereign states within the German Confederation) were joined by personal union with the King of Denmark. For this purpose, the line of succession to the duchies was modified, because Frederick VII of Denmark remained childless and hence a change in dynasty was in order. (The originally conflicting protocols of succession between the duchies and Denmark would have stipulated that, contrary to the treaty, the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg would have had heads of state other than the King of Denmark.) Further, it was affirmed that the duchies were to remain as independent entities, and that Schleswig would have no greater constitutional affinity to Denmark than Holstein.

This settlement did not resolve the issue, as the German Diet had steadfastly refused to recognize the treaty, and asserted that the law of 1650 was still in force, by which the Duchies were not united to the state of Denmark, but only to the direct line of the Danish kings, and were to revert on its extinction, not to the branch of Glucksburg, but to the German ducal family of Augustenburg. Only twelve years passed before the Second Schleswig War in 1864 resulted in the king of Denmark transferring the disputed duchies to Austria and Prussia.

<text>The Second Schleswig War (; or German Danish War), also sometimes known as the Dano-Prussian War or Prusso-Danish War, was the second military conflict over the Schleswig–Holstein question of the nineteenth century. The war began on 1 February 1864, when Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border into the Danish fief Schleswig. Denmark fought troops of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire representing the German Confederation.

Like the First Schleswig War (1848–1852), it was fought for control of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg. Succession disputes concerning the duchies arose when the Danish king died without an heir acceptable to the German Confederation. The war started after the passing of the November Constitution of 1863, which tied the Duchy of Schleswig more closely to the Danish kingdom, which was viewed by the German side as a violation of the London Protocol.

The war ended on 30 October 1864, with the Treaty of Vienna and Denmark&#x27;s cession of the Duchies of Schleswig (except for the island of Ærø, which remained Danish), Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg to Prussia and Austria.

==Background==

In 1848, Denmark received its first liberal constitution. At the same time, and partly as a consequence, the secessionist movement of the large German majority in Holstein and southern Schleswig was suppressed in the First Schleswig War (1848–51), when the Germans in both territories failed in their attempt to become a united, sovereign and independent state: at the time, King Frederik VII of Denmark was also duke of the duchies of Holstein and Schleswig. However, the movement continued throughout the 1850s and 1860s as Denmark attempted to integrate the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom, while liberal proponents of German unification expressed the wish to include the Danish-ruled duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in a Greater Germany. Holstein was completely ethnically German, had been a German fief before 1806 and was a part of the German Confederation from 1815. Schleswig was a Danish fief and was linguistically mixed between German and Danish and North Frisian.

Before the Middle Ages, the people of Schleswig spoke Danish and Frisian, and as late as the 18th century many rural areas of southern Schleswig still spoke Danish. In the early 19th century, the northern and middle parts of Schleswig spoke Danish, but the language in the southern half had shifted to German. German culture was dominant among the clergy and nobility; Danish had a lower social status and was spoken mainly by the rural population. For centuries, while the rule of the king was absolute, these conditions had created few tensions. When liberal and egalitarian ideas spread and nationalist currents emerged about 1820, identification was mixed between Danish and German: the German elites in Schleswig wished to be a part of Germany, while the Danes wanted Schleswig to be more firmly integrated into Denmark proper. Furthermore, there was a grievance about tolls charged by Denmark on ships passing through the Danish straits between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. To avoid that expense, Prussia and Austria planned to construct the Kiel Canal, which could not be built as long as Denmark ruled Holstein.
Much of the dispute focused on the heir of King Frederik VII of Denmark. The Germans of Holstein and Schleswig supported the House of Augustenburg, a cadet branch of the Danish royal family, but the average Dane considered them too German and preferred the rival Glücksburg branch with Prince Christian of Glücksburg as the new sovereign. Prince Christian had served on the Danish side in the First Schleswig War (1848–1851). Both Britain and the Russian Empire wanted the Danish straits, linking the North Sea to the Baltic Sea, to be controlled by a relatively weak power such as Denmark in order to allow their respective navies to either enter the Baltic, in the case of Britain, or exit the Baltic, in the case of Russia. During the First Schleswig war in 1848–49, Russia had threatened twice to enter the war on the side of Denmark, which proved to be the deciding factor in the outcome of the war.
The peace treaty that had ended the war in 1851 stipulated that the duchy of Schleswig should be treated the same as the duchy of Holstein regarding its relations with the Kingdom of Denmark. However, during the revisions of the 1848 constitution in the late 1850s and early 1860s, Holstein refused to acknowledge the revision, creating a crisis in which the parliament in Copenhagen ratified the revision but Holstein did not. In 1863, Frederik VII died, and the new Danish monarch, King Christian IX, ordered that the new constitution should apply to Schleswig and Denmark, but not to Holstein. This was a clear breach of the 1851 peace treaty and the London Protocol of 1852 and gave Prussia and the German Confederation a &quot;casus belli&quot; against Denmark. The German position was considerably more favorable than it had been thirteen years before, when Prussia had to give in due to the risk of military intervention by Britain, France and Russia on behalf of Denmark: France had colonial problems, not least with Britain. Otto von Bismarck had succeeded in obtaining cooperation from the Austrian Empire, which underlined its great power status within the German union, while Britain was upset that Denmark had violated the London Protocol.

To understand the Danish resolve in this question one must understand that the Danes regarded Schleswig as an ancient core region of Denmark. The southern part of Schleswig contains the ruins of the old Danish Viking &quot;capital&quot; Hedeby and the Danevirke fortification; its first sections were built around 400–500 AD, possibly to protect Denmark from migrating tribes during the age of migration. Before the Danes took possession of the area, around 500 AD, Schleswig was the home of the Angles, of which many migrated to Britain, where they later formed the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; the remaining Angles are believed to have assimilated with the Danes, indeed the Angles and the Danes seem to have had a very close relationship as attested by the shared sagas of the early English and Danes. Thus, to suggest that the region did no longer fully belong to Denmark was seen as a great provocation to the Danes&#x27; ancestral claim to Schleswig.

The Germans, on the other hand, referred to medieval history: Already in 1326 and 1448, the Danish kings had accepted the almost complete independence of Schleswig from the Danish Crown. The Germans argued that the duchy had therefore not been part of Denmark proper for 400 years, but instead was &quot;forever inseparable&quot; (&quot;up ewich ungedeelt&quot;) from the German duchy of Holstein, something the Danish king had promised as early as 1460.

In short, the Danes considered Schleswig to be an integral part of Denmark and wished to make this clear by enacting a new constitution that excluded Holstein, while the Germans thought that Schleswig was inseparable from Holstein: If the Danish crown wished to treat the two Duchies differently, the only solution was, in their eyes, to get rid of Danish rule altogether. Both sides thus saw the other as the aggressor.

==The international situation==
The Prussian minister-president, Otto von Bismarck, had been appointed to that position in 1862 with orders from the king to resolve a crisis caused by the unwillingness of the liberal lower house of the Landtag of Prussia to vote for increased taxes to pay for increased military spending. The refusal of the &quot;Landtag&quot; to vote for the taxes that the war minister, General von Roon, had insisted were absolutely necessary to pay for a program of military modernization had caused a profound political crisis. In effect, the liberal-dominated &quot;Landtag&quot; were making a bold bid to be co-equals along with the king in governing Prussia by asserting their &quot;power of the purse&quot; over the military. The kings of the House of Hohenzollern always jealously guarded their prerogatives to have sole control of the military, and King Wilhelm I was completely against making any concessions to the &quot;Landtag&quot; in exchange for the &quot;Landtag&quot; voting for the taxes to pay for military modernization. The diplomat Bismarck had been appointed minister-president largely because the king believed that he was a man capable of having the &quot;Landtag&quot; vote for the Army Law taxes without making any concessions over the king&#x27;s control of the military. Bismarck had a reputation of a someone who was a gruff bully who liked to push other people around, but also a man of considerable charm and grace when he wanted to be. Finally, Bismarck was perceived as a man who was very clever in resolving apparently intractable problems while being very committed to upholding the existing system, and it was for this reason the king had appointed him minister-president, believing that he was the best man to resolve the crisis. Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;blood and iron&quot; speech in which he stated that the problems of Germany would be solved by &quot;blood and iron&quot; instead of talks was an effort to win over the support of the liberals for his policy of increased taxes to pay for higher military spending. The &quot;Landtag&quot; refused to vote for the requested taxes. Bismarck solved the crisis simply by ordering the Prussian state to collect the taxes without the consent of the &quot;Landtag&quot; by claiming there was &quot;a hole in the constitution&quot; by saying if the &quot;Landtag&quot; and the king were deadlocked then the state had the right to collect taxes without the permission of the &quot;Landtag&quot;, a claim that he privately admitted to being nonsensical. Bismarck&#x27;s actions in having collecting taxes without the permission of the &quot;Landtag&quot; was manifestly illegal and unconstitutional, and made him unpopular. The liberals in Prussia also tended to be German nationalists who supported including the two duchies of Schleswig-Holstein into a projected unified German state, and Bismarck saw launching a war in the name of German nationalism as a way to bring around the liberals into supporting the Prussian state, all the more so as a war would demonstrate the value of a stronger Prussian Army and thus justify the illegal taxes.

In the First Schleswig War, the possibility of Russian intervention on the side of Denmark had proved decisive in deciding the outcome of the war. The Crimean War had changed the entire posture of Russian foreign policy. Before the Crimean War, Russia had been the most reactionary of the European states and the one most committed to more or less upholding the status quo established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. After the Crimean War, Russia was now a revisionist power out to challenge the European status quo, and any developments likely to change the European power structure were now welcome in St. Petersburg. Furthermore, the Crimean War and its aftermath made it extremely unlikely that Russia would work together with Britain or France, which established a room for maneuver for Prussia that did not exist in 1848–1850. Tsar Alexander II saw the possibility of a stronger Prussia as a way of weakening France. During the Polish Uprising of 1863–1864, Napoleon III had taken a strongly pro-Polish line, which increased the already considerable mistrust and dislike of France in St. Petersburg (Kissinger lists this as a prime example of &quot;strategic frivolity&quot;). Alexander tended to favor a pro-Prussian line provided that Bismarck gave assurances that Prussia would not annex Denmark proper, and limit its ambitions to the two duchies.

Britain was the power most committed to supporting Denmark, but while Britain had the world&#x27;s most powerful navy, the relatively small size of the all-volunteer British Army led London to need a continental ally to provide the necessary military force on land. The Crimean War had so poisoned Anglo-Russian relations that it proved impossible for London and St. Petersburg to work together during the crisis. Additionally, in the American Civil War, the United States Navy blockaded the South, causing the so-called &quot;cotton famine&quot; that gravely damaged the British economy. Though Britain had found an alternative source of cotton in the form of Egypt, the &quot;cotton famine&quot; and the efforts of blockade runners to smuggle cotton out of the Confederate States of America to Britain had led to acute Anglo-American tensions with many Americans perceiving Britain to be supporting the Confederacy. The continual mistrust between Washington and London posed constraints on British foreign policy and limited London&#x27;s options during the Second Schleswig War with much of the British Army being stationed in what is now Canada to guard against a possible American invasion. Finally, after the Indian Mutiny of 1857–58, the British army in India was vastly increased. The fact that much of the British army was garrisoning India and Canada led to a shortage of British troops being free for operations in Europe.

In July 1863, British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, had given a speech saying: &quot;I am satisfied with all reasonable men in Europe, including those in France and Russia, in desiring that the independence, the integrity and rights of Denmark may be maintained. We are convinced-I am convinced at least-that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow those rights and interfere with that independence, those who made the attempt, would in the result, that it would not be Denmark alone with they would have to contend with. Palmerston&#x27;s speech led to exaggerated hopes in Denmark of British intervention should the Schleswig-Holstein question come to war. However, the small size of the British Army limited the United Kingdom&#x27;s ability to intervene in Schleswig-Holstein together with the continual tensions with the United States required that Britain act in conjunction with another major European power such as Russia or France. Palmerston&#x27;s speech was, in short, a bluff.

Napoleon III, the emperor of the French, was widely considered to be a reckless and dangerous adventurer, a man who was widely mistrusted by all the other powers. In 1861, Napoleon had France invade Mexico to install the Archduke Maximillian as the puppet emperor of Mexico. Britain was opposed to the French project in Mexico, causing much Anglo-French tension, making it unlikely that France and Britain would work together with regard to the Schleswig-Holstein question. On 15 November 1863, Napoleon had given a speech in Paris stating: &quot;The compacts of 1815 have ceased to be in force&quot;. Accordingly, Napoleon invited 20 European leaders to a congress in Paris to discuss revisions in the European power structure. Although the projected congress of Paris never occurred, Napoleon&#x27;s gambit in openly rejecting the decisions of the Congress of Vienna led him to be perceived as a leader out to restore the French-dominated Europe of his namesake, and made it extremely unlikely that the other European powers would co-operate with France. Napoleon took a pro-Prussian line with regard to the Schleswig-Holstein question, seeing Prussian ambitions as helpful to his own plans. Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys, the French ambassador in Berlin, told Bismarck in 1863 that France would support Prussia annexing the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein provided that France received compensation by being allowed to annex parts of the Rhineland. Palmerston&#x27;s rejection of having Britain attending the projected Congress of Paris was taken as a slight by Napoleon III, who notably refused British appeals during the war to co-operate against Prussia.

==Constitutional crisis (1848–1863)==
After years of growing tension, the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark in 1848 had complicated matters further, as many Danes wished for the new liberal constitution to apply to all Danes, including those in Schleswig. The constitutions of Holstein and Schleswig were dominated by the Estates system, giving more power to the most affluent members of society, with the result that both Schleswig and Holstein were politically dominated by a predominantly German class of landowners. Thus two systems of government co-existed within the same state: a constitutional monarchy in Denmark, and absolutism in Schleswig and Holstein. The three units were governed by one cabinet, comprising liberal Danish ministers, who urged economic and social reforms, and conservative ministers, who opposed political reform. This caused a deadlock for practical lawmaking. Moreover, Danish opponents of this so-called Unitary State (&quot;Helstaten&quot;) feared that Holstein&#x27;s presence in the government and simultaneous membership of the German Confederation would lead to increased German interference with Schleswig, and even in purely Danish affairs.

At the same time, liberal German politicians came to power in Schleswig and Holstein; their goal was to unify the two duchies, to gain independence from the Danish king and to join the German Confederation as a sovereign state. The objectives of the Danish and German liberals were therefore incompatible, which in 1848 ultimately led to war. In Germany, many people viewed the conflict of Schleswig as a war of liberation, while most Danes considered it German aggression.

In Copenhagen, the Palace and most of the administration (unlike most liberal politicians) supported a strict adherence to the status quo. The same applied to foreign powers, such as Great Britain, France and Russia, who would not accept a weakened Denmark in favour of Germany, nor a Prussia that had acquired Holstein with the important naval harbour of Kiel that controlled the entrance to the Baltic. After Prussia had therefore been forced to withdraw its support from the insurgents in Schleswig and Holstein in 1851, the Danes were able to defeat the rebels in the First Schleswig War. However, in 1852, they had to commit themselves to treat Schleswig constitutionally no different from Holstein. This contradicted the objective of the Danish liberals to fully reintegrate Schleswig into Denmark. In 1858, the German Confederation deposed the &quot;union constitution&quot; of the Danish monarchy concerning Holstein and Lauenburg, which were members of the Confederation. The two duchies were henceforth without any constitution, while the union constitution still applied to Schleswig and Denmark proper.

As the heirless King Frederik VII grew older, Denmark&#x27;s successive National-Liberal cabinets became increasingly focused on maintaining control of Schleswig following the King&#x27;s demise. The King died in 1863 at a particularly critical time; work on the November Constitution for the joint affairs of Denmark and Schleswig had just been completed, with the draft awaiting his signature. The new monarch, King Christian IX, felt compelled to sign the draft constitution on 18 November 1863, expressing grave concern. In doing so, the new king violated the London Protocol of 1852 and gave the Prussian minister-president, Otto von Bismarck, a justification for war.

This action caused outrage among the duchies&#x27; German population and a resolution was passed by the German Confederation at the initiative of Bismarck, calling for the occupation of Holstein by Confederate forces. The Danish government abandoned Holstein and pulled the Danish Army back to the border between Schleswig and Holstein. Most of it fortified itself behind the Danevirke. This order to retreat without combat caused adverse comments among some Danish private soldiers, but the military circumstances made it wise to shorten the frontier that needed to be defended. Also, as the administrations of Holstein and Lauenburg were members of the German Confederation, not pulling back might have caused a severe political crisis and perhaps war with Great Britain, a guarantor of the London Protocol.

==The Danish strategy==
There were so-called &quot;flank positions&quot; near Ebeltoft (North), the fortified city of Fredericia (center), and Dybbøl in the south designed to support the strategy of defending the peninsula of Jutland along the north–south axis using naval supremacy to move the army north–south and hence trap an invading army in futile marches between these flank positions. This would deny the (assumed superior) invader the chance of forcing the defenders into a decisive battle, and give the defenders the opportunity to swiftly mass and counter-attack weak enemy positions, besieging forces, or divided forces by shifting weight by sea transport. The political dimension of this strategy was to draw out the war and hence give time and opportunity for the &quot;great powers&quot; to intervene diplomatically—it was assumed that such an intervention would be to the advantage of Denmark. This strategy had been successful in the First Schleswig War.

However, unrealistic expectations of the potency of the Danish army and incompetence at the political level had overruled the army command&#x27;s wishes to defend Jutland according to the above plan, and instead favoured a frontal defense of Jutland on or near the historical defense (and legendary border) line at the Danevirke, near the city of Schleswig in the south. Hence resources had been put into the Danevirke line and not into the flank positions, which stayed akin to battlefield fortifications rather than modern fortifications capable of withstanding a modern bombardment.

The problem with the Danevirke line was that perhaps it was relatively strong against a frontal assault but leaned on bodies of water or marshes at both ends. In early 1864, these waters and marshes froze solid in a hard winter letting the Germans bypass the Danevirke. The first attempt to bypass the position failed near Missunde, but eventually the Germans appeared in force in the Danevirke&#x27;s rear, compelling the Danish high command to order the line abandoned. As this decision was taken in violation of direct orders from the Danish government and in opposition to public opinion in Denmark, General de Meza was relieved of his command and replaced by the more loyal General Gerlach.

The Danish army then occupied another fortified line called &quot;the old Dybbøl&quot;. This position did not bar the entrance to Jutland but only the tip of a peninsula jutting into the Baltic Sea. There is little doubt that the command of the army did not believe that they could successfully repulse a well-prepared German siege and consequent assault on the Dybbøl position, and assumed that the political level would let the army be evacuated by sea and then fight the war on the principles of the north–south axis strategy.

But the political level did not appreciate the gravity of the situation, insisting on maintaining military presence in Schleswig and at the same time refused more modest German demands of peace. Hence the army was ordered to defend the Dybbøl position &quot;to the last man&quot;, and consequently the siege of Dybbøl began.

==Communications in the area==
The only railways in 1864 in Denmark north of the Kongeå were a line in Sjælland from Copenhagen to Korsør, and one in northern Jutland from Århus to the northwest. Any reinforcements for the Danevirke from Copenhagen would have gone by rail to Korsør and thence by ship to Flensburg, taking two or three days, if not hindered by storm or sea-ice. There was a good railway system in the duchies, but not further north than Flensburg and Husum.

Schleswig city, Flensburg, Sønderborg, and Dybbøl were all connected by a road paved with crushed rock, this being the route the army took. The same road continued from Flensburg to Fredericia and Århus and this was the route later taken by the Prussian army when it invaded Jutland.

==Change in Danish law==
On 18 November 1863, King Christian IX of Denmark signed the so-called &quot;November constitution&quot; establishing a shared law of succession and a common parliament for both Schleswig and Denmark. This was seen by the German Confederation as a violation of the 1852 London Protocol. On 28 November, the German Diet removed the Danish delegate for the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg pending resolution of the succession issue and the naming of a new delegate from a government recognized by the Diet. On 24 December 1863, Saxon and Hanoverian troops marched into Holstein on behalf of the Confederation (as part as the federal execution, &quot;Bundesexekution&quot;, against Holstein). Supported by the German soldiers and by loyal Holsteiners, Frederick VIII, a claimant to both duchies, took control of the government of Holstein.

==Events==

===1864===

====January====

In January the situation remained tense but there was no fighting; Danish forces controlled the north bank of the Eider River and German forces the south bank. All the inland waters (Eider River, Treene, Schlei, and the marshes east of Husum and around the Rheider Au) that the Danes were relying on as defence to guard the flanks of the Dannevirke, were frozen hard and could be crossed easily.

Domestically, Bismarck had been under great pressure since a constitutional crisis in 1862, and he was hoping to gain public support among Prussian liberals by achieving the &quot;liberation&quot; of Schleswig. The decision to not settle for the occupation of the German Duchy of Holstein, but to invade Schleswig, was taken by the Prussian and Austrian governments alone. The other members of the German Confederation did not agree, and it was even discussed to declare war on the two great powers. However, due to the military superiority of the Prussians and Austrians, this did not happen.

On 14 January 1864, Austria and Prussia declared that they would take action against Denmark without regard to decisions of the German Confederation. On 16 January 1864, Bismarck issued an ultimatum to Denmark demanding that the November Constitution should be abolished within 48 hours. This was politically impossible, particularly given the short deadline, and the demand was consequently rejected by the Danish government.

====February====

At the start of the war, the Danish army consisted of about 38,000 men in four divisions. The 8th Brigade consisted of the 9th and 20th regiments (approximately 1,600 soldiers each), mainly soldiers from the middle and west and north of Jutland. About 36,000 men defended the Dannevirke, a job which it was said would have needed 50,000 men to do properly. The 1st Regiment had been changed from a battalion to a regiment on 1 December 1863. 

The Prussian army had 37 battalions, 29 squadrons and 110 guns, approximately 38,400 men. The Austrian army had 20 battalions, 10 squadrons and 48 guns, approximately 23,000 men. During the war the Prussian army was strengthened with 64 guns and 20,000 men. The supreme commander for the Prussian-Austrian army was Field Marshal Friedrich Graf von Wrangel. The Austrian troops were led by General Ludwig von Gablenz.

Prussian and Austrian troops crossed into Schleswig on 1 February 1864 against the resistance of the Federal Assembly of the German Confederation, and war became inevitable. The Austrians attacked towards the refortified Dannevirke frontally while the Prussian forces struck the Danish fortifications at Mysunde (on the Schlei coast of Schwansen east of Schleswig town), trying to bypass the Danevirke by crossing the frozen Schlei inlet, but in six hours could not take the Danish positions, and retreated.
In the Battle for Königshügel (Danish &quot;Kongshøj&quot;, translated &#x27;King&#x27;s Hill&#x27;) near Selk on 3 February 1864, Austrian forces commanded by General Gondrecourt pushed the Danes back to the Dannevirke. The Danish 6th Brigade had an important part. The battle was fought in a snowstorm at .
Danish fighting against Austrians at Selk and Kongshøj and Saksarmen on 3 February 1864 is described as follows:
A Danish military report dated 11 February 1864 describes incidents near Königshügel/Kongshøj and Vedelspang as follows:
On 5 February 1864, the Danish commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Christian Julius De Meza, abandoned the Dannevirke that night to avoid being surrounded and withdrew his army to Flensburg. The retreat caused the deaths and capture of 600 men. Ten soldiers froze to death and were counted as a part of the casualties that night. The hasty retreat also forced the Danes to abandon their important heavy artillery.

The railway from the south to Flensburg was never properly used during this evacuation and the Danish army only evacuated what men and horses could carry or pull by road, leaving behind much artillery, most importantly heavy artillery. Some hours later, the Prussians and Austrians discovered the retreat and started to pursue.

This withdrawal to Als and Dybbøl has gone down in Danish history as one of the worst experiences that Danish soldiers have been exposed to. Some of them compared it to Napoleon&#x27;s retreat from Moscow. It was northwards in a north gale with driven snow, and most of the soldiers had had no rest for the last four days and nights. The march was burdened with artillery guns and supply carts and had to be as slow as its slowest component. Men and horses had trouble standing. Horses could not carry or pull their loads properly because of the snow and ice; riders had to dismount and lead their horses. Artillery guns and carts overturned. The column of men and horses and vehicles seemed endless. The army had to march from the Danevirke to Flensburg, which took about 14–18 hours. (Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein is at the east end of the Danevirke and is 20 mi from Flensburg as the crow flies. The march was actually longer than 20 mi because soldiers had to walk from their positions to Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein first.) They also had to fight rearguard against pursuing Prussians and Austrians. Some men in sight of Flensburg and thankful for the coming rest were ordered to stop or go back to man checkpoints. Many men were missing at the roll call, and the army thought that many Schleswigian soldiers had deserted during the march and went home. However, most of them came in that morning or the next morning.
Near Stolk-Helligbek, about 10 kilometers north of Schleswig, pursuing Austrians reached them, and in heavy fighting near Oversø, the 9th and 20th regiments of the 8th Brigade lost 600 men dead, injured and captured. On that day ten Danish soldiers died of hypothermia.

The Prussians crossed the frozen Schlei at Arnis on 6 February 1864, defeating the Danes there.

In the Battle of Sankelmark (about eight kilometers south of Flensburg) pursuing Austrians caught up with the Danish rear party, which consisted of the 1st and 11th regiments. The Danes were commanded by Colonel Max Müller. A hard fight, where large parts of 1st Regiment were taken prisoner, stopped the Austrians, and the retreat could continue. However, the Danes lost more than 500 men there. After a short rest and some food and drink in Flensburg, the 8th Brigade had to march to Sønderborg, where they were taken by ship to Fredericia. Soldiers packed the ship and could not lie down to rest. Furthermore, some had to stay outside on the deck and were nearly frozen. Other units stayed in Dybbøl; some reportedly were so exhausted on arrival that they laid on the ground in heaps three or four deep to sleep.

The loss of the Dannevirke without a fight, which in the 19th century played a big role in Danish national mythology due to its long history, caused a substantial psychological shock in Denmark and, as a result, de Meza had to resign from supreme command. Denmark never again ruled the Dannevirke. The Austrians, under general Ludwig Karl Wilhelm von Gablenz, marched north from Flensburg, while the Prussians advanced east on Sønderborg.

On 18 February 1864, some Prussian hussars, in the excitement of a cavalry skirmish, crossed the north frontier of Schleswig into Denmark proper and occupied the town of Kolding. An invasion of Denmark itself had not been part of the original programme of the allies. Bismarck determined to use this circumstance to revise the whole situation. He urged upon Austria the necessity for a strong policy, to settle, comprehensively, the question of the duchies and the wider question of the German Confederation; Austria reluctantly consented to press the war.

The Austrian army decided to stop at the north frontier of Schleswig. Some Prussians moved against Kolding and Vejle. On 22 February 1864, Prussian troops attacked the Danish forward line at Dybbøl, pushing them back to the main defence line.

====March====
* 8 March: Bismarck pushed the Austrians into moving into Denmark proper.
* Austrian forces captured Vejle after fierce house-to-house combat. The Danish units involved retreated to Horsens and later to Vendsyssel. In Fredericia, the Danish 8th Brigade&#x27;s 20th Regiment was involved in a bigger skirmish: the regiment&#x27;s first Company were captured near Snoghøj, on the mainland near where the (old) Lillebælt bridge is now. The rest of Fredericia&#x27;s garrison retreated to Fyn.
* 15 March: Prussian siege artillery began to bombard the Danish fortifications at Dybbøl from positions at Broager.
* 17 March: The Prussian army drove back the Danish outposts in front of Dybbøl. In the naval Battle of Jasmund (also known as the Battle of Rügen), a Prussian naval force attempted to break the Danish naval blockade of Schleswig and Holstein, but was pushed back to Swinemünde.
* 22 March: A fresh agreement was signed between the powers, under which the compacts of 1852 were declared to be no longer valid, and the position of the duchies within the Danish monarchy as a whole was to be made the subject of a friendly understanding.
* 28 March: Dybbøl was again attacked, but in vain.

====April====

* 2 April: Prussian artillery began bombarding Danish fortifications at Dybbøl and the town of Sønderborg. By 18 April 1864, the Prussians fired about 65,000 shells.
* 4 April: Danes repelled a Prussian attack on Dybbøl.
* 18 April: The Battle of Dybbøl. After six hours of artillery preparations, 10,000 Prussian soldiers stormed Dybbøl fort at 10:00 am. The Danish 8th Brigade counterattacked bravely, but was defeated, with 1,700 Danish casualties. (18 April is a military memorial day in Denmark commemorating this defeat, including a ceremony on Dybbøl fort hill.)
* 25 April: The Danish army commanded by General Niels Christian Lunding, on direct order from the Minister of War, abandoned Fredericia, which was besieged by Austrians.
* 25 April – 25 June: The London Conference of 1864 discussed the political issues involved.

====May====

Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia became supreme commander of the Austro-Prussian allied army and conquered Jutland. 

* 9 May: Naval Battle of Helgoland.
* 12 May: The conference in London led to a ceasefire, which soon broke down, as they could not agree on a clear fixing of the boundaries; partitioning the duchy of Schleswig was seen as possible. War continued. Prussians from beside Dybbøl bombarded Sønderborg.
* 26 May: Prussian artillery fires on Als.

====June====

* 24 June: Seeing that the truce was ending, Austria and Prussia arrived at a new agreement, that the war was to completely separate the duchies from Denmark.
* 25 June: The conference in London broke up without having arrived at any conclusion.
* 29 June: The Danish garrison from Dybbøl had taken refuge on the island of Als. Prussians crossed from the mainland on boats on the evening of 29 June. Battle of Als. The Prussians carried the Danish entrenchments and captured the island under heavy fire. This was the last major engagement of the war.
* 30 June: The Prince&#x27;s Life Regiment was the last unit of the Danish army to leave Schleswig and Holstein.

====July====
* 3 July: A Danish force commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Beck attacks a Prussian force at Lundby south of Ålborg in the north of Jutland. See Battle of Lundby. This is the last battle in the Second Schleswig War.
* 14 July: The Prussian general Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein signed his name in the church book at Skagen at the north tip of Jutland. With this all of Jutland, the Danish mainland, was occupied by the Germans. Now the Danish islands were also endangered, and the Danish government again had to accept armistice and peace negotiations, now however under clearly more difficult conditions.

====August and after====

The preliminaries of a peace treaty were signed on 1 August 1864: the King of Denmark renounced all his rights in the duchies in favour of the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia.

In the Treaty of Vienna, 30 October 1864, Denmark ceded Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg to Prussia and Austria. Denmark was also forced to surrender the enclaves in western Schleswig that were legally part of Denmark proper and not part of Schleswig, but was allowed to keep the island of Ærø (which had been administered as part of Schleswig), the town of Ribe and its surrounding land, and eight parishes from Tyrstrup Herred south of Kolding. As a result of the peace settlement, the land area of the Danish monarchy decreased by 40% and the total population reduced from 2.6 million to 1.6 million (about 38.5%). The Danish frontier had retreated about 250 km as measured from the furthest corner of the Duchy of Lauenburg to the new frontier on the Kongeå river.

When the Danish army returned to Copenhagen after this war, they received no cheering or other public acclaim, unlike on their victorious return after the First Schleswig War.

==Aftermath==

In the Prussian forces&#x27; first clash of arms since reorganization, their effectiveness proved clear, something the Austrians ignored to their cost 18 months later in the Austro-Prussian War, and contributed to a perception in the German states that Prussia was the only state that could defend the other German states against external aggression. (See Unification of Germany.) Prussia and Austria took over the respective administration of Schleswig and Holstein under the Gastein Convention of 14 August 1865. About 200,000 Danes came under German rule.

Following the loss, Christian IX went behind the backs of the Danish government to contact the Prussians, offering that the whole of Denmark could join the German Confederation, if Denmark could stay united with Schleswig and Holstein. This proposal was rejected by Bismarck, who feared that the ethnic strife in Schleswig between Danes and Germans would then stay unresolved. Christian IX&#x27;s negotiations were not publicly known until published in the 2010 book &quot;Dommedag Als&quot; by Tom Buk-Swienty, who had been given access to the royal archives by Queen Margrethe II.

The Peace of Prague in 1866 confirmed Denmark&#x27;s cession of the two duchies, but promised a plebiscite to decide whether north Schleswig wished to return to Danish rule. This provision was unilaterally set aside by a resolution of Prussia and Austria in 1878.

The French control over the power arrangements in Germany, enjoyed by France for centuries (since Cardinal Richelieu), was lost, precipitating the rise of Germany that eventually culminated in the First World War.

===Effects on Denmark===
The war is generally considered to be a national trauma for Denmark.

Despite Charles XV&#x27;s promise to send troops, Sweden-Norway refused to aid Denmark. Consequently, the pan-Scandinavism movement focused henceforth on literature and language rather than political unification. Likewise, the war proved to be a diplomatic setback for the British government, whose attempts to mediate the conflict and deter Prussia were rebuffed.

The war also shocked Denmark out of any idea of using war as a political tool. Danish forces were not involved in war outside their frontiers until the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became clear that, against the might of Germany, Denmark could not assert her survival with her own arms; this played a crucial role in the &quot;adjustment policy&quot; and later &quot;Cooperation policy&quot; during the Nazi-German occupation in World War II.

From a Danish perspective, perhaps the most grievous consequence of the defeat was that thousands of Danes living in the ceded lands were conscripted into the Imperial German Army in World War I and suffered huge casualties on the Western Front. This is still (but waning in time as the children of the conscripted men are dying out) a cause of resentment among many families in the southern parts of Jutland and the direct reason why a German offer of a joint centenary anniversary in 1966 was rejected.

After the German Empire&#x27;s defeat in 1918, the Danish government asked the Allied Powers and the Versailles Conference of 1919 to include a plebiscite in the disputed Schleswig region based on Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points as part of the Allied Powers&#x27; peace settlement with Germany, and this request was granted by the Allies. As a result of the plebiscite, North Schleswig was returned to Denmark.

===Effects on Germany===
Bismarck&#x27;s triumph in the Schleswig War succeeded in winning the support of the Prussian liberals for his government. In the aftermath of the 1864 war, the liberal-dominated &quot;Landtag&quot; ended up submitting to Bismarck over the issue of the taxes that Bismarck had collected without the consent of the &quot;Landtag&quot;. The Second Schleswig war marked the beginning of the decline of Prussian liberalism as the British historian Brian Bond noted that German liberals otherwise opposed to Bismarck were &quot;extremely susceptible to the appeal of national unity achieved by force of arms&quot;. The victory of Prussia over Denmark was also the victory of the Prussian state over the liberal-dominated &quot;Landtag&quot; who caught up in the national euphoria of the victory over Denmark meekly submitted to Bismarck and voted to retroactively legalize the illegal taxes that Bismarck had imposed. The nationalism of the German liberals turned out to be stronger than their liberalism, and as a result of the 1864 war Prussian liberals generally ceased to oppose Bismarck and instead became his supporters. In particular, the way that Bismarck had imposed illegal taxes-which had once made him unpopular-was seen as a sign of his greatness, and Bismarck came to be celebrated for violating the 1850 constitution. In this way, Bismarck ended the liberal challenge to the Prussian state.

After his death in 1898, Bismarck came to be the subject of an immense personality cult in Germany, being portrayed as a super-human larger-than-life figure, the &quot;great redeemer&quot; who had finally achieved German unification. The German diplomat Count Harry Kessler wrote sadly in 1935 from his exile in France that by the beginning of the 20th century the German middle class had become so &quot;Bismarckian&quot; in their political views that &quot;a lethal atmosphere&quot; had been created to such an extent that anyone who had any views that were even remotely critical of the state that Bismarck had created was a pariah. In the Weimar Republic, German conservatives used the memory of Bismarck as a larger-than-life figure as a way to delegitimate the Weimar Republic as being &quot;against the spirit of Bismarck&quot;. In the German conservative narrative, the November Revolution of 1918 was portrayed not only as the alleged &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; that had caused Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War at the supposed moment when Germany was on the brink of winning the war, but also a rejection of Bismarck&#x27;s legacy. The fact that the people who founded the Weimar Republic were liberals, Social Democrats and the &quot;Zentrum&quot;-all groups whom Bismarck had denounced as &quot;enemies of the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;-was used to present the Weimar Republic as an illegitimate state that should not exist. Central to the conservative &quot;Bismarck cult&quot; narrative was the theme that democratic parliamentary government such as existed under the Weimar Republic was weak and ineffective, and what Germany needed was a &quot;der Führer&quot; (&quot;the Leader&quot;), a ruthless dictator who would do what was necessary to make Germany recognized as a powerful state. The way that Bismarck had imposed illegal taxes in 1862 which made it possible for Prussia to defeat Denmark in 1864 was presented in the &quot;Bismarck cult&quot; narrative as an example of the sort of leader that Germany needed who would break the law if necessary for the greater good of the Prussian-German state..

===Effects on humanitarian aid===

The Second Schleswig War was the first war to be fought after the establishment of the Red Cross movement in 1863. Both Denmark and Prussia had already established national Red Cross societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross sent observers to evaluate their work. Both Red Cross societies established hospitals and provided impartial care to wounded soldiers, and were covered in newspapers internationally. The war drew attention to the nascent Red Cross movement and drew volunteers to the movement.

==In popular culture==
Danish author Herman Bang wrote about the war and its effects on the island of Als in his novel &quot;Tine&quot;, published in 1889. The book has been translated into many languages, including English, and is considered to be an example of an impressionist novel.

In his novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1903), Irish novelist Erskine Childers refers to the Dybbøl, when protagonists Davies and Carruthers encounter the (then present) German victory monument during a stop at Sønderborg on their Baltic yachting expedition.

In the M. R. James short story &quot;Nr. 13&quot; references are made to the war. &quot;Is this,&quot; he said, &quot;the Danish courage I have heard so much of? It isn&#x27;t a German in there; and if it was, we are five to one.&quot;

The 2014 Danish TV series &quot;1864&quot; depicts the Second Schleswig War.

<text>Gołdap ( or variant &quot;Goldapp&quot;; ) is a spa town in northeastern Poland, in the region of Masuria, seat of Gołdap County in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. It is located on the Gołdapa River, between the Szeskie Hills, Gołdap Lake and the Puszcza Romincka forest. It has a population of 15,600 ().

==History==
===Early history===

Masurians began to settle the region in the 16th century while it was part of the Duchy of Prussia, a fief and part of the Kingdom of Poland. Systematic settlement began in 1565, while the town was officially founded by Caspar von Nostitz on May 15, 1570. Located at a profitable location on the crossing of several trade routes near the Prussian border with Lithuania, Gołdap grew rapidly. Its coat of arms depicts the House of Hohenzollern and Brandenburg, while the letter &quot;S&quot; stands for Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland, who was the suzerain of the region. In 1656, during the Polish-Swedish War, Polish troops under command of Dymitr Jerzy Wiśniowiecki were stationed in Gołdap.

The town became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and Germany in 1871. Between 1757 and 1762 it was occupied by Russians.

From 1709 to 1711 eastern Prussia suffered from a plague. The deceased were replaced by Germans from Brandenburg, Pomerania, Magdeburg, Halberstadt, the Electorate of the Palatinate, and Nassau, as well as Swiss and Lithuanians. In 1732 Protestants expelled from Salzburg also resettled the area. In the 19th century Gołdap&#x27;s population consisted mainly of Poles, Lithuanians and Germans, mostly Protestants. Lutheran services took place in all three languages. In 1831, the Polish pastor&#x27;s house was burnt down.

In 1807, Polish troops of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski were stationed in the town. In 1863, Poles smuggled weapons through the town to the Russian Partition of Poland to support the January Uprising.

In the 18th and 19th centuries Goldap was a notable centre of commerce and production of various goods for the local market, as well as an important centre of grain production. In 1818 it became a seat of Landkreis Goldap. In 1825, the county (including the town) had 24,911 inhabitants, including (by mother tongue): 17,412 (~70%) German, 3,940 (~16%) Polish and 3,559 (~14%) Lithuanian. In 1879 the town was linked to a railway.

===World War I and II===
During World War I Goldap was a scene of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, which passed through the town twice. As a result, it was almost completely destroyed. The town was rebuilt, and soon after the war ended it reached a similar number of inhabitants it had had before.

During World War II Goldap was planned by the German staff as one of the strongholds guarding the rest of East Prussia from the Red Army on the Eastern Front. As a result of heavy fighting for the city and the regions directly east of it, in August and September 1944, 90% of the town was yet again destroyed. According to German war-time reports, about 50 civilians were murdered (some raped) by the Red Army on its initial entry into Goldap in October 1944. It was the first town of Nazi Germany to fall. However, in November 1944 the Wehrmacht reconquered Goldap and would be able to keep it until the end of December of the same year. In January, the German positions in far-eastern East Prussia collapsed completely.

===Post-war Poland===

After German surrender, the Soviets ceremoniously transferred sovereignty over the town to Polish authorities on June 10, 1945. The already established Polish rule was accepted at the Potsdam Conference, however, on preliminary terms. The town was renamed to its historic Polish name &quot;Gołdap&quot; and rebuilt. The town retained its status as a seat of a powiat until 1975, when all powiats were abolished. After their re-establishment in 1999, Gołdap was not restored as a county seat, being instead assigned in the years 1999-2001 to the Olecko-Gołdap County. The town has subsequently reclaimed the original status, following re-establishment of a standalone Gołdap County.

Today the town of Gołdap remains an important centre of local trade and commerce. There are several small food production facilities (milk plant, industrial slaughterhouse, mill) located there, as well as a paper mill and a small tourist equipment works. In addition, it is one of the centres of tourism, with many skiing, swimming, sailing and leisure centres located both in the town and around it.

<text>Catie Curtis (born May 22, 1965) is an American singer-songwriter working primarily in the folk rock idiom. Her most recent album recording, &quot;The Raft,&quot; was released in 2020.

==Career==
Curtis was raised in Saco, Maine. By the age of fifteen she was playing drums for a local theater company and in her late teens she sat in with Foreigner on a performance of &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;. She graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island with a degree in history and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where she began working the folk rock circuit.

Curtis self-released the cassette-only &quot;Dandelion&quot; in 1989; her first CD, &quot;From Years to Hours&quot;, in 1991; and her second CD, &quot;Truth from Lies&quot;, in 1995. She did not gain wide recognition, however, until a successful appearance at The Bottom Line in New York City led to a contract with EMI/Guardian Records and the re-release of &quot;Truth from Lies&quot; in 1996. Her 1997 follow-up, &quot;Catie Curtis&quot;, was named Album of the Year at that year&#x27;s Gay and Lesbian American Music Awards. Her discography now runs to thirteen albums, including the highly regarded &quot;A Crash Course in Roses&quot; (1999).

<text>National Instruments Corporation, doing business as NI, is an American multinational company with international operations. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it is a producer of automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. Common applications include data acquisition, instrument control and machine vision. Following its acquisition by Emerson Electric, NI has operated the company’s test and measurement business unit since October 2023.

In 2022, the company sold products to more than 35,000 companies with revenues of US$1.66 billion.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In the early 1970s, James Truchard, Jeff Kodosky, and Bill Nowlin were employed at the University of Texas at Austin Applied Research Laboratories. While working on a project for the U.S. Navy, they utilized early computer technology to collect and analyze data. Frustrated by the inefficient data collection methods at their disposal, the trio decided to create a new product for this purpose. In 1976, while working in Truchard&#x27;s garage, they founded a new company. They initially attempted to incorporate under various names, including Longhorn Instruments and Texas Digital, but all were rejected. Ultimately, they settled on the name National Instruments.

With a $10,000 loan from Interfirst Bank, the group purchased a PDP-11/04 minicomputer and embarked on their first project by designing and building a GPIB interface for it. Their initial sale stemmed from a cold call to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. At that time, the three founders were still employed at the University of Texas. 

In 1977, they took a significant step by hiring their first full-time employee, Kim Harrison-Hosen, who was responsible for handling orders, billing, and customer inquiries. By the end of that year, they had sold three boards, and to encourage further business, the company produced and distributed a mailer to 15,000 users of the PDP-11 minicomputer. As sales began to rise, they were able to relocate to a dedicated office space in 1978, occupying a 600-square-foot office at 9513 Burnet Road in Austin.

=== 1980s ===
At the end of the 1970s, the company booked $400,000 in orders, recording a $60,000 profit. In 1980, Truchard, Kodosky, and Nowlin quit their jobs to devote themselves full-time to National Instruments. At the end of the year, they moved the company to a larger office, renting of office space. To assist in generating revenue, the company undertook numerous special projects, including a fuel-pump credit-card system and a waveform generator for U.S. Navy sonar acoustic testing. In 1981, the company reached the $1 million sales mark, leading them to move to a office in 1982.

In 1983, National Instruments developed their first GPIB board to connect instruments to IBM PCs. With the arrival of the Macintosh computer, Kodosky began a research initiative with the assistance of student researchers at the University of Texas into ways to exploit the new interface. This led to the creation of NI&#x27;s flagship product, the LabVIEW graphical development platform for the Macintosh computer, which was released in 1986. The software allows engineers and scientists to program graphically by &quot;wiring&quot; icons together instead of typing text-based code. The following year, a version of LabVIEW, known as LabWindows, was released for the DOS environment.

The company had 100 employees by 1986. NI opened its first international branch in Tokyo in 1987.

=== 1990s ===

After growing their staff enough to take over almost the entire building they were renting, in 1990, NI moved to a new building at 6504 Bridge Point Parkway, which the company purchased in 1991. The building, located along Lake Austin near the Loop 360 Bridge, became known as &quot;Silicon Hills = Bridge Point.&quot;

NI received their first patent for LabVIEW in 1991. Later in the same year, they introduced Signal Conditioning eXtensions for Instrumentation (SCXI) to expand the signal-processing capabilities of the PC, and in 1992, LabVIEW was first released for Windows-based PCs and Unix workstations. NI also created the National Instruments Alliance Partner program. In 1993, the company reached the milestone of $100 million in annual sales. To attract C/C++ programmers, later that year, NI introduced LabWindows/CVI. The following year, an employee began experiments with the relatively new World Wide Web and developed natinst.com, the company&#x27;s very first web page.

The company began to run out of room on their approximately campus. In 1994, NI broke ground on a new campus, located at a site along North Mopac Boulevard in northern Austin. By this time, NI had reached 1,000 employees. The new NI campus, which opened in 1998, was designed to be employee-friendly. It contains dedicated &quot;play&quot; areas, including basketball and volleyball courts, an employee gym, and a campus-wide walking trail. Each of the buildings on the campus is lined with windows and features an open floor plan. &quot;Dr. T&quot;, as the employees call their CEO, sits in an open cubicle and does not have an assigned parking space. Employees had been granted stock in the privately held company as part of their compensation packages. When the company chose to go public in 1995, over 300 current and former employees owned stock. The company was listed on the Nasdaq exchange as NATI.

By the late 1990s, the more advanced DAQ boards were provided by the company, which could replace vendor-defined instruments with a custom PC-based system. With the company&#x27;s acquisition of Georgetown Systems Lookout software, NI products were further incorporated into applications run on the factory-floor. By 1996, the company had reached $200 million in annual sales and was named to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 200 Best Small Companies list. Over the next several years, NI released machine vision software and hardware. NI also introduced the CompactPCI-based PXI, an open industry standard for modular measurement and automation, and NI TestStand, which provides for tracking high-volume manufacturing tests.

=== 2000s ===
User traffic and e-commerce rapidly improved after the company acquired the ni.com domain and began investing in web technologies. They introduced NI Developer Zone, which provides end-user developers access to example programs, sample code, and development tips, as well as forums for users and NI employees.

In the 2000s, NI began exporting most of its manufacturing overseas by opening its manufacturing plant in Debrecen, Hungary. NI now manufactures nearly 90% of its production in Debrecen and has expanded several times in the last decade. In 2011, with a multimillion-dollar grant from the government, NI increased production in Debrecen by approximately 20%. With state-of-the-art automation processes, headcount increased by only 2%. In 2002, the company dedicated the Building C on their Mopac campus, which became the headquarters for the company&#x27;s R&amp;D operations. Upon completion of this building, the NI campus finally had enough capacity to move all Austin-based employees to a single location.

Following the company model of selling directly to customers, by 2006, NI had opened 21 sales offices in Europe and 12 offices in the Asia/Pacific region, as well as a multitude of offices in the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East. Research and Development centers are located in the United States, Germany, India, Romania, China, Canada, and Malaysia.

In 2005 NI acquired Measurement Computing, a provider of low-cost data acquisition products.

===2010s===
In January 2013, National Instruments acquired all outstanding shares of Digilent Inc., which became a wholly owned subsidiary. Digilent was founded in 2000 by two Washington State University electrical engineering professors, Clint Cole and Gene Apperson, and grew to become a multinational corporation with sales of test and development products to universities. Digilent developed the open standard Pmod Interface.

===2020s===
On June 16, 2020, National Instruments announced that they were officially changing the company&#x27;s name to &quot;NI&quot;. On May 4, 2021, NI announced the acquisition of monoDrive, a provider of simulation software for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle development. In March 2022, it was announced that NI had completed the acquisition of Heinzinger Automotive GmbH, the electronic vehicle systems business of Rosenheim-based Heinzinger Electronic GmbH.

After months of failed negotiations to purchase NI, industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric announced a hostile takeover bid for NI in an appeal directly to shareholders in early 2023. In April 2023, NI agreed to be sold for $8.2billion in an all-cash deal. which was completed in October 2023. Within Emerson, NI now operate as a new Test &amp; Measurement business group, headquartered in Austin, Texas.

== Groups ==

=== Electronics Workbench Group ===
The National Instruments Electronics Workbench Group is responsible for creating the electronic circuit design software NI Multisim and NI Ultiboard, which was previously a Canada-based company that first produced MultiSIM, and integrated ULTIboard with it.

Interactive Image Technologies was founded in Toronto, Ontario, by Joe Koenig, and specializes in producing educational movies and documentaries. When the government of Ontario needed an educational tool for teaching electronics in colleges, the company created a circuit simulator called the &quot;Electronics Workbench&quot;. In 1996, Interactive Image Technologies appointed its vice president, Roy Bryant, as Chief Operating Officer to oversee the day-to-day operations of the company and to grow the company&#x27;s electronic design automation (EDA) products. Bryant is credited with &quot;overseeing the development and marketing of the company&#x27;s Electronics Workbench EDA product&quot;. In 1998, the company started a strategic partnership with another electronic design automation company named Ultimate Technology from Naarden, Netherlands, who was the European market leader in printed circuit board design software, with their package ULTIboard. Like Electronics Workbench, founder James Post gained PR fame when he organized the distribution of 180,000 demo floppy disks via electronics magazines in Europe.

In 1999, the companies merged and renamed themselves after their most well known product, the Electronics Workbench. Then the product line consisted of schematic capture, simulation product named MultiSIM and printed circuit board software called Ultiboard.

In 2005, the company was acquired by National Instruments and rebranded as National Instruments Electronics Workbench Group.

== Community ==
Beginning in 1995, National Instruments has held an annual developer conference in Austin, NIWeek. The week-long conference was held at the Austin Convention Center. Activities there were presented both by NI employees and external presenters. An exhibition hall allows selected industry integrators and suppliers to showcase their products, and various customers or university students also present papers on their work with NI tools.

<text> (; 1881 or 19 December 1882 – 20 November 1935) was a Syrian Muslim preacher and a leader in the local struggles against British and French Mandatory rule in the Levant and an opponent of Zionism in the 1920s and 1930s.

Qassam was born in Jableh, Syrian province of the Ottoman Empire in 1882. He studied at Al-Azhar University in Egypt and afterward became an Islamic revivalist preacher in his hometown. Following his return, he became an active supporter of the Libyan resistance to the Italian occupation starting 1911, raising funds and fighters to aid the Libyans and penning an anthem for them. He would later lead his own group of rebels in alliance with Ibrahim Hananu to fight against the French Mandate in northern Syria ratified on 29 September 1923.

Following the rebels&#x27; defeat, he immigrated to Palestine, where he became a Muslim &quot;waqf&quot; (religious endowment) official and grew incensed at the plight of Palestinian Arab peasants. He advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine. In the 1930s, he formed bands of local fighters, including the Black Hand, and launched attacks against British and Jewish targets. He was eventually killed in a manhunt by the British authorities in 1935, following his alleged role in the killing of a policeman. Israeli historian Tom Segev has called him &#x27;the Arab Joseph Trumpeldor&#x27;. His campaign and death were factors that led to the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.

==Early life and Islamic scholarship==

Al-Qassam was born in Jableh, northwestern Syria, to father Abd al-Qadar, a sharia court official during Ottoman rule and a local leader of the Qadariyya Sufi order. His grandfather had been a leading sheikh of the Qadariyya order and moved to Jableh from Iraq. Al-Qassam also followed the Hanafi school of &quot;fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence) of Sunni Islam and studied at the local Istambuli Mosque under the teaching of well-known &quot;′alim&quot; (scholar) Sheikh Salim Tayarah.

Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam left for Cairo to study at the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by the sources; some accounts say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and came into contact with the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam&#x27;s relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well acquainted with the ideas that Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through &quot;jihad&quot; (holy struggle). He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an &quot;′alim&quot; and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya &quot;madrasa&quot; (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur&#x27;an. In addition, he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.

Following his return to Jableh, al-Qassam commenced a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular &quot;salaah&quot; (prayer) and the &quot;sawm&quot; (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam&#x27;s campaign highly influenced Jableh&#x27;s residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce sharia on rare cases of major violations. In some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of. Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al-Azhar and among Syrian notables, al-Qassam&#x27;s loyalties at the time most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as his relationship with the authorities would indicate. He was well regarded among much of Jableh&#x27;s population where he gained a reputation for piety, simple manners and good humor.

==Support for Libyan resistance==

Following Italy&#x27;s September 1911 invasion of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh for the joint Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh&#x27;s district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser, and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, the governor attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty, and the governor was consequently dismissed.

In June 1912, during one of his Friday prayer sermons, he called for volunteers to engage in a &quot;jihad&quot; against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman military training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as &quot;mujahideen&quot; (those who engage in &quot;jihad&quot;) when he arrived in Alexandretta in the latter part of that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam&#x27;s request was rejected by the authorities, who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state&#x27;s focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a &quot;madrasa&quot; in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.

==Anti-French resistance in Syria==

He later enlisted in the Ottoman army when World War I broke out, where he received military training and was attached as a chaplain to a base near Damascus. Returning to Jableh before the war&#x27;s end, al-Qassam used funds from his planned expedition to Libya to organize a local defense force to fight the French occupation. His principal role in the local resistance was financing the acquisition of weapons for Jableh&#x27;s militia. By 1919, French forces moved into the coastal area of northern Syria while Faisal I established the Kingdom of Syria in Damascus as an independent Arab state. During this period, al-Qassam&#x27;s Jableh militia fought against local French-backed Alawite militiamen who occupied areas around the city. The Alawites were eventually repelled, but French forces moved in soon after to consolidate their control. Consequently, al-Qassam and many of his disciples left Jableh for Mount Sahyun where he established a base near the village of Zanqufeh to launch guerrilla raids against the French Army.

Al-Qassam&#x27;s militia grew when it was joined by another militia based in the mountains following the death of its commander Umar al-Bitar. However, as the French tightened their control of the area, they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh&#x27;s major landowners to drop their financial support for al-Qassam and pay taxes to the French Mandate government. This further isolated al-Qassam, who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920. There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu, who was leading attacks against the French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July. As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo, al-Qassam and members of his unit fled past French Army lines with forged passports to Tartus.

==Activism in Palestine==

===Establishment in Haifa===
From Tartus, al-Qassam travelled to Beirut by boat and then to Haifa, then under the British Mandate, where his wife and daughters later joined him. During the early 1920s, al-Qassam taught at the Madrasa Islamiya, an Islamic educational institution with many schools in Haifa and its periphery. It was funded by the Jamiat Islamiya, a &quot;waqf&quot; (religious endowment) administered by prominent Muslims from the city. Unlike other Muslim scholars, al-Qassam made himself easily accessible to the public and often arrived late to teach his classes because he was frequently stopped by passersby for advice. He resigned from his teaching career due to the school&#x27;s insistence that he maintain consistent hours. As part of his Islamic revivalist teaching, he denounced and discouraged some local Palestinian traditions, including unorthodox funeral rituals, mothers&#x27; visitation to the al-Khidr shrine on nearby Mount Carmel to give thanks for their children&#x27;s well-being or achievements and tribal dances around religious sites, as superstitious innovations to Islam.

Al-Qassam concentrated his activities on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual labourers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jurayneh Mosque, and later in the Istiqlal Mosque (both of which still exist in Haifa&#x27;s Lower City). He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labour policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine&#x27;s poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.

In 1929, he was appointed the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the &quot;waqf&quot; authorities in Jerusalem, a role that allowed him to tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam wasAn individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam&#x27;s pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at the ways in which the old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.

He also took advantage of his travels to deliver fiery political and religious sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organise resistance units to attack the British and Jews. He intensified his agitation and obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of Damascus, which ruled that the struggle against the British and the Jews was permissible.

===Relationship with local leaders===
According to Israeli historian Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often cooperated with Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam&#x27;s various official appointments required the mufti&#x27;s prior consent. Lachman suggests that their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, in which one source claims al-Qassam&#x27;s men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam&#x27;s independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter&#x27;s participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.

From 1928 until his death, al-Qassam served as the president of the Young Men&#x27;s Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam&#x27;s cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.

===Organisation of armed resistance groups===

In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had recruited numerous hand-picked followers and organised them into about a dozen different circles, each group of supporters unaware of the existence of the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban labourers. The majority of al-Qassam&#x27;s circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military &quot;jihad&quot; as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.

In training his men, al-Qassam stressed that maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should provide for the needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties with their families and pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam&#x27;s teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa&#x27;s labour slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to &quot;jihad&quot; and to carry a Qur&#x27;an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur&#x27;an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.

The guerrilla bands became known as the Black Hand (&quot;al-kaff al-aswad&quot;), an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organisation. The idea for such a group appeared to have crystallised after the 1929 riots. From the outset, a split occurred in the movement. One faction led by Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir argued for immediate attacks against British and Jewish targets, while the other faction, headed by al-Qassam, thought than an armed revolt was premature and risked exposing the group&#x27;s preparations. According to Subhi Yasin, a comrade of al-Qassam, the group&#x27;s attacks in the north were executed by Abu Ibrahim&#x27;s group in defiance of al-Qassam, though in 1969, Abu Ibrahim denied this allegation. The Black Hand&#x27;s ensuing campaign began with the ambush and killing of three members of Kibbutz Yagur on 11 April 1931, a failed bomb attack on outlying Jewish homes in Haifa in early 1932, and several operations that killed or wounded four members of northern Jewish settlements. The campaign climaxed with the deaths of a Jewish father and son in Nahalal, from a bomb thrown into their home, on 22 December 1932.

By 1935, al-Qassam had recruited several hundred men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organised in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-built rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, al-Qassam&#x27;s movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.

==Death==
On 8 November 1935 the body of a Palestine Police constable, Moshe Rosenfeld, was discovered near Ein Harod. Al-Qassam and his followers were believed to have been responsible and search parties set out to capture him. In this context, al-Qassam and twelve of his men decided to go underground and, leaving Haifa, took to the hills between Jenin and Nablus. There they spent ten days on the move, during which they were fed by the residents of villages in the area. The British police manhunt eventually surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya&#x27;bad, in the village of Sheikh Zeid. In the long ensuing firefight, al-Qassam and three of his followers were killed, and five captured on 20 November.

The manner of his last stand galvanized Palestinians at the time, according to American historian Abdallah Schleifer:

Surrounded, he told his men to die as martyrs, and opened fire. His defiance and manner of his death (which stunned the traditional leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.

To the surprise of the Palestine Police Force, al-Qassam&#x27;s funeral, which was held at the Jerini Mosque, attracted at least 3,000 mourners, mostly members of the peasant and working classes. His coffin and those of his slain comrades were draped in the flags of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, the only three independent Arab countries at the time. In reaction to al-Qassam&#x27;s death, strikes were held in Haifa and several Palestinian and Syrian cities. Al-Qassam is buried at the Muslim cemetery at the former Palestinian village of Balad al-Sheikh, now Nesher, a Jewish suburb of Haifa. An obituary for al-Qassam was published in the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; on 22 November, eulogizing him as a &quot;martyr&quot; with the following statement: &quot;I heard you preaching from up in the pulpit, summoning to the sword ... Through your death you are more eloquent than ever you were in life.&quot;

==Legacy==
Five months after al-Qassam&#x27;s death, members of his movement, known as &quot;Qassamiyun&quot; or &quot;Qassamites&quot;, also &quot;Ikhwan al-Qassam&quot;,
(the Brothers of al-Qassam) under the leadership of Farhan al-Sa&#x27;di, al-Qassam&#x27;s spiritual heir, shot and killed two Jewish passengers on a bus and shot three Jewish drivers, killing two, in the 1936 Anabta shooting, acts that became major contributing factors in the start of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Peasant and urban guerrilla factions (&quot;fasa&#x27;il&quot;) led by the Qassamiyun played a significant role in commencing the countrywide revolt. At the start of the revolt, al-Qassam&#x27;s close disciples al-Sa&#x27;di, Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir, and Attiyah Ahmad Awad led &quot;fasa&#x27;il&quot; in the Jenin region, the Upper Galilee and Balad al-Sheikh, respectively.

Al-Qassam, according to Palestinian-American Rashid Khalidi,
played a crucial role in winning the populace away from the elite-brokered politics of compromise with the British, and in showing them the &quot;correct&quot; path of popular armed struggle against the British and the Zionists.

The first Israeli prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, compared the glory that al-Qassam&#x27;s actions aroused in the 1930s to the fame won in Zionist discourse by Zionist activist Joseph Trumpeldor who died in a battle with Arab forces. Recalling this, Israeli historian Tom Segev has argued that &quot;The terrorists that al-Qassam led and the intifada fighters, more recently, may also be likened to the terrorists that Menachem Begin led.&quot;

Although al-Qassam&#x27;s revolt was unsuccessful in his lifetime, militant organizations gained inspiration from his example. His funeral drew thousands, which turned into a mass demonstration of national unity. The Palestinian fedayeen who emerged in the 1960s saw al-Qassam as their originator. The founders of the Palestinian nationalist armed movement Fatah had initially considered naming their group the &quot;Qassamiyun&quot;. Leila Khaled, a well-known member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, once stated that her organization began &quot;where al-Qassam left off: his generation started the revolution, my generation intends to finish it.&quot;

In his speech from Bint Jbeil celebrating the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon on 24 May 2000, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addressed the Palestinians saying:

Our people in Palestine, your destiny lies within your reach, and you can retain your land with your will, with Ezzeddine Al-Qassam&#x27;s choice, and with the blood of Fathi Shaqaqi and Yahya Ayyash. You can retain your land without receiving the favor of an alley here or a village there that the Zionists can give you. You can bring your families back home with pride and esteem, begging none. Even in case the whole world renounces you, you can retain your land and legitimate rights.

The military wing of the Palestinian Islamist armed movement Hamas, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, bears his name as does the Qassam rocket, a short-range rocket the group produces and uses.

<doc id="554247" wikidata="Q332506" url="?curid=554247" title="Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest">
<text>Belgium has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 65 times since making its debut as one of seven countries at the first contest in . The only countries with more appearances are (67), (66) and the (66). Belgium have been absent only three times in total, in , , and , due to low scores in the previous contests that relegated them from the contest. Belgium has won the contest once, in .

In the first 20 years of the contest, Belgium&#x27;s best result was a fourth place with &quot; performed by Tonia in . In , &quot; by Jean Vallée achieved Belgium&#x27;s first top three placement, when it was second. &quot;&quot; became the first and to date only win for Belgium in 1986, performed by a 13-year-old Sandra Kim. Belgium&#x27;s only other top three result came in , when &quot;Sanomi&quot; by Urban Trad finished second, losing out by only two points. Belgium has finished last in the contest eight times, most recently in , and has twice received &quot;nul points&quot;, in and .

After the introduction of the semi-finals in , Belgium failed to reach the final for five consecutive years (2005–09). Since 2010, Belgium has become more successful, qualifying for the final in eight out of 14 contests and placing in the top ten five times, with &quot;Me and My Guitar&quot; by Tom Dice (sixth in ), &quot;Rhythm Inside&quot; by Loïc Nottet (fourth in ), &quot;What&#x27;s the Pressure&quot; by Laura Tesoro (tenth in ), &quot;City Lights&quot; by Blanche (fourth in ), and &quot;Because of You&quot; by Gustaph (seventh in ).

==Participation==
Belgium is a federal country divided into two major linguistic regions: Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north and French-speaking Wallonia in the south, each region having its own broadcaster: (VRT) in Flanders and (RTBF) in Wallonia. Both broadcasters are full members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), thus eligible to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. As only one entrant per country is allowed in the contest in any given year, they take turns in participate representing Belgium. Since 2021, Flemish VRT has been in charge on odd years while Walloon RTBF has been in charge on even years, with both broadcasters sharing the broadcasting rights.

==Contest history==
Belgium has participated in Eurovision since the very first contest in , however Tonia&#x27;s fourth place at the contest remained the country&#x27;s most notable achievement until Jean Vallée placed second in . In the 80s, following good results for Stella (fourth in ) and Jacques Zegers (fifth in ), Belgium finished last for the sixth time in . This was followed by Belgium&#x27;s first and () only Eurovision victory in 1986, when Sandra Kim won with her song &quot;J&#x27;aime la vie&quot;. Although the lyrics claimed she was 15 years old, she was actually only 13 which prompted runner-up Switzerland to petition for her disqualification, to no avail. By winning in 1986, Belgium became the last of the seven Eurovision founding countries to win the contest, as Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, Italy and Germany all had won at least once before. Belgium scored an absolute record at the time, with Kim earning a never-seen-before number of 176 points (that record remained until 1993, with Ireland scoring 187 points). With an average of 9.26 points per voting nation and 77.2% of the maximum possible score, , Kim&#x27;s record still ranks eighth among all Eurovision winners.

Belgium finished last for the seventh time at the contest, before achieving its only top ten result of the 90s decade at the contest, where Mélanie Cohl finished sixth. In the 2000s, Belgium experienced mixed fortunes: the country started the decade by finishing last for the eighth and () final time at the contest in Stockholm, before achieving its best result of the 21st century in 2003 when Urban Trad sang in an imaginary language and earned second place with 165 points, losing out to Turkey&#x27;s Sertab Erener by just two points. The country then failed to qualify from the semi-finals for 5 consecutive contests from 2005 to 2009.

The entry for Belgium was Tom Dice, runner-up of the Belgian Flemish version of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2008. Dice finished first in his semi-final, allowing Belgium to participate in the final for the first time since 2004 and eventually finishing sixth overall, Belgium&#x27;s best result since 2003 and the best result ever for a Flemish entrant (tied with ). Belgium then experienced a mix of ups and downs for the remainder of the 2010s: while the country failed to qualify for the final on five occasions (in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019), Belgium qualified in 2013 (with Roberto Bellarosa placing 12th) before scoring a three-year streak in the top ten, thanks to Loïc Nottet (fourth in ), Laura Tesoro (tenth in ) and Blanche (fourth in ). Following two non-qualifications with Sennek () and Eliot (), Belgium recorded three consecutive qualifications with Hooverphonic (), Jérémie Makiese () and Gustaph (), the latter finishing in seventh place overall.

=== Disparity between broadcasters ===
There has been a significant difference in the results achieved by the Belgian participant broadcasters. The Walloon broadcasters recorded Belgium&#x27;s only win in , all of Belgium&#x27;s ten top-five placements, and 18 out of Belgium&#x27;s 26 top ten placements. On the other hand, the Flemish broadcasters have placed in the top ten eight times, while scoring six out of Belgium&#x27;s eight last-place finishes. In the 1990s, the relegation rule was introduced, where the lowest-placing countries would not be allowed to compete the following year, to accommodate for the growing number of participating countries. Belgium was relegated three times, in , , and ; twice following a poor placing by a Flemish BRTN act the previous year, and once after Walloon RTBF act, &quot;&quot; by Nathalie Sorce, placed last in 2000.

Since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, the broadcasters have scored similarly in terms of qualification: , RTBF and VRT each qualified four times out of ten and nine semi-finals respectively.

===Commentators and spokespersons===
Over the years, commentary for the contest on VRT and RTBF has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including Piet de Nuyl Jr., Jacques Mercier, Luc Appermont and Paule Herreman. From 1991, André Vermeulen provided the Dutch-language commentary every year except 1996. Jean-Pierre Hautier provided French-language commentary from 1994 to 2012, later dying shortly after the 2012 contest. In 1962, BRT retransmitted the commentary feed from the Dutch broadcaster NTS, possibly for financial reasons.

VRT supplied an additional commentator to join André Vermeulen starting in 1998; between 1999 and 2010, dual commentary was provided by either Bart Peeters or Anja Daems. Peeters provided the commentary during the years when VRT selected the entries, whilst Daems commentated the years in which RTBF selected the entries. Sven Pichal replaced Daems in 2011, whilst Peter Van de Veire replaced Peeters. In 2007, Jean-Louis Lahaye joined Jean-Pierre Hautier as a supplementary commentator for RTBF. After Hautier&#x27;s death in 2012, Lahaye was joined by Maureen Louys in 2013.

<doc id="554248" wikidata="Q2478109" url="?curid=554248" title="Nonholonomic system">
<text>A nonholonomic system in physics and mathematics is a physical system whose state depends on the path taken in order to achieve it. Such a system is described by a set of parameters subject to differential constraints and non-linear constraints, such that when the system evolves along a path in its parameter space (the parameters varying continuously in values) but finally returns to the original set of parameter values at the start of the path, the system itself may not have returned to its original state. Nonholonomic mechanics is an autonomous division of Newtonian mechanics.

==Details==
More precisely, a nonholonomic system, also called an &quot;anholonomic&quot; system, is one in which there is a continuous closed circuit of the governing parameters, by which the system may be transformed from any given state to any other state. Because the final state of the system depends on the intermediate values of its trajectory through parameter space, the system cannot be represented by a conservative potential function as can, for example, the inverse square law of the gravitational force. This latter is an example of a holonomic system: path integrals in the system depend only upon the initial and final states of the system (positions in the potential), completely independent of the trajectory of transition between those states. The system is therefore said to be &quot;integrable&quot;, while the nonholonomic system is said to be &quot;nonintegrable&quot;. When a path integral is computed in a nonholonomic system, the value represents a deviation within some range of admissible values and this deviation is said to be an &quot;anholonomy&quot; produced by the specific path under consideration. This term was introduced by Heinrich Hertz in 1894.

The general character of anholonomic systems is that of implicitly dependent parameters. If the implicit dependency can be removed, for example by raising the dimension of the space, thereby adding at least one additional parameter, the system is not truly nonholonomic, but is simply incompletely modeled by the lower-dimensional space. In contrast, if the system intrinsically cannot be represented by independent coordinates (parameters), then it is truly an anholonomic system. Some authors make much of this by creating a distinction between so-called internal and external states of the system, but in truth, all parameters are necessary to characterize the system, be they representative of &quot;internal&quot; or &quot;external&quot; processes, so the distinction is in fact artificial. However, there is a very real and irreconcilable difference between physical systems that obey conservation principles and those that do not. In the case of parallel transport on a sphere, the distinction is clear: a Riemannian manifold has a metric fundamentally distinct from that of a Euclidean space. For parallel transport on a sphere, the implicit dependence is intrinsic to the non-euclidean metric. The surface of a sphere is a two-dimensional space. By raising the dimension, we can more clearly see the nature of the metric, but it is still fundamentally a two-dimensional space with parameters irretrievably entwined in dependency by the Riemannian metric.

By contrast, one can consider an X-Y plotter as an example of a holonomic system where the state of the system&#x27;s mechanical components will have a single fixed configuration for any given position of the plotter pen. If the pen relocates between positions 0,0 and 3,3, the mechanism&#x27;s gears will have the same final positions regardless of whether the relocation happens by the mechanism first incrementing 3 units on the x-axis and then 3 units on the y-axis, incrementing the Y-axis position first, or operating any other sequence of position-changes that result in a final position of 3,3. Since the final state of the machine is the same regardless of the path taken by the plotter-pen to get to its new position, the end result can be said not to be &quot;path-dependent&quot;. If we substitute a turtle plotter, the process of moving the pen from 0,0 to 3,3 can result in the gears of the robot&#x27;s mechanism finishing in different positions depending on the path taken to move between the two positions. See this very similar gantry crane example for a mathematical explanation of why such a system is holonomic.

==History==
N. M. Ferrers first suggested to extend the equations of motion with nonholonomic constraints in 1871.
He introduced the expressions for Cartesian velocities in terms of generalized velocities.
In 1877, E. Routh wrote the equations with the Lagrange multipliers. In the third edition of his book for linear non-holonomic constraints of rigid bodies, he introduced the form with multipliers, which is now called the Lagrange equations of the second kind with multipliers. The terms the holonomic and nonholonomic systems were introduced by Heinrich Hertz in 1894.
In 1897, S. A. Chaplygin first suggested to form the equations of motion without Lagrange multipliers.
Under certain linear constraints, he introduced on the left-hand side of the equations of motion a group of extra terms of the Lagrange-operator type.
The remaining extra terms characterise the nonholonomicity of system and they become zero when the given constrains are integrable.
In 1901 P. V.Voronets generalised Chaplygin&#x27;s work to the cases of noncyclic holonomic coordinates 
and of nonstationary constraints.

==Constraints==
Consider a system of formula_1 particles with positions formula_2 for formula_3 with respect to a given reference frame. In classical mechanics, any constraint that is not expressible as
formula_4

is a non-holonomic constraint. In other words, a nonholonomic constraint is nonintegrable and in Pfaffian form:
formula_5
*formula_6 is the number of coordinates.
*formula_7 is the number of constraint equations.
*formula_8 are coordinates.
*formula_9 are coefficients.

In order for the above form to be nonholonomic, it is also required that the left hand side neither be a total differential nor be able to be converted into one, perhaps via an integrating factor.

For virtual displacements only, the differential form of the constraint is
formula_10

It is not necessary for all non-holonomic constraints to take this form, in fact it may involve higher derivatives or inequalities. A classical example of an inequality constraint is that of a particle placed on the surface of a sphere, yet is allowed to fall off it:
formula_11
*formula_12 is the distance of the particle from the centre of the sphere.
*formula_13 is the radius of the sphere.

==Examples==
===Rolling wheel===
A wheel (sometimes visualized as a unicycle or a rolling coin) is a nonholonomic system.

====Layperson&#x27;s explanation====
Consider the wheel of a bicycle that is parked in a certain place (on the ground). Initially the inflation valve is at a certain position on the wheel. If the bicycle is ridden around, and then parked in &quot;exactly&quot; the same place, the valve will almost certainly not be in the same position as before. Its new position depends on the path taken. If the wheel were holonomic, then the valve stem would always end up in the same position as long as the wheel were always rolled back to the same location on the Earth. Clearly, however, this is not the case, so the system is nonholonomic.

====Mathematical explanation====
It is possible to model the wheel mathematically with a system of constraint equations, and then prove that that system is nonholonomic.

First, we define the configuration space. The wheel can change its state in three ways: having a different rotation about its axle, having a different steering angle, and being at a different location. We may say that formula_14 is the rotation about the axle, formula_15 is the steering angle relative to the formula_16-axis, and formula_16 and formula_18 define the spatial position. Thus, the configuration space is:
formula_19

We must now relate these variables to each other. We notice that as the wheel changes its rotation, it changes its position. The change in rotation and position implying velocities must be present, we attempt to relate angular velocity and steering angle to linear velocities by taking simple time-derivatives of the appropriate terms:
formula_20
The velocity in the formula_16 direction is equal to the angular velocity times the radius times the cosine of the steering angle, and the formula_18 velocity is similar. Now we do some algebraic manipulation to transform the equation to &quot;Pfaffian form&quot; so it is possible to test whether it is holonomic, starting with:
formula_23

Then, let&#x27;s separate the variables from their coefficients (left side of equation, derived from above). We also realize that we can multiply all terms by formula_24 so we end up with only the differentials (right side of equation):
formula_25
The right side of the equation is now in &quot;Pfaffian form&quot;:
formula_26

We now use the universal test for holonomic constraints. If this system were holonomic, we might have to do up to eight tests. However, we can use mathematical intuition to try our best to prove that the system is nonholonomic on the &quot;first&quot; test. Considering the test equation is:
formula_27

we can see that if any of the terms formula_28, formula_29, or formula_30 were zero, then that part of the test equation would be trivial to solve and would be equal to zero. Therefore, it is often best practice to have the first test equation have as many non-zero terms as possible to maximize the chance of the sum of them not equaling zero. Therefore, we choose:
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33
:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36

We substitute into our test equation:
formula_37

and simplify:
formula_38

We can easily see that this system, as described, is nonholonomic, because formula_39 is not always equal to zero.

=====Additional conclusions=====
We have completed our proof that the system is nonholonomic, but our test equation gave us some insights about whether the system, if further constrained, could be holonomic. Many times test equations will return a result like formula_40 implying the system could never be constrained to be holonomic without radically altering the system, but in our result we can see that formula_41 &quot;can&quot; be equal to zero, in two different ways:
* formula_12, the radius of the wheel, can be zero. This is not helpful as the system in practice would lose all of its degrees of freedom.
* formula_39 can be zero by setting formula_15 equal to zero. This implies that if the wheel were not allowed to turn and had to move only in a straight line at all times, it would be a holonomic system.
There is one thing that we have not yet considered however, that to find all such modifications for a system, one must perform &quot;all&quot; eight test equations (four from each constraint equation) and collect &quot;all&quot; the failures to gather all requirements to make the system holonomic, if possible. In this system, out of the seven additional test equations, an additional case presents itself:
formula_45
This does not pose much difficulty, however, as adding the equations and dividing by formula_12 results in:
formula_47
which with some simple algebraic manipulation becomes:
formula_48

which has the solution formula_49 (from formula_50).

Refer back to the layman&#x27;s explanation above where it is said, &quot;[The valve stem&#x27;s] new position depends on the path taken. If the wheel were holonomic, then the valve stem would always end up in the same position as long as the wheel were always rolled back to the same location on the Earth. Clearly, however, this is not the case, so the system is nonholonomic.&quot; However it is easy to visualize that if the wheel were only allowed to roll in a perfectly straight line and back, the valve stem &quot;would&quot; end up in the same position! In fact, moving parallel to the given angle of formula_51 is not actually necessary in the real world as the orientation of the coordinate system itself is arbitrary. The system can become holonomic if the wheel moves only in a straight line at any fixed angle relative to a given reference. Thus, we have not only proved that the original system is nonholonomic, but we also were able to find a restriction that can be added to the system to make it holonomic.

However, there is something mathematically special about the restriction of formula_50 for the system to make it holonomic, as formula_53 in a Cartesian grid. Combining the two equations and eliminating formula_15, we indeed see that formula_55 and therefore one of those two coordinates is completely redundant. We already know that the steering angle is a constant, so that means the holonomic system here needs to only have a configuration space of formula_56. As discussed here, a system that is modellable by a Pfaffian constraint must be holonomic if the configuration space consists of two or fewer variables. By modifying our original system to restrict it to have only two degrees of freedom and thus requiring only two variables to be described, and assuming it can be described in Pfaffian form (which in this example we already know is true), we are assured that it is holonomic.

===Rolling sphere===
This example is an extension of the &#x27;rolling wheel&#x27; problem considered above.

Consider a three-dimensional orthogonal Cartesian coordinate frame, for example, a level table top with a point marked on it for the origin, and the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; axes laid out with pencil lines. Take a sphere of unit radius, for example, a ping-pong ball, and mark one point &quot;B&quot; in blue. Corresponding to this point is a diameter of the sphere, and the plane orthogonal to this diameter positioned at the center &quot;C&quot; of the sphere defines a great circle called the equator associated with point &quot;B&quot;. On this equator, select another point &quot;R&quot; and mark it in red. Position the sphere on the &quot;z&quot; = 0 plane such that the point &quot;B&quot; is coincident with the origin, &quot;C&quot; is located at &quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;y&quot; = 0, &quot;z&quot; = 1, and &quot;R&quot; is located at &quot;x&quot; = 1, &quot;y&quot; = 0, and &quot;z&quot; = 1, i.e. &quot;R&quot; extends in the direction of the positive &quot;x&quot; axis. This is the initial or reference orientation of the sphere.

The sphere may now be rolled along any continuous closed path in the &quot;z&quot; = 0 plane, not necessarily a simply connected path, in such a way that it neither slips nor twists, so that &quot;C&quot; returns to &quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;y&quot; = 0, &quot;z&quot; = 1. In general, point &quot;B&quot; is no longer coincident with the origin, and point &quot;R&quot; no longer extends along the positive &quot;x&quot; axis. In fact, by selection of a suitable path, the sphere may be re-oriented from the initial orientation to any possible orientation of the sphere with &quot;C&quot; located at &quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;y&quot; = 0, &quot;z&quot; = 1. The system is therefore nonholonomic. The anholonomy may be represented by the doubly unique quaternion (&quot;q&quot; and −&quot;q&quot;) which, when applied to the points that represent the sphere, carries points &quot;B&quot; and &quot;R&quot; to their new positions.

===Foucault pendulum===
An additional example of a nonholonomic system is the Foucault pendulum. In the local coordinate frame the pendulum is swinging in a vertical plane with a particular orientation with respect to geographic north at the outset of the path. The implicit trajectory of the system is the line of latitude on the Earth where the pendulum is located. Even though the pendulum is stationary in the Earth frame, it is moving in a frame referred to the Sun and rotating in synchrony with the Earth&#x27;s rate of revolution, so that the only apparent motion of the pendulum plane is that caused by the rotation of the Earth. This latter frame is considered to be an inertial reference frame, although it too is non-inertial in more subtle ways. The Earth frame is well known to be non-inertial, a fact made perceivable by the apparent presence of centrifugal forces and Coriolis forces.

Motion along the line of latitude is parameterized by the passage of time, and the Foucault pendulum&#x27;s plane of oscillation appears to rotate about the local vertical axis as time passes. The angle of rotation of this plane at a time &quot;t&quot; with respect to the initial orientation is the anholonomy of the system. The anholonomy induced by a complete circuit of latitude is proportional to the solid angle subtended by that circle of latitude. The path need not be constrained to latitude circles. For example, the pendulum might be mounted in an airplane. The anholonomy is still proportional to the solid angle subtended by the path, which may now be quite irregular. The Foucault pendulum is a physical example of parallel transport.

===Linear polarized light in an optical fiber===
Take a length of optical fiber, say three meters, and lay it out in an absolutely straight line. When a vertically polarized beam is introduced at one end, it emerges from the other end, still polarized in the vertical direction. Mark the top of the fiber with a stripe, corresponding with the orientation of the vertical polarization.

Now, coil the fiber tightly around a cylinder ten centimeters in diameter. The path of the fiber now describes a helix which, like the circle, has constant curvature. The helix also has the interesting property of having constant torsion. As such the result is a gradual rotation of the fiber about the fiber&#x27;s axis as the fiber&#x27;s centerline progresses along the helix. Correspondingly, the stripe also twists about the axis of the helix.

When linearly polarized light is again introduced at one end, with the orientation of the polarization aligned with the stripe, it will, in general, emerge as linear polarized light aligned not with the stripe, but at some fixed angle to the stripe, dependent upon the length of the fiber, and the pitch and radius of the helix. This system is also nonholonomic, for we can easily coil the fiber down in a second helix and align the ends, returning the light to its point of origin. The anholonomy is therefore represented by the deviation of the angle of polarization with each circuit of the fiber. By suitable adjustment of the parameters, it is clear that any possible angular state can be produced.

===Robotics===
In robotics, nonholonomic has been particularly studied in the scope of motion planning and feedback linearization for mobile robots.

<text>Action Directe () is a short overhanging sport climb at the limestone Waldkopf crag in Frankenjura, Germany. When it was first climbed by German climber Wolfgang Güllich in 1991, it became the first climb in the world to have a consensus grade. &quot;Action Directe&quot; is considered an important route in rock climbing history, and is one of the most attempted climbs at its grade, where it is considered the &quot;benchmark&quot; for the level of 9a. The plyometric training techniques and customized equipment that Güllich used to prepare for the unique physical demands of &quot;Action Directe&quot; also revolutionized climbing and what could be achieved.

== History ==

A close friend of Güllich, German climber Milan Sykora introduced him to the route that he had been working on at a large limestone prow at the Waldkopf crag, which was akin to an enormous boulder. Sykora was one of the leading German climbers at the time and had created several new routes UIAA grade X. In the 1980s, Sykora had bolted a line coming from the right and had managed to climb the individual moves through the upper section, but believed the lower section feasible but too hard for himself – he generously offered the project to Güllich, who promptly bolted the direct start, and hence the name &quot;Directe&quot;; Güllich said that it also named after the French terror group Action directe as climbing it felt like an attack on the fingers.

Güllich completed the first free ascent on 14 September 1991, after 11 days of working the route – spread over three weeks – and using a 16-move sequence including a direct start with a dynamic jump into a two-finger pocket to redpoint it. Güllich was 30 at the time and had been married just 5 days previously to freeing the route. Four years later the route was repeated when East German climber Alexander Adler fulfilled what he called an &quot;obsession&quot; to repeat the climb.

Subsequent climbers have used a slightly different circa 11 to 13-move sequence to Güllich&#x27;s original very direct 16-move sequence. At the 25-year anniversary of its first ascent, ten climbers who had completed the route assembled and estimated only Adler had repeated Güllich&#x27;s exact 16-move sequence, and that all others had crossed slightly right to use a shorter sequence.

Güllich conservatively assigned a UIAA grade of XI, which was between and . Subsequent ascents would verify its grade, which has since described as the &quot;gold standard&quot; or &quot;benchmark&quot; for ; and the first ever 9a in history. It wasn&#x27;t for almost another decade, until 2001 when Chris Sharma freed the 35-metre &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot; at Céüse in France, that a higher consensus grade would be assigned.

On 22 May 2020, French climber Mélissa Le Nevé made the first female free ascent and almost three decades after Güllich&#x27;s original ascent was still only the 27th person to have climbed it. Two of the 27 ascents, Richard Simpson (2005), and Said Belhaj (2018), are disputed.

==Route==

&quot;Action Directe&quot; is famous for its unique style, involving physically demanding dynamic moves (known as dynos in bouldering) off single-finger pockets in the limestone, and in particular, a powerful initial dynamic jump-start into a two-finger pocket while leaning back at an extreme angle of 45-degrees. The route is short at and took Güllich only 70-seconds to complete his very direct 16-move sequence; most ascents post the second ascent move rightwards to a more efficient 11 to 13 move sequence described as &quot;slightly&quot; easier than Güllich&#x27;s original sequence (although still solidly 9a).

After his 2016 ascent, German climber David Firnenburg described it as: &quot;The initial dyno into the sharp two-finger pocket is followed by a passage with extreme lock-offs on small finger pockets. Then there are technically complicated side holds and pinches with difficult foot changes before you run out with a tricky must-hit crimp at the very end, where I still fell several times before sending&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Action Directe&quot; has been consistently described as famous, legendary, and iconic in the climbing media, and even in 2020, it was being described as &quot;an absolute cornerstone of cutting-edge difficulties that attracts an irresistible draw for the vertical elite&quot;, and &quot;... milestone 9a is one of the most famous and coveted sport climbs in the world&quot;. &quot;Action Directe&quot; has also been described as &quot;Güllich&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; – the testpiece for – and when he freed the route, he was at the height of his physical and technical powers. 

Güllich had used new intensive training techniques called plyometrics to prepare for the physical demands of the climb, and introduced the climbing world to the &quot;campus board&quot;, which would become the new standard for future extreme climbers to build finger strength and develop more dynamic muscle strength.

Some have speculated whether English climber Ben Moon&#x27;s 1990 ascent of the very short &quot;Hubble&quot;, with only 4 crux moves, was actually the world&#x27;s first route. Repeat ascents of &quot;Hubble&quot; have verified it as being &quot;at least&quot; the world&#x27;s first . German climber Alex Megos, is one of the few who have climbed both &quot;Hubble&quot; and &quot;Action Directe&quot;, and felt &quot;Hubble&quot; was probably an 8c+ in the right conditions, although Megos caveated himself by noting that grading is not an exact science, and is subject to the climber&#x27;s own style. In 2022, British climber Buster Martin became only the second climber to have climbed both routes and felt that they were both 9a; he did note that being sponsored by Ben Moon might make people skeptical of his view.

The situation has been compared to the &quot;Realization&quot; versus Alexander Huber&#x27;s &quot;&quot; debate on the world&#x27;s first . In fact, Huber attributes the initial conservative grading of &quot;Action Directe&quot; that persisted for many years, despite it being eventually shown to be a &quot;hard 9a&quot;, for artificially suppressing the grades of other routes in the 1990s, such as Huber&#x27;s &quot;La Rambla&quot;, and &quot;Weisse Rose&quot;.

<text>The term collation refers to one or two light meals allowed on days of fasting, especially in Western Christianity. Its purpose is to allow a believer to perform their duties while fasting throughout the day.

== History ==
The traditional Black Fast of Western Christianity, which was broken after sunset, did not permit a collation if strictly observed. After the 14th century AD, taking a collation became a normative part of Christian fasting practices in many localities. Water was not allowed to be consumed during the collation, but only during the main meal, which was taken after sunset.

The consumption of a collation originally derives from the rule dating from the mid-6th century A.D. in Benedictine monasteries, that the usual evening meal was to be followed by the reading of excerpts from &quot;Collationes patrum in Scetica eremo&quot; written by John Cassian in around 420 A.D. However, according to the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;, on days of fasting there would be no evening meal: Vespers was directly followed by the readings from the &quot;Collationes&quot; or the &quot;Lives of the Fathers&quot;, and then Compline.

By the 9th century AD the strict rules about fasting in Western Christianity started to become more relaxed, as it became allowed to have a small amount of water in the evening on fast days. Over the centuries, this eventually grew to apply to the indulgence of &quot;a recognized quantity of solid food&quot; allowed on days of fasting, with or without abstinence. The evening collation came to be defined by the Catholic Church as being less than eight ounces of food. In the 19th century, the allowance of another collation, called a frustulum, was introduced by the Catholic Church and is permitted to be eaten in the morning.

== Present day ==
At the present time, on Christian strict fasting days of Lent (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday), the Catholic Church prescribes &quot;only one full meal a day, but does not prohibit taking some food in the morning and evening, observing — as far as quantity and quality are concerned — approved local custom.&quot;. This is, in some places, interpreted as &quot;one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal&quot;.

Similarly, a Missouri Synod Lutheran publication delineating fasting guidelines states that &quot;On fasting days, two ¼ meals are eaten, and one regular meal in the evening&quot;. The Traditional Saint Augustine&#x27;s Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion defines &quot;Fasting, usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent.&quot;

==Other uses==
The French court of Louis XIV used the term collation to refer to light meals in general. In British English today, a collation is likewise a light meal, offered to guests when there is insufficient time for fuller entertainment. It is often rendered cold collation in reference to the usual lack of hot or cooked food. The Polish word &quot;kolacja&quot; (&quot;supper&quot;) is a derivation.

In modern Italian, the two small meals are the &quot;prima colazione&quot; (breakfast) and &quot;seconda colazione&quot; (lunch). The word &quot;colazione&quot; itself in the general language now means &quot;breakfast&quot; (whereas the English &quot;break their fast&quot; for breakfast; lunch is &quot;pranzo&quot; in Italian).

<doc id="554255" wikidata="Q13383825" url="?curid=554255" title="Overalls">
<text>Overalls or bib-and-brace overalls, also called dungarees in British English, are a type of garment usually used as protective clothing when working. The garments are commonly referred to as a &quot;pair of overalls&quot; by analogy with &quot;pair of trousers&quot;.

Overalls were originally made of denim, but they can also be made of other materials such as corduroy, chino cloth, or leather. Overalls were invented in the mid to late 1890s by Grace Howard and Jacob W. Davis at Levi Strauss &amp; Co., but they went through an evolution to reach their modern form. Initially created to serve as protective clothing during physically demanding work, they have since also become a fashion garment. Many high-fashion brands have released their own spin on overalls. Today, overalls can still be found in some workplaces, while also being worn casually by all kinds of people.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
The exact beginnings of the wearing of overalls are unclear, but they are mentioned in literature as early as 1776 as protective working garments commonly worn by slaves.

The first evidence of overalls being mass-produced are those made by Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis in the 1890s. The first &quot;jeans&quot; they invented were actually &quot;waist-high overalls&quot;, consisting of denim pants with suspenders attached with buttons, but without a bib. From the beginning, denim overalls were popular workers&#x27; garments due to their durability. In fact, Levi Strauss &amp; Co.&#x27;s slogan in the 1880s-1890s was &quot;Never Rip, Never Tear&quot;.

In 1911, Harry David Lee made the first bib overalls, made of pants with pockets with a bib and straps over the shoulders.

In 1927, Lee&#x27;s developed a &quot;hook-less fastener&quot; and created &quot;button-less&quot; overalls. Zippers replaced buttons. Soon after, suspender buttons were traded in for belt loops to attach over-the-shoulder straps.

=== The Overalls Movement of 1920 ===
In 1920, groups of &quot;Overalls Clubs&quot; formed around the United States. They took overalls as their symbol to protest the rising cost of clothing, and profiteering in the garment industry.

=== The Great Depression ===

In the 1930s, the poorest segments of the American population wore overalls: farmers, miners, loggers, and railroad workers. They were most commonly worn by men and boys in the Southern and Midwestern United States. 
They can be seen in many of Walker Evans&#x27;s photographs.

===Modern history===

Bib overalls (in different colors and textiles) became popular garments among American youth from the 1960s onward.

Overalls were especially popular among hip hop artists during the 1990s.

In the 21st century, overalls have evolved into high-fashion garments. Designers such as Stella McCartney include them in ready-to-wear collections for men, women, and children. McCartney&#x27;s children&#x27;s overalls sell for as much as US$138 in the US.

== Brands ==
Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and Lee were not the only companies making overalls in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

* One of the oldest brands of overalls, OshKosh B&#x27;gosh, founded in 1895 in Wisconsin, specialized in blue-and-white &quot;hickory-stripe&quot; bib overalls. The company produced bib overalls for children in the late 1960s.

* Larned, Carter &amp; Co., from Detroit, called themselves the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Overall Makers&quot;. They marketed their products as uniforms for railroad workers.

* One of the biggest overall manufacturers was Blue Bell, which began in North Carolina in 1904. It was popular among railroad workers.

* Round House workwear of Oklahoma has produced heavy duty work overalls since 1903, and remains one of the only companies which still manufactures a fair portion of them in the United States.

* Jellico Clothing Manufacturing Co., later renamed Big Ben, was a major competitor of Blue Bell. Big Ben bought Blue Bell in 1926 and continued under the name Blue Bell. Blue Bell then bought the overalls company Casey Jones.

Other current manufacturers of overalls include:

*Carhartt

*Dickies

*Ben Davis

*Red Kap

== Garments adapted from overalls ==

Shortalls (a contraction of the words &quot;short&quot; and &quot;overalls&quot;) are with the lower part adapted into shorts.

 is the French word for bib-and-brace overalls. The word is used in English for a similar garment to overalls worn for sailing, skiing, diving, and other heavy-duty activities. They are made of wind-and-waterproof trousers, traditionally with a high waist reaching to the chest and held up by adjustable shoulder braces.

Historically, military &quot;overalls&quot; were loose garments worn in the 18th and early 19th centuries over soldiers&#x27; breeches and gaiters when on active service or in barracks. After 1823, the term was replaced by &quot;trousers&quot; in British Army documents, but it survives to the present day in reference to the tight-fitting garments strapped under the instep, worn as part of the mess dress and full dress uniforms of cavalry regiments.

<text>The Paraguayan War (, , ), also known as the War of the Triple Alliance (, , ), was a South American war that lasted from 1864 to 1870. It was fought between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance of Argentina, the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay. It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history. Paraguay sustained large casualties, but even the approximate numbers are disputed. Paraguay was forced to cede disputed territory to Argentina and Brazil. The war began in late 1864, as a result of a conflict between Paraguay and Brazil caused by the Uruguayan War. Argentina and Uruguay entered the war against Paraguay in 1865, and it then became known as the &quot;War of the Triple Alliance&quot;.

After Paraguay was defeated in conventional warfare, it conducted a drawn-out guerrilla resistance, a strategy that resulted in the further destruction of the Paraguayan military and the civilian population. Much of the civilian population died due to battle, hunger, and disease. The guerrilla war lasted for 14 months until president Francisco Solano López was killed in action by Brazilian forces in the Battle of Cerro Corá on 1 March 1870. Argentine and Brazilian troops occupied Paraguay until 1876.

==Background==
===Territorial disputes===

Since their independence from Portugal and Spain in the early 19th century, the Empire of Brazil and the Spanish-American countries of South America were troubled by territorial disputes. Each nation in this region had boundary conflicts with multiple neighbors. Most had overlapping claims to the same territories, due to unresolved questions which stemmed from their former metropoles. Signed by Portugal and Spain in 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas proved ineffective in the following centuries, as both colonial powers expanded their frontiers in South America and elsewhere. The outdated boundary lines did not represent the actual occupation of lands by the Portuguese and Spanish.

By the early 1700s, the Treaty of Tordesillas was deemed not useful, and it was clear to both parties that a newer treaty had to be drawn based on feasible boundaries. In 1750, the Treaty of Madrid separated the Portuguese and Spanish areas of South America in lines that mostly corresponded to present-day boundaries. Neither Portugal nor Spain was satisfied with the results, and new treaties were signed in the following decades that either established new territorial lines or repealed them. The final accord signed by both powers, the 1801 Treaty of Badajoz, reaffirmed the validity of the previous Treaty of San Ildefonso (1777), which had derived from the older Treaty of Madrid.

The territorial disputes became worse when the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata collapsed in the early 1810s, leading to the rise of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay. Historian Pelham Horton Box wrote: &quot;Imperial Spain bequeathed to the emancipated Spanish-American nations not only her own frontier disputes with Portuguese Brazil but problems which had not disturbed her, relating to the exact boundaries of her own viceroyalties, captaincies general, audiencias and provinces.&quot; Once separated the three countries quarreled over lands that were mostly uncharted or unknown. They were either sparsely populated or settled by indigenous tribes that answered to no parties. In the case of Paraguay and Brazil, the problem was to define whether the Apa or Branco rivers should represent their actual boundary, a persistent issue that had confused Spain and Portugal in the late 18th century. A few indigenous tribes populated the region between the two rivers, and these tribes would attack Brazilian and Paraguayan settlements that were local to them.

===Political situation before the war===

There are several theories regarding the origins of the war. The traditional view emphasizes that the policies of Paraguayan president Francisco Solano López used the Uruguayan War as a pretext to gain control of the Platine basin. That caused a response from the regional hegemons, Brazil and Argentina, both of which exercised influence over the much smaller republics of Uruguay and Paraguay. The war has also been attributed to the aftermath of colonialism in South America with border conflicts between the new states, the struggle for power among neighboring nations over the strategic Río de la Plata region, Brazilian and Argentine meddling in internal Uruguayan politics (which had already caused the Platine War), Solano López&#x27;s efforts to help his allies in Uruguay (which had been defeated by the Brazilians), and his presumed expansionist ambitions.

A strong military was developed because Paraguay&#x27;s larger neighbors, Argentina and Brazil, had territorial claims against it and wanted to dominate it politically, much as both had already done in Uruguay. Paraguay had recurring boundary disputes and tariff issues with Argentina and Brazil for many years during the rule of Solano Lopez&#x27;s predecessor and father, Carlos Antonio López.

===Regional tension===
In the time since Brazil and Argentina had become independent, their struggle for hegemony in the Río de la Plata region had profoundly marked the diplomatic and political relations among the countries of the region.

Brazil was the first country to recognize the independence of Paraguay, in 1844. At this time Argentina still considered it a breakaway province. While Argentina was ruled by Juan Manuel Rosas (1829–1852), a common enemy of both Brazil and Paraguay, Brazil contributed to the improvement of the fortifications and development of the Paraguayan army, sending officials and technical help to Asunción.

As no roads linked the inland province of Mato Grosso to Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian ships needed to travel through Paraguayan territory, going up the Paraguay River to arrive at Cuiabá. However, Brazil had difficulty obtaining permission from the government in Asunción to freely use the Paraguay River for its shipping needs.

===Uruguayan prelude===


Brazil had carried out three political and military interventions in the politically unstable Uruguay: 
* in 1851 against Manuel Oribe in order to fight Argentine influence in the country and to end the Great Siege of Montevideo; 
* in 1855, at the request of the Uruguayan government and Venancio Flores, leader of the Colorado Party, which was traditionally supported by the Brazilian Empire;
* in 1864, against Atanasio Aguirre. This last intervention would lead to the Paraguayan War.

On 19 April 1863, Uruguayan general Venancio Flores, who was then an officer in the Argentine army as well as the leader of the Colorado Party of Uruguay, invaded his country, starting the &quot;Cruzada Libertadora&quot; with the open support of Argentina, which supplied the rebels with arms, ammunition and 2,000 men. Flores wanted to overthrow the Blanco Party government of president Bernardo Berro, which was allied with Paraguay.

Paraguayan president López sent a note to the Argentine government on 6 September 1863, asking for an explanation, but Buenos Aires denied any involvement in Uruguay. From that moment, mandatory military service was introduced in Paraguay; in February 1864, an additional 64,000 men were drafted into the army.

One year after the beginning of the &quot;Cruzada Libertadora&quot;, in April 1864, Brazilian minister José Antônio Saraiva arrived in Uruguayan waters with the Imperial Fleet, to demand payment for damages caused to Rio Grande do Sul farmers in border conflicts with Uruguayan farmers. Uruguayan president Atanasio Aguirre, from the Blanco Party, rejected the Brazilian demands, presented his own demands, and asked Paraguay for help. To settle the growing crisis, Solano López offered himself as a mediator of the Uruguayan crisis, as he was a political and diplomatic ally of the Uruguayan &quot;Blancos&quot;, but the offer was turned down by Brazil.

Brazilian soldiers on the northern borders of Uruguay started to provide help to Flores&#x27; troops and harassed Uruguayan officers, while the Imperial Fleet pressed hard on Montevideo. During the months of June–August 1864 a Cooperation Treaty was signed between Brazil and Argentina at Buenos Aires, for mutual assistance in the Plate Basin Crisis.

Brazilian minister Saraiva sent an ultimatum to the Uruguayan government on 4 August 1864: either comply with the Brazilian demands, or the Brazilian army would retaliate. The Paraguayan government was informed of all this and sent to Brazil a message, which stated in part:
The Brazilian government, probably believing that the Paraguayan threat would be only diplomatic, answered on 1 September, stating that &quot;they will never abandon the duty of protecting the lives and interests of Brazilian subjects.&quot; But in its answer, two days later, the Paraguayan government insisted that &quot;if Brazil takes the measures protested against in the note of August 30th, 1864, Paraguay will be under the painful necessity of making its protest effective.&quot;

On 12 October, despite the Paraguayan notes and ultimatums, Brazilian troops under the command of general invaded Uruguay. This was not the start of the Paraguayan war, however, for Paraguay continued to maintain diplomatic relations with Brazil for another month.

On 11 November the Brazilian ship &quot;Marquês de Olinda&quot;, on her routine voyage up the River Paraguay to the Brazilian Mato Grosso, and carrying the new governor of that province, docked at Asunción and took on coal. Completing the formalities, she continued on her journey. According to one source, López hesitated whether to break the peace for a whole day, saying &quot;If we don&#x27;t have a war now with Brazil, we shall have one at a less convenient time for ourselves&quot;. López then ordered the Paraguayan ship &quot;Tacuarí&quot; to pursue her and compel her return. On 12 November &quot;Tacuarí&quot; caught up with &quot;Marquês de Olinda&quot; in the vicinity of Concepción, fired across her bows, and ordered her to return to Asunción; when she arrived on the 13th, all on board were arrested. On the 12th Paraguay informed the Brazilian minister in Asunción that diplomatic relations had been broken off.

The conflict between Brazil and Uruguay was settled in February 1865. News of the war&#x27;s end was brought by Pereira Pinto and met with joy in Rio de Janeiro. Brazilian emperor Pedro II found himself waylaid by a crowd of thousands in the streets amid acclamations. However, public opinion quickly changed for the worse when newspapers began running stories painting the convention of 20 February as harmful to Brazilian interests, for which the cabinet was blamed. The newly promoted Viscount of Tamandaré and Mena Barreto (now Baron of São Gabriel) had supported the peace accord. Tamandaré changed his mind soon afterward and played along with the allegations. A member of the opposition party, José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco, was used as a scapegoat by the emperor and the government and was recalled in disgrace to the imperial capital. The accusation that the convention had failed to meet Brazilian interests proved to be unfounded. Not only had Paranhos managed to settle all Brazilian claims, but by preventing the death of thousands, he gained a willing and grateful Uruguayan ally instead of a dubious and resentful one, which provided Brazil with an important base of operations during the acute clash with Paraguay that shortly ensued.

==Opposing forces==
===Paraguay===
According to some historians, Paraguay began the war with over 60,000 trained men—38,000 of whom were already under arms—400 cannons, a naval squadron of 23 steamboats and five river-navigating ships (among them, the gunboat &quot;Tacuarí&quot;).

Communication in the Río de la Plata basin was maintained solely by river, as very few roads existed. Whoever controlled the rivers would win the war, so Paraguay had built fortifications on the banks of the lower end of the Paraguay River.

However, recent studies suggest many problems. Although the Paraguayan army had between 70,000 and 100,000 men at the beginning of the conflict, they were badly equipped. Most infantry armaments consisted of inaccurate smooth-bore muskets and carbines, slow to reload and short-ranged. The artillery was similarly poor. Military officers had no training or experience, and there was no command system, as all decisions were made personally by López. Food, ammunition, and armaments were scarce, with logistics and hospital care deficient or nonexistent. The nation of about 450,000 people could not stand against the Triple Alliance of 11 million people.

The Paraguayan army during peacetime prior to the war was made up of eight infantry battalions of 800 men each but had only been able to muster 4,084 Infantrymen with five cavalry regiments, nominally 2,500 (2,522 in reality) and two artillery regiments, with 907 men. By March 1865, six new infantry battalions and eight cavalry regiments had been formed. In addition, the Paraguayans could rely on their militia which consisted of all able-bodied men which, as the war continued, began to include increasingly younger and older men.

===Brazil and its allies===

At the beginning of the war, the military forces of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay were far smaller than Paraguay&#x27;s. Argentina had approximately 8,500 regular troops and a naval squadron of four steamers and one schooner. Uruguay entered the war with fewer than 2,000 men and no navy. Many of Brazil&#x27;s 16,000 troops were located in its southern garrisons. The Brazilian advantage, though, was in its navy, comprising 45 ships with 239 cannons and about 4,000 well-trained crew. A great part of the squadron was already in the Rio de la Plata basin, where it had acted under the Marquis of Tamandaré in the intervention against Aguirre&#x27;s government.

Brazil, however, was unprepared to fight a war. Its army was disorganized. The troops it used in Uruguay were mostly armed contingents of gauchos and the National Guard. While some Brazilian accounts of the war described their infantry as volunteers (Voluntários da Pátria), other Argentine revisionist and Paraguayan accounts disparaged the Brazilian infantry as mainly recruited from slaves and the landless (largely black) underclass, who were promised free land for enlisting. The cavalry was formed from the National Guard of Rio Grande do Sul.

Ultimately, a total of about 146,000 Brazilians fought in the war from 1864 to 1870, consisting of the 10,025 army soldiers stationed in Uruguayan territory in 1864, 2,047 that were in the province of Mato Grosso, 55,985 Fatherland Volunteers, 60,009 National Guardsmen, 8,570 ex-slaves who had been freed to be sent to war, and 9,177 navy personnel. Another 18,000 National Guard troops stayed behind to defend Brazilian territory.

==Course of the war==
===Paraguayan offensive===
====In Mato Grosso====
Paraguay took the initiative during the first phase of the war, launching the Mato Grosso Campaign by invading the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso on 14 December 1864, followed by an invasion of the Rio Grande do Sul province in the south in early 1865 and the Argentine Corrientes Province.

Two separate Paraguayan forces invaded Mato Grosso simultaneously. An expedition of 3,248 troops, commanded by Vicente Barrios, was transported by a naval squadron under the command of frigate captain Pedro Ignacio Meza up the Paraguay River to the town of Concepción. There they attacked the New Coimbra Fort on 27 December 1864. The Brazilian garrison of 154 men resisted for three days, under the command of Hermenegildo Portocarrero (later Baron of Fort Coimbra). When their munitions were exhausted, the defenders abandoned the fort and withdrew up the river towards Corumbá on board the gunship &quot;Anhambaí&quot;. After occupying the fort, the Paraguayans advanced further north, taking the cities of Albuquerque, Tage and Corumbá in January 1865.

Solano López then sent a detachment to attack the military frontier post of Dourados. On 29 December 1864, this detachment, led by Martín Urbieta, encountered tough resistance from Antônio João Ribeiro and his 16 men, who were all eventually killed. The Paraguayans continued to Nioaque and Miranda, defeating the troops of José Dias da Silva. The city of Coxim was taken in April 1865. The second Paraguayan column, formed from some of the 4,650 men led by Francisco Isidoro Resquín at Concepción, penetrated into Mato Grosso with 1,500 troops.

Despite these victories, the Paraguayan forces did not continue to Cuiabá, the capital of the province, where Augusto Leverger had fortified the camp of Melgaço. Their main objective was the capture of the gold and diamond mines, disrupting the flow of these materials into Brazil until 1869.

Brazil sent an expedition to fight the invaders in Mato Grosso. A column of 2,780 men led by Manuel Pedro Drago left Uberaba in Minas Gerais in April 1865 and arrived at Coxim in December, after a difficult march of more than through four provinces. However, Paraguay had already abandoned Coxim by December. Drago arrived at Miranda in September 1866, and the Paraguayans had left once again. Colonel Carlos de Morais Camisão assumed command of the column in January 1867—now with only 1,680 men—and decided to invade Paraguayan territory, which he penetrated as far as Laguna where Paraguayan cavalry forced the expedition to retreat.

Despite the efforts of Camisão&#x27;s troops and the resistance in the region, which succeeded in liberating Corumbá in June 1867, a large portion of Mato Grosso remained under Paraguayan control. The Brazilians withdrew from the area in April 1868, moving their troops to the main theatre of operations, in the south of Paraguay.

====Paraguayan invasion of Corrientes and Rio Grande do Sul====
The invasion of Corrientes and Rio Grande do Sul was the second phase of the Paraguayan offensive. In order to support the Uruguayan Blancos, the Paraguayans had to travel across Argentine territory. In January 1865, Solano López asked Argentina&#x27;s permission for an army of 20,000 men (led by general Wenceslao Robles) to travel through the province of Corrientes. Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre refused Paraguay&#x27;s request and a similar one from Brazil.

After this refusal, the Paraguayan Congress gathered at an emergency meeting on 5 March 1865. After several days of discussions, on 23 March Congress decided to declare war on Argentina for its policies, hostile to Paraguay and favourable to Brazil, and then they conferred to Francisco Solano López the rank of Field Marshal of the Republic of Paraguay. The declaration of war was sent on 29 March 1865 to Buenos Aires.

On 13 April 1865, a Paraguayan squadron sailed down the Paraná River and attacked two Argentine ships in the port of Corrientes. Immediately general Robles&#x27; troops took the city with 3,000 men, and a cavalry force of 800 arrived the same day. Leaving a force of 1,500 men in the city, Robles advanced southwards along the eastern bank.

Along with Robles&#x27; troops, a force of 12,000 soldiers under colonel Antonio de la Cruz Estigarribia crossed the Argentine border south of Encarnación in May 1865, driving for Rio Grande do Sul. They traveled down the Uruguay River and took the town of São Borja on 12 June. Uruguaiana, to the south, was taken on 6 August with little resistance.

By invading Corrientes, Solano López had hoped to gain the support of the powerful Argentine &quot;caudillo&quot; Justo José de Urquiza, governor of the provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, who was known to be the chief federalist hostile to Mitre and the central government in Buenos Aires. However, Urquiza gave his full support to an Argentine offensive. The forces advanced approximately south before ultimately ending the offensive in failure.

Following the invasion of the Corrientes Province by Paraguay on 13 April 1865, a great uproar stirred in Buenos Aires as the public learned of Paraguay&#x27;s declaration of war. President Bartolomé Mitre made a famous speech to the crowds on 4 May 1865:

The same day, Argentina declared war on Paraguay; however, on 1 May 1865, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay had signed the secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance in Buenos Aires. They named Bartolomé Mitre, president of Argentina, as supreme commander of the allied forces. The signatories of the treaty were Rufino de Elizalde (Argentina), Otaviano de Almeida (Brazil) and Carlos de Castro (Uruguay).

On 11 June 1865, at the naval Battle of Riachuelo, the Brazilian fleet commanded by admiral Francisco Manoel Barroso da Silva destroyed the Paraguayan navy and prevented the Paraguayans from permanently occupying Argentine territory. For all practical purposes, this battle decided the outcome of the war in favor of the Triple Alliance; from that point onward, it controlled the waters of the Río de la Plata basin up to the entrance to Paraguay.

A separate Paraguayan division of 3,200 men that continued towards Uruguay under the command of Pedro Duarte, who was then defeated by Allied troops under Venancio Flores in the bloody Battle of Yatay, on the banks of the Uruguay River, near Paso de los Libres.
While Solano López ordered the retreat of the forces that had occupied Corrientes, the Paraguayan troops that invaded São Borja advanced, taking Itaqui and Uruguaiana. The situation in Rio Grande do Sul was chaotic, and the local Brazilian military commanders were incapable of mounting effective resistance to the Paraguayans.

The baron of Porto Alegre set out for Uruguaiana, a small town in the province&#x27;s west, where the Paraguayan army was besieged by a combined force of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units. Porto Alegre assumed command of the Brazilian army in Uruguaiana on 21 August 1865. On 18 September, the Paraguayan garrison surrendered without further bloodshed.

===Allied counterattack===
In subsequent months, the Paraguayans were driven out of the cities of Corrientes and San Cosme, the only Argentine territory still in Paraguayan possession.

By the end of 1865, the Triple Alliance was on the offensive. Its armies numbered 42,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry as they invaded Paraguay in April. The Paraguayans scored small victories against major forces in the Battle of Corrales (also known as battle of Pehuajó or Itati) in the Corrientes Province, but it could not stop the invasion.

==== Invasion of Paraguay ====
On 16 April 1866, the Allied armies invaded Paraguayan mainland by crossing the Paraná River. López launched counterattacks, but they were repelled by general Manuel Luís Osório, who took victories in the battles of Itapirú and Isla Cabrita. Yet, the Allied advance was checked in the first major battle of the war, at Estero Bellaco, on 2 May 1866.

Solano López, believing that he could deal a fatal blow to the Allies, launched a major offensive with 25,000 men against 35,000 Allied soldiers at the Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May 1866, one of the bloodiest battles in Latin-American history. Despite being very close to victory at Tuyutí, López&#x27;s plan was shattered by the Allied army&#x27;s fierce resistance and the decisive action of the Brazilian artillery. Both sides sustained heavy losses: more than 12,000 casualties for Paraguay versus 6,000 for the Allies.

By 18 July, the Paraguayans had recovered, defeating forces commanded by Mitre and Flores in the Battle of Sauce and Boquerón, losing more than 2,000 men against the Allied 6,000 casualties. However, Brazilian general Porto Alegre won the Battle of Curuzú, putting the Paraguayans in a desperate situation.

On 12 September 1866, after the defeat in the Battle of Curuzú, Solano López invited Mitre and Flores to a conference in Yataytí Corá, which resulted in a &quot;heated argument&quot; among both leaders. López had realized that the war was lost and was ready to sign a peace treaty with the Allies. However, no agreement was reached, since Mitre&#x27;s conditions for signing the treaty were that every article of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was to be carried out, a condition that Solano López refused. Article 6 of the treaty made truce or peace with López nearly impossible, as it stipulated that the war was to continue until the then government ceased to be, which meant the removal of Solano López.

====Allied setback at Curupayty: their advance comes to a halt====

After the conference, the Allies marched into Paraguayan territory, reaching the defensive line of Curupayty. Trusting their numerical superiority and the possibility of attacking the flank of the defensive line through the Paraguay River by using the Brazilian ships, the Allies made a frontal assault on the defensive line, supported by the flank fire of the battleships. However, the Paraguayans, commanded by general José E. Díaz, stood strong in their positions and set up for a defensive battle, inflicting tremendous damage on the attacking Allied troops, resulting in over 8,000 casualties on the Brazil-Argentine army against no more than 250 losses of the Paraguayans. The Battle of Curupayty resulted in an almost catastrophic defeat for the Allied forces, ending their offensive for ten months, until July 1867.

The Allied leaders blamed each other for the disastrous failure at Curupayty. General Flores left for Uruguay in September 1866 shortly after the battle and was later murdered there in 1867. Porto Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, field marshal Polidoro Jordão. General Jordão was ostracized for supporting Mitre and for being a member of the Conservative Party, while Porto Alegre and Tamandaré were Progressives.

General Porto Alegre also blamed Mitre for the tremendous defeat, saying:

Mitre had a harsh opinion of the Brazilians and said that &quot;Porto Alegre and Tamandaré, who are cousins, and cousins even in lack of judgement have made a family pact to monopolize, in practice, the command of war.&quot; He further criticized Porto Alegre: &quot;It is impossible to imagine a greater military nullity than this general, to which it can be added Tamandaré&#x27;s dominating bad influence over him and the negative spirit of both in relation to the allies, owning to passions and petty interests.&quot;

=== Siege of Humaitá ===

====Caxias assumes command====
The Brazilian government decided to create a unified command over Brazilian forces operating in Paraguay and turned to the 63-year-old Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, the Marquess of Caxias, as the new leader on 10 October 1866. Osório was sent to organize a 5,000-strong third corps of the Brazilian army in Rio Grande do Sul. Caxias arrived in Itapiru on 17 November. His first measure was to dismiss vice-admiral Tamandaré. The government had appointed Caxias&#x27; fellow Conservative vice-admiral Joaquim José Inácio—later the Viscount of Inhaúma—to lead the navy.

The Marquess of Caxias assumed command on 19 November. He aimed to end the never-ending squabbling among the allied commanders and to increase his autonomy from the Brazilian government. With the departure of president Mitre in February 1867, Caxias assumed overall command of the Allied forces. He found the army practically paralyzed and devastated by disease. During this period Caxias trained his soldiers, re-equipped the army with new guns, improved the quality of the officer corps, and upgraded the health corps and overall hygiene of the troops, putting an end to epidemics. From October 1866 until July 1867, all offensive operations were suspended. Military operations were limited to skirmishes with the Paraguayans and bombarding Curupayty. Solano López took advantage of the disorganization of the enemy to reinforce the Fortress of Humaitá.

====The advance resumes: fall of Humaitá====

As the Brazilian army was ready for combat, Caxias sought to encircle Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the war effort, Caxias used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. With the 3rd Corps ready for combat, the Allied army started its flanking march around Humaitá on 22 July. The march to outflank the left-wing of the Paraguayan fortifications constituted the basis of Caxias&#x27; tactics. He wanted to bypass the Paraguayan strongholds, cut the connections between Asunción and Humaitá and finally encircle the Paraguayans. The 2nd Corps was stationed in Tuyutí, while the 1st corps and the newly created 3rd Corps were used by Caxias to encircle Humaitá. President Mitre returned from Argentina and re-assumed overall command on 1 August. With the capture on 2 November by Brazilian troops of the Paraguayan position of Tahí, at the shores of the river, Humaitá would become isolated from the rest of the country by land.

The combined Brazilian, Argentine, and Uruguayan army continued advancing north through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. The Allied force advanced to San Solano on the 29th and Tayi on 2 November, isolating Humaitá from Asunción. Before dawn on 3 November, Solano López reacted by ordering the attack on the rearguard of the allies in the Second Battle of Tuyutí.

The Paraguayans, commanded by general Bernardino Caballero breached the Argentine lines, causing enormous damage to the Allied camp and successfully capturing weapons and supplies, very needed by López for the war effort. Only thanks to the intervention of Porto Alegre and his troops, the Allied army recovered. During the Second Battle of Tuyutí, Porto Alegre fought with his saber in hand-to-hand combat and lost two horses. In this battle, the Paraguayans lost over 2,500 men, while the allies had just over 500 casualties.

By 1867, Paraguay had lost 60,000 men to battle casualties, injuries, or disease. Due to the growing manpower shortage, López conscripted another 60,000 soldiers from slaves and children. Women were entrusted with all support functions alongside the soldiers. Many Paraguayan soldiers went into battle without shoes or uniforms. López enforced the strictest discipline, executing even his two brothers and two brothers-in-law for alleged defeatism.

By December 1867, there were 45,791 Brazilians, 6,000 Argentines and 500 Uruguayans at the front. After the death of Argentine vice president Marcos Paz, Mitre relinquished his position for the second and final time on 14 January 1868. Allied representatives in Buenos Aires abolished the position of Allied commander-in-chief on 3 October, although the Marquess of Caxias continued to fill the role of Brazilian supreme commander.

On 19 February, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control of the river and isolating Humaitá from resupply by water. Humaitá fell on 25 July 1868, after a long siege.

López with the bulk of his army escaped from the siege of Humaitá. Before doing so he tried a daring manoeuvre: to capture one or more allied ironclads by human wave boarding tactics.
The assault on the warships &quot;Lima Barros&quot; and &quot;Cabral&quot; was a naval action that took place in the early hours of 2 March 1868, when Paraguayan canoes, joined two by two, disguised with branches and manned by 50 soldiers each, approached the ironclads &quot;Lima Barros&quot; and &quot;Cabral&quot;. The Imperial Fleet, which had already achieved the Passage of Humaitá, was anchored in the Paraguay river, before the Taji stronghold near Humaitá.

Taking advantage of the dense darkness of the night and the hyacinths that descended on the current, a squadron of canoes covered by branches and foliage and tied two by two, crewed by 1,500 Paraguayans armed with machetes, hatchets and approaching swords, went to approach &quot;Cabral&quot; and &quot;Lima Barros&quot;. The fighting continued until dawn when the warships &quot;Brasil&quot;, &quot;Herval&quot;, &quot;Mariz e Barros&quot; and &quot;Silvado&quot; approached and shot the Paraguayans, who gave up the attack, losing 400 men and 14 canoes.

=== Fall of Asunción ===
&quot;En route&quot; to Asunción, the Allied army went north to Palmas, stopping at the Piquissiri River. There Solano López had concentrated 12,000 Paraguayans in a fortified line that exploited the terrain and supported the forts of Angostura and Itá-Ibaté.

Resigned to frontal combat, Caxias ordered the so-called Piquissiri maneuver. While a squadron attacked Angostura, Caxias made the army cross to the west side of the river. He ordered the construction of a road in the swamps of the Gran Chaco along which the troops advanced to the northeast. At Villeta the army crossed the river again, between Asunción and Piquissiri, behind the fortified Paraguayan line.Instead of advancing to the capital, already evacuated and bombarded, Caxias went south and attacked the Paraguayans from the rear in December 1868, in an offensive which became known as &quot;Dezembrada&quot;. Caxias&#x27; troops were ambushed while crossing the Ytororó during an initial advance, during which the Paraguayans inflicted severe damage on the Brazilian armies. Days later, however, the Allies destroyed a whole Paraguayan division at the Battle of Avay. Weeks later, Caxias won another decisive victory at the Battle of Lomas Valentinas and captured the last stronghold of the Paraguayan Army in Angostura. On 24 December, Caxias sent a note to Solano López asking for surrender, but Solano López refused and fled to Cerro León. Alongside the Paraguayan president was the American Minister-Ambassador, Martin T. McMahon, who after the war became a fierce defender of López&#x27;s cause.
Asunción was occupied on 1 January 1869, by Brazilian general João de Souza da Fonseca Costa, father of the future marshal Hermes da Fonseca. On 5 January, Caxias entered the city with the rest of the army. Most of Caxias army settled in Asunción, where also 4,000 Argentine and 200 Uruguayan troops soon arrived together with about 800 soldiers and officers of the Paraguayan Legion. By this time, Caxias was ill and tired. On 17 January, he fainted during a mass; he relinquished his command the next day, and the day after that left for Montevideo.

Very soon the city hosted about 30,000 Allied soldiers; for the next few months these looted almost every building, including diplomatic missions of European nations.

====Provisional government====

With Solano López on the run, the country lacked a government. Pedro II sent his foreign minister José Paranhos to Asunción where he arrived on 20 February 1869 and began consultations with the local politicians. Paranhos had to create a provisional government that could sign a peace accord and recognize the border claimed by Brazil between the two nations. According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Paranhos, &quot;the then-greatest Brazilian specialist on Platine affairs&quot;, had a &quot;decisive&quot; role in the installation of the Paraguayan provisional government.

With Paraguay devastated, the power vacuum resulting from Solano López&#x27;s overthrow was quickly filled by emerging domestic factions which Paranhos had to accommodate. On 31 March, a petition was signed by 335 leading citizens asking Allies for a Provisional government. This was followed by negotiations between the Allied countries, which put aside some of the more controversial points of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance; on 11 June, agreement was reached with Paraguayan opposition figures that a three-man Provisional government would be established. On 22 July, a National Assembly met in the National Theatre and elected &quot;Junta Nacional&quot; of 21 men which then selected a five-man committee to select three men for the Provisional government. They selected Carlos Loizaga, Juan Francisco Decoud, and José Díaz de Bedoya. Decoud, being pro-Argentine, was unacceptable to Paranhos, who had him replaced with Cirilo Antonio Rivarola. The government was finally installed on 15 August but was just a front for the continued Allied occupation. After the death of Lopez, the Provisional Government issued a proclamation on 6 March 1870 in which it promised to support political liberties, to protect commerce and to promote immigration. Loizaga and Bedoya were politically active members of the Paraguayan community in exile, both without any experience in public administration. Loizaga, specifically, was an old man who loved poetry and adventure stories and was tired and anxious to retire from public life. Bedoya was different, his brother was executed by Marshal Lopez for being a conspirator, and akin to his sibling he lacked education and was greedy. Later Bedoya made a trip to Buenos Aires and absconded with church silver from Paraguay (which had been given to him to serve as guarantee for a loan), and then disappeared from public life. Rivarola was described as being devoted to the law but with arbitrary and despotic tendencies, both good and evil, possessing truth and falsehood, and a lack of character. All three men were lackeys of the Empire of Brazil. Though there were other men more capable and available for the job, none had any chance of success without the patronage of the Allies.

The Provisional Government did not last. Bedoya disappeared in May 1870; on 31 August 1870, Carlos Loizaga resigned. The remaining member, Cirilo Rivarola, was then immediately relieved of his duties by the National Assembly, which established a provisional Presidency, to which it elected Facundo Machaín, who assumed his post that same day. However, the next day, 1 September, he was overthrown in a &quot;coup&quot; that restored Rivarola to power, backed by Brazilian forces.

===Guerilla warfare===
==== Campaign of the Hills ====
The son-in-law of Emperor Pedro II, Gaston, Count of Eu, was nominated in 1869 to direct the final phase of the military operations in Paraguay. At the head of 21,000 men, Eu led the campaign against the Paraguayan resistance, the Campaign of the Hills, which lasted over a year.

Most important were the Battle of Piribebuy and the Battle of Acosta Ñu, in which more than 5,000 Paraguayans died. After a successful beginning which included victories over the remnants of Solano López&#x27;s army, the Count fell into depression and Paranhos became the unacknowledged, de facto commander-in-chief.

====Death of Solano López====

President Solano López organized the resistance in the mountain range northeast of Asunción. At the end of the war, with Paraguay suffering severe shortages of weapons and supplies, Solano López reacted with draconian attempts to keep order, ordering troops to kill any of their colleagues, including officers, who talked of surrender. Paranoia prevailed in the army, and soldiers fought to the bitter end in a resistance movement, resulting in more destruction in the country.

Two detachments were sent in pursuit of Solano López, who was accompanied by 200 men in the forests in the north. On 1 March 1870, the troops of General José Antônio Correia da Câmara surprised the last Paraguayan camp in Cerro Corá. During the ensuing battle, Solano López was wounded and separated from the remainder of his army. Too weak to walk, he was escorted by his aide and a pair of officers, who led him to the banks of the Aquidaban-nigui River. The officers left Solano López and his aide there while they looked for reinforcements.

Before they returned, Câmara arrived with a small number of soldiers. Though he offered to permit Solano López to surrender and guaranteed his life, Solano López refused. Shouting &quot;I die with my homeland!&quot;, he tried to attack Câmara with his sword. He was quickly killed by Câmara&#x27;s men, bringing an end to the long conflict in 1870.

===List of battles===
==Casualties of the war==

Paraguay suffered massive casualties, and the war&#x27;s disruption and disease also cost civilian lives. Some historians estimate that the nation lost the majority of its population. The specific numbers are hotly disputed and range widely. A survey of 14 estimates of Paraguay&#x27;s pre-war population varied between 300,000 and 1,337,000. Later academic work based on demographics produced a wide range of estimates, from a possible low of 21,000 (7% of population) (Reber, 1988) to as high as 69% of the total prewar population (Whigham, Potthast, 1999). Because of the local situation, all casualty figures are a very rough estimate; accurate casualty numbers may never be determined.

After the war, an 1871 census recorded 221,079 inhabitants, of which 106,254 were women, 28,746 were men, and 86,079 were children (with no indication of sex or upper age limit).

The worst reports are that up to 90% of the male population was killed, though this figure is without support. One estimate places total Paraguayan losses—through both war and disease—as high as 1.2 million people, or 90% of its pre-war population, but modern scholarship has shown that this number depends on a population census of 1857 that was a government invention. A different estimate places Paraguayan deaths at approximately 300,000 people out of 500,000 to 525,000 pre-war inhabitants. During the war, many men and boys fled to the countryside and forests.

In the estimation of Vera Blinn Reber, however, &quot;The evidence demonstrates that the Paraguayan population casualties due to the war have been enormously exaggerated&quot;.
A 1999 study by Thomas Whigham from the University of Georgia and Barbara Potthast (published in the &quot;Latin American Research Review&quot; under the title &quot;The Paraguayan Rosetta Stone: New Evidence on the Demographics of the Paraguayan War, 1864–1870&quot;, and later expanded in the 2002 essay titled &quot;Refining the Numbers: A Response to Reber and Kleinpenning&quot;) used a methodology to yield more accurate figures. To establish the population before the war, Whigham used an 1846 census and calculated, based on a population growth rate of 1.7% to 2.5% annually (which was the standard rate at that time), that the immediately pre-war Paraguayan population in 1864 was approximately 420,000–450,000. Based on a census carried out after the war ended, in 1870–1871, Whigham concluded that 150,000–160,000 Paraguayan people had survived, of whom only 28,000 were adult males. In total, 60–70% of the population died as a result of the war, leaving a woman/man ratio of 4 to 1 (as high as 20 to 1, in the most devastated areas). For academic criticism of the Whigham-Potthast methodology and estimates see the main article Paraguayan War casualties.
Steven Pinker wrote that, assuming a death rate of over 60% of the Paraguayan population, this war was proportionally one of the most destructive in modern times for any nation state.

===Allied losses===
As was common before antibiotics were developed, disease caused more deaths than war wounds. Bad food and poor sanitation contributed to disease among troops and civilians. Among the Brazilians, two-thirds of the dead died either in a hospital or on the march. At the beginning of the conflict, most Brazilian soldiers came from the north and northeast regions; the change from a hot to a colder climate, combined with restricted food rations, may have weakened their resistance. Entire battalions of Brazilians were recorded as dying after drinking water from rivers. Therefore, some historians believe cholera, transmitted in the water, was a leading cause of death during the war.

==Gender and ethnic aspects==
===Women in the Paraguayan War===

Paraguayan women played a significant role in the Paraguayan War. During the period just before the war began many Paraguayan women were the heads of their households, meaning they held a position of power and authority. They received such positions by being widows, having children out of wedlock, or their husbands having worked as &quot;peons&quot;. When the war began women started to venture out of the home, becoming nurses, working with government officials, and establishing themselves into the public sphere. When &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the war in 1868, it considered Paraguayan women equal to their male counterparts.

The support of the Paraguayan women to the war effort can be divided into two stages. The first is from the time the war began in 1864 to the Paraguayan evacuation of Asunción in late 1868. During this period of the war, peasant women became practically the sole producers of agricultural goods. From the conflict&#x27;s outbreak, women also served the military in an auxiliary capacity. In addition to being nurses in military hospitals (which became increasingly valuable during the war&#x27;s later stages during cholera outbreaks), those from the countryside would accompany Paraguayan army divisions in separate groups. These attachments were composed of volunteers who by extension were unpaid and not provided rations for (they had to share the food and supplies the enlisted men were provided). Regardless, they served supportive duties such as wagoning supplies, tending to casualties, digging trenches, maintaining discipline and order at camps, and acting as messengers to Asunción by reporting on the latest frontline happenings. Following the Paraguayan navy&#x27;s defeat by Brazil&#x27;s in June 1865, effectively depriving the country of any overseas trade, the Paraguayan government ordered and organized women to harvest and weave textiles, including standardized military uniforms, miscellaneous clothing, and cots for military hospitals. 

The second stage began when the war turned into an irregular conflict; it started when the capital of Paraguay fell and ended with the death of Paraguay&#x27;s president Francisco Solano López in 1870. At this stage, women increasingly became casualties of war. The Paraguayan government press, with doubtful veracity, claimed that battalions of women were formed to fight the Allies and exalted the role of Ramona Martínez (who was a woman enslaved by López) as &quot;the American Joan of Arc&quot; for her fighting and rallying of injured troops. Assessing Paraguayan women&#x27;s contributions to the war accurately is difficult due to their not acting as regulars in Paraguay&#x27;s armed forces exacerbating lacking historical records from the conflict&#x27;s closing years. Most probably (as had been the case in the prior stage of the war) the role of women was a non-combative, supportive one.

A 2012 piece in &quot;The Economist&quot; argued that with the death of most of Paraguay&#x27;s male population, the Paraguayan War distorted the sex ratio to women greatly outnumbering men and has impacted the sexual culture of Paraguay to this day. Because of the depopulation, men were encouraged after the war to have multiple children with multiple women, even supposedly celibate Catholic priests. A columnist linked this cultural idea to the paternity scandal of former president Fernando Lugo, who fathered multiple children while he was a supposedly celibate priest.

===Paraguayan indigenous people===
Prior to the war, indigenous people occupied very little space in the minds of the Paraguayan elite. Paraguayan president Carlos Antonio Lopez even modified the country&#x27;s constitution in 1844 to remove any mention of Paraguay&#x27;s Hispano-Guarani character. This marginalization was undercut by the fact that Paraguay had long prized its military as its only honorable and national institution and the majority of the Paraguayan military was indigenous and spoke Guarani. However, during the war, the indigenous people of Paraguay came to occupy an even larger role in public life, especially after the Battle of Estero Bellaco. For this battle, Paraguay put its &quot;best&quot; men, who happened to be of Spanish descent, front and center. Paraguay overwhelmingly lost this battle, as well as &quot;the males of all the best families in the country.&quot; The now remaining members of the military were &quot;old men who had been left in Humaita, Indians, slaves and boys.&quot;

The war also bonded the indigenous people of Paraguay to the project of Paraguayan nation-building. In the immediate lead up to the war, they were confronted with a barrage of nationalist rhetoric (in Spanish and Guarani) and subject to loyalty oaths and exercises. Paraguayan president Francisco Solano Lopez, son of Carlos Antonio Lopez, was well aware that the Guarani speaking people of Paraguay had a group identity independent of the Spanish-speaking Paraguayan elite. He knew he would have to bridge this divide or risk it being exploited by the &#x27;Triple Alliance.&#x27; To a certain extent, Lopez succeeded in getting the indigenous people to expand their communal identity to include all of Paraguay. As a result of this, any attack on Paraguay was considered to be an attack on the Paraguayan nation, despite rhetoric from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina saying otherwise. This sentiment increased after the terms of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance were leaked, especially the clause stating that Paraguay would pay for all the damages incurred by the conflict.

===Afro-Brazilians===

The Brazilian government allowed the creation of black-only units or &quot;zuavos&quot; in the military at the outset of the war, following the proposal of Afro-Brazilian Quirino Antônio do Espírito Santo, a veteran of the Brazilian War of Independence. Over the course of the war, the &quot;zuavos&quot; became an increasingly attractive option for many enslaved Afro-Brazilian men, especially given the z&quot;uavos&quot;’ negative opinion toward slavery. Once the &quot;zuavos&quot; had enlisted or forcibly recruited them, it became difficult for their masters to regain possession of them, since the government was desperate for soldiers. By 1867, black-only units were no longer permitted, with the entire military being integrated just as it had been prior to the war. The overarching rationale behind this was that the &quot;country needed recruits for its existing battalions, not more independently organized companies.&quot; This did not mean the end of black soldiers in the Brazilian military. On the contrary, &quot;impoverished &quot;gente de cor&quot; constituted the greater part of the soldiery in every Brazilian infantry battalion.&quot;

Afro-Brazilian women played a key role in sustaining the Brazilian military as &quot;&quot;vivandeiras&quot;.&quot; &quot;Vivandeiras&quot; were poor women who traveled with the soldiers to undertake &quot;logistic tasks such as carrying tents, preparing food and doing laundry.&quot; For most of these women, the principal reason they became vivandeiras was because their male loved ones had joined as soldiers, and they wanted to take care of them. However, the Brazilian government actively worked to minimize the importance of their work by labeling it &quot;service to their male kin, not the nation&quot; and considering it to be &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;habitual.&quot; The reality was that the government depended heavily on these women and officially required their presence in the camps. Poor Afro-Brazilian women also served as nurses, with most of them being trained upon entry into the military to assist male doctors in the camps. These women were &quot;seeking gainful employment to compensate for the loss of income from male kin who had been drafted into the war.&quot;

==Territorial changes and treaties==

Paraguay permanently lost its claim to territories which, before the war, were in dispute between it and Brazil or Argentina, respectively. In total, about were affected. Those disputes had been longstanding and complex.

===Disputes with Brazil===
In colonial times certain lands lying to the north of the River Apa were in dispute between the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire. After independence they continued to be disputed between the Empire of Brazil and the Republic of Paraguay.

After the war Brazil signed a separate Loizaga–Cotegipe Treaty of peace and borders with Paraguay on 9 January 1872, in which it obtained freedom of navigation on the Paraguay River. Brazil also retained the northern regions it had claimed before the war. Those regions are now part of its State of Mato Grosso do Sul.

===Disputes with Argentina===

====Misiones====
In colonial times the missionary Jesuits established numerous villages in lands between the rivers Paraná and Uruguay. After the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish territory in 1767, the ecclesiastical authorities of both Asunción and Buenos Aires made claim to religious jurisdiction in these lands and the Spanish government sometimes awarded it to one side, sometimes to the other; sometimes they split the difference.

After independence, the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine Confederation succeeded to these disputes. On 19 July 1852, the governments of the Argentine Confederation and Paraguay signed a treaty, by which Paraguay relinquished its claim to the Misiones. However, this treaty did not become binding, because it required to be ratified by the Argentine Congress, which refused. Paraguay&#x27;s claim was still alive on the eve of the war. After the war the disputed lands definitively became the Argentine national territory of Misiones, now Misiones Province.

====Gran Chaco====
The Gran Chaco is an area lying to the west of the River Paraguay. Before the war it was &quot;an enormous plain covered by swamps, chaparral and thorn forests ... home to many groups of feared Indians, including the Guaicurú, Toba and Mocoví.&quot; There had long been overlapping claims to all or parts of this area by the Argentine Confederation, Bolivia and Paraguay. With some exceptions, these were paper claims, because none of those countries was in effective occupation of the area: essentially, they were claims to be the true successor to the Spanish Empire, in an area never effectively occupied by Spain itself, and wherein Spain had no particular motive for prescribing internal boundaries.

The exceptions were as follows. First, to defend itself against Indian incursions, both in colonial times and after, the authorities in Asunción had established some border forts on the west bank of the river Paraguay—a coastal strip within the Chaco. By the same treaty of 19 July 1852, between Paraguay and the Argentine Confederation, an undefined area in the Chaco north of the Bermejo River was implicitly conceded to belong to Paraguay. As already stated, the Argentine Congress refused to ratify this treaty; and it was protested by the government of Bolivia as inimical to its own claims. The second exception was that in 1854, the government of Carlos Antonio López established a colony of French immigrants on the right bank of the River Paraguay at Nueva Burdeos; when it failed, it was renamed Villa Occidental.

After 1852, and more especially after the State of Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation, Argentina&#x27;s claim to the Chaco hardened; it claimed territory all the way up to the border with Bolivia. By Article XVI of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance Argentina was to receive this territory in full. However, the Brazilian government disliked what its representative in Buenos Aires had negotiated in this respect and resolved that Argentina should not receive &quot;a handsbreadth of territory&quot; above the Pilcomayo River. It set out to frustrate Argentina&#x27;s further claim, with eventual success.

The post-war border between Paraguay and Argentina was resolved through long negotiations, completed 3 February 1876, by signing the Machaín-Irigoyen Treaty. This treaty granted Argentina roughly one third of the area it had originally desired. Argentina became the strongest of the River Plate countries. When the two parties could not reach consensus on the fate of the &quot;Chaco Boreal&quot; area between the Río Verde and the main branch of Río Pilcomayo, the President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes, was asked to arbitrate. His award was in Paraguay&#x27;s favor. The Paraguayan Presidente Hayes Department is named in his honor.

==Consequences of the war==
===Paraguay===

There was a destruction of the pre-war state structure, a definitive loss of claimed frontier territories, and the ruination of the Paraguayan economy, so that even decades later, it could not develop in the same way as its neighbors. Paraguay is estimated to have lost up to 69% of its population, most of them due to illness, hunger and physical exhaustion, of which 90% were male according to the most extreme reports, and also maintained a high debt of war with the allied countries that, not completely paid, ended up being pardoned in 1943 by the Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas. A new pro-Brazil government was installed in Asunción in 1869, while Paraguay remained occupied by Brazilian and Argentine forces until 1876, when the border treaty between Paraguay and Argentina was concluded with American arbitration, guaranteeing Paraguay&#x27;s sovereignty and leaving it a buffer state between its larger neighbors.

===Brazil===
The War helped the Brazilian Empire to reach its peak of political and military influence, becoming the &quot;Great Power&quot; of South America, and also helped to bring about the end of slavery in Brazil, moving the military into a key role in the public sphere. However, the war caused a ruinous increase of public debt, which took decades to pay off, severely limiting the country&#x27;s growth. The war debt, alongside a long-lasting social crisis after the conflict, are regarded as crucial factors for the fall of the Empire and proclamation of the First Brazilian Republic.

During the war the Brazilian army took complete control of Paraguayan territory and occupied the country for six years after 1870. In part this was to prevent the annexation of even more territory by Argentina, which had wanted to seize the entire Chaco region. During this time, Brazil and Argentina had strong tensions, with the threat of armed conflict between them.

During the wartime sacking of Asunción, Brazilian soldiers carried off war trophies. Among the spoils taken was a large caliber gun called &quot;Cristiano&quot;, named because it was cast from church bells of Asunción melted down for the war.

In Brazil the war exposed the fragility of the Empire and dissociated the monarchy from the army. The Brazilian army became a new and influential force in national life. It developed as a strong national institution that, with the war, gained tradition and internal cohesion. The Army would take a significant role in the later development of the history of the country. The economic depression and the strengthening of the army later played a large role in the deposition of the emperor Pedro II and the republican proclamation in 1889. Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca became the first Brazilian president.

As in other countries, &quot;wartime recruitment of slaves in the Americas rarely implied a complete rejection of slavery and usually acknowledged masters&#x27; rights over their property.&quot; Brazil compensated owners who freed slaves for the purpose of fighting in the war, on the condition that the freedmen immediately enlist. It also impressed slaves from owners when needing manpower, and paid compensation. In areas near the conflict, slaves took advantage of wartime conditions to escape, and some fugitive slaves volunteered for the army. Together these effects undermined the institution of slavery. But the military also upheld owners&#x27; property rights, as it returned at least 36 fugitive slaves to owners who could satisfy its requirement for legal proof. Significantly, slavery was not officially ended until the 1880s.

Brazil spent close to 614,000 &quot;réis&quot; (the Brazilian currency at the time), which were gained from the following sources:
Due to the war, Brazil ran a deficit between 1870 and 1880, which was finally paid off. At the time foreign loans were not significant sources of funds.

===Argentina===
Following the war, Argentina faced many federalist revolts against the national government. Economically it benefited from having sold supplies to the Brazilian army, but the war overall decreased the national treasure. The national action contributed to the consolidation of the centralized government after revolutions were put down, and the growth in influence of Army leadership.

It has been argued the conflict played a key role in the consolidation of Argentina as a nation-state. That country became one of the wealthiest in the world, by the early 20th century. It was the last time that Brazil and Argentina openly took such an interventionist role in Uruguay&#x27;s internal politics.

By the account of historian Mateo Martinic the war put a temporary hold on Argentine plans to challenge the Chilean occupation of the Strait of Magellan.

===Uruguay===
Uruguay suffered lesser effects, although nearly 5,000 soldiers were killed. As a consequence of the war, the Colorados gained political control of Uruguay and, despite rebellions, retained it until 1958.

==Modern interpretations of the war==

Interpretation of the causes of the war and its aftermath has been a controversial topic in the histories of participating countries, especially in Paraguay. There it has been considered either a fearless struggle for the rights of a smaller nation against the aggression of more powerful neighbors, or a foolish attempt to fight an unwinnable war that almost destroyed the nation.

Several revisionist historians consider the mass extermination of the Paraguayan people during the war to be a case of genocide. In 2022, the Mercosur Parliament formed the Sub-Commission for Truth and Justice on the War of the Triple Alliance, within its Human Rights Commission, to investigate the potential crimes (including genocide) committed during the war and then arrive at a &quot;consensual truth&quot; on the matter within the parliament.

In December 1975, after presidents Ernesto Geisel of Brazil and Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay signed a treaty of friendship and co-operation in Asunción, the Brazilian government returned some of its spoils of war to Paraguay but has kept others. In April 2013 Paraguay renewed demands for the return of the &quot;Christian&quot; cannon. Brazil has had this on display at the former military garrison, now used as the National History Museum, and says that it is part of its history as well.

===Theories about British influence on the outbreak of war===

A popular belief among Paraguayans and Argentine revisionists since the 1960s contends that the outbreak of war was due to the machinations of the British government, a theory which historians have noted has little to no basis in historical evidence. In Brazil, some have claimed that the United Kingdom was the primary source of financing for the Triple Alliance during the war, with British aid being given in order to advance Britain&#x27;s economic interests in the region; something which historians have noted that has little evidence to support it as well; noting that from 1863 to 1865 Brazil and Great Britain were engaged in a diplomatic incident, and five months after the outbreak of the Paraguayan war the two countries temporarily broke off relations. They have also noted that in 1864, a British diplomat wrote a letter to Solano López asking him to avoid initiating hostilities in the region, and there remains no evidence that Britain &quot;forced&quot; the allies to attack Paraguay.

Some left-wing historians of the 1960s and 1970s (most notably Eric Hobsbawm in his work &quot;The Age of Capital: 1848–1875&quot;) claimed that the Paraguayan War broke out as a result of British influence on the continent, claiming that as Britain needed a new source of cotton during the American Civil War (as the blockaded American South had been their main cotton supplier before the war). Right wing and even far-right wing historians, especially from Argentina and Paraguay, have also claimed that British influence was a major reason for the outbreak of war. Noteworthy is the fact that both the Great Soviet Encyclopedia and the Great Russian Encyclopedia, considered as official sources of the USSR and the Russian Federation respectively, also claim that the British Empire had much to do for sustaining the war effort and finances of the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; against Paraguay.

A document which has been used to support this claim is a letter from Edward Thornton (Minister of Great Britain in the Plate Basin) to British Prime Minister Lord John Russell, which contained the following statement:
Charles Washburn, who was the Minister of the United States to Paraguay and Argentina, claimed that Thornton spoke of Paraguay, months before the outbreak of the conflict, as:
However, historian E.N. Tate noted that:
Other historians have also disputed the claims of British influence in the outbreak of war, pointing out that there is no documented evidence for it. They note that, although the British economy and commercial interests benefited from the war, the British government opposed it from the start. In addition, they also noted that the war damaged international commerce (including Britain&#x27;s), and the British government disapproved of the secret clauses in the Treaty of the Triple Alliance. Britain at the time already was increasing their imports of Egyptian and Indian cotton and as such did not need any from Paraguay.

William Doria (the British Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Paraguay who briefly acted in Thornton&#x27;s place), joined French and Italian diplomats in condemning Argentina&#x27;s President Bartolomé Mitre&#x27;s involvement in Uruguay. But when Thornton returned to the job in December 1863, Doria threw his full backing behind Mitre.

==Effects on yerba mate industry==

Since colonial times, yerba mate had been a major cash crop for Paraguay. Until the war, it had generated significant revenues for the country. The war caused a sharp drop in harvesting of yerba mate in Paraguay, reportedly by as much as 95% between 1865 and 1867. Soldiers from all sides used yerba mate to diminish hunger pangs and alleviate combat anxiety.

Much of the lost by Paraguay to Argentina and Brazil was rich in yerba mate, so by the end of the 19th century, Brazil became the leading producer of the crop. Foreign entrepreneurs entered the Paraguayan market and took control of its remaining yerba mate production and industry.

<text>Bindusara (320 BCE – 273 BCE) () was the second Mauryan emperor of Magadha in Ancient India. The ancient Greco-Roman writers called him Amitrochates, a name likely derived from his Sanskrit title Amitraghāta (&quot;slayer of enemies&quot;).

Bindusara was the son of the dynasty&#x27;s founder Chandragupta and the father of its most famous ruler Ashoka. His life is not documented as well as the lives of these two emperors. Much of the information about him comes from legendary accounts written several hundred years after his death. Bindusara consolidated the empire created by his father.

The 16th century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha credits his administration with extensive territorial conquests in southern India, but some historians doubt the historical authenticity of this claim.

== Background ==

Ancient and medieval sources have not documented Bindusara&#x27;s life in detail. Much of the information about him comes from Jain legends focused on Chandragupta and the Buddhist legends focused on Ashoka. The Jain legends, such as Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot; were written more than a thousand years after his death. Most of the Buddhist legends about Ashoka&#x27;s early life also appear to have been composed by Buddhist writers who lived several hundred years after Ashoka&#x27;s death, and are of little historical value. While these legends can be used to make several inferences about Bindusara&#x27;s reign, they are not entirely reliable because of the close association between Ashoka and Buddhism.

Buddhist sources that provide information about Bindusara include &quot;Divyavadana&quot; (including &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; and &quot;Pamsupradanavadana&quot;), &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, &quot;Vamsatthappakasini&quot; (also known as &quot;Mahvamsa Tika&quot; or &quot;Mahavamsa commentary&quot;), &quot;Samantapasadika&quot;, and the 16th century writings of Taranatha. The Jain sources include the 12th century &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot; by Hemachandra and the 19th century &quot;Rajavali-Katha&quot; by Devachandra. The Hindu Puranas also mention Bindusara in their genealogies of Mauryan rulers. Some Greek sources also mention him by the name &quot;Amitrochates&quot; or its variations.

== Early life ==

=== Parents ===
Bindusara was born to Chandragupta, the founder of the Mauryan Empire. This is attested by several sources, including the various Puranas and the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;. The &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, on the other hand, names Bindusara as the son of the king Shushunaga. The prose version of &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; states that Bindusara was the son of Nanda and a 10th-generation descendant of Bimbisara. Like &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, it omits Chandragupta&#x27;s name altogether. The metrical version of &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; contains a similar genealogy with some variations.

Chandragupta had a marriage alliance with the Seleucids, which has led to speculation that Bindusara&#x27;s mother might have been Greek or Macedonian. However, there is no evidence of this. According to the 12th century Jain writer Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot;, the name of Bindusara&#x27;s mother was Durdhara.

=== Names ===
The name &quot;Bindusara&quot;, with slight variations, is attested by the Buddhist texts such as &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; and &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; (&quot;Bindusaro&quot;); the Jain texts such as &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot;; as well as the Hindu texts such as &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; (&quot;Vindusara&quot;). Other Puranas give different names for Chandragupta&#x27;s successor; these appear to be clerical errors. For example, the various recensions of &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; mention him as Varisara or Varikara. The different versions of &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; call him Bhadrasara or Nandasara.

The &quot;Mahabhashya&quot; names Chandragupta&#x27;s successor as &quot;Amitra-ghāta&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;slayer of enemies&quot;). The Greek writers Strabo and Athenaeus call him Allitrochades (Ἀλλιτροχάδης) and Amitrochates (Ἀμιτροχάτης) respectively; these names are probably derived from the Sanskrit title. J.F. Fleet believed that the Greek name was derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Amitrakhāda&quot; (&quot;devourer of enemies&quot;), a title of Indra.

In addition, Bindusara was given the title &quot;Devanampriya&quot; (&quot;The Beloved of the Gods&quot;), which was also applied to his successor Ashoka. The Jain work &quot;Rajavali-Katha&quot; states that his birth name was Simhasena.

Both Buddhist and Jain texts mention a legend about how Bindusara got his name. Both accounts state that Chandragupta&#x27;s minister Chanakya used to mix small doses of poison in the emperor&#x27;s food to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts. One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife. According to the Buddhist legends (&quot;Mahavamsa&quot; and &quot;Mahavamsa Tikka&quot;), the empress was seven days away from delivery at this time. Chanakya arrived just as the empress ate the poisoned morsel. Realizing that she was going to die, he decided to save the unborn child. He cut off the empress&#x27;s head and cut open her belly with a sword to take out the foetus. Over the next seven days, he placed the foetus in the belly of a goat freshly killed each day. After seven days, Chandragupta&#x27;s son was &quot;born&quot;. He was named Bindusara, because his body was spotted with drops (&quot;&quot;bindu&quot;) of goat&#x27;s blood. The Jain text &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot; names the empress as Durdhara, and states that Chanakya entered the room the very moment she collapsed. To save the child, he cut open the dead empress&#x27;s womb and took the baby out. By this time, a drop (&quot;bindu&quot;&quot;) of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head. Therefore, Chanakya named him Bindusara, meaning &quot;the strength of the drop&quot;.

=== Family ===

The prose version of &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; names three sons of Bindusara: Sushima, Ashoka and Vigatashoka. The mother of Ashoka and Vigatashoka was a woman named Subhadrangi, the daughter of a Brahmin of the Champa city. When she was born, an astrologer named Pingalwatsa predicted that one of her sons would be an emperor, and the other a religious man. When she grew up, her father took her to Bindusara&#x27;s palace in Pataliputra. Bindusara&#x27;s wives, jealous of her beauty, trained her as the imperial barber. Once, when the Emperor was pleased with her hairdressing skills, she expressed her desire to be a queen. Bindusara was initially apprehensive about her low class, but made her the chief empress after learning about her Brahmin descent. The couple had two sons: Ashoka and Vigatashoka. Bindusara did not like Ashoka because his &quot;limbs were hard to the touch&quot;.

Another legend in &quot;Divyavadana&quot; names Ashoka&#x27;s mother as Janapadakalyani. According to the &quot;Vamsatthappakasini&quot; (&quot;Mahavamsa Tika&quot;), the name of Ashoka&#x27;s mother was Dhamma. The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; states that Bindusara had 101 sons from 16 women. The eldest of these was Sumana / Sushima, and the youngest was Tishya (or Tissa). Ashoka and Tishya were born to the same mother.

== Reign ==

Historian Upinder Singh estimates that Bindusara ascended the throne around 297 BCE.

=== Territorial conquests ===
The 16th century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha states that Chanakya, one of Bindusara&#x27;s &quot;great lords&quot;, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made him master of all the territory between the western and the eastern seas (Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal). According to some historians, this implies conquest of Deccan by Bindusara, while others believe that this only refers to suppression of revolts.

Sailendra Nath Sen notes that the Mauryan empire already extended from the western sea (beside Saurashtra) to the eastern sea (beside Bengal) during Chandragupta&#x27;s reign. Besides, Ashoka&#x27;s inscriptions found in southern India do not mention anything about Bindusara&#x27;s conquest of Deccan (southern India). Based on this, Sen concludes that Bindusara did not extend the Mauryan empire, but managed to retain the territories he inherited from Chandragupta.

K. Krishna Reddy, on the other hand, argues that Ashoka&#x27;s inscriptions would have boasted about his conquest of southern India, had he captured Deccan. Reddy, therefore, believes that the Mauryan empire extended up to Mysore during Bindusara&#x27;s reign. According to him, the southernmost kingdoms were not a part of the Mauryan empire, but probably acknowledged its suzerainty.

Alain Daniélou believes that Bindusara inherited an empire that included the Deccan region, and made no territorial additions to the empire. Daniélou, however, believes that Bindusara brought the southern territories of the Cheras, the Cholas and the Satyaputras under nominal Mauryan control, although he could not overcome their armies. His theory is based on the fact that the ancient Tamil literature alludes to &quot;Vamba Moriyar&quot; (Mauryan conquest), although it does not provide any details about the Mauryan expeditions. According to Daniélou, Bindusara&#x27;s main achievement was organization and consolidation of the empire he inherited from Chandragupta.

=== Takshashila revolt ===

The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; suggests that Bindusara appointed his son Ashoka as the Viceroy of Ujjayini. &quot;Ashokavadana&quot; states that Bindusara sent Ashoka to lay siege to Takshashila. The Emperor refused to provide any weapons or chariots for Ashoka&#x27;s expedition. The devatas (deities) then miraculously brought him soldiers and weapons. When his army reached Takshashila, the residents of the city approached him. They told him that they only opposed Bindusara&#x27;s oppressive ministers; they had no problem with the Emperor or the prince. Ashoka then entered the city without opposition, and the devatas declared that he would rule the entire earth one day. Shortly before Bindusara&#x27;s death, there was a second revolt in Takshashila. This time, Sushima was sent to quell the rebellion, but he failed in the task.

=== Advisors ===

The &quot;Rajavali-Katha&quot; states that Chandragupta&#x27;s chief advisor (or chief minister) Chanakya accompanied him to the forest for retirement, after handing over the administration to Bindusara. However, the &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot; states that Chanakya continued to be Bindusara&#x27;s prime minister. It mentions a legend about Chanakya&#x27;s death: Chanakya asked the emperor to appoint a man named Subandhu as one of his ministers. However, Subandhu wanted to become a higher minister and grew jealous of Chanakya. So, he told Bindusara that Chanakya had cut open the belly of his mother. After confirming the story with the nurses, Bindusara started hating Chanakya. As a result, Chanakya, who was already a very old man by this time, retired and decided to starve himself to death. Meanwhile, Bindusara learned of the detailed circumstances of his birth, and implored Chanakya to resume his ministerial duties. When Chanakya refused to oblige, the Emperor ordered Subandhu to pacify him. Subandhu, while pretending to appease Chanakya, and burned him to death. Shortly after this, Subandhu himself had to retire and become a monk due to Chanakya&#x27;s curse.

&quot;Ashokavadana&quot; suggests that Bindusara had 500 imperial councillors. It names two officials – Khallataka and Radhagupta – who helped his son Ashoka became the emperor after his death.

==Foreign relations==

Bindusara maintained friendly diplomatic relations with the Greeks. Deimachos of Plateia was the ambassador of Seleucid king Antiochus I at Bindusara&#x27;s court. Deimachos seems to have written a treatise entitled &quot;On Piety&quot; (&quot;Peri Eusebeias&quot;). The 3rd century Greek writer Athenaeus, in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, mentions an incident that he learned from Hegesander&#x27;s writings: Bindusara requested Antiochus to send him sweet wine, dried figs and a sophist. Antiochus replied that he would send the wine and the figs, but the Greek laws forbade him to sell a sophist. Bindusara&#x27;s request for a sophist probably reflects his intention to learn about the Greek philosophy.

Diodorus states that the king of Palibothra (Pataliputra, the Mauryan capital) welcomed a Greek author, Iambulus. This king is usually identified as Bindusara. Pliny states that the Ptolemaic king Philadelphus sent an envoy named Dionysius to India. According to Sailendra Nath Sen, this appears to have happened during Bindusara&#x27;s reign.

== Religion ==

The Buddhist texts &quot;Samantapasadika&quot; and &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; suggest that Bindusara followed Brahmanism, calling him a &quot;Brahmana bhatto&quot; (&quot;votary of the Brahmanas&quot;). Jain sources are silent on Bindusara&#x27;s faith. A fragmentary inscription at Sanchi, in the ruins of the 3rd century BCE Temple 40, perhaps refers to Bindusara, which might suggest his connection with the Buddhist order at Sanchi.

Some Buddhist texts mention that an Ajivika astrologer or priest at Bindusara&#x27;s court prophesied the future greatness of the prince Ashoka. The &quot;Pamsupradanavadana&quot; (part of &quot;Divyavadana&quot;) names this man as Pingalavatsa. The &quot;Vamsatthappakasini&quot; (the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; commentary) names this man as Janasana, based on a commentary on &quot;Majjhima Nikaya&quot;.

The &quot;Divyavadana&quot; version states that Pingalavatsa was an Ajivika &quot;parivrajaka&quot; (wandering teacher). Bindusara asked him to assess the ability of the princes to be the next emperor, as the two watched the princes play. Pingalavatsa recognized Ashoka as the most suitable prince, but did not give a definitive answer to the Emperor, since Ashoka was not Bindusara&#x27;s favourite son. He, however, told Empress Subhadrangi of Ashoka&#x27;s future greatness. The empress requested him to leave the empire before the Emperor forced him to provide an answer. Pingalavatsa returned to the court after Bindusara&#x27;s death.

The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; commentary states that Janasana (also Jarasona or Jarasana) was the Empress&#x27;s &quot;kulupaga&quot; (ascetic of the imperial household). He had been born as a python during the period of Kassapa Buddha, and had become very wise after listening to the discussions of the bhikkhus. Based on his observations of the empress&#x27;s pregnancy, he prophesied Ashoka&#x27;s future greatness. He appears to have left the court for unknown reasons. When Ashoka grew up, the empresd told him that Janasana had forecast his greatness. Ashoka then sent a carriage to bring back Janasana, who was residing at an unnamed place far from the capital, Pataliputra. On the way back to Pataliputra, he was converted to Buddhism by one Assagutta. Based on these legends, scholars such as A. L. Basham conclude that Bindusara patronized the Ajivikas.

== Death and succession ==

Historical evidence suggests that Bindusara died in the 270s BCE. According to Upinder Singh, Bindusara died around 273 BCE. Alain Daniélou believes that he died around 274 BCE. Sailendra Nath Sen believes that he died around 273-272 BCE, and that his death was followed by a four-year struggle of succession, after which his son Ashoka became the emperor in 269-268 BCE.

According to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, Bindusara reigned for 28 years, while according to the Puranas, he ruled for 25 years. The Buddhist text &quot;Manjushri-Mula-Kalpa&quot; claims that he ruled for 70 years, which is not historically accurate.

All sources agree that Bindusara was succeeded by his son Ashoka, although they provide varying descriptions of the circumstances of this succession. According to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, Ashoka had been appointed as the viceroy of Ujjain. On hearing about his father&#x27;s fatal illness, he rushed to the capital, Pataliputra. There, he killed his 99 brothers (leaving only Tishya), and became the new emperor.

According to the prose version of &quot;Ashokavadana&quot;, Bindusara&#x27;s favourite son Sushima once playfully threw his gauntlet at the prime minister, Khallataka. The minister thought that Sushima was unworthy of being an emperor. Therefore, he approached the 500 imperial councillors, and suggested appointing Ashoka as the emperor after Bindusara&#x27;s death, pointing out that the devatas had predicted his rise as the universal ruler. Sometime later, Bindusara fell sick and decided to hand over the administration to his successor. He asked his ministers to appoint Sushima as the emperor, and Ashoka as the governor of Takshashila. However, by this time, Sushima had been sent to Takshashila, where he was unsuccessfully trying to quell a rebellion. When the Emperor was on his deathbed, the ministers suggested appointing Ashoka as the temporary emperor, and re-appointing Sushima as the emperor after his return from Takshashila. However, Bindusara became angry when he heard this suggestion. Ashoka then declared that if he was meant to be Bindusara&#x27;s successor, the devatas would appoint him as the emperor. The devatas then miraculously placed the imperial crown on his head, while Bindusara died. When Sushima heard this news, he advanced towards Pataliputra to claim the throne. However, he died after being tricked into a pit of burning charcoal by Ashoka&#x27;s well-wisher Radhagupta.

On the contrary, the Brahmanda Purana mentions that Bindusara himself crowned Ashoka as the king. 
Devachandra&#x27;s &quot;Rajavali-Katha&quot; (19th century) states that Bindusara retired after handing over the throne to Ashoka.

<text>The Estonian War of Independence, also known as the Estonian Liberation War, was a defensive campaign of the Estonian Army and its allies, most notably the United Kingdom, against the Soviet Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919 and the 1919 aggression of the pro–German &quot;Baltische Landeswehr&quot;. The campaign was the struggle of the newly established democratic state of Estonia for independence in the aftermath of World War I. It resulted in a victory for Estonia and was concluded in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.

==Preface==
During the 1917 Russian Revolution, the newly elected provincial legislature (State diet or &quot;Maapäev&quot;) of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia proclaimed itself the highest sovereign authority in Estonia, instead of the new Bolshevik government of Russia. As a result, the local Bolsheviks soon dissolved the &quot;Maapäev&quot; and temporarily forced the democratically elected Estonian leadership underground in the capital Tallinn. A few months later, in February 1918, using the interval between the Red Army&#x27;s retreat and the arrival of the Imperial German Army, the Salvation Committee formed by &quot;Maapäev&quot; issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence in Tallinn on 24 February 1918 and formed the Estonian Provisional Government. This first period of independence was extremely short-lived, as the German troops entered Tallinn the following day. The German authorities recognized neither the provisional government nor its claim for the independence of Estonia.

After the German Revolution with the capitulation of Imperial Germany at the end of World War I, 11–14 November 1918, the representatives of Germany formally handed over political power to the Estonian Provisional Government. On 16 November 1918, the provisional government called for voluntary mobilization and began to organize the Estonian armed forces, with Konstantin Päts as Minister of War, major general Andres Larka as the chief of staff, and major general Aleksander Tõnisson as commander of the Estonian army, initially consisting of one division.

==Course of the war==
===Soviet westward offensive===

In late November 1918, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian armed forces moved against Estonia. On 28 November 1918, the Soviet 6th Red Rifle Division attacked the border town of Narva, marking the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence.

The Soviet 6th Red Rifle Division attacked with 7,000 infantry, 22 field guns, 111 machine guns, an armored train, two armored vehicles, two airplanes, and the Bogatyr class cruiser &quot;Oleg&quot; supported by two destroyers. The city was defended by men of the Estonian Defence League (Home Guard) (consisting partly of secondary school students) and Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 405 of the German Army. The Reds captured Narva on 29 November and the Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 405 withdrew westwards.

The Soviet 2nd Novgorod Division opened a second front south of Lake Peipus, with 7,000 infantry, 12 field guns, 50 machine guns, two armored trains, and three armored vehicles.

Estonian military forces at the time consisted of 2,000 men with light weapons and about 14,500 poorly armed men in the Estonian Defence League. The end of November 1918 saw the formation of the Baltic Battalion, primarily a mounted machine-gun company plus infantry. Estonia&#x27;s Baltic German minority provided a sizable troop of volunteer militia for the Battalion, which was one of the first fighting units of the Estonian Army, and maintained staunch loyalty to the authority of the Republic.

The 49th Red Latvian Riflemen Regiment took the Valga railway junction on 18 December and the city of Tartu on Christmas Eve. Also on Christmas Eve, the 6th Red Rifle Division captured the Tapa railway junction, advancing to within 34 kilometers of the nation&#x27;s capital Tallinn. Estonian Bolsheviks declared the Estonian Workers&#x27; Commune in Narva.

By the end of the year, the 7th Red Army controlled Estonia along the front line 34 kilometers east of Tallinn, west from Tartu and south of Ainaži.
Colonel Johan Laidoner was appointed Commander in chief of the Estonian armed forces. He recruited 600 officers and 11,000 volunteers by 23 December 1918.
He reorganized the forces by setting up the 2nd Division in Southern Estonia under the command of Colonel Viktor Puskar, along with commando units, such as the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion and the Kalevi Malev Battalion.

The national government obtained foreign assistance. On 5 December, Finland delivered 5,000 rifles and 20 field guns along with ammunition.

A British Royal Navy squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Sir Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair arrived at Tallinn on 31 December and delivered 6,500 rifles, 200 machine guns, and two field guns. The squadron captured two Russian destroyers, &quot;Spartak&quot; and &quot;Avtroil&quot;, and turned them over to Estonia, which renamed them &quot;Vambola&quot; and &quot;Lennuk&quot;.

On 2 January, Finnish volunteer units with 2,000 men arrived in Estonia. Three armored trains were built in Tallinn under the command of sea captain Johan Pitka and Captain Karl Parts.

===Liberation of Estonian territory===
By the beginning of 1919, the Estonian Army had increased its ranks to a total of 13,000 men, with 5,700 on the front facing 8,000 Soviets. The strengthened Estonian Army stopped the 7th Red Army&#x27;s advance in its tracks between 2 and 5 January 1919 and went on the counter-offensive on 7 January.

Tapa was liberated two days later in a campaign highlighted by the implementation of the highly successful &quot;soomusrongid&quot; (armoured trains). This turn of events was swiftly followed by the liberation of the sizable town of Rakvere on 12 January.

In liberating Narva, a 1,000-strong Finnish-Estonian force landed at Utria to the rear of the Soviet 6th Rifle Division on 17 January. In so doing, retreat eastward for the Soviet forces was precluded. The following day Narva was liberated.

Consequent to this the northeastern front stabilized along the Narva river. Within 11 days, the 1st Division had advanced 200 km.

In the southern sphere-of-conflict, Tartu was liberated through the rapid deployment of armored trains and the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion. The 2nd Division continued to advance southwards facing increasing Soviet resistance. In the Battle of Paju, the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion and the Finnish volunteers drove the Red Latvian Riflemen out of Valga on 31 January.
The 7th Red Army was routed outside the boundaries of contemporary Estonia and the battle-front continued outwards into the ancient, historical Estonian settlement area. The second half of February saw the Estonian southward advance capture Salacgrīva and Alūksne. This advance was soon stopped by a Soviet buildup ostensibly for a new expansionist offensive into Estonia. On the first Independence Day of 24 February 1919, the pro-independence Estonian forces on the front consisted of 19,000 men, 70 field guns, and 230 machine guns. Estonia had become the first country to repel the Soviet westward offensive.

In the second half of February, the Red armies started the new Soviet offensive to capture Estonia. To this end, the Soviets established what was referred to as the new &#x27;Estonian&#x27; Red Army. This sizable force consisted upwards of 80,000 conscripts.

In positions along the Narva River the Estonian 1st Division and their allied White Russian Northern Corps repelled the 7th Red Army&#x27;s attacks. The Red Army heavily bombarded Narva, leaving about 2,000 people homeless yet ultimately failed to capture the city. The majority of Soviet forces were concentrated at and along the southern front. The so-called &#x27;Estonian&#x27; Red Army captured Alūksne, Setomaa, Vastseliina, and Räpina parishes by 15 March.

Having received reinforcements, the Estonian 2nd Division counterattacked and regained Petseri by 29 March. Subsequently, the &#x27;Estonian&#x27; Red Army was pushed behind the Optjok River.

On 27 March, the Estonian 3rd Division was deployed along the western flank of the southern front under the command of Major-General Ernst Põdder. At Võru, the situation became critical on 22 April when the Red Army approached to within 1.5 km of the town. Heavy fighting continued at the southeastern front up to the first half of May.

On 25 April, the Red Latvian Riflemen captured Rūjiena, but were soon pushed back by the 3rd Division to Salacgrīva-Seda-Gauja line.

===Estonian elections and formation of foreign units===

On 5–7 April 1919 the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected. The elections were won by the Left and Centre parties. The 120 members of the Constituent Assembly met at the opening session on 23 April and elected Social Democrat August Rei as chairman. The provisional government retired, and a new government headed by Otto Strandman was formed. On 4 June the assembly adopted a temporary Constitution of Estonia. On 10 October the Land Reform Act was passed, which confiscated and redistributed the large Baltic German estates that covered more than half of the territory of Estonia.

Estonia actively helped to organize White Russian, Latvian and Ingrian forces on the territory of the Republic. The White Russian Northern Corps had been organizing in Estonia since December 1918. On 18 February, an agreement was signed between Estonia and Latvia, which allowed formation of Latvian forces under Estonian command but using them only on the southern front. The North Latvian Brigade under the command of Jorģis Zemitāns was formed from the citizens of Latvia who had fled to Estonia. In March 1919, an agreement was signed with the Ingrian National People&#x27;s Committee for the formation of an Ingrian battalion. By May 1919, there were 6,000 Russians, 4,000 Latvians and 700 Ingrians in their respective national units.

===Offensives into Russia and Latvia===

Although the Estonian Army had attained control over its country, the opposing Red armies were still active. The Estonian High Command decided to push their defense lines across the border into Russia in support of the White Russian Northern Corps. On 13 May, the Northern Corps went on the offensive at Narva, catching the Soviets by surprise and destroying their 6th Division. The offensive was supported along the Gulf of Finland&#x27;s coast by the British and Estonian navy and marines. With the front approaching, the garrison of the Krasnaya Gorka fort mutinied. But the 7th Red Army received reinforcements and counterattacked, pushing the White Russians back, until the front was stabilised with the support from the Estonian 1st Division on the Luga and Saba rivers.

The offensive of the Estonian Petseri Battle Group began on 24 May. The 600 troops of 1st Estonian Rifle Regiment of the Red Army together with Leonhard Ritt, commander of the 1st Estonian Rifle Division switched sides on the same day. An offensive destroyed the Estonian Red Army, captured Pskov on 25 May and cleared the territory between Estonia and the Velikaya River of Soviet forces. A few days later White Russian forces arrived in Pskov, but as they were unable to defend the town on their own, some Estonian forces remained in Pskov, while the rest were pulled back to the state border. The Northern Corps mobilised members of the local population in the Pskov region. On 19 June 1919, the Estonian Commander-in-Chief General Johan Laidoner rescinded his command over the White Russians, and they were renamed the Northwestern Army. Shortly afterwards, General Nikolai N. Yudenich took command of the troops.
Simultaneously with the Pskov offensive Estonian 2nd and 3rd divisions also started southward offensive into Northern-Latvia. By the end of May they had captured Alūksne and Valmiera. Due to simultaneous German-Latvian offensives in Western-Latvia, the situation was becoming very difficult for the Soviets. On 31 May, an Estonian cavalry regiment led by Gustav Jonson reached Gulbene, capturing large amount of rolling stock, including 2 armoured trains. a rapid offensive of the 2nd Division, spearheaded by its cavalry regiment, continued and on 6 June it crossed Daugava river and captured Jēkabpils, but the 3rd Division could not support the advance of the 2nd division anymore as it was now facing a new enemy: the &quot;Baltische Landeswehr&quot;.

===War against the Landeswehr===
The war against the Baltische Landeswehr broke out on the southern front in Latvia on 5 June 1919. The Latvian democrats led by Kārlis Ulmanis had declared independence as in Estonia but were soon pushed back to Liepāja by Soviet forces, where the German VI Reserve Corps finally stopped their advance. This German force, led by general Rüdiger von der Goltz, consisted of the Baltische Landeswehr formed from Baltic Germans, the Guards Reserve Division of former Imperial German Army soldiers who had stayed in Latvia, and the Freikorps Iron Division of volunteers motivated by prospects of acquiring properties in the Baltics. This was possible because the terms of their armistice with the Western Allies obliged the Germans to maintain their armies in the East to counter the Bolshevist threat. The VI Reserve Corps also included the 1st Independent Latvian Battalion led by Oskars Kalpaks, which consisted of ethnic Latvians loyal to the Provisional Government of Latvia.

The Germans disrupted the organization of Latvian national forces, and on 16 April 1919 the Provisional Government was toppled and replaced with the pro-German puppet Provisional Government of Latvia led by Andrievs Niedra. Ulmanis took refuge aboard the steamship &quot;Saratow&quot; under Entente protection. The VI Reserve Corps pushed the Soviets back, capturing Riga on 23 May, continued to advance northwards, and demanded that the Estonian Army ended its occupation of parts of northern Latvia. The real intent of the VI Reserve Corps was to annex Estonia into a German-dominated puppet state.
On 3 June, Estonian General Laidoner issued an ultimatum demanding that German forces must pull back southwards, leaving the broad gauge railway between Ieriķi and Gulbene under Estonian control. When Estonian armoured trains moved out on 5 June to check compliance with this demand, the Baltische Landeswehr attacked them, unsuccessfully. The following day, the Baltische Landeswehr captured Cēsis. On 8 June, an Estonian counterattack was repelled. The first clashes demonstrated that the VI Reserve Corps was stronger and better equipped than the Soviets. On 10 June, with Entente mediation, a ceasefire was made. Despite the Entente demand for the German force to pull behind the line demanded by the Estonians, von der Goltz refused and demanded Estonian withdrawal from Latvia, threatening to continue fighting. On 19 June, fighting resumed with an assault of the Iron Division on positions of the Estonian 3rd Division near Limbaži and Straupe, starting the Battle of Cēsis. At that time, the 3rd Estonian Division, including the 2nd Latvian Cēsis regiment under Colonel Krišjānis Berķis, had 5990 infantry and 125 cavalry. Intensive German attacks on Estonian positions continued up to 22 June, without achieving a breakthrough. On 23 June, the Estonian 3rd Division counterattacked, recapturing Cēsis. The anniversary of the Battle of Cēsis (&quot;Võnnu lahing&quot; in Estonian) is celebrated in Estonia as the Victory Day.

The Estonian 3rd Division continued their advance towards Riga. On 3 July, when the Estonian forces were at the outskirts of Riga, a ceasefire was made on the demand of the Entente and the Ulmanis government was restored in Riga. The German forces were ordered to leave Latvia, the Baltische Landeswehr was put under the command of the Latvian Provisional Government and sent to fight against the Red Army. However, to circumvent Entente&#x27;s orders, the troops of the disbanded VI Reserve Corps, instead of leaving, were incorporated into the West Russian Volunteer Army, officially hired by the German puppet Government of Latvia and led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. In October, fighting restarted when the West Russian Volunteer Army attacked Riga. Following the Latvian request to help, Estonia sent two armoured trains to aid repelling the German attack. The Estonian army also remained to support the defence of Latvia against Soviets by defending the front north of Lake Lubāns.

===Final battles and peace negotiations===
Soviet Russia had been attempting to conclude a peace since the spring of 1919. On 25 April 1919, Hungarian Communists offered to mediate a settlement between the Bolsheviks and the Estonians, but Admiral Cowan threatened withdrawal of support to the Estonians unless they rejected the Hungarian offer. The Russians then publicly broached the subject of peace talks in a radio broadcast on 27 and 28 April. On 5 June the Estonian Commune was abolished. A subsequent broadcast by the Russians on 21 July led to the British journalist Arthur Ransome sounding out the Commissar for Foreign Relations Georgy Chicherin on the subject of peace talks. As a result, the Soviet government made a formal offer for negotiations on 31 August 1919. The Estonians accepted on 4 September, and delegations started talks on 16 September. Estonia then proposed to stop the negotiations until Latvia, Lithuania and Finland have agreed to participate in joint negotiations.

In the autumn, the Northwestern Army launched operation White Sword, a major effort to capture Petrograd. With the arms provided by Britain and France, and the operational support by the Estonian Army, Estonian Navy, and Royal Navy, the Northwestern Army began the offensive on 28 September 1919. Estonia supported the Northwestern Army due to the demands of the Entente. The Estonian forces made joint naval and land attacks against the Krasnaya Gorka fort, while the Estonian 2nd Division attempted to destroy bridges over the Velikaya River and the Estonian 3rd Division attacked towards Pytalovo. The Northwestern Army approached to 16 kilometres (10 miles) from Petrograd, but the Red Army repulsed the White Russian troops back to the Narva River. Distrustful of the White Russians, the Estonian High Command disarmed and interned the remains of the Northwestern Army that retreated behind the state border.
The 7th and 15th Soviet Armies advancing behind collapsing White Russian forces continued to attack the fortified positions at the state border near Narva. The first clashes took place on Luga River on 16 November, starting the conclusive battles with 120,000 Soviets facing 40,000 Estonians. After repeated attacks, the 7th Red Army managed to achieve some limited success. At the end of November, the situation on the front calmed, as the Soviets needed to replenish their forces. In order to pressure Estonia in the peace talks, intensive Soviet attacks restarted on 7 December. On 16 December, the situation became critical as forward units of the 15th Red Army crossed the Narva River. The next day, an Estonian counterattack pushed the Soviets back. The Estonian high command actively reinforced the 1st Division at Narva during the battles, sending in the headquarters of the 3rd Division. General Tõnisson became commander of the Viru Front. After suffering 35,000 casualties in heavy battles, the Red Army was completely exhausted by the end of December.

On 19 November, the new government of Jaan Tõnisson decided to restart talks with Soviet Russia, even without the participation of other Baltic countries. Negotiations began on 5 December, with the main point of dispute being territorial issues. Talks continued through December, with both sides pressing their territorial demands, while heavy fighting continued at Narva. The peace treaty was finally concluded on 31 December 1919, and the ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1920.

==Foreign assistance==

Foreign assistance, mostly from the United Kingdom and Finland, played a very important role during the early stages of war.

British naval and air forces arrived in December 1918, after lobbying in London by Estonian politicians. At this time, the new Estonian government was weak and desperate, and the Estonian Prime Minister even asked that his state be declared a British protectorate, but Britain would not meet this plea. However, the British squadron delivered 6500 rifles, 200 machine guns, and two field guns. In addition, two Soviet destroyers were captured near Tallinn and turned over to Estonia. A Royal Navy squadron continued to provide artillery support on the coast and also protected the Estonian flank against the Russian Baltic Fleet. The United Kingdom remained Estonia&#x27;s main supplier of arms and equipment throughout the war.

While the British navy provided considerable support, the historian William Fletcher concludes that &quot;the British naval force would have had little effect on the outcome of Baltic affairs had not the Estonians and Latvians provided a vibrant and disciplined land and sea force&quot;. The British contributed 88 ships to the Baltic campaign, of which 16 were sunk. 128 British servicemen died in the campaign, nine were captured, and at least 27 were wounded.
Concerned with having Bolshevik rule in the South, Finland delivered funds and weapons. Finland provided 5000 rifles and 20 field guns by 12 December. Finland also sent 3500 volunteers. Pohjan Pojat led by Hans Kalm fought at the Southern Front, including at the Battle of Paju, while I Suomalainen Vapaajoukko led by Martin Ekström fought at the Viru Front, including at the Battle of Utria. Finnish volunteers returned to Finland on March–April 1919, having lost 150 men.

The Danish-Baltic Auxiliary Corps with approximately 200 men was formed under the command of Captain Richard Gustav Borgelin in April 1919. The company took part in battles against Bolsheviks in Latvia and near Pskov and 19 men were killed by the time their contract ended in September. R. G. Borgelin was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given Maidla manor in gratitude for his services.

The Swedish volunteer unit under the command of Carl Mothander was formed in Sweden in early 1919. In March 1919, 178 volunteers took part in scout missions in Virumaa. In April, the company was sent to the Southern front and took part of the battles near Pechory. In May, the company was disbanded with some volunteers joining other units and the rest returning to Sweden.

==Tartu Peace Treaty==
On 2 February 1920, the Peace Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and RSFSR. At this point, the Bolshevist regime had not been recognized by any Western power. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The agreed frontier corresponded roughly with the position of the front line at the cessation of hostilities. In particular, Estonia retained a strategic strip to the east of the Narva river and Setumaa in the southeast.

<text>Zdravko Čolić (, ; born 30 May 1951) is a Bosnian-Serbian pop singer and widely considered one of the greatest vocalists and cultural icons of the former Yugoslavia. Favourably compared to Paul McCartney and Tom Jones by music critics and the general public, he has garnered fame in Southeastern Europe for his emotionally expressive tenor voice, fluent stage presence and numerous critically and commercially acclaimed albums and singles.

Among his songs, &quot;Ti si mi u krvi&quot; (from the eponymous album) is widely considered one of the most popular ballads of ex-Yugoslav music.

==Early life==
Born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia to Bosnian Serb parents, police administrator Vladimir Čolić from the Vlahovići village near Ljubinje (Herzegovina) and homemaker Stana Čolić from Trebinje (East Herzegovina), Čolić grew up with a younger brother Dragan. Showing an early interest in sports, the youngster was active as a football goalkeeper in FK Željezničar&#x27;s youth system, before switching to track and field where he also excelled in the 100 metres and long jump. At one point he ran a 100-meter dash in 11.3 seconds, and continually placed high at various events he entered (finishing just behind future star Nenad Stekić at one of them). Čolić eventually gave up on a career in sports, feeling he lacked the discipline required to compete regularly.

Growing up in Sarajevo, Čolić attended the Vladimir Perić Valter elementary school in the neighborhood near the adjacent neighborhood of Grbavica where he lived. He also attended music school, studying guitar playing. As a hobby, he took part in various school recitals and also acted in a couple of plays at the Pionirsko pozorište (youth theatre).

==Early career==
===Early years===
From a very young age, Čolić showed an interest in music. With friend Braco Isović, he played guitar at informal and impromptu park gatherings around their neighborhood through which they became known locally as &#x27;Čola i Isa sa Grbavice&#x27;. At the time, Čolić was trying to emulate pop schlager music that dominated Yugoslav and Italian festivals. His first love was Milena Mijatović from Belgrade.

His first significant public singing experience occurred in 1967 while at the Montenegrin coast for the Yugoslav Republic Day celebrations. Staying in the wooden prefab vacation home his family owned in the coastal community of Baošići, seventeen-year-old Čolić was persuaded by a friend, Nedim Idrizović, to enter an amateur singing competition in nearby Bijela. The teenager won second prize singing &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; by The Beatles.

Encouraged by the unexpected success, soon after returning to Sarajevo, Čolić entered his first band—a group called &#x27;Mladi i lijepi&#x27;. This participation lasted until he graduated high school in 1969 when he decided to move on to the more established Ambasadori, a band whose two incarnations Čolić would end up staying with for the next two and a half years.

===Ambasadori===
When Čolić joined them, Ambasadori employed an unusual setup: being essentially a military cover band as all the musicians, except for bandleader Slobodan Vujović, were Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) ranked officers. Their repertoire centered around the 1960s rhythm &amp; blues (Chicago, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, etc.) along with obligatory Yugoslav hits of the day and years past, and finally even a few original numbers written by the bandmembers thrown into the mix. Over time, the group started getting more gig offers, which presented a problem since its army part was not available for many of them, and those offers had to be declined.

Seeing their opportunities limited by the strange situation, Vujović and Čolić decided to step out and form Novi ambasadori in 1970, bringing in drummer Perica Stojanović, organist Vlado Pravdić, saxophonist Lale Stefanović, and bassist Zlatko Hold. With the almost all-new lineup, the band also expanded its repertoire so that in addition to R&amp;B they now also played covers of Led Zeppelin, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Creedence Clearwater Revival, etc. In the summer of 1970, Novi ambasadori scored a month-long gig with Indexi in Dubrovnik, which was their first tour-like experience.

Next step was competing at the 1971 annual festival in Sarajevo where they finished in 7th place with a song &quot;Plačem za tvojim usnama&quot; that songwriter Zdenko Runjić claimed to have composed and officially signed his name under, even though it was a blatant rip-off of The Tremeloes&#x27; &quot;Suddenly You Love Me&quot; (which is a cover of Riccardo Del Turco&#x27;s &quot;Uno tranquillo&quot; ). No one from the festival noticed this plagiarism and the band avoided the controversy. The song was even released on a 7-inch single &quot;Plačem za tvojim usnama&quot; / &quot;Zapjevaj&quot; by Beograd Disk and sold surprisingly well. The performance at Vaš šlager sezone was also significant since it marked the band&#x27;s first television appearance, exposing them to a much larger audience. One of the people in that TV audience was Kornelije Kovač, an already influential and established figure in Yugoslav music circles, who immediately was intrigued by Čolić&#x27;s &quot;clean tenor and good stage presence&quot;.

Čolić was soon offered a &quot;bench role&quot; with Indexi, to fill in for their singer Davorin Popović, and even performed with them a couple of times.

===Korni grupa===
In the meantime, during the summer of 1971, Čolić finally met face to face with Kornelije Kovač who came to see Čolić play in Mostar and invited him to join his band Korni Grupa as a replacement to their departed singer Dado Topić. Unlike Amabasadori, Korni grupa performed their material and generally had a much more studious and serious approach to music, so Čolić immediately jumped at the opportunity.

On 10 September 1971, twenty-year-old Čolić left his hometown and moved to the capital Belgrade to join his new band. However, his stint with Korni grupa ultimately proved to be very short and largely unsuccessful as he never meshed well enough with the rest of the group musically, finding it hard to fit into their progressive rock style. He recorded three tracks with them, &quot;Kukavica, &quot;Gospa Mica gazdarica&quot;, and &quot;Pogledaj u nebo&quot;, all of which were released on the 7-inch single by PGP-RTB. Track &quot;Gospa Mica gazdarica&quot; managed to create minor controversy due to the slightly risque lyrics written from the perspective of a young man imploring his older female landlord to allow him into her bed—a nod to Čolić&#x27;s life at the time since he was living away from home in sublet apartments. Due to numerous complaints, the song was taken off radio playlists.

Soon, however, Čolić and Kovač agreed that it would be better for Čolić to go solo. Only six months after his arrival to Belgrade, he returned to Sarajevo determined to give his solo career a try.

==Solo career==
===Early activity: Schlager festivals===
On 15 April 1972 Čolić&#x27;s first solo move was taking part in the competitive festival in Sarajevo. He won the third audience prize as well as the interpretation award with Kemal Monteno written song &quot;Sinoć nisi bila tu&quot; that was originally meant to be sung by Josipa Lisac who opted out at the last moment.

Right away, under Kovač&#x27;s guidance Čolić managed to establish a fair amount of prominence as a solo act—and on 20 May 1972 the two appeared as guests on the very popular TV Belgrade variety show hosted by Milena Dravić and Dragan Nikolić. The same year, Čolić made further appearances at the Split Festival (with song &quot;Stara pjesma&quot;), Priština festival, and Skopje Festival (with song &quot;Moj bol&quot;), before embarking on a tour of Soviet Union together with Indexi, Bisera Veletanlić, Sabahudin Kurt, and Sabina Varešanović.

===Eurovision and more festivals===
Then came the first big break that launched him on the road to stardom. By winning at the Opatija festival with the song &quot;Gori vatra&quot; written by Kemal Monteno, Čolić got to represent SFR Yugoslavia at the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest on 7 April 1973 in Luxembourg City. The song placed poorly but became a well-respected hit at home.

Riding the wave of exposure the Eurovision appearance afforded him, Čolić continued entering competitive festivals throughout SFR Yugoslavia over the next two years with plenty of success. At Hit parada festival in Belgrade on 23 November 1974, he won with the song &quot;Ona spava&quot;, composed and written by Kornelije Kovač. Next year, 1975, Čolić bagged a few more festival wins with Kovač&#x27;s songs—Beogradsko proleće with &quot;April u Beogradu&quot;, and Vaš šlager sezone with &quot;Zvao sam je Emili&quot;. Other songs he performed at various festivals in those years were &quot;Bling blinge blinge bling&quot; (1973 Vaš šlager sezone, composed by Zdenko Runjić), &quot;Ljubav je samo riječ&quot; (1974 Beogradsko proleće, composed by Vojkan Borisavljević), and &quot;Zelena si rijeka bila&quot; (1974 Vaš šlager sezone, composed by Kemal Monteno).

Around the same time, he also signed a deal with the German arm of WEA record label and did two singles for that market. German producers thought that his name was too difficult to pronounce for their consumers so they marketed him as Dravco. Soon, however, Čolić decided not to pursue his options in that country further mostly because he was unwilling to move to Germany.

===Debut album===
His first solo album was &quot;Ti i ja&quot; (You and I), released in 1975 by Jugoton. Closely overseen by Kornelije Kovač, the album brought Čolić more hits like &quot;Vagabund&quot;, &quot;Igraš se vatrom&quot;, and &quot;Loše vino&quot; (written by Arsen Dedić and Goran Bregović). Cover sleeve was done by Dragan S. Stefanović, another collaborator who would remain with Čolić for years to come. Čolić&#x27;s image especially appealed to girls and women, something that would remain a staple of his entire career. The same year, cashing in on his sudden popularity upswing, PGP RTB released a compilation of his festival singles under the name Zdravko Čolić.

Despite, achieving great prominence already, Čolić continued appearing at the occasional festival such as the Zagreb one in 1976 where he surprisingly finished in fourth place singing &quot;Ti si bila, uvijek bila&quot;. At the end of that year, he went on a Yugoslavia-wide tour with Indexi. After the Belgrade concert, the measure of his sudden fame was on public display during autograph-signing at the Jugoton store as the cordon of girls rushed the store, breaking a window glass in an attempt to get closer to him.

The next year, 1977, he did the festival circuit for the last time, first in Zagreb with &quot;Živiš u oblacima&quot;, followed by an appearance at the Festival of Patriotic Songs also in Zagreb, where he performed . That song was soon released on a 7-inch and sold 300,000 copies.

===Mass popularity===
His second album, &quot;Ako priđeš bliže&quot; (If You Come Closer), released later that year, was even more successful, creating mass hysteria among girls for his music. The copies were extremely sought-after, as 50,000 sold in the first two weeks alone. The album contained some of his best-known and liked songs such as &quot;Glavo luda&quot;, &quot;Zagrli me&quot;, &quot;Juče još&quot;, &quot;Pjevam danju, pjevam noću&quot;, &quot;Jedna zima sa Kristinom&quot;, and &quot;Produži dalje&quot;.

On 1 April 1978, he started an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice Dance Group in support of the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar occasionally on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour&#x27;s climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance even though Čolić already played two sold-out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar, with old favorites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune, and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the great tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead-up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided to make a movie about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled &quot;Pjevam danju, pjevam noću&quot; that follows Čolić from the Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour&#x27;s grand finale; however, the rain interrupted much of the concert. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.

Čolić also got the attention of Ziggy Loch, director of German WEA, who immediately after watching the Belgrade concert wanted to renew his contract. Singles with songs &quot;Jedina&quot; and &quot;Zagrli me&quot; were released for the German market as well as the disco single &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Robot Man&quot; / &quot;Light Me&quot;. However, Čolić refused to move to Germany for the second time, and instead on 14 November 1978 went to serve his mandatory Yugoslav Army stint. Twenty-seven years of age at the time, Čolić was assigned to a unit in Valjevo, before getting transferred to Belgrade, and finally Požarevac. After serving 10 months, he got out of the military service on 14 September 1979.

===1980s===
Upon his return from the army, Čolić started work on his third album—which came out in the spring of 1980, entitled &quot;Zbog tebe&quot;; it brought more hits as Čola further secured his position of the most popular pop performer in Yugoslavia.

In 1984, Čolić moved from his hometown Sarajevo to Ljubljana where he started a private business with Goran Bregović through their Kamarad label. He then lived in Zagreb for five years. 1988 saw his hit &quot;Jastreb&quot;. In 1989, he moved back to Belgrade.

===Comeback===
After his 1990 album &quot;Da ti kažem šta mi je&quot;, Čolić didn&#x27;t make another album until late 1997, when he embarked on a comeback with Komuna label album &quot;Kad bi moja bila&quot;, and regained much of his popularity. The following year, he had nine sold-out concerts at Sava Centar.

In October 2005, Čolić performed two concerts at the Belgrade Arena.

Čolić voiced Shelby Forthright (originally played by Fred Willard) in the Bosnian dub of the acclaimed 2008 Pixar release &quot;WALL-E&quot;.
In 2010, he had a big concert on the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium in Sarajevo, during his &quot;Kad pogledaš me preko ramena&quot; tour, in front of over 60,000 people. On 25 June 2011, he had the biggest concert of his career: on Ušće, in Belgrade, with over 100,000 visitors. His biggest concert to date celebrated his 40-year career milestone.

==Personal life==
At the outbreak of the Bosnian War, Čolić moved to Belgrade, and has lived there ever since. He holds a degree in economics from the University of Sarajevo. Čolić is married to wife Aleksandra Aleksić and has two daughters.

<doc id="554281" wikidata="Q215448" url="?curid=554281" title="Haiku (operating system)">
<text>Haiku, originally OpenBeOS, is a free and open-source operating system for personal computers. It is a community-driven continuation of BeOS and aims to be binary-compatible with it, but is largely a reimplementation with the exception of certain components like the Deskbar. The Haiku project began in 2001, supported by the nonprofit Haiku Inc., and the operating system remains in beta.

==History and project==
On 17 August 2001 Palm, Inc. announced the purchase of Be, Inc., marking the end of BeOS development. The day after, Michael Phipps started the OpenBeOS project to support the BeOS user community by creating an open-source, backward-compatible replacement for BeOS. Palm refused to license the BeOS code to a third-party, meaning that OpenBeOS had to be reverse-engineered. In 2003, Phipps founded the non-profit organization Haiku, Inc. in Rochester, New York, United States, to financially support development.

In 2004, the project held its first North American developers&#x27; conference, &quot;WalterCon&quot;; it was also announced on this day that OpenBeOS was renamed to Haiku to avoid infringing on Palm&#x27;s trademarks. The BeUnited.org nonprofit organization, which promoted open standards for BeOS-compatible operating system projects, announced that Haiku would be its &quot;reference platform&quot;. In February 2007, the project held a Tech Talk at Googleplex, attended by ex-Be engineers as well as Jean-Louis Gassée who voiced his support for the project. There is also an annual conference, BeGeistert, held in Germany since 1998 when BeOS was active.

== Development ==
Apart from the graphical user interface (Tracker and Deskbar, which were open sourced with BeOS 5), Haiku is original software. The modular design of BeOS allowed individual components of Haiku to initially be developed in teams in relative isolation, in many cases developing them as replacements for the BeOS components prior to the completion of other parts of the operating system.

The first project by OpenBeOS was a community-created &quot;stop-gap&quot; update for BeOS 5.0.3 in 2002, featuring open source replacement for some BeOS components. The kernel of NewOS, for x86, Dreamcast (SuperH) and PowerPC, was successfully forked that same year, and Haiku has been based on it since. The codice_1 window manager was completed in 2005. In July 2006, Haiku developer Stephan Aßmus introduced Icon-O-Matic, an icon editor, and a storage format (HVIF) with a rendering engine based on Anti-Grain Geometry. The PackageInstaller was created by Lukasz Zemczak at the 2007 Google Summer of Code.

Java support was eventually added by a team from BeUnited who had ported it to BeOS, followed by WLAN from the FreeBSD stack. Alongside a port to GCC4, the first alpha release finally arrived after seven years of development. Initially targeting full BeOS 5 compatibility, a community poll was launched to redefine the future of Haiku beyond a free software refactoring of BeOS from the late 1990s. It was decided to add support for contemporary systems, protocols, hardware, web standards, and compatibility with FLOSS libraries. On October 27, 2009, Haiku obtained Qt4 support.

The WebPositive browser was first preloaded with Alpha2, replacing BeZillaBrowser. After this, much time was spent on building a package management system, which went live in September 2013. Beta1 arrived in 2018, and one of the most notable new features was the PackageFS and package installation through the HaikuDepot and pkgman; Beta1 was the first official Haiku release to support full package management.

Wine was first ported to Haiku in 2022.

=== Release history ===
==Architecture==
As with BeOS, Haiku is written in C++ and provides an object-oriented API. The Haiku kernel is a modular hybrid kernel which began as a fork of NewOS, a modular monokernel written by former Be Inc. engineer Travis Geiselbrecht. Many features have been implemented, including a virtual file system (VFS) layer and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support. It runs on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 processors, and recently has been ported to RISC-V; there is also a port for ARM under development, but is currently far behind the x86 port.

The application program interface (API) is based on that of BeOS, which is divided into a number of &quot;kits&quot; which collect related classes together and bear some relation to the library which contains the supporting code. In 2007, Access Co Ltd, the owners of Be, Inc&#x27;s intellectual property, released the text of this (&quot;BeBook&quot;) under a Creative Commons licence. The boot loader is filesystem agnostic and can also chainload GRUB, LILO and NTLDR.

Since the Beta1 release, Haiku&#x27;s memory management includes ASLR, DEP, and SMAP.
Graphics operations and window management is handled by the app_server protocol. VESA is used as a fallback video output mode. Haiku is POSIX compatible and has translation layers for X11 and Wayland.

== User interface ==

The graphical user interface is formed of Tracker, a file manager, and the Deskbar, an always-on-top taskbar that is placed in the upper right corner of the screen containing a menu, tray, and a list of running programs. Tracker is an evolution from OpenTracker, which was released under a license with two addenda restricting the use of Be Inc. trademarks; Zeta also modified OpenTracker on their own operating system.

The icons in Haiku are named &quot;stippi&quot; and were designed by Stephan Aßmus. Aßmus also created the Haiku Vector Icon Format (HVIF), a vector storage format to store icons in Haiku, and is aimed at fast rendering and small file sizes.

== Software ==
Package management is done by the graphical application HaikuDepot, and a command-line equivalent called codice_2. Packages can also be activated by installing them from remote repositories with pkgman, or dropping them over a special &quot;packages&quot; directory. Haiku package management mounts activated packages over a read-only system directory. The Haiku package management system performs dependency solving with codice_3 from the openSUSE project.

It comes with a number of preloaded applications, such as a WebKit-based web browser WebPositive, a document reader BePDF, a simple web server PoorMan, text editors Pe and StyledEdit, an IRC client Vision, and a Bash-based terminal emulator Terminal.

===Compatibility with BeOS===
Haiku R1 aims to be compatible with BeOS 5 at both the source and binary level, allowing software written and compiled for BeOS to be compiled and run without modification on Haiku. The 64-bit version of Haiku, however, does not have BeOS compatibility at the binary level, but the API still does. (The same would apply to other non-IA32 ports, such as RISC-V.)

==Reception==
In 2013 after the release of Haiku Alpha 4, Ars Technica reviewed the operating system and praised it for being fast, but ultimately stating that it &quot;may not be much more than an interesting diversion, something to play with on a spare bit of hardware&quot;. Haiku Beta 4 was reviewed by ZDNET in 2023 where it stated: &quot;Haiku is for those who experienced either NeXT or AfterStep and want an operating system that looks and feels a bit old school but performs faster than any OS they&#x27;ve ever experienced.&quot; It further praised Haiku&#x27;s kernel, file system, and object-oriented API.

<text>Marie Nicolas Sylvestre Guillon (January 1, 1760, Paris – October 16, 1847, Montfermeil), was a French ecclesiastic, and librarian. 

He was a librarian and almoner in the household of the princesse de Lamballe. After she was killed in 1792, he fled to the provinces, where, under the name of Pastel, he practiced medicine.

A man of facile conscience, he afterward served in turn under Napoleon, the House of Bourbon and the House of Orléans and became canon of St Denis, bishop of Morocco and dean of the Sorbonne.

In May 1831, he administered Extreme Unction to the republican Abbé Grégoire despite the opposition of Hyacinthe-Louis de Quélen, Archbishop of Paris.

<doc id="554287" wikidata="Q2727150" url="?curid=554287" title="Tamazgha">
<text>Tamazgha is a fictitious entity and neologism in the Berber languages denoting the lands traditionally inhabited by the Berber peoples within the Maghreb. The term was coined in the 1970s by the Berber Academy in France and, since the late 1990s, has gained particular significance among speakers of Berber languages. Although Berberists see Tamazgha as the geographic embodiment of an imaginary once-unified Berber language and culture that had its own territory, it has never been a single political entity, and Berbers across the Maghreb did not see themselves as a single cultural or linguistic unit, nor was there a greater &quot;Berber community&quot; due to their differing cultures and languages. Despite this, certain (but not all) Berberists such as members of the Algerian separatist Movement for the Self-Determination of Kabylia use the term to imagine and describe a hypothetical federation spanning between the Canary Islands and the Siwa Oasis, a large swathe of territory including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Egypt, the Western Sahara, Burkina Faso and Senegal.

==Overview==
Historically, Berbers did not see themselves as a single cultural or linguistic unit, and there was no singular endonym for the speakers of the languages descended from what is now called Proto-Libyan nor was there a term for their land. Instead, more specific terms for each subgroup were employed such as the Kabyle term or the Shawi term . Berber peoples did not refer to themselves as Berbers/Amazigh but had their own terms to refer to their own groups and communities.

The earliest known reference to the Berber people as one group comes in the form of Arabic (), as borrowed from Ancient Greek (, &#x27;barbarian&#x27;). The Arabic word &quot;barbar&quot; was applied to the people whose language seemed very strange, hence the name &quot;Berber&quot;. Berbers started being referred to collectively as Berbers following the Arab Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th century. This word referred mostly to groups in northwest Africa. By the medieval period, Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun elevated the &quot;Berbers&quot; into a &quot;race&quot; or &quot;nation&quot;, granting them equal status with the nations of the world. This was then solidified during French colonization when the Kabyle myth developed and &#x27;Berbère&#x27; became a relatively common term of self-identification.

In an attempt to reclaim the identity from the history of colonization, the Agraw Imazighen (a Paris-based Kabyle activist association that dissolved in 1978 and was known as the Berber Academy before 1969) coined the term using the pre-existing triconsonantal root &quot;M-Z-Ɣ&quot; in the 1970s to refer to the lands where the different Berber languages were spoken.

The term has been translated into Spanish as Mazigia, abbreviated as MZG and used as an alternative international license plate code for some people.

<text>A current mirror is a circuit designed to copy a current through one active device by controlling the current in another active device of a circuit, keeping the output current constant regardless of loading. The current being &quot;copied&quot; can be, and sometimes is, a varying signal current. Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal &quot;inverting current amplifier&quot; that reverses the current direction as well, or it could consist of a current-controlled current source (CCCS). The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits. It can also be used to model a more realistic current source (since ideal current sources do not exist).

The circuit topology covered here is one that appears in many monolithic ICs. It is a Widlar mirror without an emitter degeneration resistor in the follower (output) transistor. This topology can only be done in an IC, as the matching has to be extremely close and cannot be achieved with discretes.

Another topology is the Wilson current mirror. The Wilson mirror solves the Early effect voltage problem in this design.

Current mirrors are applied in both analog and mixed VLSI circuits.

== Mirror characteristics ==
There are three main specifications that characterize a current mirror. The first is the transfer ratio (in the case of a current amplifier) or the output current magnitude (in the case of a constant current source CCS). The second is its AC output resistance, which determines how much the output current varies with the voltage applied to the mirror. The third specification is the minimum voltage drop across the output part of the mirror necessary to make it work properly. This minimum voltage is dictated by the need to keep the output transistor of the mirror in active mode. The range of voltages where the mirror works is called the compliance range and the voltage marking the boundary between good and bad behavior is called the compliance voltage. There are also a number of secondary performance issues with mirrors, for example, temperature stability.

== Practical approximations ==
For small-signal analysis the current mirror can be approximated by its equivalent Norton impedance.

In large-signal hand analysis, a current mirror is usually and simply approximated by an ideal current source. However, an ideal current source is unrealistic in several respects:
* it has infinite AC impedance, while a practical mirror has finite impedance
* it provides the same current regardless of voltage, that is, there are no compliance range requirements
* it has no frequency limitations, while a real mirror has limitations due to the parasitic capacitances of the transistors
* the ideal source has no sensitivity to real-world effects like noise, power-supply voltage variations and component tolerances.

== Circuit realizations of current mirrors ==

=== Basic idea ===
A bipolar transistor can be used as the simplest &quot;current-to-current converter&quot; but its transfer ratio would highly depend on temperature variations, &quot;β&quot; tolerances, etc. To eliminate these undesired disturbances, a current mirror is composed of two cascaded &quot;current-to-voltage&quot; and &quot;voltage-to-current&quot; converters placed at the same conditions and having reverse characteristics. It is not obligatory for them to be linear; the only requirement is their characteristics to be mirrorlike (for example, in the BJT current mirror below, they are logarithmic and exponential). Usually, two identical converters are used but the characteristic of the first one is reversed by applying a negative feedback. Thus a current mirror consists of two cascaded equal converters (the first – reversed and the second – direct).
=== Basic BJT current mirror ===
If a voltage is applied to the BJT base-emitter junction as an input quantity and the collector current is taken as an output quantity, the transistor will act as an &quot;exponential voltage-to-current converter&quot;. By applying a negative feedback (simply joining the base and collector) the transistor can be &quot;reversed&quot; and it will begin acting as the opposite &quot;logarithmic current-to-voltage converter&quot;; now it will adjust the &quot;output&quot; base-emitter voltage so as to pass the applied &quot;input&quot; collector current.

The simplest bipolar current mirror (shown in Figure 1) implements this idea. It consists of two cascaded transistor stages acting accordingly as a &quot;reversed&quot; and &quot;direct&quot; voltage-to-current converters. The emitter of transistor Q1 is connected to ground. Its collector and base are tied together, so its collector-base voltage is zero. Consequently, the voltage drop across Q1 is &quot;V&quot;BE, that is, this voltage is set by the diode law and Q1 is said to be diode connected. (See also Ebers-Moll model.) It is important to have Q1 in the circuit instead of a simple diode, because Q1 sets &quot;V&quot;BE for transistor Q2. If Q1 and Q2 are matched, that is, have substantially the same device properties, and if the mirror output voltage is chosen so the collector-base voltage of Q2 is also zero, then the &quot;V&quot;BE-value set by Q1 results in an emitter current in the matched Q2 that is the same as the emitter current in Q1. Because Q1 and Q2 are matched, their &quot;β&quot;0-values also agree, making the mirror output current the same as the collector current of Q1.

The current delivered by the mirror for arbitrary collector-base reverse bias, &quot;V&quot;CB, of the output transistor is given by:
: formula_1
where &quot;IS&quot; is the reverse saturation current or scale current; &quot;V&quot;T, the thermal voltage; and &quot;V&quot;A, the Early voltage. This current is related to the reference current &quot;I&quot;ref when the output transistor &quot;V&quot;CB = 0 V by:
: formula_2
as found using Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law at the collector node of Q1:
: formula_3

The reference current supplies the collector current to Q1 and the base currents to both transistors – when both transistors have zero base-collector bias, the two base currents are equal, IB1 = IB2 = IB.
: formula_4

Parameter &quot;β&quot;0 is the transistor &quot;β&quot;-value for &quot;V&quot;CB = 0 V.

==== Output resistance ====
If &quot;V&quot;BC is greater than zero in output transistor Q2, the collector current in Q2 will be somewhat larger than for Q1 due to the Early effect. In other words, the mirror has a finite output (or Norton) resistance given by the &quot;r&quot;o of the output transistor, namely:
: formula_5

where &quot;V&quot;A is the Early voltage; and &quot;V&quot;CE, the collector-to-emitter voltage of output transistor.

==== Compliance voltage ====
To keep the output transistor active, &quot;V&quot;CB ≥ 0 V. That means the lowest output voltage that results in correct mirror behavior, the compliance voltage, is &quot;VOUT&quot; = &quot;V&quot;CV = &quot;V&quot;BE under bias conditions with the output transistor at the output current level &quot;I&quot;C and with &quot;V&quot;CB = 0 V or, inverting the &quot;I&quot;–&quot;V&quot; relation above:
: formula_6
where &quot;V&quot;T is the thermal voltage; and &quot;I&quot;S, the reverse saturation current or scale current.

==== Extensions and complications ====
When Q2 has &quot;V&quot;CB &gt; 0 V, the transistors no longer are matched. In particular, their &quot;β&quot;-values differ due to the Early effect, with
: formula_7
where &quot;V&quot;A is the Early voltage and &quot;β&quot;0 is the transistor &quot;β&quot; for &quot;V&quot;CB = 0 V. Besides the difference due to the Early effect, the transistor &quot;β&quot;-values will differ because the &quot;β&quot;0-values depend on current, and the two transistors now carry different currents (see &quot;Gummel–Poon model&quot;).

Further, Q2 may get substantially hotter than Q1 due to the associated higher power dissipation. To maintain matching, the temperature of the transistors must be nearly the same. In integrated circuits and transistor arrays where both transistors are on the same die, this is easy to achieve. But if the two transistors are widely separated, the precision of the current mirror is compromised.

Additional matched transistors can be connected to the same base and will supply the same collector current. In other words, the right half of the circuit can be duplicated several times. Note, however, that each additional right-half transistor &quot;steals&quot; a bit of collector current from Q1 due to the non-zero base currents of the right-half transistors. This will result in a small reduction in the programmed current.

See also an example of a mirror with emitter degeneration to increase mirror resistance.

For the simple mirror shown in the diagram, typical values of formula_8 will yield a current match of 1% or better.
=== Basic MOSFET current mirror ===
The basic current mirror can also be implemented using MOSFET transistors, as shown in Figure 2. Transistor M1 is operating in the saturation or active mode, and so is M2. In this setup, the output current &quot;I&quot;OUT is directly related to &quot;I&quot;REF, as discussed next.

The drain current of a MOSFET &quot;I&quot;D is a function of both the gate-source voltage and the drain-to-gate voltage of the MOSFET given by &quot;I&quot;D = (&quot;V&quot;GS, &quot;V&quot;DG), a relationship derived from the functionality of the MOSFET device. In the case of transistor M1 of the mirror, &quot;I&quot;D = &quot;I&quot;REF. Reference current &quot;I&quot;REF is a known current, and can be provided by a resistor as shown, or by a &quot;threshold-referenced&quot; or &quot;self-biased&quot; current source to ensure that it is constant, independent of voltage supply variations.

Using &quot;V&quot;DG = 0 for transistor M1, the drain current in M1 is &quot;I&quot;D = (&quot;V&quot;GS, &quot;V&quot;DG=0), so we find: (&quot;V&quot;GS, 0) = &quot;I&quot;REF, implicitly determining the value of &quot;V&quot;GS. Thus &quot;I&quot;REF sets the value of &quot;V&quot;GS. The circuit in the diagram forces the same &quot;V&quot;GS to apply to transistor M2. If M2 is also biased with zero &quot;V&quot;DG and provided transistors M1 and M2 have good matching of their properties, such as channel length, width, threshold voltage, etc., the relationship &quot;I&quot;OUT = (&quot;V&quot;GS, &quot;V&quot;DG = 0) applies, thus setting &quot;I&quot;OUT = &quot;I&quot;REF; that is, the output current is the same as the reference current when &quot;V&quot;DG = 0 for the output transistor, and both transistors are matched.

The drain-to-source voltage can be expressed as &quot;V&quot;DS = &quot;V&quot;DG + &quot;V&quot;GS. With this substitution, the Shichman–Hodges model provides an approximate form for function (&quot;V&quot;GS, &quot;V&quot;DG):
: formula_9
where formula_10 is a technology-related constant associated with the transistor, &quot;W&quot;/&quot;L&quot; is the width to length ratio of the transistor, formula_11 is the gate-source voltage, formula_12 is the threshold voltage, &quot;λ&quot; is the channel length modulation constant, and formula_13 is the drain-source voltage.

==== Output resistance ====
Because of channel-length modulation, the mirror has a finite output (or Norton) resistance given by the &quot;r&quot;o of the output transistor, namely (see channel length modulation):
: formula_14
where &quot;λ&quot; = channel-length modulation parameter and &quot;V&quot;DS is the drain-to-source bias.

==== Compliance voltage ====
To keep the output transistor resistance high, &quot;V&quot;DG ≥ 0 V. (see Baker). That means the lowest output voltage that results in correct mirror behavior, the compliance voltage, is &quot;V&quot;OUT = &quot;V&quot;CV = &quot;V&quot;GS for the output transistor at the output current level with &quot;V&quot;DG = 0 V, or using the inverse of the &quot;f&quot;-function, −1:
: formula_15

For the Shichman–Hodges model, −1 is approximately a square-root function.

==== Extensions and reservations ====
A useful feature of this mirror is the linear dependence of &quot;f&quot; upon device width &quot;W&quot;, a proportionality approximately satisfied even for models more accurate than the Shichman–Hodges model. Thus, by adjusting the ratio of widths of the two transistors, multiples of the reference current can be generated.

The Shichman–Hodges model is accurate only for rather dated technology, although it often is used simply for convenience even today. Any quantitative design based upon new technology uses computer models for the devices that account for the changed current-voltage characteristics. Among the differences that must be accounted for in an accurate design is the failure of the square law in &quot;V&quot;gs for voltage dependence and the very poor modeling of &quot;V&quot;ds drain voltage dependence provided by &quot;λV&quot;ds. Another failure of the equations that proves very significant is the inaccurate dependence upon the channel length &quot;L&quot;. A significant source of &quot;L&quot;-dependence stems from λ, as noted by Gray and Meyer, who also note that &quot;λ&quot; usually must be taken from experimental data.

Due to the wide variation of &quot;V&quot;th even within a particular device number discrete versions are problematic. Although the variation can be somewhat compensated for by using a Source degenerate resistor its value becomes so large that the output resistance suffers (i.e. reduces). This variation relegates the MOSFET version to the IC/monolithic arena.

=== Feedback-assisted current mirror ===
Figure 3 shows a mirror using negative feedback to increase output resistance. Because of the op amp, these circuits are sometimes called gain-boosted current mirrors. Because they have relatively low compliance voltages, they also are called wide-swing current mirrors. A variety of circuits based upon this idea are in use, particularly for MOSFET mirrors because MOSFETs have rather low intrinsic output resistance values. A MOSFET version of Figure 3 is shown in Figure 4, where MOSFETs M3 and M4 operate in ohmic mode to play the same role as emitter resistors &quot;R&quot;E in Figure 3, and MOSFETs M1 and M2 operate in active mode in the same roles as mirror transistors Q1 and Q2 in Figure 3. An explanation follows of how the circuit in Figure 3 works.

The operational amplifier is fed the difference in voltages &quot;V&quot;1 − &quot;V&quot;2 at the top of the two emitter-leg resistors of value &quot;R&quot;E. This difference is amplified by the op amp and fed to the base of output transistor Q2. If the collector base reverse bias on Q2 is increased by increasing the applied voltage &quot;V&quot;A, the current in Q2 increases, increasing &quot;V&quot;2 and decreasing the difference &quot;V&quot;1 − &quot;V&quot;2 entering the op amp. Consequently, the base voltage of Q2 is decreased, and &quot;V&quot;BE of Q2 decreases, counteracting the increase in output current.

If the op-amp gain &quot;A&quot;v is large, only a very small difference &quot;V&quot;1 − &quot;V&quot;2 is sufficient to generate the needed base voltage &quot;V&quot;B for Q2, namely
: formula_16

Consequently, the currents in the two leg resistors are held nearly the same, and the output current of the mirror is very nearly the same as the collector current &quot;IC1&quot; in &quot;Q1&quot;, which in turn is set by the reference current as
: formula_17
where &quot;β&quot;1 for transistor Q1 and &quot;β&quot;2 for Q2 differ due to the Early effect if the reverse bias across the collector-base of Q2 is non-zero.

==== Output resistance ====

An idealized treatment of output resistance is given in the footnote. A small-signal analysis for an op amp with finite gain &quot;A&quot;v but otherwise ideal is based upon Figure 5 (&quot;β&quot;, &quot;r&quot;O and &quot;r&quot;π refer to Q2). To arrive at Figure 5, notice that the positive input of the op amp in Figure 3 is at AC ground, so the voltage input to the op amp is simply the AC emitter voltage &quot;V&quot;e applied to its negative input, resulting in a voltage output of −&quot;A&quot;v &quot;V&quot;e. Using Ohm&#x27;s law across the input resistance &quot;r&quot;π determines the small-signal base current &quot;I&quot;b as:
: formula_18

Combining this result with Ohm&#x27;s law for formula_19, formula_20 can be eliminated, to find:
:formula_21

Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law from the test source &quot;I&quot;X to the ground of &quot;R&quot;E provides:
: formula_22

Substituting for &quot;I&quot;b and collecting terms the output resistance &quot;R&quot;out is found to be:
: formula_23

For a large gain &quot;A&quot;v ≫ &quot;r&quot;π / &quot;R&quot;E the maximum output resistance obtained with this circuit is
: formula_24
a substantial improvement over the basic mirror where &quot;R&quot;out = &quot;r&quot;O.

The small-signal analysis of the MOSFET circuit of Figure 4 is obtained from the bipolar analysis by setting &quot;β&quot; = &quot;g&quot;m &quot;r&quot;π in the formula for &quot;R&quot;out and then letting &quot;r&quot;π → ∞. The result is
: formula_25

This time, &quot;R&quot;E is the resistance of the source-leg MOSFETs M3, M4. Unlike Figure 3, however, as &quot;A&quot;v is increased (holding &quot;R&quot;E fixed in value), &quot;R&quot;out continues to increase, and does not approach a limiting value at large &quot;A&quot;v.

==== Compliance voltage ====
For Figure 3, a large op amp gain achieves the maximum &quot;R&quot;out with only a small &quot;R&quot;E. A low value for &quot;R&quot;E means &quot;V&quot;2 also is small, allowing a low compliance voltage for this mirror, only a voltage &quot;V&quot;2 larger than the compliance voltage of the simple bipolar mirror. For this reason this type of mirror also is called a &quot;wide-swing current mirror&quot;, because it allows the output voltage to swing low compared to other types of mirror that achieve a large &quot;R&quot;out only at the expense of large compliance voltages.

With the MOSFET circuit of Figure 4, like the circuit in Figure 3, the larger the op amp gain &quot;A&quot;v, the smaller &quot;R&quot;E can be made at a given &quot;R&quot;out, and the lower the compliance voltage of the mirror.

=== Other current mirrors ===
There are many sophisticated current mirrors that have higher output resistances than the basic mirror (more closely approach an ideal mirror with current output independent of output voltage) and produce currents less sensitive to temperature and device parameter variations and to circuit voltage fluctuations. These multi-transistor mirror circuits are used both with bipolar and MOS transistors. These circuits include:
* the Widlar current source
* the Wilson current mirror used as a current source
* Cascoded current sources

<doc id="554299" wikidata="Q29478" url="?curid=554299" title="Goethe's Faust">
<text>Faust is a tragic play in two parts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, usually known in English as &quot;Faust, Part One&quot; and &quot;Faust, Part Two&quot;. Nearly all of Part One and the majority of Part Two are written in rhymed verse. Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. &quot;Faust&quot; is considered by many to be Goethe&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and the greatest work of German literature.

The earliest forms of the work, known as the &quot;&quot;, were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are not entirely clear. &quot;Urfaust&quot; has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining 1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886.

The first appearance of the work in print was &quot;Faust, a Fragment&quot;, published in 1790. Goethe completed a preliminary version of what is now known as &quot;Part One&quot; in 1806. Its publication in 1808 was followed by the revised 1828–29 edition, the last to be edited by Goethe himself.

Goethe finished writing &quot;Faust, Part Two&quot; in 1831; it was published posthumously the following year. In contrast to &quot;Faust, Part One&quot;, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe&#x27;s last years.

==Nomenclature==
The original 1808 German title page of Goethe&#x27;s play read simply: &quot;Faust. / Eine Tragödie&quot; (&quot;Faust. / A Tragedy&quot;). The addition of &quot;erster Teil&quot; (in English, &quot;Part One&quot;) was retroactively applied by publishers when the sequel was published in 1832 with a title page which read: &quot;Faust. / Der Tragödie zweiter Teil&quot; (&quot;Faust. / The Tragedy&#x27;s Second Part&quot;).

The two plays have been published in English under a number of titles, and are usually referred to as &quot;Faust&quot;, Parts One and Two.

==&quot;Faust, Part One&quot;==
The principal characters of &quot;Faust Part One&quot; include:

* Heinrich Faust (see also Faust), a scholar, sometimes said to be based on Johann Georg Faust, or on Jacob Bidermann&#x27;s dramatized account of the &quot;Legend of the Doctor of Paris&quot;, &quot;Cenodoxus&quot;
* Mephistopheles, the Devil
* Gretchen, Faust&#x27;s love (short for Margarete; Goethe uses both forms)
* Marthe Schwerdtlein, Gretchen&#x27;s neighbour
* Valentin, Gretchen&#x27;s brother
* Wagner, Faust&#x27;s attendant

&quot;Faust, Part One&quot; takes place in multiple settings, the first of which is Heaven. Mephistopheles (Satan) makes a bet with God: he says that he can lure God&#x27;s favourite human (Faust), who is striving to learn everything that can be known, away from righteous pursuits. The next scene takes place in Faust&#x27;s study where the aging scholar, struggling with what he considers the vanity and uselessness of scientific, humanistic, and religious learning, turns to magic for the showering of infinite knowledge. He suspects, however, that his attempts are failing. Frustrated, he ponders suicide, but rejects it as he hears the echo of nearby Easter celebrations begin. He goes for a walk with his assistant Wagner and is followed home by a stray poodle.

In Faust&#x27;s study, the poodle transforms into Mephistopheles, dressed as a travelling student who refuses to give his name. He reveals to Faust that although the misshapen pentagram carved into Faust&#x27;s doorway has allowed him to enter, he cannot leave. Faust is surprised that Mephistopheles is bound by mystical laws, and from this reasons that he could make a pact. Mephistopheles says that he is willing to make a deal but wishes to leave for the night. Faust refuses to release him because he believes it would be impossible for him to catch Mephistopheles again. Mephistopheles then tricks him into permitting a demonstration of his power; Faust falls asleep listening to the song of the spirits, allowing Mephistopheles to escape by calling upon rats to chew away the pentagram.

The next morning Mephistopheles returns. He tells Faust that he wishes to serve him in life, and in return Faust must serve him in the afterlife. Faust is willing to accept but is concerned that accepting the services of Mephistopheles will bring him to ruin. To avoid this fate, Faust makes a wager: if Mephistopheles can grant Faust an experience of transcendence on Earth—a moment so blissful that he wishes to remain in it forever, ceasing to strive further—then he will instantly die and serve the Devil in Hell. Mephistopheles accepts the wager.

When Mephistopheles tells Faust to sign the pact with blood, Faust complains that Mephistopheles does not trust Faust&#x27;s word of honour. In the end, Mephistopheles wins the argument and Faust signs the contract with a drop of his own blood. Faust has a few excursions and then meets Margaret (also known as Gretchen). He is attracted to her and with jewellery and with help from a neighbour, Marthe, Mephistopheles draws Gretchen into Faust&#x27;s arms. With Mephistopheles&#x27; aid, Faust seduces Gretchen. Gretchen&#x27;s mother dies from a sleeping potion, administered by Gretchen to obtain privacy so that Faust could visit her. Gretchen discovers she is pregnant. Gretchen&#x27;s brother condemns Faust, challenges him and falls dead at the hands of Faust and Mephistopheles. Gretchen drowns her illegitimate child and is convicted of the murder. Faust tries to save Gretchen from death by attempting to free her from prison. Finding that she refuses to escape, Faust and Mephistopheles flee the dungeon, while voices from Heaven announce that Gretchen shall be saved – &quot;&quot; – this differs from the harsher ending of &quot;Urfaust&quot; – &quot;&quot; – &quot;she is condemned.&quot;

==&quot;Faust, Part Two&quot;==


Rich in classical allusion, in &quot;Part Two&quot; the romantic story of the first Faust is put aside, and Faust wakes in a field of fairies to initiate a new cycle of adventures and purpose. The piece consists of five acts (relatively isolated episodes) each representing a different theme. Ultimately, Faust goes to Heaven. He had lost his wager with Mephistopheles, that he would never seek to remain in a transcendental moment and have it prolonged forever. However, God had won his wager from the Prologue (and thus Faust&#x27;s soul) as the transcendental moment was derived from his righteous pursuits. Angels, who arrive as messengers of divine mercy, declare at the end of Act V: &quot;He who strives on and lives to strive / Can earn redemption still&quot; (V, 11936–7).

==Relationship between the parts==
Throughout &quot;Part One&quot;, Faust remains unsatisfied; the ultimate conclusion of the tragedy and the outcome of the wagers are only revealed in &quot;Faust, Part Two&quot;. The first part represents the &quot;small world&quot; and takes place in Faust&#x27;s own local, temporal milieu. In contrast, &quot;Part Two&quot; takes place in the &quot;wide world&quot; or &quot;macrocosmos&quot;.

==Translations==
In 1821, a partial English verse translation of &quot;Faust&quot; (Part One) was published anonymously by the London publisher Thomas Boosey and Sons, with illustrations by the German engraver Moritz Retzsch. This translation was attributed to the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge by Frederick Burwick and James C. McKusick in their 2007 Oxford University Press edition, &quot;Faustus: From the German of Goethe, Translated by Samuel Taylor Coleridge&quot;. In a letter dated 4 September 1820, Goethe wrote to his son August that Coleridge was translating &quot;Faust&quot;. However, this attribution is controversial: Roger Paulin, William St. Clair, and Elinor Shaffer provide a lengthy rebuttal to Burwick and McKusick, offering evidence including Coleridge&#x27;s repeated denials that he had ever translated &quot;Faustus&quot; and arguing that Goethe&#x27;s letter to his son was based on misinformation from a third party.

Coleridge&#x27;s fellow Romantic Percy Bysshe Shelley produced admired fragments of a translation first publishing Part One Scene II in &quot;The Liberal&quot; magazine in 1822, with &quot;Scene I&quot; (in the original, the &quot;Prologue in Heaven&quot;) being published in the first edition of his &quot;Posthumous Poems&quot; by Mary Shelley in 1824.

* In 1828, at the age of twenty, Gérard de Nerval published a French translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;.
* In 1850, Anna Swanwick released an English translation of &quot;Part One&quot;. In 1878, she published a translation of &quot;Part Two&quot;. Her translation is considered among the best.
* In 1870–71, Bayard Taylor published an English translation in the original metres. This translation, which he is best known for, is considered one of the finest and consistently remained in print for a century.
* Calvin Thomas: &quot;Part One&quot; (1892) and &quot;Part Two&quot; (1897) for D. C. Heath.
* Alice Raphael: &quot;Part One&quot; (1930) for Jonathan Cape.
* Mori Ōgai: 1913 both parts into Japanese.
* Guo Moruo: &quot;Part One&quot; (1928) and &quot;Part Two&quot; (1947) into Chinese.
* Philosopher Walter Kaufmann was also known for an English translation of &quot;Faust&quot;, presenting Part One in its entirety, with selections from Part Two, and omitted scenes extensively summarized. Kaufmann&#x27;s version preserves Goethe&#x27;s metres and rhyme schemes, but objected to translating all of Part Two into English, believing that &quot;To let Goethe speak English is one thing; to transpose into English his attempt to imitate Greek poetry in German is another.&quot;
* Phillip Wayne: &quot;Part One&quot; (1949) and &quot;Part Two&quot; (1959) for Penguin Books.
* Louis MacNeice: In 1949, the BBC commissioned an abridged translation for radio. It was published in 1952.

In August 1950, Boris Pasternak&#x27;s Russian translation of the first part led him to be attacked in the Soviet literary journal &quot;Novy Mir&quot;. The attack read in part,
... the translator clearly distorts Goethe&#x27;s ideas... in order to defend the reactionary theory of &#x27;pure art&#x27; ... he introduces an aesthetic and individualist flavor into the text... attributes a reactionary idea to Goethe... distorts the social and philosophical meaning...

In response, Pasternak wrote to Ariadna Efron, the exiled daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva:
There was some alarm when my &quot;Faust&quot; was torn to pieces in &quot;Novy mir&quot; on the basis that supposedly the gods, angels, witches, spirits, the madness of poor Gretchen and everything &#x27;irrational&#x27; was rendered too well, whereas Goethe&#x27;s progressive ideas (which ones?) were left in the shade and unattended.

<text>A mahout is an elephant rider, trainer, or keeper. Mahouts were used since antiquity for both civilian and military use. Traditionally, mahouts came from ethnic groups with generations of elephant keeping experience, with a mahout retaining his elephant throughout its working life or service years. 

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;mahout&quot; derives from the Hindi words &quot;mahaut&quot; (महौत) and &quot;mahavat&quot; (महावत), and originally from the Sanskrit &quot;mahamatra&quot; (महामात्र).

Another term is &quot;cornac&quot; or &quot;kornak&quot;, which entered many European languages via Portuguese. This word derives ultimately from the Sanskrit term &quot;karināyaka&quot;, a compound of &quot;karin&quot; (elephant) and &quot;nayaka&quot; (leader). In Kannada, a person who takes care of elephants is called a &quot;maavuta,&quot; and in Telugu the word used is &quot;mavati&quot;; this word is also derived from Sanskrit. In Tamil, the word used is &quot;pahan&quot;, which means &quot;elephant keeper&quot;, and in Sinhala (&quot;stable master&quot;). In Malayalam the word used is &quot;paappaan&quot;.

In Burma, the profession is called &quot;u-si&quot;; in Thailand &quot;kwan-chang&quot; (ควาญช้าง); and in Vietnam &quot;quản tượng&quot;.

== Equipment ==
The most common tools used by mahouts are chains and the &quot;aṅkuśa&quot; (goad, also &quot;ankus&quot; or &quot;anlius&quot;) – a sharp metal hook used as guide in the training and handling of the elephant.

In India, especially Kerala, mahouts use three types of device to control elephants. The &quot;thotti&quot; (hook), which is 3.5 feet in length and about 1 inch thick; the &quot;valiya kol&quot; (long pole), which is 10.5 feet in length and about 1 inch in thickness; and the &quot;cheru kol&quot; (short pole).

== Society ==
Elephants, and therefore also mahouts, have long been integral to politics and the economy throughout Southern and South-eastern Asia. The animals are given away per request of government ministers and sometimes as gifts. In addition to more traditional occupations, today mahouts are employed in many countries by forestry services and the logging industry, as well as in tourism.

== Culture ==

Elephants can remember tone, melody, and words, allowing them to recognise more than 20 verbal commands. The Singapore Zoo featured a show called &quot;elephants at work and play&quot; until 2018, where the elephants&#x27; caretakers were referred to as &quot;mahouts&quot;, and demonstrated how elephants are used as beasts of burden in south-east Asia. The verbal commands given to the elephants by the mahouts are all in Sinhala, one of the two official languages of Sri Lanka.

A shop display advertising &quot;Mahout&quot; cigarettes features prominently in the background of the &quot;rain dance&quot; sequence of the 1952 Gene Kelly film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. The word &quot;mahout&quot; also features in the lyrics of the song &quot;Drop the Pilot&quot;, by Joan Armatrading.

George Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; discusses the relationship of an elephant to its mahout: &quot;It was not, of course, a wild elephant, but a tame one which had gone &#x27;must.&#x27; It had been chained up, as tame elephants always are when their attack of &#x27;must&#x27; is due, but on the previous night it had broken its chain and escaped. Its mahout, the only person who could manage it when it was in that state, had set out in pursuit, but had taken the wrong direction and was now twelve hours&#x27; journey away...&quot;

<text>The bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), sometimes referred to as &quot;bream&quot;, &quot;brim&quot;, &quot;sunny&quot;, or, as is common in Texas, &quot;copper nose&quot;, is a species of North American freshwater fish, native to and commonly found in streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and wetlands east of the Rocky Mountains. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Lepomis&quot; (true sunfish), from the family Centrarchidae (sunfishes, crappies and black basses) in the order Centrarchiformes. 

Bluegills can grow up to long and about . While their color can vary from population to population, they typically have a very distinctive coloring, with deep blue and purple on the face and gill cover, dark olive-colored bands down the side, and a fiery orange to yellow belly. They are omnivorous and will consume anything they can fit in their mouth, but mostly feed on small aquatic insects and baitfishes. The fish are important prey for bass, other larger sunfish, northern pike and muskellunge, walleye, trout, herons, kingfishers, snapping turtles and otters, and play a key role within the food chain of its freshwater ecosystem.

A popular panfish among anglers, bluegill usually hide around and inside old tree stumps in swamps and other underwater structures (e.g. snags), and can live in either deep or very shallow water. Bluegills also like to find shelter among aquatic plants and in the shade of trees along banks, and will often move from one cover to another depending on the time of day or season.

==Description==
The bluegill is noted for the large black appendage (the &quot;ear&quot;) on each side of the posterior edge of the gill covers as well as the base of the dorsal fin. The sides of its head and chin are commonly a dark shade of blue, hence the name &quot;bluegill&quot;. The precise coloration will vary due to the presence of neurally controlled chromatophores under the skin. The fish usually displays 5–9 vertical bars on the sides of its body immediately after being caught as part of its threat display. It typically has a yellowish breast and abdomen, with the breast of the breeding male being a bright orange. The bluegill has three anal fin spines, ten to 12 anal fin rays, six to 13 dorsal fin spines, 11 to 12 dorsal rays, and 12 to 13 pectoral rays. They are characterized by their deep, flattened bodies. They have a terminal mouth, ctenoid scales, and a lateral line that is arched upward anteriorly.

The bluegill typically ranges in size from about , and reaches a maximum size just over . The largest bluegill ever caught was in 1950.

The bluegill is most closely related to the orangespotted sunfish and the redear sunfish, but different in a distinct spot at or near the base of the soft dorsal fin.

=== Potential subspecies ===
Bluegills are sometimes split into three subspecies, although their validity is contested. This includes the northern bluegill (&quot;L. m. macrochirus&quot;), the coppernose bluegill (&quot;L. m. purpurascens&quot;), and the southwestern bluegill (&quot;L. m. speciosus&quot;).
==Distribution and habitat==
The bluegill occurs naturally in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains from coastal Virginia to Florida, west to Texas and northern Mexico, and north to western Minnesota, New York and southeastern Ontario. They have been introduced widely in North America and Europe, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Asia, South America, and Oceania. Bluegills have also been found in the Chesapeake Bay, indicating they can tolerate up to 1.8% salinity.

In some locations where they have been transplanted, they are considered pests: trade in the species is prohibited in Germany and Japan. In the case of Japan, bluegills were presented to the then-crown prince, Akihito, in 1960 as a gift by Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago. The prince, in turn, donated the fish to fishery research agencies in Japan, from which they escaped and became an invasive species that wreaked havoc with native species, especially in Lake Biwa. Akihito has since apologized.

Bluegill live in the shallow waters of many lakes and ponds, along with streams, creeks, and rivers. They prefer water with many aquatic plants, and seclude themselves within or near fallen logs, water weeds or any other structure (natural or manmade) that is under water. They can often be found around weed beds, where they search for food or spawn. In the summer, adults move to deep, open water where they suspend just below the surface and feed on plankton and other aquatic creatures. Bluegill try to spend most of their time in water from , and tend to have a home range of about during nonreproductive months. They enjoy heat, but do not like direct sunlight – they typically live in deeper water, but will linger near the water surface in the morning to stay warm. Bluegill are usually found in schools of 10 to 20 fish, and these schools will often include other panfish, such as crappie, pumpkinseeds, and smallmouth bass.

==Ecology==

Young bluegills&#x27; diet consists of rotifers, copepods, water fleas, and insects (mainly chironomids). The adult diet consists of aquatic insect larvae (mayflies, caddisflies, dragonflies), but can also include terrestrial insects, zooplankton, shrimp, crayfish, leeches, other worms, snails, and other small fish (such as minnows). If food is scarce, bluegill will also feed on aquatic vegetation and algae, and if scarce enough, will even feed on their own eggs or offspring. As bluegill spend a great deal of time near the surface of water, they can also feed on surface bugs. Most bluegills feed during daylight hours, with a feeding peak being observed in the morning and evening (with the major peak occurring in the evening). Feeding location tends to be a balance between food abundance and predator abundance. Bluegill use gill rakers and bands of small teeth to ingest their food. During summer months, bluegills generally consume 3.2 percent of their body weight each day. To capture prey, bluegills use a suction system in which they accelerate water into their mouth. Prey comes in with this water. Only a limited amount of water is able to be suctioned, so the fish must get within 1.75 centimeters of the prey.

In turn, bluegill are prey to many larger species, including largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, striped bass, trout, muskellunge, turtles, northern pike, yellow perch, walleye, catfish, and even larger bluegill. Herons, kingfishers, and otters have also been witnessed catching bluegill in shallow water. However, the shape of the fish makes them hard to swallow. Raccoons are also believed to be among their predators.

==Adaptations==
Bluegills have the ability to travel and change directions at high speeds by means of synchronized fin movements. They use notched caudal fins, soft dorsal fins, body undulations, and pectoral fins to move forward. Having a notched caudal fin allows them to accelerate quickly. The speed of their forward motion depends on the strength of which they abduct or adduct fins. The flat, slender body of the bluegill lowers water resistance and allows the bluegills to cut effectively through water. The large, flexible pectoral fins allow the fish to decelerate quickly. This superior maneuverability allows the bluegill to forage and escape predators very successfully. Bluegills have a lateral line system, as well as inner ears, that act as receptors for vibration and pressure changes. However, bluegills rely heavily on sight to feed, especially in their foraging. Optimal vision occurs in the daylight hours. The mouth of the bluegill is very small and requires the use of the pharynx to suck in prey.

=== Standard and backward swimming ===
The bluegill sunfish relies heavily on the flexibility of its fins to maintain maneuverability in response to fluid forces. The bluegill&#x27;s segmentation in its pectoral fin rays mitigates the effects of fluid forces on the fish&#x27;s movement. The bluegill has a variety of unusual adaptations that allow it to navigate different environments. In conditions where the bluegill is deprived of its various sensory abilities, it utilizes its pectoral fins in navigation. If the bluegill&#x27;s visual input or lateral line input were to be compromised, its pectoral fins are then able to be utilized as mechanosensors through the bending of the fin(s) when the fish comes into contact with its environment. In standard swimming the bluegill sunfish relies on its caudal (tail) fin, dorsal fin, and anal fin. The bluegill&#x27;s caudal fin muscles are important in the fish&#x27;s slow swimming and also important in the beginning stages of the fish increasing its swimming speed. The dorsal and anal fins are two types of median fins that work in parallel to balance torque during steady swimming.

When swimming backwards, the bluegill utilizes a plethora of fin muscles located in various parts of its body. Backward swimming in the bluegill is more complex than steady swimming, as it is not just the reversal of forward swimming. The fish utilizes its pectoral fins to provide a rhythmic beat while the dorsal and anal fins produce momentum to drive the fish backwards. The pectoral fins&#x27; rhythmic beat is asymmetric and aids the fish&#x27;s balance in its slow, backward movement.

=== C-start escape response ===
The bluegill, amongst a wide array of other fishes, exhibits the C-start escape response, which is generated by large neurons called Mauthner cells. Mauthner cells operate as a command center for the escape response and respond quickly once the neural pathway has been activated by an initial stimulus. The cells trigger a contraction of muscle that bends the fish body into a &#x27;C&#x27; to then aid in the propulsion away from a predator. The C-start trajectory is highly variable, allowing the fish to alter its escape response each time. Because of this high variability, predators have a lower chance of learning a successful predation technique to capture the fish. The C-start escape response produces other advantages, including the ability to move quickly and unpredictably to capture prey.

Hydrodynamically, the bluegill exhibits specific flow patterns that accompany its C-start escape response. The caudal (tail) fin is a main source of momentum in typical kinematic models of the C-start escape response but the bluegill draws a majority of its momentum from the body bending associated with the response, as well as its dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal and anal fins&#x27; roles as propulsors during escape response suggest that the size of the fins could lead to an evolutionary advantage when escaping predators.

==Reproduction and lifestyle==
Spawning season for bluegills starts late in May and extends into August. The peak of the spawning season usually occurs in June in waters of . The male bluegills arrive first at the mating site. They will make a spawning bed of six to 12 inches in diameter in shallow water, clustering as many as 50 beds together. The males scoop out these beds in gravel or sand. Males tend to be very protective and chase everything away from their nests, especially other male bluegills. Some bluegills, regardless of their small size, will even attack snorkelers if they approach the edge of the nest. As a female approaches, the male will begin circling and making grunting noises. The motion and sound of the males seem to attract the females. Females are very choosy and will usually pick males with larger bodies and &quot;ears&quot;, making larger size a desirable trait for males to have. If the female enters the nest, both the male and female will circle each other, with the male expressing very aggressive behavior toward the female. If the female stays, the pair will enter the nest and come to rest in the middle. With the male in an upright posture, the pair will touch bellies, quiver, and spawn. These actions are repeated at irregular intervals several times in a row. Once the spawning is done, the male will chase the female out of the nest and guard the eggs. The fertilization process is entirely external. The male&#x27;s sperm combines with the female&#x27;s eggs in the water. Smaller males will often hide in nearby weeds and dart into the nest as they attempt to fertilize the eggs. They then quickly dart away. The size of the female plays a large role in how many eggs will be produced. A small female can produce as few as 1,000 eggs, and a large, healthy female can produce up to 100,000 eggs. The male continues to watch over the nest until the larvae are able to hatch and swim away on their own. The bluegill generally begins its spawning career at one year of age, but has been found to spawn as early as four months of age under favorable conditions. Anglers find spawning season to be a very successful time to fish for bluegills, as they aggressively attack anything, including a hook, that comes near.

The growth of the bluegill is very rapid in the first three years, but slows considerably once the fish reaches maturity. Many fish reach five to eight years old, and in extreme cases, can live 11 years.

=== Hybridization with other species ===
Occasionally a bluegill may spawn with another member of its genus, though this is rare. This tends to happen in bodies of water that are fairly isolated and have a decent population of bluegill in close proximity to another, smaller, population of lepomid species such as green sunfish. Limited nesting grounds can also factor in hybridization causing the females of one species to prefer the nest of another. Bluegill can theoretically hybridize with all other species in the genus &quot;Lepomis&quot;, though the most common hybrid is the greengill. The hybrid fish are aggressive and have larger mouths than their bluegill parent. These fish also grow faster than other small mouth fish due to its bigger mouth. Greengills or hybrid bluegills are the most efficient in growth and can reach approximately 2 lbs or 0.91 kg in one year.

By artificially stripping and fertilizing eggs, bluegills can hybridize with centrarchid species outside of the genus &quot;Lepomis&quot;, creating intergeneric hybrids. In this manner, bluegills have been crossed with black crappie (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;) and largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;).

==Relationship with humans==
The bluegill is the state fish of Illinois.

At Lake St. Helen, Michigan, an annual &quot;Blue Gill Festival&quot; is held in July. 

===Fishing===

Bluegills are popular panfish, caught with live bait such as worms, crickets, grasshoppers, flies, minnows, maggots or small frogs, as well as small shrimp bits, processed bait, bread, corn, other table scraps, small crankbaits, spinners, fake worms, or even a bare hook. They mostly bite on vibrant colors like orange, yellow, green, or red, chiefly at dawn and dusk. They are noted for seeking out underwater vegetation for cover; their natural diet consists largely of crickets, water bugs, larvae, and very small fish. The bluegill itself is also occasionally used as bait for larger game fish species, such as blue catfish, flathead catfish and largemouth bass.

Fishermen are sometimes able to use polarized sunglasses to see through water and find bluegills&#x27; spawning beds. Bluegill have a rather bold character; many have no fear of humans, eating food directly dropped into the water, and a population in Canada&#x27;s Lake Scugog will even allow themselves to be stroked by human observers. Because of their size and the method of cooking them, bluegills are often called panfish.

The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at 2.15 kg (4 lb 12 oz) caught from Ketona lake in Alabama in 1950.

===Management===
Bluegill populations are notably vulnerable to effects of angling and harvest, particularly in size-structure. Large males appear to be especially vulnerable to effects of fishing because of their tendency to guard nests in the center of colonies. Populations with large males are increasingly difficult to find, and are usually only found in remote locations without angling pressure or in more southern regions where growth rates are high. Reduced bag limits appear to show potential for improving size-structure in over-fished populations.

In a 1973 study reported by the EPA, the waterborne administration of 180 ppm of calcium propionate was found to be slightly toxic to bluegill.

Bluegills play an important role in pond and lake management to keep crustacean and insect populations low, as a single bluegill population may eat up to six times its own weight in just one summer. However, certain species of bluegill can become overpopulated and overrun a pond&#x27;s ecosystem if not managed properly. Pond owners typically control the bluegill population by handfishing and trapping of the fish to control population size.

<doc id="554322" wikidata="Q1345371" url="?curid=554322" title="Mathieu de Montmorency">
<text>Mathieu Jean Felicité de Montmorency, 1st Duke of Montmorency-Laval (10 July 1767 – 24 March 1826) was a French statesman during the French Revolution and Bourbon Restoration. He was elected as the youngest deputy to the Estates-General of 1789. He is also known for his military expertise and his relation with Mme de Staël. When France became a republic, Montmorency turned into an ultra-royalist. Napoleon regarded him as a member of the Catholic opposition. During the Restoration, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==Early life==
Mathieu de Montomorency was born in Paris, France on 10 July 1767. He was the son of Mathieu Paul Louis de Montmorency, vicomte de Laval (1748–1809), and Catherine Jeanne Tavernier de Boullongne (d. 1838). Montmorency&#x27;s father was a scion of one of the oldest noble families in France, while his wife was the daughter of an aristocratic French planter in Guadeloupe. Montmorency went on to seek higher education at Collège du Plessis, where he developed his love for the subject of philosophy and the idea of enlightenment.

His paternal grandparents were Guy André Pierre de Montmorency-Laval, 1st Duke of Laval, and Jacqueline Hortense de Bullion de Fervaques. Among his extended family was uncle, Anne-Alexandre-Marie de Montmorency-Laval, 2nd Duke of Laval, and aunt, Guionne de Montmorency-Laval (wife of the 6th Duke of Luynes).

In 1780, his father, a colonel of the Auvergne regiment, was appointed a &quot;premier gentilhomme de la chambre&quot; to King Louis XVI of France&#x27;s younger brother, the Comte de Provence. However, when Catherine was denied the corresponding rank of &quot;dame pour accompagner&quot; to the prince&#x27;s wife, Marie-Joséphine, due to her relatively low birth, Laval resigned his post in Provence&#x27;s household. Montmorency was a very intelligent man. He was a diplomatist and a great writer. He eventually went to become a tutor for Henry, duke de Bordeaux, the grandson of Charles X.

==Career==
Originally known by the title of &quot;Comte de Montmorency-Laval&quot;, Mathieu served as an adolescent with his father in the American War of Independence with Lafayette. America was a new nation that had built its nation on democracy and liberty. Montmorency is credited for bringing these new governmental ideas to France. He became the governor of the city and castle of Compiègne, from 1804 to 1809, and from 1812 to 1814.

Montmorency was the Deputy of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury in the Estates General from 28 March 1789 until 30 September 1791, joining as its youngest member. He moved to the left side of the National Assembly, shifting from the Second Estate, the nobility. On 17 August, he was appointed as the secretary of the assembly. Montmorency fought the aristocracy under the tutelage of the abbé Sieyès. He moved the abolition of armorial bearings on 19 June 1790. 

===French Revolution===

Before 20 April 1792, he and Count de Narbonne, the Minister of War, went to inspect the troops. Around the Storming of the Tuileries in August, Montmorency fled to Coppet to live with Germaine de Staël and Arnail François, marquis de Jaucourt. In January 1793, he accompanied her to Boulogne-sur-Mer, where she sought refuge in England. On 17 June 1794, his brother, an Abbot, was guillotined. Montmorency started to study the church father, Augustine. In May 1795, he lived in Yverdon. He returned to Paris to see his relatives. He was arrested as an émigré on 26 December, but released after a few days. Montmorency lived at Château d&#x27;Ormesson fr on an estate in Ormesson-sur-Marne. De Staël and Constant joined him there and Montmorency visited them in 1797 in Luzarches.

===First French Empire===
In 1799, the Consulate seized power in a military coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1803, he again joined the Coppet group and accompanied de Staël to Paris. In May 1804, Napoleon was granted the title Emperor of the French by the French , which ended the French Consulate and began the French First Republic. In August 1811, he traveled with de Staël in Switzerland. François-Emmanuel Guignard, De Montmorency, Mme Récamier were exiled by Napoleon.

Napoleon&#x27;s army won victories in the War of the Third Coalition against Austria, Prussia, Russia, Britain, and allied states. French dominance was reaffirmed during the War of the Fourth Coalition, before Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

===Bourbon Restoration===
At the beginning of the Bourbon Restoration, he was promoted to the rank of &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;, but in March 1815, (at beginning of the Hundred Days) he accompanied Marie Thérèse of France from Bordeaux to London and met with Louis XVIII in Ghent, who was forced to flee. After the Battle of Waterloo and the final defeat of Napoleon, he was made a peer of France and received the title of &quot;Vicomte de Montmorency-Laval&quot;. He was instrumental in convincing Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu to replace his former friend and former Bonapartist Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord as the new Prime Minister of France. In 1817, Montmorency bought Vallée-aux-Loups from his friend Chateaubriand.

Known for strong reactionary, ultramontane, and Ultra-royalist views, Felicite became the French Minister of Foreign Affairs under Jean-Baptiste Guillaume Joseph, comte de Villèle in December 1821. He recommended armed intervention in Spain to restore Ferdinand VII at the Congress of Verona in October 1822. However, he resigned his post in December, being compensated by the title of &quot;Duc de Montmorency-Laval&quot; and the cross of the Legion of Honour soon after.

He was elected to the Académie Française in 1825, with few qualifications for the honour. The following year, he was named tutor to the six-year-old heir to the throne, the Duc de Bordeaux, but died two months after receiving the appointment.

==Personal life==

In 1788, Mathieu de Montmorency married his first cousin Pauline Hortense d&#x27;Albert de Luynes (1774–1858), the daughter of Louis Joseph d&#x27;Albert, 6th Duke of Luynes, and Guionne de Montmorency-Laval (a daughter of Guy André Pierre de Montmorency-Laval, 1st Duke of Laval). Her only sibling was Charles Marie d&#x27;Albert de Luynes, 7th Duke of Luynes, a member of the Chamber of Peers. Together, they were the parents of:

* Élisabeth Hélène Pierre de Montmorency-Laval (1790–1834), who married Sosthènes I de La Rochefoucauld, 2nd Duke of Doudeauville, the son of Ambroise-Polycarpe de La Rochefoucauld, 1st Duke of Doudeauville, and heiress Bénigne-Augustine Le Tellier de Louvois, in 1807. To the marriage, Elisabeth brought the Château d&#x27;Esclimont at Saint-Symphorien-le-Château and the Château de Bonnétable in Bonnétable.

The Duke died on 24 March 1826. He was discovered seated lifeless at the end of the Good Friday Liturgy in St. Thomas d&#x27;Aquin church in the fashionable St. Germain des Près faubourg. His widow, who outlived the Duke and their only child, died at her home, the Château de Bonnétable, in 1858.

===Extramarital relationships===
Despite being married he actually paid very little attention to his wife. Due to the very relaxed nature of marriages, he often was seen without his wife. In actuality, Montmorency was madly in love with another cousin by the name of Marquise de Laval. When Laval died in Summer 1790, Montmorency went to a great depression. Reportedly, Madame de Staël brought Montmorency out of his depression through writing a series of letters to each other. After the death of her husband, Albert Jean Michel de Rocca, in 1818, Montmorency became the legal guardian of de Staël&#x27;s children. Like August Schlegel, he was one of her intimates until the end of her life.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Élisabeth, he was a grandfather of six, including: Ambroisine de La Rochefoucauld (who died young); Stanislas de La Rochefoucauld, 3rd Duke of Doudeauville (who married Marie de Colbert-Chabanais); Hortense de La Rochefoucauld (who died young); Sosthène II de La Rochefoucauld, 4th Duke of Doudeauville (who was also created Duke of Bisaccia; he married Princess Yolande of Polignac, a daughter of Prime Minister Prince Jules de Polignac, and, after her death, Princess Marie de Ligne, youngest daughter of Eugène, 8th Prince of Ligne); Augustin de La Rochefoucauld (who died young); and Marie de La Rochefoucauld (who died young).

In 2006 and 2007, Kaneria played 20 Test matches for Pakistan taking 77 wickets including a five-wicket haul against West Indies at Multan in November 2006. He did not play international cricket in 2008. During the last years of his Test career, Kaneria played an important role in Pakistan&#x27;s Test wins over West Indies, England and India.

===One Day Internationals===
Kaneria made his ODI debut in October 2001 against Zimbabwe at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium; he conceded 43 runs in seven overs without taking a wicket. Kaneria played his next match 18 months later against the same team at the same ground. He bowled nine overs and took two wickets for 38 runs in that match.

He played 18 ODIs for Pakistan and took 15 wickets in the format. In ODI cricket, he has been economical so far with an economy rate under 4.8 runs per over. His best bowling in ODIs came against New Zealand in Sri Lanka in 2003 taking three wickets for 31 runs at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium.

Success in the one day arena has been more elusive, Pakistan usually opting to play the two spinning all-rounders Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik or Saeed Ajmal instead.

===County cricket===
Kaneria played English County Championship between 2004 and 2010 representing Essex. He impressed in county cricket, taking 32 wickets in seven championship matches for Essex in 2005. Although unable to play English [county cricket] in 2006 due to Pakistan&#x27;s tour of England, he returned to play for Essex in 2007, taking 107 wickets for the County in all forms of the game. He played for Essex again in 2008, although he missed the start of the campaign due to his wife giving birth to their second child. Kaneria suffered a broken finger in Essex&#x27;s LV County Championship Division Two match against Worcestershire County Cricket Club (Worcestershire CCC) at Colchester on 21 August 2008. The bowler was injured attempting to take a catch off Ben Smith. An X-ray confirmed he had broken a finger and he missed the remainder of the 2008 English domestic season.

===Match Fixing Inquiry (2010)===
In May 2010, he was inquired in connection with &quot;match irregularities&quot; in the 2009 domestic season. The investigations are believed to focus on a NatWest Pro40 match in September 2009, which Essex won. In September 2010, police told Kaneria that the investigation had been closed and that he had been cleared of any allegations.

He was selected for the two-match Test series against South Africa. Although he was a part of the training camp, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) stopped him from playing in the series. No reason was given for his exclusion from the series. He then played in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for HBL, taking 18 wickets in two games.

On 17 February 2012, during Mervyn Westfield&#x27;s trial on spot fixing charges, Kaneria was named in court as the man who approached Westfield with the idea. They were teammates at the time the alleged approach took place.
Now in June 2012, both have been found guilty of offences by an ECB disciplinary panel. As a consequence, Kaneria has been banned for life from playing cricket in England and Wales by the aforementioned panel. The PCB had previously agreed to abide by the ECB&#x27;s decision.
Kaneria appealed against the lifetime ban on him by the ECB for his involvement in a spot-fixing scandal. The appeal against English Cricket Board&#x27;s decision was denied in July 2013 for the second time, with the ECB saying &quot;We note, with regret, that Mr Kaneria has neither made any admission of guilt nor expressed any remorse for his corrupt actions, despite the weight of evidence against him.&quot;

In October 2018, after years of denying his guilt, Kaneria admitted to his involvement in the 2009 spot-fixing scandal.

==Personal life==
Kaneria is a Hindu and an ethnic Gujarati. He is married to Dharmita Kaneria (a daughter of a Varasia family) and has two children.

He is the cousin of former Pakistani wicket-keeper Anil Dalpat.

<text>Modern Hebrew ( or ), also called Israeli Hebrew or simply Hebrew, is the standard form of the Hebrew language spoken today. Developed as part of the revival of Hebrew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it is the official language of the State of Israel and the only Canaanite language still spoken as a native language. The revival of Hebrew predates the creation of the state of Israel, where it is now the national language. Modern Hebrew is often regarded as one of the most successful instances of language revitalization in history.

Hebrew, a Northwest Semitic language within the Afroasiatic language family, was spoken since antiquity and the vernacular of the Jewish people until the 3rd century BCE, when it was supplanted by Western Aramaic, a dialect of the Aramaic language, the local or dominant languages of the regions Jews migrated to, and later Judeo-Arabic, Judaeo-Spanish, Yiddish, and other Jewish languages. Although Hebrew continued to be used for Jewish liturgy, poetry and literature, and written correspondence, it became extinct as a spoken language. 

By the late 19th century, Russian-Jewish linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda had begun a popular movement to revive Hebrew as a living language, motivated by his desire to preserve Hebrew literature and a distinct Jewish nationality in the context of Zionism. Soon after, a large number of Yiddish and Judaeo-Spanish speakers were murdered in the Holocaust or fled to Israel, and many speakers of Judeo-Arabic emigrated to Israel in the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world, where many adapted to Modern Hebrew.

Currently, Hebrew is spoken by approximately 9–10 million people, counting native, fluent, and non-fluent speakers. Some 6 million of these speak it as their native language, the overwhelming majority of whom are Jews who were born in Israel or immigrated during infancy. The rest is split: 2 million are immigrants to Israel; 1.5 million are Israeli Arabs, whose first language is usually Arabic; and half a million are expatriate Israelis or diaspora Jews.

Under Israeli law, the organization that officially directs the development of Modern Hebrew is the Academy of the Hebrew Language, headquartered at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Name==
The most common scholarly term for the language is &quot;Modern Hebrew&quot; (). Most people refer to it simply as &quot;Hebrew&quot; ( ).

The term &quot;Modern Hebrew&quot; has been described as &quot;somewhat problematic&quot; as it implies unambiguous periodization from Biblical Hebrew. (חיים רוזן) supported the now widely used term &quot;Israeli Hebrew&quot; on the basis that it &quot;represented the non-chronological nature of Hebrew&quot;. In 1999, Israeli linguist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann proposed the term &quot;Israeli&quot; to represent the multiple origins of the language.

==Background==

The history of the Hebrew language can be divided into four major periods:

* Biblical Hebrew, until about the 3rd century BCE; the language of most of the Hebrew Bible
* Mishnaic Hebrew, the language of the Mishnah and Talmud
* Medieval Hebrew, from about the 6th to the 13th century CE
* Modern Hebrew, the language of the modern State of Israel

Jewish contemporary sources describe Hebrew flourishing as a spoken language in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, during about 1200 to 586 BCE. Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew remained a spoken vernacular following the Babylonian captivity, when Old Aramaic became the predominant international language in the region.

Hebrew died out as a vernacular language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining after the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE, which devastated the population of Judea. After the exile, Hebrew became restricted to liturgical and literary use.

== Revival ==
Hebrew had been spoken at various times and for many purposes throughout the Diaspora. During the Old Yishuv, it had developed into a spoken lingua franca among Palestinian Jews. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda then led a revival of the Hebrew language as a mother tongue in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Modern Hebrew used Biblical Hebrew morphemes, Mishnaic spelling and grammar, and Sephardic pronunciation. Many idioms and calques were made from Yiddish. Its acceptance by the early Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine was caused primarily by support from the organisations of Edmond James de Rothschild in the 1880s and the official status it received in the 1922 constitution of the British Mandate for Palestine. Ben-Yehuda codified and planned Modern Hebrew using 8,000 words from the Bible and 20,000 words from rabbinical commentaries. Many new words were borrowed from Arabic, due to the language&#x27;s common Semitic roots with Hebrew, but changed to fit Hebrew phonology and grammar, for example the words (sing.) and (pl.) are now applied to &#x27;socks&#x27;, a diminutive of the Arabic (&#x27;socks&#x27;). In addition, early Jewish immigrants, borrowing from the local Arabs, and later immigrants from Arab lands introduced many nouns as loanwords from Arabic (such as &quot;nana&quot;, , , , , &quot;lubiya&quot;, &quot;hummus&quot;, , , etc.), as well as much of Modern Hebrew&#x27;s slang. Despite Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s fame as the renewer of Hebrew, the most productive renewer of Hebrew words was poet Haim Nahman Bialik.

One of the phenomena seen with the revival of the Hebrew language is that old meanings of nouns were occasionally changed for altogether different meanings, such as &quot;bardelas&quot; (, a loanword from ), which in Mishnaic Hebrew meant &#x27;hyena&#x27;, but in Modern Hebrew it now means &#x27;cheetah&#x27;; or &quot;shezīph&quot; () which is now used for &#x27;plum&#x27;, but formerly meant &#x27;jujube&#x27;. The word (formerly &#x27;cucumbers&#x27;) is now applied to a variety of summer squash (&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; var. &quot;cylindrica&quot;), a plant native to the New World. Another example is the word (), which now denotes a street or a road, but is actually an Aramaic adjective meaning &#x27;trodden down&#x27; or &#x27;blazed&#x27;, rather than a common noun. It was originally used to describe a blazed trail. The flower &quot;Anemone coronaria&quot;, called in Modern Hebrew , was formerly called in Hebrew (&#x27;the king&#x27;s flower&#x27;).

For a simple comparison between the Sephardic and Yemenite versions of Mishnaic Hebrew, see Yemenite Hebrew.

== Classification ==
Modern Hebrew is classified as an Afroasiatic language of the Semitic family, the Canaanite branch of the Northwest Semitic subgroup. While Modern Hebrew is largely based on Mishnaic and Biblical Hebrew as well as Sephardi and Ashkenazi liturgical and literary tradition from the Medieval and Haskalah eras and retains its Semitic character in its morphology and in much of its syntax, some scholars posit that Modern Hebrew represents a fundamentally new linguistic system, not directly continuing any previous linguistic state, though this is not the consensus among scholars. 

Modern Hebrew is considered to be a koiné language based on historical layers of Hebrew that incorporates foreign elements, mainly those introduced during the most critical revival period between 1880 and 1920, as well as new elements created by speakers through natural linguistic evolution. A minority of scholars argue that the revived language had been so influenced by various substrate languages that it is genealogically a hybrid with Indo-European. Those theories have not been met with general acceptance, and the consensus among a majority of scholars is that Modern Hebrew, despite its non-Semitic influences, can correctly be classified as a Semitic language. Although European languages have had an impact on Modern Hebrew, the impact may often be overstated. Although Modern Hebrew has more of the features attributed to Standard Average European than Biblical Hebrew, it is still quite distant, and has fewer such features than Modern Standard Arabic.

== Alphabet ==

Modern Hebrew is written from right to left using the Hebrew alphabet, which is an abjad, or consonant-only script of 22 letters based on the &quot;square&quot; letter form, known as &quot;Ashurit&quot; (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A cursive script is used in handwriting. When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letters known as &quot;Nikkud&quot;, or by use of &quot;Matres lectionis&quot;, which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics like Dagesh and Sin and Shin dots are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. &quot;bet&quot;/&quot;vet&quot;, &quot;shin&quot;/&quot;sin&quot;). The letters &quot;, &quot;, &quot;&quot;, each modified with a Geresh, represent the consonants , , . The consonant may also be written as &quot;תש&quot; and &quot;טש&quot;. is represented interchangeably by a simple vav &quot;ו&quot;, non-standard double vav &quot;וו&quot; and sometimes by non-standard geresh modified vav &quot;ו׳&quot;.

== Phonology ==

Modern Hebrew has fewer phonemes than Biblical Hebrew but it has developed its own phonological complexity. Israeli Hebrew has 25 to 27 consonants, depending on whether the speaker has pharyngeals. It has 5 to 10 vowels, depending on whether diphthongs and vowels are counted, varying with the speaker and the analysis.

== Morphology ==
Modern Hebrew morphology (formation, structure, and interrelationship of words in a language) is essentially Biblical. Modern Hebrew showcases much of the inflectional morphology of the classical upon which it was based. In the formation of new words, all verbs and the majority of nouns and adjectives are formed by the classically Semitic devices of triconsonantal roots (&quot;shoresh&quot;) with affixed patterns (&quot;mishkal&quot;). Mishnaic attributive patterns are often used to create nouns, and Classical patterns are often used to create adjectives. Blended words are created by merging two bound stems or parts of words.

== Syntax ==

The syntax of Modern Hebrew is mainly Mishnaic but also shows the influence of different contact languages to which its speakers have been exposed during the revival period and over the past century.

=== Word order ===
The word order of Modern Hebrew is predominately SVO (subject–verb–object). Biblical Hebrew was originally verb–subject–object (VSO), but drifted into SVO. In the modern language, a sentence may correctly be arranged in any order but its meaning might be hard to understand unless אֶת is used. Modern Hebrew maintains classical syntactic properties associated with VSO languages: it is prepositional, rather than postpositional, in marking case and adverbial relations, auxiliary verbs precede main verbs; main verbs precede their complements, and noun modifiers (adjectives, determiners other than the definite article (), and noun adjuncts) follow the head noun; and in genitive constructions, the possessee noun precedes the possessor. Moreover, Modern Hebrew allows and sometimes requires sentences with a predicate initial.

== Lexicon ==
Modern Hebrew has expanded its vocabulary effectively to meet the needs of casual vernacular, of science and technology, of journalism and belles-lettres. According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann:

=== Loanwords ===
Modern Hebrew has loanwords from Arabic (both from the local Palestinian dialect and from the dialects of Jewish immigrants from Arab countries), Aramaic, Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish, German, Polish, Russian, English and other languages. Simultaneously, Israeli Hebrew makes use of words that were originally loanwords from the languages of surrounding nations from ancient times: Canaanite languages as well as Akkadian. Mishnaic Hebrew borrowed many nouns from Aramaic (including Persian words borrowed by Aramaic), as well as from Greek and to a lesser extent Latin. In the Middle Ages, Hebrew made heavy semantic borrowing from Arabic, especially in the fields of science and philosophy. Here are typical examples of Hebrew loanwords:

<doc id="554354" wikidata="Q4122579" url="?curid=554354" title="Arikara War">
<text>The Arikara War was a military conflict between the United States and Arikara in 1823 fought in the Great Plains along the Upper Missouri River in the Unorganized Territory (presently within South Dakota). For the United States, the war was the first in which the United States Army was deployed for operations west of the Missouri River on the Great Plains. The war, the first and only conflict between the Arikara and the U.S., came as a response to an Arikara attack on U.S. citizens engaged in the fur trade. The Arikara War was called &quot;the worst disaster in the history of the Western fur trade&quot;.

==Background==
Relations between the United States and the Arikara commenced in 1804. Initially, the relations were amicable. In 1806, Ankedoucharo, an Arikara leader, died during a trip to the United States capital. Although the U.S. claimed that his death was from natural causes, the Arikara widely believed that Ankedoucharo was deliberately murdered by U.S. citizens. In subsequent years, contact between the Arikara and White Americans increased as a result of the growing activity of corporations engaged in the international fur trade. In early 1823, the Arikara attacked a corporate fort belonging to the Missouri Fur Company, killing two U.S. citizens.

The Arikara had poor relations with the Western Dakota and Lakota Sioux, two stronger Indigenous nations along its borders. The Arikara involved in the war were living in two communities on the west shore of the Missouri River located approximately six miles upstream from the mouth of Grand River, and a small creek separated the two fortified communities of Arikara homes.

The causes of the war are not well recorded, but the trading relationship of the Arikara with white traders was certainly a factor. The Arikara lived in permanent settlements for most of the year where they farmed, fished and hunted buffalo on the surrounding plains. However, this was insufficient to sustain them and they relied on being a center of trade with neighboring tribes to survive. William Henry Ashley&#x27;s expedition to directly acquire furs and pelts cut out the Arikara in their role as trading middle-men and was thus a direct threat to their livelihood. There was also the issue of their desire to have a trading post on their territory so that they could have easy access to manufactured goods. They resented the fact that their long-time enemies, the Sioux, had such posts, but they did not. Ashley had been asked to set up a trading post when he was in the area in 1822. Not wishing to limit his operations by having to maintain a permanent base, Ashley instead promised the Arikara that he would have the goods they asked for shipped to them directly from St. Louis. Ashley had not made good this promise at the time of his 1823 expedition, and possibly never intended to. The death of Ankedoucharo was probably not a direct cause of the war, but it did add to the general resentment.

==The assault and the Arikara War (1823)==
On 2 June 1823, Arikara warriors assaulted trappers working for Ashley&#x27;s Rocky Mountain Fur Company on the Missouri River, killing about 15 people. The surviving trappers retreated down the river and hid in shelters, where they stayed for more than a month.

The United States responded with a combined force of 230 soldiers of the 6th Infantry, 750 Sioux allies, and 50 trappers and other company employees under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth, Fort Atkinson, present-day Nebraska: &quot;The forces thus organized, including regular troops, mountaineers, voyageurs and Indians, were styled the Missouri Legion.&quot;

The 750 warriors were part Yankton and Yanktonai Sioux, part western Sioux from the Brule, the Blackfeet, and the Hunkpapa divisions. The Lakotas &quot;... appeared anxious to join us&quot;. The Indian force received promises of Arikara horses and spoils, and with the enemy&#x27;s villages fallen new ranges would open for the Sioux.

On 9 August 1823, Leavenworth arrived at the Arikara villages and commenced the attack using his Sioux cavalry, but this was held off by the Arikara. On 10 August, Leavenworth ordered an artillery bombardment. This was largely ineffective, the shots falling beyond the villages, at which point Leavenworth ordered an infantry attack. Like the Sioux auxiliaries, the regular infantry also failed to break into the villages. They left the battlefield with some captured horses and laden with corn taken from the farming Indians&#x27; fields.

On 11 August 1823, Leavenworth negotiated a peace treaty: &quot;In making this treaty, I met with every possible difficulty which it was in the power of the Missouri Fur Company to throw in my way.&quot;

Fearing further attacks, the Arikara left the village that night. Leavenworth set off to return to Fort Atkinson on 15 August. The Arikara village was burned behind him by resentful members of the Missouri Fur Company, much to Leavenworth&#x27;s anger.

The US Army suffered the first casualties in the West during the Arikara War. Seven people drowned in the Missouri.

==Aftermath==

The Arikara refugees returned the following spring, restoring the villages. After the destruction of the Arikara village on 2 June, some Americans angrily accused the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company of stirring up the Arikara against the American trappers in order to profit from their reduced involvement in the fur trade thanks to the war. Representatives for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company denied this, pointing out they had never had any trappers contracted by them working in the region.

The hostility between the United States and the Arikara ended officially on 18 July 1825, when the two opponents signed a peace treaty. The U.S. Army and the Arikara never engaged in battle again.

As for the Sioux, &quot;the result of the [Leavenworth] expedition ruined the reputation of all whites in the eyes of the Indians&quot;. The Sioux continued to attack the Arikaras and press them north, from one village to another. In 1851, the western Sioux claimed the 1823 battleground as Lakota territory and later received formal treaty recognition on the former Arikara land.

Although brief, the conflict was noted for two reasons: it was the first military conflict between the United States and Native Americans in the West, setting the tone for future encounters between whites and other Native American groups; and since Leavenworth did not completely defeat the Arikara, his leniency toward them sparked a great debate between white Americans demanding subjugation of the natives and those advocating for peaceful cohabitation.

The Arikara eventually settled with the Mandan and Hidatsa on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. Many Arikara and Crow people became Indian scouts during the height of the Sioux Wars.

Archaeological work at the location of the Arikara villages (Leavenworth site (39CO9)) in 1932 gave a clue to the futile shelling of the earth lodges more than 100 years earlier. The upper stratums of earth hid a number of unexploded shells.

== In the media ==
A fictionalized representation of the 1823 attack by the Arikara on the Rocky Mountain Fur Company appears in the 2015 film &quot;The Revenant&quot; from the perspective of trapper Hugh Glass.

<text>The Volkswagen Passat is a nameplate of large family cars (D-segment) manufactured and marketed by the German automobile manufacturer Volkswagen since 1973 and also marketed variously as the Dasher, Santana, Quantum, Magotan, Corsar and Carat — in saloon, estate, and hatchback body styles.

A &quot;four-door coupé&quot; variant of the Passat with a lower roof was released in the North American market in 2008 as the Passat CC, which was then renamed to Volkswagen CC. The CC was succeeded by the Arteon in 2017.

In January 2011, Volkswagen introduced a separate Passat model line, internally designated &quot;Volkswagen New Midsize Sedan&quot; or NMS, that was manufactured in the US at the Chattanooga assembly plant and in China at Nanjing by SAIC-Volkswagen. Developed to increase Volkswagen sales in North America, the Passat NMS is larger and costs less to produce, and is sold in the North America, South Korea, China, and Middle East. The separate B8 Passat model entered production in Europe in 2014, based on the MQB platform.

In 2019, the Passat NMS program was split into two as the North American one continued being produced on an older platform while the Chinese Passat moved on to the MQB platform, which resulted in Volkswagen marketed three models under the Passat nameplate globally at that time. The North American Passat was discontinued after the 2022 model year.

Volkswagen ended the production of the saloon Passat for the European market in 2022. The B9 Passat, released in 2023, is only available in an estate body style. The Passat continues to be available as a saloon in China.

The &quot;Passat&quot; is one of several Volkswagen models named after a wind: &quot;Passat&quot; is the usual German word for &quot;Trade winds&quot;.

== B1 (&quot;Typ&quot; 32; 1973) ==

The first generation Passat launched in 1973 in two- and four-door sedan and three- and five-door versions. Externally all four shared styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro. The first generation Passat was a fastback variant of the mechanically identical Audi 80 sedan, introduced a year earlier. A five-door station wagon was introduced in 1974, which in North American markets was sold as an Audi Fox. In Europe, the Passat was equipped with two rectangular, two round 7-inch, or four round 5.5-inch headlights depending on specification. The Passat was one of the most modern European family cars at the time, and was intended as a replacement for the ageing Volkswagen Type 3 and Type 4. The only other European cars of its size to feature front-wheel drive and a hatchback were the Renault 16 and Austin Maxi.

The Passat originally featured the four-cylinder OHC 1.3-litre () and 1.5-litre (/) petrol engines also used in the Audi 80—longitudinally mounted with front-wheel drive, in Audi tradition, with either a four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic. It had a MacPherson strut front suspension with a solid axle/coil spring setup at the rear.

The SOHC 1.5-litre was enlarged to 1.6-litre in August 1975 with unchanged power ratings and slightly higher torque ratings. In July 1978, the Passat Diesel became available, equipped with the VW Golf&#x27;s 1.5-litre diesel (), followed in February 1979 by the Passat GLI with a fuel-injected version of the 1.6-litre engine.

The range received a facelift in 1977 (launched 1978 outside Europe) with revised interior and revised exterior with repositioned indicators and depending on model, either four round or two rectangular headlights.

In North America, the car was marketed as the Volkswagen Dasher. The three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and a station wagon model launched in North America for and during the 1974 model year. Sole available engine was a carburetted 1.5-litre inline-four developing (or in 1975), supplanted from model year 1976 by a Bosch fuel-injected 1.6-litre four . North American cars were equipped with single DOT standard headlights.

In 1978, the Dasher received a facelift along the lines of the European Passat, with quad sealed beam headlights and big polyurethane covered bumpers. The trim was also upgraded and the ride softened. 1979 saw the introduction of the 1.5-litre diesel engine, which produced just in the car. 0–100 km/h time for the Diesel was 19.4 seconds, 6.2 seconds slower than the petrol (petrol) engine. All petrol engines were dropped for North America in 1981, in preparation for the next generation.

In Brazil, the Passat B1 was produced from June 1974 until 1988. Since the Audi 80 was not marketed in Brazil, the Passat received the Audi&#x27;s different front-end treatment after a facelift for 1979. Originally with a 1.5-litre engine, during its long life cycle many improvements from the B2 platform were later introduced, like its 1.6 and 1.8-litre engines, a Brazil-specific face-lift in 1985, and a five-speed gearbox. A sports version, named Passat TS 1.6 and later Passat GTS 1.8 Pointer was also introduced.


== B2 (&quot;Typ&quot; 32B; 1981) ==


The second generation Passat launched in November 1980. The platform, named B2, was once again based on the corresponding version of the Audi 80, which had been launched in 1978. The B2 Passat was slightly longer.

In addition to the Passat hatchbacks and Variants (estate/wagon), there was also a conventional three-box saloon, which until the 1985 facelift was sold as the Volkswagen Santana in Europe. In the United States, the Passat/Santana was sold as the Volkswagen Quantum, available in three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and a wagon model, but the five-door hatchback was never sold there and the three-door hatchback was dropped after less than two years. The four-wheel drive Syncro wagon version was introduced in October 1984, initially only with the more powerful five-cylinder engine.

The Passat/Santana was also produced and commercialized in China, Mexico, South America and South Africa, too. In Mexico, it was marketed from 1984 to 1988 as VW Corsar and Corsar Variant (the 4-door saloon and 5-door wagon, respectively). In Argentina, from 1987 to 1991 as the VW Carat. In Brazil, the wagon model was badged VW Quantum. The Passat saloon and estate were produced in South Africa for the local market until 1987.

Like the previous generation, the B2 Passat was mainly sold with four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. Unlike its predecessor, the top-of the line versions received five-cylinder Audi or VW engines of 1.9–2.2 litres. In addition to four- and five-speed manuals and three-speed automatic gearboxes, the Passat/Santana was also available with the 4+E transmission. This, also called the &quot;Formel E&quot; had a particularly long top gear, which combined with a freewheeling mechanism, provided better gas mileage. An automatic stop/start was also available in some markets. The four-wheel-drive system used in the Passat Variant Syncro shared the mechanics of the Audi 80 and not the Volkswagen Golf Syncro. The Syncro&#x27;s bottom plate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex rear axle assembly). Only the more popular estate was reengineered.

In 1985, the range received a slight facelift, consisting of new, larger bumpers, interior retouches, a new front grille and new taillights on the hatchback versions. The three-door hatchback was discontinued, while the Santana nameplate was dropped in Europe. The saloon&#x27;s front end was now the same as the hatchback and estate.

On 31 March 1988, production ended (although Syncro models continued in production until June) with 3,345,248 built in Germany. World production totaled approximately 4.5 million units.


== B3 and B4 (&quot;Typ&quot; 35i; 1988) ==

The third generation Passat was introduced in March 1988 in Europe, 1990 in North America, and 1995 in South America. The lack of a grille made the car&#x27;s front end styling reminiscent of older, rear-engined Volkswagens, such as the 411, and also doubled as a modern styling trend. The styling was developed from the 1981 aerodynamic (cd 0.25) Auto 2000 concept car.

At the time, it was the first transverse engine layout Passat to be built on a Volkswagen-designed platform, rather than sharing one with an Audi saloon. The car, although designated B3 in Volkswagen&#x27;s platform nomenclature, was based largely on the A platform as used for the smaller Golf model, but was stretched in all directions, and therefore had no connection with the B3 series Audi 80, launched two years earlier. Many components are shared directly between these vehicles. This generation of Passat was sold as a four-door saloon or a five-door estate, with the Passat not being sold as a hatchback from this point onwards. It was marketed under the Passat name in all markets; in North America, this was a first.

The fuel-injected petrol engines gave better performance and refinement than the carburettor units previously used. They were mounted transversely, and the floorpan was engineered to accept Volkswagen&#x27;s &#x27;Syncro&#x27; four-wheel drive system. Engine options were the 2.0-litre 16-valve engine in the GL model, 1.8-litre engine in the CL model (not available in North America, all CLs, GLs, and GLSs had the 2.0 16v), The 1.8 8v 112 bhp PB engine from the Golf GTi was also used in the Passat GT model. Volkswagen&#x27;s new 2.8-litre VR6 engine (also used in the Golf and Corrado) in the GLX/GLS model (introduced in 1991 in Europe and 1992 in North America), and the G60 engine (only available on the Syncro model in Canada for the North American market). The VR6 engine gave the top-of-the-range Passat a top speed of . The 1.9-litre and the 1.6-litre diesel engine were also available as options.


=== 1993 facelift (Passat B4) ===

The B3 Passat was heavily facelifted in 1993, and despite being designated B4, it was not an all-new model. The facelift revised external body panels except for the roof and glasshouse, with most obvious exterior change seeing the reintroduction of a grille to match the style of the other same-generation Volkswagen models of the era, such as the Mk3 Golf and Jetta. The interior was mildly updated and included safety equipment, such as dual front airbags and seat belt pretensioners, although the basic dashboard design remained unchanged. The grille was introduced to give the front end a more aggressive appearance, as the previous model looked too &#x27;passive&#x27;.

The car was available with a Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine – an inline four-cylinder 1.9-litre turbodiesel, generating at 3,750 rpm and of torque at 1,900 rpm. It carried a US EPA fuel efficiency rating for the sedan of highway. Combined with a reserve option fuel tank, the B4 TDI wagon had an 1800+ km (1200+ mi) range on a single tank of fuel. The B4 TDI wagon saw less than 1,000 sales in the US during its 1996 to 1997 lifespan.


== B5 (&quot;Typ&quot; 3B, 1996) and B5.5 (3BG; 2001) ==

An all-new Passat, based on the Volkswagen Group B5 platform, was first launched in Germany in 1996 and later on in February 1997 in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom, and 1998 in North America as well as Australia. Its PL45 platform was shared with the first-generation &quot;Typ 8D&quot; Audi A4, which was unveiled two years earlier, and saw a return to the Passat sharing its longitudinal engine layout platform with Audi&#x27;s equivalent model for the first time since the second-generation (B2) Passat of 1981, which shared its platform with the second-generation &quot;Typ 81&quot; Audi 80/Audi 90 (the A4 is the successor to the Audi 80 line).

The Passat introduced a new design language, first seen on the Concept 1 concept car, for the latest generation of Volkswagens, such as the Mk4 Golf, Bora and Polo Mk4. Aerodynamic work gave the B5 Passat a coefficient of drag of 0.27 (saloon model).

The car featured a fully independent four-link front suspension; and a semi-independent torsion beam for front-wheel-drive models or a fully independent suspension on the 4motion 4WD models. 4WD was introduced in 1997 as an option for the 1.8-litre, 2.8-litre V6, 1.9-litre TDI, 2.0-litre TDI and 2.5-litre V6 TDI engines, using a second-generation Torsen T-2 based 4WD system to minimise loss of traction. The 1.8-litre petrol engine in the Passat and Audi A4 has a lower oil capacity than transverse applications of the same engine ( in transverse, longitudinal), and may suffer from oil sludge problems as a result, if not changed at regular intervals with fully synthetic oils. Four transmission options were available: a 5-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed manual transmission (codename 01E), a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 5-speed automatic transmission with tiptronic.

The 1.6-litre petrol engine had been dropped by 1999, leaving the 1.8-litre 20-valve as the entry-level engine.


=== 2001 facelift (Passat B5.5 – &quot;Typ&quot; 3BG) ===
The B5.5 Passat began production in late 2000, with styling and mechanical revisions, including revised projector-optic headlights, bumpers, tail lights, and chrome trim.

A 4.0-litre W8 engine producing was introduced in 2001 in a luxury version of the car that included standard 4motion all-wheel drive. This engine was intended to be a test bed for Volkswagen Group&#x27;s new W engine technology, which would later make an appearance on the W12 in the Phaeton, Audi A8, and Bentley Continental GT, and the W16 engine in the Bugatti Veyron. The engine was discontinued in 2004.

== B6 (&quot;Typ&quot; 3C; 2005) and B7 (2010) ==

The B6 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005, and launched in Europe in the summer of 2005 for the 2006 model year. Unlike its predecessor, the B6 Passat no longer shared its platform with Audi&#x27;s equivalent model (the Audi A4). Based on a modified version of the Mk5 Golf&#x27;s PQ35 platform (PQ46), the B6 featured a transverse rather than longitudinal engine layout of its predecessor, like the previous B3 and B4 generations, which were related to the A2 (Golf) platform. The PQ46 platform provided increased torsional rigidity.

At the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2007, Volkswagen launched the &#x27;R Line&#x27; R36, created by Volkswagen Individual GmbH, which is uses a 3.6 litre VR6 engine rated and of torque.

=== Passat CC ===

The CC (&quot;Comfort Coupé&quot;) is a 4-door coupé version of the Passat. It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Originally aimed at competing with the similarly styled Mercedes CLS, the Passat CC intends to be more stylish and luxurious than the previously released Passat B6. In the US, the name Passat was dropped, and the car was being sold as just CC. 

Volkswagen facelifted the Passat CC in late 2011 for the 2012 year, with styling updates akin to those of the larger Phaeton. For the updated model, Volkswagen has dropped the Passat name for all markets, now matching the Volkswagen CC branding used since 2008 in North America.

=== 2010 facelift (Passat B7) ===

The B6 Passat was facelifted by Klaus Bischoff and Walter de Silva and was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in September 2010. Although designated &quot;B7&quot; by VW enthusiasts, the car is not an all-new model. The facelift resulted in new external body panels except for the roof and glasshouse, with the prominent changes to the grille and headlights, and minor changes to the interior. Overall height and width dimensions are unchanged from the B6 Passat, while length was increased by 4 mm. 

=== Passat Alltrack ===
In October 2010, Volkswagen presented at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show the Passat Alltrack. The Passat Alltrack bridges the gap between the passenger VW range and the SUV range comprising the Tiguan and Touareg. The Passat Alltrack was aimed at competing with Subaru Outback, which created a new market niche, both the Alltrack and Outback both bear resemblance in ride height and external body kit.


== B8 (&quot;Typ&quot; 3G; 2015) ==

The eighth generation model of the Passat was unveiled on 3 July 2014, with sales commenced in November 2014 in Continental Europe and in January 2015 in the United Kingdom as a four-door saloon and estate. Following other Volkswagen Group passenger vehicles such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk7, it is based on a MQB platform, a modular automobile construction platform designed for transverse, front-engined cars. 

The Passat B8 continued to be sold in China under the name Magotan; this version has an 80 mm longer wheelbase.
==B9 (&quot;Typ&quot; 3J; 2023)==
The ninth-generation Passat is available strictly as an estate except for China, where it is also available as a saloon. It was unveiled on 31 August 2023 and made its official debut at the 2023 Munich Motor Show, it is based on the revised version of the MQB Evo platform and is assembled in Slovakia instead of Germany alongside the Škoda Superb that it is based on.

The Magotan sedan was unveiled on 25 April 2024 at the 2024 Beijing Auto Show, being based on the same platform as the B9 Passat estate sold globally.

The Passat Pro based on the same platform as the B9 Magotan, developed from the SAIC Volkswagen joint venture exclusively for the Chinese market and released in September 2024. Compared to the Magotan, the Passat Pro features a different front fascia that is borrowed from the Passat Estate and is shorter in length.

== Other versions ==
=== Passat Lingyu (China, 2005–2011) ===

The Passat Lingyu is a restyled version of the first generation Škoda Superb for the Chinese market. Manufactured by SAIC Volkswagen, the Passat Lingyu was introduced in 2005, succeeding the Passat B5. The car was designed by Istanbul-born car designer Murat Günak. In 2009, a facelifted version was introduced as the Passat New Lingyu (Xinlingyu). Production lasted until 2011 and replaced by the Passat NMS.

Volkswagen built 20 examples of a fuel-cell Passat Lingyu in mid-2008 to be presented at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

=== Passat NMS (North America and China, 2011–present) ===
The Passat branched into two models starting from 2011: one marketed in Europe, right-hand drive markets, and in China as the Magotan, and the other known as the Passat NMS that is manufactured for the North American and Chinese market. The NMS is more downscale compared to the European Passat to achieve a lower price point and penetrate the mainstream mid-size sedan market. The Passat NMS model was split again in 2019 as the Chinese version moved on to the MQB platform, while the North American model continued to use its same platform.

Known as the New Midsize Sedan (NMS) before its unveiling in January 2011, this model was designed for the North American market, replacing the B6 Passat sedan and wagon. At its introduction, the Passat NMS was part of Volkswagen Group&#x27;s strategy to sell over 800,000 vehicles per year in the North American market. The Passat NMS is marketed in the North America, South Korea, Middle East, and China, with no plans for a wagon/estate version. North American, Middle Eastern and South Korean models are manufactured at its Chattanooga Assembly Plant.

In China, the new model is built by SAIC-Volkswagen in its Nanjing factory and is marketed as a more upscale model with some interior and exterior differences to the North American model, such as wood-trimmed steering wheel, rear air vents, and LED accented headlights. It was sold alongside models such as the long-wheelbase version of the European Passat known as the Magotan and a B5 Passat-based Passat Lingyu.
==== Facelift (North America, 2019) ====
A revised Passat for the North American market was released in 2019 as a 2020 model. The 2020 Volkswagen Passat NMS featured revised styling and added standard safety and technology features, which include a suite of standard driver assistance technologies and a 6.33-inch glass-covered touchscreen infotainment system with next-generation VW CarNet 4G LTE in-vehicle telematics. The 2019 features a carryover 174-horsepower, 2.0-litre TSI I4 petrol engine and six-speed automatic transmission. Following the 2022 model year, Volkswagen discontinued the Passat in North America due to slow sales.
===Magotan (China, 2005–present)===

In China, the European version Passat is sold as the VW Magotan from the B6 generation, produced by FAW-Volkswagen. The previous model, sold since 2024 is based on the B9 version of the European Passat.
===Passat (China, 2011–present) ===
The Passat nameplate was first used in China in 2011, when SAIC Volkswagen began selling the North-American Passat NMS.

In October 2018, the Chinese market 2019 Passat was unveiled, using the same Volkswagen Group MQB platform as the European Passat and VW Magotan, but is not directly based on them. As a result, despite the high physical resemblance between the Chinese and North American Passats (and both being called Passat NMS), they have now diverged and are no longer using the same platform. The Volkswagen Magotan (China) produced by FAW-VW and Volkswagen Passat NMS (China) produced by SAIC-VW are considered to be near-equivalents, using the same MQB platform and an identical wheelbase of 2871mm, but with slightly different dimensions and different styling. The latest generation based on the B9 version of the European Passat will be launched in 2024.

Trim levels are known as the 280TSI, 330TSI and 380TSI. 280TSI models receive the 1.4-litre EA211 engine, while 330TSI and 380TSI models receive the 2.0-litre EA888 engine. All models are available with 7-speed DSG gearbox as standard.

<text>Edward Irving (4 August 17927 December 1834) was a Scottish clergyman, generally regarded as the main figure behind the foundation of the Catholic Apostolic Church.

==Early life==
Edward Irving was born at Annan, Annandale, the second son of Gavin Irving, a tanner, and his wife, Mary Lowther of Dornock. On his father&#x27;s side he was descended from a family long known in the district which had ties to French Huguenot refugees. His mother&#x27;s side, the Lowthers, were farmers or small proprietors in Annandale. He was first educated at a school kept by Peggy Paine, a relation of Thomas Paine, after which he entered the Annan Academy taught by Adam Hope.

==Scotland==
Aged thirteen he entered the University of Edinburgh. In 1809 he graduated M.A.; and in 1810, on the recommendation of Sir John Leslie, he was chosen master of the mathematical school, newly established at Haddington, East Lothian. Amongst his pupils there were Jane Welsh, later famous as Mrs. Carlyle, one of the great letter-writers of the nineteenth century, and Thomas Burns.

He became engaged in 1812 to Isabella Martin, but he gradually fell in love with Jane Welsh, and she with him. He tried to break off his engagement with Isabella, but was prevented by her family. It was Irving, ironically, who in 1821 had introduced Thomas Carlyle, the essayist, to her. Eventually, in 1823, he married Isabella. (Confusingly, Irving was also influential in the life of another Scottish Thomas Carlyle, born a few years later, whom he eventually gave a position of some responsibility within his new church.)

His appointment at Haddington was exchanged for a similar one at Kirkcaldy Academy in Fife, in 1812. Completing his divinity studies by a series of partial sessions, he was licensed to preach in June 1815, but continued to discharge his scholastic duties for three years. He devoted his leisure, not only to mathematical and physical science, but to a course of reading in English literature, his bias towards the antique in sentiment and style being strengthened by a perusal of the older classics, among whom Richard Hooker was his favourite author. At the same time his love of the marvellous found gratification in the wonders of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, and it is further related of him that he used to carry in his waistcoat pocket a miniature copy of &quot;Ossian&quot;, passages from which he frequently recited with sonorous elocution and vehement gesticulation.

In the summer of 1818, he resigned his mastership and to increase the probability of obtaining a permanent appointment in the Church of Scotland, took up his residence in Edinburgh. Although his exceptional method of address seems to have gained him the qualified approval of certain dignitaries of the church, the prospect of his obtaining a settled charge seemed as remote as ever. He was considering a missionary tour in Persia when he was arrested by steps taken by Thomas Chalmers which, after considerable delay, resulted in October 1819 in Irving being appointed his assistant and missionary in St John&#x27;s parish, Glasgow.

Except in the case of a select few, Irving&#x27;s preaching awakened little interest among the congregation of St John&#x27;s. Chalmers himself, with no partiality for its bravuras and flourishes, compared it to Italian music, appreciated only by connoisseurs; but as a missionary among the poorer classes he wielded a powerful influence. The benediction &quot;Peace be to this house&quot;, with which, in accordance with apostolic usage, he greeted every dwelling he entered, was not inappropriate.

==London==
This half-success in a subordinate sphere was, however, so far from coinciding with his aspirations that he had again, in the winter of 1821, begun to turn his attention towards missionary labour in the East, when he received an invitation from the Caledonian Church, Hatton Garden, London (now the Lumen Church, Bloomsbury).

Due to that charge, he was ordained in July 1822. Some years previously, he had expressed his conviction that one of the chief needs of the age was reform sinners and non-believers.

With a sudden leap into popularity, he was compared to the eloquence made in the House of Commons by George Canning, who had been induced to attend his church from admiration of an expression in one of his prayers, quoted to him by Sir James Mackintosh. &quot;His commanding stature, the symmetry of his form, the dark and melancholy beauty of his countenance, rather rendered piquant than impaired by an obliquity of vision, produced an imposing impression even before his deep and powerful voice had given utterance to its melodious thunders; and harsh and superficial half-truths enunciated with surpassing ease and grace of gesture, and not only with an air of absolute conviction but also with the authority of a prophetic messenger, in tones whose magical fascination was inspired by an earnestness beyond all imitation of art, acquired a plausibility and importance which, at least while the orator spoke, made his audience entirely forgetful of their preconceived objections against them. The subject-matter of his orations, and his peculiar treatment of his themes, no doubt also, at least at first, constituted a considerable part of his attractive influence.&quot;
He had prepared himself, as he thought, for teaching political, legal, and scientific men; he did not attempt to win them through abstract, worn-out theological arguments, but discussed the opinions, poetry, politics, manners and customs of the time. Rather than address these issues through a comprehensive philosophical approach, Irving&#x27;s method was one of severe satire varied by fierce denunciation.

A fire of criticism from pamphlets, newspapers and reviews opened on his volume of &quot;Orations&quot;, published in 1823; but the excitement produced was merely superficial and short lasting. Though having antipathy to ecclesiastical formulas, Irving&#x27;s aim was to revive the antique style of thought and sentiment which had hardened into these formulas, and to supplant the new influences, the accidental and temporary moral shortcomings.

Being at variance with the thought of his time, the failure of his task was inevitable; and shortly after the opening of his new church in Regent Square in 1827, he found that his style was out of fashion and the church, though always well filled, was no longer crowded. By this desertion and in his despair, his tendency towards supernaturalism increased.

==Forerunner of the Catholic Apostolic Church==
For years, the subject of prophecy had occupied much of Irving&#x27;s thoughts, and his belief in the near approach of the second coming of Christ had received such positive corroboration by the work of a Jesuit priest, Manuel Lacunza, writing under the assumed Jewish name of &quot;Juan Josafat Ben-Ezra&quot;, that in 1827, he published a translation of it. Probably the religious opinions of Irving, originally in some respects more catholic than protestant, had gained breadth and comprehensiveness from Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but gradually his chief interest in Coleridge&#x27;s philosophy centred on what was mystical and obscure, and may be traced to the doctrine of millenarianism.

The first stage of his later development which resulted in the establishment of the Irvingite or Holy Catholic Apostolic Church in 1832, was associated with the Albury Conferences (1826–1830), moderated by Hugh Boyd M‘Neile (1795–1879), at his friend Henry Drummond&#x27;s seat, Albury Park at Albury, Surrey, concerning unfulfilled prophecy, followed by an almost exclusive study of the prophetical books and especially of the Apocalypse, and by several series of sermons on prophecy in London and the provinces. His apocalyptic lectures in 1828 filled the largest churches of Edinburgh, Scotland on summer mornings.

In 1830, however, he experienced a revival of gifts of prophecy and healing which he had already in 1828 persuaded himself had only been kept in abeyance by the absence of faith. He welcomed the new powers even though they caused the desertions of his dearest friends, his own descent into a subordinate position, and his rejection by the church. His excommunication by the Presbytery of London in 1830 for publishing his doctrines of the humanity of Jesus Christ, and the condemnation of these opinions by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in the following year, were secondary episodes. They affected the main issue of his career as they further isolated him from the sympathy of the church and the irregularities connected with the manifestation of the gifts gradually estranged the majority of his own congregation, and on the complaint of the trustees to the Presbytery of London, whose authority his local church had formerly rejected, he was declared unfit to remain the minister of the National Scotch Church of Regent Square.

After he and those who adhered to him (describing themselves as of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church) had in 1832 moved to a new building in Newman Street, he was, in March 1833, deposed from the ministry of the Church of Scotland by the Presbytery of Annan on the original charge of heresy.

Having been expelled from the Church of Scotland, Irving took to preaching in the open air in Islington, until a new church was built for him and his followers on Duncan Street, Islington. It was funded by Duncan Mackenzie of Barnsbury, a former elder of Irving&#x27;s London church, and built by the Holborn firm of Stevenson &amp; Ramage. It closed in the 1970s.

After some delay, he was reordained chief pastor of the church assembled in Newman Street. He died on 7 December 1834. He is buried in the crypt of Glasgow Cathedral near to the tomb of St. Mungo.

==Monument==

There is a statue of Irving in the grounds of Annan Old Parish Church in Dumfriesshire. It was sculpted by J. W. Dods of Dumfries. It was unveiled by Archibald Charteris in 1892 on the centenary of Irving&#x27;s birth.

==Family==

In October 1823, he married Isobel Martin, daughter of Rev. Dr. John Martin DD of Kirkcaldy. They had at least eight children, the first four of which died in infancy. He lived at 4 Claremont Square, Islington, London. Their surviving children included Isabella Irving (b. 1834) who married Samuel Rawson Gardiner and Martin Howy Irving, who moved to Australia.

==Bibliography==
The writings of Irving published during his lifetime were:
*&quot;For the Oracles of God, Four Orations&quot; (1823)
*&quot;For Judgment to come&quot; (1823)
*&quot;Babylon and Infidelity foredoomed – A Discourse on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse which relate to these latter times, and until the Second Advent&quot; (1826, 2nd ed. 1828)

<doc id="554366" wikidata="Q258151" url="?curid=554366" title="Henry Drummond (1786–1860)">
<text>Henry Drummond (5 December 1786 – 20 February 1860) was an English banker, politician and writer, best known as one of the founders of the Catholic Apostolic or Irvingite Church.

==Life==
He was born at The Grange, near Northington, Hampshire, the eldest son of Henry Drummond, a prominent London banker; his mother was Anne, daughter of Henry Dundas. He was educated at Harrow and at Christ Church, Oxford, but took no degree. His name is connected with the university through the chair of political economy which he founded in 1825.

He entered Parliament in 1810 as the member for Plympton Erle and took an active interest from the first in nearly all departments of politics. Though thoroughly independent and often eccentric in his views, he acted generally with the Conservative Party. His speeches were often almost inaudible but were generally lucid and informing, and on occasion caustic and severe. He was appointed Sheriff of Surrey for 1826.

In 1817, Drummond met Robert Haldane at Geneva, and continued his movement against the Socinian tendencies then prevalent in that city. In later years he was intimately associated with the origin and spread of the Catholic Apostolic Church, which Edward Irving and others had founded in 1826. The Albury Conferences, meetings moderated by Hugh Boyd M‘Neile, of those who sympathized with some of the views of Irving were held for the study of prophecy at Drummond&#x27;s seat, Albury Park, in Surrey. He contributed very liberally to the funds of the new church and he became one of its leading office-bearers, being first ordained as Angel of the Congregation in Albury and afterwards called as Apostle for Scotland and the Protestant part of Switzerland and was thus with the other &quot;Apostles&quot; and prophets responsible for its theology.

In December 1839, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society He retired in 1843 from his position as senior partner in the Charing Cross bank. From 1847 until his death, he represented West Surrey in parliament.

He died in 1860, intestate, a widower, at his main home Albury Park, leaving personal effects of under . The Administration was extracted by one of his children who on her husband&#x27;s succession became Louisa Percy, Duchess of Northumberland.

==Works==
Drummond took a deep interest in religious subjects, and published books and pamphlets on the interpretation of prophecy, the circulation of the Apocrypha and the principles of Christianity. These included apologetics on behalf of the Catholic Apostolic Church. He published a &quot;History of Noble British Families&quot; in 1846. He also published in 1851 the &quot;Principles of Ecclesiastical Buildings and Ornament&quot;, printed anonymously by Thomas Bosworth.

Hugh McNeile dedicated his book &quot;The Times of The Gentiles&quot; to Henry Drummond in 1828. In this dedication he defends Drummond against attacks which were made upon him over the topic of Drummond&#x27;s perceived novelty concerning the interpretation of Biblical prophecy.

==Family==
Drummond had married his cousin Lady Henrietta Hay-Drummond, the daughter of Robert Hay-Drummond, 10th Earl of Kinnoull. They had three sons, all of whom predeceased him, and two daughters. His daughter Louisa, Duchess of Northumberland, was the wife of the 6th Duke of Northumberland.

==Legacy==
There is a street near Melbourne in Carlton North, Victoria that has been claimed as named after him in Australia, but the local Council consider Thomas Drummond (1797–1840), the Scottish inventor, civil engineer and cartographer is the person in question.

<text>Dingiswayo () ( – 1817) (born Godongwana) was a Mthethwa king, well known for his mentorship over a young Zulu general, Shaka kaSenzangakhona, who rose to become the greatest of the Zulu Kings. His father was the Mthethwa King, Jobe kaKayi. It was under King Dingiswayo that the Mthethwa rose to prominence, mostly employing diplomacy and assimilation of nearby chiefdoms to strengthen his power base. According to Mthethwa (1995), the Mthethwas are descended from the Nguni peoples of northern Natal and the Lubombo Mountains, whose modern identity dates back some 700 years.

==Lineage==
Dingiswayo&#x27;s lineage can be traced back to Mthethwa the first. It is possible that Dingiswayo and Zwide kaLanga shared the same lineage through Xaba KaMadungu. Zwide was the king of the Ndwandwe, Khumalo, Msene, and Jele peoples. (There does not appear to be a direct family link between Zwide kaLanga and Soshangane kaZikode of the Nxumalo people).

Dingiswayo&#x27;s Mthethwa family line is stated by Muzi Mthethwa (1995) as follows:

* Dingiswayo
* Jobe
* Khayi
* Xaba
* Madungu
* Simamane and Wengwe
* Ndlovu
* Khubazi
* Nyambose
* Mthethwa

==Early life==
We first hear of Godongwana during the wanderings of Nandi and her illegitimate son Shaka, who settled with the Mthethwa under King Jobe. Godongwana and his brother, Tana, plotted against their father Jobe, but their plot was discovered. Tana was killed and Godongwana made his escape. Nursed back to health by a sister, the young man found refuge in the foothills of the Drakensberg among the Qwabe and Langeni people. He changed his name to Dingiswayo, which means &quot;one in distress or in exile&quot;.

INTRODUCTION

The AmaZulu Kingdom is one of the most prominent kingdoms in Southern Africa and that is because of the kind of leaders it has had from chiefs to kings (South African History Online 2020). The rise of the AmaZulu Kingdom had been a success because of its prominent leaders as stated above, those leaders include Chief Dingiswayo, a man that had a huge influence on the formation of the kingdom directly and indirectly. His innovative and brilliant creations which became a legacy of the kingdom contributed to AmaZulu Kingdom being regarded as of the strongest and largest kingdoms in Africa under the leadership of King Shaka kaSenzangakhona (Mthethwa, A.M. 1995). 
These contributions not only did they build the kingdom, but they were the guidance of the traditional way of life of the AmaZulu kingdom, drawing from the coronation ceremonies of the kings that had reigned after him to the way of life they had lived. Although we are living in a modern 21st century but these ways of life are still embodied and embraced by the Zulu tribe. However, when studies are being conducted about the rise of the AmaZulu kingdom little is being mentioned about Chief Dingiswayo, besides being a father figure to King Shaka hence the need for such research to be done to give a full detailed record of the impact that he had.

==King of the Mthethwas==
Upon his father&#x27;s death, he returned to Oyengweni his tribal home to claim the Kingship. He found his brother Mawewe in power. He displaced him without resistance. Mawewe fled but was lured back and killed.

Captain Goddard Edward Donovan and Dr Andrew Cowan of the 83rd Regiment who were exploring a Southern approach to the African interior and were possibly murdered by chief Phakathwayo, and Dingiswayo subsequently acquired Cowan&#x27;s horse and gun. Dingiswayo&#x27;s new military tactics were an adoption of western techniques of drills and formation movements under a chain of command.

With Shaka as his general, he attacked the Amangwane under Matiwane in about 1812 and drove them across the Buffalo river. It was the first of the &quot;Mfecane&quot; migrations – tribes displaced, latterly by the Zulus, and who in turn displaced others in a series of internecine wars.

Dingiswayo combined several smaller tribes to oppose his chief rival to the north, Chief Zwide of the Ndwandwe.

==Death and legacy==
In 1816 Shaka returned to the Zulu to claim chieftainship, while still recognising the larger Mthethwa and Dingiswayo as overlords. However, in the course of an attempted invasion of Zwide&#x27;s territory, Dingiswayo was captured and beheaded by Zwide at Ngome, near Nongoma. His possessions were buried in his kraal. Dingiswayo&#x27;s grave is on the north bank of the Tugela River, in KheKheKhe&#x27;s kraal. The Mthethwa forces were defeated and scattered temporarily, with the remnants reforming under Shaka. Zwide was later defeated by Shaka in the Zulu Civil War.

Dingiswayo&#x27;s career marked a watershed in the history of south-east Africa. During his exile, he was exposed to European ideas and he put these into practice to produce a disciplined and highly organised army for the first time in the region. After his death, Shaka extended these ideas to create a rigidly disciplined society to complement Dingiswayo&#x27;s military reforms.

===Origins and transformation.===

The study by Argely J. (1977) examined the origins of the prominent men in the history of the AmaZulu kingdom, both Dingiswayo and Shaka. However, for the benefit of this study, it is used to look into Chief Dingiswayo who according to Annon (2019) it is the “Paramount Chief of the Mthethwa”, he was not only the leader of his people but he was a leader of various northern Nguni tribe and this was before the rise of King Shaka and also it was before the start of Mfecane which resulted in a large number of migrations taking place. 
The man in question was born in the year 1770 (month and date are unknown) and he was given the name Godongwana which he later changed because of family politics which led to him having to flee away from his home and be in exile for quite a while. Him being in exile was caused by the fear of being killed by his father Chief Jobe because of speculations that have been spread by his half-brother Mawewe (whom he later sent into exile). The speculation was that Dingiswayo (Godongwana) and his brothers wanted to overthrow the chief from his throne because they believed he was way too old for him to lead reasonably and Jobe took offense at this and regarded it as “ukuvukela umbuso” which translates to treason because he wanted to turn against the chief (Koopman, A. 1979). While in exile Dingiswayo got himself under the protection of the Hlubi under Chief, that is where he changed his name to Dingiswayo which means the exile one. 
This experience of being exiled one can argue that it is because of its stress, pressure, and anger that molded his transformation, while others can say passion and love for his nation is what urged him. However, both these theories make sense as evidence has made it evident that he saw himself as the leader of the Mthethwa long before it was his time to be one. Chief Makhasana of the Mabhuda with his lessons on trade, development, and economic gain provided him with all the skills he needed to transform himself.

===Role in state formation and Military innovations.=== 
The rise of the AmaZulu Kingdom within a short period is one remarkable achievement that cannot be left ignored, especially for the Ngoni people. Chanaiwa, D.S. (1980) refers to the state formation as a “revolution”, he states that it was a violent encounter that overthrew the normal or rather “used to” traditional political system and made a remarkable transformative social order. This revolution was done through the reign of five leaders namely: Chief Dingiswayo (c. 1800-1818), Dingiswayo is regarded as the foundation layer of this revolution as mentioned above, he played a crucial role in what was then the Zululand with different started clan. His shoes were filled by the well-endowed King Shaka kaSenzangakhona (1816-1828) who formed the AmaZulu Kingdom, continued with the revolution and most importantly he was the leader who led throughout the peak of the revolution. The legacy left by both Dingiswayo and Shaka was then continued by King Dingane (1828-1840) a brother of King Shaka and the first AmaZulu king to have an encounter with the European encroachment on the Zululand, he was then succeeded by his younger brother King Mpande (1840-1872), he did not only encounter the Boers or the British but he was their vassal and this is what King Cetshwayo (1872-1884) was not in agreement with, as a result, this led to him being killed while he was fighting against British colonisation (Chanaiwa, D.S. 1980: 1-4). This revolution in question was caused by many factors which included innovation, the indigenous process of state formation, crisis resolution, and value orientation.

===Value orientation.===
In the value orientation, sub-topic/section cattle were the key role players as they were used to determine the status and wealth of a man (household), and they were also used as a medium of exchange. The favourite cattle would be given a name, it would be trained to be able to identify its owner&#x27;s voice and have poems made to give praise to it. This act symbolised the value that these cattle had on their owners. However, this cause had consequences, this culture of complex cattle culture made the AmaZulu society profound of their society and it created it not to be a pastoralist capitalist conducive mode but rather a society that is characterised by private ownership opportunities. This was made evident by the headers (heads of the family) because they would have a place built in the center of the household, where all the ancestral practices would be performed (which are still being practiced even to date) and burials. The imbalance and inequality that were faced by the cattle less commoners are what drove this theme/ practice (value orientation) to be part of the revolution (state formation). In this way this approach by Dingiswayo was trying to do away with cattle private ownership and replace it with agrarian conquerors which meant that the commoners with no cattle were rewarded for their contribution to their clans either for bureaucratic elite, attracting new subjects or for value and loyalty. This practice was done to give them a sense of value and dignity (Chanaiwa, D.S. 1980 p. 5-9). 

===Indigenous state formation process.===
Etherington, N. (2005) argues that the Mthethwa kingdom served as the home to several smaller chiefdoms of which in the later 18th century it was the AmaZulu Kingdom, and it dominated the areas from the Umkhomazi River which is in the south of the Hluhluwe in the north (Etherington, N. 2005). Chief Dingiswayo’s leadership was the period that the Mthethwa kingdom rose to power, it was influenced by the economic strength it got from trading in the Delagoa Bay. It used this influence to its advantage by exploiting the coastal lowlands and its resources (Valieva, E. 2016). 
One would argue that Chief Dingiswayo was a man who thought outside the box because his way of building an indigenous state was not the usual methods at that time, war and force were regarded as the normal way. However, Chief Dingiswayo employed a different process. Firstly, for him to get the Sokhulu chiefdom under his kingdom, he appointed Nqoboko kaLanga to be the chief of the Sokhulu, this meant that Nqoboko had to remain loyal and reliant to the Mthethwa in a way that his father was not. Moreover, they had to frequently report to Oyengweni (the capital of Chief Dingiswayo), and also Nqoboko was required to assist with expanding the area of the Mthethwa hegemony and proceed with the consolidation process around Nzimelani in the north and other neighbouring areas. This meant that they had to do away with their ruling lineage. Secondly, when Chief Senzangakhona of the Zulu Chiefdom sadly passed away after a short illness, Chief Dingiswayo then promoted or rather pushed Shaka to fight for his rightful inheritance because according to the royal customs of isihlalo Shaka as the firstborn was the heir (Argyle, J. 1977). However, from the occurrence of events, it is evident that the reason behind Dingiswayo supporting Shaka was for the benefit of his nation (the Mthethwa kingdom). He wanted to make sure that the Mthethwa ruling lineage was well represented in the Zulu royal court, hence why he firstly, groomed and mentored Shaka to be the kind of a leader he wanted him to be through the role of being induna yezicwe. Secondly, he appointed Ngomane kaNqomboli (whose role has been discussed above) to be his father and advisor and lastly, he sent one of his wife’s Gudayi and other agents to be under Shaka’s chiefdom who at a later stage became a kingdom (Nxumalo, S. 2024:15-17). 
Through his military innovations and skills, Shaka was able to reform the Zulu army, making it fit enough to fight battles for the benefit of the Mthethwa king (Dingiswayo), this was a successful plan for Dingiswayo because he had managed to still keep Shaka useful to his benefit, hence why (Annon 2017) uses these choices of words “while Shaka Zulu became the new king of the Zulu kingdom, he remained the vessel of Dingiswayo”. These Divide and conquer attacks started in ca. 1817, when Shaka attacked Mbatha’s palace while at the same time Dingiswayo attacked Ntshalini. These attacks started as a raid (raids); however, they ended up being massacred, and whoever was an obstacle in their raids was brutally removed (Gluman, M. 1940). These invasions continued with eLangeni (the Mhlongo palace) under Njomane, followed by a section of Mtungwa and Shenge together with Qungubeni palaces being attacked (Nxumalo, S. 2024:17). Men and women of the invaded palaces were taken to be under Shaka with men being incorporated in the military while women were placed in ezigodlweni (royal huts). However, with the eLangeni refugees, it was a different story because it is where Queen Nandi (Shaka’s mother) was biologically from. They were sent to the Mthethwa kingdom where they were given land for them to be able to sustain themselves. This act of giving them land was not only out of the respect he had for Queen Nandi, but it was sympathy he had, he believed in building a nation and giving land to his victims to be independent and keeping them stained, that should be applauded. 
According to Nxumalo, S. (2024:18), Shaka was given a task to further expand his invasions and attack Qodi and Ngadi until he reached Matiwane of the Ngwane, as a result, this expansion caused a drift between Dingiswayo and Ndwandwe because he was also aiming for that territory. Due to bitterness, Zwide kaNdwandwe attacked Nxumalo who happened to have had an alliance with Dingiswayo, as a result, Dingiswayo no longer regarded this as just a clash but rather a personal vendetta. In response to the attack of Zwide on Nxumalo, Dingiswayo in late 1810 set out a major attack on Ndwandwe which resulted to Dingiswayo being killed after being captured by Ndwandwe.

===Innovations===
Various innovations had transpired, and they are linked with the period of state formation where a large number of men and women had to be placed in different groups, specifically military for men. Many scholars like Chanaiwa, Thompson, and others are against some of the innovations that Dingiswayo had implemented because they believe that they were meant to weaken other chiefdoms, however, this section will outline the intentions of the innovations. 
Mthethwa, A.M. (1995) refers to the innovations that Dingiswayo had implemented in attempting to rejuvenate the kingdom as “theory put into practice” because while in exile Dingiswayo came across several re-establishing approaches that had a positive impact on him. These approaches pushed him to fulfill the vision he had about Oyengweni. The first task he gave himself, was to redefine the Mthethwa military army, he intended to blend education and military, and this approach was inspired by the whites he was trading within Delagoa Bay. Moreover, the fact that the already existing army was constantly faced with problems which were a result of the inner division caused by greed and power hunger from his brother Mawewe, this gave him sleepless nights because his army was smaller compared to the Ndwandwe army, his rival (Nxumalo, S. 2024:14). There were already existing military armies that were invented by Chief Jobe; however, their military skills and innovations were mainly focused on security and war. Jobe’s regiments were divided into three (3) categories which included Amabutho Amnyama (Black regiments); Amabutho Amhlophe (White regiments) and uYengendlovu (Elephant-baiters). Whereas Dingiswayo’s intervention or rather innovation expanded these regiments, he introduced seven (7) new military regiments. These regiments were iZichwe (Bushmen regiments) under induna (commander) uThayiza; iNyakeni (Spoon-bags) under induna Dube kaYengeni, followed by iNhlangano (Unity) under induna uNgomane kaMqomboyi, he was also made in charge of the district that is near to kwaNogqogqo where the turbulent southwestern border of the Mthethwa kingdom. They were then followed by iNingizimu (Southern regiment) which was under Mayanda kaMkhwanazi, ibutho iMini (Daylight regiment) which was under induna uNomadidi kaGugusha kaMvelase and iNyakatho military (Northern military) and lastly ibutho labeSifazane (Females military regiment) under Nohaya kaNgabha kaNsindona kaMwandla (Mthethwa, A.M. 1995:59-60). This army was the largest army that the Mthethwa kingdom has ever had, it was inclusive as it portrayed women empowerment this spoke to the aim of transformation that was addressed above that spoke about blending education with the military. It showed that Chief Dingiswayo was also in support of empowerment, inclusivity, and providing opportunities to everyone despite their gender. 
However, Chanaiwa, M. (1980) criticises this age regiments approach that Dingiswayo had applied in his kinship, he states that chiefs were the leaders of the military and war before, therefore with this new strategy, they were being undermined and made to be seen as powerless. Another issue that was raised, was doing away with the circumcision cultural practice and replacing it with military training, Dingiswayo believed that circumcision allowed his regiments to get proper training and guidance into manhood hence why he saw the need to abolish this practice. It was not beneficial for the regiments specifically Izichwe in any manner but on the other hand military training was as it equipped them and kept them stronger. 

===Social and Ethnic changes.===
Building alliances was one key that Dingiswayo used was unit and conquer, this approach Dingiswayo used through marriage as it solidified the relationship between him and the neighbours, with the Ndwandwe clan being a threat to him and his people and this method was used to prevent them from attacking unseen (Golan, D. 1990). A leader is a leader by how his or her people live, and that is what makes it more interesting about Chief Dingiswayo. He wanted to improve the lives of his people, and he did that through agriculture, trade, and social cohesion. This made him one of the wealthy chiefs in the region and inspired others to be like him including Shaka when he took over his father&#x27;s thrones (Morris, D. 1965).
Moreover, the period of Chief Dingiswayo’s leadership had drastic social changes to it, which included the expansion of the Zulu authority to the larger Zululand, and this resulted in several chiefs in the region being subordinates of Dingiswayo and later Shaka. Under the leadership of King Shaka this had negative effects as it was one of the causes of Mfecane which resulted to a number of clans and other ethnic groups migrating to the north of Africa this including the Matabele and other Zulu clans (Chanaiwa, D., 1980).

<text>Debra Janine Thomas (born March 25, 1967) is an American figure skater and physician. She is the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist, and a two-time U.S. national champion. Her rivalry with East Germany&#x27;s Katarina Witt at the 1988 Calgary Olympics was known as the Battle of the Carmens.

== Early life ==
Thomas was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, and grew up in San Jose, California. Her parents divorced when she was young. Her mother worked as a computer programming analyst in Sunnyvale, California.

== Skating career ==
Thomas started skating at age 5 in San Jose. She competed in her first figure skating competition at age 9, finishing in first place. From then on, she was hooked on competitive skating. She attributes most of her success to her mother who sacrificed to drive her over 100 miles a day between home, school, and the ice rink.

As a young child, Thomas was coached by Barbara Toigo Vitkovits at Eastridge Mall in San Jose. At age 10, Thomas was introduced to Scottish skating coach Alex McGowan. In 1983, she began to represent the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club, which launched her career. McGowan would remain her coach until she retired from amateur competition at age 21.

Thomas placed fifth in the World Championships in 1985 and won gold in 1986. The eighteen-year-old won the short program and landed four triple jumps to place second in the long program, enough to win the overall competition. Thomas had also won the U.S. national title besides the World Championship that year; these achievements earned Thomas the ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year award that year. She was the first female athlete to win those titles while attending college full-time since Tenley Albright in the 1950s. She was the first African-American to hold U.S. National titles in ladies&#x27; singles figure skating. Thomas was a pre-med student at Stanford University during this time, although it was unusual for a top U.S. skater to go to college at the same time as competing. In 1986, she received a Candace Award for Trailblazing from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women.

In 1987, Thomas suffered with Achilles tendinitis in both ankles and struggled at the U.S. Nationals, placing second to Jill Trenary. She rebounded at the World Championships, finishing a close second to East German skater Katarina Witt.

Thomas relocated to Boulder, Colorado, in the winter of 1987–88 to prepare for the Olympics. In January 1988, she reclaimed the U.S. national title. At the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary, she and Katarina Witt engaged in a rivalry that the media dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Carmens&quot;, as both women skated their long programs to the music of Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. Thomas&#x27; Carmen program consisted of &quot;big powerful jumps&quot;, fast spins in strong positions, Spanish steps that were sharply accented, an uplifted torso, and straight, clean lines as expressed in her arms and legs. According to figure skater writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, Thomas presented in her program an outer-directed focus and the image of a powerful and confident woman &quot;taking command of the space around her by moving forth into it&quot;. In Thomas&#x27; short program, she used techno dance music and wore &quot;a form-fitting skirtless unitard that showed off both her long lines and her musculature&quot;. It also included &quot;big jumps&quot;, as well as &quot;a high-energy step sequence involving angled limbs, shoulder isolations, and syncopated rhythms&quot;. Kestnabum suggests that Thomas&#x27; use of contemporary urban dance forms in her short program evoked images of her African American culture and heritage.

Thomas skated strong compulsory figures and performed well in the short program to an instrumental version of &quot;Something in My House&quot; by Dead or Alive. In her free skating program, she made mistakes on a number of jumps and placed fourth in that segment of the competition. Thomas began with a triple toe-triple toe combination, which was rare for a female skater in the 1980s. The second triple was not perfect and by her own admission, Thomas gave up on the rest of the program. Overall, she finished third and won the bronze medal, behind Witt and Canadian skater Elizabeth Manley (Thomas fell from first place going into the long program to third place overall in the final standings). By winning the bronze medal, Thomas became the first black athlete to win any medal at the Winter Olympics.

Thomas won the bronze medal at the 1988 World Championships and then retired from amateur skating. She performed for Stars on Ice and won the 1988 World Professional Championships in Landover, Maryland. She won the title again in both 1989 and 1991.

In February 1989, Thomas ranked 12th in the Q Score athlete standings, the only woman in the top 22. She was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2000. She was also selected by President George W. Bush to be part of the U.S. Delegation for the Opening Ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy along with other former Olympians: Dorothy Hamill, Eric Heiden, Kerri Strug, and Herschel Walker. Thomas returned to the ice briefly to participate in &quot;The Caesars Tribute: A Salute to the Golden Age of American Skating&quot;, an event which featured many of the greatest legends and icons of American figure skating.

Thomas returned to competition in October 2023 at the World Figure and Fancy Skating Championships in Lake Placid, New York. She placed second in the ladies figure championship and seventh in ladies fancy skating.

==Medical career==
Thomas expressed interest in becoming a doctor from an early age. She studied at Stanford University during her competitive career until her move to Boulder, Colorado, during the 1987–88 season, and had resumed her studies by 1989. She graduated from Stanford in 1991 with a degree in engineering and then from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in 1997. Thomas followed this with a surgical residency at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Hospital and an orthopedic surgery residency at the Martin Luther King Jr./Charles Drew University Medical Center in South Central Los Angeles.

Thomas went on to become a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in hip and knee replacement. In June 2005, she graduated from the Orthopedic Residency Program at Charles R. Drew University in Los Angeles. She spent the next year preparing for Step I of the American Board of Orthopedic Surgeons&#x27; exam and working at King-Drew Medical Center as a junior-attending-physician specialist. In July 2006, she began a one-year fellowship at the Dorr Arthritis Institute at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, California, for sub-specialty training in adult-reconstructive surgery. In September 2007, she began working at Carle Clinic in Urbana, Illinois. During her medical career, while she was skilled at doing the procedures and well-liked by patients, she had difficulty working with other doctors due to her struggles with bipolar disorder, and went from clinic to clinic, never staying longer than one year.

As of December 2010, Thomas was in private practice at ORTHO X-cellence Debra J. Thomas, MD, PC in Richlands, Virginia, which has since ceased operations.

==Personal life==
Thomas, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, married Brian Vander Hogen on March 15, 1988, in Boulder, Colorado. After their relationship ended, she married a sports attorney, Chris Bequette, in autumn 1996. Before divorcing, they had a son named Luc Bequette (b. 1997), who as of 2021 played defensive tackle for UC Berkeley.

Thomas was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by April 2012. In November 2015, it was reported that she was living in a bed bug-infested trailer in the Appalachian Mountains with her fiancé who was struggling with anger and alcohol issues. Thomas stated that she was &quot;broke&quot;, having lost most of her savings through her two divorces and failed medical practice, and had lost custody of her son when he was 13. She was featured in the November 7, 2015, episode of the television series &quot;&quot; on the Oprah Winfrey Network. As of 2016, Thomas and fiancé Jamie Looney were living with Looney&#x27;s two sons, Ethan and Austin, in southwest Virginia.

Thomas currently lives and trains in Florida.

<doc id="554369" wikidata="Q5337642" url="?curid=554369" title="Edge Act">
<text>The Edge Act is a 1919 amendment to the United States Federal Reserve Act of 1913, codified at , which allows national banks to engage in international banking through subsidiaries chartered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The act is named after Walter Evans Edge, a U.S. Senator from New Jersey who sponsored the original legislation for these types of subsidiaries. The impetus for the act was to give U.S. firms more flexibility to compete with foreign firms.

==Edge Act Corporation (EAC)==
An Edge Act Corporation is a subsidiary of a bank or bank holding company or financial holding company, that is chartered by the Federal Reserve under Section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1916 and 1919, to engage in foreign banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board authorizes U.S. and foreign banking and financial organizations to establish Edge Act Corporations. It also regulates and examines the foreign activities of Edge Act Corporations and their subsidiaries. Foreign banks operating in the U.S. are permitted to organize and own an Edge Act Corporation. Prior to 1919, U.S. institutions were not permitted to own foreign banks. An EAC can own branches in the U.S., but may only conduct transactions directly linked to international trade.

===Structure===
By virtue of historical developments and funding considerations, an Edge Act Corporation is a domestic subsidiary that is generally held by a U.S. Member Bank; however, it may also be held directly by the bank holding company or financial holding Company. As of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA), an Edge Act Corporation may also be held by a Foreign Bank.

===Types===

* Banking Edge or Agreement Corporation, which is directly under control of a U.S. member bank or bank holding company, can receive deposits (without Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage) from, and make loans to, companies engaging in international business. This structure allows foreign branches of U.S. banks.
* Investment Edge or Agreement Corporation functions as an investment company, taking equity positions in foreign commercial and industrial organizations;

An Agreement Corporation is chartered by a state to engage in international banking (essentially a state-chartered EAC, so named because the corporation enters into an &quot;agreement&quot; with the Fed&#x27;s Board of Governors to limit its activities to those of an Edge Act Corporation, as if organized under Section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act. In reality, state supervision is superfluous, so Edge Act Corporations (rather than Agreement Corporations) are the vehicles of choice for international banking and financing operations.

Investment Edges expand the types of companies in which their parent banks may invest. By law, U.S. banks may invest abroad only in other banking organizations. However an Edge Act Corporation may invest in any type of foreign company, as long as it does not engage in business in the United States, including making any domestic loans.

Banking Edges extend the geographic reach of their parents because an Edge was not considered a bank and hence was not subject to the same interstate banking prohibitions. Thus in the 1960s, the trend was for banks from outside the state of New York to form Banking Edges and locate them in New York City for conducting international banking and for trading in foreign exchange. In the 1970s and 1980s, the trend was toward expansion into regional financial centers, such as Miami, Chicago, and San Francisco.

Legislation in the mid-1990s, providing for the removal of Federal Interstate Branching restrictions, undermined the appeal of Banking Edges, and their relative importance in international banking has therefore declined. Major disadvantages of a Banking Edge, compared with an agency, are the smaller size of its loans (due to its smaller capital base, compared with that of the agency&#x27;s parent bank) and the limitation of domestic lending ability to international or foreign business transactions. Of the 82 Edge and Agreement Corporations in operation at year-end 1999, 27 were Banking Edges located mostly in New York City and Miami with total assets of $18 billion.

===Largest Edges===
As of 1999, the three largest Edges were all holding companies under the Federal Reserve Regulatory District of New York.

*HSBC International Finance Corporation, an Investment Edge (Wilmington, Delaware)
:HSBC Holdings plc (London)

*Citibank International, a Banking Edge (Miami)
:Citigroup Inc. (New York)

*Banco Santander International, a Banking Edge (Miami)
: Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A. (Madrid)

In 1999, these institutions accounted for 81.6 percent of all assets (source: Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System).

In official documents, reference to an Edge Act Corporation typically mentions the state or city where it is domiciled.

<text>The Catholic Apostolic Church (CAC), also known as the Irvingian Church or Irvingite Church, is a denomination in the Restorationist branch of Christianity. It originated in Scotland around 1831 and later spread to Germany and the United States. The tradition to which the Catholic Apostolic Church belongs is sometimes referred to as Irvingism or the Irvingian movement after Edward Irving (1792–1834), a clergyman of the Church of Scotland credited with organising the movement.

The church was organised in 1835 with the fourfold ministry of &quot;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors&quot;. The denominations in the tradition of the Catholic Apostolic Church teach &quot;the restoration to the universal church of prophetic gifts by the direct inspiration of the Holy Ghost.&quot; 

As a result of schism within the Catholic Apostolic Church, other Irvingian Christian denominations emerged, including the Old Apostolic Church, New Apostolic Church, Reformed Old Apostolic Church and United Apostolic Church; of these, the New Apostolic Church is the largest Irvingian Christian denomination today, with 16 million members.

Irvingism has elaborate liturgies; it teaches three sacraments: Baptism, Holy Communion and Holy Sealing.

==History==
===Edward Irving===
Edward Irving, also a minister in the Church of Scotland, preached in his church at Regent Square in London on the speedy return of Jesus Christ and the real substance of his human nature.

Irving&#x27;s relationship to this community was, according to its members, somewhat similar to that of John the Baptist to the early Christian Church. He was the forerunner and prophet of the coming dispensation, not the founder of a new sect; and indeed the only connection which Irving seems to have had with the Catholic Apostolic Church was in fostering spiritual persons who had been driven out of other congregations for the exercise of their spiritual gifts.

Around him, as well as around other congregations of different origins, coalesced persons who had been driven out of other churches, wanting to &quot;exercise their spiritual gifts&quot;. Shortly after Irving&#x27;s trial and deposition (1831), he restarted meetings in a hired hall in London, and much of his original congregation followed him. Having been expelled from the Church of Scotland, Irving took to preaching in the open air in Islington, until a new church was built for him and his followers in Duncan Street, Islington, funded by Duncan Mackenzie of Barnsbury, a former elder of Irving&#x27;s London church.

Shortly after Irving&#x27;s trial and deposition (1831), certain persons were, at some meetings held for prayer, designated as &quot;called to be apostles of the Lord&quot; by certain others claiming prophetic gifts.

=== Naming of the apostles ===
In the year 1835, six months after Irving&#x27;s death, six other people were similarly designated as called to complete the number of the twelve, who were then formally separated, by the pastors of the local congregations to which they belonged, to their higher office in the universal church on 14 July 1835. This separation is understood by the community not as &quot;in any sense being a schism or separation from the one Catholic Church, but a separation to a special work of blessing and intercession on behalf of it.&quot; The twelve were afterwards guided to ordain others—twelve prophets, twelve evangelists, and twelve pastors, &quot;sharing equally with them the one Catholic Episcopate,&quot; and also seven deacons for administering the temporal affairs of the church catholic.

The names of those twelve apostles included John Bate Cardale, Henry Drummond, Spencer Perceval, Thomas Carlyle, and Duncan Mackenzie.

==Structure and ministries==
Each congregation was presided over by its &quot;angel&quot; or bishop (who ranks as angel-pastor in the Universal Church); under him are four-and-twenty priests, divided into the four ministries of &quot;elders, prophets, evangelists and pastors,&quot; and with these are the deacons, seven of whom regulate the temporal affairs of the church—besides whom there are also &quot;sub-deacons, acolytes, singers, and door-keepers.&quot; The understanding is that each elder, with his co-presbyters and deacons, shall have charge of 500 adult communicants in his district; but this has been but partially carried into practice. This is the full constitution of each particular church or congregation as founded by the &quot;restored apostles,&quot; each local church thus &quot;reflecting in its government the government of the church catholic by the angel or high priest Jesus Christ, and His forty-eight presbyters in their fourfold ministry (in which apostles and elders always rank first), and under these the deacons of the church catholic.&quot;

The priesthood is supported by tithes; it being deemed a duty on the part of all members of the church who receive yearly incomes to offer a tithe of their increase every week, besides the free-will offering for the support of the place of worship, and for the relief of distress. Each local church sends &quot;a tithe of its tithes&quot; to the Temple, by which the ministers of the Universal Church are supported and its administrative expenses defrayed; by these offerings, too, the needs of poorer churches are supplied.

==Liturgy and forms of worship==
===Sources of forms of worship===
For the service of the church a comprehensive book of liturgies and offices was provided by the apostles. It dates from 1842 and is based on the Anglican, Roman and Greek liturgies. Lights, incense, vestments, holy water, chrism, and other adjuncts of worship are in constant use. In 1911, the ceremonial in its completeness could be seen in the church in Gordon Square, London and elsewhere.

The daily worship consists of matins with proposition (or exposition) of the sacrament at 6 a.m., prayers at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., and vespers with proposition at 5 p.m. On all Sundays and holy days there is a &quot;solemn celebration of the eucharist&quot; at the high altar; on Sundays this is at 10 a.m. On other days low celebrations are held in the side-chapels, which with the chancel in all churches correctly built after apostolic directions are separated or marked off from the nave by open screens with gates. The community has always laid great stress on symbolism, and in the eucharist, while rejecting both transubstantiation and consubstantiation, holds strongly to a real (mystical) presence. It emphasizes also the phenomena of Christian experience and deems miracle and mystery to be of the essence of a spirit-filled church.

The services were published as &quot;The Liturgy and other Divine Offices of the Church&quot;. Apostle Cardale put together two large volumes of writings about the liturgy, with references to its history and the reasons for operating in the ways defined, which was published under the title &quot;Readings on the Liturgy&quot;.

The Eucharist, being the memorial sacrifice of Christ, is the central service. The Irvingian Churches teach the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though they rejected what they saw as the philosophical explanations of the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation as well as Lollardist doctrine of consubstantiation.

Some of the music in the Catholic Apostolic Church is composed by Edmund Hart Turpin, former secretary of the Royal College of Organists.

==Sacraments==
Irvingism teaches three sacraments: Baptism, Holy Communion and Holy Sealing.

==Number of congregations and members==

In 1911, the CAC claimed to have among its clergy many of the Roman, Anglican and other churches, the orders of those ordained by Greek, Roman and Anglican bishops being recognized by it with the simple confirmation of an &quot;apostolic act.&quot; The community had not changed in 1911 in general constitution or doctrine. At the time, it did not publish statistics, and its growth during late years before 1911 is said to have been more marked in the United States and in certain European countries, such as Germany, than in Great Britain. There are nine congregations enumerated in &quot;The Religious Life of London&quot; (1904).In the 21st century, of the principal CAC buildings in London, the Catholic Apostolic Central Church, in Gordon Square, survives and has been let for other religious purposes.

===Notable members===
Aside from Irving, notable members include Thomas Carlyle, Edward Wilton Eddis who contributed to the Catholic Apostolic hymnal, and Edmund Hart Turpin who contributed much to CAC music.

==New Apostolic Church==
In the 19th century, the Dutch branch of the Restored Apostolic Mission Church (at first known as , since 1893 officially registered as Hersteld Apostolische Zendingkerk (HAZK)) was created. This later became the New Apostolic Church.

==Notable buildings==

* The Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury in Gordon Square, London: a massive Early-English neo-Gothic building constructed 1850–1854, designed by Raphael Brandon.
* Maida Avenue, Paddington, London: built 1891–1894, designed by John Loughborough Pearson.
* Mansfield Place Church (now the Mansfield Traquair Centre), Edinburgh: a Scottish neo-Romanesque building completed in 1885, designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson.

== Shortage of holy order ==
All ministers in the church were ordained by an apostle, or under delegated authority of an apostle. Thus, following the death of the last of the apostles, Francis Valentine Woodhouse, in 1901, the consensus of trustees, who administer the remaining assets, has been that no further ordinations are possible.

== Archives ==
A collection of papers related to the Catholic Apostolic Church, compiled by the Cousland family of Glasgow, is held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.
