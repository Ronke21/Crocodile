<text>Ojibwe ( ), also known as Ojibwa ( ),&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-2/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-3/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ojibway, Otchipwe, Ojibwemowin, or Anishinaabemowin, is an indigenous language of North America of the Algonquian language family. The language is characterized by a series of dialects that have local names and frequently local writing systems. There is no single dialect that is considered the most prestigious or most prominent, and no standard writing system that covers all dialects.

Dialects of Ojibwemowin are spoken in Canada, from southwestern Quebec, through Ontario, Manitoba and parts of Saskatchewan, with outlying communities in Alberta; and in the United States, from Michigan to Wisconsin and Minnesota, with a number of communities in North Dakota and Montana, as well as groups that were removed to Kansas and Oklahoma during the Indian Removal period. While there is some variation in the classification of its dialects, at least the following are recognized, from east to west: Algonquin, Eastern Ojibwe, Ottawa (Odawa), Western Ojibwe (Saulteaux), Oji-Cree (Severn Ojibwe), Northwestern Ojibwe, and Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa). Based upon contemporary field research, J. R. Valentine also recognizes several other dialects: Berens Ojibwe in northwestern Ontario, which he distinguishes from Northwestern Ojibwe; North of (Lake) Superior; and Nipissing. The latter two cover approximately the same territory as Central Ojibwa, which he does not recognize.

The aggregated dialects of Ojibwemowin comprise the second most commonly spoken First Nations language in Canada (after Cree), and the fourth most widely spoken in the United States or Canada behind Navajo, the Inuit languages and Cree.

Ojibwemowin is a relatively healthy indigenous language. The Waadookodaading Ojibwe Language Immersion School in Hayward, Wisconsin teaches all classes to children in Ojibwe only. A similar program is also in place at Lowell Elementary School in Duluth, Minnesota.

==Classification==
The Algonquian language family of which Ojibwemowin is itself a member of the Algic language family, other Algic languages being Wiyot and Yurok. Ojibwe is sometimes described as a Central Algonquian language, along with Fox, Cree, Menominee, Miami-Illinois, Potawatomi, and Shawnee. Central Algonquian is a geographical term of convenience rather than a genetic subgroup, and its use does not indicate that the Central languages are more closely related to each other than to the other Algonquian languages.

===Exonyms and endonyms===
The most general Indigenous designation for the language is &#x27;speaking the native language&#x27; ( &#x27;native person,&#x27; verb suffix &#x27;speak a language,&#x27; suffix &#x27;nominalizer&#x27;), with varying spellings and pronunciations depending upon dialect. Some speakers use the term . The general term in Oji-Cree (Severn Ojibwe) is , although is widely recognized by Severn speakers. Some speakers of Saulteaux Ojibwe refer to their language as . The Ottawa dialect is sometimes referred to as , although the general designation is , with the latter term also applied to or Eastern Ojibwe. Other local terms are listed in Ojibwe dialects. English terms include &quot;Ojibwe&quot;, with variants including &quot;Ojibwa&quot; and &quot;Ojibway&quot;. The related term &quot;Chippewa&quot; is more commonly employed in the United States and in southwestern Ontario among descendants of Ojibwe migrants from the United States.

===Relationship with Potawatomi===
Ojibwe and Potawatomi are frequently viewed as being more closely related to each other than to other Algonquian languages. Ojibwe and Potawatomi have been proposed as likely candidates for forming a genetic subgroup within Proto-Algonquian, although the required research to ascertain the linguistic history and status of a hypothetical &quot;Ojibwe–Potawatomi&quot; subgroup has not yet been undertaken. A discussion of Algonquian family subgroups indicates that &quot;Ojibwe–Potawatomi is another possibility that awaits investigation.&quot; In a proposed consensus classification of Algonquian languages, Goddard (1996) classifies Ojibwa and Potawatomi as &quot;Ojibwayan,&quot; although no supporting evidence is adduced.

The Central languages share a significant number of common features. These features can generally be attributed to diffusion of features through borrowing: &quot;Extensive lexical, phonological, and perhaps grammatical borrowing—the diffusion of elements and features across language boundaries—appears to have been the major factor in giving the languages in the area of the Upper Great Lakes their generally similar cast, and it has not been possible to find any shared innovations substantial enough to require the postulation of a genetically distinct Central Algonquian subgroup.&quot;

The possibility that the proposed genetic subgrouping of Ojibwa and Potawatomi can also be accounted for as diffusion has also been raised: &quot;The putative Ojibwa–Potawatomi subgroup is similarly open to question, but cannot be evaluated without more information on Potawatomi dialects.&quot;

== History ==
===Lingua franca===
Several different Ojibwe dialects have functioned as a lingua franca or trade language in the circum-Great Lakes area, particularly in interactions with speakers of other Algonquian languages. Documentation of such usage dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, but earlier use is likely, with reports as early as 1703 suggesting that Ojibwe was used by different groups from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to Lake Winnipeg, and from as far south as Ohio to Hudson Bay.

Documentation from the 17th century indicates that the Wyandot language (also called Huron), one of the Iroquoian languages, was also used as a trade language east of the Great Lakes by speakers of the Nipissing and Algonquin dialects of Ojibwe, and also by other groups south of the Great Lakes, including the Winnebago and by a group of unknown affiliation identified only as &quot;Assistaeronon.&quot; The political decline of the Hurons in the 18th century and the ascendancy of Ojibwe-speaking groups including the Ottawa led to the replacement of Huron as a lingua franca.

In the area east of Georgian Bay, the Nipissing dialect was a trade language. In the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula, the area between Lake Erie and Lake Huron, and along the north shore of Georgian Bay, the Ottawa dialect served as a trade language. In the area south of Lake Superior and west of Lake Michigan Southwestern Ojibwe was the trade language. A widespread pattern of asymmetrical bilingualism is found in the area south of the Great Lakes in which speakers of Potawatomi or Menominee, both Algonquian languages, also spoke Ojibwe, but Ojibwe speakers did not speak the other languages. It is known that some speakers of Menominee also speak Ojibwe and that the pattern persisted into the 20th century. Similarly, bilingualism in Ojibwe is still common among Potawatomis who speak Potawatomi.

Reports from traders and travellers as early as 1744 indicate that speakers of Menominee, another Algonquian language, used Ojibwe as a lingua franca. Other reports from the 18th century and the early 19th century indicate that speakers of the unrelated Siouan language Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) also used Ojibwe when dealing with Europeans and others. Other reports indicate that agents of the American government at Green Bay, Wisconsin, spoke Ojibwe in their interactions with Menominee, with other reports indicating that &quot;the Chippewa, Menominee, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Sac, and Fox tribes used Ojibwe in intertribal communication...&quot; Some reports indicate that farther west, speakers of non-Algonquian languages such as Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), Iowa, and Pawnee spoke Ojibwe as an &quot;acquired language.&quot;

=== U.S. government attempt to erase native language ===
In the late 19th century, the American federal Native American boarding school initiative which forced Native American children to attend government-run boarding schools in an attempt to &quot;acculturate&quot; them into American society. Often far from their home communities, these schools attempted to remove any ties children had to their native culture and to limit their ability to visit home. Students were forced to speak English, cut their hair, dress in uniform, practise Christianity, and learn about European culture and history.

Although the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 mandated the phasing-out of the Native American boarding school program, the practice of sending youth to these institutions continued into the 1960s and 1970s. Because children were forced to live away from their home communities, many never had the opportunity to hear and use their native language. This government assimilation effort caused widespread loss of language and culture among indigenous communities, including the Ojibwe people.

=== Language revitalization ===
With the remaining population of native speakers declining as older generations pass away, many historians consider now an important point in the language&#x27;s history that will determine if it will proliferate or become extinct. Ojibwe historian Anton Treuer estimates that there are about 1,000 speakers of Ojibwe left in the United States, most residing in Minnesota on the Red Lake Indian Reservation or in Mille Lacs region. Teacher of the language Keller Paap approximates that most fluent speakers in the United States are over 70 years old, making exposure to spoken Ojibwemowin limited in many communities.

Ojibwe educators and scholars across the region are working with the remaining elders who speak Ojibwemowin, known as the First Speakers, so as to document and learn the language in hopes to preserve it and pass it on to the next generation of speakers. In recent years, historian and Ojibwe professor Anton Treuer has been recording stories told by about 50 different Ojibwe elders in their native language so as to preserve both the language and pieces of knowledge and history. Alongside his current mentor, a Ponemah elder named Eugene Stillday, he writes the recorded stories in both Ojibwe and translated English.

Recently, there has been more of a push toward bringing the Ojibwe language back into more common use, through language classes and programs sponsored by universities, sometimes available to non-students, which are essential to passing on the Ojibwe language. These courses mainly target adults and young adults; however, there are many resources for all age groups, including online games which provide domains for online language use. In the 1980s, The Northern Native-Languages Project was introduced in Ontario to get Indigenous languages such as Ojibwe, to be taught in schools. Years later, the first curriculum was established for the program and it was known as Native Languages 1987. There has also been an increase in published children&#x27;s literature. The increase in materials published in Ojibwe is essential to increasing the number of speakers. Language revitalization through Ojibwe frameworks also allows for cultural concepts to be conveyed through language.

A 2014 study has indicated that learning Indigenous languages such as Ojibwe in school helps in learning the language and language structure; however, it does not help grow the use of the language outside of a school setting. The most effective way of promoting language is being surrounded by the language, especially in a familial setting. This is difficult to replicate in schools, which is why speaking Ojibwe with family and in one&#x27;s home life is important in growing language revitalization.

Research has been done in Ojibwe communities to prove the important role language revitalization has in treating health concerns. The use of language connects a community through shared views and supports the well-being of said community. Researchers found that language and the notion of culture were intertwined together instead of being separate concepts, and the people who regularly practiced their language and culture were often associated with more positive health outcomes, particularly for psychological health and mental well-being.

An &quot;Ojibway Language and People&quot; app is an open-source app available for iOS devices. The Ojibwe People&#x27;s Dictionary is an online language resource created in collaboration with the University of Minnesota. It is an accessible system that allows users to search in English or Ojibwe and includes voice recordings for many of the 17 000 entries in the collection.

=== Language immersion schools ===
Despite what they have faced in the American and Canadian Governments&#x27; attempt to force Ojibwe into language death through the educational system, many indigenous communities across the Great Lakes region are making efforts towards the Ojibwe language revival by similarly using the school system. Largely inspired by the success of Polynesian languages immersion schools in Hawaii and New Zealand, similar school programs have been starting throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin in recent years. One of the most notable programs—developed by Ojibwe educators Lisa LaRonge and Keller Paap—is that of the Waadookodaading Ojibwe Language Immersion School located on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation in northern Wisconsin. Most students come from English-speaking homes and are learning Ojibwemowin as their second language. At this school, instructors and elders teach the preschoolers to third graders entirely in the Ojibwe language, so that by the time that students complete kindergarten, they know both English and Ojibwe alphabets and writing systems. In the classroom, students generally first become familiar with the language by hearing and speaking it and then advance to reading and writing it as well. They are taught mathematics, reading, social studies, music, and other typical school subjects through the medium of the Ojibwe language so as to increase student&#x27;s exposure to Ojibwemowin while providing a well-rounded education. In her research study on Ojibwe immersion schools, Ojibwe scholar and educator Mary Hermes suggests that educating through the Ojibwe language may be more culturally meaningful to communities than simply educating about the culture through English.

The goal, as with many other language immersion schools across the country, is to meet state-mandated standards for curriculum in the native language. This can be a challenge as public education standards are rigorous with curriculum on complex mathematic and scientific concepts occurring at the second and third grade levels. Ojibwe educators at these schools are constantly working with elders so as to design new ways to say lesser-used words in Ojibwe such as &quot;plastic&quot; or &quot;quotient&quot;. Because the Ojibwe language is traditionally oral, it is often difficult for educators to find adequate resources to develop the curriculum. Thus, through these school programs, the language is constantly evolving.

Many of these Ojibwe language immersion schools are also considering the question as to whether or not they should include English instruction. Some research suggests that learning to write in one&#x27;s first language is important prior to learning a second language. Therefore, many schools include some level of English education at certain grade levels.

Along with using the native language, Waadookodaading uses native ways of teaching in its education system. &quot;Ojibwemowin, the Ojibwe language, is a language of action.&quot; Therefore, students are encouraged to learn the language by observing and by doing. For example, each spring the students at Waadookodaading participate in a maple sugar harvest. Older students and elders instruct the younger students on the harvest process, narrating what they are doing in Ojibwemowin as the younger students observe. The younger students are then encouraged to participate as they learn, gathering wood, helping to drill trees, and hauling buckets of sap. Thus, the Ojibwe language is kept alive through indigenous methods of teaching, which emphasizes hands-on experiences, such as the sugar bush harvest. The language is then passed on in a similar manner in which it has been throughout history in that older members of the community—including elders/instructors and older students at the schools—relay their knowledge and experiences to the younger generation.

==Geographic distribution==
Ojibwe communities are found in Canada from southwestern Quebec, through Ontario, southern Manitoba and parts of southern Saskatchewan; and in the United States from northern Michigan through northern Wisconsin and northern Minnesota, with a number of communities in northern North Dakota and northern Montana. Groups of speakers of the Ottawa dialect migrated to Kansas and Oklahoma during the historical period, with a small amount of linguistic documentation of the language in Oklahoma. The presence of Ojibwe in British Columbia has been noted.

Current census data indicate that all varieties of Ojibwe are spoken by approximately 56,531 people. This figure reflects census data from the 2000 United States Census and the 2006 Canadian census. The Ojibwe language is reported as spoken by a total of 8,791 people in the United States of which 7,355 are Native Americans and by as many as 47,740 in Canada, making it one of the largest Algic languages by numbers of speakers.

The Red Lake, White Earth, and Leech Lake reservations are known for their tradition of singing hymns in the Ojibwe language. As of 2011, Ojibwe is the official language of Red Lake.

===Dialects===
Because the dialects of Ojibwe are at least partly mutually intelligible, Ojibwe is usually considered to be a single language with a number of dialects, i.e. Ojibwe is &quot;... conventionally regarded as a single language consisting of a continuum of dialectal varieties since ... every dialect is at least partly intelligible to the speakers of the neighboring dialects.&quot; The degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably; recent research has shown that there is strong differentiation between the Ottawa dialect spoken in southern Ontario and northern Michigan; the Severn Ojibwa dialect spoken in northern Ontario and Manitoba; and the Algonquin dialect spoken in southwestern Quebec. Valentine notes that isolation is the most plausible explanation for the distinctive linguistic features found in these three dialects. Many communities adjacent to these relatively sharply differentiated dialects show a mix of transitional features, reflecting overlap with other nearby dialects. While each of these dialects has undergone innovations that make them distinctive, their status as part of the Ojibwe language complex is not in dispute. The relatively low degrees of mutual intelligibility between some nonadjacent Ojibwe dialects led Rhodes and Todd to suggest that Ojibwe should be analyzed as a linguistic subgroup consisting of several languages.

While there is some variation in the classification of Ojibwe dialects, at a minimum the following are recognized, proceeding west to east: Western Ojibwe (Saulteaux), Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa), Northwestern Ojibwe, Severn Ojibwe (Oji-Cree), Ottawa (Odawa), Eastern Ojibwe, and Algonquin. Based upon contemporary field research, Valentine also recognizes several other dialects: Berens Ojibwe in northwestern Ontario, which he distinguishes from Northwestern Ojibwe; North of (Lake) Superior; and Nipissing. The latter two cover approximately the same territory as Central Ojibwa, which he does not recognize.

Two recent analyses of the relationships between the Ojibwe dialects are in agreement on the assignment of the strongly differentiated Ottawa dialect to a separate subgroup, and the assignment of Severn Ojibwe and Algonquin to another subgroup, and differ primarily with respect to the relationships between the less strongly differentiated dialects. Rhodes and Todd recognize several different dialectal subgroupings within Ojibwe: (a) Ottawa; (b) Severn and Algonquian; (c) a third subgroup which is further divided into (i) a subgrouping of Northwestern Ojibwe and Saulteaux, and a subgrouping consisting of Eastern Ojibwe and a further subgrouping comprising Southwestern Ojibwe and Central Ojibwe. Valentine has proposed that Ojibwe dialects are divided into three groups: a northern tier consisting of Severn Ojibwe and Algonquin; a southern tier consisting of &quot;Odawa, Chippewa, Eastern Ojibwe, the Ojibwe of the Border Lakes region between Minnesota and Ontario, and Saulteaux; and third, a transitional zone between these two polar groups, in which there is a mixture of northern and southern features.&quot;

===Influence on other languages===
Michif is a mixed language that primarily is based upon French and Plains Cree, with some vocabulary from Ojibwe, in addition to phonological influence in Michif-speaking communities where there is a significant Ojibwe influence. In locations such as Turtle Mountain, North Dakota individuals of Ojibwe ancestry now speak Michif and Ojibwe. Bungi Creole is an English-based Creole language spoken in Manitoba by the descendants of &quot;English, Scottish, and Orkney fur traders and their Cree or Saulteaux wives ...&quot;. Bungee incorporates elements of Cree; the name may be from the Ojibwe word &#x27;a little bit&#x27; or the Cree equivalent, but whether there is any other Ojibwe component in Bungee is not documented. Ojibwe borrowings have been noted in Menominee, a related Algonquian language.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
All dialects of Ojibwe generally have an inventory of 17 consonants. Most dialects have the segment glottal stop in their inventory of consonant phonemes; Severn Ojibwe and the Algonquin dialect have in its place. Some dialects have both segments phonetically, but only one is present in phonological representations. The Ottawa and Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) have in a small number of affective vocabulary items in addition to regular . Some dialects may have otherwise non-occurring sounds such as in loanwords.

Obstruent consonants are divided into lenis and fortis sets, with these features having varying phonological analyses and phonetic realizations cross-dialectally. In some dialects, such as Severn Ojibwe, members of the fortis set are realized as a sequence of followed by a single segment drawn from the set of lenis consonants: . Algonquin Ojibwe is reported as distinguishing fortis and lenis consonants on the basis of voicing, with fortis being voiceless and lenis being voiced. In other dialects fortis consonants are realized as having greater duration than the corresponding lenis consonant, invariably voiceless, &quot;vigorously articulated,&quot; and aspirated in certain environments. In some practical orthographies such as the widely-used double vowel system, fortis consonants are written with voiceless symbols: &quot;p, t, k, ch, s, sh&quot;.

Lenis consonants have normal duration and are typically voiced intervocalically. Although they may be devoiced at the end or beginning of a word, they are less vigorously articulated than fortis consonants, and are invariably unaspirated. In the double vowel system, lenis consonants are written with voiced symbols: &quot;b, d, g, j, z, zh&quot;.

All dialects of Ojibwe have two nasal consonants and , one labialized velar approximant , one palatal approximant , and either or .

===Vowels===
All dialects of Ojibwe have seven oral vowels. Vowel length is phonologically contrastive and so is phonemic. Although long and short vowels are phonetically distinguished by vowel quality, vowel length is phonologically relevant since the distinction between long and short vowels correlates with the occurrence of vowel syncope, which characterizes the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects, as well as word stress patterns in the language.

There are three short vowels and three corresponding long vowels in addition to a fourth long vowel , which lacks a corresponding short vowel. The short vowel typically has phonetic values centring on ; typically has values centring on ; and typically has values centring on . Long is pronounced for many speakers, and is often .

Ojibwe has nasal vowels. Some arise predictably by rule in all analyses, while other long nasal vowels are of uncertain phonological status. The latter have been analysed as underlying phonemes and/or as predictable and derived by the operation of phonological rules from sequences of a long vowel and /n/ and another segment, typically /j/.

Placement of word stress is determined by metrical rules that define a characteristic iambic metrical foot, in which a weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. A foot consists of a minimum of one syllable and a maximum of two syllables, with each foot containing a maximum of one strong syllable. The structure of the metrical foot defines the domain for relative prominence, in which a strong syllable is assigned stress because it is more prominent than the weak member of the foot. Typically, the strong syllable in the antepenultimate foot is assigned the primary stress.

Strong syllables that do not receive main stress are assigned at least secondary stress. In some dialects, metrically weak (unstressed) vowels at the beginning of a word are frequently lost. In the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects, all metrically weak vowels are deleted. For example, (airplane(s), in the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect) is stressed as [&quot;be · mise · magak&quot; ] in the singular but as [&quot;be · mise · maga · kin&quot; ] in the plural. In some other dialects, metrically weak (unstressed) vowels, especially &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, are reduced to a schwa and depending on the writer, may be transcribed as &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot; or &quot;a&quot;. For example, [&quot;ana · mi&#x27;e · gii · zhigad&quot; ] (Sunday, literally &#x27;prayer day&#x27;) may be transcribed as in those dialects.

==Grammar==
The general grammatical characteristics of Ojibwe are shared across its dialects. The Ojibwe language is polysynthetic, exhibiting characteristics of synthesis and a high morpheme-to-word ratio. Ojibwe is a head-marking language in which inflectional morphology on nouns and particularly verbs carries significant amounts of grammatical information.

Word classes include nouns, verbs, grammatical particles, pronouns, preverbs, and prenouns. Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject and verb–subject–object. While verb-final orders are dispreferred, all logically possible orders are attested.

Complex inflectional and derivational morphology play a central role in Ojibwe grammar. Noun inflection and particularly verb inflection indicate a wide variety of grammatical information, realized through the use of prefixes and suffixes added to word stems. Grammatical characteristics include the following:

# Grammatical gender, divided into animate and inanimate categories
# extensive head-marking on verbs of inflectional information concerning person
# number
# tense
# modality
# evidentiality
# negation
# a distinction between obviative and proximate third-person, marked on both verbs and nouns.

There is a distinction between two different types of third person: the &quot;proximate&quot; (the third person deemed more important or in focus) and the &quot;obviative&quot; (the third person deemed less important or out of focus). Nouns can be singular or plural in number and either animate or inanimate in gender. Separate personal pronouns exist but are used mainly for emphasis; they distinguish inclusive and exclusive first-person plurals.

Verbs, the most complex word class, are inflected for one of three &quot;orders&quot; (&quot;indicative&quot;, the default; &quot;conjunct&quot;, used for participles and in subordinate clauses; and &quot;imperative&quot;, used with commands), as negative or affirmative, and for the person, number, animacy, and proximate/obviative status of both the subject and object as well as for several different &quot;modes&quot; (including the &quot;dubitative&quot; and &quot;preterit&quot;) and tenses.

==Vocabulary==

===Loanwords and neologisms===
Although it does contain a few loans from English (e.g. , &#x27;coffee&#x27;) and French (e.g. , &#x27;handkerchief&#x27; (from ), , &#x27;tea&#x27; (from , &#x27;the tea&#x27;), in general, the Ojibwe language is notable for its relative lack of borrowing from other languages. Instead, speakers far prefer to create words for new concepts from existing vocabulary. For example in Minnesota &quot;Ojibwemowin&quot;, &#x27;airplane&#x27; is , literally &#x27;thing that flies&#x27; (from , &#x27;to fly&#x27;), and &#x27;battery&#x27; is , literally &#x27;little fire-box&#x27; (from , &#x27;fire&#x27;, and , &#x27;box&#x27;). Even &#x27;coffee&#x27; is called (&#x27;black liquid-medicine&#x27;) by many speakers, rather than . These new words vary from region to region, and occasionally from community to community. For example, in Northwest Ontario &quot;Ojibwemowin&quot;, &#x27;airplane&#x27; is , literally &#x27;device that gets uplifted by the wind&#x27; (from , &#x27;to be uplifted by the wind&#x27;) as opposed to the Minnesota .

===Dialect variation===
Like any language dialects spanning vast regions, some words that may have had identical meaning at one time have evolved to have different meanings today. For example, (literally &#x27;small[-amount of] money&#x27; and used to refer to coins) specifically means &#x27;dime&#x27; (10-cent piece) in the United States, but a &#x27;quarter&#x27; (25-cent piece) in Canada, or (literally &#x27;thing to sit upon&#x27;) means &#x27;couch&#x27; or &#x27;chair&#x27; in Canada, but is used to specifically mean &#x27;saddle&#x27; in the United States.

Cases like &#x27;battery&#x27; and &#x27;coffee&#x27; also demonstrate the often great difference between the literal meanings of the individual morphemes in a word, and the overall meaning of the entire word.

==Writing system==
There is no standard writing system used for all Ojibwe dialects. Local alphabets have been developed by adapting the Latin script, usually based on English or French orthography. A syllabic writing system, not related to English or French writing, is used by some Ojibwe speakers in northern Ontario and Manitoba. Great Lakes Algonquian syllabics are based on the French alphabet with letters organized into syllables. It was used primarily by speakers of Fox, Potawatomi, and Winnebago, but there is some indirect evidence of use by speakers of Southwestern Ojibwe.

A widely used Roman character-based writing system is the double vowel system devised by Charles Fiero. Although there is no standard orthography, the double vowel system is used by many Ojibwe language teachers because of its ease of use. A wide range of materials have been published in the system, including a grammar, dictionaries, collections of texts, and pedagogical grammars. In northern Ontario and Manitoba, Ojibwe is most commonly written using the Cree syllabary, a syllabary originally developed by Methodist missionary James Evans around 1840 to write Cree. The syllabic system is based in part on Evans&#x27; knowledge of Pitman&#x27;s shorthand and his prior experience developing a distinctive alphabetic writing system for Ojibwe in southern Ontario.

===Double vowel system===
The double vowel system uses three short vowels, four long vowels, and eighteen consonants, represented with the following Roman letters:

a aa b ch d e g h &#x27; i ii j k m n o oo p s sh t w y z zh

<text>Francis Alvin George Hamilton (March 30, 1912June 29, 2004) was a Canadian politician. Hamilton led the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan from 1949 until he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1957 general election. That election brought the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to power under John Diefenbaker. He served as Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources, 1957 to 1960. He promoted a new vision of northern development. He was Minister of Agriculture, 1960 to 1963, where he promoted wheat sales to China.

==Life and career==
Born in Kenora, Ontario, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938 from the University of Saskatchewan. During World War II, he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force as a navigator and flight lieutenant. He was awarded the Burma Star Decoration.

After the war, he ran three times unsuccessfully as the Progressive Conservative candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1945, 1949, and 1953 elections. He was elected in 1957 in the riding of Qu&#x27;Appelle and re-elected 4 more times in 1958, 1962, 1963, and 1965. He ran in the riding of Regina East in the 1968 federal election, and lost by 192 votes to the New Democrat candidate. He was elected again in the 1972 federal election in the riding of Qu&#x27;Appelle—Moose Mountain and was re-elected 4 more times in 1974, 1979, 1980, and 1984. He retired in 1988.

Hamilton served as Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources in the Diefenbaker cabinet from 1957 to 1960, supporting a new vision of northern development. From 1960 to the 1963 election, when the Diefenbaker government was defeated, Hamilton served as Minister of Agriculture, pioneering wheat sales to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He was a candidate at the 1967 PC leadership convention, making it to the fourth ballot before dropping out.

In 1992, Hamilton was granted the honorific style of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; by Elizabeth II in honour of his service to Canada. This is a rare honour for someone who did not serve as Prime Minister of Canada, Chief Justice of Canada or Governor General of Canada.

After Hamilton retired from politics in 1988, he lived a relatively secluded life in the Ottawa-area town of Manotick, where he lived until his death in 2004. On June 28, 2007, the newly refurbished Government of Canada Building in downtown Regina, Saskatchewan, was officially named the Francis Alvin George Hamilton Building. Also, one of the reception rooms at the Embassy of Canada to China in Beijing is called the Alvin Hamilton Room.

<doc id="544741" wikidata="Q5241699" url="?curid=544741" title="Davie Fulton">
<text>Edmund Davie Fulton (March 10, 1916 – May 22, 2000) was a Canadian Rhodes Scholar, politician and judge. He was born in Kamloops, British Columbia, the son of politician/lawyer Frederick John Fulton and Winnifred M. Davie, daughter of A. E. B. Davie. He was the youngest of 4 children.

==Military career==
Davie Fulton served in the Second World War with the Canadian Army overseas as Platoon and Company Commander with Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, and as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in the Italian and Northwestern Europe campaigns. His brother John &quot;Moose&quot; Fulton distinguished himself in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He went missing in action in late 1942, and in 1943 Kamloops adopted the Moose Squadron in honour of its commander. In 1944 the Kamloops airport was dedicated as Fulton Field.

==Political career==
He was brought home from the war by the Conservative Party and won a seat by 100 votes in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1945 general election.

In 1949, he introduced legislation to criminalize the publication, distribution, and sale of crime comics, as the result of a murder by two Yukon teens that was blamed on the influence of the crime comics which the perpetrators had read.

He ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada at the 1956 leadership convention, placing third behind John Diefenbaker.

When Diefenbaker led the party to victory in the 1957 election, he appointed Fulton to Cabinet as Minister of Justice. As Minister, Fulton was involved in negotiations to patriate the Canadian Constitution, and developed the &quot;Fulton–Favreau formula&quot;. In 1962, he became Minister of Public Works. His cousin, Albert McPhillips, was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries around this time.

He resigned from Cabinet in 1963, when he decided to leave federal politics and take the leadership of the British Columbia Progressive Conservative Party. His efforts to revive the provincial Tories in BC were a failure, and he returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 election.

Fulton stood as a candidate at the 1967 federal PC leadership convention, and placed third behind Robert Stanfield and Dufferin Roblin.

After losing his seat in the 1968 election, he retired from politics and returned to the law. In 1973, he became a justice on the British Columbia Supreme Court, and served until 1981, resigning as a result of impaired driving conviction.

== Resigning from the B.C. Supreme Court ==
Fulton tenure ended in 1982 with his resignation to then Prime Minister, Jean Chretien. Issue relating to charges of drunk driving, as well as stress resulting from false allegation of his engaging in prostitution, known as the Wendy King Case caused him to resign. The ghost writer and publisher of The Wendy King Story, apologized in court, &quot;saying it was a case of mistaken identity.&quot; King also admitted the same in court,This libel action has its origin in the fact that I sincerely believed that the plaintiff, Justice E. Davie Fulton, was on one occasion a client of mine in my professional capacity as a prostitute,&#x27; King&#x27;s statement read.

As a result of evidence recently disclosed to me, I now realize that I was in error in believing that I had ever met Justice Fulton or that I had associated with him in any way.Fulton stated that stress from these false allegation had caused his drinking,Because of the strain and emotional turmoil of this libel action, my problem with alcohol has come back in concentrated form.

In February 1979, as a result drinking and driving incident and an automobile accident, Fulton had his license suspended. During the stop, Fulton &quot;admitted he had used &#x27;intemperate language&#x27;,&quot; telling the police to &quot;Go to hell.&quot; He was involved in a hit-and-run incident, also in February 1979, where the &quot;owner of the vehicle involved told police he had followed the hit-and-run car...to the judge&#x27;s house.&quot; In March 1979, Fulton pled guilty to drinking and driving charges.

The 1981 drinking-and-driving incident was a second offence; he received a $700 fine and a mandatory 14 days in jail. He was also disbarred from the B.C. Law Society. 

== Later life ==
From 1986 to 1992, Fulton served as a commissioner on the International Joint Commission. In 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. 

He died in Vancouver on May 22, 2000.

<doc id="544742" wikidata="Q26774" url="?curid=544742" title="Shoshone">
<text>The Shoshone or Shoshoni ( or ), also known by the endonym Newe, are an Indigenous people of the United States with four large cultural/linguistic divisions: 
* Eastern Shoshone: Wyoming
* Northern Shoshone: southern Idaho
* Western Shoshone: Nevada, northern Utah
* Goshute: western Utah, eastern Nevada

They traditionally speak the Shoshoni language, part of the Numic languages branch of the large Uto-Aztecan language family. The Shoshone were sometimes called the Snake Indians by neighboring tribes and early American explorers.

Their peoples have become members of federally recognized tribes throughout their traditional areas of settlement, often co-located with the Northern Paiute people of the Great Basin.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Shoshone&quot; comes from &quot;Sosoni&quot;, a Shoshone word for high-growing grasses. Some neighboring tribes call the Shoshone &quot;Grass House People,&quot; based on their traditional homes made from &quot;sosoni&quot;. Shoshones call themselves &quot;Newe&quot;, meaning &quot;People&quot;.

Meriwether Lewis recorded the tribe as the &quot;Sosonees or snake Indians&quot; in 1805.

==Language==
The Shoshoni language is spoken by approximately 1,000 people today. It belongs to the Central Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Speakers are scattered from central Nevada to central Wyoming.

The largest numbers of Shoshoni speakers live on the federally recognized Duck Valley Indian Reservation, located on the border of Nevada and Idaho; and Goshute Reservation in Utah. Idaho State University also offers Shoshoni-language classes.

==History==

The Shoshone are a Native American tribe that originated in the western Great Basin and spread north and east into present-day Idaho and Wyoming. By 1500, some Eastern Shoshone had crossed the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains. After 1750, warfare and pressure from the Blackfoot, Crow, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho pushed Eastern Shoshone south and westward. Some of them moved as far south as Texas, emerging as the Comanche by 1700.

As more European American settlers migrated west, tensions rose with the indigenous people over competition for territory and resources. Wars occurred throughout the second half of the 19th century. The Northern Shoshone, led by Chief Pocatello, fought during the 1860s against settlers in Idaho (where the city Pocatello was named for him). As more settlers encroached on Shoshone hunting territory, the natives raided farms and ranches for food and attacked immigrants.

The warfare resulted in the Bear River Massacre (1863) when U.S. forces attacked and killed an estimated 250 Northwestern Shoshone, who were at their winter encampment in present-day Franklin County, Idaho. A large number of the dead were non-combatants, including children, deliberately killed by the soldiers. This was the highest number of deaths which the Shoshone suffered at the hands of United States forces. 21 US soldiers were also killed.

During the American Civil War travelers continued to migrate westward along the Westward Expansion Trails. When the Shoshone, along with the Utes participated in attacks on the mail route that ran west out of Fort Laramie, the mail route had to be relocated south of the trail through Wyoming.

Allied with the Bannock, to whom they were related, the Shoshone fought against the United States in the Snake War from 1864 to 1868. They fought U.S. forces together in 1878 in the Bannock War. In 1876, by contrast, the Shoshone fought alongside the U.S. Army in the Battle of the Rosebud against their traditional enemies, the Lakota and Cheyenne.

In 1879 a band of approximately 300 Eastern Shoshone (known as &quot;Sheepeaters&quot;) became involved in the Sheepeater Indian War. It was the last Indian war fought in the Pacific Northwest region of the present-day United States.

In 1911 a small group of Bannock under a leader named Mike Daggett, also known as &quot;Shoshone Mike,&quot; killed four ranchers in Washoe County, Nevada. The settlers formed a posse and went out after the Native Americans. They caught up with the Bannock band on February 25, 1911, and in a gun battle killed Mike Daggett and seven members of his band. They lost one man of the posse, Ed Hogle in the Battle of Kelley Creek. The posse captured an infant named Mary Jo Estep, along with two children and a young woman. The three older captives died of diseases within a year; Mary Jo Estep survived, and passed away in 1992, around the age of 82.

A rancher donated the partial remains of three adult males, two adult females, two adolescent males, and three children (believed to be Mike Daggett and his family, according to contemporary accounts) to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., for study. In 1994, the institution repatriated the remains to the Fort Hall Idaho Shoshone-Bannock Tribe.

In 2008 the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation acquired the site of the Bear River Massacre and some surrounding land. They wanted to protect the holy land and to build a memorial to the massacre, the largest their nation had suffered. &quot;In partnership with the American West Heritage Center and state leaders in Idaho and Utah, the tribe has developed public/private partnerships to advance tribal cultural preservation and economic development goals.&quot; They have become leaders in developing tribal renewable energy.

==Historical population==
The Shoshone were scattered over a vast area and divided into many bands, therefore many estimates of their population did not cover the entire tribe. In 1820 Jedidiah Morse estimated the Shoshone population at 60,000 and 20,000 Eastern Shoshone. According to Alexander Ross the Shoshone were on the west side of the Rocky Mountains what the Sioux were on the east side - the most powerful tribe - and he estimated that in 1855 the Shoshone numbered 36,000 people. They were much reduced in number after they had suffered infectious disease epidemics and warfare. According to Joseph Lane the Shoshone were divided into many bands and it was almost impossible to ascertain their exact numbers. According to Indian Affairs 1859 in Utah there were 4,500 Shoshones. Indian Affairs 1866 reported in Utah 4,500 eastern Bannock and Shoshone intermingled and 3,800 western and northwestern Shoshone as well as 2,000 Shoshone in Nevada and 2,500 Shoshone in Idaho, as well as an unspecified number in Oregon. The completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869 was followed by European-American immigrants arriving in unprecedented numbers in the territory. Indian Affairs 1875 gave the Shoshone as 1,740 in Idaho and Montana, 1,945 in Nevada, 700 in Wyoming and 244 (besides those intermixed with the Bannock) in Oregon. The census of 1910 returned 3,840 Shoshone. In 1937, the Bureau of Indian Affairs counted 3,650 Northern Shoshone and 1,201 Western Shoshone. As of the 2000 U.S. census, some 12,000 persons identified as Shoshone. As of 2020 there were in the USA 17,918 Shoshone including 3,638 in Nevada and 3,491 in Wyoming.

<doc id="544743" wikidata="Q1153641" url="?curid=544743" title="Wolfram syndrome">
<text>Wolfram syndrome, also called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness), is a rare autosomal-recessive genetic disorder that causes childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness as well as various other possible disorders including neurodegeneration. Symptoms can start to appear as early as childhood to adult years (2–65 years old). There is a 25% recurrence risk in children.

It was first described in four siblings in 1938 by Dr. Don J. Wolfram, M.D. In 1995, diagnostic criteria were created based on the profiles of 45 patients. The disease affects the central nervous system (especially the brainstem). There are two subtypes – Wolfram Syndrome Type 1 (WFS1) and Wolfram Syndrome Type 2 (WFS2), that are distinguished by their causative gene.

Less than 5,000 people in the US have this disease, with WFS1 being more common than WFS2.

==Causes==

Wolfram syndrome was initially thought to be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction due to several reports of mitochondrial DNA mutations. However, it has now been established that Wolfram syndrome is caused by a congenital endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction.

Two forms have been described: Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1), and Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2).

===WFS1===
The WFS1 or wolframin gene provides instructions for making the wolframin protein. The WFS1 gene is active in cells throughout the body, with strong activity in the heart, brain, lungs, inner ear, and pancreas. The pancreas provides enzymes that help digest food, and it also produces the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.

Within cells, wolframin is located in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many activities, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3-dimensional shape to function properly. The endoplasmic reticulum also helps transport proteins, fats, and other materials to specific sites within the cell or to the cell surface. The function of wolframin is unknown. Based on its location in the endoplasmic reticulum, however, it may play a role in protein folding or cellular transport. In the pancreas, wolframin may help fold a protein precursor of insulin (called proinsulin) into the mature hormone that controls blood glucose levels. Research findings also suggest that wolframin may help maintain the correct cellular level of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) by controlling how much is stored in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the inner ear, wolframin may help maintain the proper levels of calcium ions or other charged particles that are essential for hearing. Mutation in the WFS1 lead to ER stress due to an increase in the accumulation of misfolded proteins. As there is a high level of misfolded protein, unfolded protein response (UPR) is stimulated and lead to transcriptional and translational process that can restore ER homeostasis, However, if the ER stress is present persistently due to physiological or pathophysiological events, the UPR will induce apoptosis.

More than 30 WFS1 mutations have been identified in individuals with a form of nonsyndromic deafness (hearing loss without related signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body) called DFNA6. Individuals with DFNA6 deafness cannot hear low tones (low-frequency sounds), such as a tuba or the &quot;m&quot; in moon. DFNA6 hearing loss is unlike most forms of nonsyndromic deafness that affect high tones (high-frequency sounds), such as birds chirping, or all frequencies of sound. Most WFS1 mutations replace one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make wolframin with an incorrect amino acid. One mutation deletes an amino acid from wolframin. WFS1 mutations probably alter the 3-dimensional shape of wolframin, which could affect its function. Because the function of wolframin is unknown, however, it is unclear how WFS1 mutations cause hearing loss. Some researchers suggest that altered wolframin disturbs the balance of charged particles in the inner ear, which interferes with the hearing process.

=== Other disorders - caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene ===

Mutations in the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome, which is also known by the acronym DIDMOAD. This syndrome is characterised by childhood-onset diabetes mellitus (DM), which results from the improper control of glucose due to the lack of insulin; a gradual loss of vision caused by optic atrophy (OA), in which the nerve that connects the eye to the brain wastes away; and deafness (D). This syndrome can sometimes cause diabetes insipidus (DI), a condition in which the kidneys cannot conserve water. Other complications that affect the bladder and nervous system may also occur. Researchers have identified more than 100 WFS1 mutations that cause Wolfram syndrome. Some mutations delete or insert DNA from the WFS1 gene. As a result, little or no wolframin is present in cells. Other mutations replace one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make wolframin with an incorrect amino acid. These mutations appear to reduce wolframin activity dramatically. Researchers suggest that the loss of wolframin disrupts the production of insulin, which leads to poor glucose control and diabetes mellitus. It is unclear how WFS1 mutations lead to other features of Wolfram syndrome.

=== WFS2 ===

Wolfram Syndrome Type 2 (WFS2) is a subtype of Wolfram Syndrome caused by a mutation in the CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 2 gene (CISD2 gene). CISD2 is a protein coding gene that is primarily found on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), though some studies have shown that it can also be localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mutation of this gene effects the protein folding of the ER and functions of the mitochondria, which leads to the signs and symptoms seen in those with WFS2. In some cases, mutation of the gene can lead to premature aging, mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. In studies using mice, WFS2 caused a decrease in ER Ca2+ and increase in mitochondrial Ca2+. This causes an increase in stress to the ER and activates an unfolded protein response (UPR). Further studies are still needed to better understand WFS2 and the neurodegenerative effects it has.

Clinical features of both WFS1 and WFS2 are diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy/neuropathy, sensorineural deafness, and genitourinary problems. Although both types have some overlapping symptoms, there are some differences that help us distinguish between the two. One of the main ones is that WFS2, it is not associated with diabetes insipidus or psychiatric disorders but is instead associated with higher bleed risks and peptic ulcers.

CISD2 gene consists of 3 exons on chromosome 4q24, which encodes the protein NAF-1 (nutrient deprivation autophagy factor-1). Therefore, if WFS2 were suspected in a patient, it may help to do a gene sequencing of the three exons and their intronic regions for a genetic analysis.

WFS2 is the rarest and most recently discovered subtype of Wolfram syndrome.

== Epidemiology ==
Wolfram syndrome is considered a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. According to the draft International Classification of Disease (ICD-11), Wolfram Syndrome is classified as a rare specified diabetes mellitus. The disease is estimated to affect 1 in 160,000 to 770,00. More specifically, the disease prevalence is 1 in 770,00 in the UK, 1 in 710,000 in Japan, 1 in 100,00 in North America, 0.74 in 1,000,000 in Italy, 1 in 68,000 in Lebanon and the highest prevalence is 1 in 54,478 in a small area of Sicily (Italy). It is believed that the populations with high prevalence have high-rate of consanguinity. The frequency of WSF1 mutation carrier is estimated to be 1 in 354 in the UK population and the disease is estimated to affect 1 out of 150 patient with juvenile-onset insulin-independent diabetes mellitus.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome is multifaceted, involving clinical evaluation, genetic testing, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies. Clinical evaluation typically begins with a detailed medical history and physical examination, where patients often present with juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus followed by progressive optic atrophy, a condition where the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain, deteriorate over time, leading to vision loss. There is an increased suspicion when diabetes is diagnosed in kids under 16. More evidence shows that Wolfram syndrome varies in how it appears. 

The syndrome can present with various symptoms. In addition to diabetes and optic atrophy, patient may exhibit diabetes insipidus, a condition where the kidneys cannot retain water, leading to frequent urination and excessive thirst. They might also have sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or the nerves that connect the ear to the brain. Neurological abnormalities such as ataxia (lack of muscle coordination) or myoclonus (sudden, involunatry muscle jerks) may also be observed. The progression of symptoms, starting with type 1 diabetes and subsequent vision loss within the first decade of life, is a critical diagnostic clue. 

Imaging studies are essential for understanding the extent of brain and optic nerve damage in Wolfram syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show significant shrinkage of the brain stem and cerebellum, region of the brain in motor control and coordination. These change can resemble changes seen in other neurodegenerative disorders, which are diseases that involve the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons. Additionally, areas of the pons, part of the brainstem, may show increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, indicating potential damage or changes in tissue composition. The connections between the cerebellum and the brainstem (middle cerebellar peduncles) can also exhibit atrophy, consistent with Wolfram syndrome. Changes in the optic radiations, which are the pathways transmitting visual information from the eyes to the brain, can be detected, aligning with the optic atrophy characteristic of Wolfram syndrome. Furthermore, the absence of the typical T1 hyperintensity in the posterior pituitary lobe suggests a lack of vasopressin-containing neurons, often linked with diabetes insipidus, another symptom of Wolfram syndrome. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to measure retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, aiding in the assessment of optic atrophy and monitoring disease progression .

Nowadays, genetic testing are used commonly to confirm the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome. Initially, patient with hereditary optic neuropathy who tested negative for mutation in the common optic neuropathy genes OPA1, OPA3 and LHON were selected for further genetic testing for WS. The primary genetic lotus associated with this syndrome is WFS1, and Sanger sequencing ( a method of reading the genetic code) of this gene typically confirms the diagnosis. Most patient exhibit recessive mutation in WFS1, meaning they inherited two copies of the mutated genes, one from each parents. However, some dominant mutation, such as H313Y, have been identified, where one copy of the mutated gene can cause the disorder. These dominant mutation are often linked to low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which affects the ability to hear low-pitched sounds. Additionally, there have been recent discoveries of autosomal dominant diabetes, where diabetes is inherited in a dominant manner, in patients with WFS1 mutations. Interpreting genetic testing results requires specialized knowledge due to the complexity of the mutation. 

Detailed family history is important as WS2 inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families to understand the inheritance pattern, risks to other family members, and reproductive options. A minority of patients have recessive mutation in the CISD2 (WFS2) gene, and for those without WFS1 mutations, Sanger sequencing of WFS2 is conducted. Efforts are underway to develop diagnosis methods based on exome (sequencing all the protein-coding regions of the genes) and genome sequencing (sequencing the entire gentic code) for Wolfram syndrome and related disorder. 

Other diagnostic tools include audiological tests to identify sensorineural hearing loss, a common feature of Wolfram syndrome, and psychiatric evaluations to address cognitive or behavioral issues arising from neurodegenerative nature of the disease. Audiological tests help assess the extent of hearing loss and guide interventions like hearing aids or other assistive devices. Psychiatric evaluations are important because the neurological aspects of Wolfram syndrome can lead to cognitive decline or behavioral changes, which require appropriate management and support. Combining these diagnostic approaches ensures a comprehensive understanding and management of Wolfram syndrome.

==Treatment==
There is no known direct treatment. Current treatment efforts focus on managing the complications of Wolfram syndrome. Intranasal or oral desmopressin has been shown to improve symptoms for the treatment of diabetes insipidus caused by Wolfram syndrome. Patients with Wolfram syndrome experiencing hearing loss have benefited from the use of cochlear implants and hearing aids. While there are no therapies currently available to slow the progression of neurological manifestations, swallowing therapy and esophagomyotomy have been shown to be useful in alleviating some of the neurological symptoms. Anticholinergic medications, clean intermittent catheterizations, electrical stimulation, and physiotherapy have been shown to be effective at managing urological abnormalities due to Wolfram syndrome such as neurogenic bladder and upper urinary tract dilation.

While there are no direct treatments, many therapies are currently being investigated for their efficacy at treating Wolfram syndrome. Gene and regenerative therapies are currently being studied for their efficacy in replacing damaged tissues due to Wolfram syndrome, such as pancreatic β-cells, neuronal, and retinal cells.

WFS1 mutations cause proteins in the ER to fold improperly, leading to ER stress. ER stress stimulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which causes cell apoptosis for pancreatic β-cells. Chemical chaperones are being investigated for their effect on reducing the UPR response and thus delaying disease progression by preventing cell death.  The FDA has approved 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) as chemical chaperones to reduce ER stress to delay neurodegeneration in patients with Wolfram syndrome. As of 2023, sodium valproate—an anti-epileptic drug—is being investigated as a therapy for Wolfram syndrome due to studies showing its ability to inhibit ER stress-induced apoptosis, reducing neurodegeneration. Liraglutide—a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP 1-R) agonist—has been hypothesized to be an effective therapy, as it has been shown to improve diabetes mellitus, reduce cell death due to ER stress, reduce neuroinflammation, protect retinal ganglion cell death, and prevent optic nerve degeneration.  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have also been hypothesized to be efficacious in the treatment of Wolfram syndrome due to their ability to activate GLP 1-R, similar to liraglutide.  However, the efficacy and safety of using liraglutide and DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome has not been well studied yet. 

ER calcium levels have also been identified as a target for Wolfram syndrome therapy. WFS1 mutations increase cytosolic calcium, leading to the activation of cysteine proteases known as calpains. Increased calpains activation is associated which cell death. As of 2021, dantrolene sodium—a medication indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia and muscle spasms—was being investigated in patients with Wolfram syndrome in a phase 2 clinical trial.

Overall, there is currently no treatment guideline for treating or slowing down the progression of Wolfram Syndrome. Treatment is more so focused on treating and managing the symptoms. Research is still being conducted in finding more effective treatment strategies, including studies on drugs that can reduce dell damage, gene therapies, and regenerative therapies. 

==Prognosis==
Wolfram Syndrome prognosis is very poor with a median mortality rate of 65% before the age of 35 (age range 25–39). The two main reason for death in patient with Wolfram syndrome are central respiratory failure, due to severe neurological disability, and renal failure secondary to infections. Unfortunately, currently, there is no effective treatment that can delay or reverse the progression of the disease.

The first symptom is typically diabetes mellitus, which is usually diagnosed around the age of 6. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus associate with Wolfram syndrome is differed from type 1 diabetes mellitus by having earlier diagnosis, rarely having positive auto-antibodies and ketoacidosis, having longer remission, needing less daily insulin, having lower average HbA1c level and more frequent hypoglycemia.

The second most common clinical manifestation of the disease is diabetes insipidus, which the kidney is unable to retain water due to renal outflow tract dilation and leads to high level of urine production. This condition affects around 70% of the patients with WSF1 mutation (WFS2 mutation does not typically associate with diabetes insipidus). Diabetes insipidus occurs around the age of 14 but the condition is often diagnosed late. Therefore, there is a high variability in the onset age.

The next symptom to appear is often optic atrophy, optical shrinkage that due to retinal ganglion cell axons&#x27; degeneration, around the age of 11. Blindness tends to develop a few years after the decrease in visual ability with the loss of color vision. Ophthalmic abnormalities often found in the patient with Wolfram Syndrome are cataract, nystagmus, glaucoma and maculopathy. There is also pigmentary retinopathy due to mitochondrial alteration that associated with Wolfram Syndrome. However, it is very rare and have been found in just a few cases.

Approximately 65% of the patients with Wolfram Syndrome experienced sensorineural deafness which can manifest as deafness at birth or mild hearing loss in adolescence years and progressively worsen. However, the progression of sensorineural deafness is relatively slow and initially influenced the high-frequency sounds. Patients with WFS1 mutation have degenerative impairment in the central nervous system, as they increased in age they are more likely to suffer a more severe deafness than other patients that have hearing loss.

The majority of patient (&gt;60%) with WSF1 mutation develop neurological symptoms around the age of 40; however, some may experience these symptoms earlier in life. Some most common neurological abnormalities are cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, cognitive impairement, dysphagia, dysarthria and diminish sense of taste and smell. In addition, patient can also experienced orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, hypothermia/hyperthermia, hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis, constipation and headache. Furthermore, there were also cases which patients also have severe depression, sleep abnormalities, psychosis and physical aggression. The occurrence of the above conditions can add complexity to the clinical presentation of Wolfram Syndrome.

Urinary tract disorders are also found in more than 90% patient with Wolfram Syndrome, in which neurogenic bladder is the main manifestation of neurological disorder that can lead to urinary incontinence, hydroureter and recurrent infections. More specifically, recurrent UTIs are one of the most prevalence clinical challenge associated with Wolfram Syndrome. These urological abnormalities are usually onset at the age of 20 and can be peaked at 13, 21 and 33 years of age. Furthermore, bladder dysfunction can progress to megacystis over time.

Endocrine dysfunction is another clinical manifestation of Wolfram syndrome, which include hypogonadism. More specifically, hypogonadism present more frequent in male than female. Male patients are more likely to experience fertility impairment and erectile dysfunction while female patient will encounter some menstrual abnormalities. Additionally, due to the decrease in function of the anterior pituitary gland, patients with Wolfram syndrome can also have short statue, growth hormone deficiency and corticotrophin secretion deficiency. Since patient with Wolfram Syndrome can experienced diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus and urinary tract disorder, they are treated with desmopressin, which can lead to the development of hyponatremia.

There are other abnormalities that associated with Wolfram Syndrome such as gastrointestinal disorders (gastroparesis and bowel incontinence) and heart disease. These disorders have been reported in rare cases of WFS1 mutation.

<doc id="544744" wikidata="Q2670778" url="?curid=544744" title="Lashon hara">
<text>Lashon hara (or loshon horo, or loshon hora) (; &quot;evil tongue&quot;) is the halakhic term for speech about a person or persons that is negative or harmful to them, even though it is true. It is speech that damages the person(s) who is talked about either emotionally or financially, or lowers them in the estimation of others. 

&quot;Lashon hara&quot; differs from the more severe prohibition of &quot;hotzaat shem ra&quot;, &quot;making a bad name,&quot; in that &quot;hotzaat shem ra&quot; consists of untrue statements.

&quot;Lashon hara&quot; is considered to be a very serious sin in the Jewish tradition. The communicator of &quot;lashon hara&quot; (which is included in &quot;rechilut&quot;) violates the Torah prohibition of &quot;lo telech rachil b&#x27;ameicha,&quot; translating to &quot;thou shalt not go up and down as a among thy people&quot; (&quot;Leviticus 19:16&quot; KJV).

==Definition==
Speech is considered to be &quot;lashon hara&quot; (detraction) if it says something negative about a person or party, is not seriously intended to correct or improve a negative situation, and is true. Statements that fit this description are considered to be &quot;lashon hara&quot;, regardless of the method of communication that is used, whether it is through face-to-face conversation, a letter, telephone, or email, or even body language.

By contrast, &quot;hotzaat shem ra&quot; (&quot;spreading a bad name&quot;) – also called &quot;hotzaat diba&quot; or &quot;motzi shem ra&quot; (lit. &quot;putting out a bad name&quot;) – consists of lies, and is best translated as &quot;slander&quot; or &quot;defamation&quot; (calumny). &quot;Hotzaat shem ra&quot; is an even graver sin than &quot;lashon hara&quot;.

The act of gossiping is called &quot;rechilut&quot;, and is also forbidden by halakha.

==Etymology==
The phrase consists of the noun (&quot;tongue&quot;), the definite article , and the adjective (&quot;evil&quot;). The Hebrew noun means &quot;tongue&quot; and – as in many languages – &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;language&quot;. The phrase is generally translated as &quot;evil speech&quot;. The term corresponds to the idea of an &quot;evil tongue&quot; in other cultures, such as the Latin , the French , and the Spanish .

==Sources==

The term &quot;lashon hara&quot; is not mentioned in the Tanakh, but &quot;keep thy tongue from evil&quot; () occurs in Psalm 34:14. The Torah contains a general injunction against &quot;rekhilut&quot; (gossip): &quot;Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I am the .&quot; The Biblical curse on one who &quot;strikes his fellow in secret&quot; is understood by the rabbis to refer to &quot;lashon hara&quot;, as it is a form of harming a person without their knowledge.

The Talmud lists &quot;lashon hara&quot; as one of the causes of the Biblical malady of &quot;tzaraath&quot;. Elsewhere, it declares that habitual speakers of &quot;lashon hara&quot; are not tolerated in God&#x27;s presence. Similar strong denouncements can be found in various places in Jewish literature.

In Numbers chapter 12, Miriam gossips with her brother Aaron, questioning why Moses is more qualified to lead the Jewish people than anyone else. God hears and strikes her down with &quot;tzaraath&quot;. Miriam had to stay outside of the camp for a week due to the &quot;tzaraath&quot;. During this time, all of Israel waited for her.

==Chofetz Chaim==
Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan wrote two major halakhic works on the evil tongue: &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot; (&quot;Desirer of Life&quot;, ) and &quot;Shmirat HaLashon&quot; (&quot;Guarding the tongue&quot;), both 1873. The &quot;Chafetz Chaim&quot; lists 31 speech-related commandments mentioned in the Torah. An English adaptation, &quot;Guard Your Tongue&quot; (2002), anthologizes the teachings of these two books.

==&quot;Baalei lashon hara&quot;==
The expression &quot;baalei lashon hara&quot; literally means &quot;masters of evil tongue&quot;, and it refers to habitual speakers of &quot;lashon hara&quot;. The serious prohibition of communicating &quot;lashon harah&quot; relates foremost to somebody who incidentally did so. Someone who makes it his habit to talk &quot;lashon harah&quot; about others (&quot;did you hear ...&quot;, &quot;do you already know ...&quot;, etc.) is called a &quot;ba&#x27;al lashon hara&quot;. By repeatedly communicating so, lashon hara became an integral part of this person, and his/her sins are far more severe, because this person regularly creates a &quot;chillul hashem&quot;, a &quot;desecration of the name of HaShem&quot; (). &quot;Lashon hara&quot;, &quot;rechilut&quot; and &quot;motzi shem ra&quot; are not accepted social tools in Judaism, because such behavior cuts the person who does in this manner off from many good things in the world around them. It is often phrased that one should stay away from people who communicate &quot;lashon hara&quot;, because any day, one will almost certainly become an object of derogatory communication by the same people.

==Exceptions==
Reporting abuse, especially if the abuse is illegal, is not Lashon hara, regardless of hashkafa.

There are times when a person is permitted or even required to disclose information whether or not the information is disparaging. For instance, if a person&#x27;s intent in sharing negative information is for a &quot;to&#x27;elet&quot;, a positive, constructive, and beneficial purpose that may serve as a warning to prevent harm or injustice, the prohibition against &quot;lashon hara&quot; does not apply. &quot;Hotzaat shem ra&quot;, spouting lies and spreading disinformation, is always prohibited. It is important to note that even with positive intentions, there are many important limitations regarding when it is permitted to speak &quot;lashon hara&quot;.

<doc id="544762" wikidata="Q190408" url="?curid=544762" title="Offset printing">
<text>Offset printing is a common printing technique in which the inked image is transferred (or &quot;offset&quot;) from a plate to a rubber blanket and then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier. Ink rollers transfer ink to the image areas of the image carrier, while a water roller applies a water-based film to the non-image areas.

The modern &quot;web&quot; process feeds a large reel of paper through a large press machine in several parts, typically for several meters, which then prints continuously as the paper is fed through.

Development of the offset press came in two versions: in 1875 by Robert Barclay of England for printing on tin and in 1904 by Ira Washington Rubel of the United States for printing on paper. Rubel&#x27;s contemporary in Continental Europe was Kašpar Hermann, the author of the offset machine prototype (1904), holder of a patent for an offset disc machine (two rubber transfer rollers facing each other) – rolling-press. In 1907, he successfully started printing in Germany on his Triumph sheetfed offset press.

==History==
Lithography was initially created to be an inexpensive method of reproducing artwork. This printing process was limited to use on flat, porous surfaces because the printing plates were produced from limestone. In fact the word &quot;lithograph&quot;, which comes from Greek (λιθογραφία), means &quot;an image from stone&quot; or &quot;written in stone&quot;.

The first rotary offset lithographic printing press was created in England and patented in 1875 by Robert Barclay. This development combined mid-19th century transfer printing technologies and Richard March Hoe&#x27;s 1843 rotary printing press—a press that used a metal cylinder instead of a flat stone. The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the stone to the surface of the metal. Later, the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber, which is still the most commonly used material.

As the 19th century closed and photography became popular, many lithographic firms went out of business. Photoengraving, a process that used halftone technology instead of illustration, became the primary aesthetic of the era. Many printers, including Ira Washington Rubel of New Jersey, were using the low-cost lithograph process to produce copies of photographs and books. Rubel discovered in 1901—by forgetting to load a sheet—that printing from the rubber roller, instead of the metal, made the printed page clearer and sharper. After further refinement, the Potter Press printing Company in New York produced a press in 1903. By 1907 the Rubel offset press was in use in San Francisco.

The Harris Automatic Press Company also created a similar press around the same time. Charles and Albert Harris modeled their press &quot;on a rotary letter press machine&quot;.

Newspaper publisher Staley T. McBrayer invented the Vanguard web offset press for newspaper printing, which he unveiled in 1954 in Fort Worth, Texas.

==Modern offset printing==
One of the important functions in the printing process is prepress production. This stage makes sure that all files are correctly processed in preparation for printing. This includes converting to the proper CMYK color model, finalizing the files, and creating plates for each color of the job to be run on the press.

Offset lithography is one of the most common ways of creating printed materials. A few of its common applications include: newspapers, magazines, brochures, stationery, and books. Compared to other printing methods, offset printing is best suited for economically producing large volumes of high quality prints in a manner that requires little maintenance. Many modern offset presses use computer-to-plate systems as opposed to the older computer-to-film work flows, which further increases their quality.

There are two types of offset printing: wet offset and waterless offset. Wet offset lithography uses a mix of wetting fluids (dampening solutions) to manage ink adhesion and to protect non-image areas. Waterless offset lithography employs a different method where a plate&#x27;s non-image areas are protected via a layer of ink-repellent silicon. Waterless offset lithography is newer, invented in the 1960s by 3M. It was later sold and commercialized by Toray.

Advantages of offset printing compared to other printing methods include:

* consistent high image quality. Offset printing produces sharp and clean images and type more easily than, for example, letterpress printing; this is because the rubber blanket conforms to the texture of the printing surface;
* quick and easy production of printing plates;
* longer printing plate life than on direct litho presses because there is no direct contact between the plate and the printing surface. Properly developed plates used with optimized inks and fountain solution may achieve run lengths of more than a million impressions;
* cost. Offset printing is the cheapest method for producing high quality prints in commercial printing quantities;
* ability to adjust the amount of ink on the fountain roller with screw keys. Most commonly, a metal blade controls the amount of ink transferred from the ink duct to the fountain roller. By adjusting the screws, the operator alters the gap between the blade and the fountain roller, increasing or decreasing the amount of ink applied to the roller in certain areas. This consequently modifies the density of the color in the respective area of the image. On older machines one adjusts the screws manually, but on modern machines the screw keys are operated electronically by the printer controlling the machine, enabling a much more precise result.

Disadvantages of offset printing compared to other printing methods include:
* slightly inferior image quality compared to rotogravure or photogravure printing;
* propensity for anodized aluminum printing plates to become sensitive (due to chemical oxidation) and print in non-image–background areas when developed plates are not cared for properly;
* time and cost associated with producing plates and printing press setup. As a result, very small quantity printing jobs may now use digital offset machines.

Every printing technology has its own identifying marks, and offset printing is no exception. In text reproduction, the type edges are sharp and have clear outlines. The paper surrounding the ink dots is usually unprinted. The halftone dots can be hexagonal though there are different screening methods.

== Process variations ==
Several variations of the printing process exist:
; Blanket-to-blanket : A printing method in which both sides of a sheet of paper are printed simultaneously, with two blanket cylinders per colour; a sheet of paper is passed between them, with each cylinder printing on one side of it.
Blanket-to-blanket presses are also called perfecting or duplex presses because they print on both sides of the sheet at the same time. There is no impression cylinder because the opposite blanket cylinders act as impression cylinders to each other during print production. This method is most used on offset presses designed for envelope printing. There are also two plate cylinders per colour on the press. Web and sheet-fed offset presses are similar in that many of them can also print on both sides of the paper in one pass, making it easier and faster to print duplex.
; Blanket-to-steel : A printing method similar to a sheet offset press; except that the plate and cylinder pressures are quite precise. Actual squeeze between plate and blanket cylinder is optimal at 0.005″; as is the squeeze or pressure between the blanket cylinder and the substrate. Blanket-to-steel presses are considered one-color presses. In order to print the reverse side, the web is turned over between printing units by means of turning bars. The method can be used to print business forms, computer letters and direct mail advertising.
; Variable-size printing : A printing process that uses removable printing units, inserts, or cassettes for one-sided and blanket-to-blanket two-sided printing.
; Keyless offset : A printing process that is based on the concept of using fresh ink for each revolution by removing residual inks on the inking drum after each revolution. It is suitable for printing newspapers.
; Dry offset printing : A printing process which uses a metal backed photopolymer relief plate, similar to a letterpress plate, but, unlike letterpress printing where the ink is transferred directly from the plate to the substrate, in dry offset printing the ink is transferred to a rubber blanket before being transferred to the substrate. This method is used for printing on injection moulded rigid plastic buckets, tubs, cups and flowerpots.

==Plates==
===Materials===
The plates used in offset printing are thin, flexible, and usually larger than the paper size to be printed. Two main materials are used:
* Metal plates, usually aluminum, although sometimes they are made of multi-metal, paper, or plastic.
* Polyester plates, which are much cheaper and can be used in place of aluminum plates for smaller formats or medium quality jobs, as their dimensional stability is lower.

===Computer-to-plate===
Computer-to-plate (CTP) is a newer technology which replaced computer-to-film (CTF) technology, and that allows the imaging of metal or polyester plates without the use of film. By eliminating the stripping, compositing, and traditional plate making processes, CTP altered the printing industry, which led to reduced prepress times, lower costs of labor, and improved print quality.

Most CTP systems use thermal CTP or violet technologies. Both technologies have the same characteristics in terms of quality and plate durability (for longer runs). However, the violet CTP systems are often cheaper than thermal ones, and thermal CTP systems do not need to be operated under yellow light.

Thermal CTP involves the use of thermal lasers to expose or remove areas of coating while the plate is being imaged. This depends on whether the plate is negative, or positive working. These lasers are generally at a wavelength of 830 nm, but vary in their energy usage depending on whether they are used to expose or ablate material. Violet CTP lasers have a much shorter wavelength, 405 nm–410 nm. Violet CTP is &quot;based on emulsion tuned to visible light exposure&quot;.

Another process is the computer-to-conventional plate (CTCP) system in which conventional offset plates can be exposed, making it an economical option.

==Sheet-fed offset==


Sheet-fed refers to individual sheets of paper or rolls being fed into a press via a suction bar that lifts and drops each sheet onto place. A lithographic (&quot;litho&quot; for short) press uses principles of lithography to apply ink to a printing plate, as explained previously. Sheet-fed litho is commonly used for printing of short-run magazines, brochures, letter headings, and general commercial (jobbing) printing. In sheet-fed offset, &quot;the printing is carried out on single sheets of paper as they are fed to the press one at a time&quot;. Sheet-fed presses use mechanical registration to relate each sheet to one another to ensure that they are reproduced with the same imagery in the same position on every sheet running through the press.

===Offset duplicators===
In the United States, an offset press with paper size up to , is classified as a duplicator instead of a press. Offset duplicators are used for fast, good quality reproduction of one-color and two-color copies in sizes up to . Popular models were made by A. B. Dick Company, Multilith, and the Chief and Davidson lines made by A.T.F.-Davidson. Offset duplicators are made for fast and quick printing jobs; printing up to 12,000 impressions per hour. They are able to print business forms, letterheads, labels, bulletins, postcards, envelopes, folders, reports, and sales literature.

===Feeder system===
The feeder system is responsible for making sure paper runs through the press correctly. This is where the substrate is loaded and then the system is correctly set up to the certain specifications of the substrate to the press.

===Printing–inking system===
The Printing Unit consists of many different systems. The dampening system is used to apply dampening solution to the plates with water rollers. The inking system uses rollers to deliver ink to the plate and blanket cylinders to be transferred to the substrate. The plate cylinder is where the plates containing all of the imaging are mounted. Finally, the blanket and impression cylinders are used to transfer the image to the substrate running through the press.

===Delivery system===
The delivery system is the final destination in the printing process while the paper runs through the press. Once the paper reaches delivery, it is stacked for the ink to cure in a proper manner. This is the step in which sheets are inspected to make sure they have proper ink density and registration.

===Slur===
Production or impact of double image in printing is known as slur.

==Web-fed offset==
Web-fed refers to the use of rolls (or &quot;webs&quot;) of paper supplied to the printing press. Offset web printing is generally used for runs in excess of five or ten thousand impressions. Typical examples of web printing include newspapers, newspaper inserts or ads, magazines, direct mail, catalogs, and books. Web-fed presses are divided into two general classes: &quot;cold-set&quot; (or &quot;non-heat-set&quot;) and &quot;heat-set&quot; offset web presses, the difference being how the inks dry. Cold web offset printing dries through absorption into the paper, while heat-set utilizes drying lamps or heaters to cure or &quot;set&quot; the inks. Heat-set presses can print on both coated (slick) and uncoated papers, while cold-set presses are restricted to uncoated paper stock, such as newsprint. Some cold-set web presses can be fitted with heat dryers, or ultraviolet lamps (for use with UV-curing inks), thus enabling a newspaper press to print color pages heat-set and black &amp; white pages cold-set.

Web offset presses are beneficial in long run printing jobs, typically press runs that exceed 10,000 or 20,000 impressions. Speed is a determining factor when considering the completion time for press production; some web presses print at speeds of per minute or faster. In addition to the benefits of speed and quick completion, some web presses have the inline ability to cut, perforate, and fold.

===Heat-set web offset===
This subset of web offset printing uses inks which dry by evaporation in a dryer typically positioned just after the printing units; it is typically done on coated papers, where the ink stays largely on the surface, and gives a glossy high contrast print image after the drying. As the paper leaves the dryer too hot for the folding and cutting that are typically downstream procedures, a set of &quot;chill rolls&quot; positioned after the dryer lowers the paper temperature and sets the ink. The speed at which the ink dries is a function of dryer temperature and length of time the paper is exposed to this temperature. This type of printing is typically used for magazines, catalogs, inserts, and other medium-to-high volume, medium-to-high quality production runs.

===Cold-set web offset===
This is also a subset of web offset printing, typically used for lower quality print output. It is typical of newspaper production. In this process, the ink dries by absorption into the underlying paper. A typical coldset configuration is often a series of vertically arranged print units and peripherals. As newspapers seek new markets, which often imply higher quality (more gloss, more contrast), they may add a heatset tower (with a dryer) or use UV (ultraviolet) based inks which &quot;cure&quot; on the surface by polymerization rather than by evaporation or absorption.

==Sheet-fed vs. web-fed==
Sheet-fed presses offer several advantages. Because individual sheets are fed through, a large number of sheet sizes and format sizes can be run through the same press. In addition, waste sheets can be used for make-ready (which is the testing process to ensure a quality print run). This allows for lower cost preparation so that good paper is not wasted while setting up the press, for plates and inks. Waste sheets do bring some disadvantages as often there are dust and offset powder particles that transfer on to the blankets and plate cylinders, creating imperfections on the printed sheet. This method produces the highest quality images.

Web-fed presses, on the other hand, are much faster than sheet-fed presses, with speeds up to 80,000 cut-offs per hour (a cut-off is the paper that has been cut off a reel or web on the press; the length of each sheet is equal to the cylinder&#x27;s circumference). The speed of web-fed presses makes them ideal for large runs such as newspapers, magazines, and comic books. However, web-fed presses have a fixed cut-off, unlike rotogravure or flexographic presses, which are variable.

==Inks==
Offset printing uses inks that, compared to other printing methods, are highly viscous. Typical inks have a dynamic viscosity of 40–100 Pa·s.

There are many types of paste inks available for utilization in offset lithographic printing and each have their own advantages and disadvantages. These include heat-set, cold-set, and energy-curable (or EC), such as ultraviolet- (or UV-) curable, and electron beam- (or EB-) curable. Heat-set inks are the most common variety and are &quot;set&quot; by applying heat and then rapid cooling to catalyze the curing process. They are used in magazines, catalogs, and inserts. Cold-set inks are set simply by absorption into non-coated stocks and are generally used for newspapers and books but are also found in insert printing and are the most economical option. Energy-curable inks are the highest-quality offset litho inks and are set by application of light energy. They require specialized equipment such as inter-station curing lamps, and are usually the most expensive type of offset litho ink.

* Letterset inks are mainly used with offset presses that do not have dampening systems and use imaging plates that have a raised image.
* Waterless inks are heat-resistant and are used to keep silicone-based plates from showing toning in non-image areas. These inks are typically used on waterless Direct Imaging presses.
* Single Fluid Inks are newer inks that use a process allowing lithographic plates on a lithographic press without using a dampening system during the process.

==In industry==
Offset lithography became the most popular form of commercial printing from the 1950s (&quot;offset printing&quot;). Substantial investment in the larger presses required for offset lithography was needed, and had an effect on the shape of the printing industry, leading to fewer, larger, printers. The change made a greatly increased use of colour printing possible, as this had previously been much more expensive. Subsequent improvements in plates, inks, and paper have further refined the technology of its superior production speed and plate durability. In 2003 lithography was described as the primary printing technology used in the U.S.; most often as offset lithography, “responsible for over half of all printing using printing plates”.

The education center and natural conservation area is wide and its surrounding wetland has an area of 1500 acres (6 km2). It provides a conservation area for mammals, reptiles, insects, and over 350 species of birds.

The reserve is managed by the World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong since 1983 and WWF runs professionally guided visits for the public and schools to the reserve; the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has responsibilities for the Ramsar site as a whole. Deep Bay faces threats, including pollution, local urban development plans and rising mudflat levels that perhaps arise from intense urbanization, especially (in recent years) on the north, Shenzhen side of the bay.

In recent years, it housed over 55,000 migrating birds, including Saunders&#x27;s gull (&quot;Chroicocephalus saundersi&quot;) and a quarter of the world&#x27;s Black-faced spoonbill (&quot;Platalea minor&quot;) population. However, the overall numbers are declining every year. The critically endangered Spoon-billed sandpiper (&quot;Calidris pygmaea&quot;) is still recorded regularly on migration. The reserve also includes inter-tidal mangroves along with 24 traditionally operated shrimp ponds (called Gei Wai locally) to provide food for the birds. Mai Po Marshes receives some 32,000 visitors annually.

While the area was taken out of the Frontier Closed Area on 15 February 2012, Mai Po Nature Reserve remains a restricted area under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance (Chapter 170) in order to minimize disturbance to wildlife.

Visitors need a &#x27;Mai Po Marshes Entry Permit&#x27; to enter the Reserve. By joining a WWF professionally guided activity and be part of a small group ecovisit, WWF will take care of permits for you. 

Individuals can apply for a permit by writing to the Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Conservation Department of Hong Kong Government. The aforementioned Individual Permits normally take about a week to be processed.

38 mammal species inhabit the reserve, more than anywhere else in Hong Kong. Mai Po is home to one of the highest densities of leopard cat in the territory, however they are nocturnal and rarely seen. Small Asian mongooses are quite common in the reserve, often encountered by visitors near Gei Wai ponds during the day in winter. A small population of Eurasian otters, a locally endangered species, is found in Mai Po.

The marshes also have rich insect biodiversity, housing the endemic Mai Po bent-winged firefly (&quot;Pteroptyx maipo&quot;) was discovered. Not only was the species new to science, but it was also the first time for the genus &quot;Pteroptyx&quot; has been recorded in China. To understand the seasonal population changes, distribution and habitat requirements of the species, WWF Hong Kong have been carrying out firefly surveys of the nature reserve. The surveys have also incorporated citizen science participation, and using this approach to further monitor the biodiversity, WWF have incorporated iNaturalist and the City Nature Challenge into activities at their Mai Po centre.

== Avian flu outbreak ==
In February 2008, the Hong Kong government closed Mai Po for 21 days following the discovery of a great egret infected with H5N1, also known as avian flu. The closing marked the fourth in as many years and was consistent with the government&#x27;s policy of closing Mai Po whenever an infection is discovered within a 3 kilometer radius of the premises.

The World Wide Fund for Nature criticized the government, however, for what it called a discrepancy between the standards for closing Mai Po and the comparably less strict standards applied in urban areas. The World Wide Fund for Nature wanted compensation of 1 million Hong Kong dollars. WWF then claimed that the government had not compensated it for lost income.

==Education==
Mai Po is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 74. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and one government school: Yuen Long Government Primary School (元朗官立小學).

<text>Rapla ( (the name &quot;Rappel&quot; was also used in other languages in the past) is a town in north-central Estonia&quot;,&quot; the capital of Rapla County and the centre of Rapla Parish.

== History ==
The oldest records date back to 1241 in the Danish Census Book, when it was said that it was a small village with 8 acres of cultivated fields. By the end of the 13th century, the village centre was firmly established. At around the same time, a Cistercian monastery was built.

Rapla&#x27;s ambitious period of fast growth began only in the late 19th century. In 1866, a pharmacy was built, in 1868 a school, and in 1888 a hospital. In 1898, a brick factory was opened, and in 1900, a railway line was built between Rapla and Viljandi. The old stone church was demolished in the late 19th century and a new one was built in a Romanesque style, one of the purest examples of this style in all of Estonia.

In 1913, Rapla consisted of around 20 stone and 60 wooden houses. During this time period, a number of social societies were established, such as the Volunteer Fire Company, the Song and Music Society, the Society of Agriculture, a Mutual Fire Insurance Company, a Consumer Association, and the Deposit Insurance Fund.

It has a railway station on the Tallinn–Viljandi railway line operated by Elron. In 1931, a narrow gauge railway from Rapla to Virtsu opened and remained in use until 1968.

Rapla received town rights in 1993.

<text>The Fulton–Favreau formula was a proposed formula of amendment of the Constitution of Canada developed by federal justice minister E. Davie Fulton and Quebec Liberal Guy Favreau in the 1960s. The Fulton–Favreau formula would have achieved the patriation of the Constitution.

==Amending formula==
Under the formula, all provinces would have to approve amendments that would be relevant to provincial jurisdiction including the use of the French and English languages, but only the relevant provinces would be needed to approve amendments concerned with a particular region of Canada. Two-thirds of the provinces representing half of the population, as well as the federal Parliament, would be needed for amendments regarding education.

==Debate==
During the negotiations, a number of controversies arose over the Fulton–Favreau accord, including that the unanimity constituted a &quot;strait jacket&quot; that would make the Constitution too difficult to amend. The premier of Saskatchewan also argued that the debates over Canadian federalism, particularly the increasing decentralization being pushed for by regional leaders such as Quebec Premier Jean Lesage, threatened to render the federal government powerless, to the &quot;point of no return&quot;, at which point Canada would no longer be a viable entity. In turn, Lesage argued he was merely pushing for Quebec and French Canada to fully develop their rightful roles within Canada.

New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas also expressed concern that, while the patriation of the Constitution would be beneficial, the new Constitution would &quot;entrench&quot; property and civil rights. This would make the jurisdictional issue amendable only by unanimity, which would potentially threaten growth of labour legislation, medicare and other social services.

==Legacy==
Though the formula officially died in 1965 when Quebec Premier Lesage withdrew his support, a modified version of this formula was finally adopted in 1982, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982 and the patriation of the Canadian Constitution.

<doc id="544776" wikidata="Q827291" url="?curid=544776" title="Soil liquefaction">
<text>Soil liquefaction occurs when a cohesionless saturated or partially saturated soil substantially loses strength and stiffness in response to an applied stress such as shaking during an earthquake or other sudden change in stress condition, in which material that is ordinarily a solid behaves like a liquid. In soil mechanics, the term &quot;liquefied&quot; was first used by Allen Hazen in reference to the 1918 failure of the Calaveras Dam in California. He described the mechanism of flow liquefaction of the embankment dam as:

The phenomenon is most often observed in saturated, loose (low density or uncompacted), sandy soils. This is because a loose sand has a tendency to compress when a load is applied. Dense sands, by contrast, tend to expand in volume or &#x27;dilate&#x27;. If the soil is saturated by water, a condition that often exists when the soil is below the water table or sea level, then water fills the gaps between soil grains (&#x27;pore spaces&#x27;). In response to soil compressing, the pore water pressure increases and the water attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure (usually upward towards the ground surface). However, if the loading is rapidly applied and large enough, or is repeated many times (e.g., earthquake shaking, storm wave loading) such that the water does not flow out before the next cycle of load is applied, the water pressures may build to the extent that it exceeds the force (contact stresses) between the grains of soil that keep them in contact. These contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers is transferred from the ground surface to layers of soil or rock at greater depths. This loss of soil structure causes it to lose its strength (the ability to transfer shear stress), and it may be observed to flow like a liquid (hence &#x27;liquefaction&#x27;).

Although the effects of soil liquefaction have been long understood, engineers took more notice after the 1964 Alaska earthquake and 1964 Niigata earthquake. It was a major cause of the destruction produced in San Francisco&#x27;s Marina District during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and in the Port of Kobe during the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake. More recently soil liquefaction was largely responsible for extensive damage to residential properties in the eastern suburbs and satellite townships of Christchurch during the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and more extensively again following the Christchurch earthquakes that followed in early and mid-2011. On 28 September 2018, an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude hit the Central Sulawesi province of Indonesia. Resulting soil liquefaction buried the suburb of Balaroa and Petobo village deep in mud. The government of Indonesia is considering designating the two neighborhoods of Balaroa and Petobo, that have been totally buried under mud, as mass graves.

The building codes in many countries require engineers to consider the effects of soil liquefaction in the design of new buildings and infrastructure such as bridges, embankment dams and retaining structures.

==Technical definitions==

Soil liquefaction occurs when the effective stress (shear strength) of soil is reduced to essentially zero. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (i.e., a single, sudden occurrence of a change in stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (i.e., repeated changes in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises, a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced. Liquefaction is more likely to occur in sandy or non-plastic silty soils but may in rare cases occur in gravels and clays (see quick clay).

A &#x27;flow failure&#x27; may initiate if the strength of the soil is reduced below the stresses required to maintain the equilibrium of a slope or footing of a structure. This can occur due to monotonic loading or cyclic loading and can be sudden and catastrophic. A historical example is the Aberfan disaster. Casagrande referred to this type of phenomena as &#x27;flow liquefaction&#x27; although a state of zero effective stress is not required for this to occur.

&#x27;Cyclic liquefaction&#x27; is the state of soil when large shear strains have accumulated in response to cyclic loading. A typical reference strain for the approximate occurrence of zero effective stress is 5% double amplitude shear strain. This is a soil test-based definition, usually performed via cyclic triaxial, cyclic direct simple shear, or cyclic torsional shear type apparatus. These tests are performed to determine a soil&#x27;s resistance to liquefaction by observing the number of cycles of loading at a particular shear stress amplitude required to induce &#x27;fails&#x27;. Failure here is defined by the aforementioned shear strain criteria.

The term &#x27;cyclic mobility&#x27; refers to the mechanism of progressive reduction of effective stress due to cyclic loading. This may occur in all soil types including dense soils. However, on reaching a state of zero effective stress such soils immediately dilate and regain strength. Thus, shear strains are significantly less than a true state of soil liquefaction.

==Occurrence==
Liquefaction is more likely to occur in loose to moderately saturated granular soils with poor drainage, such as silty sands or sands and gravels containing impermeable sediments. During wave loading, usually cyclic undrained loading, e.g. seismic loading, loose sands tend to decrease in volume, which produces an increase in their pore water pressures and consequently a decrease in shear strength, i.e. reduction in effective stress.

Deposits most susceptible to liquefaction are young (Holocene-age, deposited within the last 10,000 years) sands and silts of similar grain size (well-sorted), in beds at least metres thick, and saturated with water. Such deposits are often found along stream beds, beaches, dunes, and areas where windblown silt (loess) and sand have accumulated. Examples of soil liquefaction include quicksand, quick clay, turbidity currents and earthquake-induced liquefaction.

Depending on the initial void ratio, the soil material can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g., loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress is greater than the ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case &quot;flow liquefaction&quot; occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g., moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g., earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading depends on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, allowing cyclic liquefaction to take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress cannot occur, and cyclic mobility takes place.

The resistance of the cohesionless soil to liquefaction will depend on the density of the soil, confining stresses, soil structure (fabric, age and cementation), the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and the extent to which shear stress reversal occurs.

==Liquefaction potential: simplified empirical analysis==
Three parameters are needed to assess liquefaction potential using the &quot;simplified empirical method&quot;:
#A measure of soil resistance to liquefaction: Standard Penetration Resistance (SPT), Cone Penetration Resistance (CPT), or shear wave velocity (Vs)
#The earthquake load, measured as cyclic stress ratio formula_1
#the capacity of the soil to resist liquefaction, expressed in terms of the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR)

==Liquefaction potential: advanced constitutive model==
The interaction between the solid skeleton and pore fluid flow has been considered by many researchers to model the material softening associated with the liquefaction phenomenon. The dynamic performance of saturated porous media depends on the soil-pore fluid interaction. When the saturated porous media is subjected to strong ground shaking, pore fluid movement relative to the solid skeleton is induced. The transient movement of pore fluid can significantly affect the redistribution of pore water pressure, which is generally governed by the loading rate, soil permeability, pressure gradient, and boundary conditions. It is well known that for a sufficiently high seepage velocity, the governing flow law in porous media is nonlinear and does not follow Darcy&#x27;s law. This fact has been recently considered in the studies of soil-pore fluid interaction for liquefaction modeling. A fully explicit dynamic finite element method has been developed for turbulent flow law. The governing equations have been expressed for saturated porous media based on the extension of the Biot formulation. The elastoplastic behavior of soil under earthquake loading has been simulated using a generalized plasticity theory that is composed of a yield surface along with a non-associated flow rule.

==Earthquake liquefaction==
Pressures generated during large earthquakes can force underground water and liquefied sand to the surface. This can be observed at the surface as effects known alternatively as &quot;sand boils&quot;, &quot;sand blows&quot; or &quot;sand volcanoes&quot;. Such earthquake ground deformations can be categorized as primary deformation if located on or close to the ruptured fault, or distributed deformation if located at considerable distance from the ruptured fault.
The other common observation is land instability – cracking and movement of the ground down slope or towards unsupported margins of rivers, streams, or the coast. The failure of ground in this manner is called &#x27;lateral spreading&#x27; and may occur on very shallow slopes with angles only 1 or 2 degrees from the horizontal.

One positive aspect of soil liquefaction is the tendency for the effects of earthquake shaking to be significantly damped (reduced) for the remainder of the earthquake. This is because liquids do not support a shear stress and so once the soil liquefies due to shaking, subsequent earthquake shaking (transferred through ground by shear waves) is not transferred to buildings at the ground surface.

Studies of liquefaction features left by prehistoric earthquakes, called paleoliquefaction or paleoseismology, can reveal information about earthquakes that occurred before records were kept or accurate measurements could be taken.

Soil liquefaction induced by earthquake shaking is a major contributor to urban seismic risk.

==Effects==
The effects of soil liquefaction on the built environment can be extremely damaging. Buildings whose foundations bear directly on sand which liquefies will experience a sudden loss of support, which will result in drastic and irregular settlement of the building causing structural damage, including cracking of foundations and damage to the building structure, or leaving the structure unserviceable, even without structural damage. Where a thin crust of non-liquefied soil exists between building foundation and liquefied soil, a &#x27;punching shear&#x27; type foundation failure may occur. Irregular settlement may break underground utility lines. The upward pressure applied by the movement of liquefied soil through the crust layer can crack weak foundation slabs and enter buildings through service ducts and may allow water to damage building contents and electrical services.

Bridges and large buildings constructed on pile foundations may lose support from the adjacent soil and buckle or come to rest at a tilt.

Sloping ground and ground next to rivers and lakes may slide on a liquefied soil layer (termed &#x27;lateral spreading&#x27;), opening large ground fissures, and can cause significant damage to buildings, bridges, roads and services such as water, natural gas, sewerage, power and telecommunications installed in the affected ground. Buried tanks and manholes may float in the liquefied soil due to buoyancy. Earth embankments such as flood levees and earth dams may lose stability or collapse if the material comprising the embankment or its foundation liquefies.

Over geological time, liquefaction of soil material due to earthquakes could provide a dense parent material in which the fragipan may develop through pedogenesis.

==Mitigation methods==

Mitigation methods have been devised by earthquake engineers and include various soil compaction techniques such as vibro compaction (compaction of the soil by depth vibrators), dynamic compaction, and vibro stone columns. These methods densify soil and enable buildings to avoid soil liquefaction.

Existing buildings can be mitigated by injecting grout into the soil to stabilize the layer of soil that is subject to liquefaction. Another method called IPS (Induced Partial Saturation) is now practicable to apply on larger scale. In this method, the saturation degree of the soil is decreased.

==Quicksand==

Quicksand forms when water saturates an area of loose sand, and the sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer resist force. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, the force of the water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.

The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a change in pressure, or a shock initiates the liquefaction, causing the sand to form a suspension with each grain surrounded by a thin film of water. This cushioning gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluidlike texture. Objects in the liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced sand/water mix and the object &quot;floats&quot; due to its buoyancy.

==Quick clay==

Quick clay, known as &quot;Leda Clay&quot; in Canada, is a water-saturated gel, which in its solid form resembles highly sensitive clay. This clay has a tendency to change from a relatively stiff condition to a liquid mass when it is disturbed. This gradual change in appearance from solid to liquid is a process known as spontaneous liquefaction. The clay retains a solid structure despite its high-water content (up to 80% by volume), because surface tension holds water-coated flakes of clay together. When the structure is broken by a shock or sufficient shear, it enters a fluid state.

Quick clay is found only in northern countries such as Russia, Canada, Alaska in the U.S., Norway, Sweden and Finland, which were glaciated during the Pleistocene epoch.

Quick clay has been the underlying cause of many deadly landslides. In Canada alone, it has been associated with more than 250 mapped landslides. Some of these are ancient, and may have been triggered by earthquakes.

==Turbidity currents==

Submarine landslides are turbidity currents and consist of water-saturated sediments flowing downslope. An example occurred during the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake that struck the continental slope off the coast of Newfoundland. Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, further and further downslope, away from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. The exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100 km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water-saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600 km) down the continental slope from the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.

<doc id="544815" wikidata="Q16067670" url="?curid=544815" title="M. A. MacPherson">
<text>Murdoch Alexander MacPherson, (April 16, 1891 – June 12, 1966) was a Canadian politician, Attorney-General of Saskatchewan under Conservative Premier James T.M. Anderson from 1929 to 1932.

==Early life and education==
Born at MacPherson House on Cape Breton Island, MacPherson attended law school at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

==Military and legal career==
He served in World War I and commanded a company of the 10th Battalion at Battle of Vimy Ridge where he came out unscathed. He was wounded by shellfire, however, at Arleux, near Arras a few days later. MacPherson Avenue in Regina, Saskatchewan was later named in his honour, and is an official memorial of the Canadian Department of National Defence. After the war he practiced law in Saskatchewan and eventually became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (Q.C.).

==Political career==
MacPherson was first elected to the Saskatchewan legislative assembly in 1924, and remained a member of the Legislative Assembly until his defeat in the 1934 provincial election that wiped out the Conservative Party. He was called to Ottawa late in the term of the R.B. Bennett government to assist in creating the Farm Credit Corporation. In 1959, he headed a Royal Commission: the MacPherson Commission.

In 1938 and again in 1942, he was a candidate at the federal Conservative leadership conventions, coming in second place on both occasions.

==Personal life==
In May 1961, he received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from the University of Saskatchewan.

One of his three sons, Murdoch Alexander MacPherson Jr., known as &quot;Sandy&quot;, born in 1916, was a pillar of the local Progressive Conservative Party and of the non-concurring First Presbyterian congregation. He served as a justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench from 1961 to 1981; during this time, he sat on the custody case of Colin Thatcher.

M.A.&#x27;s second son, Ian, served in the Indian Army during the Second World War and after being promoted to the rank of acting Lieutenant-Colonel, was killed in action near Mawlu in Burma in April 1944. He is memorialized in Michael Calvert&#x27;s book &quot;Prisoners of Hope.&quot;

Another son, Donald K. MacPherson (always referred to and addressed as &quot;D.K. MacPherson&quot;), was a successful Saskatchewan labour lawyer and later Chief Justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench. D.K.&#x27;s son, Les MacPherson, is a retired columnist for the &quot;Saskatoon Star-Phoenix&quot; newspaper.

<doc id="544817" wikidata="Q279749" url="?curid=544817" title="Form (botany)">
<text>In botanical nomenclature, a form (&quot;forma&quot;, plural &quot;formae&quot;) is one of the &quot;secondary&quot; taxonomic ranks, below that of variety, which in turn is below that of species; it is an infraspecific taxon. If more than three ranks are listed in describing a taxon, the &quot;classification&quot; is being specified, but only three parts make up the &quot;name&quot; of the taxon: a genus name, a specific epithet, and an infraspecific epithet.

The abbreviation &quot;f.&quot; or the full &quot;forma&quot; should be put before the infraspecific epithet to indicate the rank. It is not italicised.

For example:
* &quot;Acanthocalycium spiniflorum&quot; f. &quot;klimpelianum&quot; or
** &quot;Acanthocalycium spiniflorum&quot; forma &quot;klimpelianum&quot; (Weidlich &amp; Werderm.) Donald
* &quot;Crataegus aestivalis&quot; (Walter) Torr. &amp; A.Gray var. &quot;cerasoides&quot; Sarg. f. &quot;luculenta&quot; Sarg. is a classification of a plant whose name is:
** &quot;Crataegus aestivalis&quot; (Walter) Torr. &amp; A.Gray f. &quot;luculenta&quot; Sarg.

A form usually designates a group with a noticeable morphological deviation. The usual taxonomic practice is that the individuals classified within the form are not necessarily known to be closely related (they may not form a clade). For instance, white-flowered plants of species that usually have coloured flowers can be grouped and named (e.g., as &quot;f. &quot;alba&quot;&quot;). Formae apomicticae are sometimes named among plants that reproduce asexually, by apomixis. There are theoretically countless numbers of forms based on minor genetic differences, and only a few that have particular significance are likely to be named.

<doc id="544818" wikidata="Q1282208" url="?curid=544818" title="W. W. Norton &amp; Company">
<text>W. W. Norton &amp; Company is an American publishing company based in New York City. Established in 1923, it has been owned wholly by its employees since the early 1960s. The company is known for its Norton Anthologies (particularly &quot;The Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;) and its texts in the Norton Critical Editions series, both of which are frequently assigned in university literature courses.

==History and overview==
The roots of the company date to 1923, when William Warder Norton founded the firm with his wife Mary Dows Herter Norton, and became its first president. In the 1960s, Mary Norton offered most of her stock to its leading editors and managers. Storer D. Lunt took over in 1945 after Norton&#x27;s death, and was succeeded by George Brockway (1957–1976), Donald S. Lamm (1976–1994), W. Drake McFeely (1994–2017), and Julia A. Reidhead (2017–present). Reidhead was vice president and publishing director of Norton&#x27;s College division and a former editor of the Norton Anthologies. 

Imprints of W. W. Norton include Norton Professional Books (professional works in mental health, well-being, architecture and design, and education), Countryman Press (lifestyle and instructional books, including healthy-living, cookbooks, and hiking guides), Liveright (20th century classics and new works), and Norton Young Readers (books for preschoolers to young adults).

In 2023, the company celebrated its 100th anniversary.

== Series ==
===Norton Anthologies===
Norton Anthologies collect canonical works from various literatures; perhaps the best known anthology in the series is the &quot;Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;, which, , is in its 10th edition. Norton Anthologies offer general headnotes on each author, a general introduction to each period of literature, and annotations for every anthologized text.

===Norton Critical Editions===
Like Oxford World&#x27;s Classics and Penguin Classics, Norton Critical Editions provide reprints of classic literature and in some cases, classic non-fiction works. However, unlike most critical editions, all Norton Critical Editions are sourcebooks that provide a selection of contextual documents and critical essays along with an edited text. Annotations to the text are provided as footnotes, rather than as endnotes. 

===&quot;The States and the Nation&quot;===
&quot;The States and the Nation&quot; series was published in celebration of the United States Bicentennial. It comprised 51 volumes, one for each state and the District of Columbia. The series was administered by the American Association for State and Local History via a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

<text>Piz Linard is a pyramid-shaped mountain of the Swiss Alps. At 3,410 m it is the highest peak of the Silvretta mountain range.

It was first climbed on August 1, 1835, by the geologist and naturalist Oswald Heer led by Johann Madutz.

There is a legend that a man of name &quot;Chounard&quot; reached the summit in 1572 carrying a large golden cross; however, the cross has never been found.

Piz Linard is located between the valleys of &quot;Val Lavinuoz&quot; (east) and &quot;Val Saglains&quot; (west), both part of the basin of the Inn river in the Engadine valley.

<doc id="544830" wikidata="Q638594" url="?curid=544830" title="Knud Ejler Løgstrup">
<text>Knud Ejler Løgstrup (2 September 1905 – 20 November 1981) was a Danish philosopher and theologian. His work, which combines elements of phenomenology, ethics and theology, has exerted considerable influence in postwar Nordic thought. More recently, his work has been discussed by prominent figures in anglophone philosophy and sociology such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Robert Stern, Simon Critchley and Zygmunt Bauman.

==Biography==
Løgstrup studied theology at the University of Copenhagen between 1923 and 1930, though his interests tended towards the philosophical aspects of the discipline. He subsequently studied under a number of prominent teachers in Strasbourg (Jean Hering), Paris (Henri Bergson), Göttingen (Hans Lipps and Friedrich Gogarten), Freiburg im Breisgau (Martin Heidegger), Vienna (Moritz Schlick) and Tübingen. Lipps, in particular, would have a particularly marked influence on Løgstrup&#x27;s thinking. Though Løgstrup was at Strasbourg when Emmanuel Levinas – to whom his work is often compared – was a student there, there is no evidence to suggest he and Levinas encountered one another.

In Freiburg, he met Rosalie Maria (Rosemarie) Pauly (1914–2005), a German fellow student whom he married in 1935. The following year he took up a position as a parish priest in Funen and continued to work on his dissertation, a critique of idealist epistemology. The dissertation was finally accepted in 1942 after several submissions. In 1943, he was appointed Professor of Ethics and Philosophy at the University of Aarhus. Shortly thereafter, however, Løgstrup was forced to go underground due to his activities in support of the Danish resistance.

From the 1930s, Løgstrup was a member of Tidehverv, a strongly anti-pietist movement within the Danish Church which at the time espoused a dialectical theology heavily influenced by Kierkegaard. However he drifted increasingly further from the group (and from its interpretation of Kierkegaard, particularly as espoused by Kristoffer Olesen Larsen) and broke with the movement in the early 1950s. Løgstrup retired from the University of Aarhus in 1975 but continued writing a four-volume work, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. Two volumes had been published by the time of his sudden death from a heart attack in 1981.

==Work==
===&quot;The Ethical Demand&quot;===
Løgstrup&#x27;s 1956 book &quot;The Ethical Demand&quot; (&quot;Den Etiske Fordring&quot;) develops an account of a demand Løgstrup takes to be built into our experience of life with other people:

Because we are in a position to influence, to some degree, how well another person&#x27;s life goes for them (even in very minor ways), we find ourselves in a position of power over them, and &quot;Because power is involved in every human relationship, we are always in advance compelled to decide whether to use our power over the other for serving him or for serving ourselves.&quot; For Løgstrup, the demand built into our dealings with others is that we act one-sidedly for the other&#x27;s sake, not our own: &quot;everything which an individual has opportunity to say and do in relation to the other person is to be done and said not for his own sake but for the sake of him or her whose life is in his hand.&quot; This demand ultimately turns out to be unfulfillable for Løgstrup in the sense that &quot;what is demanded is that the demand should not have been necessary.&quot; In other words, in any given situation where the ethical demand becomes salient, the agent has already failed to live up to it; the agent should simply have acted spontaneously with selfless concern for the other.

Løgstrup takes the ethical demand to be prior to social norms or moral principles. Such principles and norms cannot simply be ignored, and they may make us act as we would have done had we realized the ethical demand; for that reason they are morally useful. But ultimately they are only a substitute for genuinely realizing the ethical, not constitutive of doing so as mainstream moral philosophy assumes. &quot;The Ethical Demand&quot; contains analyses of concrete phenomena such as trust, which Løgstrup takes to be fundamental to moral life. Trust, for Løgstrup, is conceptually prior to distrust: the basic attitude built into discourse is a trust in the sincerity of the interlocutor, and hence it is only gradually that we learn to distrust others.

===Subsequent work===
In the decades following &quot;The Ethical Demand&quot; Løgstrup continued to develop his &#x27;ontological ethics&#x27; as an alternative to the standard deontic, utilitarian and virtue ethics frameworks. He continued to insist that while virtues, character traits, and duties could usefully provide &#x27;substitute&#x27; motives for moral action, these were always secondary: the ethical demand requires a spontaneous loving response to the other. Systems of norms only come into play in moral action when this spontaneous response has already failed.

Consequently, Løgstrup is critical of the emphasis on rule-following and universal principles in most anglophone moral theory. As an example, Løgstrup mentions Stephen Toulmin&#x27;s example of an everyday situation: &#x27;I have borrowed a book from John and the question is now, why should I give it back today as I promised him?&#x27; According to Toulmin, this question will push us to reflect on principles of ever-higher levels of abstraction: &quot;I should always keep my promises,&quot; &quot;I should never lie&quot; etc. For Løgstrup, this increasing universalisation leads to a &#x27;moralism&#x27; that abstracts from the concrete situation and the needs of the actual person. Instead, moral reflection should remain on the level of the given situation: &#x27;Because my friend needs the book back!&#x27;

===The sovereign expressions of life===
One of the early criticisms of &quot;The Ethical Demand&quot; was that it endorsed a form of naturalist fallacy: it inferred a (normative) responsibility to act for the sake of the other from the (descriptive) fact that the other is in our power. Partly in response to this objection, Løgstrup would go on to develop an account of the &quot;sovereign expressions of life&quot; (&quot;suværene livsytringer&quot;), which first appear in his 1968 book &quot;Opgør med Kierkegaard&quot; (&#x27;Settling Accounts with Kierkegaard&#x27; or &#x27;Confronting Kierkegaard&#x27;) and are further developed in &quot;Norm og Spontaneitet&quot; (&quot;Norm and Spontaneity,&quot; 1972). This category includes phenomena such as trust, openness of speech, and mercy. These phenomena present themselves to us, according to Løgstrup, as intrinsically good, rather than as neutral phenomena we need to evaluate against an external standard. They do not emanate from the agent, but from life itself, and demand submission rather than application (as with principles) or cultivation (as with virtues).

<text>Denton Massey (20 June 1900 – 25 January 1984) was a Canadian engineer, Anglican priest and politician.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, son of Walter Edward Massey and Susan Marie Denton Massey and the grandson of the founder of the Massey agricultural manufacturing company, Hart Massey, he attended St. Andrew&#x27;s College in Aurora, Ontario, and the University of Toronto, where he became a member of the Kappa Alpha Society, before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he received a degree in engineering in 1922.

Massey was the founder of the &quot;York Bible Class&quot; which attracted thousands of young people and began broadcasting on the fledgling Toronto radio station CFRB in March 1927. His religious programs were broadcast on Toronto radio stations both before and after World War II.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative MP for the Toronto riding of Greenwood from 1935 to 1949 and was, in 1938, an unsuccessful candidate at the Conservative leadership convention.

Massey joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940 and reached the rank of group captain. He was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire for his efforts during the war in 1946.

After leaving politics, Massey became a priest. He served at St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in Point Edward, Ontario, from 1960 to 1963 and the Church of the Holy Saviour in Waterloo, Ontario, from 1963 to 1970.

Massey was a cousin of Canadian Governor General Vincent Massey and actor Raymond Massey. He was also a cousin of Canadian philosopher George Grant and 21st-century Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff. His son was actor Walter Massey.

<text>Canal Street is a street in Manchester city centre in North West England and the centre of Manchester&#x27;s gay village. The pedestrianised street, which runs along the west side of the Rochdale Canal, is lined with gay bars and restaurants. At night time, and in daytime in the warmer months, the street is filled with visitors, often including LGBT tourists from all over the world. The northern end of the street meets Minshull Street and the southern meets Princess Street; part of the street looks across the Rochdale Canal into Sackville Gardens.

== History ==
Canal Street developed when the Rochdale Canal was constructed in 1804, a trade artery running through the city. Pubs and other businesses evolved to service the users of the canal, especially the people stopping at the lock nearby.

It wasn&#x27;t until the 20th century when the area first begin to be properly associated with gay people. By the 1950s, use of the canal had greatly declined due to competition from other methods of transport. Whilst assuming the form of an industrial area full of cotton factories, by night the area was a red-light district. With the collapse of the cotton industry in Northern England, the area suffered urban decay. The area along the canal was perfect for gay men to meet clandestinely as it was dark and unvisited, but was near to good transport links such as Oxford Road and Piccadilly railway stations.

In the 1980s, James Anderton, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, accused gays of &quot;swirling in a cesspit of their own making&quot; and, according to Beatrix Campbell, &quot;encouraged his officers to stalk its dank alleys and expose anyone caught in a clinch, while police motorboats with spotlights cruised for gay men around the canal&#x27;s locks and bridges&quot;. Anderton, when questioned about the policing of the Canal Street area, denied that he was motivated by anti-gay prejudice and was merely enforcing the law on sexual activity in public toilets. Greater Manchester Police under his leadership ran a strict licensing regime for bars and nightclubs in the central Manchester area. Anderton retired in 1991.

The opening of Manto (a gay bar) in 1990 was regarded as a catalyst for the development of many of the current style of bars and clubs in the Village. It was created when Carol Ainscow, a gay property developer, alongside her business partner Peter Dalton, bought a garage repair building on Canal Street. Unlike the other gay bars at that time, the building was the first in the area to be clad with large plate glass windows; allowing the casual passer-by to view what was going on inside. Previously, many establishments catering for the gay community were often keen to conceal activities from the general public, but the architectural design of Manto was seen as a queer visual statement of &quot;we&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re queer – get used to it&quot;, and a brick-and-mortar refusal to hide any more, or to remain underground and invisible. Ainscow stated, &quot;I felt sick of having to knock on doors and hide&quot;. Despite this, she stated that for the first six months of business, Manto was continually losing money due to people&#x27;s fear of being seen in there.

Another catalyst for the expansion in the 1990s was its official recognition by Manchester City Council. Following the passing of a number of non-discrimination policies on the grounds of sexuality in the late 1980s, the council was pioneering work in the advancement of lesbian and gay rights with a HIV/AIDS unit, sympathetic press and marketing officers like Chris Payne and Tony Cross, an Equality Group which appointed lesbians and gay men as officers - including Paul Fairweather, Marcus Woolley, Chris Root, Maggie Turner, Terry Waller and Mark Ovenden - to key departments like Libraries, Children&#x27;s Services and Housing and much official emphasis was placed on strengthening the community element of the Village. This included major support for the Mardi Gras, purchase of the Sackville Street Gardens in 1990, and becoming the first UK council to support civil partnerships.

The Village has been unified by issues regarding the gay community, such as Section 28 in the run-up to it becoming law in 1988 and the period thereafter. Ian Wilmott, a gay Labour councillor, said, &quot;Section 28 was such a monstrous attack on civil liberties that hundreds of campaigners came together to oppose it. People were feeling besieged. We had no homeland, no part of the city. We needed somewhere ... It had to be more than a club. We willed the village into existence.&quot; Additionally, raising awareness over the HIV/AIDS threat to the community was &quot;integral to bringing the village together&quot; according to John Hamilton, chair of the Village Business Association. This focus led to several of the pubs on or near Canal Street acquiring a predominantly gay clientele.

Over the next decade, more numerous and larger bars opened along the canal side, turning Canal Street into the centre of the most successful gay village in Europe, including Via Fossa, Velvet, Eden and AXM.

In 1999, Canal Street was bought to wider public view through its setting for the television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, and again in the 2001 series &quot;Bob &amp; Rose&quot;.

==Mainstream popularity==
This success led to a number of problems, however, with a resultant influx of straight drinkers including hen parties into the village and tensions amongst the existing LGBT community. Increasingly strict and cautious door policies on some bars attempted to keep some straight people out with questioning on the door to test for &quot;gayness&quot; however this also caused unintended consequences with some LGBT people being turned away. As the popularity of the village grew, so did problems of incoming crime.

In 2004 a boycott was launched against a new Slug and Lettuce bar by the village community because the chain refused to support Manchester Pride, eventually leading to its closure.

By 2006, concerns were being raised about falling revenues in the bars on Canal Street. In a 2013 article in &quot;Mancunian Matters&quot;, a community based web newspaper and webzine, Amy Lofthouse explored the change within Canal Street: &quot;For more than 20 years Canal Street has been viewed as the centre of the gay community in Manchester… but campaigners want to ensure dangerous stereotypes of it being a &#x27;gay ghetto&#x27; are left behind. With clubs, pubs and restaurants, the village has also become the focus of many a night out for students, hen parties and friends on a weekend away. This change however has not been welcomed by everyone on the street. Earlier in the year there was controversy over club door policies and there were fears that Canal Street’s role in the LGBT community was being diluted. Nowhere was the change in the Street shown more starkly than with the closure of Manto in October 2013. Manto was one of the most iconic bars in the area, having been a fixture on the street for 22 years. Manto&#x27;s re-opened in 2015 under a new name of ON Bar initially struggling it found its feet again in 2016 when the London owners head hunted Tony D Cooper from the successful Via further up Canal St.&quot; Lofthouse quotes Amelia Lee of LGBT Youth North West as feeling that Canal Street is over-emphasised as an all-encompassing gay area: &quot;It’s more for hen-do events than for LGBT people. I think it has grown too big and now needs to readjust and diversify to cater for more needs of the LGBT community.&quot;

This change in the types of clientele attending or moving in and out of the area in recent years is believed to have led to a number of homophobic attacks such as the one on Simon Brass, who was thrown into the canal and left to drown by a gang of muggers in June 2013.

In February 2015, gay activist Peter Tatchell added his voice to the debate about the changing nature of the area in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, saying &quot;It would be very wrong if there were unilateral attempts to change its character. I am all in favour of it evolving but it has to be with the agreement of the LGBTI community. As a society the need for specific gay districts may decline but we are not there yet. It would be a backward step to de-gay Canal Street.&quot;

==Redevelopment==
Further concerns for the future of the gay village have come about from redevelopment in and around the area. 800 &quot;upmarket&quot; homes are planned to be built overlooking Canal Street, and the existing community including bar owners running late licences fear that &quot;there will be untenable conflict of interest between future residents and longstanding LGBT establishments&quot;. There has been criticism of a &quot;lack of consultation&quot;, and tensions exacerbated by early developer plans referring to the area as &quot;Portland Village&quot; instead. Others believe that the area has lost its former attraction and finds itself &quot;at a crossroads&quot;.

Following a strategic review of the area in 2020, Manchester City Council, in partnership with Consultancy HATCH, launched the Manchester&#x27;s Gay Village Action Plan in 2024, which aims to &#x27;maintain, preserve and improve the LGBT quarter&#x27; based on consultation, feedback and further planned collaboration with the LGBT+ community.

<doc id="544837" wikidata="Q187981" url="?curid=544837" title="Ruffe">
<text>The ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua), also known as the Eurasian ruffe or pope, is a freshwater fish found in temperate regions of Europe and northern Asia. It has been introduced into the Great Lakes of North America, reportedly with unfortunate results, as it is invasive and is reproducing faster than other species. Its common names are ambiguous – &quot;ruffe&quot; may refer to any local member of its genus &quot;Gymnocephalus&quot;, which as a whole is native to Eurasia.

==Description==
The ruffe&#x27;s colors and markings are similar to those of the walleye, an olive-brown to golden-brown color on its back, paler on the sides with yellowish white undersides. The ruffe can reach up to in length, but is usually around half that size. It is a very aggressive fish for its size. The ruffe also has a large, spiny dorsal fin which is likely distasteful to its predators. It also has two fins on top, the front fin has hard and sharp spines, the back fin has soft spines called rays. The most obvious features to recognize a ruffe are the ruffe&#x27;s large, continuous dorsal fin and its slightly downturned mouth.

==Distribution==
The species occurs in the basins of the Caspian, Black, Aral, Baltic and North Sea, and is also found in Great Britain, parts of Scandinavia and some regions of the Arctic Ocean basin eastward to the drainage of the Kolyma. It has been introduced to parts of Western Europe (France, northern Italy) and Greece, as well as to the North American Great Lakes.

==Diet==
In Eurasia, the ruffe diet mainly consists of zoobenthos: chironomids, small aquatic bugs and larvae, which are all found in the benthic zone of the water column. As far as researchers have been able to learn, it has kept the same diet in its transfer to the Great Lakes. 

==Reproduction==
The ruffe has the capacity to reproduce at an extremely high rate. A ruffe usually matures in two to three years, but a ruffe that lives in warmer waters has the ability to reproduce in the first year of life. A single female has the potential to lay from 130,000 to 200,000 eggs annually. Ruffe will leave the deep dark water where they prefer and journey to warmer shallow water for spawning. The primary spawning season for the ruffe occurs from the middle of April through approximately June.

==Life cycle==
Life for the Eurasian ruffe, starts as an egg, like other fish. Egg sizes typically range from in diameter, depending on the size of the female. If the same female has a second batch in the same season, the eggs will be smaller than the first batch. The size of the second batch of eggs is about , while the first batch of eggs goes from in size. If the female lays twice in one season, there is usually one in late winter/early spring and one in late summer. Hatching occurs in 5–12 days in temperatures of .
The next stage in life is the embryonic/juvenile stage. Embryos that are freshly hatched are between in size. These embryos are sedentary for 3–7 days, and in that time grow to about in length. One week after the hatching, the young ruffe start to swim and feed actively; they do not form schools at this age.

From here, the ruffe gradually mature until they are 2–3 years old, when they reach full maturity. At full length, the adult ruffe is usually around , and a maximum of Growth usually occurs more when the ruffe is in clear, brackish waters. Generally, female and male ruffe do not live longer than 7 to 11 years.

==Presence in the North American Great Lakes area==

===Ecological effects===
The introduction of the ruffe seems to be causing much damage to Lake Superior. This fish&#x27;s invasion of the lake has not only caused problems with space, but competing with other fish for food supply. The ruffe has similar eating habits, but an accelerated reproduction rate compared to other similar fish. Therefore, having more ruffe in the water leads to less food for other fish. This fish is unique in its ability to adapt in many habitats and temperatures, resulting in success despite such factors as climate change or other biological changes. The ruffe also has an exceptional ability to detect water vibrations through organs called neuromasts. This trait both aids the ruffe in finding food and gives the ruffe an edge in avoiding predators. These develop into more advanced and sensitive organs as the fish matures; of note, the perch&#x27;s neuromasts weaken as it matures. The ruffe has the potential to overtake many other fish species, and consequently damage the Great Lakes&#x27; ecosystem. Without concerted intervention, the ruffe have the potential to ruin Lake Superior.

The ruffe is the first invasive species to have been classified as a nuisance by the Non-indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Program. Along with it being the most populous fish in the St. Louis river basin, it has disrupted ecosystems all across the Great Lakes. The invasion was first noticed in the 1980s by the DNR. They suggest that the fish was introduced to the lake via ballast water that was dumped into the Duluth, Minnesota, harbor by anchored freight ships. Ever since the ruffe were detected, studies have shown that the ruffe and the yellow perch are closely related and are quickly becoming rivals. The ruffe and perch are competing in numbers and are also competing for food; this is a match that the ruffe are winning.

===Control===
Ever since the ruffe was introduced into the Great Lakes system, scientists and fishery managers have been searching for the right way to get rid of them. In the beginning, the main method of control was to increase the Walleye and Northern Pike populations, because they are natural predators of the ruffe.

Other methods that have been considered are poison and chemical control. If a large school of ruffe is found, they can be poisoned. If some survive, however, they will rapidly reproduce. Chemicals can be targeted to act on specific species of fish. The chemical lampricide TFM kills ruffe, but leaves other fish unharmed.

As long as a couple of the fish survive, they can move and repopulate. The problem will increase if the ruffe invade southern river systems. The use of pheromones is being investigated as a control. After extensive studies, scientists discovered that the ruffe can be repelled by their own alarm pheromone. When injured, a ruffe will release this pheromone into the water to warn other ruffe to stay away.

Scientists have concluded three things: 
*The pheromone repels the ruffe (it was unclear if it would in the beginning). 
*The pheromone is species specific, so it would only repel the ruffe, none of the other fish. 
*The pheromone is resilient to freezing, so could be used even during Minnesota&#x27;s long winter season; the ruffe could still be controlled. By using this method, scientists could block ruffe from natural mating spots and produce a population decline; their goal is to kill the species in the Great Lakes.

==Other invasive situations==
Ruffe were first discovered in Loch Lomond, Scotland, in 1982, probably introduced as live bait by pike anglers. It is now abundant throughout the Loch. There are concerns about the effect of the huge ruffe population on the endemic whitefish population known as powan (&quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;) as ruffe prey on their eggs. Ruffe became the principal food item for the three main fish predators found in the area: the great cormorant, grey heron and northern pike.

<doc id="544840" wikidata="Q193651" url="?curid=544840" title="Hampden Park">
<text>Hampden Park ( ; Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Pàirc Hampden&quot;) is a football stadium in the Mount Florida area of Glasgow, Scotland, which is the national stadium of football in Scotland and home of the Scotland national football team, as well as Queen’s Park FC, the original owners. Hampden Park is owned by the Scottish Football Association (SFA), and regularly hosts the latter stages of the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. The largest stadium by capacity when opened in 1903, an accolade the stadium held until 1950, Hampden Park is the 11th-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom, and the second-largest football stadium in Scotland. The stadium retains all attendance records recorded in European football.

A UEFA category four stadium, Hampden Park has hosted six European finals including the 1960 European Cup final between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt which, with a crowd of 127,621 in attendance, is the highest ever recorded attendance for a European Cup final. The stadium houses the offices of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) and has hosted three European Cup/Champions League finals, two Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals and a UEFA Cup final. It has hosted other sporting events including the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2014 Commonwealth Games (also hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony). Scotland was one of the eleven host countries of the pan–European Euro 2020 tournament with the stadium hosting the round of 16 matches and will host matches of the upcoming Euro 2028, of which Scotland is again one of the host countries.

A stadium on the present site opened on 31 October 1903, with a capacity in excess of 100,000. This was increased between 1927 and 1937, reaching a peak of 150,000. The record attendance of 149,415, for Scotland v England in 1937, is the European record for an international football match. Tighter safety regulations meant that the capacity was reduced to 81,000 in 1977. The stadium has been fully renovated since then, with the most recent significant work being completed in 1999. Ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Hampden Park underwent modifications to the stadium to include a running track and other features required for hosting the games.

==History==
===Three Hampdens===

Queen&#x27;s Park, the oldest club in Scottish football, first played at a venue called Hampden Park on 25 October 1873. That ground was overlooked by a nearby terrace named after Englishman John Hampden, who fought for the roundheads in the English Civil War. It hosted the first Scottish Cup Final, played in 1874, and a Scotland v England match in 1878.

The club moved to the second Hampden Park, 150 yards from the original, because the Cathcart District Railway planned a new line through the site of the ground&#x27;s western terrace. A lawn bowling club at the junction of Queen&#x27;s Drive and Cathcart Road marks the site of the first Hampden. The second Hampden Park opened in October 1884. It became a regular home to the Scottish Cup Final, but Celtic Park shared some of the big matches including the Scotland v England fixture in 1894.

In the late 1890s, Queen&#x27;s Park requested more land for development of the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, which led to the club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen&#x27;s Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along the south side of the ground with a pavilion wedged in between. The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during the process, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed. In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.

Third Lanark A.C. took over the second Hampden Park in 1903 and renamed it Cathkin Park after their previous ground of the same name. The club rebuilt the ground from scratch due to a failure to agree a fee for the whole stadium which resulted in Queen&#x27;s Park removing the pavilion and other fittings (which they owned, while the ground itself was leased). During the first season following the move (1903–04, in which they finished as champions), Third Lanark played several of their home matches at the new Hampden while work was carried out on Cathkin Park. Third Lanark went out of business in 1967 and Cathkin Park is now a public park with much of the original terracing still evident.

In the stadium&#x27;s first match on 31 October 1903 Queen&#x27;s Park defeated Celtic 1–0 in the Scottish Football League, having played eight of their first nine league matches away from home and the other at the old Cathkin Park awaiting its opening. The first Scottish Cup Final played at the ground was an Old Firm match in 1904, attracting a record Scottish crowd of 64,672. The first Scotland v England match at the ground was played in April 1906 with 102,741 people in attendance, which established Hampden as the primary home of the Scotland team. Hampden Park was the biggest stadium in the world from the time of its opening until it was surpassed by the Maracanã in 1950. Along with Celtic Park and Ibrox, the city of Glasgow possessed the three largest football stadia in the world at the time Hampden opened.

===Record attendances===
Attendances continued to increase during the remainder of the 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match. The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000. After the second match there was a riot because there was confusion over what would happen next when the second match also ended in a draw. The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of extra time be played. The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden was not in a fit condition to host a second replay. In response to the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided to stop using Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue.

Queen&#x27;s Park conducted extensive ground improvements after the 1909 riot. A new world record of 127,307 were in attendance to see Scotland play England in 1912. A fire in 1914 destroyed the pavilion, which was replaced by a four-storey structure with a press box on the roof. The Scottish Cup Final returned to Hampden in 1920, when a large crowd of 95,000 saw Kilmarnock win the cup against Albion Rovers. Record crowds attended the 1925 Scottish Cup Final, a 5–0 win for Celtic against Rangers, and the 1927 Scotland v England match, England&#x27;s first win in the stadium. Hampden became the &quot;de facto&quot; sole venue of the Scottish Cup Final after 1925 and Queen&#x27;s Park purchased more land in 1923 to bring the total to 33 acres. 25,000 places were added to the terraces and rigid crush barriers were installed in 1927.

World record crowds attended Scotland matches against England in 1931 and 1933. In 1933, Austria, who had beaten Scotland 5–0 in Vienna in 1931, became the first foreign national side to visit Hampden Park. After intervention from the Glasgow Corporation in 1935 regarding public order and safety of the huge, ever-increasing crowds attending matches in the city, Queen&#x27;s Park and Hampden defeated a rival bid from Rangers and Ibrox – which itself already had a capacity well over 100,000 – to enlarge the ground at the expense of the club, in exchange for becoming the official venue for the Scotland v England fixture and the Cup Final (and collect a designated portion of gate receipts from these matches), while the city would provide improvements in transport provision and other infrastructure to support the regular influx of spectators to the venue. This work increased the official theoretical capacity of the ground to 183,388 in 1937, but the SFA were only allowed to issue 150,000 tickets for games. The 1937 Scotland v England match had an official attendance of 149,415, but at least 20,000 more people entered the ground without tickets. A week later the 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew an official crowd of 147,365, with 20,000 more people locked outside; this stood as a world record for a club match until 1963. The 1938 and 1939 cup finals were contested by provincial sides and did not test the new capacity, but the England match of 1939 attracted 149,269.

===Wartime===
During the Second World War, matches at heavily attended grounds were initially prohibited due to the fear of aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe. Scottish national league and cup competitions were suspended for the duration of the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their place. Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was the maximum permitted. The Parashots, a forerunner of the Home Guard, set up a command post at Lesser Hampden in 1940. A government official presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches be ploughed and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen&#x27;s Park committee chose to ignore the order and the government did not pursue it. Wartime internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5–4 on 18 April 1942.

===Post-war===
After the Second World War ended in 1945, Hampden started to host Scotland matches more frequently. Before then, Hampden had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria and Czechoslovakia. During the post-war attendance boom, Hampden was the only stadium big enough to host the crowds who wanted to see the team. Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being attended by nearly 100,000. A fire on 25 December 1945 destroyed the stadium press box and damaged offices. The press box was replaced with a plainer two-storey structure that overhung the pitch. The Hampden fixture list was also expanded by the new Scottish League Cup competition. In 1947, Rangers defeated Aberdeen in the first League Cup Final, a year after a 135,000 crowd watched the last edition of its wartime predecessor, the Southern League Cup, played between the same teams. The capacity of the ground was officially cut to 135,000 following the Burnden Park disaster in Bolton in March 1946, but before that reduction was confirmed, 139,468 watched the Scotland v England Victory International on 13 April of that year.

The re-entry of the Home Nations into FIFA in 1947 was marked by a match between a Great Britain and a Rest of Europe select on 10 May 1947. Great Britain won 6–1 and 130,000 people attended. Unusually, a league match between Third Lanark and Hibernian was played immediately afterwards at Hampden because Cathkin Park was undergoing repair work. The first FIFA World Cup qualification match played at Hampden was a 2–0 win for Scotland against Wales on 9 November 1949; this match was also part of the 1950 British Home Championship. The win appeared to guarantee Scotland qualification for the 1950 FIFA World Cup because the top two finishers in the Championship were offered places in the tournament, but the SFA decreed that they would only send a team if they were British champions. Scotland only needed a draw against England at Hampden to meet that condition but lost 1–0.

The Coronation Cup, a competition to mark the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, was held in Glasgow during May 1953. Four major clubs from each of Scotland and England were invited, with the Old Firm clubs playing their matches at Hampden. Celtic and Hibernian progressed to the final, and a crowd of 117,060 saw Celtic win 2–0.

Scotland hosted the Magical Magyars of Hungary in December 1954 in front of 113,506 fans. The Scots put up a good fight against one of the most outstanding teams in the world at the time, but eventually lost 4–2. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup by defeating Spain, including Luis Suarez, Ladislao Kubala and Alfredo Di Stéfano, at Hampden.

===1960s and 1970s===

Hampden hosted the 1960 European Cup Final; Real Madrid defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 with 130,000 people in attendance. Floodlights were installed at Hampden in 1961 and were inaugurated with a friendly match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers. The ground then also hosted the 1962 and 1966 finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The attendances for each of these finals was less than 50,000, and the SFA did not offer to host another European final until the 1976 European Cup Final, in which Bayern Munich defeated St Etienne. St Etienne believed that two of their efforts which hit the square crossbar and rebounded into play would have resulted in goals if it had been round, and the French club subsequently bought the goalposts and displayed them in their museum.

After Celtic won the 1967 European Cup Final, the home leg of their Intercontinental Cup tie against Racing Club was held at Hampden. Celtic won 1–0 at Hampden, but lost the tie after a play-off in Montevideo. In 1970, Celtic played in the semi-finals of the European Cup against English league champions, Leeds United. Celtic chose to move their home leg of the tie from their Celtic Park home to Hampden, which had a far greater capacity. A crowd of 136,505, a record for any match in UEFA competition, saw Celtic win 2–1 (3–1 on aggregate) to advance to the 1970 European Cup Final. Celtic also played European Cup ties against Ajax and Rosenborg at Hampden during the 1970s.

A fire was deliberately started in the south stand in October 1968, destroying offices, 1,400 seats and one of the team dressing rooms. The fire caused the 1968–69 Scottish League Cup Final to be postponed until April. By 1970 Hampden was starting to age as a stadium. Wembley had been revamped for the 1966 World Cup, while other major stadia were being constructed for tournaments. Public safety was emphasized after the Ibrox disaster of January 1971, when 66 spectators were crushed to death. A benefit match was played at Hampden, while the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 compelled stadium authorities to obtain licences from local officials, impose crowd segregation and restrict attendances. Pittodrie and Ibrox were converted into all-seater stadiums, while Hampden&#x27;s capacity was reduced to 81,000.

Scotland secured qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup at Hampden, with a 2–1 victory over Czechoslovakia. Kenny Dalglish scored the winning goal against England in 1976 by nutmegging Ray Clemence. In 1977, Scotland again won against Czechoslovakia to move towards qualification for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Scotland played a friendly match against world champions Argentina in 1979; the talented, 18-year-old Diego Maradona scored a goal in a 3–1 win for the visitors.

===1990s re–development===

During the late 1970s, it became apparent that the facilities at Hampden were in need of renewal. As an amateur club, Queen&#x27;s Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen&#x27;s Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept the stadium open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.

The first phase of the redevelopment involved the demolition of the North Stand, the concreting of all terraces and the building of a block of turnstiles around the upper section of the East Terrace. This work, begun in October 1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 million. A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million. Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at Hampden. In 1987, the square goalposts that had been used since the stadium opened were banned by FIFA.

After the cancellation of the annual Scotland v England fixture in 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield was about to be redeveloped without public funding. None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen&#x27;s Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.

The UK Government eventually provided a grant of £3.5 million in 1992, which allowed work to begin on a £12 million project to convert Hampden into an all-seater stadium. The last match played in front of the sloping terraces was the 1992 Scottish League Cup Final. Within a year, the east and north parts of the ground had been converted from terracing to seats, and the partially rebuilt Hampden was re-opened for a friendly match between Scotland and Netherlands on 23 March 1994. It was then also used for the later stages of the 1993–94 Scottish Cup competition. As the capacity of the old South Stand had been limited to 4,500, the total capacity of Hampden had been reduced to approximately 37,000. With Celtic Park also undergoing extensive redevelopment to become all-seater, Celtic spent the 1994–95 season groundsharing at Hampden, at a cost of £500,000 rent.

The final stage of the renovation began in November 1997, with its £59 million cost funded by the National Lottery. There was a cost overrun and a fraud squad investigated alleged financial irregularities. The South Stand was replaced and the stadium was re-opened for the 1999 Scottish Cup Final. The ground now has a capacity of . Queen&#x27;s Park retained ownership of the ground, with the SFA holding a lease that ran until 2020.

===Recent history===

Real Madrid were again victorious when Hampden Park hosted the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final, defeating Bayer Leverkusen, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the winning goal with a left-foot volley. Hampden then hosted the 2007 UEFA Cup Final and was one of the venues for football at the 2012 Summer Olympics, hosting three matches in the men&#x27;s tournament and five in the women&#x27;s tournament. One of the matches was delayed after the North Korean team protested against the flag of South Korea being used mistakenly to represent their players. Later in 2012, a Scotland women&#x27;s national football team game was played at Hampden for the first time, when it hosted the first leg of a European Championship qualifying playoff against Spain.

Hampden was temporarily converted into an athletics stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. It hosted its last international game before the conversion work on 15 November 2013 and Queen&#x27;s Park temporarily played their home games at the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie. Due to the works being carried out at the Olympic Stadium, the 2014 London Grand Prix was renamed the Glasgow Grand Prix and hosted by Hampden. The conversion works involved the removal of eight rows of seating, which reduced the capacity to 44,000. Hampden was converted back into a football stadium after the Commonwealth Games.

====SFA ownership====

With their lease on Hampden due to expire in 2020, the SFA canvassed opinion from its member clubs about where Scotland games should be played. In September 2018, the SFA announced an agreement to purchase Hampden from Queen&#x27;s Park. As part of the deal, Lesser Hampden was redeveloped and became the home stadium for Queen&#x27;s Park. As of August 2020, the SFA had taken ownership of Hampden and a new facility was under construction at Lesser Hampden. Queen&#x27;s Park played their last match at Hampden on 20 March 2021, as their lease expired at the end of that month. Queen&#x27;s Park are due to move back into Hampden for the 2023–24 season, having agreed a deal with the SFA to rent the stadium while allowing the Scotland national teams to use Lesser Hampden as a training pitch.

====UEFA Euro 2020====

In September 2014, Hampden was one of 13 venues chosen to host matches in the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament. It held three group games and one round of sixteen match, with attendances restricted to 25% of its capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
====World Cup bid and Euro 2028====

Architects drew up plans in 2020 for a major redevelopment of Hampden, but this was contingent on a 2030 World Cup bid that did not materialise. The SFA instead entered a five-nation bid to host some UEFA Euro 2028 games at Hampden, which was successful. In July 2023, the SFA registered its interest in hosting a European club final at Hampden in either 2026 or 2027.

==Hampden Roar==
The football match crowd at Hampden were renowned for creating the &quot;Hampden Roar&quot; and trying to terrify opposing teams. The stadium&#x27;s capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 1900s until the 1980s and the Roar could be heard whenever Scotland scored an important goal. After the renovation of the stadium and the reduced capacities, the roar has become more muted.

The Hampden Roar was first noticed in a game against England in 1929. Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, equalised in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick. The roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a mile away in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, could tell that Scotland had scored.

The phrase Hampden Roar is also used as rhyming slang; People from Glasgow may ask &quot;What&#x27;s the Hampden?&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s the score?&quot;, idiom for &quot;What&#x27;s happening / what&#x27;s going on?&quot;).

In April 2018, the stadium operating company commissioned a study into the noise levels produced at Hampden during an Old Firm match. This found a peak noise level of 115 decibels, after goals were scored, and 109 decibels when the teams first came onto the field. These findings were much higher than those recorded in a 2014 study of Premier League grounds (maximum of 84 decibels), but well short of the world record set by a National Football League match at the Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City (142 decibels).

==Structure and facilities==

Hampden is an all-seated bowl stadium, although the ground is split into four geographic sections, officially known as the North, East, South and West Stands. Due to the dominance of the Old Firm within Scottish football and their regular qualification for cup matches played at Hampden, the East and West stands are commonly known as the Celtic and Rangers ends. The East Stand has 12,800 seats on a single tier of 53 rows. The two end stands are up to 140 metres away from the pitch, due to Hampden retaining its bowl shape after it was redeveloped. This distance is almost as great as if Hampden included an athletics track, although the distance between the pitch and the two side stands is more comparable to a normal football stadium.

The South Stand is the main stand of the stadium, as it holds the technical areas, dressing rooms, indoor warm-up area, executive boxes, lounges and media facilities. It has been sponsored by BT Scotland since 1998. The South Stand is also the only part of the stadium split into two tiers, although there is also a small gallery above the North Stand that has 290 seats and access to lounges. The North Stand accommodates 9,100 spectators in 46 rows. The total capacity of the stadium is . The capacity was temporarily reduced to 44,000 for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, as the running track raised the field level by 1.9 metres.

The redeveloped Hampden has held the top status with the various UEFA stadium categories, holding category four status. The Scottish Football Museum, which opened in 2001, is located within Hampden. Part of the museum is the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. A distinctive feature of the old Hampden, the press box which sat on the roof of the old South Stand, is also exhibited at the museum. The offices of the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish Professional Football League are located within Hampden.

Lesser Hampden is a football stadium located immediately beside the western end of Hampden Park. The ground was constructed in the early 1920s after additional ground was purchased to expand the main stadium. Queen&#x27;s Park proposed in 1990 to sell off Lesser Hampden to fund redevelopment works on the main stadium, but this was rejected by planners. Lesser Hampden was refurbished for use as a warm-up area during the 2014 Commonwealth Games. When the SFA took ownership of Hampden, new stands were constructed at Lesser Hampden for it to be used again as a football stadium.

==Other uses==

===Sports other than football===


Hampden Park has held four full rugby union international matches. The first was in 1906, when the Scottish Rugby Union chose to play their match against the touring South Africans at Hampden because no rugby ground could satisfy the demand to see the visitors. A crowd of over 30,000 saw Scotland win 6–0. The redeveloped Hampden served as one of the 1999 Rugby World Cup venues, over 90 years later. Scotland played Romania in a friendly match before the tournament and South Africa played Uruguay in a tournament pool match. The only rugby union international played at Hampden since then was in November 2004, between Scotland and Australia.

Hampden also hosted a club rugby union match between Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby on 22 December 2024, the first leg of their tie in the United Rugby Championship and 1872 Cup. Glasgow triumphed 33-14 in front of 27,538 fans, a Warriors home record.

Hampden hosted the Scottish Amateur Athletics Association championships during the 1920s and 1930s, with the original Meadowbank Stadium used as an alternative venue. Eric Liddell won the 110, 220 and 440 yard dashes in the 1924 championship. His last competition in Britain was the 1925 championship, when he won the 220 yards race for a record fifth time. Hampden was temporarily converted to stage the athletics events for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. It was also used for the closing ceremony.

Suzanne Lenglen, the French professional tennis player, played an exhibition match against Vivian Dewhurst at Hampden in 1927. A crowd of 10,000 saw that match and another between male players Howard Kinsey and Karel Koželuh.

During the Second World War, American armed forces based in Scotland played games of softball, baseball and American football at Hampden. American football returned to Hampden in 1998, when the NFL Europe team Scottish Claymores shared home games between Hampden and Murrayfield. World Bowl XI was held at Hampden in 2003, but after the 2004 season the Claymores folded and were replaced by the Hamburg Sea Devils.

Hampden was the home of the Glasgow Tigers speedway team from 1969 until 1972. Poor crowds, escalating costs and the refusal of the city council to allow music to be played at events contributed to the team moving to Cliftonhill, in Coatbridge. Glasgow Tigers&#x27; Svein Kaasa was killed during a race at Hampden Park on 29 September 1972.

The redeveloped Hampden was the venue for a boxing card headlined by former world champion Mike Tyson in June 2000. Tyson knocked down Lou Savarese after just 12 seconds of the fight, which the referee stopped after 38 seconds. The fight ended in farce as the referee, who had been attempting to separate the two fighters, was also knocked down by Tyson. The disappointed crowd booed Tyson out of the ring, while former fighters Jim Watt and Barry McGuigan criticised his actions. After the fight, Tyson claimed that he wanted to eat the children of world champion Lennox Lewis, which also drew criticism.

===Uses other than sport===
The 50th anniversary Conventicle of the Boys&#x27; Brigade, which had been founded in Glasgow by William Alexander Smith, was staged at Hampden in 1933. 130,000 people were inside the ground, while another 100,000 stood outside singing Psalms. American evangelical Christian missionary Billy Graham had an &quot;All Scotland Crusade&quot; during the spring of 1955. The major outdoor event of the tour was at Hampden, where a crowd of 100,000 heard him speak.

====Concerts====
Genesis and Paul Young performed in the first concert at Hampden, in 1987. The Rolling Stones played there in 1990, during their Urban Jungle Tour. Since the redevelopment of Hampden was completed in 1999, many acts have performed there, including The Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, Rod Stewart, Bon Jovi, Eagles, Oasis, George Michael, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Diamond, Take That, AC/DC, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay, Pink, Paul McCartney, Rihanna, The Stone Roses, Gerry Cinnamon and Beyoncé. The damage caused to the Hampden pitch by a U2 concert in August 2009 forced a Queen&#x27;s Park league match to be postponed. Ed Sheeran was the first act in history to perform at the Hampden three times on a single tour.

==Records==

The highest attendance recorded at Hampden for a football match was 149,415, for a 1937 British Home Championship tie between Scotland and England. This is still a European record for an international match. The 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew an official crowd of 147,365, a world record for a club match, with 20,000 more people locked outside. Hampden set world attendance records that year which have only been surpassed by the Maracanã, and it still holds all the major European records. The European Cup match between Celtic and Leeds United in 1970 was attended by 136,505, which is a UEFA competition record.

Since the redevelopment of Hampden was completed in 1999, the capacity for sporting events is now limited to . Attendances for concerts can be higher than this as people are allowed onto the pitch area. In 2009, more people attended concerts at Hampden than football matches. While Queen&#x27;s Park played at the ground, Hampden regularly had crowds of below 1,000 for their matches in the lower divisions of the Scottish football league system.

==Transport==

The nearest railway stations are Mount Florida and King&#x27;s Park. Both stations are served by trains from Glasgow Central on the Cathcart Circle Lines. First Glasgow operate several bus routes in the area surrounding Hampden. There is a stadium car park immediately behind the south stand, but for major events this is only available to permit holders.

<text>James Earl Lawson, (October 21, 1891 – May 13, 1950) was a Canadian politician and lawyer.

Lawson was twice a candidate for the leadership of the Ontario Conservative Party, despite never being a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and once as a candidate for the federal Tory leadership.

His first run for the provincial leadership was in 1920 but was defeated by George Howard Ferguson.

He moved on to federal politics and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative MP in a 1928 by-election representing York West. Lawson was appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett in August 1935 as Minister of National Revenue. He lost this position when the Conservatives were defeated in the fall 1935 election but he was elected to the House of Commons, this time representing York South.

Lawson was the &quot;old guard&quot; candidate at the 1938 Conservative leadership convention but placed last after many of his delegates decided to support M. A. MacPherson in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Robert James Manion from becoming leader.

In 1938, several months following his failed attempt to win the federal leadership, he placed second to George Drew at the Ontario party&#x27;s provincial leadership convention.

Lawson retired from the House of Commons in 1940, but remained active in the party. He was the mover of the successful 1942 motion to change the name of the Conservative Party to the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

<doc id="544844" wikidata="Q2959330" url="?curid=544844" title="Charles Cahan">
<text>Charles Hazlitt Cahan (October 31, 1861 – August 15, 1944) was a Canadian lawyer, newspaper editor, businessman, and provincial and federal politician.

==Biography==
Cahan, a Presbyterian of Irish descent, was born in Hebron, Nova Scotia. He was the son of Charles Cahan Jr. and had three siblings: Frank D. Cahan (1863–1936), Jennie M. Cahan (1866–1918) and Loie S. Cahan (1871–1881).

He was educated at Yarmouth Seminary and Dalhousie University. He married Mary J. Hetherington of Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1887; she died in July 1914. In January 1918, he married Juliette Elisa Charlotte Hulin of Paris, France. Cahan had two sons, John Flint Cahan (1889–1928) and Charles H. Cahan, Jr. (1887–1970), and one daughter, Lois Theresa (1891–1964).

Cahan died on August 15, 1944, and is buried at Riverside Cemetery, in Hebron, Nova Scotia.

==Career==
Cahan was chief editorial writer of the &quot;Halifax Herald and Mail&quot; from 1886 to 1894. He was called to the bar in Nova Scotia in 1893 and in Quebec Bar in 1907, designated KC in 1907 (Nova Scotia) and 1909 (Quebec). He practiced corporate law in Halifax as a partner at Harris, Henry &amp; Cahan from 1893 to 1908, and in Montreal, Quebec, from 1908.

In private business, Cahan was a lawyer and financier for extensive tramway operations in South America, Trinidad and Mexico. In 1902, Cahan became the general counsel and on-site manager of the Mexican Light and Power Company Limited.

===Politics===
From 1890 to 1894, Cahan was a leader of the Liberal-Conservative Party in Nova Scotia Legislature and a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature for Shelbourne. He also served as Hon. Secretary, Halifax Branch, Imperial Federation League, Hon. Secretary, Liberal-Conservative Association, Nova Scotia, and Director of Public Safety for Canada during World War I.

In his article, &quot;The Role of Lawyers in Corporate Promotion and Management: A Canadian Case Study and Theoretical Speculations&quot; (see link below), Marchildon states, &quot;With his four-year arts degree, as well as a law degree from the Dalhousie Law School in Halifax, Charles Cahan was one of the few formally educated practitioners in late nineteenth century Canada. This gave Cahan flexibility and, rather than immediately pursuing a legal career, he worked first as a newspaper editor and then became a politician. Only when he was electorally defeated in 1896 did he turn to the practice of law.&quot;

Between 1887 and 1891, an attempt by Cahan and others to secure a federal civil service appointment for John James Stewart, owner of the &quot;Halifax Herald and Mail&quot;, came to nothing. Cahan attributed this result to the influence of Sir Charles Tupper and his son, Charles Hibbert Tupper, who were critics of &quot;Herald&quot; policies.

In 1901, Cahan managed the provincial campaign for his business associate, John Fitzwilliam Stairs who was the leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal-Conservative Union and a former Conservative house leader.

Cahan was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1925 election as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament in the riding of St. Lawrence—St. George, and was re-elected on four consecutive occasions, serving in the House of Commons until 1940. He served as Secretary of State of Canada in the 1930–1935 cabinet of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett.

He was a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership at the 1927 Conservative leadership convention, finishing in third place. Cahan&#x27;s policies were clearly ahead of their time, as in a review of Glassford&#x27;s book, &quot;Reaction and Reform: The Politics of the Conservative Party under R.B. Bennett, 1927–1938&quot;, it is stated, &quot;The title of the book is most clearly revealed, perhaps, in the conflicts within the party that Bennett was unable to resolve. Glassford&#x27;s party had three parts: the populists led by H.H. Stevens; C.H. Cahan&#x27;s rugged individualists; and Bennett&#x27;s paternalistic Conservatives somewhere in between. In the end Bennett cast Stevens aside, rugged individualism seemed a pitiful response to the Depression, and the radical tone of Bennett&#x27;s rendering of paternal conservatism was branded either as heresy or a cynical power grab...In the epilogue, after racing through Tory leaders since Bennett, he states that with the election of Brian Mulroney, &#x27;the old struggle between reaction and reform had taken an interesting twist. Under the imported titles of Thatcherism and Reaganomics, the laisser-faire principles of C.H. Cahan acquired a whole new respectability, though it is doubtful that many in the party had ever heard of him.&#x27; &quot;

In 1927, Cahan advocated for an independent Supreme Court of Canada, but stated, &quot;We must give to our own Supreme Court a higher standing, and create greater confidence in its decisions on the part of the people of this country before we can abrogate the right of appeal to the Privy Council.&quot; After having publicly lamented that the poor quality of the Supreme Court prevented the abrogation of appeals, in the late 1930s he attacked the Privy Council&#x27;s interpretation of the BNA Act and demanded the end of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Like many Canadian legal scholars, Cahan believed that the Privy Council had deliberately attempted to alter the true meaning of the Canadian Constitution. He concluded that members of the Privy Council were &quot;personally ignorant&quot; of Canada yet arrogated &quot;to themselves a prescience and clairvoyance which entitles them to substitute their judgments and even their personal preferences, for the deliberate legislative enactments of the elected representatives of the people who sit in the parliament of Canada&quot;. Cahan introduced a bill, in 1939, to abolish appeals and, after the bill received considerable support in Parliament, the Minister of Justice, Ernest Lapointe, referred it to the Supreme Court, thus affording the Court an opportunity to adjudicate its own pre-eminence. The Court found that it was within the Dominion government&#x27;s authority to end appeals to the Privy Council unilaterally without the approval of the provinces. The government postponed the implementation of the legislation until after the Second World War, and after an unsuccessful appeal to the Privy Council of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. Finally, in 1949, the government enacted legislation establishing that new litigation could not be appealed to the Privy Council.

In 1929, Cahan moved in the House of Commons that a special committee be formed to reconsider the 1919 Nickle Resolution, which had marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy forbidding the British and, later, Canadian Sovereign from granting knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians, and set the precedent for later policies prohibiting Canadians from accepting or holding titles of honour from Commonwealth or foreign countries. He noted that the Nickle Resolution favoured foreign sovereigns over Canada&#x27;s own sovereign because, since 1919, some 646 foreign orders had been conferred upon persons living in Canada by foreign, non-British sovereigns. The vote on Charles Cahan&#x27;s motion, on February 14, showed that Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Conservative leader of the opposition, Richard B. Bennett, both voted &quot;yea&quot; with Charles Cahan, but the motion was defeated.[6]

Relations between Canada&#x27;s religious communities was an important issue that Cahan had to deal with as Secretary of State. As stated by McEvoy in &quot;Religion and Politics in Foreign Policy: Canadian Government Relations with the Vatican&quot;, &quot;Cahan, though a Presbyterian, had forged close contacts with the Catholic clergy both in his native Nova Scotia and later in Quebec. He had come to the conclusion that domestic peace in Canada was largely dependent upon the happiness of the French Canadian people and clergy. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown to him, he now found them in June 1931 &#x27;disposed to be anxious and sorrowful&#x27; and felt strongly that everything possible should be done to alleviate their discontent. Finding Bennett unwilling to intervene, Cahan wrote on his own responsibility to the British Chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Holy See, George Ogilvie-Forbes, requesting him to raise the matter delicately at the Vatican, an initiative approved by Archbishop Gauthier of Montreal...In September 1931 Ogilvie-Forbes told Cahan that &quot;the subject of your last letter has reached the proper and highest quarters.&#x27; &quot;

Cahan also had to deal with problems of precedence within the Catholic community. At a state dinner following the opening of Parliament in January 1934, Cardinal Villeneuve was ranked behind the apostolic delegate and the Archbishop Forbes of Ottawa, who had seniority as an archbishop. Villeneuve, who considered himself as head of the church in Canada, refused to attend the dinner. The incident was covered by the press and Cahan, who was the responsible minister, offered to resign. As stated by McEvoy, &quot;To Cahan, a contented French-Canadian clergy could help ensure domestic peace in Canada&quot;.
As Secretary of State of Canada, Charles Cahan was a Canadian delegate to the League of Nations in 1932, at which he gave a speech on Canada&#x27;s position with respect to the dispute between Japan and China. This speech provoked a minor political incident due to what was taken to be Canada&#x27;s implicit recognition of Japan&#x27;s occupation of China. The speech prompted an arguably prescient critique at the Empire Club of Canada by W.L. Grant entitled, &quot;Does Canada Take the League of Nations Seriously&quot;.

Cahan lost his seat in the 1940 general election.

===Awards and honors===
Cahan was a guest speaker at the Empire Club of Canada in 1919 on the subject of propaganda, and in 1929 on the subject of constitutional issues. In 1939, he was a guest speaker at the Canadian Club of Ottawa in 1939 on the subject of Pan-American relations.

Cahan was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dalhousie University in 1919. He is a member of the Nova Scotia Railway Hall of Fame.

<doc id="544846" wikidata="Q1073993" url="?curid=544846" title="Masayuki Suo">
<text>is a Japanese film director. He is best known for his two Japan Academy Prize-winning films, &quot;Sumo Do, Sumo Don&#x27;t&quot; (1992) and &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (1996).

==Life and career==
In 1982, along with filmmakers Yoshiho Fukuoka, Itsumichi Isomura, Toshiyuki Mizutani and Akira Yoneda, Suo founded a production company called Unit 5. Suo worked as an assistant director and appeared in the cast of Kiyoshi Kurosawa&#x27;s directorial debut, the pink film &quot;Kandagawa Pervert Wars&quot; (1983). At this early stage in his career, Suo also wrote scripts for the pink film genre, such as &quot;Scanty Panty Doll: Pungent Aroma&quot; (1983). Suo first film as director was also in the pink film genre: &quot;Abnormal Family: Older Brother&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1984), a film designed as a tribute and satire of Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;. In his book on the pink film, &quot;Behind the Pink Curtain&quot; (2008), Jasper Sharp calls &quot;Abnormal Family: Older Brother&#x27;s Bride&quot; an early masterpiece, and one of the wittiest films ever made in the genre. Suo not only pokes gentle fun at Ozu&#x27;s story, but also mimics many of his stylistic techniques, such as shooting his actors from a low, &quot;tatami&quot;-mat angle, stiff and static characters speaking to each other with mis-matched eye-angles, and a simple, sentimental melody which accompanies the film. In the years since its release, the film has amused film students with the activity of locating and identifying Suo&#x27;s many nods to Ozu and his &quot;oeuvre&quot;. &quot;Abnormal Family&quot; was Suo&#x27;s only directorial work in the pink film genre.

He next worked for Juzo Itami, to film &quot;making of&quot; pieces for that director&#x27;s &quot;A Taxing Woman&quot; (1987) and &quot;A Taxing Woman 2&quot; (1988). He made his regular feature film debut with &quot;Fancy Dance&quot; in 1989, and won the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Award for his next feature, &quot;Sumo Do, Sumo Don&#x27;t&quot;, in 1991.

Suo&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; won fourteen awards at the Japanese Academy Awards including Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Film and performed strongly in U.S. theaters. In 2006, Suo directed &quot;I Just Didn&#x27;t Do It&quot;, a legal film starring Ryo Kase. It was followed by the 2012 medical-themed film &quot;A Terminal Trust&quot;. His musical film, &quot;Lady Maiko&quot;, screened at the 2014 Shanghai International Film Festival.

==Style and influences==
In a 1997 interview with IndieWire, Suo talked about his filmmaking style:&quot;The most important thing for me in movie making is to love the characters of the movie, so even though you only have a few seconds with a character, that person has to have his own life. Therefore, I want to respect it, I want to make movies where each character has his own individuality.&quot;

<doc id="544849" wikidata="Q728201" url="?curid=544849" title="Benjamin Creme">
<text>Benjamin Creme (5 December 1922 − 24 October 2016) was a Scottish artist, esoteric writer, and editor of &quot;Share International&quot; magazine.

Creme asserted that the Second Coming, prophesied by many religions, would come in the form of Maitreya, the World Teacher. Maitreya is the name Buddhists use for the future Buddha, but Creme believed that Maitreya is the teacher that all religions point towards and hope for. Creme maintained that Maitreya had returned in a physical form, descended from the Himalayas, and then moved to London on 19 July 1977.

==Early life==

Born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1922, Benjamin Creme’s life and work followed two distinct interests – art and esotericism – which eventually merged as a single path. At the age of thirteen Creme began painting, inspired by the works of Rembrandt. In order to become a painter, he left school at sixteen. Over the years, Creme befriended and collaborated with many fixtures of the time in British art, music, and literature, developing into a painter in the Modernist style. His style of painting has also been categorized as &quot;abstractly representational&quot;, and his work has been exhibited by galleries around the world.

==Spiritual interests==
In direct parallel to his artistic exploration, Creme said he became interested in the occult at the age of fourteen, when he read &quot;With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet&quot; by Alexandra David-Neel. Over the years, Creme studied the works of Helena Blavatsky and Alice Bailey, as well as those of Charles Webster Leadbeater, Paul Brunton, George Gurdjieff, Peter Ouspensky and Maurice Nicoll; along with Patanjali, Vivekananda, Sivananda, Yogananda, Krishnamurti, and Ramana Maharshi, all of whom described the existence of a kingdom beyond that of the Human. Creme reiterated that it was this Spiritual Kingdom, or Fifth Kingdom on Earth, that has helped guide human evolution since Humanity’s inception. Creme explained further about how this Kingdom, or Spiritual Hierarchy, is composed of Masters of Wisdom – great beings who have mastered themselves over many life-times.

Creme said that he was first contacted telepathically by his Master in January 1959, when Creme was asked to make tape recordings of his Master&#x27;s messages. Creme first began to speak publicly of his mission on 30 May 1975, at the Friends Meeting House on Euston Road in London, England. His central message announced the emergence of this group of enlightened spiritual teachers who would guide humanity forward into a new epoch, the Aquarian Age of peace and brotherhood, based on the principles of love and sharing. At the head of this group would be the one who occupies the office of the Christ, &quot;Maitreya&quot;, the World Teacher, expected by all the major religions as their &quot;Awaited One&quot;: the Christ to the Christians; the Imam Mahdi to the Muslims; the Messiah for Jews; and the 5th Buddha (i.e., &quot;Maitreya&quot;) for Buddhists. As early as 1982, however, Creme emphasized that Maitreya would reveal himself fully only when Humanity began to live in right relationship to one another – most notably, by living in peace, and by beginning to share the world’s resources more equitably.

== Predictions in 1982 and later ==
In the spring of 1982 Creme placed advertisements in newspapers around the world saying, &quot;The Christ is now here.&quot; According to Creme, the Christ, whom he also called Maitreya, would be beginning to announce his existence on worldwide television broadcasts. Creme then stated in these newspaper advertisements that the Second Coming of Christ was to occur within the next two months. These series of announcements culminated on 14 May 1982, when Creme held a press conference in Los Angeles where more than 90 reporters attended. Creme alerted those present that Maitreya was then living within the Asian community in the Brick Lane area of London. Creme also underscored the importance of humanity&#x27;s involvement in these happenings (as humanity&#x27;s freewill is viewed by higher spiritual beings as sacrosanct). Thus Creme presented the reporters with this challenge: If the media made a serious attempt to research the story and locate Maitreya in London, Maitreya would reveal himself to them. Afterwards, Creme would report, &quot;It was hoped that the media would respond to my information at a level which would allow Him to come forward to them. This hope, however, was not fulfilled. While the media did show an interest in the reappearance story, it did not go so far as to actually get involved in searching for Maitreya.&quot;

After 1982, Creme made a number of additional predictions and announcements about the advent of Maitreya, based on his claims of receiving telepathic messages from a Master of Wisdom. Creme said that in January 1986, Maitreya contacted media representatives at the highest level in Britain who agreed to make an announcement about Maitreya&#x27;s existence and stature. Under pressure from high religious and government officials, however, these statements were withheld.

Nonetheless, Creme wrote, &quot;On 26 February 1987 Maitreya gave an interview to the major American television company, Cable News Network (CNN). He was interviewed under His ordinary, everyday name, and did not call Himself the Christ. He did say, however, that, among other names, He was known as Maitreya. A group of His closest associates journeyed to the United States to arrange further interviews[...]&quot; The CNN interview was made available for possible showing in 26 of a promised 29 countries in Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa and the Middle East, but was not broadcast in the United States. The CNN office in Atlanta maintained that they could not see a framework in which to present the interview.

In 1997 Creme again announced that there would be additional, global TV broadcasts from the Christ, although the media remained largely uninterested. Creme nevertheless asserted that there would be a &quot;Day of Declaration&quot;: &quot;The Christ will come on the world&#x27;s television channels, linked together by satellite. All those with access to television will see ... [his face]. He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously. While the Christ is speaking... [everyone will feel far more love than they&#x27;ve ever felt before, that massive outpouring of love will cause] hundreds of thousands of &#x27;miracle&#x27; cures [to] take place simultaneously.&quot;

On 14 January 2010 Creme said that Maitreya had given the first interview which aired on American television. Soon afterwards, several people in the United States working from Creme&#x27;s predictions concluded that the British-American economist and author Raj Patel was Maitreya. After newspaper articles spread this story around the world Creme responded that Raj Patel was not the coming World Teacher in an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; under the headline &quot;Raj Patel is Not Maitreya, But the World Teacher is Here — and Needed.&quot;

Creme gave lectures around the world for more than 30 years about Maitreya, and a network of volunteers worked with him to give his views to the public. In speaking about his work, Creme said: &quot;My job has been to make the initial approach to the public, to help create a climate of hope and expectancy. If I can do that, I&#x27;ll be well pleased.&quot;

Although most press coverage of Creme and his information has been skeptical, some members of the news media had positive views of him, such as Canadian broadcasting host/producer Max Allen, who stated, &quot;The Maitreya story is important and Creme is an admirable spokesman.&quot; Creme died in October 2016 at the age of 93.

==Crop circles and UFOs==
From 1957 to 1959 Creme was the vice-president of the Aetherius Society, an organization that maintained that UFOs existed and that the other planets in our solar system were inhabited and supported life, although Humanity had yet to develop etheric sight to ascertain this. The organization&#x27;s beliefs were based largely on Theosophy, which integrates the study of religion, philosophy, and science, branching not merely into the Occult but also cosmology. For Theosophists, planets are evolving, living beings that host their own Spiritual Hierarchies.

In 1958, Creme met George Adamski and said he could personally vouch for the authenticity of Adamski&#x27;s UFO contacts. Creme maintained that most of the UFOs that travelled to Earth came from Mars and Venus, in space-ships manufactured on Mars through a process in which thoughts have the power to materialize things. In addition, Creme believed that the most highly evolved beings of Mars and Venus (that are visible only on the etheric level) have long played a role in not merely uplifting early animal-man, but also in protecting Humanity from its own self by sending UFOs to heal the Earth’s negativity and pollution. Creme asserted that nuclear radiation was the most dangerous of all pollution, while emphasizing that all the nuclear power plants continually leak, but such seepage escapes scientific measurements at this time as radioactive pollution exists largely on the etheric plane. Creme underscored that it is there that the radioactive waste does the most harm; it is in that realm that nuclear power threatens all life on our planet and beyond.

During an interview in 2006 Creme confirmed his views on the importance of UFOs and their role in creating crop circles. &quot;The crop circles are there to draw attention to the fact that the Space Brothers are there... They are made in seconds by the &#x27;ships&#x27; of the Space Brothers...They appear all over the world, but the majority are in the South of England. Why? Because Maitreya is in London.&quot; 

Over time, Creme explained how interdependent Humanity&#x27;s existence has been with other, far more advanced, planetary civilizations. He underscored that &quot;the UFOs have an enormous part to play in the security of this planet at the ecological level. [The crop circles are part of] a new science that will give us energy directly from the sun. Oil will become a thing of the past. No one will be able to sell energy in the future.&quot;

==Predictions and responses==
Creme asserted that Maitreya was the World Teacher for the Age of Aquarius, and that during the transition of one astrological cycle to another humans undergo a quickening of their evolution, while experiencing crisis after crisis. Creme underscored that Maitreya &quot;comes to show that the spiritual life can be lived in every department of human living ―  not alone in the religious field; that the scientific path to God, about which he will teach, is wide enough and varied enough to accommodate all men. Everyone, in the future, will come to realize the spiritual basis of life, and will seek to give it expression in his work. And whereas today only the seer or the mystic knows the true meaning of reality, this will be the experience of all men, whatever their way. Not all men are religious; religion is a way, a specific way.&quot;  

Between 1989 and 1991, Creme&#x27;s magazine &quot;Share International&quot; published a series of purported excerpts of talks given by Maitreya in the London area, recorded by a close associate, and then transmitted to two journalists, Patricha Pitchon and Brian James. Covering modern problems such as addiction, crime, and corruption, Maitreya&#x27;s dialogues proposed the technique of &quot;honesty of mind, sincerity of spirit and detachment&quot; as the cure, leading to growing awareness. The excerpts also contained prognostications of ongoing world events, including the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the ending of Communist rule in the Soviet Union, the release of Nelson Mandela and the ending of Apartheid in South Africa, the release of Terry Waite, the resignation of Margaret Thatcher, and many more. 

Sceptics ridiculed the story presented by Benjamin Creme, noting that several of the predictions were incorrect. Some fundamentalist Evangelical Christian sources and other detractors accused Creme of being part of a satanic conspiracy and placed him among a number of &quot;antichrist potentials&quot;. Yet Creme emphasized that those who read his own books or listened to his lectures would do best to engage actively with the information he presented, and to verify it for themselves. Creme stated,  &quot;I have never presented Maitreya as a messiah figure who comes to make all things bright and beautiful for a supine humanity. Maitreya himself is at pains to clarify his position that every stone and brick of the new civilisation must be put in place by humanity itself; humanity&#x27;s free will is sacrosanct.&quot;

<text>Robert Rogers, (2 March 1864 – 21 July 1936) was a Canadian merchant and politician. He served as a cabinet minister at the federal and provincial levels.

Rogers was born in Lakefield Canada East (now Gore, Quebec), the son of Lieutenant-Colonel George Rogers. He was educated in Lachute, Berthier and Montreal, and later moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba to become director of the Monarch Life Assurance Company. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England.

== Manitoba politics ==
He contested Lisgar in the 1896 federal election as a candidate of the federal Conservative Party, and lost to Liberal Robert Lorne Richardson by fifty-four votes. He was 32 years old.

Rogers was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1899 provincial election as a Conservative candidate, defeating Liberal candidate J.L. Brown by twenty-eight votes in Manitou. The Conservatives won this election, and Rogers sat in the legislature as a backbench supporter of Hugh John Macdonald&#x27;s administration. When Rodmond Roblin succeeded Macdonald as premier on 29 October 1900, he appointed Rogers as a minister without portfolio.

On 20 December 1900, Rogers was promoted to the powerful position of Minister of Public Works. He remained in this position for eleven years, and was often regarded as the second most powerful figure in Roblin&#x27;s cabinet, helping the premier construct an effective patronage network. He was re-elected without difficulty in the campaigns of 1903, 1907 and 1910.

== Federal politics ==
Rogers turned to federal politics in 1911. The federal Conservative Party under Robert Borden defeated Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s governing Liberals in the 1911 federal election, due in part to assistance from Roblin&#x27;s electoral machine in Manitoba. Although Rogers was not a candidate in the election, he was appointed as Canada&#x27;s Minister of the Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs on 10 October 1911. Seventeen days later, he was acclaimed to the House of Commons in a by-election for Winnipeg.

Rogers was given additional responsibilities as Minister of Mines on 30 March 1912. On 29 October 1912, he left his other portfolios to become Canada&#x27;s Minister of Public Works, a position which he held for five years. He did not seek re-election in 1917.

He attempted to return to the House of Commons for Lisgar in the 1921 election, but lost to Progressive candidate John Livingstone Brown by 1,164 votes.

Rogers was returned to parliament in the 1925 election, defeating former Liberal premier Tobias Norris by 1,617 votes in Winnipeg South. In the following year&#x27;s election, he lost his seat to Liberal John Stewart McDiarmid by 1,171 votes.

He was a candidate at the Conservative Party leadership convention in 1927. He finished fifth out of six candidates. His vote mostly vanished in the second vote – the leader was elected through run-off voting. His lack of French ended his drive for the leadership.

Rogers won election to the House of Commons for a third time in the 1930 election, defeating McDiarmid by 343 votes. He was not included in the cabinet of Conservative prime minister Richard Bennett, and retired from politics in 1935. He died the following year.

<doc id="544861" wikidata="Q1143552" url="?curid=544861" title="Silver Lake, Los Angeles">
<text>Silver Lake is a residential and commercial neighborhood in the east-central region of Los Angeles, California, United States, originally home to a small community called Ivanhoe, so named in honor of the 1819 novel by Walter Scott. In 1907, the Los Angeles Water Department built the Silver Lake Reservoir, named for LA Water Commissioner Herman Silver, giving the neighborhood its name. The area is now known for its architecturally significant homes, independently owned businesses, diverse restaurants, painted staircases, and creative environment.

==Geography and climate==
Silver Lake is flanked on the northeast by Atwater Village and Elysian Valley, on the southeast by Echo Park, on the southwest by Westlake, on the west by East Hollywood and on the northwest by Los Feliz.

Street and other boundaries are: the Los Angeles River between Glendale Boulevard and Fletcher Drive and Riverside Drive on the northeast, the Glendale Freeway on the east, Effie Street, Coronado Street, Berkeley Avenue and Fletcher Drive on the southeast, the Hollywood Freeway on the south, Virgil Avenue on the west and Fountain Avenue and Hyperion Avenue on the northwest.

The prime real estate around the Silver Lake Reservoir is known as Moreno Highlands. It was originally developed in the 1920s and 1930s by Daisy Canfield, wife of silent film star Antonio Moreno. Much of the Silver Lake Residential Historic District is associated with this tract.

The Silver Lake neighborhood council has mapped the boundaries of its council region.


==History==
The area known as Ivanhoe to the north of the current reservoir was originally developed by Byram &amp; Poindexter as early as 1887, named for Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s book of the same name with many streets in that area referencing other works and characters of British literature such as Herkimer, Rowena, Kenilworth, Locksley, Ben Lomond, Hawick, and St. George. 

 In 1904 the Fletcher Drive Viaduct was constructed at the northeastern boundary of Silver Lake for the Glendale Line of the Pacific Electric Railway Company, connecting the area to Downtown Los Angeles. Originally constructed of timber, the viaduct was replaced in 1928 by a steel span construction to make way for Fletcher Drive underneath it. It was demolished in 1959 and only its concrete footings remain.

William Mulholland identified the area as an ideal location to place emergency reservoirs for the rapidly growing city, building the upper Ivanhoe Reservoir in 1906 and the eponymous Silver Lake reservoir in 1907. The reservoir was named for influential former LA City Councilman and then City Water Commissioner Herman Silver, who was instrumental in gaining the approvals to purchase the of land and the funding for the construction of the reservoir.

The hills of Ivanhoe and the neighboring Edendale had always attracted bohemians seeking safe haven from the prying eyes of polite society, and the further development of Silver Lake as a lush parkland only increased its appeal. The 1930s and 1940s saw artists, writers, actors and musicians join other progressives such as union organizers, civic activists, and communists flock to the area. With them came the area&#x27;s modern aesthetics as architects such as Gregory Ain, Craig Ellwood, John Lautner, Rudolph Schindler, Walter Dorwin Teague, and Raphael Soriano designed their houses and businesses, creating what local realtors now point out as having more architecturally significant homes per square mile in Silver Lake than in other parts of Los Angeles.
William Selig set up what may have been the first permanent film studio in Los Angeles in the Edendale neighborhood to the east of Ivanhoe valley in 1909, soon followed by Mack Sennett in 1912. Walt Disney&#x27;s first studio was at the corner of Griffith Park Boulevard and Hyperion Avenue, currently the site of Gelson&#x27;s Market. As a consequence, the name &quot;Hyperion&quot; is used by The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries, with company entities past and present carrying the name, such as Hyperion Books and the Hyperion Theater at Disney California Adventure Park. The fictional Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights in the final season of the Disney-owned ABC series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; traces its name to the same origin.

William Fox would buy Selig&#x27;s former Edendale lot on Glendale Boulevard in the 1917, building a 12-acre (4.9 ha) backlot called Mixville for Western film star Tom Mix. The location is now known as the Mixville Shopping Center and occupied by a Whole Foods Market. It is rumored that Mix buried his steed &quot;Old Blue&quot; on the property.

The neighborhood is crisscrossed by numerous municipal staircases that provide pedestrian access up and down the neighborhood&#x27;s signature hills. Among these are the Descanso Stairs, Redcliff Stairs and the Music Box Stairs. The famous flight of stairs in Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s film &quot;The Music Box&quot; is located between lower Descanso Drive and Vendome Street, as it winds up and around the hill.

In the 1940s, Chinese-American architect Eugene Kinn Choy sought to build a house for his family in Silver Lake, but due to racial covenants still in effect prohibiting the sale of property to &quot;any person not of the Caucasian race,&quot; he was prevented from doing so. He went door to door to seek the approval of every house in the neighborhood before he was given approval to build in 1949.

Choy&#x27;s groundbreaking efforts opened the door to the Asian American and Latino communities in the 1950s and 1960s. Beginning in the 1970s, the neighborhood became the nexus of Los Angeles&#x27; gay leather subculture, similar to the SoMA neighborhood in San Francisco. Since the late 1990s, gentrification has changed the area by pushing out public sex and &quot;gay cruising&quot; and facilitating the opening of many independent upscale boutiques, coffee shops, fitness studios, and restaurants.

The community continues to evolve, incorporating its bohemian roots with its racial and sexual diversity of the mid 20th century as architects such as Barbara Bestor and Gustavo Gubel, artists such as cache and Eric Junker, and musicians like Moby and Flea continue to define Silver Lake’s environment as a cultural and creative enclave.

=== LGBT+ community ===

In the 1930s, Silver Lake and Echo Park still comprised Edendale and acted as a space where members of the LGBT community were able to express their identities. Prominent female impersonator Julian Eltinge built his house in Silver Lake and performed until the city passed laws criminalizing cross-dressing, after which he continued to recount his drag performances to audiences.

Silver Lake was also home to Harry Hay, credited with founding the first gay organization, the Mattachine Society, which began as Bachelors&#x27; Anonymous. Hay lived and had meetings in Silver Lake at the time the group began in 1950. Kevin Roderick wrote in his eulogy for Hay in &quot;Los Angeles&quot; that many consider the house located near Silver Lake to be the birthplace of the gay-rights movement.

The Black Cat Tavern, a fairly popular bar that has now become a historic-cultural monument, was the site of a police raid in 1967 that spread to adjacent bars, becoming a full-blown riot, which resulted in more than a dozen arrests. The protests in response to the raid predated the Stonewall riots by two years.

Los Globos is another popular bar that has become the site of Banjee Balls where LGBT youth come together. Voguing is a large part of the balls and brings a &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot; vibe into Los Angeles night life. The building was originally one of the earliest American Legion halls. Circus of Books was a bookstore and gay pornography shop that was notable as a gay cruising spot of the late 20th Century.

As the AIDS epidemic gripped the US in the 1980s, tensions between gay men and the LAPD escalated. Several LGBT activists in Silver Lake claimed they felt unsafe reporting hate crimes against them to the police, who they felt harbored anti-LGBT sentiments. Their complaints grew to the point that then-City Council member Michael Woo advocated establishing a hotline to relay information to police indirectly and compile statistics on the frequency of gay-bashings. Some bath houses, which acted as social spaces for gay men, were shut down by the city government in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The ensuing controversy reflected a nationwide debate about whether this type of action constituted public health policy or perpetuation of discrimination against the LGBT community.

In 1992, about 85 activists protested gay-bashing and violent acts against homosexuals in the area, carrying banners emblazoned with “Stop the Violence” along Sunset Boulevard.

Gay bar Akbar opened on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1995. In 2004, fearing displacement through gentrification, the bar&#x27;s owners purchased the building and converted the neighboring unit into a dance floor.

Since 2006, Eagle LA has served as a popular gathering point for the local gay leather subculture. Its location was home to several prior gay bars: Shed (1968-1972), Outcast (1972-1983), and Gauntlet II (1983-2005). 

In 2019, Maebe A. Girl, who is non-binary and uses she/her and they/them pronouns, became the first drag queen ever elected to public office in the United States, owing to being elected to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council.

==Reservoir==

The neighborhood was named for Water Board Commissioner Herman Silver, who was instrumental in the creation of the Silver Lake Reservoir in the neighborhood, one of the water storage reservoirs established as part of the controversial Los Angeles Aqueduct project in the early 1900s. This is one of ten that still remain in Los Angeles.

In the community of Silver Lake lies the namesake reservoir composed of two basins, with the lower named Silver Lake and the upper named Ivanhoe. The lower body of water was named in 1906 for Herman Silver; the upper body received its name from the 1819 Sir Walter Scott novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. In 1989 the City of Los Angeles, Cultural Heritage Commission, Cultural Affairs Department declared both reservoirs Historic-Cultural Monument No. 422.

The reservoirs are owned and maintained by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) and provided water to 600,000 homes in downtown and South Los Angeles until 2013 when federal water quality regulations mandated reservoirs be covered; The Headworks Reservoir complex replaced the Silver Lake and Ivanhoe reservoirs with two underground reservoirs, Headworks East and Headworks West located north of Griffith Park. 

Also within the grounds of the reservoir are several popular recreational facilities: the Silver Lake Recreation Center, which includes an adjacent city park; the Silver Lake Walking Path, which circumnavigates the reservoirs; two enclosed dog parks, and the Silver Lake Meadow, modeled after NYC&#x27;s Central Park Sheep Meadow. On the northeast corner of the property is the Neighborhood Nursery School, which since 1976 has been at the corner of Tesla Avenue and Silver Lake Boulevard. It is a parent-participation cooperative preschool, affiliated with the California Council of Parent Participation Nursery Schools.

==Government==
As of 2024, Silver Lake is represented by Los Angeles City Council Members Hugo Soto-Martinez and Nithya Raman and the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council. The Silver Lake Neighborhood Council (SLNC) was formed in the early 2000s and certified as part of the City of Los Angeles Neighborhood Council system in February 2003. Its 21-member governing board is elected for two-year terms in September. Recent projects have included &quot;Street Medallions&quot; created by artist Cheri Gaulke, &quot;ArtCans&quot;, the &quot;Electrical Art Box Project&quot;, and the second annual &quot;Make Music LA&quot; created by several different artists, groups, and the SLNC Arts &amp; Culture Committee, whose current co-chairs are Renee Dawson and Dulce Stein.

The Silver Lake Residents Association, the Silver Lake Improvement Association, the Silver Lake Reservoirs Conservancy, and the Silver Lake Chamber of Commerce are all active in the area.

==Demographics==
The 2010 U.S. census counted 37,019 residents in the neighborhood—an average of 11.99k people per square mile, ranking Silver Lake 38th in population density among 121 Los Angeles Neighborhoods. The median age for residents was 35, about average for Los Angeles, but the percentages of residents aged 19 to 49 were among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was highly diverse ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 35.8%; whites, 42.9%; Asians and Asian Americans, 15.1%; blacks, 3.4%; Mixed Race and others, 2.7%. Most common Continent of Birth was the Americas, (57.9%); including Mexico, (22.7%); El Salvador, (17.6%); Guatemala, (8.4%); Columbia, (1.7%); and Nicaragua, (1.5%); followed Asia, (32.6%), with the Philippines (19.2%) being the most common Asian place of birth. Residents born in the US comprise 67.4% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population, slightly higher than the 64.4% average for Los Angeles County. 

The median yearly household income in 2010 dollars was $74,587, approximately 44.7% higher than the $ 51,538 median household income for Los Angeles. By neighborhood track, medians can range from $42,991 to $135,011 depending on location. The average household size of 2.3 people was low for the city. Renters occupied 64.3% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners the rest.

The percentages of never-married men (55.8%) and women (49.0%) were among the county&#x27;s highest. Both statistics could be due in part to the large numbers of LGBT members in the community or the median age range.

==Education==
The majority of residents (56.8%) aged 25 years and older have obtained a higher degree, compared to the 38.5% for Los Angeles in general.

===Library===
The Silver Lake District is also served by the Silver Lake Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. It is located at 2411 Glendale Boulevard, in northeastern Silver Lake between the reservoir and the I-5 freeway.

==Entertainment and nightlife==
Silver Lake, known as one of &quot;the city&#x27;s hippest neighborhoods&quot;, has many bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Since the 1990s, the neighborhood has become the center of the alternative and indie rock scene in Los Angeles. It was home to two major yearly street festivals: the Silver Lake Jubilee, held in May and the Sunset Junction Street Fair, held in August. The last Sunset Junction festival was held in 2010 and abruptly cancelled in 2011 just days before it was supposed to take place, after years of neighborhood controversy. The Silver Lake Jubilee, the more recent addition, featured live music by local musicians, local artists and community businesses. It moved to the Arts District and changed its name to the Jubilee Music and Arts Festival in 2013.

A comparison has been drawn between New York City&#x27;s Williamsburg neighborhood and Silver Lake, which has been called the &quot;Williamsburg of the West&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
In addition to being the site of early Western films&#x27; star Tom Mix&#x27;s studio on Glendale Boulevard, Silver Lake has been used as the film location for several films and television shows and also shown in some video games. 
* Silent star Antonio Moreno and his wife Daisy Canfield Moreno&#x27;s Canfield-Moreno Estate has been frequently used as a filming location.

In the opening scene Nick Clark (Frank Dillane) is seen running frantically down a busy street before being struck by a motorist and collapsing at Griffith Park Boulevard and Edgecliffe Drive. When segueing into the show&#x27;s title sequence, an aerial high-rise shot of Clark lying in the street shows the pedestrian plaza.

<text>Sir Henry Lumley Drayton (April 27, 1869 – August 28, 1950) was a Canadian lawyer and politician.

== Early life ==

Born in Kingston, Ontario, the son of Philip Henry Drayton, who came to Canada with the 16th Rifles of England, and Margaret S. Covernton, Drayton was educated in schools in both England and Canada. He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1891 and was created a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1908.

== Legal career ==

From 1893 to 1900, Drayton was an Assistant City Solicitor for Toronto. In 1900, he formed a partnership with Charles J. Holman. In 1902, he was appointed Counsel to the Railway Committee of the Ontario Legislature. From 1904 to 1909, he was a County Crown Attorney for the County of York. In 1910, he was appointed Counsel for the Corporation of the City of Toronto. In 1911, he was appointed to the Toronto Power Commission. In 1912, he was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.

Drayton was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada from Kingston in a 1919 by-election as a Conservative Party candidate. He served as Minister of Finance under both Sir Robert Borden and Arthur Meighen until the Conservative Party&#x27;s defeat in the 1921 general election. Drayton kept his seat in that election.

In 1927, he was a candidate the leadership of the Conservative Party, but finished in last place. Drayton retired from politics in 1928 to become chairman of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.

He attempted to return to Parliament in the 1945 election from a seat in Victoria, British Columbia, but lost narrowly to the Liberal candidate.

== Personal life and death ==

He was conferred a knighthood as a Knight Bachelor, which carries no postnominal letters, but carried the title &#x27;Sir&#x27; before his name though.

<doc id="544880" wikidata="Q7899918" url="?curid=544880" title="Urban Guerrilla">
<text>&quot;Urban Guerrilla&quot; is a 1973 song by the UK rock group Hawkwind. It was originally released as a single in the UK (UP 35566) on 27 July 1973 with &quot;Brainbox Pollution&quot; as the B side, reaching #39 on the UK singles chart before being withdrawn after 3 weeks. It is also on the remastered version of &quot;Doremi Fasol Latido&quot;.

==Lyrics and controversy==
Robert Calvert wrote and sang the lyrics, this being Hawkwind&#x27;s only studio recording with a Calvert vocal prior to his rejoining the band as a permanent frontman and vocalist in 1976.

At the time of the single&#x27;s release, the IRA had instigated a bombing campaign in London and the BBC refused to play the single. After deliberation and the brief notion of promoting the b-side instead (&quot;Brainbox Pollution&quot;, which dealt with the effects of drug misuse), the band&#x27;s management opted to withdraw the single stating that &quot;Although the record was selling very well, we didn&#x27;t want to feel that any sales might be gained by association with recent events - even though the song was written by Bob Calvert two years ago as a satirical comment, and was recorded three months ago.&quot; Dave Brock has subsequently stated that &quot;It was stupid to withdraw it, they were paranoid they&#x27;d get bombed. I thought that record was what everything was about in the 1970s.&quot;

Calvert originally claimed the lyrics were a satire, but later claimed that &quot;it didn&#x27;t surprise me that it was banned by the BBC at all, in fact, I expected it to cause a lot of controversy&quot;. Lemmy explains that &quot;We once did a benefit gig for the Stoke Newington 8. They were anarchists of some sort (The Angry Brigade) - making bombs in your basement and all that. Urban Guerrilla was about that. That&#x27;s what Calvert was like.&quot;

It had been reported at the time that Nik Turner&#x27;s flat in Gloucester Road had been raided and searched by the bomb squad, but a 1998 interview with Turner suggests that this activity was more to do with visiting Hells Angels wanted in connection with manslaughter.

==Music==
As far as the music is concerned, many of the band weren&#x27;t happy with it anyway. Del Dettmar commented &quot;The mix is too toppy. I&#x27;d like to re-do the ending. Ah well, it&#x27;s not a very good song anyway. And it isn&#x27;t very well played.&quot;, whilst Simon King stated &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the idea of doing a single, and I didn&#x27;t like the song to be quite honest.&quot; Lemmy liked the song: &quot;We didn&#x27;t make commercial records - the best thing we made was &#x27;Urban Guerrilla&#x27;, but that got pulled off the racks because it was when the IRA bombed Harrods. Went down like a concrete parachute, that.&quot;

==Other versions==
The band undertook an extensive UK tour in June and July 1973 to promote the single, a poorly recorded version from this time appearing on Bring Me the Head of Yuri Gagarin, but soon after Calvert stopped working with the band in an official capacity (largely due to the instability caused by his bi-polar disorder) and the song was dropped. It was restored to the live set in 1977 during Calvert&#x27;s second spell with the band and remained even after his departure in 1978, the vocals being handled by Brock and a live version appearing on the b-side to the &quot;Shot Down in the Night&quot; single. It was finally dropped in 1984.

*Mudhoney, one of Seattle&#x27;s pioneers of Grunge have often voiced their appreciation of Hawkwind and recorded a version of the song for a John Peel session in 2002.
*Cobra Verde covered the song for their covers album.
*Primal Scream covered the song released as a single in 2008, adding the line &quot;I&#x27;m a suicide bomber&quot;.

<doc id="544882" wikidata="Q7991502" url="?curid=544882" title="What You Will">
<text>What You Will is a late Elizabethan comedy by John Marston, written in 1601 and probably performed by the Children of Paul&#x27;s, one of the companies of boy actors popular in that period.

The play was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 6 August 1607, and was published later that year in a quarto printed by George Eld for the bookseller Thomas Thorpe. Inconsistencies in the names of the characters suggest that the play was revised between its stage premier in 1601 and its publication in 1607. The Induction that precedes the text mentions a small sized stage and candles for illumination, details that verify that the play was acted in a smaller &quot;private&quot; theatre rather than a large &quot;public&quot; one like the Globe or the Fortune.

The play focuses on the relationship between two rival poets: the bitter, misanthropic satirist Lampatho Doria and the generous, lighthearted epicurean Quadratus. The play itself hardly has a plot, being more a series of comic vignettes and debates between characters. It criticizes the satirist as a mean-spirited, envious man, and celebrates good humor, merriment and &quot;play.&quot; The subplot involves the tricking and humiliation of various fools by a group of boy pages.

&quot;What You Will&quot; was one of the plays involved in the War of the Theatres in 1599–1601. The character Lampatho Doria is generally thought to represent Ben Jonson, Marston&#x27;s opponent in the controversy, while Quadratus may stand in for Marston himself.

In 1567 town had a marketplace, 4 streets and 27 houses. In 1630 first church was built and since 1638 &quot;Skilandžiai&quot; was started to be named as Salantai. In 1667 parish school was founded. In 1668 Salantai was being named a town in which 66 families lived. In 1750 forty Catholic homes or homesteads (&quot;kiemas&quot;) were counted. A few years later, in 1765, the first enumeration of Jewish taxpayers found 279.

Aleksandras Bendikas, the Lithuanian book carrier and publisher settled in Salantai and since 1905 started to publish a calendar for the farmers &quot;Traveler, leaving to Samogitia and Lithuania&quot; (&quot;Keleivis, išeinąs į Žemaičius ir Lietuvą&quot;). A parson, canon Pranas Urbonavičius established a consumers&#x27; co-operative &quot;Kaukas&quot; in 1905, in 1906 opened a Lithuanian primary school for girls supported by the Saulė Society, and in 1906–1911 built church (archit. Karlas Eduardas Strandmanas).

This town is known for three famed rabbis: Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter, his teacher Rabbi Zundel Salant, and Rabbi Shmuel Salant, who spent most of his life in Salantai. Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Jerusalem between 1866 and 1910, also lived here before immigration. 
During the summer of 1941, 95 Jews of the city were massacred in a mass execution by Nazis and their local collaborators in the nearby forest.

In 2025, Lithuanian researchers found records in metrics of the Salantai Church of the Assumption where it is stated that Michał Kleofas Ogiński was born in the surroundings of Salantai and was baptized in the Salantai Church of the Assumption.

==Culture==
The Orvydas Farmstead located on the outskirts of Salantai is a sculpture park created by the Lithuanian artist Vilius Orvydas.

<text>Invar, also known generically as FeNi36 (64FeNi in the US), is a nickel–iron alloy notable for its uniquely low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE or α). The name &quot;Invar&quot; comes from the word &quot;invariable&quot;, referring to its relative lack of expansion or contraction with temperature changes, and is a registered trademark of ArcelorMittal.

The discovery of the alloy was made in 1895 by Swiss physicist Charles Édouard Guillaume for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1920. It enabled improvements in scientific instruments.

== Properties ==
Like other nickel/iron compositions, Invar is a solid solution; that is, it is a single-phase alloy. In one commercial grade called Invar 36 it consists of approximately 36% nickel and 64% iron, has a melting point of , a density of and a resistivity of . The invar range was described by Westinghouse scientists in 1961 as &quot;30–45 atom per cent nickel&quot;.

Common grades of Invar have a coefficient of thermal expansion (denoted α, and measured between 20 °C and 100 °C) of about 1.2 × 10−6 K−1 (), while ordinary steels have values of around 11–15 ppm/°C. Extra-pure grades (&lt;0.1% Co) can readily produce values as low as 0.62–0.65 ppm/°C. Some formulations display negative thermal expansion (NTE) characteristics. Though it displays high dimensional stability over a range of temperatures, it does have a propensity to creep.

Historically, the paramagnetic properties of certain iron-nickel alloys were first identified as a unique characteristic. These alloys exhibit a coexistence of two types of structures, whose proportions vary depending on temperature. One of these structures is characterized by a high magnetic moment (ranging from ) and a high lattice parameter, adhering to Hund&#x27;s rules. The other structure, in contrast, has a low magnetic moment (ranging from ) and a low lattice parameter. When exposed to a variable magnetic field, this dual-structure nature induces dimensional changes in the alloy. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the case of Invar alloys, which are renowned for their exceptional dimensional stability over a wide range of temperatures. However, to maintain this stability, it is crucial to avoid exposing the material to magnetic fields, as such exposure can disrupt the delicate balance between the two structures and lead to undesirable dimensional variations.

In recent years, advancements in material science have led to the development of non-ferromagnetic Invar alloys. These innovative materials have opened up new possibilities for applications in cutting-edge fields such as the semiconductor industry and aerospace engineering. By eliminating the influence of magnetic fields on dimensional stability, non-ferromagnetic Invar alloys have the potential to significantly enhance the performance of optical instruments and other precision devices.

== Applications ==
Invar is used where high dimensional stability is required, such as precision instruments, clocks, seismic creep gauges, color-television tubes&#x27; shadow-mask frames, valves in engines and large aerostructure molds.

One of its first applications was in watch balance wheels and pendulum rods for precision regulator clocks. At the time it was invented, the pendulum clock was the world&#x27;s most precise timekeeper, and the limit to timekeeping accuracy was due to thermal variations in length of clock pendulums. The Riefler regulator clock developed in 1898 by Clemens Riefler, the first clock to use an Invar pendulum, had an accuracy of 10 milliseconds per day, and served as the primary time standard in naval observatories and for national time services until the 1930s.

In land surveying, when first-order (high-precision) elevation leveling is to be performed, the level staff (leveling rod) used is made of Invar, instead of wood, fiberglass, or other metals. Invar struts were used in some pistons to limit their thermal expansion inside their cylinders. In the manufacture of large composite material structures for aerospace carbon fibre layup molds, Invar is used to facilitate the manufacture of parts to extremely tight tolerances.

In the astronomical field, Invar is used as the structural components that support dimension-sensitive optics of astronomical telescopes. Superior dimensional stability of Invar allows the astronomical telescopes to significantly improve the observation precision and accuracy.

== Variations ==
There are variations of the original Invar material that have slightly different coefficient of thermal expansion such as:
*Inovco, which is Fe–33Ni–4.5Co and has an α of 0.55 ppm/°C (from 20 to 100 °C).
*FeNi42 (for example NILO alloy 42), which has a nickel content of 42% and , matching that of silicon, is widely used as lead frame material for integrated circuits, etc.
*FeNiCo alloys—named Kovar or Dilver P—that have the same expansion behaviour (~) and form strong bonds with molten borosilicate glass, and because of that are used for glass-to-metal seals, and to support optical parts in a wide range of temperatures and applications, such as satellites.
*Elinvar has a near-constant modulus of elasticity, making it valuable for wristwatch balance wheels, spring scales, and other spring-based measuring instruments.

== Explanation of anomalous properties ==
A detailed explanation of Invar&#x27;s anomalously low CTE has proven elusive for physicists.

All the iron-rich face-centered cubic Fe–Ni alloys show Invar anomalies in their measured thermal and magnetic properties that evolve continuously in intensity with varying alloy composition. Scientists had once proposed that Invar&#x27;s behavior was a direct consequence of a high-magnetic-moment to low-magnetic-moment transition occurring in the face centered cubic Fe–Ni series (and that gives rise to the mineral antitaenite); however, this theory was proven incorrect. Instead, it appears that the low-moment/high-moment transition is preceded by a high-magnetic-moment frustrated ferromagnetic state in which the Fe–Fe magnetic exchange bonds have a large magneto-volume effect of the right sign and magnitude to create the observed thermal expansion anomaly.

Wang et al. considered the statistical mixture between the fully ferromagnetic (FM) configuration and the spin-flipping configurations (SFCs) in with the free energies of FM and SFCs predicted from first-principles calculations and were able to predict the temperature ranges of negative thermal expansion under various pressures. It was shown that all individual FM and SFCs have positive thermal expansion, and the negative thermal expansion originates from the increasing populations of SFCs with smaller volumes than that of FM.

<text>Keith Martin, is a Canadian politician and physician. He was the Member of Parliament for the riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca in British Columbia, Canada from 1993 to 2011. Originally a member of the Reform Party, and then the Canadian Alliance, he did not join the newly formed Conservative Party of Canada post-merger, and instead became a member of the Liberal Party from 2004 until 2011. 

He is currently the executive director of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health in Washington, D.C.

==Early life and career==
Martin was born in London, UK, and grew up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He attended Neil McNeil High School and graduated from the University of Toronto with a Doctorate of Medicine and a Bachelor of Science. 

He practiced emergency and family medicine from 1987 to 2005. He also did two terms as a doctor in a rural region of South Africa during the Mozambique war. Martin is a member of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons&#x27; Advisory Committee on International Initiatives.

== Federal politics ==
He was first elected in 1993 as a member of the Reform Party of Canada for the riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. Being socially liberal, he often clashed with the Reform&#x27;s conservative ideas. 

From 1996 to 2000 he had his own nationally syndicated television program on current events called Beyond Politics.

When the Reform Party was folded into the Canadian Alliance, he sought the party leadership, but finished fourth with 2% of the vote. 

In both 2009 and 2010, political commentator Rex Murphy, from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot;, recognized Martin as the most underrated politician in the House of Commons.

Martin led many initiatives in the House of Commons, including legislation to ban landmines (1995, 1996), establish an international mechanism to prevent deadly conflict (Responsibility to Protect) 2007, democratize Parliament, support early learning programs (Head Start) 2000, and modernize Canada&#x27;s healthcare system.

Martin has been on diplomatic missions to areas in crisis, including Sudan, the Middle East, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, and the Sahal. He led initiatives to provide emergency relief in times of crisis, e.g., the 2004 tsunami, famine in Niger, North Pakistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, etc. He also took an international leadership role in global health, including chairing global pre-G8 parliamentary committees in Japan and Rome.

He&#x27;s had experience between 1986–2007 volunteering on conservation programs in Africa, especially on rhino and other large mammals projects. He has been an ardent campaigner against the trafficking of illegal wildlife products, and has strongly supported the integration of conservation into development initiatives.

 On April 17, 2002, he caused a controversy as he attempted to remove the ceremonial mace from the table of the Clerk of the House to protest an intervention by the government that violated MP&#x27;s fundamental democratic rights. He was found to be in contempt and not allowed to retake his seat until he had apologized to the House from the Bar. The reason for his actions was as a result of an amendment that would have removed the entire contents of Martin&#x27;s Private Members&#x27; Bill C-344 which violated the spirit and meaning of Private Members Business.

=== Liberal ===
In January 2004, after the Canadian Alliance merged with the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party to form the Conservative Party of Canada, Martin announced he would not join the new party. He sat as an independent for the remainder of the 37th Parliament, but ran as a Liberal in the 2004 election. He was re-elected, and served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence. Martin was subsequently re-elected in the 2006 and 2008 federal elections. He has served in many shadow cabinet positions including foreign affairs, health and international development. He has taken leadership roles in many areas including: global health, domestic health, foreign affairs, conservation and the environment and human rights. He was appointed in 2004 by Prime Minister Paul Martin to be a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council.

Martin has organized several relief efforts to ship urgent medical supplies to areas in crisis.

He is the founder of several global health and conservation initiatives. He is Founder and Chair of the first all Party International Conservation Caucus. In 2010, he founded the International Conservation Forum, a website that increases awareness and facilitates action on key conservation issues through the use of social media and the publication of the online magazine - The Horn.

On November 9, 2010, Martin announced that he wouldn&#x27;t run in the next election, stating that &quot;Canada&#x27;s institutions need new blood and new ideas.&quot; He&#x27;s been an outspoken critic of the decline in democracy in parliament and the increasing disempowerment of Members of Parliament.

== Post-politics career ==
In September 2012, Martin was appointed as the founding Executive Director of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH). With over 170 academic institutions and a network of 30,000 scientists worldwide, CUGH is the world&#x27;s largest consortium of its kind. It works across research, education, advocacy and service, across disciplines, to improve the health of people and the planet. CUGH is particularly focused on improving health and environmental outcomes in low-income communities.

November 2014, Martin made presentations on the nexus between environmental sustainability, conservation, and human health at the World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia. He regularly speaks at conferences on a wide range of global health issues (www.cugh.org) covering health, conservation, the environment and politics. He has co-chaired CUGH&#x27;s last 7 global health conferences that attract over 1800 scientists and students from over 50 nations. He is a member of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, a member of the editorial Board of the Annals of Global Health, a member of the Board of Directors of the Jane Goodall Institute and an adviser to the International Cancer Expert Corps.

<doc id="544898" wikidata="Q186794" url="?curid=544898" title="Botswana pula">
<text>The pula (also known as the Botswana dollar) is the currency of Botswana. It has the ISO 4217 code &quot;BWP&quot; and is subdivided into 100 &quot;thebe&quot;. &quot;Pula&quot; literally means &quot;rain&quot; in Setswana, because rain is very scarce in Botswana—home to much of the Kalahari Desert—and therefore valuable and a blessing. The word also serves as the national motto of the country.

A sub-unit of the currency is known as &quot;thebe&quot;, or &quot;shield&quot;, and represents defence. The names were picked with the help of the public.

==History==

The pula was introduced on 23 August 1976, subsequently known as &quot;Pula Day&quot;, replacing the rand at par. One hundred days after the pula was introduced, the rand ceased to be legal tender in Botswana.

==Coins==

In 1976, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 thebe. The 1 thebe was struck in aluminium, with the 5 thebe in bronze and the others in cupro-nickel. These coins were round except for the scalloped 1 pula. Bronze, dodecagonal 2 thebe coins were introduced in 1981 and discontinued after 1985. In 1991, bronze-plated steel replaced bronze in the 5 thebe, nickel-plated steel replaced cupro-nickel in the 10, 25 and 50 thebe and the 1 pula changed to a smaller, nickel-brass, equilateral-curve seven-sided coin. A similarly shaped, nickel-brass 2 pula was introduced in 1994. In 2004, the composition was changed to brass-plated steel and the size was slightly reduced.

Following the withdrawal of the 1 and 2 thebe in 1991 and 1998 respectively, smaller 5, 10, 25 and 50 thebe coins were introduced, with the 5 and 25 thebe coins being seven-sided and the 10 and 50 thebe coins remaining round. A bimetallic 5 pula depicting a mopane caterpillar and a branch of the mopane tree it feeds on was introduced in 2000 composed of a cupronickel centre in a ring made of aluminium-nickel-bronze.

A new series of coins was introduced in 2013. All previous coins were demonetized with effect from 28 August 2014, and remained exchangeable to current coins for 5 years until 28 August 2019.

The word &quot;Ipelegeng&quot; is found on the coins, which literally means &quot;to carry your own weight&quot; or &quot;to be self-sufficient or independent&quot; but in general has various different meanings in the Tswana language.

==Banknotes==
On 23 August 1976, the Bank of Botswana introduced notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, and 10 pula; a 20 pula note followed on 16 February 1978. The 1 and 2 pula notes were replaced by coins in 1991 and 1994, whilst the first 50 and 100 pula notes were introduced on 29 May 1990 and 23 August 1993, respectively. The 5 pula note was replaced by a coin in 2000. The original 1, 2 and 5 pula banknotes were demonetized on 1 July 2011.

The current series of notes was introduced on 23 August 2009 and contains, for the first time, a 200 pula banknote.

In response to the concern of the poor quality of the paper of the 10 pula banknote, the Bank of Botswana unveiled a 10 pula banknote in polymer in November 2017 which was issued to the public on 1 February 2018.

In 2020, the Bank of Botswana issued a new 10 pula polymer banknote that features an image of the current President of Botswana, Mokgweetsi Masisi.



==Zimbabwe==
Due to hyperinflation in Zimbabwe from 2006 to 2008, the government of Zimbabwe has allowed circulation of foreign currency since 2008. The Zimbabwean dollar became obsolete on 12 April 2009. Several currencies, including the South African rand and Botswana pula, circulate in Zimbabwe, along with the Zimbabwean bond notes and bond coins.

==Lesotho==
The word &quot;pula&quot; also serves as part of the national motto of the Kingdom of Lesotho. As in Botswana, it means &quot;rain&quot; in the Sotho language and is considered a synonym for &quot;blessing&quot;.

<text>Yisrael ben Ze&#x27;ev Wolf Lipkin, also known as &quot;Israel Salanter&quot; or &quot;Yisroel Salanter&quot; (November 3, 1809 – February 2, 1883), was the father of the Musar movement in Orthodox Judaism and a famed Rosh yeshiva and Talmudist. The epithet &quot;Salanter&quot; was added to his name since most of his schooling took place in Salant (now the Lithuanian town of Salantai), where he came under the influence of Rabbi Yosef Zundel of Salant. He was the father of mathematician Yom Tov Lipman Lipkin.

==Biography==
Yisroel Lipkin was born in Zagare, Lithuania on November 3, 1809, the son of Zev Wolf, the rabbi of that town and later Av Beth Din of Goldingen and Telz, and his wife Leah. As a boy, he studied with Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh Braude of Salant.

After his 1823 marriage to Esther Fega Eisenstein Lipkin settled with her in Salant where he continued his studies under Hirsch Broda and Zundel, himself a disciple of Chaim Volozhin.

Around 1833 he met the decade-younger Alexander Moshe Lapidos, who became his lifelong student and friend.

Around 1842, Lipkin was appointed rosh yeshiva (dean) of Meile&#x27;s yeshiva (&quot;Tomchai Torah&quot;) in Vilna. When a minor scandal arose related to his appointment, he left the post to its previous inhabitant and moved to Zaretcha, an exurb of Vilna, and established a new yeshiva where he lectured for about three years.

Jewish law prohibits doing certain categories of work on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) except in life-threatening emergencies. During the cholera epidemic of 1848 Lipkin ensured that any necessary relief work on Shabbat for Jews was done by Jews. Although some wanted such work to be done on Shabbat by non-Jews, Lipkin said that both Jewish ethics and law mandate that the obligation to save lives takes priority over other laws. During Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), Lipkin ordered that Jews that year must not abide by the traditional fast, but instead must eat in order to maintain their health, again for emergency health reasons.

In 1848, the Czarist government created the Vilna Rabbinical School and Teachers&#x27; Seminary. Lipkin was identified as a candidate to teach at or run the school. As he feared that the school would be used to produce rabbinical &quot;puppets&quot; of the government, he refused the position and left Vilna. Salanter moved to Kovno, where he established a Musar-focused yeshiva at the Nevyozer Kloiz.

In 1857 he left Lithuania and moved to Prussia. He remained in the house of philanthropists, the Hirsch brothers of Halberstadt, until his health improved. In 1861 he started publication of the Hebrew journal &quot;Tevunah&quot;, devoted to rabbinical law and religious ethics. After three months the journal had failed to garner enough subscriptions to cover its costs, so he closed it.

Lipkin lived for periods in Memel, Königsberg and Berlin. Toward the end of his life, Lipkin went to Paris to organize a community among the many Russian Jewish immigrants, and he remained there for two years.

Lipkin was one of the first people to try to translate the Talmud into another language. However, he died before he could finish this immense project. Lipkin died on Friday, February 2, 1883 (25 Shevat 5643), in Königsberg, then part of Germany. For many years, the exact location of his grave was unknown. Following a lengthy investigation, in 2007 the grave was located in Königsberg.

In order to be able to legally travel outside of the Pale of Settlement, he became a master dye-maker, enabling him to receive a permit allowing free travel within Russia.

When the Russian Empire established military conscription of young Jewish men, Lipkin wrote to rabbis and community leaders urging them to obey and make lists of young men for the government while working through political connections in St. Petersburg to abolish the conscription.

==Teachings==
Lipkin was known as the father of the Musar movement that developed, particularly among the Lithuanian Jews, in 19th century Orthodox Eastern Europe. The Hebrew term musar (מוּסַר), is from the book of Proverbs 1:2 meaning instruction, discipline, or conduct. The term was used by the Musar movement to refer to disciplined efforts to further ethical and spiritual development. The study of Musar is a part of the study of Jewish ethics.

Lipkin is best known for stressing that the inter-personal laws of the Torah bear as much weight as Divine obligations. According to Lipkin, adhering to the ritual aspects of Judaism without developing one&#x27;s relationships with others and oneself was an unpardonable parody. There are many anecdotal stories about him that relate to this moral equation, see for example the following references.

The concept of the unconscious appears in the writings of Lipkin well before the concept was popularized by Sigmund Freud, though its discussion predates Lipkin as well. Already in 1880, the concept of conscious and subconscious processes and the role they play in the psychological, emotional and moral functioning of man are fully developed and elucidated. These concepts are referred to in his works as the &quot;outer&quot; &quot;[chitzoniut]&quot; and &quot;inner&quot; &quot;[penimiut]&quot; processes, they are also referred to as the &quot;clear&quot; &quot;[klarer]&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; &quot;[dunkler]&quot; processes. They form a fundamental building block of many of Rabbi Salanter&#x27;s letters, essays and teachings. He would write that it is critical for a person to recognize what his subconscious motivations &quot;[negiot]&quot; are and to work on understanding them.

Lipkin would teach that the time for a person to work on not allowing improper subconscious impulses to affect him was during times of emotional quiet, when a person is more in control of his thoughts and feelings. He would stress that when a person is experiencing an acute emotional response to an event, he is not necessarily in control of his thoughts and faculties and will not have access to the calming perspectives necessary to allow his conscious mind to intercede.

Based on his understanding of subconscious motivation, Lipkin was faced with a quandary. Given that a person&#x27;s subconscious motivations are often not apparent or under the control of a person and are likely to unseat conscious decisions that they may make, how is it then possible for a person to control and modify their own actions in order to improve their actions and act in accordance with the dictates of the Torah? If the basis of a person&#x27;s actions are not controlled by them, how can they change them through conscious thought?

Lipkin argued that the only solution to this dilemma is to study ethical teachings with intense emotion [&quot;limud hamusar behispa&#x27;alut&quot;]. He taught that a person should choose an ethical statement [&quot;ma&#x27;amar chazal&quot;] and repeat this over and over with great feeling and concentration on its meaning. Through this repetition and internal arousal, a person would be able to bring the idea represented in the ethical teaching into the realm of his subconscious and thus improve their behaviour and &quot;character traits&quot;.

Lipkin felt that people would be embarrassed to study ethical teachings [&quot;limud ha&#x27;musar&quot;] in such a way in a normal study-hall [&quot;bet ha&#x27;medrash&quot;] and he therefore invented the idea of a &quot;house of ethical teachings&quot; [&quot;bet ha&#x27;mussar&quot;] that would be located next to an ordinary study hall and that would be designated for learning ethics in this way.

One of the more popular teachings of Lipkin is based on a real life encounter he had with a shoemaker one very late night. It was Motza&#x27;ei Shabbat (Saturday night after Shabbat) and Lipkin was on the way to the synagogue to recite Selichot. Suddenly he felt a tear in his shoe, so he looked around town to see if there was a shoemaker still open for business at this late hour. Finally he located a shoemaker sitting in his shop working next to his candle. Lipkin walked in and asked him, &quot;Is it too late now to get my shoes repaired?&quot; The shoemaker replied, &quot;As long as the candle is burning, it is still possible to repair.&quot; Upon hearing this, Lipkin ran to the synagogue and preached to the public what he had learned from the shoemaker. In his words, as long as the candle is burning, as long as one is still alive, it is still possible to repair one&#x27;s soul.

==Famous disciples==

Lipkin believed that accomplishment in spiritual growth is not limited to rabbinic figures but is also the realm of the ordinary layman. Therefore, his closest disciples included not only leading rabbis of the next generation but also laymen who would come to exert a tremendous positive influence on the physical and spiritual lot of their brethren. Nevertheless, there is little detailed information available concerning his non-rabbinic disciples.

Among Lipkin&#x27;s most famous students were:
*Naftali Amsterdam (נפתלי אמשטרדאם)
*Yitzchak Blazer
*Eliezer Gordon
*Jacob Joseph
*Yerucham Perlman
*Simcha Zissel Ziv
*Yosef Yozel Horwitz

His layperson disciples included figures such as the banker Eliyahu (Elinka) of Kretinga and the tea magnate, Kalman Zev Wissotzky.

==Published works==
Many of his articles from the journal &quot;Tevunah&quot; were collected and published in &quot;Imrei Binah&quot; (1878). His &quot;Iggeres HaMusar&quot; (&quot;Ethical Letter&quot;) was first published in 1858 and then repeatedly thereafter. Many of his letters were published in &quot;Ohr Yisrael&quot; (&quot;The Light of Israel&quot;) in 1890 (edited by Yitzchak Blazer). His disciples collected many of his discourses and published them in &quot;Even Yisrael&quot; (1853) and &quot;Etz Peri&quot; (1881).

<text>Soviet anti-Zionism is an anti-Zionist and pro-Arab doctrine promulgated in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. While the Soviet Union initially pursued a pro-Zionist policy after World War II due to its perception that the Jewish state would be socialist and pro-Soviet, its outlook on the Arab–Israeli conflict changed as Israel began to develop a close relationship with the United States and aligned itself with the Western Bloc. 

Anti-Israel Soviet propaganda intensified after Israel&#x27;s sweeping victory in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, and it was officially sponsored by the agitation and propaganda media of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as well as by the KGB. Among other charges, it alleged that Zionism was a form of racism. The Soviets framed their anti-Zionist propaganda in the guise of a study of modern Zionism, dubbed &quot;Zionology&quot;. The Soviet anti-Israel policy included the regulated denial of permission for Jews in the Soviet Union to emigrate, primarily to Israel, but also to any other country.

== Background ==
The official Soviet ideological position on Zionism condemned the movement as akin to bourgeois nationalism. Vladimir Lenin rejected Zionism as a reactionary movement, &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot;, &quot;socially retrogressive&quot;, and a backward force that deprecates class divisions among Jews. From late 1944, however, Joseph Stalin adopted a pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that a Jewish state would emerge socialist and pro-Soviet, and thus would speed the decline of British influence in the Middle East. Accordingly, in November 1947, the Soviet Union, together with the other countries of the Eastern Bloc, voted in favour of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which would pave the way for the establishment of the State of Israel. On 17 May 1948, three days after the Israeli Declaration of Independence, the Soviet Union granted &quot;de jure&quot; recognition to Israel, becoming the second country to recognize Israel overall (preceded by the United States&#x27; granting of &quot;de facto&quot; recognition) and the first country to grant it &quot;de jure&quot; recognition. Nevertheless, Stalin soon returned to the preexisting &quot;party line&quot; regarding Zionism in response to Israel&#x27;s growing alliance with the United States, starting an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, which would culminate in the Doctors&#x27; plot, an antisemitic Soviet conspiracy theory. The Soviet press engaged in attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and &quot;rootless cosmopolitanism&quot;.

In his 1969 book &quot;Beware! Zionism&quot;, Yuri Ivanov, the Soviet Union&#x27;s leading Zionologist, defined modern Zionism as follows:
Soviet leaders denied that their anti-Zionism was antisemitic. As proof, they pointed to the fact that several prominent Zionologists were ethnic Jews representing an expert opinion. Many—including some within the Soviet Union itself—argued that Zionology exhibited antisemitic themes. For example, in November 1975, the Soviet historian and academic M. Korostovtsev wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Suslov, regarding the book &quot;The Encroaching Counter Revolution&quot; by Vladimir Begun: &quot;...it perceptibly stirs up anti-Semitism under the flag of anti-Zionism.&quot;

Some Zionology books, &quot;exposing&quot; Zionism and Judaism, were included in the mandatory reading list for military and police personnel, students, teachers and Communist Party members and were mass published.

The third edition of the thirty-volume &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; (Большая Советская энциклопедия, БСЭ), published in 1969–1978, qualifies Zionism as racism and makes the following assertions:
* &quot;The main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti-Communism and anti-Sovietism&quot;
* &quot;The anti-human reactionary essence of Zionism&quot; is &quot;overt and covert fight against freedom movements and against the USSR&quot;
* &quot;International Zionist Organization owns major financial funds, partly through Jewish monopolists and partly collected by Jewish mandatory charities&quot;, it also &quot;influences or controls significant part of media agencies and outlets in the West&quot;
* &quot;Serving as the front squad of colonialism and neo-colonialism, international Zionism actively participates in the fight against national liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America&quot;
* &quot;A natural and objective assimilation process of Jews is growing around the world.&quot;

The official position of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and agencies was that Zionism was a tool used by the Jews and the Americans for &quot;racist imperialism.&quot; The meaning of the term &quot;Zionism&quot; was defined by the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union: &quot;the main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti-Communism and anti-Sovietism... overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR.&quot;

In his book &quot;A History of the Jews in the Modern World&quot;, Howard Sachar argues that the atmosphere of the Soviet &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; campaign in the wake of the Six-Day War was antisemitic, and even compares it to Nazism: 
&quot;In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Zionism as a &#x27;world threat.&#x27; Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an &#x27;all-powerful international force.&#x27; ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko&#x27;s notorious 1963 volume, &quot;Judaism Without Embellishment&quot;, were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov&#x27;s &quot;Beware: Zionism&quot;, a book essentially replicated &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, was given nationwide coverage.&quot;

A similar picture was drawn by Paul Johnson:
:the mass media &quot;all over the Soviet Union portrayed the Zionists (i.e. Jews) and Israeli leaders as engaged in a world-wide conspiracy along the lines of the old &quot;Protocols of Zion&quot;. It was, &quot;Sovietskaya Latvia&quot; wrote 5 August 1967, an &#x27;international Cosa Nostra with a common centre, common programme and common funds&#x27;&quot;.

The Israeli government was also referred to as a &quot;terrorist regime&quot; which &quot;has raised terror to the level of state politics.&quot; Even regarding the Entebbe hostage crisis, Soviet media reported: &quot;Israel committed an act of aggression against Uganda, assaulting the Entebbe airport.&quot;

Paul Johnson and other historians have also argued that United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 of 10 November 1975 that equated &quot;Zionism&quot; with &quot;racism&quot; was orchestrated by the Soviet Union. Resolution 3379 was pioneered by the Soviet Union and passed with numerical support from Arab, Muslim and African states amidst accusations that Israel was supportive of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Prior to the vote, US representative at the UN, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, warned of the impact of thus resolution, stating &quot;The UN is about to make antisemitism an international law.&quot; Though ten days before the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Soviet sponsored United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86 was adopted on 16 December 1991 which revoked the determination in
Resolution 3379.

On 1 April 1983, official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, &quot;Pravda&quot;, ran a full front-page article titled &quot;From the Soviet Leadership&quot;:&quot;By its nature, Zionism concentrates ultra-nationalism, chauvinism and racial intolerance, excuse for territorial occupation and annexation, military opportunism, cult of political promiscuousness and irresponsibility, demagogy and ideological diversion, dirty tactics and perfidy... Absurd are attempts of Zionist ideologists to present criticizing them, or condemning the aggressive politics of the Israel&#x27;s ruling circles, as antisemitic... We call on all Soviet citizens: workers, peasants, representatives of intelligentsia: take active part in exposing Zionism, strongly rebuke its endeavors; social scientists: activate scientific research to criticize reactionary core of that ideology and aggressive character of its political practice; writers, artists, journalists: fuller expose anti-populace and anti-humane diversionary character of propaganda and politics of Zionism.&quot;

Also, at the same time, the CPSU set up the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public as an anti-Zionist propaganda tool.

In March 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became the Secretary General of the CPSU and in April he declared perestroika. It took more than six years before Moscow consented to restore diplomatic relations with Israel on 19 October 1991, just 2 months before the collapse of the USSR and ten days before the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was one of the sponsors of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86 which was adopted on 16 December 1991 and revoked Resolution 3379 that had called Zionism a form of racism.

<text>Project Looking Glass is a now inactive free software project under the GPL to create an innovative 3D desktop environment for Linux, Solaris, and Windows. It was sponsored by Sun Microsystems.

Looking Glass is programmed in the Java language using the Java 3D system to remain platform independent. Despite the use of graphics acceleration features, the desktop explores the use of 3D windowing capabilities for both existing application programs and ones specifically designed for Looking Glass.

There is a Live CD available from Project Looking Glass. The Looking Glass environment is also included on a Live DVD (FunWorks 2007 edition) from the Granular Linux project.

== History ==
Looking Glass was first developed by Hideya Kawahara, a Sun programmer who wrote it in his spare time on a Linux laptop. After demonstrating an early version to Sun executives, he was assigned to it full-time with a dedicated team and open sourced the project. It was demonstrated by Jonathan Schwartz at LinuxWorld Expo 2003 in San Francisco.
After the demonstration, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called Schwartz&#x27;s office and told him that Apple would sue Sun if they moved forward to commercialize it – Jobs felt the project infringed Apple&#x27;s intellectual property.
Regardless of the threat, Sun determined that the project was not a priority and decided not to put more resource to develop it to product quality. The project continued in an experimental mode, but with Sun&#x27;s finances deteriorating, it became inactive in late 2006.

== Features ==

One of its most notable features is the creation of reversible windows. This capability can be used for features like allowing the user to write notes and comments on the windows&#x27; backs, or displaying application dialogs without risking their being detached from the application they relate to. All windows start by looking like a normal 2D or 2.5D window, but can be manipulated as thin slate-like 3D objects which can be set at any angle or turned completely around by the user.
Other features include tilting all the window to assist the user to pick up a desired window, provision of a panning virtual desktop, icons that reflect the live status of the window they represent and zooming of a window when it receives focus.

There are a few designs that Looking Glass implemented which appeared in other products in later years. One technique became popular by Apple&#x27;s Dashboard widgets is configuration of an application (widget) by flipping its visual and performing updates on the backside of it. The visual of Apple&#x27;s macOS Dock became similar to Looking Glass&#x27;s look when Leopard was released.
Windows 7 implements a feature for window selection that hides other windows than the one that the user placed the mouse cursor on a thumbnail above the taskbar. It resembles Looking Glass&#x27;s usage of transparency for window selection using window thumbnails on the taskbar.

== Similar projects ==
Looking Glass is similar to the TaskGallery prototype from Microsoft Research and the open source Croquet project based on Squeak in terms of allowance for the user to manipulate applications (including existing 2D applications) in a 3D space. However, user interaction models of TaskGallery and Croquet are based on virtual reality-like experience where the user moves inside the 3D space to perform tasks, whereas Looking Glass retains the operational model of today&#x27;s desktop (i.e. no walking around inside the 3D space) and uses 3D effects selectively where they are thought to be effective. Also, these three are similar as they are meant to work on adapted or enhanced versions of existing desktops rather than re-designing the entire graphical user interface from scratch, an approach taken by many Zooming User Interface projects such as the one created by Jef Raskin.

While many window managers (such as Microsoft&#x27;s Desktop Window Manager, the X Window System based Compiz, and macOS through Core Animation) can utilize 3D effects, these merely augment a conventional 2D environment.

<doc id="544919" wikidata="Q5324920" url="?curid=544919" title="Eadie–Hofstee diagram">
<text>In biochemistry, an Eadie–Hofstee plot (or Eadie–Hofstee diagram) is a graphical representation of the Michaelis–Menten equation in enzyme kinetics. It has been known by various different names, including Eadie plot, Hofstee plot and Augustinsson plot. Attribution to [[Barnet Woolf|Woolf]] is often omitted, because although Haldane and Stern credited Woolf with the underlying equation, it was just one of the three linear transformations of the Michaelis–Menten equation that they initially introduced. However, Haldane indicated in 1957 that Woolf had indeed found the three linear forms:In 1932, Dr. Kurt Stern published a German translation of my book &quot;Enzymes&quot;, with numerous additions to the English text. On pp. 119–120, I described some graphical methods, stating that they were due to my friend Dr. Barnett Woolf. [...] Woolf pointed out that linear graphs are obtained when formula_1 is plotted against formula_2, formula_3 against formula_4, or formula_5 against formula_6, the first plot being most convenient unless inhibition is being studied.

==Derivation of the equation for the plot==

The simplest equation for the rate formula_1 of an enzyme-catalysed reaction as a function of the substrate concentration formula_8 is the Michaelis-Menten equation, which can be written as follows:

:formula_9

in which formula_10 is the rate at substrate saturation (when formula_8 approaches infinity, or &quot;limiting rate&quot;, and formula_12 is the value of formula_8 at half-saturation, i.e. for formula_14, known as the &quot;Michaelis constant&quot;. Eadie and Hofstee transformed this into straight-line relationship. Multiplication of both sides by formula_15 gives: 

:formula_16

This can be directly rearranged to express a straight-line relationship:

:formula_17

which shows that a plot of formula_1 against formula_19 is a straight line with intercept formula_10 on the ordinate, and slope formula_21 (Hofstee plot).

In the Eadie plot the axes are reversed:

:formula_22

with intercept formula_23 on the ordinate, and slope formula_24.

These plots are kinetic versions of the Scatchard plot used in ligand-binding experiments.

==Attribution to Augustinsson==

The plot is occasionally attributed to Augustinsson and referred to the Woolf–Augustinsson–Hofstee plot or simply the Augustinsson plot. However, although Haldane, Woolf or Eadie were not explicitly cited when Augustinsson introduced the formula_1 versus formula_19 equation, both the work of Haldane and of Eadie are cited at other places of his work and are listed in his bibliography.

==Effect of experimental error==
Experimental error is usually assumed to affect the rate formula_1 and not the substrate concentration formula_8, so formula_1 is the dependent variable. As a result, both ordinate formula_1 and abscissa formula_19 are subject to experimental error, and so the deviations that occur due to error are not parallel with the ordinate axis but towards or away from the origin. As long as the plot is used for &quot;illustrating&quot; an analysis rather than for &quot;estimating the parameters&quot;, that matters very little. Regardless of these considerations various authors have compared the suitability of the various plots for displaying and analysing data.

==Use for estimating parameters==
Like other straight-line forms of the Michaelis–Menten equation, the Eadie–Hofstee plot was used historically for rapid evaluation of the parameters formula_12 and formula_10, but has been largely superseded by nonlinear regression methods that are significantly more accurate when properly weighted and no longer computationally inaccessible.

==Making faults in experimental design visible==

As the ordinate scale spans the entire range of theoretically possible formula_1 vales, from formula_35 to formula_10 one can see at a glance at an Eadie–Hofstee plot how well the experimental design fills the theoretical design space, and the plot makes it impossible to hide poor design. By contrast, the other well known straight-line plots make it easy to choose scales that suggest that the design is better than it is. Faulty design, as shown in the right-hand diagram, is common with experiments with a substrate that is not soluble enough or too expensive to use concentrations above formula_12, and in this case formula_38 cannot be estimated satisfactorily. The opposite case, with formula_8 values concentrated above formula_12 (left-hand diagram) is less common but not unknown, as for example in a study of nitrate reductase.

<text>Variomatic is the continuously variable transmission (CVT) of the Dutch car manufacturer DAF, originally developed by Hub van Doorne. It is a stepless, fully-automatic transmission, consisting of a V-shaped drive-belt, and two pulleys, each of two cones, whose effective diameter can be changed so that the &quot;V&quot; belt runs nearer the spindle or nearer the rim, depending on the separation of the cones. These are synchronized so that the belt always remains at the same optimal tension.

==History==
Patented by Fouillaron in 1898. “To solve a thorny weaving problem, the engineer developed a variator system that prevented the thread from cutting when starting the looms”.

In 1904, the Fouillaron type G tonneau road vehicle was equipped with a wooden Tonneau body and a De Dion 6 HP single-cylinder engine; the car did not exceed 25 km/h. This vehicle has a very original gear transmission system with extendable pulleys. This invention, which he further developed and adapted to machine tools, was later acquired by the Dutch car manufacturer DAF, and developed into the Variomatic transmission, since continued by a separate company called DVT.

The Variomatic was the first commercially successful CVT (as opposed to shifting between separate gears), first marketed on the DAF 600. In theory, this always produces the optimum torque. The Variomatic was introduced by DAF in 1958, also putting an automatic gearbox in the Netherlands for the first time.

==Efficiency==
Because most of the time the engine runs at its most economical speed, the fuel consumption of this car was acceptable, although the fuel efficiency of any mechanical CVT is about 70% (then) to 75% now (Bosch).

==Reversing==
Because the system does not have separate gears, but one (continuously shifting) gear and a separate &#x27;reverse mode&#x27; (as opposed to reverse gear), the transmission works in reverse as well, giving it the side effect that one can drive backwards as fast as forwards. As a result, in the former Dutch annual backward driving world championship, the DAFs had to be put in a separate competition because no other car could keep up. Thus, these very cheap and simple cars were the &#x27;formula one&#x27; in this competition.

==VDT==
Manual transmission remains dominant in Europe. When DAF was acquired by Volvo in 1974, the Variomatic patents were transferred to a company called VDT (Van Doorne Transmissie), later acquired by Bosch in 1995. VDT continued the development of the CVT and introduced a push-belt system in the Ford Fiesta and Fiat Uno.

==Operation==

===Gear ratio===
The final drive has two pulleys with moveable conical drums. The distance between the drums is controlled by the engine vacuum in the inlet manifold and engine RPM, through centrifugal weights inside the drums. Between the two pulleys runs a drive belt. As a result of the change in the distance of the conical drums in both pulleys, the diameters and so also the reduction ratio changes continuously.

===Differential===

With the DAF 600 - 55, each rear wheel was propelled individually by a pair of conical drums and drive belt with the effect of a limited-slip differential: if a drive wheel on slippery road revs up, the other wheel can still transfer the full torque. This results in unusually good traction characteristics, which were also a reason for the successes of the DAFs in rallying. There were several disadvantages that accompanied the lack of a true differential gear. Although each belt could settle (independent of the other) into its optimum position, thus allowing for wheel speed variation, the system was slow to operate and depended on the pulleys being turned. This led to rapid tire wear and placed stress on other transmission components. Snapped drive shafts were common. Low-speed handling in icy conditions was interesting as the system tended to drive the car forward against the influence of the steered wheels. Later cars, the 46, 66, and Volvo variants were fitted with a differentially geared axle. A version with a differential was developed by Williams in the 1993 Williams FW15C CVT Formula One car, but it was banned before being raced. In testing there were problems with the heat production.

==Motorscooters==
The Variomatic is also used in today&#x27;s motorscooters. It has been a standard part of all common scooters since 1985, and several companies such as Malossi, Polini, Doppler, and Stage6 are offering tuning clutches and variomatic for most common 50, 70 and 125 cc scooters.

==Steel link belts==
The modern CVT works according to the same principle of split pulleys allowing infinitely variable gear ratios. Rather than the pulled rubber drive belts as originally used by DAF, the modern transmission is made more durable by the use of steel link belts that are pushed by their pulleys. This improvement was pioneered by Fiat, Ford, and Van Doorne in the Netherlands from the late 1970s. The gearbox is also under electronic control.

One version that incorporates the switch from rubber to steel belts was called the Transmatic.

==Availability==
DAF&#x27;s Van Doorne&#x27;s Transmissie is still operating (as of November 2015) in Tilburg, Netherlands. It changed affiliations from the DAF group to Bosch in 1995.

The CVT is available from brands such as Audi, Honda, BMW Mini, and Subaru. Tata Motors from India intended to use a Variomatic transmission in its $2500 Nano. The Nissan Primera is offered with this transmission.

<doc id="544934" wikidata="Q132592" url="?curid=544934" title="Klebsiella pneumoniae">
<text>Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile, encapsulated, lactose-fermenting, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It appears as a mucoid lactose fermenter on MacConkey agar.

Although found in the normal flora of the mouth, skin, and intestines, it can cause destructive changes to human and animal lungs if aspirated, specifically to the alveoli, resulting in bloody, brownish or yellow colored jelly-like sputum. In the clinical setting, it is the most significant member of the genus &quot;Klebsiella&quot; of the Enterobacteriaceae. &quot;K. oxytoca&quot; and &quot;K. rhinoscleromatis&quot; have also been demonstrated in human clinical specimens. In recent years, &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species have become important pathogens in nosocomial infections.

It naturally occurs in the soil, and about 30% of strains can fix nitrogen in anaerobic conditions. As a free-living diazotroph, its nitrogen-fixation system has been much-studied, and is of agricultural interest, as &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; has been demonstrated to increase crop yields in agricultural conditions.

It is closely related to &quot;K. oxytoca&quot; from which it is distinguished by being indole-negative and by its ability to grow on melezitose but not 3-hydroxybutyrate.

==History==
The genus &quot;Klebsiella&quot; was named after the German microbiologist Edwin Klebs (1834–1913). It is also known as Friedlander&#x27;s bacillum in honor of Carl Friedländer, a German pathologist, who proposed that this bacterium was the etiological factor for the pneumonia seen especially in immunocompromised individuals such as people with chronic diseases or alcoholics.

Community-acquired pneumonia caused by &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; may occasionally be called &quot;Friedländer&#x27;s pneumonia&quot;.

==Epidemiology==
Illness most commonly affects middle-aged and older men more often than women with debilitating diseases. This patient population is believed to have impaired respiratory host defenses, including persons with diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, glucocorticoid therapy, kidney failure, and certain occupational exposures (such as papermill workers). Many of these infections are obtained when a person is in the hospital for some other reason (a nosocomial infection).

In addition to pneumonia, &quot;Klebsiella&quot; can also cause infections in the urinary tract, lower biliary tract, and surgical wound sites. The range of clinical diseases includes pneumonia, thrombophlebitis, urinary tract infection, cholecystitis, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, wound infection, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and bacteremia, and sepsis. For patients with an invasive device in their bodies, contamination of the device becomes a risk; neonatal ward devices, respiratory support equipment, and urinary catheters put patients at increased risk. Also, the use of antibiotics can be a factor that increases the risk of nosocomial infection with &quot;Klebsiella&quot; bacteria. Sepsis and septic shock can follow entry of the bacteria into the blood.

Research conducted at King&#x27;s College, London has implicated molecular mimicry between HLA-B27 and two &quot;Klebsiella&quot; surface molecules as the cause of ankylosing spondylitis.

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; ranks second to &quot;E. coli&quot; for urinary tract infections in older people. It is also an opportunistic pathogen for patients with chronic pulmonary disease, enteric pathogenicity, nasal mucosa atrophy, and rhinoscleroma. New antibiotic-resistant strains of &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; are appearing.

===&quot;Klebsiella&quot; pneumonia===

The most common condition caused by &quot;Klebsiella&quot; bacteria outside the hospital is pneumonia, typically in the form of bronchopneumonia and also bronchitis. These patients have an increased tendency to develop lung abscesses, cavitation, empyema, and pleural adhesions. It has a death rate around 50%, even with antimicrobial therapy.

====Pathophysiology====
It is typically due to aspiration and alcoholism may be a risk factor, though it is also commonly implicated in hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) individuals. In terms of the pathophysiology of &quot;Klebsiella&quot; pneumonia the neutrophil myeloperoxidase defense against &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; is often seen. Oxidative inactivation of elastase is involved, while LBP helps transfer bacteria cell wall elements to the cells.

====Signs and symptoms====
Individuals with &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; tend to cough up a characteristic sputum, as well as having fever, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; tends to affect people with underlying conditions, such as alcoholism.

====Diagnosis====
In terms of the diagnosis of &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; the following can be done to determine if the individual has this infection, with the addition of susceptibility testing to identify drug-resistant organisms:
*Blood culture
*CBC
*Sputum(culture)
*Radiography(chest)
*CT scan

====Treatment====
Treatment for &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; is by antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cephalosporins, the choice depending upon antibiotic susceptibility testing, the person&#x27;s health condition, medical history and severity of the disease.
&quot;Klebsiella&quot; possesses beta-lactamase giving it resistance to ampicillin. Many strains have acquired an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with additional resistance to carbenicillin, amoxicillin, and ceftazidime. The bacteria remain susceptible to aminoglycosides and some cephalosporins, and varying degrees of inhibition of the beta-lactamase with clavulanic acid have been reported. Infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens in the ICU have invoked the re-emergence of colistin. However, colistin-resistant strains of &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; have been reported in ICUs. In 2009, strains of &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; with gene called New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase ( NDM-1) that even gives resistance against intravenous antibiotic carbapenem, were discovered in India and Pakistan. &quot;Klebsiella&quot; cases in Taiwan have shown abnormal toxicity, causing liver abscesses in people with diabetes mellitus (DM); treatment consists of third generation cephalosporins.

===Hypervirulent &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;===
Hypervirulent (hvKp) is a rather recent &quot;K pneumoniae&quot; variant that is significantly more virulent than classical &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; (cKp). While cKp is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for nosocomial infections that usually affect immunocompromised patients, hvKp is clinically more concerning since it also causes disease in healthy individuals and can infect virtually every site of the body. The genetic traits that lead to this pathotype are included in a large virulence plasmid and potentially on additional conjugative elements.

These newly identified strains were described to overproduce capsule components and siderophores for iron acquisition, among other factors. Although initial studies showed that hvKp is rather susceptible to antibiotic treatment, it has been recently shown that such strains can acquire resistance plasmids and become multiresistant to a variety of antibiotics.

It originated from Asia, having a high mortality rate among the population. It often spreads to central nervous system and eye causing endophthalmitis, nonhepatic abscesses, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and meningitis. One visual trait of these strains is hypermucoviscous phenotype and a string test can be used to help the diagnosis. Further examinations and treatments are made on a case-by-case basis, as there are currently no international guidelines.

==Transmission==
To get a &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; infection, a person must be exposed to the bacteria. In other words, &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; must enter the respiratory tract to cause pneumonia, or the blood to cause a bloodstream infection.
In healthcare settings, &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; bacteria can be spread through person-to-person contact (for example, contaminated hands of healthcare personnel, or other people via patient to patient) or, less commonly, by contamination of the environment; the role of transmission directly from the environment to patients is controversial and requires further investigation. However, the bacteria are not spread through the air.
Patients in healthcare settings also may be exposed to &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; when they are on ventilators, or have intravenous catheters or wounds. These medical tools and conditions may allow &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; to enter the body and cause infection.

==Resistant strains==

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; organisms are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. Current evidence implicates plasmids as the primary source of the resistance genes. &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species with the ability to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) are resistant to virtually all beta-lactam antibiotics, except carbapenems. Other frequent resistance targets include aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
Infection with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is emerging as an important challenge in health-care settings. One of many CREs is carbapenem-resistant &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; (CRKP). Over the past 10 years, a progressive increase in CRKP has been seen worldwide; however, this new emerging nosocomial pathogen is probably best known for an outbreak in Israel that began around 2006 within the healthcare system there. In the US, it was first described in North Carolina in 1996; since then CRKP has been identified in 41 states; and is routinely detected in certain hospitals in New York and New Jersey. It is now the most common CRE species encountered within the United States.

CRKP is resistant to almost all available antimicrobial agents, and infections with CRKP have caused high rates of morbidity and mortality, in particular among persons with prolonged hospitalization and those critically ill and exposed to invasive devices (e.g., ventilators or central venous catheters). The concern is that carbapenem is often used as a drug of last resort when battling resistant bacterial strains. New slight mutations could result in infections for which healthcare professionals can do very little, if anything, to treat patients with resistant organisms.

A number of mechanisms cause carbapenem resistance in the Enterobacteriaceae. These include hyperproduction of ampC beta-lactamase with an outer membrane porin mutation, CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with a porin mutation or drug efflux, and carbapenemase production. The most important mechanism of resistance by CRKP is the production of a carbapenemase enzyme, &quot;blak&quot;pc. The gene that encodes the &quot;blak&quot;pc enzyme is carried on a mobile piece of genetic material (a transposon; the specific transposon involved is called Tn4401), which increases the risk for dissemination. CRE can be difficult to detect because some strains that harbor &quot;blak&quot;pc have minimum inhibitory concentrations that are elevated, but still within the susceptible range for carbapenems. Because these strains are susceptible to carbapenems, they are not identified as potential clinical or infection control risks using standard susceptibility testing guidelines. Patients with unrecognized CRKP colonization have been reservoirs for transmission during nosocomial outbreaks.

The extent and prevalence of CRKP within the environment is currently unknown. The mortality rate is also unknown, but has been observed to be as high as 44%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance for aggressive infection control to combat CRKP:

:&quot;Place all patients colonized or infected with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae on contact precautions. Acute-care facilities are to establish a protocol, in conjunction with the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, to detect nonsusceptibility and carbapenemase production in Enterobacteriaceae, in particular &quot;Klebsiella&quot; spp. and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and immediately alert epidemiology and infection-control staff members if identified. All acute-care facilities are to review microbiology records for the preceding 6–12 months to ensure that there have not been previously unrecognized CRE cases. If they do identify previously unrecognized cases, a point prevalence survey (a single round of active surveillance cultures) in units with patients at high risk (e.g., intensive-care units, units where previous cases have been identified, and units where many patients are exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobials) is needed to identify any additional patients colonized with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing &quot;Klebsiella&quot; spp. and &quot;E. coli&quot;. When a case of hospital-associated CRE is identified, facilities should conduct a round of active surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to the CRE case (e.g., those patients in the same unit or patients having been cared for by the same health-care personnel).&quot;

In 2019, there were 192,530 global deaths attributed to resistant strains of &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;.

=== Local outbreaks ===
Israel 2007–2008. A nationwide outbreak of CRE in Israel peaked in March 2007 at 55.5 cases per 100,000 patient days and necessitated a nationwide treatment plan. The intervention entailed physical separation of all CRE carriers and appointment of a task force to oversee efficacy of isolation by closely monitoring hospitals and intervening when necessary. After the treatment plan (measured in May 2008), the number of cases per 100,000 patient days decreased to 11.7. The plan was effective because of strict hospital compliance, wherein each was required to keep detailed documentation of all CRE carriers. In fact, for each increase in compliance by 10%, incidence of cases per 100,000 patient days decreased by 0.6. Therefore, containment on a nationwide scale requires nationwide intervention.

Nevada 2016. In mid-August 2016, a resident of Washoe County was hospitalized in Reno due to a CRE (specifically &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;) infection. In early September of the same year, she developed septic shock and died. On testing by CDC an isolate from the patient was found to be resistant to all 26 antibiotics available in the US, including drug of last resort colistin. It is believed she may have picked up the microbe while hospitalized in India for two years due to a broken right femur and subsequent femur and hip infections.

== Antimicrobial resistance gene transfer ==
&quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; carries a large number of anti-microbial resistance genes (AMR genes). These genes are transferred via plasmids from and to other human pathogens. One human pathogen that commonly acquires AMR genes from &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; is &quot;Salmonella&quot;. This could help with treatment of salmonella infections due to having knowledge of possible antibiotic resistance data.

The majority of AMR genes in &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; are plasmid-borne. An example of a niche would be soil, often considered a hotspot for gene transfer.
The table shows the number of AMR genes and plasmids (per strain or subspecies) compared to other common bacteria species.

==Prevention==
To prevent spreading&quot; Klebsiella&quot; infections between patients, healthcare personnel must follow specific infection-control precautions, which may include strict adherence to hand hygiene (preferably using an alcohol based hand rub (60–90%) or soap and water if hands are visibly soiled. Alcohol based hand rubs are effective against these Gram-negative bacilli) and wearing gowns and gloves when they enter rooms where patients with &quot;Klebsiella&quot;-related illnesses are housed. Healthcare facilities also must follow strict cleaning procedures to prevent the spread of &quot;Klebsiella&quot;.

To prevent the spread of infections, patients also should clean their hands very often, including:
* Before preparing or eating food
* Before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth
* Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages
* After using the restroom
* After blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing
* After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls, or the phone

==Treatment==
&quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; can be treated with antibiotics if the infections are not drug-resistant. Infections by &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; can be difficult to treat because fewer antibiotics are effective against them. In such cases, a microbiology laboratory must run tests to determine which antibiotics will treat the infection. More specific treatments of &quot;Klebsiella&quot; pneumonia are given in its section above. For urinary tract infections with multidrug-resistant &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species, a combination therapy with amikacin and meropenem has been suggested.

==Research==
Multiple drug-resistant &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; strains have been killed &quot;in vivo&quot; by intraperitoneal, intravenous, or intranasal administration of phages in laboratory tests. Resistance to phages is not likely to be as troublesome as to antibiotics as new infectious phages are likely to be available in environmental reservoirs. Phage therapy can be used in conjunction with antibiotics, to supplement their activity instead of replacing it altogether.

==Vaccine development==
New data sources outlining the global burden of &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; and drug-resistant forms are expected to build momentum into prophylactic vaccine development. The recent 2022 IHME study showed that in 2019 &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; was responsible for 790,000 deaths [571,000–1,060,000] in all age groups across 11 infectious syndromes. Importantly, in Sub-saharan Africa &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; was responsible for 124,000 [89,000–167,000] neonatal deaths due to bloodstream infections. Based on these and other data, a newly developed prophylactic vaccine would ideally be designed to prevent invasive &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; disease in both vulnerable persons but also as a maternal vaccine to prevent neonatal sepsis and global demand assessments have been published. As of June 2023, one single clinical development program for a &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; vaccine [Kleb4V/GSK4429016A] was in a Phase 1/2 study in healthy adults aged 18–70 yrs (n=166) [Clinical trials identifier: NCT04959344]. The vaccine is an O-antigen based conjugate where the specific O-antigens in the vaccine remain undisclosed [Michael Kowarik, LimmaTech Biologics, World Vaccine Congress EU, 2022] although only a limited number of O-serotypes can account for a high proportion of clinical isolates. A recent Q1 2024 GSK Corporate R&amp;D pipeline update showed that Kleb4V/GSK4429016A had been removed. The status of the program is now subject to verification.

<doc id="544943" wikidata="Q653078" url="?curid=544943" title="Whipple's disease">
<text>Whipple&#x27;s disease is a rare systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium &quot;Tropheryma whipplei&quot;. First described by George Hoyt Whipple in 1907 and commonly considered as a gastrointestinal disorder, Whipple&#x27;s disease primarily causes malabsorption, but may affect any part of the human body, including the heart, brain, joints, skin, lungs and the eyes. Weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and arthritis are common presenting symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable in certain individuals, and about 15% of patients do not have the standard signs and symptoms.

Whipple&#x27;s disease is significantly more common in men, with 87% of patients diagnosed being male. When recognized and treated, Whipple&#x27;s disease can usually be cured with long-term antibiotic therapy, but if the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, it can ultimately be fatal.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms are diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and joint pains. The joint pains may be due to migratory nondeforming arthritis, which may occur many years before any digestive-tract symptoms develop; they tend to involve the large joints, but can occur in any pattern and tend not to damage the joint surface to the point that the joint becomes deformed. Fever and chills occur in a small proportion of people.

In its more advanced form, malabsorption (insufficient absorption of nutrients from the diet) leads to wasting and the enlargement of lymph nodes in the abdomen. Neurological symptoms (discussed below) are more common in those with the severe form of the abdominal disease. Chronic malabsorptive diarrhea leads to the poor absorption of fat, causing steatorrhea (fatty, offensive-smelling stool), flatulence, and abdominal distension. Protein-losing enteropathy may also occur, causing depletion of albumin, a blood protein, which may lead to peripheral edema caused by the lowered oncotic pressures.

Hyperpigmentation of the skin occurs in almost half; some also have skin nodules. Various eye problems, such as uveitis, may occur; this is typically associated with deteriorating vision and pain in the affected eye. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valve) has been reported in a small number of cases, sometimes in people with no other symptoms of Whipple&#x27;s disease; this is typically noticed as breathlessness and leg swelling due to fluid accumulation as the heart is unable to pump fluid through the body.

Of those affected by Whipple&#x27;s disease, 10–40% have problems related to the involvement of the brain; the symptoms relate to the part of the brain that is affected. The most common problems are dementia, memory loss, confusion, and decreased level of consciousness. Eye-movement disturbances and myorhythmia (rapidly repetitive movements of the muscles) of the face, together referred to as oculomasticatory myorhythmia, are highly characteristic for Whipple&#x27;s disease. Weakness and poor coordination of part of the body, headaches, seizures, and a number of more uncommon neurological features are present in some cases.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;T. whipplei&quot; is one of the Actinomycetes, and is a distant relative of the &quot;Mycobacterium avium complex&quot;, explaining in part why Whipple&#x27;s disease is similar to the diseases caused by MAC bacteria. The disease is common in farmers and those exposed to soil and animals, suggesting that the infection is acquired from these sources.

Individuals who are most susceptible to the disease are those with decreased ability to perform intracellular degradation of ingested pathogens or particles, particularly within macrophages. Several studies indicate that defective T-lymphocyte (particularly TH1 population) function may be an important predisposing factor for the disease. In particular, circulating cells which are CD11b (also known as integrin alpha) expressive are reduced in susceptible individuals. CD11b has a vital role in activation of macrophages to destroy intracellularly ingested &quot;T. whipplei&quot; bacteria.

== Diagnosis ==

Common clinical signs and symptoms of Whipple&#x27;s disease include diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, migratory arthropathy, fever, and neurological symptoms. Weight loss and diarrhea are the most common symptoms that lead to identification of the process, but may be preceded by chronic, unexplained, relapsing episodes of nondestructive seronegative arthritis, often of large joints.

Endoscopy of the duodenum and jejunum can reveal pale yellow shaggy mucosa with erythematous eroded patches in patients with classic intestinal Whipple&#x27;s disease, and small bowel X-rays may show some thickened folds. Other pathological findings may include enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, hypercellularity of lamina propria with &quot;foamy macrophages&quot;, and a concurrent decreased number of lymphocytes and plasma cells, per high power field view of the biopsy.

Diagnosis is made by biopsy, usually by duodenal endoscopy, which reveals PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria containing nonacid-fast, Gram-positive bacilli. Immunohistochemical staining for antibodies against &quot;T. whipplei&quot; has been used to detect the organism in a variety of tissues, and a polymerase chain reaction-based assay is also available, which can be confirmatory if performed on blood, vitreous fluid, synovial fluid, heart valves, or cerebrospinal fluid. PCR of saliva, gastric or intestinal fluid, and stool specimens is highly sensitive, but not specific enough, indicating that healthy individuals can also harbor the causative bacterium without the manifestation of Whipple&#x27;s disease, but that a negative PCR is most likely indicative of a healthy individual.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is with penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, or co-trimoxazole for one to two years. Any treatment lasting less than a year has a relapse rate around 40%. Expert opinion as of 2007 is that Whipple&#x27;s disease should be treated with doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine for 12 to 18 months. Hydroxychloroquine increases antibiotic and bactericides activity against the replication of the bacteria in acidic vacuoles of macrophages by increasing the macrophage intraphagosomal pH. Sulfonamides (sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole) may be added for treatment of neurological symptoms.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is regarded as extremely rare, with an incidence (new number of cases per year) of one case per million people. The patients are predominantly male, with various studies and sources typically reporting a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1 of male to female patients. In the United States and some other countries, it occurs predominantly in those of Caucasian ethnicity, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition in that population. &quot;T. whipplei&quot; appears to be an environmental organism that is commonly present in the gastrointestinal tract, but remains asymptomatic. Several lines of evidence suggest that some defect—inherited or acquired—in immunity is required for it to become pathogenic. The possible immunological defect may be specific for &quot;T. whipplei&quot;, since the disease is not associated with a substantially increased risk of other infections. The disease is usually diagnosed in middle age (median 49 years). Studies from Germany have shown that age at diagnosis has been rising since the 1960s.

==History==
Whipple described the disease in 1907 in a paper in the now-defunct &quot;Bulletin of Johns Hopkins Hospital&quot;. The patient was a 36-year-old medical missionary. Whipple referred to the disease as &quot;intestinal lipodystrophy&quot;. It was long presumed to be an infectious disease, but the causative organism was only fully identified in 1992. In 2003, doctors from Johns Hopkins Hospital, together with the French microbiologist Didier Raoult applied novel diagnostic methods to stored tissue samples from Whipple&#x27;s original patient, and demonstrated &quot;T. whipplei&quot; in these tissues.

<doc id="544947" wikidata="Q6012914" url="?curid=544947" title="In the Skin of a Lion">
<text>In the Skin of a Lion is a novel by Canadian–Sri Lankan writer Michael Ondaatje. It was first published in 1987 by McClelland and Stewart. The novel fictionalizes the lives of the immigrants who played a large role in the building of the city of Toronto in the early 1900s, but whose contributions never became part of the city&#x27;s official history. Ondaatje illuminates the investment of these settlers in Canada, through their labour, while they remain outsiders to mainstream society. &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot; is thus an exposé of the migrant condition: &quot;It is a novel about the wearing and the removal of masks; the shedding of skin, the transformations and translations of identity.&quot;

An important aspect of the novel is its depiction of Toronto in the 1930s. Ondaatje spent many months in the archives of the City of Toronto and newspapers of the era. Prominence is given to the construction of two Toronto landmarks, the Prince Edward Viaduct, commonly known as the Bloor Street Viaduct, and the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, and focuses on the lives of the immigrant workers. The plot incorporates a number of true stories of the time, such as the fall of a nun from a bridge, the disappearance of Ambrose Small, the political suppression of Police Chief Draper, and the murder of labour union organizers Rosvall and Voutilainen.

In a minor section of the novel, Patrick Lewis visits Paris, Ontario in which Ondaatje describes various parts of the town including: Broadway Street, Wheelers Needleworks, Medusa, Paris Plains, just north of the town, the Arlington hotel, and Paris Public Library.

The novel&#x27;s title is taken from a line in &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh,&quot; following the death of Enkidu. It is located in the epigraph as &quot;I will let my hair grow long for your sake, I will wander through the wilderness in the skin of a lion,&quot; echoing the theme of converging voices re-telling history.

The book was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English Language Fiction in 1987. Ondaatje&#x27;s more famous 1992 novel, &quot;The English Patient&quot;, is, in part, a sequel to &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot;, continuing the characters of Hana and Caravaggio as well as revealing the fate of this novel&#x27;s main character, Patrick Lewis.

==Plot summary==

===Book One===

====Little Seeds====
The first chapter, &quot;Little Seeds,&quot; describes the growing years of the main character, Patrick Lewis, providing causation for his subsequent actions in the novel. As a young boy in Depot Creek, Ontario, Patrick watches the loggers arrive in town in the winter, work in the mills in the other seasons, and skate on the frozen river. Patrick&#x27;s father, Hazen Lewis, becomes a dynamiter and is meticulous when washing his clothes each evening to remove remnants of explosives on his apparel. These elements form the foundation of the subsequent narrative: Depot Creek, the loggers skating, learning about dynamite, etc.

====The Bridge====
&quot;The Bridge&quot; deals with the construction of the Bloor Street Viaduct, which will link eastern Toronto with the centre of the city and will carry traffic, water and electricity across the Don Valley. R.C. Harris, the city&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Works often visits the bridge at night. One night, five nuns wander onto the unfinished bridge and one falls off. Nicholas Temelcoff, a Macedonian immigrant worker on the bridge, saves the nun who fell off the bridge, dislocating his arm. The nun, already missing her veil, tears her habit to make him a sling. Later, at a bar, he offers her brandy, compliments, and a new lease on life. Temelcoff is a silent man who struggles with English yet they are able to transcend their social and language barriers through the commonality of their scars— his from work, hers from being &quot;always unlucky.&quot; This moment is the beginning of the nun&#x27;s eventual transformation into the character Alice. He eventually falls asleep and wakes to find a doctor treating his arm and the nun gone.

====The Searcher====
As a young man, Patrick leaves the profession that killed his father and sets out to find the vanished millionaire Ambrose Small. This leads him to Small&#x27;s mistress Clara Dickens and to a relationship with her. Eventually, Patrick loses interest in finding Small, hoping only to remove Clara from Small. Clara tells Patrick that she will leave him to go after Small and warns him not to follow her. Patrick is broken-hearted. Three years later, Clara&#x27;s friend Alice unexpectedly arrives and tells Patrick that Clara&#x27;s mother might know where Clara is. Patrick sets out to search for Clara. On meeting Clara&#x27;s mother, Patrick learns that Clara and Small are living in his old hometown. Patrick finds Small living in a house owned by a timber company, and Small attempts to set him on fire—once by dropping kerosene on him and then by throwing a Molotov cocktail. Patrick escapes to his hotel room and is visited by Clara, who dresses his wounds and makes love to him before returning to Small.

===Book Two===

====Palace of Purification====
In 1930, Patrick is working as a dynamiter on a tunnel under Lake Ontario, a project of Commissioner Rowland Harris. Patrick rents an apartment in a Macedonian neighborhood. He is accepted into the neighborhood and is invited by Kosta, a fellow dynamiter, to a gathering at the Waterworks—a place where various nationalities gather for secret political discussions and entertainment. Patrick witnesses a performance in which an actor repeatedly smashes her hand against the stage and rushes forward to help her. He recognizes her as Alice Gull. His act of helping her turns out to be part of the show. Patrick visits Alice and learns about Hana, her nine-year-old daughter. Patrick and Alice become lovers. Patrick finds work in a leather company through Alice&#x27;s friends and meets Nicholas Temelcoff, now a baker. On studying the bridge, Patrick learns about the nun that had fallen off, whose body was never found. He makes the connection after talking with Temelcoff and promises to look after Hana.

====Remorse====
Patrick travels by train, north of Huntsville, then takes a steamer to a Muskoka hotel frequented by the rich. He burns down the hotel, then escapes on a small boat, traveling to the next island, where he meets the blind Elizabeth. We learn that Alice has died suddenly and that Patrick committed the arson out of anger. Patrick swims out to a boat, knowing he will be caught by the authorities.

===Book Three===

====Caravaggio====
In the Kingston Penitentiary, Patrick and two other prisoners, Buck and Caravaggio, are painting the roof. Patrick and Buck paint Caravaggio in the blue of the roof so he can hide and escape. He steals new clothes and changes his dressing. Jumping a milk train, he makes his way north toward cottage country. He has a scar from an attack from which Patrick saved him by yelling out a square dance call. Caravaggio recalls his first robbery, in the course of which he broke his ankle while retrieving a painting, so he had hidden in a mushroom factory where a young woman named Giannetta helped him recover, with whom he had escaped by dressing as a woman. Caravaggio enters the cottage of a woman whom he met on the lake and calls his wife to let her know he&#x27;s all right. After talking to the cottage owner, he returns to his brother-in-law&#x27;s house, reuniting with Giannetta.

====Maritime Theatre====
Four years later, Patrick is released from prison and meets Temelcoff at the Geranium Bakery. Hana, now sixteen, has been living with Temelcoff&#x27;s family. Patrick takes responsibility for Hana. One night, she wakes him to say that Clara Dickens has called. She tells him that Small is dead and asks him to pick her up from Marmora.

Realizing that the water supply is vulnerable to being cut off or poisoned, Harris installs guards at the Waterworks, which he built. Caravaggio introduces Patrick to his wife. They fraternize at a party for the rich, then steal a multimillion-dollar yacht from a couple they chloroform. Patrick intends to blow up the Filtration Plant with dynamite and Caravaggio&#x27;s help. Patrick enters the plant through the water intake. He places dynamite about the plant testing facility and carries the detonating box to Harris&#x27; office, where he accuses Harris of exploiting the workers and ignoring their plight. Patrick tells Harris how Alice Gull was killed and we learn that she accidentally picked up the wrong satchel, containing a bomb. Exhausted, Patrick falls asleep, and in the morning Harris asks the police to defuse the bombs and bring a nurse for Patrick.

Patrick awakes and goes with Hana to retrieve Clara. At Hana&#x27;s urging, Patrick tells her about Clara. Patrick asks Hana to drive to Marmora. The book ends with &quot;&#x27;Lights&#x27; he said.&quot;

== Analysis ==
This novel is categorized thematically as post-colonial, as it is largely concerned with the native cultures and languages of immigrants in Canada. Additionally, the structure of the novel may be described as postmodern in that Ondaatje uses the integration of different voices, images, and re-organization of time to tell these stories.

Watson and McLeod note the use of a &quot;searcher-figure&quot; in Patrick, and by extension the narrator of the story, who act as observers finding &quot;&#x27;truths&#x27;&quot; in order to construct a cohesive history representative of all the parts that created it.

Devi draws on Ondaatje&#x27;s use of converging narratives to uncover the vastly different experiences of immigrants in Canada, and symbolize the overarching issue of how their unofficial history is erased from the official histories.

== Themes and motifs ==
The novel&#x27;s title is taken from a line in &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, following the death of Enkidu. It is located in the epigraph as &quot;I will let my hair grow long for your sake, I will wander through the wilderness in the skin of a lion,&quot; echoing the theme of converging voices re-telling history. Diogenes is quoted at the climax of the third act, &quot;[i]n a rich man&#x27;s house there is nowhere to spit except in his face.&quot; Earlier in the third act, the character Caravaggio is described as keeping a dog to assist him in his burglaries because he does not trust anyone else. Throughout the book, light (from a lantern, flaming cattails and other sources) and darkness plays heavily in the context of the main characters and development of the plot, i.e., illumination of the Finnish loggers, moonlight, when Caravaggio is learning to become a thief in total darkness, Patrick&#x27;s removal of the lamp when breaking into the water plant, the lights being turned off during the final dialogue between Patrick and Harris. The color blue is also mentioned often, especially during Caravaggio&#x27;s escape from prison to help him camouflage himself against the blue prison roof. The idea of &quot;demarcation&quot; is emphasized by Caravaggio to Patrick.

==Awards and recognition==
*Nominated for the 1987 Governor General&#x27;s Award for English Language Fiction.
*&quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot; championed by Steven Page, won the 2002 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;.
*The City of Toronto Archives prepared a special tour of its collection of historic photos, taken by Arthur Goss, tailored for students reading &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot;, as Ondaatje&#x27;s research for the novel was influenced by studying the photos.
*In 2009, a passage from &quot;The Bridge&quot; was placed at the Bloor Street Viaduct in Toronto, becoming the inaugural &quot;bookmark&quot; for Project Bookmark Canada, and marking the beginning of Canada&#x27;s literary trail.

<doc id="544950" wikidata="Q4916108" url="?curid=544950" title="Birds of Pray">
<text>Birds of Pray is the seventh studio album by Live, released in 2003. The first single, &quot;Heaven&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful single in several years, reaching number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Birds of Pray&quot; was Live&#x27;s final release on Radioactive/MCA. They signed with Epic in 2005.

==Background==
Ed Kowalczyk&#x27;s lyrics on this album return to the spiritual territory of &quot;The Distance to Here&quot;. Guitarist Chad Taylor explained that the tensions between Kowalczyk and the other three members that eventually caused the band to split from him surfaced in 1999, and had grown worse during the album&#x27;s recording sessions. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure how our rocker fanbase would feel about the lyrics.&quot; He expressed his frustration with the album by adding, &quot;Jim Wirt (producer) worked really hard to fashion a contemporary album, but it never felt like the Live I loved.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Birds of Pray&quot; debuted at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 37,000 copies in its first week of release. By August 2005 it had sold 273,000 copies in the US. The album failed to reach gold status in the US, although it outsold 2001&#x27;s &quot;V&quot;. The album received mixed reviews from critics and has a rating of 50 out of 100 on Metacritic.

AllMusic disliked Kowalczyk&#x27;s lyrics, claiming they were &quot;Either too literal or bewilderingly obtuse&quot; and said that the album was, &quot;Still recognizably Live...big, big guitars, sweeping anthemic choruses, earnest ballads, mildly histrionic vocals...but it&#x27;s a little more subdued and a little more serious and quite streamlined...The biggest problem with the record is that the eye is on the big picture...to the extent that the individual moments aren&#x27;t all that memorable, clearly lacking singles as forceful as those that fueled &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;.&quot; AllMusic concluded by claiming that, &quot;Live is growing up and settling down, turning into a solid thirty-something rock band.&quot;

<text>The United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA) is a national organization for amateur soccer in the United States. It consists of 54 state associations in four regions, as well as national, regional, and state leagues. It compares to the United States Youth Soccer Association and its 54 affiliated State Associations - as it was once all one bodied structure.

== History ==
The USASA was founded in 1982 at the first meeting of the Senior Division of the United States Soccer Federation. Later that year, the United States Soccer Federation reorganized and the senior division became a separate member. The USASA has been known as United States Senior Soccer Division, the United States Soccer Association, the United States Amateur Soccer Association, and finally its current name of the United States Adult Soccer Association.

=== Presidents ===
==Mission==
Under the five guiding values of transparency, inclusiveness, integrity, diversity and tradition, the mission of the USASA is: 
* Administer Adult Soccer through safe and positive play
* Provide competition and programs
* Identify governance and administrative best practices
* Promote education and training
* Promote the vision &quot;Soccer-your game for life&quot;
* Develop a unified soccer community
* Assist member organizations and local communities

== Organization ==
USASA is governed by an executive committee composed of a president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, four regional directors, two at-large members, affiliate director and an independent director.

USASA is organized into four regions — Region I, Region II, Region III, and Region IV which breakdown into the 54 affiliated state associations. In addition to these state associations, USASA&#x27;s rules provide for national leagues and regional leagues. National Leagues must extend across all four time-zones, have 36 teams and play for a minimum of three months. Finally, USASA rules also provide for multi-state leagues which span four states, involve sixteen teams, and play for at least three months per year.

USASA has one men&#x27;s national league, the National Premier Soccer League, and two women&#x27;s national leagues, the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League and United Women&#x27;s Soccer. USASA&#x27;s multi-state leagues are Cascadia Premier League, Eastern Development Program, Eastern Premier Soccer League, Gulf Coast Premier League, Mountain Premier League, National Independent Soccer Association, Southwest Premier League, and West Coast Soccer Association.

=== State Premier Leagues ===

State and local associations operate leagues under the umbrella of the USASA. The national organization is split into four regions:
===Affiliated Amateur Adult Leagues===
==Competitions==

=== The USASA National Amateur Cup ===

The National Amateur Cup is the most prestigious and longest running tournament for all of amateur soccer in the entire country, crowning its first champion, Fleisher Yarn in 1924.

To qualify for the national tournament a team must win their respective regional cup. The winner of this tournament is awarded the Fritz Marth Amateur Cup. In addition to the trophy the winner of the National Amateur Cup is awarded an entry into both the Hank Steinbrecher Cup, and the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup, which has been in existence since 1914.

=== Hank Steinbrecher Cup ===
In 2013, USASA and U.S. Soccer began a competition to pit the champions of the different men&#x27;s amateur competitions (USASA National Amateur Cup, National Premier Soccer League, USL League Two and defending Hank Steinbrecher Cup holder) against each other for the title of &quot;Champions of Champions&quot; The competition eventually allowed in other champions such as those from the United Premier Soccer League, United States Specialty Sports Association and the USASA Werner Fricker champion.

<text>Throwing Copper is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Live, released on April 26, 1994, on former MCA Records subsidiary Radioactive Records. It was produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads and was recorded at Pachyderm Recording Studio. &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; has generally been regarded as Live&#x27;s best album, having sold over 8 million copies and certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==Cover art==
The cover art is a painting by Scottish artist Peter Howson titled &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;. On September 23, 2005, it was sold for $186,000 by Christie&#x27;s in New York. The painting is oil on canvas and measures .

==25th anniversary reissue==
In May 2019, the band announced a 25th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;, which was released on July 19. The reissue contains three bonus tracks: &quot;Hold Me Up&quot;, which was recorded during the original &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; sessions and later heard in the 2008 comedy &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; but was not officially released; &quot;We Deal in Dreams&quot;, which had been released as a single off the band&#x27;s 2004 compilation album &quot;&quot;; and &quot;Susquehanna&quot;, another previously unreleased track originally recorded in 1993, though it had been written during recording sessions for the band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Mental Jewelry&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Throwing Copper&quot; has typically been regarded as Live&#x27;s strongest album. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review stated that the band &quot;strive for an epic sound&quot; and successfully execute on that goal; retrospective reviews have been similarly positive, with the &quot;Jakarta Post&quot; describing the album as &quot;a solid beast from front to back&quot; and uDiscoverMusic characterizing it as &quot;challenging, yet commendably powerful&quot;. The instrumentation on the album has been generally praised: &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered the musicians to be &quot;expert players [who] drop musical smart bombs with unerring precision&quot;, and the &quot;Jakarta Post&quot; referred to the music as &quot;absolutely dynamic and catchy&quot;. Singer Ed Kowalczyk was applauded for his vocal performance as well, with a retrospective &quot;Stereogum&quot; review noting his ability to &quot;raise his voice from a plaintive hush to a clenched roar&quot;.

The lyrics of the album received more mixed reviews. The &quot;Jakarta Post&quot; felt that &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; &quot;managed to push earnestness and wild esotericism as far as it could go without feeling resoundingly cheesy&quot;, but Gina Boldman of AllMusic was more negative, stating that the album&#x27;s &quot;melodrama [is] a bit much&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot; described Kowalczyk&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;mystic gibberish&quot; that nevertheless featured &quot;memorably inscrutable turns of phrase&quot;.

A 2024 review by Paolo Ragusa of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; credits this album with starting post-grunge and shifting rock music to a new direction after the death of Kurt Cobain by combining some harder rock influences with clearer vocals, softer guitar melodies, and the production of Jerry Harrison to make a distinct sound.

<doc id="544970" wikidata="Q705405" url="?curid=544970" title="Yoshitarō Nomura">
<text>}

 was a prolific Japanese film director, film producer, and screenwriter. His first accredited film, , was released in 1952; his last, , in 1985. He received several awards during his career, including the Japanese Academy Award for &quot;Best Director&quot; for his 1978 film &quot;The Demon&quot;.

==Biography==
Nomura was the son of Hotei Nomura, a contract film director at the Shochiku film studio. He entered Keio University to study art in 1936, graduated in 1941, and then joined the Shochiku studios as well. He was first hired as an assistant director but before being assigned any projects he was drafted into the army before being discharged in July 1946. In the fall of the same year, he returned to Shochiku and spent his entire film career working there. 

During his years as an assistant director, he worked under the helm of film directors such as Keisuke Sasaki, Yuzo Kawashima, and Akira Kurosawa, whom he worked with in 1951 on the filming of &quot;The Idiot&quot;, based on the novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. In 1952, Nomura was promoted to director and made his directorial debut in 1953 with the film , which was such a success that the studio gave him five more films to direct the following year.

He is considered one of the pioneers of Japanese film noir and frequently collaborated with mystery writer Seichō Matsumoto, adapting eight of his works into films. Nomura directed 89 films in total. He worked in several different genres, including musicals and &quot;jidaigeki&quot; (period dramas), but was considered most proficient within the thriller genre. Nomura&#x27;s films frequently contain veiled criticism of Japanese society. His 1974 thriller &quot;Castle of Sand&quot;, for which he won a diploma at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival in 1975, is considered by many critics as his best work. Nomura retired from directing in 1985, after which he worked as a TV producer and as consultant to other Japanese directors. In 1995, he was decorated by the Japanese Government with the Order of the Rising Sun, the second highest order of Japan. 

He died of pneumonia on 8 April 2005 in Shinjuku, Tokyo.

==Retrospective==
In 2014, the National Science and Media Museum in the UK organised a programme of five Nomura films, all of which were adaptations of Seichō Matsumoto stories.

<text>Orhei (), also formerly known as Orgeev (), is a city, municipality and the administrative centre of Orhei District in the Republic of Moldova, with a population of 21,065. Orhei is approximately north of the capital, Chișinău.

==History==

Orhei takes its name from the Hungarian Őrhely, , as it was an outpost of the Hungarian army guarding the &quot;gyepű&quot;. It was the Ottoman-occupied military center of northern Bessarabia until it was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1812. The word &quot;orhei&quot; was used by local population, meaning &quot;strengthened hill, fortress, deserted courtyard&quot;. The name &quot;Orhei&quot; is, derived from the Hungarian word Őrhely or Várhely, the earlier meaning &quot;lookout post&quot;, dating from the 13th century, when Hungarian forces built a series of defences in the area. Orhei gets its name from Orheiul Vechi, an active monastery near the village of Ivancea.

Like the rest of Bessarabia, Orhei was taken by the Kingdom of Romania after World War I. During World War II, it was annexed by the USSR in 1940. In 1941, Romania recaptured the town, however, it was re-occupied by the USSR on 6 April 1944, during the Uman–Botoșani Offensive, and was rebuilt after the war. In 1991 it became part of the Republic of Moldova.

In 1990s Orhei was the leader of the &quot;romanization&quot; process.

Prior to 2003, Orhei was the capital of Orhei County, a large administrative region, but the country was divided further into Raion, or districts.

The St. Dumitru Church built by Vasile Lupu is located in this town.

Ilan Shor was elected mayor in 2015; he served until 2019. Pavel Verejanu won the 2019 mayoral election in 2019, with about 80% of the vote. Verejanu was Shor&#x27;s preferred candidate.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Orhei amounted to 21,065 inhabitants (making it the ninth largest city in Moldova), a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 25,641 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 10,032 were men and 11,033 were women.


&quot;Footnotes&quot;:

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

While Orhei was still within Bessarabia, the population in 1920 was estimated to be 25,000. At that time, two-thirds of the population were Jewish. The remaining population was Russian, Romanian and Ruthenians.

==Religion==
Orhei was home to many Jews prior to World War II, and has a large Jewish cemetery. There is only one active synagogue left in the community. The main churches are Romanian Orthodox and Russian Orthodox. Also in the area are: Baptist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Salvation Army, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

==Economy==

Orhei was the first place in what was then known as Bessarabia, to have a successful tobacco industry. The area is also known for wine production.

==Sport==
FC Milsami Orhei is based in the city. The team won the Moldovan National Division in 2015.

==Media==
Orhei has two local radio stations:
Radio Orhei (101.6 FM) founded in 2005, contains news from region and republic. In 2018, its name was cloned by a broadcaster affiliated to the Șor Party – Radio Orhei FM (97.5 FM). Radio Orhei FM broadcasts news from the Orhei region, Moldova national news, international news, and Russian, Moldovan, and Romanian music. 
There is also an Orhei City Hall site.

<doc id="544984" wikidata="Q957076" url="?curid=544984" title="The World of Null-A">
<text>The World of Null-A, sometimes written The World of Ā, is a 1948 science fiction novel by Canadian-American writer A. E. van Vogt. It was originally published as a three-part serial in 1945 in &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. It incorporates concepts from the general semantics of Alfred Korzybski. The name Ā refers to non-Aristotelian logic.

==Plot summary==
Gilbert Gosseyn (pronounced &quot;go sane&quot;), a man living in an apparent utopia where those with superior understanding and mental control rule the rest of humanity, wants to be tested by the giant Machine that determines such superiority. However, he finds that his memories are false. In his search for his real identity, he discovers that he has extra bodies that are activated when he dies (so that, in a sense, he cannot be killed), that a galactic society of humans exists outside the Solar system, a large interstellar empire wishes to conquer both the Earth and Venus (inhabited by masters of non-Aristotelian logic), and he has extra brain matter that, when properly trained, can allow him to move matter with his mind.

==Publication history==
The novel originally appeared as a serial entitled &quot;The World of Ā&quot; in the August 1945 to October 1945 issues of the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, which was edited by John W. Campbell, Jr.

Van Vogt significantly revised and shortened the tale for the 1948 novel release. Like the serial, the 1948 hardcover (Simon &amp; Schuster) and the 1950 hardcover (Grosset &amp; Dunlap) editions were entitled &quot;The World of Ā&quot;. To reduce printing costs, the 1953 and 1964 Ace Books paperback editions were entitled &quot;The World of Null-A&quot;, and the symbol Ā was replaced with &quot;null-A&quot; throughout the text. The 1970 revision kept this change, added some brief new passages to chapters 10, 24, and 35, and also included a new introduction in which van Vogt defended the controversial work, but also admitted that the original serial had been flawed.

==Critical reception==

It won the Manuscripters Club Award. It was listed by the New York area library association among the hundred best novels of 1948. &quot;World of Null-A&quot; has been translated into nine languages, and when first published, created the French Science Fiction Market all by itself - according to Jacques Sadoul, editor of &quot;Editions OPTA&quot;. &quot;The World of Null-A&quot; finished second in the Retro Hugo award voting for Best Novel of 1945 presented in 1996 at L.A.con III.

For many years, two quotes appeared on the paperback editions of this novel. &quot;Without doubt one of the most exciting, continuously complex and richly patterned science fiction novels ever written!&quot; - Groff Conklin; and &quot;One of those once-in-a-decade classics!&quot; - John Campbell.

In 1945, the novel was the subject of an extended critical essay by fellow author and critic Damon Knight. In the review, which was later expanded into &quot;Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt&quot;, Knight writes that &quot;far from being a &#x27;classic&#x27; by any reasonable standard, &quot;The World of Ā&quot; is one of the worst allegedly-adult science fiction stories ever published.&quot; Knight criticizes the novel on four main levels: 
In his author&#x27;s introduction to the 1970 revised edition, van Vogt acknowledges that he has taken Knight&#x27;s criticisms seriously, thus the reason for his revising the novel so many years after its original publication.

In 1974 Damon Knight walked back his original criticisms:

==Sequels==
&quot;The World of Null-A&quot; was followed by the sequel, &quot;The Pawns of Null-A&quot; (also known as &quot;The Players of Null-A&quot;, 1956), and much later by a follow-up, &quot;Null-A Three&quot; (1984).

In 2008 John C. Wright wrote a novel as new chapter to the story of Gilbert Gosseyn, &quot;Null-A Continuum&quot;, in the style of van Vogt.

<doc id="545000" wikidata="Q331937" url="?curid=545000" title="The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late">
<text>&quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late&quot; is J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s imagined original song behind the nursery rhyme &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle (The Cat and the Fiddle)&quot;, invented by back-formation. It was first published in &quot;Yorkshire Poetry&quot; magazine in 1923, and was reused in extended form in the 1954–55 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a song sung by Frodo Baggins in the &quot;Prancing Pony&quot; inn. The extended version was republished in the 1962 collection &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;. 

Scholars have noted that Tolkien liked to imitate medieval works, and that the light-hearted poem fits into a reworking by Tolkien of the &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; tradition. This tradition consisted of myths such as that of Phaethon who drove the Sun too close to the Earth, down through a medieval story of the unlucky man who was banished to the Moon, and ultimately to a short nursery rhyme. Tolkien similarly wrote a myth of the creation, with the Sun and Moon carried on ships across the sky; and a story of an Elf who hid on the ship of the Moon, so as to create a multi-layered effect within his writings similar to the real medieval tradition.

The song has been set to music and recorded by The Tolkien Ensemble. In the extended edition of Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, the Dwarf Bofur sings it at Elrond&#x27;s feast in Rivendell. A rewritten version is sung in Kevin Wallace and Saul Zaentz&#x27;s 2006 musical theatre production of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Context==

=== Tolkien ===

J. R. R. Tolkien, known as the author of fantasy books on Middle-earth including the bestselling 1937 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the 1954-55 fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, was a professional philologist, specialising in the understanding of the words used in medieval manuscripts such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;. He was a professor of English Language at the University of Leeds, and then at the University of Oxford, where he taught at Pembroke College.

Tolkien wrote two Man in the Moon poems, both related to traditional verses. They are &quot;The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late&quot;, the latter according to Tolkien &quot;derived ultimately from Gondor ... based on the traditions of Men&quot;. They are both included in the short collection of Tolkien&#x27;s verse, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, with the frame story of being poems enjoyed by hobbits.

Early in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, at &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; inn at Bree, the protagonist Frodo Baggins jumps on a table and recites &quot;a ridiculous song&quot; supposedly invented by his cousin Bilbo. &quot;Here it is in full&quot;, said Tolkien, alluding to the shortness of the nursery rhyme. &quot;Only a few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered.&quot;

=== Nursery rhyme ===

The original &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot; nursery rhyme, on which Tolkien&#x27;s song is based, may date back to the sixteenth century or earlier. Some sources suggest it may be a thousand or more years old: a cat playing a fiddle was a popular image in early medieval illuminated manuscripts.

=== Harley lyrics ===

An unnamed Middle English poem in Harley Manuscript no. 2253 is known under the modern English name &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;. Tolkien was aware of the poem, and may have wanted to connect it in some way to his stories, though he does not use the Middle English poem&#x27;s central theme, a thornbush. The poem begins:

== Song ==
The song is written in 13 stanzas. The first five introduce the characters of the &quot;Hey diddle diddle&quot; nursery rhyme, and add the Man in the Moon and an inn complete with its ostler and landlord. The last eight stanzas embellish the nursery rhyme; the poetry teachers Collette Drifte and Mike Jubb write that Tolkien use them to enliven the tale with &quot;detail, character, and with fun in his mastery of the language&quot;. 

=== Structure ===

The rhythm is a &quot;jaunty&quot; pattern of iambic feet in the five-line stanzas, in the pattern of 4-3-4-4-3 feet in the lines. The rhyming scheme is UABBA. Tolkien makes use of many poetic devices in the poem, such as alliteration, anthropomorphism, assonance, and internal rhyme. Tolkien varies the metre slightly from the strict iambic in &quot;They rolled the Man slowly up the hill&quot;. Literary techniques include personification and simile. The &quot;merry old inn&quot; is contrasted with the &quot;grey hill&quot;, the cat&#x27;s fiddle is appropriately &quot;purring low&quot;, while the round Man in the Moon is twice described as rolling.

=== Story ===

Tolkien chooses to set the song&#x27;s story in the context of &quot;a merry old inn&quot; with fine beer to attract the Man in the Moon. The song introduces each element of the original nursery rhyme in turn: the Man in the Moon in the first stanza, the musical cat in the second, the little dog in the third, the hornéd cow in the fourth, and the silver dishes and spoons in the fifth. 

The story proper begins with the sixth stanza, with the Man in the Moon &quot;drinking deep&quot; and the cat wailing. Now is the moment for the dish and the spoon to dance &quot;on the table&quot;, as the cow and the little dog start rushing about. Stanza seven sees the Man in the Moon drink another mug of ale, and fall asleep &quot;beneath his chair&quot;. This is the cue for the ostler to tell his &quot;tipsy cat&quot; that the Man in the Moon needs to be woken up, and in the ninth stanza, the cat &quot;on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, a jig that would wake the dead&quot; and the landlord tries without success to wake the dozing Man.

Abandoning the attempt, they instead roll the Man back &quot;up the hill&quot; into the Moon, followed by the dish who &quot;ran up with a spoon&quot;. The cat plays faster and faster, and all the inn&#x27;s guests barring the Man himself &quot;bounded from their beds&quot; and danced. Stanza twelve sees the cat&#x27;s frenzied playing break the fiddle&#x27;s strings, and &quot;the little dog laughed to see such fun&quot; while &quot;the Saturday dish went off at a run / with the silver Sunday spoon&quot;, expanding upon the last of the original nursery rhyme&#x27;s words. Finally, the Moon rolls &quot;behind the hill&quot; as the Sun rises, astonished to see everyone going back to bed.

=== Publication history ===

The 1923 version was written long before either of Tolkien&#x27;s hobbit novels, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, were planned. This version was called &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle: or A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked&quot;.

The version of the song printed in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is slightly longer, at thirteen ballad-like five-line stanzas. Shippey writes that Tolkien was in effect &quot;raiding his own larder&quot; for suitable materials. This version was republished, with a new title, in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;.

==Reception==

=== An imagined prehistory of poetry ===

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that nobody would call &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late&quot; a serious poem. All the same, he cites it and its mate, &quot;The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon&quot; (also from 1923, also subsequently included in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;), as typical examples of Tolkien&#x27;s working strategy for reconstructing philological information about sources now lost. In this case, the question is what the history is behind the abbreviated version of this poem that survives as a well-known but nonsensical nursery rhyme. By imagining a text that might reasonably have left the surviving rhyme, one can deduce clues that might have left other artefacts in surviving literature. Shippey argues that many of the scenarios in Tolkien&#x27;s more serious work are similar recreations (asterisk&#x27; poems&quot; in Shippey&#x27;s phrase), attempting to explain abstruse passages in surviving Old English and Old Norse texts. The seemingly frivolous nursery rhymes are taken to have

Steven M. Deyo, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, endorses Shippey&#x27;s suggestion of an imagined prehistory of the nursery rhyme, where

=== Performance versus folklore transmission ===

The Tolkien scholar Dimitra Fimi writes that Tolkien is clearly setting Frodo&#x27;s song apart as a performance of a traditional work. She states that readers quickly appreciate that Frodo&#x27;s performance of an entertaining but &quot;ridiculous song&quot;, supposedly written by his cousin Bilbo, is evidently &quot;a highly sophisticated and literary derivative of the &#x27;real world&#x27; nursery rhyme &#x27;The Cat and the Fiddle. This stands in sharp contrast with Sam Gamgee&#x27;s recital of &quot;The Stone Troll&quot;, at once amusing and &quot;metrically intricate&quot;, which the other hobbits make clear is new. It is clear, writes Fimi, that Sam, despite his basic education, must have created it; it has &quot;the rare quality of impromptu improvisation modelled upon traditional forms, a quality that many traditional folksingers display&quot;.

=== Multi-layered tradition ===

The medievalist Thomas Honegger writes that Tolkien gives the theme of the Man in the Moon a &quot;multi-layered treatment&quot; that gives it a &quot;complexity and depth&quot; comparable with the actual folk tradition that reaches back some eight centuries, spanning the 14th-century Middle English &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; poem in the Harley Lyrics, which he quotes at length with a parallel translation. The &quot;nonsensical nursery rhymes&quot; about the Man in the Moon inspired Tolkien&#x27;s two poems (&quot;... Stayed Up Too Late&quot; and &quot;... Came Down Too Soon&quot;). Honegger comments that Christopher Tolkien seems to have been uncomfortable, even embarrassed, by the &quot;low&quot; folklore aspect of his father&#x27;s Man in the Moon poetry, though his father, far from feeling discomfort, was happy to hint at a long and varied tradition through his stories and poems. At the &quot;high mythology&quot; level, he writes, the Old Norse myth of Máni corresponds to Tolkien&#x27;s creation myths with the ships which carry Sun and Moon (Tilion) across the heavens. At the level of story, the tale of an unlucky fellow banished to the moon roughly matches (Honegger writes) Tolkien&#x27;s old elf Uole Kuvion who hid on the Ship of the Moon &quot;and has been living there ever since&quot;.

=== Medieval borrowings ===

John D. Rateliff notes that Tolkien stated that when he read a medieval work, he wanted to write a modern one in the same tradition. He constantly created these, whether pastiches and parodies like &quot;Fastitocalon&quot;; adaptations in medieval metres, like &quot;The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun&quot; or &quot;asterisk texts&quot; like his &quot;The Cat &amp; The Fiddle&quot;; and finally &quot;new wine in old bottles&quot; such as &quot;The Nameless Land&quot; and Aelfwine&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;. The works are extremely varied, but all are &quot;suffused with medieval borrowings&quot;, making them, writes Rateliff, &quot;most readers&#x27; portal into medieval literature&quot;. Not all found use in Middle-earth (as &quot;The Cat &amp; The Fiddle&quot; eventually did), but they all helped Tolkien develop a medieval-style craft that enabled him to create his attractively authentic Middle-earth legendarium. Hyde writes that the poem was at first a humorous commentary on the plentiful &quot;&#x27;nonsense&#x27; that had been written&quot; about &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot;.

== Settings ==

The Danish Tolkien Ensemble recorded the song on their 1997 CD of settings of songs from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;An Evening in Rivendell&quot;. It was set by Caspar Reiff and Peter Hall. 
Af Søren Aabyen, reviewing the album for the Danish Tolkien Association, praised the &quot;playful hobbit-song&quot;. Steve Renard recorded his version online for Signum University, with sheet music.

Peter Jackson does not have Frodo sing the song in his film of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, but in the extended edition of the 2012 film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, the Dwarf Bofur sings it at Elrond&#x27;s feast in Rivendell. 

In Kevin Wallace and Saul Zaentz&#x27;s 2006 musical theatre production of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, presented in Toronto and London, the hobbits Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Sam, and the Breelanders sing a version of the song as &quot;The Cat and the Moon&quot;, cut down to 4-line stanzas with a different metre. Shaun McKenna&#x27;s lyrics were set to music by A. R. Rahman as the fourth musical number, and performed by the Finnish band Värttinä.

<doc id="545001" wikidata="Q1353795" url="?curid=545001" title="Vehicle blind spot">
<text>A blind spot in a vehicle or vehicle blind spot is an area around the vehicle that cannot be directly seen by the driver while at the controls, under existing circumstances. In transport, driver visibility is the maximum distance at which the driver of a vehicle can see and identify prominent objects around the vehicle. Visibility is primarily determined by weather conditions (see visibility) and by a vehicle&#x27;s design. The parts of a vehicle that influence visibility include the windshield, the dashboard and the pillars. Good driver visibility is essential to safe road traffic.

==Conditions for blind spots==
Blind spots exist in a wide range of vehicles: aircraft, cars, buses, trucks, agricultural equipment, heavy equipment, boats, ships, trams and trains. Blind spots may occur in the front of the driver when the A-pillar (also called the windshield pillar), side-view mirror, or interior rear-view mirror block a driver&#x27;s view of the road. Behind the driver, cargo, headrests, and additional pillars may reduce visibility. Proper adjusting of mirrors and using other technical solutions can eliminate or alleviate vehicle blind spots.

A no zone is one of several areas around a large truck, where the truck driver cannot see. Collisions frequently occur in no zones.

A blind zone is one of several areas around heavier rolling stocks (locomotives and multiple units), where the train driver cannot see. Accidents frequently occur in blind zones.


==Adjusting mirrors to reduce side blind spots==
The side view mirrors of a car should be adjusted to reduce blind spots on the sides. The method is frequently overlooked in driver&#x27;s education classes and takes some getting used to. Calculated elimination of blind spots by properly trained drivers is inexpensive and obviates the need for costly technological solutions to that problem, provided drivers take the time to set up and use their mirrors effectively. The arrangementpointing the side-view mirrors substantially outboard in a fixed mechanical formulais relatively simple to achieve. Still, it takes some knowledgeable effort and getting used to it. It is reputed to be a lifesaver.

However, one source considers that method a driving mistake and claims it is even more dangerous than not using it, because it creates other blind spots directly behind the vehiclenine reasons are listed, &quot;e.g.&quot;, when backing upwhich are impossible to eliminate by a &quot;shoulder check&quot;.

Rearward invisibility is an entirely different matter. The area directly behind vehicles is the source of backup collisions, particularly involving pedestrians, children, and objects directly aft of a vehicle. That area has been called a &quot;killing zone&quot;. These problems are the object of several technological solutions, including (in rough order of technological complexity, simplest first): rear-view mirror, side-view mirror, Fresnel lens, sonar, parking sensors, and backup camera. A similar problem attaches to positions left and right of a vehicle&#x27;s rear bumper as the driver attempts to back out of a parking space. Specially designed cross-traffic alert warning systems have been developed to address these.

== Motor vehicles ==
As one is driving an automobile, blind spots are the areas of the road that cannot be seen while looking forward or through either the rear-view or side mirrors (expecting that the side mirrors are properly adjusted on a passenger auto see above). The most common are the &quot;rear quarter blind spots,&quot; areas towards the rear of the vehicle on both sides. Vehicles in the adjacent lanes of the road that fall into these blind spots may not be visible using only the car&#x27;s mirrors. Rear quarter blind spots can be:
* checked by turning one&#x27;s head briefly (risking rear-end collisions),
* reduced by installing mirrors with larger fields-of-view, or
* eliminated by reducing overlap between side and rear-view mirrors by adjusting side mirrors so the side of the car is barely visible when your head is between the front seats (for the passenger-side mirror) and almost touching the driver&#x27;s window (for the driver-side mirror), then checking to be sure you can see cars approaching from behind on either side when on the highway.

Other areas that are sometimes called blind spots are those that are too low to see behind, in front, or to the sides of a vehicle, especially those with a high seating point.

===Forward visibility===

This diagram shows the blocked view in a horizontal plane in front of the driver. The front-end blind spots caused by this can create problems in traffic situations, such as in roundabouts, intersections, and road crossings. Front-end blind spots are influenced by the following design criteria:

*Distance between the driver and the pillar
*Thickness of the pillar
*The angle of the pillar in a vertical plane side view
*The angle of the pillar in a vertical plane front view
*the form of the pillar is straight or arc-form
*Angle of the windshield
*Height of the driver about the dashboard
*Speed of the opposite car

The front left side A-pillar (not shown in the illustration) also causes blind spot issues when a car approaches a pedestrian crossing while a pedestrian is crossing the street left to right.

===Types of A-pillar design===
Most passenger cars have a diagonal pillar in the side view. The angle between the horizon and A-pillar is approximately 40 degrees with a straight pillar that is not too thick. This gives the car a strong, aerodynamic body with an adequately sized front door.

====Panoramic vertical A-pillars====
The sides of a panoramic windshield are curved, which makes it possible to design vertical A-pillars that give the driver maximum forward visibility. However, it is impossible to design an aerodynamic small car with a vertical A-pillar because the more vertical the A-pillar is, the less space the door opening has, and the greater frontal area and coefficient of drag the vehicle will have.

Examples of cars with an almost vertical A-pillar:
*Honda Step Bus Concept
*Saab 900
*School bus
*Almost all Cadillacs from 1954 to 1959

====Flat A-pillar design====
Some modern car designs have an extremely flat A-pillar angle with the horizon. For example, the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro from 1993 to 2002 had a windshield angle of 68° with the vertical, which equals just 22° with the horizon.

A flatter A-pillar&#x27;s advantages include reducing the overall drag coefficient and making the car body stronger in a frontal collision, at the expense of reducing driver visibility in a 180° field of view from left to right. A flatter A-pillar (and therefore windscreen) is also a factor when calculating the effects of a collision with a pedestrian. In general, a flatter angle will result in a more gentle impact, directing the pedestrian &quot;up and over&quot; rather than directly into the windscreen. This is particularly true for cars like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class which also have a low angled engine cover.

=====Other disadvantages of a flat windshield angle=====

*Other traffic can not see the driver through the reflection if the driver can see them.
*The heater needs more time to heat the bigger window surface.
*The flat windshield angle does not let the snow slide off easily.
*The driver cannot reach the whole flat window to clean it easily.
===Height of the driver===
Driver height can also affect visibility.

An A-pillar that is split up and has a small triangle window (Front Quarter glass) can give short driver visibility problems.
In some cars, the windshield is fillet with the roof-line with a big radius.
A fillet round A-pillar can give a tall driver visibility problems. Also sometimes the A-pillar can block the driver from seeing motorcyclists.

Also, the B-pillar can block the vision of a tall driver in small 4-door cars.

A driver may reduce the size of a blind spot or eliminate it by turning their head in the direction of the obstruction. This allows the driver to see better around the obstruction and allows the driver better depth perception.

===Visibility in a convertible===
Because there is no roof connection between the A- and B-pillars, the A-pillars of a convertible automobile have to be stronger and even thicker.

However, with the top down there are no B or C pillars, improving visibility behind the driver.

===Windshield reflections===
====Dashboard reflection====
It is best if the dashboard has a non-reflecting dark-colored surface.

A small dashboard gives some reflection on the lower part of the windshield.

A big dashboard can give a reflection on eye height.

====A-pillar reflection====
It is best if the inside of the A-pillar has a non-reflecting dark-colored surface.

If the side of the window is curved there is less A-pillar reflection.

===Light through roof reflection===
Some new model cars have a very big sunroof. Sometimes the sunlight through the roof lights up the dashboard and gives a reflection in the windshield.

===Other automobile design factors===
Other design factors may prevent a manufacturer from maximizing visibility. These include safety, as narrower pillars cannot be made strong as easily as thicker pillars, and size restraints about aerodynamics, as taller, more vertical windshields create additional drag and reduce fuel efficiency. They also include fashion and cost, whereby design and appearance considerations can be deemed preeminent.

Side radar systems offer better performance and also warn of fast-approaching vehicles entering the blind spot.

==Trams and trains==

Blind spots also exist around trams (streetcars/trolleys) and trains (locomotives with railway carriages and multiple units).
Heavier rolling stocks can have up to several meters of blind spot. This is generally known as the dead visual range of a train. To address this, cameras are sometimes placed around the train driver&#x27;s cab to cover the missing field of view during coupling/decoupling between locomotives and railcars, multiple units, special railway equipments or another locomotives.

==Agricultural equipment==
Blind spots also exist around agricultural equipment (utility tractors, combine harvesters, etc.).

==Heavy equipment==
Blind spots also exist around heavy equipment (excavators, bulldozers, wheel loaders, cranes, etc.).

== Boats and ships ==

Blind spots also exist in front of boats and ships. When the boat accelerates, the bow rises, increasing the size of the blind spot. Large vessels can have up to several hundreds of meters of blind spots. This is generally known as the dead visual range of a ship. To address this, cameras are sometimes placed in the front of the vessel to cover the missing field of view.

Blind spots exist where areas behind the sail are obscured from the view of a helmsman on a sailboat or windsurfer. This is especially true when they are heeled over; consequently, transparent windows are sometimes sewn into the sails.

==Aircraft==
Blind spots also exist around aircraft (helicopters, airships, airplanes, gliders). When the aircraft (airplane) accelerates for take off, the size of the blind spot below fuselage increases. Heavier aircraft can have up to several meters of blind spots. This is generally known as the dead visual range of an aircraft. To address this, cameras are sometimes placed in the front of the aircraft to cover the missing field of view.

== Semi Trucks ==
For large semi-trucks, their blind spots are large as the truck is tall and long. A semi-truck&#x27;s blind spots, also known as &quot;no zones&quot; include directly in front of the vehicle, directly behind the vehicle, and directly alongside both sides of the vehicle, especially the non-driver side. To stay safe from these areas, make sure to avoid them, but if not possible, safely presume as fast as possible back into line of sight. Pay attention to the truck&#x27;s signals, and let them turn into a lane instead of speeding up to pass them.

<text>Julian Alden Weir (August 30, 1852 – December 8, 1919) was an American impressionist painter and member of the Cos Cob Art Colony near Greenwich, Connecticut. Weir was also one of the founding members of &quot;The Ten&quot;, a loosely allied group of American artists dissatisfied with professional art organizations, who banded together in 1898 to exhibit their works as a stylistically unified group.

==Biography==
Weir was born on August 30, 1852, the second to last of sixteen children, and raised in West Point, New York. His father was painter Robert Walter Weir, a professor of drawing at the Military Academy at West Point who taught such artists as James Abbott McNeill Whistler. His older brother, John Ferguson Weir, also became a well-known landscape artist who painted in the styles of the Hudson River and Barbizon schools. He was professor of painting and design at Yale University from 1869, starting the first academic art program on an American campus. His niece was artist and educator Irene Weir.

In 1874, Weir shared a studio at 5 Rue de Pont de Lodi in Paris with Finnish artist Albert Edelfelt, who would become a lifelong friend. The two studied together at the École des Beaux-Arts under Jean-Léon Gérôme.

Julian Weir received his first art training at the National Academy of Design in the early 1870s before enrolling at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1873. His peers included Finnish painter Albert Edelfelt with whom he shared a studio and would become a lifelong friend. While in France he studied under the famous French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme, and became good friends with Jules Bastien-Lepage. Weir also encountered impressionism for the first time, and reacted strongly: &quot;I never in my life saw more horrible things...They do not observe drawing nor form but give you an impression of what they call nature. It was worse than the Chamber of Horrors.&quot; He complained about the Impressionists in a letter from April 15, 1877, to his parents saying, &quot;They do not observe drawing nor form but give you an impression of what they call nature&quot;. As a conservative academic painter at this stage in his career, Weir was esteemed by his European peers during his training years.

Weir met James McNeill Whistler in London before returning to New York City in 1877. Upon his return to NYC, Weir became a charter member of the Society of American Artists and continued exhibiting his work at the National Academy of Design, where he first displayed his paintings in 1875. He earned wages through portrait commissions and teaching art classes at the Cooper Union Women&#x27;s Art School, the Art Students League and in private classes.

His works as a young artist centered on still life and the human figure, which he rendered in a realist style not unlike the work of Édouard Manet. This was supported by the fact that Weir purchased two paintings by Manet during the summers of 1880 and 1881, &quot;Woman with a Parrot&quot; and &quot;Boy with a Sword&quot;, for the New York collector Erwin Davis. It was clear by then that Weir was beginning to lose his previous staunch loathing for French Impressionism.

In the 1880s Weir moved to rural Wilton, Connecticut, after having acquired farm property, now the Weir Farm National Historic Site, through his marriage to Anna Baker in 1883. While here, he strengthened his friendship with artists Albert Pinkham Ryder and John Henry Twachtman. The art of Weir and Twachtman was especially well aligned, and the two sometimes painted and exhibited together. Both taught at the Art Students League. In 1889, the two artists exhibited and sold a large portion of their paintings at Ortgies Gallery in New York. Weir was also close friends with the still life and landscape painter Emil Carlsen who summered with Weir on his farm, before purchasing his own home in Falls Village, Connecticut. The pastoral setting of his farms often feature in his paintings. They were a healthy escape from the hustle and bustle of urban New York City. Weir loved working in the city, but it often became too much for him to bear. Branchville and Windham served as comfortable getaways. According to art historian Hollis Clayson, &quot;Life on the street could often frustrate and aggravate, but contemplated from far off, experienced exclusively as a visual phenomenon, it could satisfy&quot;.

By 1891 Weir had reconciled his earlier misgivings about impressionism and adopted the style as his own. His one-man show at the Blakeslee gallery in the same year clearly displayed his newfound affinity for the Impressionist style. His work demonstrated a tendency for a lighter palette of pastel colors and broken brushwork akin to the Impressionists. His wife Anna died in 1892, but Weir remarried her sister, Ella Baker, the same year. By this new marriage, he inherited another farm in Windham, CT. This new site was now his rightful property, but it was not the first time he had ever seen the Windham farm. He had been there with Anna in years past. On his first stop there in 1882, the beautiful farm and surrounding village made quite an impact on him. He had this to say: &quot;This is really the first Connecticut village that I have really ever known, &amp; now I feel that a charm is connected with all villages, such as I have read of but never appreciated&quot;

Weir gained further notoriety and in 1893, the American Art Association grouped his works together with those by Twachtman for a comparative exhibit with pieces done by Claude Monet and Paul Besnard. Such a prestigious event meant that the art world had taken notice of the American brand of Impressionism. Furthermore, Weir felt compassion for those who lost their jobs in the 1893 depression. Railroad bankruptcies led to unemployed workers, but Weir helped raise money for them with painting exhibitions.

During the remainder of his life Weir painted impressionist landscapes and figurative works, many of which centered on his Connecticut farms at Branchville and Windham. His style varied from traditional, vibrant impressionism to a more subdued and shadowy tonalism. He also became skilled at etching. As a rule, his paintings done after 1900 showed a renewed interest of the academicism prevalent in the work of his younger days, with subjects treated less realistically and a greater emphasis placed on drawing and design.

In 1897, Weir became a member of the Ten American Painters, generally known as The Ten, a group of painters who left the Society of American Artists in late 1897 to protest what they saw as the overemphasis on Classical and Romantic Realism over Impressionism by the Society. The Ten exhibited for twenty years until its demise, due to the death of members and the prominence of newer styles.

In 1912 Weir was selected the first president of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, but resigned a year later following the association&#x27;s sponsorship of the modernist Armory Show. Weir later became president of the National Academy of Design. He was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1916 until his death in 1919. He was an early member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was interred at Windham Center Cemetery in Windham, Connecticut.

Among Weir&#x27;s pupils was the painter Harriet Campbell Foss.
==Legacy==

The most critically acclaimed painting by Weir is &quot;The Red Bridge&quot; from 1895. It is a technical masterpiece, displaying a truss bridge that spanned the Shetucket River down the street from Weir&#x27;s Windham farm. He used complementary colors to unite the image with equal tonal quality and to depict the realistic reflection of the bridge seen on the water. While there is pictorial unity in the piece, Weir contrasted the bridge and its surrounding setting by placing the red bridge against the greens of woods and the blues of water and sky and by juxtaposing the geometric man-made bridge with the natural sinuous curves of the trunks and branches.

Today Weir&#x27;s paintings are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D. C.; Brigham Young University&#x27;s Museum of Art, Provo, Utah; the Portland Art Museum in Portland, Oregon; and the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut. Weir&#x27;s farm and studio at Branchville are protected as the Weir Farm National Historic Site; the Weir family continues ownership of the Windham farm. His papers are in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Archives of American Art.

<text>Operation Ostra Brama (, ) was the Polish Home Army&#x27;s attempted takeover of Vilnius () in wake of the German &quot;Wehrmacht&#x27;s&quot; evacuation, ahead of the approaching Soviet Red Army&#x27;s Vilnius offensive. A part of a Polish national uprising, Operation Tempest, the action happened on 7–13 July 1944. The operation&#x27;s main goal was propagandistic – to claim Vilnius for Poland by retaking it before Soviet arrival. Despite the operation&#x27;s failure, the Polish government-in-exile continued its political line that led to the catastrophic Warsaw Uprising on 1 August 1944.

== Background ==

=== June 1944: Plans for uprising ===
On June 12, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Army, ordered the preparation of a plan to seize Vilnius from German hands. The Home Army&#x27;s Vilnius and Nowogródek districts planned to conquer the city before the Soviets did. Lieutenant Colonel Aleksander Krzyżanowski, who commanded the Home Army&#x27;s Vilnius District, regrouped all the region&#x27;s partisan units for the assault, both from inside and outside of the city.

Operation Ostra Brama was meant to be carried out during an expected state of confusion among German units in Vilnius, faced with the impending arrival of major Soviet forces. Instead, the Germans held strong positions in the fortified city. On June 26, major and lieutenant colonel proposed a plan to Krzyżanowski. &#x27;Ostra Brama order number 1&#x27; comprised an overall outline for an assault on Vilnius, where the Home Army forces of the combined districts Vilnius and Nowogródek would strike from the outside under the lead of Lieutenant Colonel &quot;Poleszczuk&quot;.

Units inside the city were under the command of Lieutenant Colonel &quot;Ludwik&quot;. According to the plan, the main attack was prepared from the east and southeast for July 8. When the Red Army crossed the front, equivalent to where it was in 1916 (between Soly and Smarhon), the uprising would begin.

=== Allied diplomacy before the battle ===
Poland had already lost its eastern territories to Stalin at the Tehran Conference, but none of the Polish soldiers that were going to fight in the Battle of Vilnius knew about it. However, the Polish government-in-exile knew fully about the Western Allies&#x27; support for the Soviet position. For example, on April 25, 1944, during a meeting of British Prime Minister Churchill with , a leading member of the Polish National Party, and General Stanisław Tatar, the deputy chief of staff of the Home Army.&quot;He [Berezowski] said that the Poles trusted Great Britain and her Prime Minister and counted on his staunch and firm support in ensuring Poland&#x27;s real independence and the integrity of her frontiers. Churchill said that while he was willing to assist Poland in regaining her independence he could not vouch for the integrity of her frontiers; he reaffirmed his support for the Curzon Line, surrendering Wilno and Lwów to Russia and compensating Poland in the West. Berezowski responded with an emphatic re-statement of Poland&#x27;s determination to keep Wilno and Lwów, and if necessary to fight for them. Churchill answered &#x27;in a grave...even...gloomy, manner: &quot;Obviously, a decision to resist, regardless of the consequences, is the privilege of every nation, and it cannot be denied even to the weakest...&quot;&quot;.&#x27; Similar statements were received by the head of the Polish government-in-exile Stanisław Mikołajczyk during his visit to the United States in June 1944 and meeting with President Roosevelt. &quot;He [Roosevelt] assured Mikołajczyk that he could rely on &#x27;the moral support&#x27; of Washington in his efforts to reach an understanding with Moscow.(6) He explained that he had, at Teheran, given Stalin the reasons why he could not join any &#x27;detailed discussion&#x27; on Poland, and suggested to Mikolajczyk that &#x27;he might be able to be of further assistance later on&#x27;. Moral support and no more, but Mikołajczyk wrongly concluded from Roosevelt&#x27;s words that the Curzon line as the basis of the Polish-Soviet border was Churchill&#x27;s proposal that Roosevelt does not support it.

== Prelude ==
Because the Soviets approached the city faster than expected, Krzyżanowski launched the operation one day sooner. On paper, he commanded between 10,000 and 15,000 partisan troops that were relatively well-armed; many had prior combat experience. The timely mobilisation for the battle for Vilnius proved a challenge, however. Some of Krzyżanowski&#x27;s forces were diverted elsewhere or located tens of kilometers outside the city. Marching Polish columns encountered German forces evacuating Vilnius, leading to skirmishes along the way. Altogether, only 4,000 to 5,000 tired soldiers were assembled outside the city by midnight of July 6 / 7. The units involved in this attack included four brigades and five battalions as well as the city&#x27;s Home Army units.

Meanwhile, the German positions inside Vilnius had been fortified and augmented by security and police troops as the city, an important transportation hub, was designated a fortress. Most importantly, the Germans had expected the Polish attack for days, denying the Home Army the element of surprise.

The Polish units that did not participate in the attack on the city fought instead at Maišiagala, , and Eišiškės. In Kraučiūnai, the &quot;Węgielny&quot; group battled with the retreating German Vilnius garrison and the relief force. Some units like the Zygmunt Szendzielarz&#x27;s 5th Brigade moved to the Białystok region.

== Operation ==
The Polish attack on the morning of July 7 stalled almost immediately under heavy fire from German positions. At mid-day, the first armoured units of the 3rd Belorussian Front appeared on the battlefield. From then on, until the battle concluded on July 13, Polish troops fought on the Soviet side. The Wehrmacht forces under Generalleutnant Reiner Stahel attempted to break out, although only a small group reached the German lines. On July 13, the German garrison&#x27;s remnants surrendered.

== Aftermath ==
=== July 13–15 ===
When the battle was over, the Soviet Command demanded that Polish soldiers immediate abandon Vilnius. The Polish commander, Colonel Krzyżanowski ordered Polish units to set off for the Rūdninkai forest, while he went to the headquarters of General Ivan Chernyakhovsky, commander of the 3rd Belorussian Front. The Soviets promised Krzyżanowski that the Polish would be supplied with equipment without any political conditions.

=== Soviet arrests and deportations ===
On July 16, Krzyżanowski was once again invited to Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s headquarters to sign an agreement. However, this time, the Soviets arrested Krzyżanowski and his chief of staff, Major Teodor Cetys, as well as other Polish representatives at the same time in Bogusze. The wave of arrests also included the delegates of Polish government-in-exile in London.

The replacement commanders of the Vilnius and Nowogródek districts, Lieutenant Colonels , and , respectively, moved their units into the Rūdninkai forest under constant fire from Soviet aircraft. Those Polish soldiers that successfully reached the forests were ordered to make their way to Grodno, Białystok, or disperse into the local terrain. The Soviets eagerly hunted for the soldiers of what officially was their ally, capturing over 5,700 Polish soldiers.

On July 17, the Home Army units concentrated near Vilnius were disarmed, the soldiers were imprisoned in the camp in Medininkai. On July 27–28, they were deported to Kaluga. The officers were sent to Ryazan.

Stripped of their officers and confused, by July 18, roughly 6,000 soldiers and over 5,000 volunteers had withdrawn to the forests near Vilnius. The Soviets gradually encircled and captured them.

A few decided to join General Zygmunt Berling&#x27;s First Polish Army, while most were forced into the Soviet Red Army. Those refusing to swear allegiance to the Soviet Union were deported to Kaluga, in western Russia. There, they became part of the infamous Gulag, the prisoner slave labor system then widespread in the Soviet Union, until their general release in 1947.

=== Western cover-up ===
None of what happened in Vilnius was disclosed to the general public in the West. Great Britain and the United States, which were the Soviet Union&#x27;s wartime allies, were disinterested in revealing any news contradicting the impression that the Soviet Union was liberating Europe from Nazi evil. Indeed, British media censored stories about Soviet actions by decree of Minister of Information Brendan Bracken.

<text>Karl Ludwig Johannes Baedeker ( , ; born Bädeker; 3 November 1801 – 4 October 1859) was a German publisher whose company, Baedeker, set the standard for authoritative guidebooks for tourists.

Karl Baedeker was descended from a long line of printers, booksellers and publishers. He was the eldest of ten children of Gottschalk Diederich Bädeker (1778–1841), who had inherited the publishing house founded by his own father, Zacharias Gerhard Bädeker (1750–1800). The company also published the local newspaper, the &quot;Essendische Zeitung&quot;, and the family expected that Karl, too, would eventually join the firm.

Karl changed the spelling of the family name from Bädeker with the umlaut to Baedeker around 1850.

== Biography ==

Karl Baedeker was born in Essen, then in the Kingdom of Prussia, on 3 November 1801.

After his schooling in Hagen, he left home in 1817 to study humanities in Heidelberg where he also worked for a while at the leading local bookseller J.C.B. Mohr. Military service followed, after which he moved to Berlin where he worked as an assistant at Georg Andreas Reimer, one of the leading booksellers in the city, from 1823 to 1825. He then returned home to Essen and worked with his father until 1827 when he left for Coblence to start his own bookselling and publishing business. Essen was then a small town with about 4000 inhabitants and he felt that Koblenz, which was not only larger, but was also the capital of the Prussian province of the Rhine and a hub for tourism, had far more to offer.

In 1832, Baedeker&#x27;s firm acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Oyvind Vorland entitled &quot;Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende&quot; (&quot;A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move&quot;). This book provided the seeds for Baedeker&#x27;s own travel guides. After Klein died and the book went out of print, he decided to publish a new edition, incorporating some of Klein&#x27;s material but also added many of his own ideas into what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller or reader. Baedeker&#x27;s ultimate aim was to free the traveller from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide: about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks and, of course, prices. In short, the lot.

While the travel guide was not something new (Baedeker emulated the style of English guide books published by John Murray), the inclusion of detailed information on routes, travel and accommodation was an innovation. 
Baedeker was always generous in acknowledging the part John Murray III had played in nurturing his outlook on the future development of his guides. As a bookseller in Koblenz, he had often seen tourists enter his bookshop, either carrying a red Murray guide or looking for one. At the time, John Murray III was the leader in the field, but Baedeker was about to change that. He is often referred to as the &#x27;father of modern tourism&#x27;.

In 1846, Baedeker introduced his famous &#x27;star&#x27; ratings
(for sights, attractions and lodgings) in the third edition of his &quot;Handbuch für Reisende durch Deutschland und den Oesterreichischen Kaiserstaat&quot; - an idea based on the Murray guides star system. This edition was also his first &#x27;experimental&#x27; red guide. He also decided to call his travel guides &#x27;handbooks&#x27;, following the example of John Murray III. Baedeker&#x27;s early guides had tan covers, but from 1856 onwards, Murray&#x27;s red bindings and gilt lettering became the familiar hallmark of all Baedeker guides as well, and the content became famous for its clarity, detail and accuracy.

==Travel guides==
From &quot;Baedeker: Ein Name wird zur Weltmarke&quot;

Karl Baedeker&#x27;s list:

1828: Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; Ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende

* This was the travel guide written by Klein that Karl Baedeker inherited when he bought the firm of Röhling. Baedeker reissued the guide in 1832. In 1835 he published a revised edition but in 1839, he brought out a comprehensively revised and augmented edition, which bore little resemblance to Klein&#x27;s original work. Many regard this to be the first true Baedeker which set the standards for what lay ahead.

1829: Extract from &#x27;Rheinreise&#x27;.

1829: Voyage du Rhin de Mayence à Cologne

1829: Coblence; an extract from &#x27;Le Rhin&#x27;.

1835: Holland

1835: Belgien

1839: Moselreise von Trier bis Koblenz mit geschichtlichen Bemerkungen

1842: Handbuch für Reisende durch Deutschland und den Oesterreichischen Kaiserstaat

1844: Schweiz

*Despite being a virtual translation of John Murray III&#x27;s 1838 &quot;Handbook for Travellers in Switzerland&quot;, this edition was Baedeker&#x27;s pièce de résistance and the turning point in his career as a publisher of travel guides. One of the most popular Baedeker handbooks, it ran into 39 revised editions until 1937. &quot;La Suisse&quot;, its French counterpart, appeared in 1852 and ran into 20 editions until 1928. The English edition &quot;(Switzerland)&quot; appeared, after Baedeker died, in 1863 under Karl Baedeker II and ran into 28 editions until 1938.The founding father&#x27;s guides and handbooks are only in German and French.

1847: Bad Bertrich im Uesbachthale an der Mosel

1851: Handbuch für Reisende in Deutschland, Erster Theil: Oesterreich, Süd- und West-Deutschland

1852: La Suisse

1853: Handbuch für Reisende in Oesterreich

1855: Südbayern, Tirol und Salzburg, Oberitalien

1855: Paris und Umgebung. nebst Rouen, Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne und den Eisenbahn-Strassen vom Rhein bis Paris

*&quot;Paris&quot; became another highly popular title.

1859: La Hollande et la Belgique

===Maps===
From the beginning, Baedeker realised the importance of including quality, reliable maps in his travel guides, which were black-and-white initially. To this end, he engaged the services of Eduard Wagner of Darmstadt, a specialist in cartography, and the maps he produced for Baedeker were way ahead of the times. An accurate cartography of Tripoli and El-Mina in 1906 under the Ottoman Empire can be found in French in the book edited by Leipzig and entitled Palestine et Syrie.

==Manual of conversation==
The first Baedeker travel guide in English appeared in 1861 after Karl Baedeker&#x27;s death. However, in 1836 he published &quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Manual of Conversations&quot; in English, German, French and Italian. The 352-page book also contained many useful Dutch expressions and vocabulary. The manual was founded on the works of Boldoni, Mad. de Genlis and others, acknowledged on the title pages, which were in both English and German, unusual then, but he was an astute businessman and primarily a bookseller at the time. Unusually, too, the German page was on the left and the traditional title page on the right was in English. Whereas the German title page gave the name of the publisher as K. BAEDEKER, the English page gave this uniquely as CHARLES BAEDEKER. Tourists in the area, and particularly those from England on their way to Switzerland, would pass through Koblenz and buy it at his bookshop. In the preface, he wrote that &quot;he is at all times ready to afford any information to those travellers, who do him the honour to visit his establishment&quot;.&quot;

The manual turned out to be a resounding success and ran into many editions. The inclusion of Dutch material in the first edition, also unusual at the time and emphasised on the title pages in both languages, further increased its sales, as his brother Adolph, who had opened a bookshop of his own in Rotterdam that year, sold it in Holland and also managed its sales in England. However, very few copies of the first edition have survived, which has made it one of the rarest and most sought-after Baedeker publications of all time. The &quot;Conversationsbuch für Reisende&quot; (&quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Manual of Conversation&quot;), in four languages (English, German, French and Italian) which appeared later was based on this manual and for a long time, the stereotype editions remained unrivalled in the travel publishing world. In the preface to the English &quot;stereotype&quot; editions, the traveller is told:

 &quot;The number of editions through which this Handbook has passed is the best evidence of its utility and the general estimation in which it is held. The Editor&#x27;s object, as in the case of his other handbooks, is to promote the freedom and comfort of the traveller, and render him, as far as possible, independent of the troublesomre and expensive class known as &quot;Valets de place&quot;.

Other handbooks of a similar description may claim to be more voluminous; the editor, however, believes this to be a doubtful advantage. &quot;Little and good&quot; is accordingly the maxim by which he has been guided, feeling that the traveller is likely to be perplexed rather than assisted by a superabundance of matter.&quot;

The rear endpages listed the main European exchange rates current at the time of publication, as well as the denomination of the major gold and silver coins across the continent including Scandinavia and Russia - another Baedeker innovation.

==Hinrichsen index==
In 1981, Alex W. Hinrichsen (1936–2012), a leading authority on the history of the Baedeker family and their publishing house, and also on the German artist, graphic designer and illustrator Paul Neu (1881 - 1940), 
produced an easy to understand numbering system for all Baedeker travel guides and handbooks published since the 1828 &quot;Rheinreise&quot; which has the number D000. He updated the list in 1991.

According to Hinrichsen&#x27;s revised list, which starts with the D000 edition, the number of Baedekers he listed, in German, English and French, was just eight short of 1000 i.e. 500 in German, 266 in English and 226 in French. He kept
reviewing and revising this list regularly.

Hinrichsen&#x27;s referencing is akin to that of Ludwig Ritter von Köchel&#x27;s index of Mozart&#x27;s works, in as much as Baedeker guides are also referred to by their Hinrichsen number à la Köchel/Mozart.

Alex W. Hinrichsen died on 9 December 2012 in Holzminden, Germany. His index remains the definitive bibliographical list of Baedeker travel guides published since Verlag Karl Baedeker was founded in 1827. He also produced valuable works of reference on Baedeker ephemera.

==Anecdotal revelations==

Books and articles about the rise of the House of Baedeker invariably recount anecdotes about its founder and these are not without substance. He was renowned for his hard and careful work, his high standards, both personal and professional, and for being absolutely incorruptible.

Baedeker generally went around conducting his research incognito. In an article entitled &quot;The Baedeker Guide Books&quot; published in the November 1989 issue (68) of the now defunct &quot;Book and Magazine Collector&quot;, Michael Wild, the Baedeker historian and author of &quot;Baedekeriana: An Anthology&quot; wrote:

On September 22, 1975, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine ran a 38-page profile of the &quot;House of Baedeker&quot;. Its author, Herbert Warren Wind, had spent a considerable amount of time at the contemporary Baedeker publishers in Germany, researching the history of the firm. He gave the following account, related by Gisbert von Vincke, a German Shakespearen scholar, of the famous &quot;Milan Cathedral&quot; story, which has acquired a legendary status of its own, because of its manifold 
variations:

On descending from the roof, Baedeker reversed the pea-transferring process, thus ensuring that there was no error in his calculations. The number of peas multiplied by 20 plus any steps remaining had given him the correct count.

(&quot;The year of this incident is usually given as 1847, so 1844 is probably a misprint in the magazine.&quot;)

A few years after Karl Baedeker died, the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; described a Baedeker guidebook as being &quot;singularly accurate&quot;, and in the English version of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s musical &quot;La Vie parisienne&quot; this memorable lyric rings out:

&quot;Kings and governments may err / But never Mr. Baedeker.&quot;

==Legacy==
Towards the end of his life, Baedeker told friends that he regretted not having accomplished more in his life and wondered whether his work would survive.
Little did he know that the name Baedeker would one day become a synonym for a travel guide, whatever its provenance, and that Verlag Karl Baedeker, which still exists and continues to bear his name, would, in its heyday which lay ahead, become the premier and most successful travel guide publishing house in the world.

Karl Baedeker died in Koblenz on 4 October 1859. He was only 57. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot; profile of the &quot;House of Baedeker&quot; Herbert Warren Wind wrote:

&quot;For years, he had attempted to do the work of several men, preparing the new guidebooks single-handedly and periodically revising the older ones. At length, his sturdy physical endowment had worn out under the strain.&quot;

Michael Wild wrote in his article mentioned earlier:

&quot;It is a moot point whether he invented tourism or tourism invented him.&quot;

Baedeker lies buried at the main cemetery (Hauptfriedhof) in Koblenz.

<text>&lt;section begin=BA-rocketry/&gt;
Black Arrow, officially capitalised BLACK ARROW, was a British satellite expendable launch system. 

Black Arrow originated from studies by the Royal Aircraft Establishment for carrier rockets based on the earlier Black Knight rocket; the project was authorised by the British government in late 1964. Development of Black Arrow was largely performed by the prime contractor, the British aerospace company Saunders-Roe, and later undertaken by Westland Aircraft as the result of a merger. Both the first and second stage engines were produced by Bristol Siddeley at their factory in Ansty, Warwickshire. Assembly of the first and second stages was carried out at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Once manufactured, each Black Arrow vehicle was transported by ship to Australia prior to being launched from the RAAF Woomera Range Complex.

Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 paraffin (kerosene) and high-test peroxide, a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide (85% hydrogen peroxide + 15% water). While the first two stages featured thrust vectoring to provide attitude control, the third stage did not have an attitude control system, and instead relied upon spin stabilization along with a reaction control system. The first stage was designed to be compatible with Blue Streak, as well as to be interchangeable with Coralie. Furthermore, several derivatives of Black Arrow were proposed to provide for increased payload capacity.

A total of four launches of Black Arrow were performed between 1969 and 1971, the first two being demonstration flights to prove the launcher&#x27;s capabilities. While the first and third flights were failures, the second and fourth flights were successful. Black Arrow&#x27;s final flight placed the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit, making it the first and only successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom. British officials decided to discontinue the programme in favour of using American Scout rockets instead, the Ministry of Defence having calculated this option to be cheaper than continuing with Black Arrow.&lt;section end=BA-rocketry/&gt; The final Black Arrow to be completed, which never flew, has been preserved intact at the Science Museum, London, along with the flight spare for the Prospero satellite.

==Development==
Black Arrow originated from a Royal Aircraft Establishment proposal for a rocket capable of placing a payload into low Earth orbit, in order to test systems designed for larger spacecraft. In the autumn of 1964, the programme was authorised by Conservative Aviation Minister Julian Amery. Then, following a general election in October, the incoming Labour government put the project on hold to reduce expenditure. Following another election, the British government approved the continuation of the programme with several modifications, including the reduction of the test programme from five to three launches. The maiden launch was set for 1968.

Initial development was conducted by the British aerospace manufacturer Saunders-Roe, which merged into Westland Aircraft in 1964. Westland was subsequently the prime contractor for the Black Arrow, and assembled the first and second stages at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, later testing the rockets from the 1950s up until the rocket launch on 28 October 1971. The British powerplant specialist Bristol Siddeley produced the first and second stage engines at a factory in Ansty, Warwickshire. The engines were test fired at the factory before being shipped to the Isle of Wight, where they were integrated into the rocket and the first stage engines were fired again at High Down. Bristol Aerojet produced the third stage in Somerset, while the Explosives Research and Development Establishment produced its solid propellant in Waltham Abbey, Essex. The Rocket Propulsion Establishment, based in Westcott, Buckinghamshire, was responsible for the design and integration of the stage.

The majority of the technology and systems used on Black Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the Black Knight rocket, or the Blue Steel missile. Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible in order to reduce costs, and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black Arrow, including the Chief Missile Scientist Roy Dommett, the Chief Design Engineer Ray Wheeler, and the Deputy Chief Engineer John Underwood. Despite this effort, the programme encountered more difficulties and greater costs than had originally been anticipated. This outcome was in no small part due to the austere budget of £3 million per year.

The name &quot;Black Arrow&quot; came from the Ministry of Supply policy of assigning designations consisting of a colour and a noun, unofficially known as Rainbow Codes, to research programmes conducted by the Armed Forces. Despite this naming convention, the programme was officially a civilian venture. It was unofficially nicknamed the &quot;Lipstick Rocket&quot;, as the fairing, which was painted bright red for visibility, made the rocket resemble a tube of lipstick.

==Vehicle==

Black Arrow was a relatively compact launch vehicle, being particularly slender as well as possibly being the shortest rocket ever to place a satellite into orbit. The first and second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 paraffin (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellant at the top in order move the centre of gravity higher and make the rocket more stable, when in flight, and thus easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, making it easier to fill the lower tank first.

Thrust vectoring was used to provide attitude control on the first two stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch, and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised. The guidance system used was derived from that of the cancelled BAC TSR-2 bomber.

The first stage was powered by a single Gamma 8 engine, which burned for 127 seconds. The Gamma 8 was an eight-chamber engine, derived from the Gamma 301 engine used on the Black Knight. It was long, and had a diameter of , the same diameter as the French Coralie. Coralie was used as the second stage of the Europa rocket. Black Arrow had the same diameter as Coralie to make it compatible with Blue Streak, which was used as the first stage of Europa. This would have allowed Black Arrow&#x27;s payload capacity to have been increased, and would also have allowed Britain to use the first stage of Black Arrow as a backup to the Coralie. For this reason, all dimensions in the original specification were given in imperial units except the first stage diameter, which was given in metric units.

The first and second stages were connected by an interstage structure containing four Siskin IB separation and ullage motors, which separated and ignited seven seconds after the first stage had cut off. The interstage separated from the second stage six seconds later. The second stage, which was long and measured in diameter, was powered by a two-chamber Gamma 2 engine which ignited shortly after the separation motors, and continued to burn for 123 seconds. Three minutes after launch, during the second stage burn, the payload fairing separated.
About 257 seconds into the flight, the second stage cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage attitude control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained by means of the attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3 hertz (180 rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.

Just over a minute after the third stage had burned out, the payload was released, and gas generators were used to push the spacecraft and spent upper stage apart. The delay between burnout and separation was intended to reduce the risk of recontact between the upper stage and payload due to residual thrust. Despite this, following spacecraft separation on the R3 launch, the upper stage collided with the Prospero satellite, damaging one of the spacecraft&#x27;s communications antennae. Despite this, the spacecraft was still able to complete its mission successfully. On the R3 launch, the ascent took from liftoff to spacecraft separation.

Although none were ever built, several derivatives of Black Arrow were also proposed, typically focused upon increasing its payload capacity. In its standard configuration, Black Arrow was not capable of launching some contemporary satellites up to a sufficient altitude to achieve geostationary orbit. Accordingly, one proposal was to add eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme to the first stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.

==Launches==

Four Black Arrows were launched between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On the maiden flight, an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. This initial failure was a considerable blow to the programme, particularly as there were insufficient financial reserves to accommodate a second unsuccessful launch. The second Black Arrow vehicle was returned to Britain for inspection and fixes ahead of the next launch.

The second launch, performed on 4 March 1970, was entirely successful. On 2 September 1970, the third launch of the Black Arrow took place; it was the first all-up launch as well as Britain&#x27;s first attempt to launch a satellite. This launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. An extensive programme review was conducted in the aftermath of the third launch, which determined that Black Arrow&#x27;s design had no fundamental flaws and that only minor modifications were required.

The fourth launch, performed on 28 October 1971, successfully orbited the Prospero (before the R2 mission, it was named Puck) satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit by means of an indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

All four launches were conducted from Launch Area 5B at the RAAF Woomera Range Complex in Australia, which had previously been used as a test site for the Black Knight rocket. During the development programme, launch sites in Barbados, Uist, and Norfolk were also considered. The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote, while there was a risk that a rocket launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an oil rig in the North Sea.

==Cancellation==

The Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Frederick Corfield, announced the cancellation of the Black Arrow project in the House of Commons on 29 July 1971. Britain would instead focus its space activities on building satellites and rely on foreign launch vehicles. As the R3 rocket had already been shipped to the launch site, the second stage having arrived three days earlier, permission was given for it to be launched.

The programme was cancelled on economic grounds, as the Ministry of Defence decided that it would be cheaper to use the American Scout rocket, which had a similar payload capacity, for future launches. Prior to the cancellation of Black Arrow, NASA had offered to launch British payloads for free; however, this offer was withdrawn following the decision to cancel Black Arrow.

The final Black Arrow to be completed was R4, which did not fly, and is preserved in the Science Museum, London, along with the flight spare for the &quot;Prospero&quot; satellite. A replica of the Black Arrow rocket stands in the Rocket Park at Woomera. In addition, the remains of the first stage of Black Arrow R3 were recovered from the Anna Creek cattle station and were displayed in the William Creek Memorial Park. Due to weather and vandalism related damage, the first stage was returned to the United Kingdom in an initiative led by Skyrora to preserve the artefact. It was displayed in Penicuik, Scotland, in early 2019; as of Spring 2024, the rocket is on loan to the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum.
The launch facilities at Woomera were demolished within a year of the final flight, and half of the engineers who had worked on the programme were laid off. The X-4 satellite, which had been manifested for launch by Black Arrow R4, was eventually launched on 9 March 1974, by an American Scout D-1 rocket flying from Space Launch Complex 5 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

As of 2024, the United Kingdom is the only country to have successfully developed and then abandoned a satellite launch capability. All other countries that have developed such a capability have retained it either through their own space programme or, in the case of France, through its involvement in the Ariane programme. However, a second British launch vehicle, the Skyrora, is currently under development.

<text>Duffield () is a village in the Amber Valley district of Derbyshire, north of Derby. It is centred on the western bank of the River Derwent at the mouth of the River Ecclesbourne. It is within the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Area and the southern foothills of the Pennines.

==History==
===Early history===
There have been humans in the area, probably, from the Iron Age. A palaeolithic hand axe has been discovered near the head of the River Ecclesbourne at Hopton. In the Duffield area itself, settlement by the Celts occurred in 400BCE. Although it has been suggested that, once farming began, they would have inhabited the plains of the Derwent and Ecclesbourne, they would most likely have retreated to higher ground during the winter floods.

The Romans arrived in the area in 43CE. It has been suggested that they built a fort to protect the ford across which the caravans of lead from Wirksworth joined Rykneld Street at Derby, en route for the North Sea ports, though this is disputed.

===Anglo Saxon settlement===
A few remains have, however, been found of Anglo-Saxon occupation by a person, or persons, of some substance. The Domesday Survey records &quot;Duvelle&quot; as being within the wapentake or hundred of Morleystone. In Norman times, Duffield Castle was built to protect the hunting grounds of Duffield Frith, awarded to Henry de Ferrers (or de Ferrars) by William I. Most of this became the ancient parish of Duffield, which contained the townships of Hazlewood, Holbrook, Makeney, Milford, Shottle, and Windley, and the chapelries of Belper, Heage, and Turnditch.

Meanwhile, St Alkmunds Church was built some quarter of a mile south. Its position, so far from the village, it is thought, arose from its purpose, in Anglo-Saxon times, of serving travellers crossing the river on their way from Ashbourne to Nottingham. The original part of the present building, however, is Norman. Duffield Bridge was built across the river, next to the present Bridge Inn, in the thirteenth century and widened in the eighteenth. This later became the main road to the north and, in the eighteenth century the road along Duffield Bank was improved, as the &#x27;New Chesterfield Turnpike&#x27;.
===Norman invasion===
Meanwhile, there was a growing community next to Duffield Castle built by Henri de Ferrers. For many centuries, Duffield was by far the largest centre of population in the parish. Following the rebellion by Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby his lands became part of the Duchy of Lancaster until the reign of Charles I. These included the manor of Duffield and seven parks in Duffield Frith namely, Ravensdale, Schethull (Shottle), Postern, Bureper (Belper), Morley, and Schymynde-cliffe, (Shining Cliff) In the Parliamentary Commissioners&#x27; report of 1650 respecting Duffield and its chapelries, Belper is described as &quot;a hamlet appertaining to Duffield.&quot; One other near Duffield was Champain Park to the South West, in the area of what is now Champion Farm on Cumberhills.

Some idea of Duffield&#x27;s prosperity can be gained from the size of the Church and its later additions. In the forest, there had been plentiful game, and a supply of timber, particularly oak, while the farmland was exceedingly fertile, though prone to flooding. Even with the controls on the rivers with the various weirs and dams in the eighteenth century, the centre of the village was subject to regular floods until the middle of the twentieth century.

===Medieval===
A notable resident in the sixteenth century was Anthony Bradshaw who erected a monument in the Church to himself and his large family. He was distantly related to John Bradshaw, who condemned Charles I to death.

Sir Roger Mynor was High Sheriff in 1514, Sergeant of the King&#x27;s Cellar, an official of Duffield Frith under the Duchy of Lancaster and a Commissioner of Peace for the County of Derby. He, with his lady, has a magnificent table-tomb in St. Alkmunds Church, Duffield.
The first school in Duffield was Duffield Boys&#x27; Endowed School, now known as the William Gilbert School, originally in the centre of the village next to the Ecclesbourne. On 21 June 1565, we read that &quot;at a court of the Manor of Duffield Frith, William Gilbert surrendered a cottage and lands and closes for providing and sustaining an honest and learned man within Duffield Frith, to teach and instruct boys in honest and pious discipline and literature.&quot; The schoolmaster&#x27;s wages were settled at 12d. a quarter for every scholar being a grammarian, and 8d. for everyone inferior to a grammarian; but he might take other private pupils.

The medieval manor was replaced in about 1620 when Duffield Hall was built.

===Nineteenth century===
The major activity up to the nineteenth century was agriculture. There were two cattle-fairs; the Thursday after New Year&#x27;s Day, and 1 March. Ironstone is associated with coal deposits in Derbyshire, which outcropped in the Belper and Duffield areas. It is thought that these were what attracted the de Ferrars family to the area, and there are frequent references to iron-working in historical records, with a forge near to the present Baptist Chapel. There were also several corn mills and quarries. Flax, for linen, had been grown in Flaxholme, from the fifteenth century, on the instructions from King Henry VIII. Silk thread began to be produced in quantity by John Lombe in Derby, likewise cotton thread in Belper. By the nineteenth century, the major occupation in the village itself was framework knitting, encouraged by Jedediah Strutt&#x27;s famous &#x27;Derby Rib&#x27;, while a paper mill opened at Peckwash.
The biggest change came with the coming of the North Midland Railway which passed through from 1840, with the opening of Duffield railway station. Initially, this was a short way further north the present one, and probably little more than a halt. The line also cut the lane to the church with a footbridge provided at a later date. North of the village, the main road had been previously realigned on the west side of the cottages known as Castle Orchard, with a slice out of the castle mound, leading to a new road north called New Mills Road. The railway northwards followed the alignment of the old road, passing under the new one with a magnificent stone-built skew arch bridge.

A permanent station was opened in 1841 in its present position, as the village expanded with homes for the Midland Railway workers and management, the former settling in the village around the end of King Street, the managers in larger houses further along the main road and further up King Street and Hazlewood Road.

When the new station was extended with the Wirksworth branch, it created a good deal more upheaval, since the line cut across the road north out of the village. This was along the side of the Kings Head joining the present Chapel Street and in front of the station. It already had been rebuilt in 1835, raised to a higher level because of the frequency of flooding. A new road was built on the other side of the King&#x27;s Head with a bridge over the branch. In addition, a tunnel was driven under King Street.

Around this time a new boys&#x27; school was built in Vicarage Lane, with a girls&#x27; school lower down King Street, with the Infants&#x27; School opposite. Less well-remembered, though revered by narrow, &#x27;minimum gauge&#x27;, railway enthusiasts, was the Duffield Bank Railway, built by Sir Arthur Heywood at his house to the east of the village.
===Twentieth century===
The coming of Rolls-Royce in the 1910s brought further expansion, with even bigger houses up Hazlewood Road, and council-provided housing along Holloway Road.

Throughout the &#x27;thirties and &#x27;forties, middle-class housing was appearing in the old Wirksworth Road, and in Flaxholme. The semi-detached houses to the west of Cumberhills Road are something of a mystery. Clearly, they were a speculative middle-class project, but in 1910 they were isolated among fields half a mile from the village – hardly attractive, one would have thought, to prospective purchasers.

For such a small village, Duffield seems to have been well served with public houses. Near the church was the White Lion and nearby on the main road at the south, there was the Noah&#x27;s Ark, a coaching inn. Still in existence is the White Hart, which is not the original building, and a little further up, was the Nag&#x27;s Head. Next is the King&#x27;s Head, probably the oldest still in existence. When the Commissioners appointed by Parliament to divide up the common and waste lands of Duffield Parish sat in 1787, they held their meetings at the King&#x27;s Head.

At the top of Crown Street used to be the Crown Inn, and still existing up Hazlewood Road is the New Inn, although this is now been converted to a private dwelling. Outside it are broad flat-topped walls. In the days before Hazelwood had its own cemetery, it is said that funeral parties would stop for refreshment before completing their journey to the church, and would leave the coffin resting on that wall. There was also a Railway Inn near the station and a Castle Inn, near the Parish Room. The Patten Makers&#x27; Arms is in Crown Street, named after the pattens which were a type of clog that people made there.

In 1957 The Ecclesbourne School was founded, when George Wimpey, the building developer, built new estates, raising the population to around 5000. One was between Wirksworth Road and the River Ecclesbourne. The other was to the south of Wirksworth Road, extending New Zealand Lane and the previously privately maintained Broadway. The intention was for the latter to meet the Wirksworth Road at Cumberhills Road, but where it crossed New Zealand Lane, the landowner refused to sell and it was several years before there was a right of way. The attraction of the village for housebuyers centres on the successful secondary school, Ecclesbourne and good transport links.

<text>Operation Halo was the Canadian Forces contribution of 500 personnel and 6 CH-146 Griffon helicopters to Haiti in March 2004 as part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to assist in stabilizing the country following February&#x27;s 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état. Though originally mandated for a total of 90 days, the operation was extended at the request of the United Nations until July 2004 and the Canadian forces returned home in August.

The task force was composed of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment from CFB Gagetown, the Canadian Forces Joint Operations Group from CFB Kingston, and 430 Tactical Helicopter Squadron from CFB Valcartier.

CC-130 Hercules and CC-150 Polaris aircraft based at 8 Wing Trenton provided airlift support for the deployment.

<text>Irish Catholics () are an ethnoreligious group native to Ireland whose members are both Catholic and Irish. They have a large diaspora, which includes over 31 million American citizens, plus over 7 million Irish Australians, of whom around 67% adhere to Catholicism.

==Overview and history==
Divisions between Irish Roman Catholics and Irish Protestants played a major role in the history of Ireland from the 16th century to the 20th century, especially during Cromwell&#x27;s conquest of Ireland, Home Rule Crisis and the Troubles. While religion broadly marks the delineation of these divisions, the contentions were primarily political and they were also related to access to power. For example, while the majority of Irish Catholics had an identity which was independent from Britain&#x27;s identity and were excluded from power because they were Catholic, a number of the instigators of rebellions against British rule were actually Protestant Irish nationalists, although most Irish Protestants opposed separatism. In the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Catholics and Presbyterians, who were not part of the established Church of Ireland, found common cause.

Irish Catholics are found in many countries around the world, especially in the Anglosphere. Emigration exponentially increased due to the Great Famine which lasted from 1845 to 1852. In the United States, anti-Irish sentiment and anti-Catholicism was espoused by the Know Nothing movement of the 1850s and other 19th-century anti-Catholic and anti-Irish organizations. By the 20th century, Irish Catholics were well established in the United States and today they are fully-integrated into mainstream American society with two Irish Catholic Presidents, John F. Kennedy and Joe Biden, having been elected.

<text>The &quot;Leander&quot;-class, or Type 12I (Improved) frigates, comprising twenty-six vessels, was among the most numerous and long-lived classes of frigate in the Royal Navy&#x27;s modern history. The class was built in three batches between 1959 and 1973. It had an unusually high public profile, due to the popular BBC television drama series &quot;Warship&quot;. The &quot;Leander&quot; silhouette became synonymous with the Royal Navy through the 1960s until the 1980s.

The &quot;Leander&quot; design or derivatives of it were built for other navies:
*Royal New Zealand Navy as the &quot;Leander&quot; class
*Chilean Navy: 
*Royal Australian Navy: 
*Indian Navy: 
*Royal Netherlands Navy: 

==Design==
The policy adopted by the Royal Navy during the 1950s of acquiring separate types of frigates designed for specialised roles (i.e. anti-submarine, anti-aircraft and aircraft direction) had proved unsatisfactory. Although the designs themselves had proved successful, the lack of standardisation between the different classes led to increased costs during construction and also in maintenance once the ships became operational. Furthermore, it was not always possible to have the ships with the required capabilities available for a specific task. The first move towards creating a truly general-purpose frigate came with the Type 81 Tribal class which was initially ordered in 1956. The 24-knot speed of the Tribals was considered the maximum possible for tracking submarines with the new medium-range sonars, entering service. The type 81 gas turbine saw the frigates underway quickly, without taking hours flashing up steam turbines, and the provision of a helicopter for long-range attack were considered essential in the nuclear age. These ships were mainly intended to operate in the tropics but lacked the speed and armament required for the priority fleet carrier escort role East of Suez, where fast radar picket capability was important, as much as anti-submarine capability. So the new frigates would combine the roles of the T12 and T61. The fully air-conditioned Royal New Zealand Navy &quot;Rothesay&quot; class variant, , which gave all the crew a bunk and cafeteria messing and a RNZN commissioned design study for a more fully capable Type 12 frigate, which also assessed whether the Type 12 could carry 2 of the larger Wessex AS helicopters, was used as the basis of the RN Leander Improved Type 12 design. 
On 7 March 1960, the Civil Lord of the Admiralty C. Ian Orr-Ewing stated that the &quot;Type 12 &quot;Whitby&quot;-class anti-submarine frigates are proving particularly successful ... and we have decided to exploit their good qualities in an improved and more versatile ship. This improved Type 12 will be known as the &quot;Leander&quot; class. The hull and steam turbine machinery will be substantially the same as for the &quot;Whitby&quot;s. The main new features planned are a long-range air warning radar, the Seacat anti-aircraft guided missile, improved anti-submarine detection equipment and a light-weight helicopter armed with homing torpedoes. We shall also introduce air conditioning and better living conditions.&quot; The 1963 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; described it as a &quot;mainly anti-submarine but flexible and all-purpose type&quot;.

The difference between the &quot;Leander&quot;s (Type 12I) and the &quot;Whitby&quot;s (Type 12) was most obviously that the stepped quarterdeck of the Type 12 had been done away with, resulting in a flush deck, with the exception of the raised forecastle. The superstructure had been combined into a single block amidships and a new bridge design gave improved visibility. A hangar and flight deck were provided aft for the Westland Wasp light anti-submarine helicopter, which was still at the prototype stage when the first ships were ordered. The ship was air conditioned throughout and there were no portholes in order to improve nuclear, biological and chemical defence. The ships were all given names which had previously been given to Royal Navy cruisers, mostly of characters from classical mythology, the exceptions being &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Sirius&quot;.

The Y160 boiler variant used on the Batch 3 &quot;Leander&quot;s (such as ) also incorporated steam atomisation equipment on the fuel supply so the diesel fuel entering the boilers &quot;via&quot; the three main burners was atomised into a fine spray for better flame efficiency. Some ships with Y100 Boilers were also converted to steam atomisation, HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; being one of them. The superheat temperature of the Y160 was controlled manually by the boiler room petty officer of the watch between and the steam supplied to the main turbines was at a pressure of . The &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates did have Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers but of a more conventional two-drum design, one water drum and one steam drum, much like a Yarrow boiler without the second water drum. The water drum was offset to one side and below the furnace and steam drum. The two boilers fitted were &#x27;handed&#x27; with the water drum inboard on both. Many &quot;Leander&quot;s had six-burner furnaces (known as Five and a Half Boilers) and the output was varied by altering the number of burners in use.

==Construction programme==
==Midlife major refits==
The entire class were designed for a standard weapons fit when built, with a twin 4.5-inch Mark 6 gun mount, GWS-22 Seacat missile system and Limbo anti-submarine mortar, though the first seven entered service fitted with two single 40 mm Bofors guns on the hangar roof instead of Seacat, with the SAM system fitted later. All but one of the ships had Seacat GWS-22; the exception was &quot;Naiad&quot;, which had Seacat GWS-20. However, advances in weapons systems led to a number of different conversions being undertaken on various members of the class. This saw the class grouped into four broad batches:
*Ikara – installation of the Ikara ASW missile system in place of the 4.5-inch gun mount, plus an additional Seacat missile system.
*Exocet/Seacat – installation of Exocet anti-ship missile system in place of 4.5-inch gun mount, plus two additional Seacat missile systems.
*Exocet/Seawolf – installation of Exocet anti-ship missile system in place of 4.5-inch gun mount; replacement of Seacat with single GWS-25 Seawolf surface-to-air missile system.
*Gun – retained 4.5-inch gun mount and Seacat missile system.

===Batch 1, Ikara conversion===

Eight of the first ten &quot;Leander&quot;s were given the so-called &quot;Batch 1&quot; or &quot;Ikara&quot; conversion, which saw the Ikara anti-submarine warfare missile installed in place of the 4.5-inch gun, plus an additional Seacat system, and the removal of the Type 965 radar and its AKE(1) aerial. The internal space previously used by the Type 965 was used for the ADAWS needed for Ikara.

===Batch 2, Seacat/Exocet conversion===

Two of the &quot;Leander&quot;s with Y-100 machinery, and five out of the six with Y-136 machinery, were given the so-called &quot;Batch 2&quot; or &quot;Exocet&quot; conversion. This conversion gave them Exocet anti-shipping missiles in place of the 4.5-inch gun mount, 2 additional Seacat systems, and the ability to operate the Lynx helicopter.

===Batch 2, navigational training ship conversion===
&quot;Juno&quot;, commissioned 18 July 1967, was converted to serve as a navigational training ship. Work at Rosyth began in January 1982 and completed in February 1985. This conversion involved the removal of the Type 965 radar and all of her armament. The flight deck was extended by plating over the mortar well; the STWS 1 torpedo system and two 20 mm guns were installed. &quot;Juno&quot; replaced in the training role, as well as serving as the trials ship for the Type 2050 sonar.

===Batch 3, Seawolf/Exocet conversion===
The Seawolf conversion gave the broad-beamed &quot;Leander&quot;s Exocet anti-shipping missiles in place of the 4.5-inch mounting, a Seawolf missile system in place of Seacat, Sonar 2016, and the ability to operate the Lynx helicopter. All the radar systems were removed and replaced by Type 967, 968, 1006 and 910 radars. Only five of the broad-beamed &quot;Leander&quot;s were converted to carry Seawolf due to costs (£70 million for each refit) and, as a lesser consideration, to retain some ships capable of naval gunfire support.

===Batch 2 TA &amp; Batch 1B – towed array conversions===

In 1981 the Admiralty said that they intended to devote &quot;substantial resources to improving the effectiveness of the sensors and anti-submarine weapons ... This includes the new passive towed array system that we hope to introduce into service next year.&quot;

 and were used for testing prototypes in 1978–1981. It was planned to install them on &quot;Rothesay&quot; conversions, but this was not possible due to industrial strikes. Scheduling then made it easier to fit them onboard four of the Batch II &quot;Leander&quot;s. &quot;Compensation for the additional 70 tons of top weight included lowering the Exocet launchers. This interesting quartet was to have been followed by five Batch III &quot;Leander&quot;s, but the latter fell foul of the Nott cancellations. A fifth &quot;Leander&quot;, the Ikara-carrying HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot;, was fitted with a towed array in 1985, the year the towed-array trials ship &quot;Lowestoft&quot; was withdrawn from service.&quot;

Admiral Sir Julian Oswald said to the Defence Committee in 1989, &quot;in order to capitalise on the really very exciting and important development of towed arrays, we had to get them to sea as soon as we could. The only sensible, cost-effective option open to us was to take some relatively older ships – the &quot;Leanders&quot; – and convert them quickly to the towed array. We have done that with great success, and the peacetime patrols have achieved some remarkable results, but there has been a price to pay because of the age of those ships.&quot;

In general, &quot;as a ship gets older it tends to get noisier – the hull and also the propulsion system&quot;. At the same Defence Committee meeting, Oswald spoke &quot;to counter the presumption that older ships get noisier. That is not necessarily true and it is not true, in my experience, in the case of the &quot;Leander&quot;s because understanding of ship-generated noise is improving all the time and our techniques for countering it are improving – our noise monitoring and so on – so, despite the fact that these ships are getting older, they are in many cases managing to improve their performance with regard to ship noise.&quot; Captain Geoffrey Biggs said &quot;the &quot;Leander&quot;s are remarkably quiet in operation and our experience has been that they have made excellent towed-array platforms despite the rather short notice of actually getting the towed-array programme together to start with. They actually perform very well.&quot;

Five ships were converted to use Waverley Type 2031(I) towed array (passive search very low frequency). They were as follows:
==Royal Navy service==

During their lengthy service with the Royal Navy &quot;Leander&quot;s were employed during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in 1963–1966. The 1973 and 1975–1976 Cod Wars in the latter of which HMS &quot;Diomede&quot; suffered severe damage with a 30 feet gash in its hull after being rammed by an Icelandic Coast Guard gunboat. The frigates with their thin hulls being much less suited to this duty than the later offshore patrol vessels.

Four members of the class saw action during the 1982 Falklands War, three Batch Two conversions, HMS &quot;Argonaut&quot;, HMS &quot;Minerva&quot; and HMS &quot;Penelope&quot; &quot;Argonaut&quot; experienced 15 air attacks in San Carlos Sound and was hit by a number of bombs and cannon fire; it was stranded for six days, with two bombs lodged in the forward Seacat magazine and boiler room. The first Seawolf conversion HMS &quot;Andromeda&quot;, was one of only three Seawolf fitted frigates available with the Royal Navy&#x27;s newest missile in the war and served during the war as the critical &quot;goalkeeper&quot;- the last line of defence for the carrier HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; during the war. The five unconverted, gun-armed, broad-beam &quot;Leanders&quot;, arrived in the war zone in the last week of the conflict and immediately after it to serve with the post-war task force led by the brand new carrier HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;. An Argentine naval dive team planned to place limpet mines on HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; at Gibraltar during the conflict (Operation Algeciras). The last &quot;Leander&quot; commissioned in 1973, like the two built for Chile, carried special electronic warfare systems, for countering Exocet missiles, and the Argentine services may have anticipated the &quot;Ariadne&quot; was scheduled for service in the Total Exclusion Zone, which in fact did not happen until after the end of the war.

The ships performed excellently in Royal Navy service, with relatively low noise levels giving the 2031(I) towed sonar a range of more than 100 miles, better than that of the more advanced 2031(Z) sonar when fitted in the Type 22 frigates. However, all &quot;Leander&quot;s in Royal Navy service were decommissioned by the early 1990s due to the ships&#x27; ageing design and the high number of crew. &quot;Scylla&quot; was sunk on 27 March 2004 as an artificial reef off Cornwall, eleven years after her decommissioning in 1993.

===Running costs===
==Overseas service==
&quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates were also successfully exported to serve in the Royal New Zealand Navy and Chilean Navy; in the latter they were designated as the . Further frigates were modelled on the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates and were built under licence in Australia as the for the Royal Australian Navy, India as the and the Netherlands as the . Royal Navy ships were sold to the navies of Chile, Ecuador, New Zealand ( becoming and becoming HMNZS &quot;Southland&quot;), India and Pakistan.

Starting in 1986, the six &quot;Van Speijk&quot;-class ships were sold to the Indonesian Navy and renamed the , five of which are still in service. Pakistan decommissioned the last of its &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates, &quot;Zulfiqar&quot;, in January 2007, India decommissioned her last &quot;Leander&quot; class on 24 May 2012.

, the last steam-turbine driven &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate in the Royal New Zealand Navy, was decommissioned in Auckland on 31 March 2005 after 33 years operational service. In 2006 it was announced that the ship was to be sunk as a dive attraction in the Bay of Islands, and this was carried out on 3 November 2007 at Deep Water Cove. She lies near her sister ship .

<doc id="545032" wikidata="Q7940206" url="?curid=545032" title="Volition Records">
<text>Volition Records was a Sydney, Australia-based record label specialising in electronic music styles such as house, techno, synthpop, and trance. It was founded by Andrew Penhallow and was active from 1984 to around 1997.

Andrew Penhallow founded Volition after he earlier created GAP Records with Paul Gardiner (1945-2004), which licensed British post-punk recordings from UK labels Rough Trade and Factory Records as well as releasing Australian bands such as Pel Mel. He chose the name to reflect its meaning &quot;the faculty or power of using one&#x27;s will&quot;

Volition is widely credited with the early and successful promotion of techno and electro music - “what would usually be seen as underground music into the mainstream consciousness”. The label&#x27;s cult status attracted aficionados of the underground who could previously only buy imports of overseas dance acts. &quot;If you were all loved up with the dance music scene in the 1990s, you had several Volition CDs in your collection&quot;

Amongst the roster of Volition were Severed Heads, Boxcar, Itch-E and Scratch-E, Single Gun Theory, FSOM, Southend, Vision Four 5, Sexing The Cherry, and Robert Racic. Robert Racic (1964-1996) was a record producer and co-collaborator with many of the artists on the label, was integral to much of Volition&#x27;s output during most of the label&#x27;s existence and was, to some extent, its unofficial &quot;house producer&quot;. Volition also signed indie pop guitar bands such as the Falling Joys, Big Heavy Stuff, and Swordfish.

Severed Heads&#x27; “Dead Eyes Opened” reached No 16 on the ARIA Charts, South End’s Olympic tribute “The Winner Is….” Reached No 9, and Sexing The Cherry and Single Gun Theory also charted in the ARIA Top 50. Falling Joys charted on the album charts with Psychohum and Aerial.

Penhallow successfully lobbied the Australia Record Industry Association to introduce a Best Dance Release category in the annual ARIA Music Awards. In 1995, the first year of the category, three of the five nominations were Volition acts (and Volition won with Itch-E and Scratch-E). The following year, Itch-E and Scratch-E were again nominated and Volition act FSOM won in the category.

In 1994, Penhallow worked with New Zealand music producer Alan Jansson to release through Volition offshoot label Second Nature. Proud highlighted previously unrecorded or unknown Pacifika hip hop and RnB acts and is now regarded as one of the most essential New Zealand albums of all time.

Also in 1994, Penhallow co-founded the Boiler Room for the annual Australian music festival Big Day Out, run by Ken West and Viv Lees.

Ben Suthers from Big Day Out said, &quot;A whole pile of bands, like Severed Heads, Itch-E and Scratch-E, Boxcar, and Vision Four 5, they were all signed to Volition. Ken went to Andrew and went, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do a dance thing&#x27;. Andrew came up with the name Boiler Room, and I worked with him putting those shows together.&quot; As interest in raves and dance clubs grew, the Boiler Room went on to become one of the major draws of the Big Day Out and was copied throughout the world.

After Volition went into hiatus in 1997, Andrew Penhallow concentrated on artist management, music publishing, music synchs, and A&amp;R. He produced and compiled a dozen compilation albums of dance and electronic music sourced exclusively from Australian artists, producers, and DJs, including the Australian dance compilation series “A Higher Sound”.

Penhallow managed and worked with ARIA nominated hip hop artist Citizen Kay, blues rock artist Jack Biilman, Nantes and songwriter David Rogers, Quails and songwriter Amy Pez, DJ Adam Stivala (Jerkboy / Pablo Calimari), DJ Craig Obey, DJ Stephen Allkins (Love Tattoo), and country-tinged singer-songwriter T. Wilds among many others.

<doc id="545047" wikidata="Q65720" url="?curid=545047" title="Carl Hindenburg">
<text>Carl Friedrich Hindenburg (13 July 1741 – 17 March 1808) was a German mathematician born in Dresden. His work centered mostly on combinatorics and probability.
==Education==
Hindenburg did not attend school but was educated at home by a private tutor as arranged by his merchant father. He went to the University of Leipzig in 1757 and took courses in medicine, philosophy, Latin, Greek, physics, mathematics, and aesthetics. Hindenburg later published on philology in 1763 and 1769.

Hindenburg was mentored by Christian Fürchtegott Gellert, a popular lecturer in Leipzig who introduced Hindenburg to a student named Schönborn. Schönborn&#x27;s interest in mathematics influenced Hindenburg to go into the field as well. He obtained a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Leipzig in 1771.

==Career==
On obtaining his master&#x27;s degree at Leipzig in 1771, Hindenburg was made Privatdozent there.

In 1781, Hindenburg was appointed as professor of philosophy in the University of Leipzig. He would be appointed professor of physics in 1786 after presenting a dissertation on water pumps. Hindenburg served as academic dean at the University of Leipzig, where he was also Rector in 1792. He became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences on 5 August 1806.

==Research contributions==
Hindenburg&#x27;s first published mathematical publication, &quot;Beschreibung einer ganz neuen Art, nach einem bekannten Gesetze fortgehende Zahlen, durch Abzahlen oder Abmessen bequem und sicher zu finden&quot;, originated as a project to extend then-existing prime tables up to 5 million. In the book, he mechanically realizes, independent of the work done by Felkel, the sieve of Eratosthenes, which he then proceeds with rules to both optimize and organize. The book also contained results in linear diophantine analysis, decimal periods, combinations, and gave combinatorial significance to the digits of numbers written in decimal notation.

In 1778, he started publishing a series of works on combinatorics, particularly on probability, series and formulae for higher differentials. He worked on a generalization of the binomial theorem and was a major influence in Gudermann&#x27;s work on the expansion of functions into power series.

==Editorial work==
Hindenburg co-founded the first German mathematical journals. Between 1780 and 1800, he was involved at different times with the publishing of four different journals all relating to mathematics and its applications. Two of the journals, the Leipziger Magazin für reine und angewandte Mathematik (1786–1789) and the Archiv für reine und angewandte Mathematik (1795–1799), published Johann Heinrich Lambert&#x27;s Nachlass as edited by Johann Bernoulli. In 1796, he edited the &quot;Sammlung combinatorisch-analytischer Abhandlungen&quot;, which contained a claim that de Moivre&#x27;s multinomial theorem was “the most important proposition in all of mathematical analysis”.

==Students==
One of Hindenburg&#x27;s best students, according to Donald Knuth, is Heinrich August Rothe. Another student, Johann Karl Burckhardt published the book &quot;Theorie der Kettenbrüche&quot; after being encouraged by Hindenburg to work on continued fractions. He also influenced Christian Kramp&#x27;s work in combinatorics.

<text>Interesting Times is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It is the seventeenth book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series and is set in the Aurient (a fictional analogue of the Orient).

The title refers to the English expression, &quot;may you live in interesting times&quot;, which is typically presented as a translation from a traditional Chinese curse.

==Plot==
Two gods, Fate and the Lady, oppose each other in a game over the outcome of the struggle for the throne of the Agatean Empire on the Counterweight Continent.

The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork receives a demand that the &quot;Great Wizzard&quot; be sent to the distant Agatean Empire, and he orders Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully of Unseen University to comply. As the spelling, &quot;Wizzard,&quot; matches that on Rincewind&#x27;s hat, the faculty decide to send him. Using the machine Hex, they teleport him to the University from a desert island where he has been living since the events of &quot;Eric&quot;. They offer him the right to call himself a Wizard, which he never actually earned, if he agrees to be sent to Agatea. Teleportation requires an exchange of mass, and they end up exchanging him with a very heavy live cannon (which they extinguish upon its arrival). This results in Rincewind arriving in Agatea at a very high speed, but he lands safely in a snowbank.

Rincewind&#x27;s efforts to run from any kind of danger quickly embroil him in momentous events. He encounters his friend Cohen the Barbarian, now accompanied by a &quot;Silver Horde&quot; of elderly warriors and Ronald Saveloy, a former teacher. Cohen is planning to infiltrate the Empire and live a luxurious retirement by taking over as Emperor. Rincewind learns that the first Agatean Emperor supposedly conquered the land with the assistance of a &quot;Great Wizard&quot; and a &quot;Red Army.&quot; Now, a new &quot;Red Army&quot; movement of young people, dedicated mainly to the promulgation of mildly worded slogans, has been inspired by a supposed revolutionary tract, which turns out to be a travelogue of Ankh-Morpork written by Rincewind&#x27;s former traveling companion Twoflower, whom Rincewind frees from a dungeon and whose two daughters are leaders of the Red Army. It turns out that the villainous Grand Vizier, Lord Hong, has made the harmless Red Army appear to be a threat to the Empire and had Rincewind brought to Agatea so that he could blame the problems on foreigners, then put the &quot;revolution&quot; down violently and turn to the conquest of Ankh-Morpork, whose culture he secretly seeks to emulate. When Hong murders the Emperor with the intention of framing the Red Army, it creates the opportunity needed by the Silver Horde to infiltrate the palace. Cohen and Saveloy had hoped to conquer the Empire by simply installing Cohen as Emperor, since almost nobody has ever seen the Emperor&#x27;s face. But Lord Hong leads four other lords who had been vying against him for the throne to rally their armies against the Horde, to the chagrin of Saveloy who had been trying to civilize the barbarians.

Before the battle begins, Rincewind attempts to tip the balance in the Horde&#x27;s favor by spreading rumors amongst the encamped armies that the Horde is being supported by an army of &#x27;invisible vampire ghosts&#x27;, who Agateans believe inhabit the lands outside of the Empire. Since this belief is officially endorsed by the imperial authorities to maintain domestic order, dispelling the rumour proves difficult. As the battle begins, Rincewind inadvertently discovers the actual Red Army, a multitude of terra cotta warriors that can be controlled by magical armor that he accidentally dons. The automatons destroy the Agatean forces. However, Rincewind inadvertently wanders into a ditch and begins to sink. He realizes that the magic boots are weighing him down, and frees himself with Twoflower&#x27;s help. Cohen realizes that he is now recognized as the Emperor, and prepares proclamations to relax the regime&#x27;s oppression of the people. He invites Rincewind to serve as Chief Wizard and found his own university, which convinces Rincewind that something horrible is about to happen. Indeed, Lord Hong takes Rincewind hostage and plans to murder him on the steps of the palace. Just then, the faculty of Unseen University teleport Rincewind away. Twoflower challenges Hong to a duel, as his wife was killed in a battle waged by Hong. The cannon, re-lit by the faculty, then arrives and kills both Hong and Saveloy; Saveloy, despite never having managed to be a barbarian in life, decides to go to the warrior&#x27;s afterlife.

The Luggage had followed Rincewind to its native Agatea, but became distracted by meeting and mating with a female Luggage. Upon Rincewind&#x27;s disappearance, the Luggage leaves its mate and their offspring to once again follow its owner.

The Lady has won the game against Fate. She also interfered in Hex&#x27;s calculations so that Rincewind is teleported to the unexplored continent of XXXX where he lands safely, while an XXXXian kangaroo (instead of Rincewind) suffers a fatal collision with a wall at Unseen University. Rincewind meets XXXXian natives who give him a boomerang, with which he manages to hit himself in the head.

==Themes==

In an interview republished at L-space, the Terry Pratchett wiki, Pratchett explains the concepts behind the novel. &quot;It&#x27;d be easier for people to read &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, than to sum it up, but I would say that one of the things I wanted to develop in the story was the strange way in which revolutions can turn into tyrannies. People struggle to over-throw tyrants, then suddenly find that they&#x27;re ruled by &quot;The Government&quot; once again - and popular uprisings don&#x27;t stop often to ask common people what it is they need.&quot;

&quot;Interesting Times&quot; was well received by critics and readers alike. The book enjoys consistently high reviews on both Amazon and Goodreads.

The San Francisco Chronicle called the novel &quot;unadulterated fun… Witty… Frequently hilarious&quot; and remarked that &quot;Pratchett parodies everything in sight.&quot;

A review at AV Club, meanwhile, called it &quot;a surprisingly thoughtful parable about oppressive government, East-West cultural relations, and revolutionary theory&quot;

<text>The Prospero satellite, also known as the X-3, was launched by the United Kingdom in 1971. It was designed to undertake a series of experiments to study the effects of the space environment on communications satellites and remained operational until 1973, after which it was contacted annually for over 25 years. Although &quot;Prospero&quot; was the first British satellite to have been launched successfully by a British rocket, Black Arrow, the first British satellite placed in orbit was &quot;Ariel 1&quot;, launched in April 1962 on a US rocket.

==Construction==
&quot;Prospero&quot; was built by the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough. Initially called Puck, it was designed to conduct experiments to test the technologies necessary for communication satellites. Two experimental solar cells setups were tested. One was a test of a lightweight cell and mounting. The other was an attempt to replace the standard fused silica cover of solar cells with a cerium oxide-based cover. Designs for telemetry and power systems were also tested. It also carried a micrometeoroid detector, to measure the presence of very small particles. The detector worked on the principle of impact ionisation. When the Ministry of Defence cancelled the Black Arrow programme, the development team decided to continue with the project but renamed the satellite Prospero when it was announced it would be the last launch attempt using a British rocket. An earlier Black Arrow launch, carrying the Orba X-2 satellite, had failed to achieve orbit after a premature second stage shut-down.

==Launch==

&quot;Prospero&quot; was launched at 04:09 GMT on 28 October 1971, from Launch Area 5B (LA-5B) at Woomera, South Australia, on a Black Arrow rocket, making Britain the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit using a domestically developed carrier rocket. The Black Arrow&#x27;s final stage Waxwing rocket also entered orbit, &quot;rather too enthusiastically&quot;, as it continued to thrust after separation and collided with &quot;Prospero&quot;, detaching one of the satellite&#x27;s four radio antennae.

==Operations==

The satellite was operated from R.A.E Lasham. For the satellite&#x27;s early orbits additional reporting was provided by the European Space Research Organisation&#x27;s ESTRACK system. In regular operation real time data support was provided by a Science Research Council station at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.

==Results==

The lightweight solar cell design was found to be successful. The cerium oxide cover was not, with the solar cell using it showing an increased rate of degradation.

==Status==
&quot;Prospero&quot;″s tape recorders stopped working in 1973. As was noted in an episode of the BBC television series &quot;Coast&quot;, radio transmissions from &quot;Prospero&quot; could still be heard on 137.560 MHz in 2004, though the signals used in the episode would actually come from an Orbcomm satellite, rather than &quot;Prospero&quot; (as the later Orbcomm used the same 137.560 MHz frequency since &quot;Prospero&quot; was considered no longer active). &quot;Prospero&quot; had officially been deactivated in 1996, when the UK&#x27;s Defence Research Establishment decommissioned their satellite tracking station at Lasham, Hampshire but the satellite had been turned on in past years on its anniversary. It is in a low Earth orbit and is not expected to decay until about 2070, almost 100 years after its launch.

In September 2011 a team at University College London&#x27;s Mullard Space Science Laboratory announced plans to re-establish communications with &quot;Prospero&quot;, in time for the satellite&#x27;s 40th anniversary. As of September 2012, not much progress had been made in establishing contact with the satellite due to time constraints. At perigee, &quot;Prospero&quot; can be seen through binoculars at magnitude +6 overhead, steady.

<doc id="545059" wikidata="Q5334860" url="?curid=545059" title="Ed Gillespie">
<text>Edward Walter Gillespie (born August 1, 1961) is an American politician, strategist, and lobbyist who served as the 61st Chair of the Republican National Committee from 2003 to 2005 and was counselor to the President from 2007 to 2009 during the Presidency of George W. Bush. In 2012 Gillespie was a senior member of the Mitt Romney presidential campaign.

Gillespie founded the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates with Jack Quinn, and founded Ed Gillespie Strategies.

Gillespie ran in the 2014 United States Senate election in Virginia. Gillespie narrowly lost to incumbent Mark Warner by a margin of 0.8%. Gillespie ran for Governor of Virginia in the 2017 election. After winning the Republican primary, he was defeated in the general election by Democratic nominee Ralph Northam; Gillespie received 1.17 million votes (45%) to Northam&#x27;s 1.40 million (54%) in the election.

In 2020, Gillespie was hired by AT&amp;T to serve as senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs. Previously, he served as co-chairman of Sard Verbinnen &amp; Co.&#x27;s public affairs practice.

==Early life==
Gillespie was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, and raised in the Browns Mills section of Pemberton Township, New Jersey. He is the son of Conny (Carroll) and Sean (later John) Patrick Gillespie, an immigrant from Ireland who grew up in North Philadelphia. His parents owned a small grocery store in New Jersey, and Gillespie worked there after school.

He is a graduate of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and Pemberton Township High School. While at CUA he began his career on Capitol Hill as a U.S. Senate parking lot attendant. One of his co-workers there was an intern for Representative Andy Ireland of Florida, and through him, Gillespie got the same job after he graduated from college.

==Political career==
Gillespie, raised in a Democratic family, began his political career as intern for Andy Ireland, at the time a Democrat from Florida. In 1984, Ireland joined the Republican party with Gillespie following, saying, &quot;I liked President Reagan&#x27;s approach to governing and it just made sense to me.&quot; In his book, &quot;Winning Right,&quot; Gillespie described himself as someone who &quot;all but had &#x27;Democrat&#x27; stamped on his birth certificate,&quot; but had become increasingly uncomfortable with the leftward tilt of the national party and believed it wasn&#x27;t taking the threat of Communism seriously. As he saw it, he and Ireland were classic Reagan Democrats who became Republicans–&quot;a southern conservative and a young northeastern ethnic Catholic who no longer felt comfortable in the party of their heritage.&quot;

He worked as telephone solicitor for the Republican National Committee in 1985, and later worked for a decade as a top aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX), and was a principal drafter of the GOP&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Contract With America.&quot;

In 1996 he served as communications director for the RNC. In 1999, Gillespie worked as the Press Secretary for the Presidential campaign of John Kasich until his withdrawal from the race and endorsement of George W. Bush. In 2000, Gillespie served as senior communications advisor for the presidential campaign of Bush, organizing the party convention program in Philadelphia for Bush&#x27;s nomination and Bush&#x27;s inauguration ceremony. He played an aggressive role as spokesman for the Bush campaign during the vote recount in Florida. In 2002, he was a strategist for Elizabeth Dole&#x27;s 2002 Senate campaign.

=== Lobbyist ===
In 1997, Gillespie joined the lobbying firm BGR Group (Barbour, Griffith &amp; Rogers), and advised Senate Republicans during the impeachment of Bill Clinton.

In 2000, Gillespie founded the lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates with Jack Quinn, and within a year had an income of $8.5 million and was 11th on Fortune&#x27;s list of the most powerful lobbying firms in the US. One of the firm&#x27;s clients was Enron, which paid it $1,225,000, including $700,000 to lobby the Department of Energy and the Executive Office of the President to resist efforts to re-regulate the western electricity market during the California Electricity Crisis. Gillespie has said that he was unaware of Enron&#x27;s deceptive accounting practices. By the end of 2002, Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates had received $27.4 million in lobbying fees.

In 2007, Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates represented more than 100 clients. The firm lobbied on behalf of AT&amp;T, Bank of America, and Microsoft in the years 2001–2007, earning more than $3.2 million. In 2016, the firm reported $17.2 million in revenue from federal lobbying. The firm pitched to potential clients that Gillespie, due to his involvement with the White House and association with individuals in power, could leverage those relationships to benefit clients.

In 2016, Gillespie lobbied on behalf of the health insurance company Anthem, as the nation&#x27;s second-largest insurance firm tried to merge with third-largest insurance firm Cigna. A federal judge blocked the mergers, citing insurance regulators who said the merger would raise costs and reduce competition in the health insurance market.

Gillespie shut down his lobbying firm Ed Gillespie Strategies shortly before launching his campaign for governor in January 2017.

The conservative government watchdog Judicial Watch said that Gillespie&#x27;s ties to corporations may pose a conflict of interest for him as governor, and that this is a &quot;nonpartisan concern&quot;. Gillespie&#x27;s former clients Anthem, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, and Bank of America have ongoing interests in the state of Virginia, and these corporations or their top executives have donated to the Gillespie 2017 campaign. Gillespie voluntarily released the list of his clients, disclosing more than is required by state law.

=== Chairman of the RNC ===
In 2003, Gillespie was selected as Chairman of the RNC, serving in that role through the 2004 elections that saw President Bush win re-election and Republicans retain control of the House and Senate. He did not give up his stake in the lobbying firm when he took that job, which caused controversy. During the campaign, he was regularly referred to as &quot;President Bush&#x27;s pit bull.&quot; In 2005 Bush appointed Gillespie to lead the process to nominate a successor to Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor on the Supreme Court; that process led to the selection and confirmation of Samuel Alito.

His book &quot;Winning Right&quot; was released in September 2006.

Gillespie served as Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia from December 2006 to June 2007. In the 2006 Virginia Senate elections he served as spokesman for defeated Virginia Senator George Allen. He had been tapped by Allen as a political adviser for a possible presidential run in 2008 before that loss. In February 2009, Virginia Attorney General Bob McDonnell announced that Gillespie would serve as general chairman of his campaign for governor. Gillespie has served as an adviser to American Crossroads.

===White House counselor===

In late June 2007, President Bush brought Gillespie into the White House on a full-time basis, to replace the departing Counselor to the President Dan Bartlett with the mandate to help raise Bush&#x27;s flagging popularity ratings. When Karl Rove also departed in August, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Gillespie as stepping up to do part of Rove&#x27;s job in the White House. A later &quot;Post&quot; article described Gillespie&#x27;s role orchestrating a PR unit dedicated to &quot;selling the surge to American voters and the media.&quot;

Later in 2007, the Washington Post reported that Gillespie had taken a substantial pay cut to become Bush&#x27;s counselor. &quot;A disclosure form shows he made nearly $1.3 million in salary and bonus in the previous 18 months at his consulting and public affairs firm... His annual government salary is $168,000. The form, obtained by the Associated Press, reports that Gillespie, ... a former Capitol Hill aide who co-founded his lobbying shop in 2000 ..., has accumulated a fortune estimated to be between $7.86 million and $19.4 million.&quot;

===Post-White House===
In 2009, Gillespie was the chairman of Bob McDonnell&#x27;s successful campaign for governor of Virginia.

In January 2010, Gillespie was announced in as the national chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), which helps elect state attorneys general, lieutenant governors, secretaries of state and state house and senate candidates. After Gillespie was announced chairman the RSLC is reported to have laundered $1.5 million from the Poarch Band of Creek Indians to Alabama Speaker Mike Hubbard and a group associated with Jack Abramoff. From January 2010 to January 2014 the RSLC paid Gilespie $654,000. Gillespie was not legally listed as the RSLC chairman until February 2011, when the organization filed updated documents with the IRS.

In 2010, together with Republican strategist Karl Rove, Ed Gillespie helped get the Super Pac American Crossroads &quot;off the ground.&quot; The organization&#x27;s goal was to supplement campaign spending for Republicans, independently of the Republican party. &#x27;&quot;Obama had $1.1 billion in 2008,&quot; says Gillespie..&quot;John McCain and his supporters spent $634 million. That&#x27;s a sizable gap.&quot; American Crossroads, he boasts, will be the place where the real money goes to &quot;play.&quot;&#x27;

In April 2012, Gillespie became a senior advisor to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign.

===2014 U.S. Senate run===

In December 2013, Gillespie told &quot;Politico&quot; that he was considering a first-time political run in 2014 against Mark Warner, a popular Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator in Virginia.

In January 2014, he officially launched his candidacy. He named Chris Leavitt, campaign manager of Mark Obenshain&#x27;s 2013 run for Virginia Attorney general, his campaign manager. On June 7, 2014, he became the Republican nominee after receiving about 60% of the vote at the state party convention.

Although Warner had been consistently leading Gillespie by double-digit margins in polls before October, Gillespie nearly upset Warner on Election Day, losing by a margin of just 0.8% and 17,723 votes, with 37% turnout. Gillespie conceded the race on November 7, 2014.

===2017 gubernatorial run===

Speculation began immediately after Gillespie&#x27;s narrow 2014 loss that he would run for Governor of Virginia in 2017. In October 2015, Gillespie confirmed reports that he was preparing to run for governor in 2017. He officially declared his candidacy in November 2016. Gillespie was considered the favorite to win the Republican nomination.

On June 13, 2017, Gillespie narrowly defeated his primary opponent Corey Stewart to win the Republican nomination for governor and was set to face incumbent lieutenant governor Ralph Northam, the Democratic nominee, in the November general election.

In the 2017 gubernatorial campaign up to June 2017, Gillespie ran as an establishment Republican and focused on economic issues rather than social issues. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in July 2017, Gillespie &quot;sought to strike a delicate balance when pressed about Mr. Trump, who is highly unpopular here. He refused to say Mr. Trump&#x27;s name, but warned that Mr. Northam, a Democrat, risked hurting Virginia&#x27;s economy—which relies greatly on the federal government—by attacking the president so fiercely.&quot; According to &quot;CNN&quot;, even though Gillespie has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, the &quot;endorsement isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere on Gillespie&#x27;s campaign website or his social media pages. Gillespie doesn&#x27;t discuss Trump unless he&#x27;s prompted to do so. He doesn&#x27;t criticize the President, but he also doesn&#x27;t make an effort to embrace him, either.&quot; In October 2017, Vice President Mike Pence held a joint rally with Gillespie. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Gillespie campaign preferred Pence&#x27;s involvement in the race over Trump&#x27;s.

In August 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Gillespie hired Jack Morgan, an operative in the Trump 2016 campaign for president. Morgan has made controversial statements, such as saying that the country is on the brink of civil war and that communists are behind efforts to remove confederate monuments. Morgan had earlier in 2017 called Gillespie a &quot;lobbyist&quot; and said that it would be a &quot;disaster&quot; to elect him governor. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, even though the Gillespie campaign distanced itself from Trump the person, it sought to motivate voters with the same &quot;culturally and racially tinged appeals&quot; of the Trump 2016 campaign. Most of Gillespie&#x27;s ad spending has gone towards commercials on confederate monuments and illegal immigration. In October 2017, former president Barack Obama took what &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described as &quot;the unusual step&quot; of criticizing Gillespie over his use of ads on Latino gang violence which he said sowed fear and were &quot;as cynical as politics gets&quot;.

After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Gillespie condemned the far-right protestors, saying, &quot;[We] reject the people who came in, largely from outside our Commonwealth, and brought their hate, their white supremacism, their neo-Nazism with them.&quot; After Donald Trump&#x27;s controversial comment that there were &quot;fine people on both sides,&quot; Gillespie said there was &quot;no moral comparison between white supremacists and &#x27;those that show up to condemn them for espousing that kind of hate-filled speech.&#x27;

Gillespie criticized Northam for casting the deciding &quot;no&quot; vote to stop a Republican bill which would have banned sanctuary cities in Virginia. During the campaign, Gillespie and Trump accused Northam of being responsible for the increased activities of the MS-13 gangs and of being &quot;in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the streets&quot; and that this contributed to the surge in MS-13 violence; a notion that FactCheck.org found to be &quot;misleading&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and CNN noted that there are no actual sanctuary cities in Virginia and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editorial board condemned the ads in an editorial called &quot;Gillespie&#x27;s ads are poisonous to Virginia and the nation&quot;. Gillespie himself acknowledged that Virginia did not have sanctuary cities. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; furthermore noted that there is no evidence that sanctuary cities increase crime or gang activity.

In October, the Latino Victory Fund, which supported Northam, released an ad in which a pickup truck, adorned with a Gillespie bumper sticker, a &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me&quot; license plate, and a Confederate flag, chases down minority children and corners them in an alley—one of the children in the ad then wakes up, revealing the scene to have been a nightmare. Although Northam and his campaign were not involved with the ad, Northam initially defended it, saying Gillespie&#x27;s own ads &quot;have promoted fearmongering, hatred, bigotry, racial divisiveness,&quot; and adding, &quot;I mean, it&#x27;s upset a lot of communities, and they have the right to express their views as well.&quot; The ad was pulled the following day in the hours after a terrorist attack in New York City, in which a man killed several people by running them over with a truck. Northam then distanced himself from the ad, re-emphasizing that it was not released by his campaign and saying that it is not one that he would have chosen to run. A spokesman for the campaign has said that the Latino Victory Fund&#x27;s decision to pull the ad was &quot;appropriate and the right thing to do.&quot; FOX 5 DC reported that the Northam campaign had accepted $62,000 as an in-kind media contribution from the Latino Victory Fund.

According to the Virginia Public Access Project, as of November 5, Northam had raised $33.8 million to Gillespie&#x27;s $24.5 million.

In October 2017, &quot;National Review&quot; posted an analysis of the Gillespie campaign as an important example of whether and how mainstream Republican politics, represented by Gillespie, can produce victories in a purple state in the &quot;era of Trumpism&quot;, and said that the outcome would effect Republican strategies in future races.

Gillespie received 1.17 million votes (45%) to Northam&#x27;s 1.40 million (54%) in the election.

==Political positions==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2014 that Gillespie had &quot;ties to both Republican grass-roots and establishment wings&quot;.

=== Abortion ===
In January 2017 he participated in the anti-abortion &quot;March for Life&quot;. Gillespie said he would support a ban on late-term abortions after 20 weeks in Virginia, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or pregnancies that endanger the life of the mother. Gillespie was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee in his 2017 run for governor.

Gillespie pledged to sign legislation to defund Planned Parenthood; Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed such legislation.

=== Confederate monuments ===
In August 2017, Gillespie signed a petition opposing the removal of Confederate monuments in Virginia. Gillespie said that removing the monuments was an attempt to erase history. In a September 2017 gubernatorial debate, Gillespie said that the statues were history and could be used to teach people about slavery in the South. He said a better remedy would be to erect statues honoring people like Douglas Wilder, a former Virginia governor who was the nation&#x27;s first African-American to be elected governor.

=== Economy ===

In September 2017 Gillespie called for a 10 percent across-the-board income tax cut.

=== Education ===
Gillespie has called for the expansion of publicly funded schools that are operated privately.

=== Energy and environment ===
In a debate in 2014, Gillespie was asked by his opponent if he thought there was enough evidence to support climate change. Gillespie at first dodged the question but when pressed again, answered, &quot;I believe there is ample scientific evidence that contributes to climate change but I&#x27;m not entirely dismissive of those who have a different point of view.&quot;

In September 2017 Gillespie supported President Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Gillespie supported President Trump&#x27;s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce emissions from coal-burning power plants. Gillespie opposes efforts at the state level to limit carbon emissions. Gillespie opposes Virginia joining a so-called &quot;state climate alliance&quot; to mitigate the effects of climate change. Gillespie supports offshore drilling.

In 2014 and 2017 he voiced support for the Keystone Pipeline, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, and Mountain Valley Pipeline and criticized federal regulations that &quot;[slow] down the development of energy infrastructure.&quot;

===Ethics laws===
In his 2017 gubernatorial campaign, Gillespie pledged to push a ban on candidates using campaign funds for personal expenses, to require administration officials to wait at least two years before lobbying their prior office, and to require more frequent disclosures of potential conflicts of interest. He also proposed prohibiting candidates from using funds raised for one campaign in a campaign for a different office; prohibiting fundraising during special legislative sessions; and live-streaming certain public cabinet meetings and all agency and board meetings. In response to criticism of his lobbying history, Gillespie&#x27;s campaign said he and his wife would place their assets in a blind trust and that he would be &quot;an honest, ethical, principled, hard-working, faithful servant-leader worthy of Virginia.&quot;

=== Guns ===
Gillespie has called for rescinding legislation that banned members of the public from carrying firearms in state government buildings. Gillespie is open to the idea of banning bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic firearm to fire in rapid succession.

=== Health care ===
In 2014, Gillespie said that he was opposed to the 2010 Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare), criticizing it for its &quot;negative impacts&quot; and stating that he would &quot;repeal and replace it.&quot; In 2017, Gillespie said that he opposed Medicaid expansion and said that Virginia should create an interstate compact allowing insurance providers to sell health insurance plans across state lines.

=== Immigration ===
In July and August 2017, Gillespie said that he opposes &quot;sanctuary cities&quot;, which adopt policies designed to not prosecute people solely for being undocumented. In February 2017, he supported a bill that would prohibit localities in Virginia from enacting sanctuary policies. He has campaigned on tougher immigration enforcement.

In September 2017, Gillespie said that he supported Donald Trump&#x27;s executive order to ban immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. That same month, Gillespie, after initially declining to take a stance on Trump&#x27;s decision to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—which gives temporary stay to some unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as minors—Gillespie said that he did not &quot;believe that children should be punished for decisions that were not their own, but at the same time, it is important for us to enforce our laws&quot;.

Shortly after the Trump administration announced that it would rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Gillespie said that &quot;dreamers&quot; should not be deported.

In his 2006 book, &quot;Winning Right&quot;, Gillespie wanted to offer temporary work visas to undocumented workers in the US. Asked in 2017 if he still held that view, Gillespie said he did.

=== LGBT rights ===
In 2004, as chairman of the RNC, Gillespie opposed same-sex marriage and supported the Republican platform plank in support of constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. In 2014, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, Gillespie renounced this position, saying he no longer supported such an amendment.

In September 2017 he said he would oppose any legislation that would dictate which bathrooms that transgender individuals could use, such as the controversial North Carolina Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act. Earlier, in January 2017, Gillespie did not take a firm position when the Virginia General Assembly was considering a bathroom bill, opting instead to criticize the Obama administration for mandating that public schools allow transgender students to use the restrooms of their choice while saying that localities should decide on the issue.

=== Marijuana ===
Gillespie opposes marijuana decriminalization because it &quot;sends the wrong signal&quot; to young people. Gillespie has called for changing the punishment for marijuana possession so that no criminal charges would be filed on the first two occasions that someone is caught with marijuana, but that the third time should carry criminal charges because by then &quot;you really should know better.&quot;

=== Redistricting ===
In a 2017 gubernatorial debate with Ralph Northam, in response to a question about redistricting following the 2020 Census, Gillespie said that experience in other states showed that it was &quot;hard to take the politics out of politics.&quot;

=== Restoration of rights ===
Gillespie favors restoring voting rights to felons &quot;who have paid their debt to society and are living an honest life&quot; but opposes a blanket restoration of rights to all felons. In the final weeks of the 2017 gubernatorial campaign, Gillespie began running an ad criticizing Democrats for restoring voting rights to more than 200,000 felons, including John Bowen, whose rights were restored based on his completing sentence for an earlier conviction while he was awaiting trial on a new charge of possessing one of the largest child pornography collections in Virginia&#x27;s history.

==Personal life==
Gillespie met his wife Cathy at a congressional softball game and together they have a son and two daughters.

<text>The Defence Research Establishments were a number of separate UK Ministry of Defence Research Establishments, dating back to World War II, World War I, or even earlier. Each establishment had its own head; known as the Director or the Superintendent. Prior to the formation of the Ministry of Defence each of the three Services, i.e. the Royal Air Force, the Admiralty and the War Office, had their own research establishments; although some establishments had tri-service functions.

==World War II==
At the beginning of World War II there were about a dozen research and development establishments. The main ones were:
* The Royal Aircraft Establishment - Air
* The Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment - Air
* The Telecommunications Research Establishment - Air
* The Admiralty Research Laboratory - Sea
* The Admiralty Compass Observatory - Sea
* The Naval Construction Research Establishment - Sea
* The Armaments Research Department - Triservice

==Formation, merging and breakup==
Many establishments were formed, merged or changed their names over time to meet the needs of the UK Government at the time. These changes also involved the opening of new sites, operating across multiple sites, change of site location; and closing of sites.

For example, the Explosives Research and Development Establishment (ERDE), merged with the Rocket Propulsion Establishment and became the Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment (PERME). PERME became part of the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE).

== Amalgamation into DERA and split into QinetiQ and Dstl ==
Some of these establishments were merged in 1991 to form the Defence Research Agency (DRA). More were added to DRA in 1995 to form the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).

DERA was split up in the early 2000s, with the major part becoming known as QinetiQ and the more sensitive parts retained as Dstl.

<text>An intendant (; ; ) was, and sometimes still is, a public official, especially in France, Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. The intendancy system was a centralizing administrative system developed in France. In the War of the Spanish Succession of 1701 to 1714 the French royal House of Bourbon secured its hold on the throne of Spain; it extended a French-style intendancy system to Spain and Portugal - and subsequently worldwide through the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire. Regions were divided into districts, each administered by an intendant.
The title continues in use in Spain and in parts of Spanish America for particular government officials.

== Development of the system in France==
Intendants were royal civil servants in France under the Old Regime. A product of the centralization policies of the French crown, intendants were appointed &quot;commissions,&quot; and not purchasable hereditary &quot;offices,&quot; which thus prevented the abuse of sales of royal offices and made them more tractable and subservient emissaries of the king. Intendants were sent to supervise and enforce the king&#x27;s will in the provinces and had jurisdiction over three areas: finances, policing and justice.

Their missions were always temporary, which helped reduce favorable bias toward a province, and were focused on royal inspection. Article 54 of the Code Michau described their functions as &quot;to learn about all crimes, misdemeanors and financial misdealings committed by our officials and of other things concerning our service and the tranquility of our people&quot; (&quot;informer de tous crimes, abus et malversations commises par nos officiers et autres choses concernant notre service et le soulagement de notre peuple&quot;).

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the intendants were chosen from the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot; (&quot;administrative nobility&quot;) or the upper-bourgeoisie. Generally, they were masters of requests in the &quot;Conseil des parties&quot;. They were chosen by the Controller-General of Finances who asked the advice of the Secretary of State for War for those who were to be sent in border provinces. They were often young: Charles Alexandre de Calonne became an intendant at the age of 32, Turgot and Louis Bénigne François Berthier de Sauvigny at the age of 34, and Louis-Urbain-Aubert de Tourny at the age of 40.

A symbol of royal centralization and absolutism, the intendant had numerous adversaries. Those nostalgic for an administration based on noble lineage (such as Saint-Simon) saw intendants as parvenus and usurpers of noble power. Partisans of a less absolute monarchy (such as Fénelon) called for them to be abolished. Jacques Necker, the only Minister of Finances since 1720 who had not himself been an intendant, accused them of incompetence because of their youth and social aspirations. The &quot;cahiers de doléances&quot; of 1789 depicted them as over zealous agents of fiscal policies which weighed heavily on the people.

The term &quot;intendant&quot; was also used for certain positions close to the Controller-General (see this term for more information):
* intendants of finance
* intendants of commerce
* intendants of the sovereign council

In the same way, the term &quot;intendant général&quot; was used for certain commissioned positions close to the State Secretaries of War and of the Navy.

===History===
As early as the 15th century, the French kings sent commissioners to the provinces to report on royal and administrative issues and to undertake any necessary action. These agents of the king were recruited from among the masters of requests, the Councillors of State and members of the Parlements or the Court of Accounts. Their mission was always for a specific mandate and lasted for a limited period. Along with these, there were also commissioners sent to the army, in charge of provisioning the army, policing and finances; they would supervise accountants, providers, merchants, and generals, and attend war councils and tribunals for military crimes. Such commissioners are found in Corsica as early as 1553, in Bourges in 1592, in Troyes in 1594, and in Limoges in 1596.

When Henry IV ascended the throne in 1589, one of his prime focuses was to reduce the privileges of the provincial governors who, in theory, represented &quot;the presence of the king in his province&quot; but had, during the civil wars of the early modern period, proven themselves to be highly intractable; these positions had long been held by only the highest ranked noble families in the realm. The Intendants to the provinces —- the term &quot;Intendant&quot; appears around 1620 during the reign of Louis XIII – became an effective tool of regional control.

Under Louis XIII&#x27;s minister Cardinal Richelieu, with France&#x27;s entry into the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1635, the Intendants became a permanent institution in France. No longer mere inspectors, their role became one of government administrators. During the Fronde in 1648, the members of Parlement of the &quot;Chambre Saint-Louis&quot; demanded that the Intendants be suppressed; Mazarin and Anne of Austria gave in to these demands except in the case of border provinces threatened by Spanish or Imperial attack. At the end of the Fronde, the Intendants were reinstated.

When Louis XIV (1643–1715) was in power, the Marquis of Louvois, War Secretary between 1677 and 1691, further expanded the power of the provincial intendants. They monitored Louis&#x27;s refinements of the French military, including the institution of a merit promotion system and a policy of enlistment limited to single men for periods of four years. After 1680, Intendants in France had a permanent position in a fixed region (or &quot;généralité&quot;); their official titles being &quot;intendant de justice, police et finances&quot;, &quot;commissaires départis dans les généralités du royaume pour l&#x27;exécution des ordres du roi&quot; (or &quot;de Sa Majesté&quot;).

The position of Intendant remained in existence until the French Revolution. The title was maintained thereafter for military officers with responsibility for financial auditing at regimental level and above.

A 2021 study, which used a dataset of 430 intendants from 1640 to 1789, found that less than half of these officials went through the legally-specified training path. The study raised questions about the impersonal nature of these bureaucrats, with evidence indicating that familial and marital ties were factors in appointments, and that appointment duration had wide variability.

===Functions===
Appointed and revoked by the king and reporting to the Controller-General of Finances, the Intendant in his &quot;généralité&quot; had at his service a small team of secretaries. In the 18th century, the &quot;généralité&quot; was subdivided into &quot;subdelegations&quot; at the head of which was placed a &quot;subdelegate&quot; (having also a team of secretaries) chosen by the Intendant. In this way, the Intendant was relatively understaffed given his large jurisdiction.

===Notable intendants===
* Claude-François Bertrand de Boucheporn, in Corsica then Pau, Bayonne and Auch
* Paul Esprit Marie de la Bourdonnaye in Poitiers
* Charles Alexandre de Calonne in Metz, then in Lille, future Controller-General of Finances
* Nicolas-François Dupré de Saint-Maur in Bordeaux
* Antoine-Martin Chaumont de La Galaizière in Soissons then in Lorraine
* Jean-Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon in Poitiers
* Louis-Urbain-Aubert de Tourny in Limoges, then in Bordeaux
* Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot in Limoges, future Controller-General of Finances

===New France===
The French North American colony of New France, which later became the Canadian province of Quebec, also had a senior official called an intendant, who was responsible to the French King. New France&#x27;s first intendant was Jean Talon, comte d&#x27;Orsainville in 1665, and the last one, at the time of the British conquest of Quebec was François Bigot.

==Spain and Spanish Empire==
Intendants were introduced into Spain and the Spanish Empire during the eighteenth-century Bourbon Reforms. The reforms were designed by the new dynasty to make political administration more efficient and to promote economic, commercial, and fiscal development of their new realms. An &quot;intendente&quot; was in charge of a Spanish administrative unit, called an intendencia, which could include one or more provinces. The &quot;intendente&quot; was appointed directly by the Crown and had responsibility to oversee the treasury, the collection of taxes, and corruption practices and to promote agriculture and economic growth in general. With fiscal powers that gave them a say in almost all administrative, ecclesiastical and military matters, &quot;intendentes&quot; were conceived by the Bourbon kings to be a check on other local officials (who in the past couple of centuries had come to gain their position through the sale of offices or inheritance), just as the &quot;intendants&quot; had been in France a century earlier. Throughout the 18th century the Bourbons experimented with the powers and duties of the intendants, both in Spain and overseas, so what follows is only a general description of the Spanish intendancy. In any given area at any given time, the duties of the intendant would have been specified by the laws that established that particular intendancy.

The first &quot;intendencias&quot; were established in Spain after 1711, during the War of the Spanish Succession on the advice of Jean Orry, who had been sent by Louis XIV of France to help his young grandson Philip V set up his new government. The first intendants (&quot;superintendentes generales del ejército&quot;) oversaw the finances of the army and of the territories conquered by the Bourbons, and after the war, they were made permanent (&quot;intendentes de ejército y provincia&quot;). (After 1724, most intendancies lost their military character except in areas with a captaincy general and in Navarre.) In 1749 an intendancy was established in every province, with the intendant also holding the office of corregidor of the capital city. (The offices were separated again in 1766). District &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot; or &quot;coregidores&quot; were subordinated to the provincial &quot;intendente-corregidor&quot; and assisted him in managing the province and implementing reforms.

As a result of the Seven Years&#x27; War an intendancy was set up in Cuba in 1764. The Cuban intendant had oversight of the army&#x27;s and the royal treasury&#x27;s finances. (Two new intendancies with oversight only over the treasury were established in 1786 in Camagüey and Santiago de Cuba.) After a two years of experimentation with the new office, an intendancy was introduced in Louisiana (1764).

That same year &quot;Visitador General&quot; José de Gálvez created a plan to set up intendancies in New Spain (Mexico). The first one was set up in central Mexico in 1786, followed in 1787 by Veracruz, Puebla, Valladolid in Michoacan, Guadalajara, Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Durango, Sonora, and in 1789 Mérida, the main city in Yucatán. These administrative changes codified existing regional divisions of Center (Mexico, Veracruz, Puebla, Michoacan), South (Oaxaca, Mérida), and North (Zacatecas, Guanajuato, San Luis Potosí, Durango, and Sonora).

In 1776 Gálvez, now Minister of the Indies, established an intendancy (&quot;superintendencia&quot;) for all of Venezuela in 1776, and several in the Río de la Plata in 1783. Most of the overseas intendants were assisted by officials (&quot;subdelegados&quot;) who replaced the old &quot;corregidores&quot; or &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot;. Initially intendancies were held by a separate person from the viceroy or the governor, but eventually in many places the offices were granted to one person due to conflicts that emerged between these two.

More intendancies were established in Quito, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico (1784), Guatemala, more areas of New Spain, Chile (1786) and Cuenca (1786). The Revolt of the Comuneros prevented their installation in New Granada.

==Portugal and Portuguese Empire==

In Portugal, historically, the title &quot;intendant&quot; (&quot;intendente&quot; in Portuguese) has been mainly associated with police roles.

From 1760 to 1832, the head of the Police of the Kingdom of Portugal had the title of &quot;Intendant General of the Police of the Court and of the Kingdom&quot;. A similar title - that of &quot;Intendant General of the Public Security&quot; - was used from 1928 to 1932 to designate the head of the Portuguese Civil Police.

==Current use in Hispanic and Lusophone countries==

===Portugal===
Presently, intendant is a rank of officer in the Public Security Police, roughly equivalent to the military rank of lieutenant-colonel. Analogously, the police rank of sub-intendant corresponds to the rank of major, while the police rank of superintendent corresponds to the rank of colonel.

The rank insignia of an intendant consists of a dark blue epaulet with two crossed horsewhips inside a laurel wreath and two PSP stars. Each PSP star consists in a six points silver star with the &quot;SP&quot; monogram in the center. The rank insignia of a sub-intendant is similar but with only a single PSP star.

=== Spain ===
Nowadays in the Spanish armed forces, the title Intendant refers to a Colonel in the Supply Branch either in the Navy, Army or Air Force. It is also used in some branches of the administration such as the Catalan Police, (&quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot; in Catalan) or in some Autonomous Communities (&quot;Comunidades Autónomas&quot; in Spanish).

===Argentina===
In Argentina, &quot;intendente&quot; (m) or &quot;intendenta&quot; (f) refers to city mayors – heads of government of municipalities (or &quot;partidos&quot; in Buenos Aires Province). This meaning is not at all connected to the usage in other countries. Spanish-language media in countries other than Argentina tend to refer to Argentine city mayors as &quot;alcaldes&quot;, which is the most common Spanish word for mayor.
In the Argentine Army, &quot;Intendencia&quot; is the Spanish name of the Quartermaster Corps, and its members are informally called &quot;intendentes&quot;.
In some organizations, such as clubs, gated communities, large companies, etc., &quot;intendente&quot; is the name given to the person in charge of general maintenance of common spaces.

===Chile===
Chile is administratively divided in 16 regions. Between 1976 (1974 in some regions) and 2021, each region was headed by an intendant, appointed by the president.

===Cuba===
In Cuba, the intendant was introduced by the Constitution of the Republic (2019) to head the Administrative Councils - subordinate to the Municipal Assemblies of People&#x27;s Power (town halls) - and with strictly executive-administrative functions. As the highest local authority is the President of the Municipal Assembly (mayor), it is up to him to designate and remove the intendant, after agreement with the majority of the Delegates of People&#x27;s Power (councilors).

===Paraguay===
The Republic of Paraguay is administratively divided into 17 &quot;departamentos&quot; (departments), each of which is headed by an &quot;gobernador departamental&quot; (departmental governor). These &quot;departamentos&quot; are divided into 261 &quot;distritos&quot; (districts) (plus the capital district), districts are headed by an &quot;intendente municipal&quot; (municipal intendant), these intendants are popularly elected, and serve a term of five years.

===Uruguay===
Uruguay is divided administratively into 19 &quot;departamentos&quot; (departments). The executive power of each department is the &quot;intendencia&quot; (intendancy), headed by an &quot;intendente departamental&quot; (departmental intendant). The intendants are popularly elected, and serve a term of five years.

==Russia and Soviet Union==
The position of intendant was part of the tsarist Russian army from 1812 to 1868; intendants were responsible for supplies, finances, etc. in the field. After the 1935 rank reform that established &#x27;personal ranks&#x27; in the Soviet military, it was reintroduced as the rank title for administrative and supply officers. The specific ranks, their collar insignia, and their line equivalents were:
*&quot;technician-intendant second class&quot;, two rectangles, lieutenant
*&quot;technician-intendant first class&quot;, three rectangles, senior lieutenant
*&quot;intendant third class&quot;, one rectangle, captain
*&quot;intendant second class&quot;, two rectangles, major
*&quot;intendant first class&quot;, three rectangles, colonel.
*&quot;brigindendant&quot; (i.e., brigade intendant), one diamond, kombrig (brigade commander)
*&quot;divintendant&quot; (i.e., division intendant), two diamonds, komdiv (division commander)
*&quot;korindendant&quot; (i.e., corps intendant), three diamonds, komkor (corps commander)
*&quot;armintendant&quot; (i.e., army intendant), four diamonds, komandarm (army commander) second class.

On 7 May 1940, the rank title system for all Soviet Army senior officers was changed to bring it closer in line with standard European practice, and the ranks of major general of the intendant service, lieutenant general of the intendant service, and colonel general of the intendant service were introduced. Senior officers from brigintendant to armintendant rank underwent a re-attestation process and were given a general rank.

On 30 March 1942, the &#x27;intendant&#x27; ranks equivalent to those between lieutenant and colonel were abolished, and officers holding those ranks also underwent a re-attestation process and received ranks ranging from lieutenant of the intendant service to colonel of the administrative service.

==Scotland==
In Scotland intendant is an archaic title meaning &quot;supervisor&quot; or &quot;curator&quot;. The senior officer of the City of Glasgow Police was called an Intendant in the document establishing the force in 1800.

==United States==
For much of its history, the chief magistrate of the city of Charleston, South Carolina was the Intendant of the City, roughly corresponding to a mayor. The title Intendant was also used in other Lowcountry towns, where the office was assisted by &quot;wardens,&quot; a system which may have derived from earlier ecclesiastical administration under colonial rule.

==Other uses==
It is also commonly found today in many theaters and opera houses in Europe, where it is the equivalent to the title of general director, given to an individual in a managerial position, generally having control over all aspects of the company.

In &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Intendant was a title in the mirror universe. The mirror universe version of Kira Nerys held the position of &quot;Intendant of Bajor&quot;.

<text>The Medjool date ( - tamar al-majhūl. Tamar means &#x27;date&#x27; and majhūl means &#x27;unknown&#x27;, from &quot;jahila&quot;, &#x27;to not know&#x27;) also known as Medjoul, Mejhoul or Majhool, is a large, sweet cultivated variety of date (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;). It is an important commercial variety constituting some 25% of worldwide trade in dates.

== Landrace ==

The Medjool cultivar originates from the Tafilalt region of Morocco, where it is still grown. Outside Morocco, it is grown in the United States, Israel, Palestine, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Jordan. The variety is planted both for its fruit and for landscaping. 

The medjool is a distinct landrace, described as producing &quot;large soft fruit, with orange-yellowish flesh, and a mildly rich and pleasing flavor&quot;. Being large, soft, and with a &quot;caramel, honey&quot; flavor, the variety has been called &quot;the king of dates&quot;.

==Constituents ==

Medjool dates are high in oxalates (18–233 mg/100 g dry weight). 

Out of the over 3000 known cultivars, only two contain the disaccharide sugar sucrose: Deglet Nour and Medjool. All the rest contain the monosaccharides glucose and fructose in a mix known as invert sugar. Sucrose tastes sweeter than glucose but less sweet than fructose; the mix is less sweet than pure fructose, but still is somewhat sweeter than sucrose.

== Trade ==
In 2013, Israel held more than 60 percent of the global medjool market share. In 2024, Medjool constituted 25% of the world export market for dates. Those supplied to France, the largest European importer of dates, are predominantly from Algeria and Tunisia. Retail brands in both France and Italy often label the cultivar, usually Medjool or Deglet Nour, on the packet. Especially large Medjool dates are sold as a luxury product, for example in the Netherlands. A UK social enterprise, Zaytoun, sells Medjool dates from Palestine.
