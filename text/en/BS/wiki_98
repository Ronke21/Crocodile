<doc id="561179" wikidata="Q161803" url="?curid=561179" title="Postal codes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein">
<text>On 26 June 1964, Swiss Post introduced postal codes as the third country after Germany (1941) and the United States (1963).

In Switzerland, the postal codes have four digits. As with the postcode system introduced in Germany in 1993, a municipality can receive several postcodes. A locality (settlement) having its own postal code does not mean that it is an independent political municipality, but only that it is an official locality. In addition, a postcode can include several political communes (e.g.: 3048 Worblaufen, includes parts of the communes of Bern and Ittigen) or several cantons (e.g.: 8866 Ziegelbrücke, includes parts of the cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen), which is why it is not possible to assign it unambiguously in both directions. In addition, it is often not possible to assign a unique postcode to post offices (post boxes) in larger cities. For this reason, six-digit postcodes are used internally.

The Principality of Liechtenstein is also included in the Swiss postal code system, as is the German enclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein, which has its own Swiss postal codes in addition to its national one, DE-78266. Before January 2020, the Italian enclave of Campione d&#x27;Italia also had a Swiss postcode, CH-6911, but this ceased to be valid, and all mail requires the use of the Italian postcode IT-22061. This followed the enclave&#x27;s entry into the European Union&#x27;s Customs Area. Also in Italy, Swiss Post previously held an office in Domodossola with the code CH-3907. This is now used for the village of Simplon.

==Format of postal codes (PLZ/NPA)==
The Swiss postal codes are assigned geographically, from west to east. They do not follow political divisions (cantons, districts), but they follow a &quot;routing&quot; allocation, following railways and PostBus routes. The postal code of big cities finish with 00, and it is not allocated if in the region there is not a big center.

Switzerland is divided into nine postal districts, numbered from west to east. Each district is subdivided into postal areas.
Each area contains a maximum of one hundred units.

The postal codes are made up as follows:
:3436 Zollbrück
:3 = district (Bern)
:34 = area (Burgdorf)
:343 = route (Burgdorf - Langnau)
:3436 = post office number (Zollbrück)

Today, the third digit has no real meaning anymore. In the past, mail was assigned to fixed railway or truck routes, but modern logistics do not need this practice any more.

Postal codes of Liechtenstein are included in the same structure, using the range from 9480 to 9499.

<text>Buck Henry (born Henry Zuckerman; December 9, 1930 – January 8, 2020) was an American actor, screenwriter, and director. Henry&#x27;s contributions to film included his work as a co-writer for Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967) for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He also appeared in Nichols&#x27; &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), which he co-wrote with Nichols. Herbert Ross&#x27; &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), and Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972). In 1978, he co-directed &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978) with Warren Beatty receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. He later appeared in Albert Brooks&#x27; &quot;Defending Your Life&quot; (1991), and the Robert Altman films &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) and &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993).

His long career began on television with work on shows with Steve Allen in &quot;The New Steve Allen Show&quot; (1961). He co-created &quot;Get Smart&quot; (1965–1970) with Mel Brooks for which he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. He also served as a 10-time host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) and was the inaugural member of the show&#x27;s Five Timer&#x27;s Club, a humorous designation used to denote people who have hosted at least five episodes of &quot;SNL&quot;. He later guest-starred in such popular shows as &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, and &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

== Early life ==
Henry was born on December 9, 1930, in New York City, as Henry Zuckerman. His mother was Ruth Taylor (January 13, 1905 – April 12, 1984), a silent film actress, star of the original version of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, and his father was Paul Steinberg Zuckerman (April 15, 1899 – December 3, 1965), an Air Force brigadier general and stockbroker. Though the young Zuckerman was nicknamed &#x27;Buck&#x27; from childhood, he did not officially change his name to &quot;Buck Henry&quot; until the 1970s; both his birth name and nickname came from his grandfather. 

Henry attended The Choate School, at the time an all-boys institution (now Choate Rosemary Hall). At 15 years old, he made his professional acting debut in a Broadway production of &quot;Life with Father&quot;, which later toured theaters in Brooklyn, Long Island, and the Bronx. Henry earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature and a senior fellowship in writing at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he wrote for the university humor magazine, the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern,&quot; and met movie director Bob Rafelson.

Following graduation, he enlisted in the Army during the Korean War. He served in West Germany first as a helicopter mechanic and then transferred to Special Services, where he toured with the Seventh Army Repertory Company, performing in a play he both wrote and directed.

==Career==
=== Acting and writing ===
Henry joined the improvisational comedy group the Premise, whose ranks included George Segal and Theodore J. Flicker, performing in the West Village in Manhattan. This helped lead him into a television career.

From 1959 to 1962, as part of an elaborate hoax by comedian Alan Abel, he made public appearances as G. Clifford Prout, the quietly outraged president of the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals, who presented his point of view on talk shows. The character of Prout wished to clothe all animals in order to prevent their &#x27;indecency&#x27;, using slogans such as &quot;A nude horse is a rude horse&quot;. Henry played the character with deadpan sincerity. He was often presented as an eccentric, but was otherwise taken seriously by the broadcasters who interviewed him. &quot;Prout&quot; received many letters of support from TV viewers, and even some unsolicited monetary donations, all of which were invariably returned, as neither Henry nor Abel (who had no intention of following through on the Society&#x27;s stated aims) wanted to be accused of raising money fraudulently.

Henry became a cast member on &quot;The New Steve Allen Show&quot; (1961) and the US version of &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; (1964–1965).

He was a co-creator and writer for the secret agent comedy television series &quot;Get Smart&quot; (1965–1970), with comedian Mel Brooks. The show lasted for five seasons and 138 episodes and won numerous Emmy Awards. Two TV projects created by Henry had short runs: &quot;Captain Nice&quot; (1967) with William Daniels as a reluctant superhero, and &quot;Quark&quot; (1978), with Richard Benjamin in command of a garbage scow in outer space.

Henry shared an Oscar nomination with Calder Willingham for their screenplay for &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), in which he also appeared in a supporting role as a hotel desk clerk. Henry&#x27;s cameo in &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) had him (playing himself) pitching a 25-years-later sequel to &quot;The Graduate&quot;, which Henry later claimed led to real-life interest in such a project from some studios.

His many other screen writing credits included the sex farce &quot;Candy&quot; (1968), the romantic comedies &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970) and &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972), the satire &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), the thriller &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973), the comedy &quot;Protocol&quot; (1984), and the dark crime dramedy &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995). In several of these, such as &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;Catch-22&quot;, he also appeared as an actor. In 1997, Henry was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Distinguished Screenwriter Award.

Overall he appeared in more than 40 films, including a lead role in &quot;Taking Off&quot; (1971) and supporting roles in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976), &quot;Gloria&quot; (1980), &quot;Eating Raoul&quot; (1982), &quot;Aria&quot; (1987), &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot; (1990), &quot;Defending Your Life&quot; (1991), &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), and &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993).

He co-directed &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), the remake of &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, with the movie&#x27;s star Warren Beatty and appeared in the film as an officious angel, reprising the character originally played by Edward Everett Horton. Henry received a second shared Oscar nomination, this time for Best Director.

Later in his career, Henry became known for guest-starring and recurring roles on television. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (&quot;My Dinner With Einstein&quot;, 1989) as Dr. Victor Rudman, a fractal scientist who dated Murphy. He appeared on the television show &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in 2005. In 2007, he made two guest appearances on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as a contributor, billed as the show&#x27;s &quot;Senior Senior Correspondent&quot;. He has also appeared as Liz Lemon&#x27;s father, Dick Lemon, in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episodes &quot;Ludachristmas&quot; (December 13, 2007) and &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Intermission&quot; (November 4, 2010). In 2011, he appeared in a multi-episode arc of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Elka&#x27;s groom.

His Broadway credits included the 2002 revival of &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot;. Off-Broadway in July 2009, he starred opposite Holland Taylor in &quot;Mother&quot;, a play by Lisa Ebersole.

=== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===
Henry hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ten times between 1976 and 1980, making him the show&#x27;s most frequent host during its initial five-year run and on November 19, 1977, Henry became the first to host five times. It became a tradition during these years for Henry to host the final show of each season, beginning with the 1976–1977 season. Henry&#x27;s frequent host record was broken when Steve Martin made his 11th appearance as host of the show on the finale episode of the 1988–1989 season. During the episode of October 30, 1976, Henry was injured in the forehead by John Belushi&#x27;s katana in the samurai sketch. Henry&#x27;s head began to bleed and he was forced to wear a large bandage on his forehead for the rest of the show. As a gag, the members of the &quot;SNL&quot; cast each wore a bandage on their foreheads as well.

<text>Gerardo Murillo Coronado, also known by his signature &quot;Dr. Atl&quot; (October 3, 1875 – August 15, 1964), was a Mexican painter, writer and intellectual. He is most famous for his works inspired by the Mexican landscape, particularly volcanoes, and for being one of the early figures of modern Mexican art. 

Dr. Atl was a key figure in the development of Mexican muralism in the early 20th century, alongside artists like Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. His painting style was heavily influenced by the romanticism of the natural world, focusing on depicting Mexico&#x27;s volcanic and montainous terrain. 

In addition to his work as a painter, Dr. Atl was a strong advocate for the cultural and political identity of Mexico, emphasizing the importance of indigenous roots and the country&#x27;s natural beauty. He was a prominent intellectual figure and made contributions to the Mexican artistic and political spheres during the early 20th century.

Dr. Atl was also known for his contributions to the development of modern Mexican art education, as well as his writing. His legacy as an artist and cultural figure remains significant in Mexican art history.

==Biography==

Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, he began studying painting at an early age, under Felipe Castro. At 21, Murillo entered the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City to further his studies.

After demonstrating his talent, Murillo was awarded a grant in 1897 by the government of Porfirio Díaz to study painting in Europe. There he broadened his scope of learning, with study of philosophy and law at the University of Rome, and many trips to Paris to hear lectures on art given by Henri Bergson. His strong interest in politics led him to collaborate with the Socialist Party in Italy and work in the &quot;Avanti&quot; newspaper. In 1902 during a trip to Paris he took the signature name &quot;Atl&quot; (the Nahuatl word for &quot;water&quot;); Leopoldo Lugones added the &quot;Dr.&quot; to it.

Dr. Atl became very active in Mexico when he returned. In 1906 he participated with Diego Rivera, Francisco de la Torre, Rafael Ponce de León and others in an exhibition sponsored by Alonso Cravioto and Luis Castillo Ledon, the editors of the magazine &quot;Savia Moderna&quot;.

In 1906, Dr. Atl issued a manifesto calling for the development of a monumental public art movement in Mexico linked to the lives and interests of the Mexican people, a precursor of the Mexican Mural Movement launched in 1922. He was also commissioned by the Díaz government to design a glass curtain for the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) under construction in Mexico City, which was executed by Tiffany&#x27;s of New York. The curtain featured the two volcanoes overlooking the capital. He was also commissioned to paint a mural, which was postponed by the eruption of the Mexican Revolution against Porfirio Díaz in 1910.

In 1911, Dr. Atl returned to Europe. In Paris, he founded a journal and wrote about the social and political issues of Mexico, and criticized General Victoriano Huerta, who had helped overthrow the democratically elected government of Francisco I. Madero. Dr. Atl supported the Constitutionalist faction in the Mexican Revolution, leaning towards &quot;biblical socialism&quot; and promoting the growth of art, literature, and science. When he returned from Europe, he joined the Constitutionalist forces led by Venustiano Carranza,
and was appointed Director of the Academy of San Carlos. During the Revolution, he persuaded two young art students, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, to join the Carrancistas and illustrated &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, the carrancista official paper.
The winning faction of the Revolution rejected the Euro-centric emphasis of the Mexican government in the 19th and early 20th century and following the Revolution, there was a revival of interest in Mexico&#x27;s rich indigenous past and the popular arts, including folk dance, music, arts and crafts. Dr. Atl and other artists arranged exhibits of the folk arts and performances of popular dance and music and Dr. Atl prepared a two-volume study, &quot;Folk Arts in Mexico&quot;, published by the Mexican government in 1922.

He had ties to the socialist and anarchosyndicalist labor organization, the Casa del Obrero Mundial &quot;House of the World Worker.&quot; During the 1930s and 1940s, Dr. Atl published frequent articles praising European fascism, especially Adolf Hitler. His interest in politics seemed to wane as he became more interested in the field of volcanology.
Dr. Atl&#x27;s strong love of the outdoors and his active nature are seen in his many paintings which portray the landscapes of his era. Among his interests was the study of volcanoes, and he spent much time visiting both Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl. At one time, hespent two years living on the mountainside of the Popocatépetl. In his 1950 book, &quot;Cómo nace y crece un volcán, el Paricutín&quot; (&quot;How a Volcano is Born and Grows – Paricutín&quot;), he told of his experience of witnessing the eruption of Paricutín in 1943. He was injured while observing the eruption and his leg was amputated. Besides painting volcanic landscapes, he was considered an expert volcanologist and his papers were valuable to understanding volcanos.

Dr. Atl was also an artistic an literary critic, and for a while head of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura (National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature).

He gave the Nahuatl name &quot;Nahui Olin&quot; (a symbol of Aztec renewal meaning &quot;four movement,&quot; the symbol of earthquakes) to Carmen Mondragón (1893–1978), a Mexican poet and painter with whom he established a very intense love relationship.

The artist received numerous awards for his literature and art, including the Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor, in 1956, and the National Prize for Arts in 1958.

Dr. Atl died in Mexico City in 1964 and is buried in Panteon Civil de Dolores cemetery in the capital, in the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons, an honor bestowed upon him for his contributions to the cultural field.

==As a writer==
Dr. Atl wrote essays, scientific works, criticisms and short stories.

His first book from 1913, was &quot;Les volcans du Mexique&quot;. A two-volume study, &quot;Folk Arts in Mexico&quot;, published by the Mexican government in 1922.

&quot;Cuentos bárbaros&quot; was published in 1930. In that same year &quot;Gentes profanas en el convento&quot; was also published.

&quot;Cuentos de todos los colores&quot; (&quot;Stories of All Colors&quot;) published in 1933, 1936 and 1941, which focuses on the themes of the Mexican Revolution and has been hailed as one of the best narrations of that historical period.

His book &quot;La Perla&quot; (&quot;The Pearl&quot;) inspired the writing of the novella, much the same, by John Steinbeck.

In 1950 his book &quot;Cómo nace y crece un volcán. El Paricutín&quot; (&quot;How a Volcano is Born and Grows, the Paricutín&quot;), which describes how of a volcano was being formed within a few months, was published.

==Tribute==

A statue of Dr. Atl was erected in the &#x27;Roundabout of the Illustrious Jaliscienses&#x27;, in Guadalajara, as a tribute to the artist.

In 1961, &quot;Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond&quot; aired an episode based on an experience of Dr. Atl in 1920. The plot description states: &quot;On the run from the authorities, Atl (played by David J. Stewart) takes refuge in a convent that is allegedly haunted by the ghost of an Aztec warrior. Of course, Atl is too intelligent a man to believe in such nonsense—until the &quot;Federale&quot; who is pursuing him is mysteriously strangled to death. The real Dr. Atl makes a guest appearance in the closing scene.&quot;

Four chapters of Rebecca West&#x27;s book &quot;Survivors in Mexico&quot; deal with the life of Dr. Atl.

On October 3, 2017, Google celebrated his 142nd birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Edward Gawler Prior, (21 May 1853 – 12 December 1920) was a mining engineer and politician in British Columbia.

==Early life==
Prior was born in Dallowgill, Yorkshire, England, and worked as a mining engineer in England until 1873. He then moved to British Columbia, settling in Nanaimo and took employment as assistant manager of the Vancouver Coal Mining &amp; Land Co., Ltd. In 1878 he resigned and was appointed Inspector of Mines for the British Columbia government. He left that position and went into business as an iron and hardware merchant in 1880.

==Political career==
Prior was first elected to the provincial legislature in 1886. In 1888, Prior won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative. From December 1895 to July 1896 and 1897 Prior served as Controller of Inland Revenue in the cabinets of Prime Minister Sir Mackenzie Bowell and his successor Sir Charles Tupper.

He lost his seat in 1901 due to violations of election rules. He moved to provincial politics and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1902 becoming minister of mines. In 1902 he became the 15th premier leading the province&#x27;s last non-partisan administration but was dismissed by the lieutenant governor in 1903 due to charges of conflict of interest that involved giving an important construction contract to his own hardware business, and did not run in the subsequent 1903 general election. He was defeated in 1904 in an attempt to return to the federal House of Commons.

Prior was appointed the 11th lieutenant governor of British Columbia in 1919 but became ill and died in office within a year of his appointment. Edward Gawler Prior is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

Prior was the last Canadian premier to be dismissed by a lieutenant-governor, (though William Aberhart, Premier of Alberta, was nearly so in 1937).

<text>Ahri&#x27;ahn (more commonly referred to as Arion) is a fictional sword and sorcery superhero published by American company DC Comics. He debuted in &quot;Warlord&quot; (vol. 1) #55 (March 1982), and was created by Paul Kupperberg and Jan Duursema. A powerful, immortal wizard from ancient Atlantis centuries before it sunk, the character originally starred in his own series taking place outside the main continuity of DC Comics. After appearing in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the character&#x27;s history was adopted into the Aquaman version of Atlantis, revised to be a demigod serving as a member of the fictional group of cosmic entities known as the Lords of Order. The character&#x27;s magical and scientific exploits and heroism in the fictional mythology of Atlantis makes him both a reverred figure and the cultural progenitor of the &quot;Homo magi&quot; race and their descendants, the Atlanteans. Depending on continuities, he also serves as an ancestor to various characters in the DC Universe, including Zatanna, Aquaman, and Ocean Master.

Arion appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by David Kaye.

== Creation ==
In 1978, while working for Charlton Comics, Paul Kupperberg created a proposal for an ongoing series entitled Atlantis, the series was based on Plato&#x27;s metaphorical concept of Atlantis, Kupperberg stated &quot;I really tried to make my version of Atlantis as close to his idea as I could, although I changed plenty&quot; when developing the plot of the series Kupperberg drew inspiration from Larry Niven&#x27;s The Magic Goes Away stating &quot;When I steal I steal from the best&quot;. the proposal laid dormant until editor Laurie Sutton was looking for a new backup feature for Warlord. when artist Jan Duursema got involved she suggested changing the hero&#x27;s name of Tynan to Arion, Kupperburg commented on the name change &quot;Tynan sucked! it was always intended to be a placeholder name&quot;

==Publication history==
Arion began as a back-up feature in the DC Comics book &quot;Warlord&quot; with issue #55, in which ran until issue #62 when Arion gained his own series, &quot;Arion Lord of Atlantis&quot;, beginning with #1 (November 1982). The series lasted for 35 issues plus a special which wrapped up the original storyline, running from November 1982 to September 1985 with the special shipping in November 1985. Concurrently between April 1985 - March 1986, Arion was one of the many characters involved in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover title, with his history of Atlantis inserted into the main DC continuity. Arion also appeared in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; in a crossover with Superman.

Years later in 1991, Kupperburg sent in a proposal for what would eventually be &quot;Arion the IMMORTAL&quot;, a sequel to his original series. Originally titled &quot;Arion: Darkworld&quot; and &quot;Arion, Lord of Order&quot;, due to elements similar to characters presented in &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; and &quot;Sandman&quot; titles, the draft was reworked as to make the characters involved in the book independent of the same Lords of Chaos and Order concept of magic different from the framework established in two DC Comic titles as to not interfere with their direction and depiction. In 1992, Arion starred in a miniseries that established him in the modern era. He would also make appearances in several &quot;Aquaman&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot; crossovers.

=== Modern stories ===
During the early 2000s, despite the efforts to ensure the characters and concepts in the series were dissimilar to both titles, many references books and encyclopedias later connected Arion&#x27;s character, supporting cast, and villains to the same Lords of Chaos and Order characters referenced in other titles. Arion&#x27;s character would play a role in the &quot;JSA&quot; title, where the character is involved in a conflict connected to the other characters involved in Lords of Order and Chaos and is killed off in the fiftieth issue of the series. Despite the character&#x27;s death, a past version of the character hailing from the 1600s would appear in 2006 in the &quot;Camelot Falls&quot; storyline in the &quot;Superman&quot; title and is depicted as an antagonist to the story. Concurrently, a new incarnation of Arion appeared whose real name was William Knightly.

==== New 52 &amp; Rebirth-onward ====
Eventually, a new version of the character was introduced in the &quot;Secret Six&quot; 2014 run by Gail Simone; while making a silhouetted appearance, the character&#x27;s children, Uvian and his unnamed sons, formed a cult known as the Children of Arion and appeared in one of the main antagonists in the Gauntlet storyline in the series. The character would eventually make a full appearance in the &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series, acting as the main antagonist. The book connects Blue Beetle&#x27;s mythos with other magical characters and concepts such as Arion and implies his scarab Khaji Da to be magical in nature.

==Fictional character biography==

=== Origin ===
In Arion&#x27;s original origin told to him by Calculha, Arion was a cosmic being born from energies coalesced into form. Because of his standing as a cosmic being, he is capable of affecting the balance between both order and chaos and because of that, is chosen as an unwitting agent. He is found by his aged mentor and Sorcerer Supreme, Calculha, and is tutored in the art of magic and spell-casting. Through their training, they form a familial bond.

In his revised origin, elements from the former remain with some changes; Arion (referred to then as &quot;Ahri&#x27;ahn&quot;) is the son of deities Calculha and Majistra, the former Sorcerer Supreme and the latter his equal with a connection to Egyptians as well as the younger twin brother of Garn Daanuth. Due to the couple&#x27;s differences in alignment from embodying light and darkness respectively, the pair separate and the two brothers are unaware of their connection until later in life. A prophesized hero, Calculha trained Ahri&#x27;ahn in white magic in preparation for his destiny. When near of age, he meets Majistra and Garn during a conclave with other wizards and the family later battles for supremacy when Majistra plots to empower herself with the Zodiac Crystals, artifacts of great magical power, to usher in a age of dark magic. While she manages to gain the upper hand with Calculha, Arion&#x27;s intervention and sacrifice of usurping control of the crystals displaced her, mystically seared Garn&#x27;s skin, granting him an albino-esque appearance, and also displaces Calculha when he tries to save his son from magically disintegrating. He sets his converted body into a star and his soul to the Darkworld dimension to be recalled at a later time although the family feud tiled the Earth&#x27;s axis slightly, inadvertently causing an Ice Age. Ahri&#x27;ahn&#x27;s soul is later recalled thanks to blinded warrior Wyynde&#x27;s 10,000 years later after guided by Calculha&#x27;s spirit, christened &quot;Arion&quot;, a corruption of his name. He is taken to Atlantis and is made Lord High Mage for the King of Atlantis, D&#x27;Tilluh. Eventually, he is re-taught magic he had forgotten by Calculha and becomes one of Atlantis&#x27;s foremost protectors, aided by Wyynde, Atlantean lieutenant guardsman, and Lady Chian, Captain of D&#x27;Tilluh&#x27;s royal guard and lover.

Later additions to his origin expand on the time in which his soul existed in a state of intangibility in Darkworld as he was raised by sorceress Jheryl and befriended the Imp, Ghy. Also teaching him magic, she created the red gemstone he uses and serves as his motherly figure in place of Majistra. When called back to the land of the living by his father, the sudden departure from one realm to another blocked his memory of his time in the Darkworld. Owing to its unique regard to time, only twenty years passed in the realm while 100,000 years passed on Earth.

==== &quot;Arion, Lord of Atlantis&quot; (1982-1985) ====
Throughout his life as Lord High Mage, Arion would have many adventures; he would encounter and be pitted against various gods of the Atlantean pantheon, ended the Ice Age at the cost of his own magical power, and sought ways to reclaim his former might. He would also encounter Garn and learn of their true connections as well as gain a new ally: Mara. Eventually, Arion defeated Garn by sealing him away in Darkworld. Arion would also reclaim his magical power when he was lured into Darkworld by his mother in a plot to gain more power through a connection to Darkworld like its respective denizens. With his soul re-worked by the deity known only as the Weaver, Arion gains his former might but is unable to stop the destruction of Atlantis when Chaon, one of the Atlantean dark gods, led an alien race (later revealed to be descendants of Atlanteans that ventured into space) against Atlantis and sunk it himself. With the empire fractured, the remaining Atlanteans venture to other corners of the globe to rebuild.

==== &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; ====

Arion would appear in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earth&quot; crossover as being among the heroes taken in by Harbinger and aids the heroes.

=== Post-Crisis ===
Owing to the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Arion&#x27;s universe now exists in the same DC Multiverse with a few changes; Arion&#x27;s version of Atlantis took place in the distant past, roughly around 500,000 years before the main DCU timeline and is explained that despite Arion&#x27;s belief, Atlantis as a whole wasn&#x27;t destroyed. He was also made part of Power Girl&#x27;s backstory, being his great-granddaughter jettisoned into the future, her powers said to originate from Arion&#x27;s experimentation in genetic manipulation and an ancestor of Zatanna Zatara through her mother&#x27;s side. Eventually, Arion and characters from within his series would be connected to DC&#x27;s &quot;homo magi&quot; and the Lords of Chaos and Order, the aforementioned sorcerer being among the Lords of Order. Affiliated characters, like his father and mother, would also be retconned into being deities themselves, making him an actual being of divine origin.Later, an aged Arion is revealed to be immortal and to have lost his magic and is living in Greenwich Village along with several former Atlantean gods and goddesses, including Chaon, Deedra, Gemimn, and the Weaver. His companion, Mara, was trapped in canine form when the magic was lost. Arion renews his old rivalry with his brother, Garn Daanuth, and works to stop the return of Atlantean magic by preventing Darkworld, revealed to be a sentient being, from slumbering. 

In the &quot;Time Masters&quot; mini-series, Rip Hunter and his allies travel back in time to Atlantis where Arion assists them while trying to convince Hunter to not use violence.

After &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, Arion aided the Justice League of America against Scarabus. He eventually turned up in the present day, where his body was taken over by Mordru and his spirit imprisoned in Gemworld. His spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by Power Girl and Hawkgirl (along with a recently awakened Dove) to weaken Mordru. Before his soul departed, Arion revealed to Power Girl that she was not his granddaughter and thus not an Atlantean.

Arion seemingly reappeared in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; as one of the mystics gathered in Atlantis to keep the Spectre at bay, and later in the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; tie-in special as one of several magical beings summoned to rebuild the Rock of Eternity. It was later revealed that this Arion was an imposter named Bill Knightley who used Arion&#x27;s reputation to bolster his own.

In the &quot;Camelot Falls&quot; Superman storyline, a past and depowered version of Arion appears from 1659 after learning of a cataclysmic future centered around the presence of Superman. Using vestiges of magical power from artifacts collected over the millennia, he time travels to the modern era and reveals to Superman and his friends his vision, believing that alien interference has a hand in creating apocalyptic situations for humanity in the long-term, and tells him to quit. When he refuses despite escalating present situations supporting his point, he actively opposes Superman and nearly discredits him. He also kidnaps a &quot;pretender&quot; to his name, William Knightley, to understand his fate in the modern era. He battles Superman once more, who eventually prevails due to Phantom Stranger&#x27;s protections but manages to slip back to his proper time by using Knightley as a decoy due to long-lasting disguise spells and Knightley possessing mystical powers. 

===The New 52 onward===
Although he did not make a full appearance, Arion would make a brief cameo and was mentioned in the 2014 &quot;Secret Six&quot; relaunch; it is revealed that millions of years ago, he was the wizard responsible for sealing away elder gods known as the &quot;Dark Giants&quot;, who appear to be both based on and a reference to Cthulhu Mythos deities and are the central antagonists that threaten the world in the modern-day from being released due to Black Alice&#x27;s condition of siphoning magic around the world, undoing the very seals that kept them in place. His children are also the antagonist as they work to help undo the seal, having formed a cult named the &quot;Children of Arion&quot;. The four members remain nameless save seemingly the leader, Uvian.

Following the company-wide rebranding in DC Rebirth, Arion is reintroduced in &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;. In this continuity, he shares similarities to his previous version such as being a former king of Atlantis and is stated to be a Lord of Order manifested in the physical form of an Atlantean demigod. He is also indirectly mentioned alongside his brother by the newer version of Calculha and Dark Majistra, this revised history making him an ancestor of Aquaman, Ocean Master, Atlan, and Atlanna.

In the &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; &quot;Hard Choices&quot; storyline, a villainous version of Arion appears. Thousands of years ago, Arion was believed to have been turned into an insane villain from exposure to the Blue Beetle scarab and gains a more demonic appearance from the usage of more malevolent magic. After being sealed away by Doctor Fate long ago, he uses his apprentice Mordecai Cull to lure Doctor Fate. Jaime Reyes, and the Blue Beetle scarab into undoing his sealing, stealing the scarab for himself to use its power to destroy the world. With the help of Doctor Fate and his allies, Jaime Reyes manages to defeat the sorcerer and his Atlantean demons created by his magic. Arion is then sealed in a crystal of absolution by Doctor Fate for 10,000 years.

Arion appears in several flashbacks in the &quot;Drowned Earth&quot; crossover. Within the story, Atlantis and Themyscria are revealed to have been allies in the past during his reign and is a highly regarded hero in their legends, being one of the few males to be held in such regard. Arion is also Poseidon&#x27;s protege, impressed with the younger sorcerer&#x27;s intelligence and rulership and reveals the existence of the Life Force. Using his skills, Arion creates the artifact, Clarion, and communes with life outside Earth to share the Life Force with planets lacking it. Selfishly not wanting to share his power and envious of Arion&#x27;s accomplishments, Poseidon lies and convinces Arion the alien gods he invited were conquerors. Believing Poseidon&#x27;s duplicity and feeling guilty, Arion inverts his own invention and the Life Force to create the Death Force and a instrument capable of killing the alien gods by co-singing them into the Graveyard of the Gods afterlife but seemingly at the cost of his own life. In the aftermath, the alien gods (known as the Triumvirate of Sea Gods or Ocean Lords) bore a grudge against the pair and would attack Atlantis and Aquaman thousands of years later and Poseidon&#x27;s actions and Arion&#x27;s fate inadvertently led to Atlantis&#x27; well known isolationist policies. However, Queen Mera, the ruling monarch of Atlantis, would also fulfill Arion&#x27;s intents by using the Clarion to broadcast her intentions of connecting her kingdom with interested, oceanic alien worlds. Unlike the Hard Choices storyline, the Drowned Earth crossover suggested Arion was insane through the Tear of Extinction instead of Khaji-Da. The 2021 edition of the &quot;DC Comics Encyclopedia&quot; addresses the discrepancy, stating that he was indeed driven insane although instead of dying as the story suggested, he disappeared for a millennia and his fall from grace due to the Tear of Extinction was covered up by Atlantean authorities by claiming he perished. The entry also expresses the chronological events that happened afterward, including the flashback and present accounts of the character in the &quot;Hard Choices&quot; storyline as well as suggesting the &quot;Camelot Falls&quot; storyline also took place.

In the 2018 &quot;Justice League&quot; backup issues of &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, the famous sorcerer of Arthurian legends, Merlin, plots to conquer all of the magic under his control. His quest pits him against Justice League Dark, Aquaman, and Atlantis&#x27;s Silent School. Wanting to control the extra-dimensional wellspring of Atlantean magic known as Darkworld without doing so personally, he uses his magical knowledge to resurrect Arion, who has a natural connection to Darkworld and puts him under mind control as one of his Sapphire Knights.

== Characterization ==

=== Historical and mythological figure ===
Ahri&#x27;ahn (simplied to Arion in the fictional Atlantean language) was originally depicted as the &quot;Lord High Mage&quot; during the times of ancient Atlantis, a senior government post held by sorcerers that makes him a designated expert in the mystic matters, a protector, and a leader in the Atlantean government that was only surpassed by the monarch and their aide. Although the continuities and histories of the character changes various details regarding his background, he is also commonly portrayed as a revered, influential figure and eventual monarch of Atlantis. More recent stories casts the character as a mythological figure in Atlantean history, in which Mera compares to the King Arthur legends on the &quot;surface&quot;.

=== Heritage and lineage ===
Both the &quot;Arion, Lord of Atlantis&quot; backup issues in Warlord early issue of the ongoing series of the same name first state the character to being a cosmic being created from magic energies with the power to influence chaos and order. A later issue retroactively changes Arion&#x27;s background, instead casting him as a demigod and the biracial son of gods Calcula and Majistra as well as the twin brother of Garn Daanuth. Prior to the New 52, the character was confirmed to be a distant ancestor of Zatanna from Sindella&#x27;s line. In the current continuity, the character is the ancestor of the Atlantean royal family, making him related to characters such as Aquaman, Ocean Master, Atlanna, and Andrina Curry.

=== Identities ===
Due to the character&#x27;s immortal lifetime, at times, he has adopted various identities and fabricated various backgrounds to hide his true nature as a Lord of Order and immortal sorcerer:

* In the 1600s, Arion was known as Vicomte Jean-Simon Giscard D&#x27;Arion, claiming to be son of a deceased noble and was known for his aristocratic tendencies, charisma, and distinctive accent which was considered foreign to residents of Paris. During that time period, Arion was depicted as being arrogant and pessimistic.
* In the modern age, Arion is known as Aristotle Ronalds, an elderly American resident in Greenwich Village. Unlike his past identity as Vicomte, Arion&#x27;s mystic abilities waned further enough to no longer maintain a youthful appearance until he regained his magical powers and resorted to scams to earn money. He also has a pet dog named Mara, who was an immortal &quot;Homo magi&quot; shapeshifter before becoming trapped as a dog after magic faded.

=== Reputation ===
The character is recognized as a Lord of Order and is remarked to be considered one of the most powerful sorcerers in the DC Universe due to his immortal lifetime and studies. He is among the few characters outside Doctor Fate and Zatanna whom has been referred as Sorcerer Supreme.

==== Garn Daanuth ====
Garn Daanuth is a fictional supervillain introduced in &quot;Warlord&quot; #62 (July 1982). His character is the major antagonist in both &quot;Arion, Lord of Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Arion the Immortal&quot; titles, serving as Arion&#x27;s arch-enemy. He is affiliated with the Lords of Chaos, originally stated to be one of their agents. Later and modern revisions of the character instead mention him as a genuine Lord of Chaos. In the DC Universe, he serves as a prominent evil figure in ancient Atlantis&#x27;s history and the former ruler of Mu, whose people culturally resemble ancient Egyptians. He is also alleged to be an ancestor of the Titans hero, Tempest (formerly Aqualad) and a distant relative to significant DC characters such as Aquaman, Ocean Master, and Zatanna through his brother&#x27;s bloodline.

==== Other ====
==Powers and abilities==
Being among the Lords of Order whom possess a human form, his demigod heritage and studies over the centuries makes him a powerful sorcerer. He is classified as an archmage, a designation that suggests he himself is an enchanted being or a higher-dimensional entity. Arion utilizes a distinctive form of magic known as &quot;Atlantean magic&quot;, originating from a connection to the extradimensional realm known as Darkworld and differs from other magical practices in the DC Universe such as those practiced by Doctor Fate. At the height of his power, Arion&#x27;s abilities were considered nearly limitless and possesses a wide array of powers, including the capacity to alter his size, cast illusions, and even unleash devastating natural disasters.

Alongside his extraordinary magical abilities, Arion possesses heightened senses, psychic abilities, and the gift of prophecy, enabling him to perceive disturbances in both the present and the future. Though he favors magical solutions, Arion is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman. His versatility extends beyond magic, as he is even adept in the art of three-card monte. After The New 52 reboot, the character was also retroactively established as a technological and scientific genius responsible for the advanced technology that Atlantis possess.

=== Artifacts, technology, and resources ===
Arion is also classified as a sorcerer, a class of magic users who uses enchanted objects to enhance their abilities and safeguard themselves from the inherent costs and perils of magic. This classification is especially relevant to instances the character is depowered or has relinquished a significant portion of his powers. Among his arsenal of mystic artifacts includes the Mantle of the Savior, the robes he often wears weaved by his father with mystical threads. Most notably, the Mystic Gem of Ahri&#x27;ahn is the magic crystal often on his chest, powering his magic by converting solar energy into magical energy and can also draw power from Darkworld. Arion also uses Calculha&#x27;s magic crystals, shattered pieces of a magical crystal ball containing a portion of his divine father&#x27;s power. These crystals serve as a finite source of magic due to a limited supply, requiring him to use them only in emergencies. At some point, Arion also used the Staff of Arion, a conduit of Atlantean magic he can summon at will. The staff is also owned by Traci 13.

Arion also possess a vast amount of resources; Arion&#x27;s base of operations is the Citadel of Sorcery, an inheritance from his father. This large structure, decorated with Atlantean and Egyptian-like designs, acts as a sanctum and possesses a large collection of knowledge and artifacts, some which predate Arion, and is a source of magical power which can awaken other&#x27;s abilities. Among Arion&#x27;s most renown technological creation is the Tear of Extinction, a fusion of magic and technology that takes the form of a liquid substance infused with the &quot;Death Force&quot; a cosmic force capable of killing even the divine and sends them to a form of the afterlife known as the Graveyard of the Gods but usage of it can drive the user insane.

== Other versions ==
=== William Knightley ===
William &quot;Bill&quot; Knightley is a sorcerous hero from Ohio whom took the name and inspiration from Ahri&#x27;ahn himself, hoping to use his name (&quot;Arion&quot;) to help jumpstart his superhero career and had an opportunity in the form of the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; event, being one of the many heroes to help fight off an insane Spectre. Finding it difficult, he would meet his predecessor&#x27;s past self, who views him as an imitator and fraud trading in on his name, and would punish him for it despite Bill&#x27;s stating he was considered dead in the present time and plea to be his advisor. Ahri&#x27;ahn would later use Bill as a stand-in for him to be arrested by Superman in his place due to having coming into conflict with the hero and world governments, using a long lasting disguise spell and his actual sorcerous abilities to have him masquerade as himself. Despite Ahri&#x27;ahn and his insistence on Bill being an imitator, the magical community is unaware and believes William to be Arion himself. Furthermore, the character&#x27;s ability to replicate his specific brand of magic and mystical spells cast by Zatanna believing him to be Arion suggests a connection between Bill and Arion.

==In other media==
* Arion appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by David Kaye. This version was the grandson of Vandal Savage, the first king of Atlantis, an agent of the Lords of Order, and ancestor of the Atlanteans and Homo Magi whose magic was derived from his crown. After learning Vandal&#x27;s intention to sink Atlantis and further the Atlantean and Homo Magi, Arion died opposing him while Klarion the Witch Boy fulfilled Vandal&#x27;s plot. In the present, Vandal attempts to obtain Arion&#x27;s crown by creating a clone of him inhabited by Ocean Master&#x27;s mind, who is eventually killed by the Lords of Order.
* Arion appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<doc id="561191" wikidata="Q6941994" url="?curid=561191" title="Music of Andorra">
<text>The Principality of Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music in nearby regions of France and Spain, but is especially Catalan in character, especially in the presence of dances like the sardana. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la Vella and Saint Anne&#x27;s dance in Escaldes-Engordany.

Radio Nacional d’Andorra runs both Radio Andorra and the music station Andorra Música.

Music festivals in Andorra include the ChamJam Music Festival, Ordino and the jazz Escaldes-Engordany International Jazz Festival. Violinist Gérard Claret is the director of the Young National Orchestra of Cambra d&#x27;Andorra.

The national anthem of Andorra is &quot;El Gran Carlemany&quot; (&quot;Great Charlemagne&quot;). It was adopted on 8 September 1914, the feast day of Andorra&#x27;s patron saint, the Virgin of Meritxell. 

The progressive metal band Persefone is one of the most notable music groups to originate from Andorra.

==Eurovision==

Andorra (through national broadcaster RTVA) has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest on only six occasions, from 2004 until 2009. In 2004, Spaniard Marta Roure&#x27;s &quot;Jugarem A Estimar-Nos&quot; was the first Catalan language entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest, and Andorra remains the only participating country presenting songs in Catalan. Andorra did not progress beyond the semi-finals in any of its six attempts; its best result was in 2007, when punk band Anonymous and the song &quot;Salvem el món&quot; finished 12th among 28 countries in the semi-final. Andorra decided to withdraw from the 2010 edition due to lack of funding from the TV station&#x27;s shareholders and due to spending cuts within the network, and has not returned.

In 1983, Golijov emigrated to Israel, where he studied with Mark Kopytman at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem. Three years later, he studied with George Crumb at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree. In 1991, Golijov joined the faculty of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he was named Loyola Professor of Music in 2007. During the 2012–13 concert season, he occupied the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer&#x27;s Chair at Carnegie Hall.

As of 2016, Golijov lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.

Golijov is married to author Leah Hager Cohen. He was previously married to architect and designer Neri Oxman., and has three children with his first wife, Silvia, who is a Special Education teacher.

==Music career==
Golijov grew up listening to chamber music, Jewish liturgical and klezmer music, and the nuevo tango of Ástor Piazzolla. His &quot;Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind&quot; was inspired by the writings and teachings of Rabbi Yitzhak Saggi Nehor.

In 1996, his work &quot;Oceana&quot; was premiered at the Oregon Bach Festival. He composed &quot;La Pasión según San Marcos&quot; for the Passion 2000 project in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 2010, he composed &quot;Sidereus&quot; for a consortium of 35 American orchestras, to commemorate Galileo.

Golijov had a long working relationship with soprano Dawn Upshaw, who he called his muse. She premiered some of his works, often written specifically for her. These included &quot;Three Songs for Soprano and Orchestra&quot; and his popular opera, &quot;Ainadamar&quot;, which premiered at Tanglewood in 2003.

Starting in 2000, Golijov composed movie soundtracks for documentaries and other films, including &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot;, &quot;Youth Without Youth&quot;, &quot;Tetro&quot; and &quot;Twixt&quot;. He also composed and arranged chamber music, including for the Kronos Quartet (&quot;Nuevo&quot;) and the St. Lawrence String Quartet.

Golijov&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Falling Out of Time&quot; was inspired by a novel by Israeli author David Grossman.

Golijov composed the soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Megalopolis&quot; which he subsequently developed into a symphonic work premiered by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on November 8, 2024. Coppola was present at the world premier of this work.

==Controversies==

Golijov came under scrutiny in 2011 for a series of commissions that were either delayed or cancelled. A violin concerto written for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was not completed in time, Golijov missed a second deadline the following year in Berlin, and a third composition missed its January 2013 premiere at Disney Hall.

This followed a similar cancellation in 2010, when a scheduled song cycle had to be removed from the program when it was not completed in time. The March 2011 premiere of a new string quartet for the St. Lawrence Quartet was also postponed, though the work, &quot;Qohelet&quot;, was completed later that year and premiered by the quartet in October 2011.

Around 2006, the Metropolitan Opera commissioned Golijov to compose an opera, to be performed in the 2018–19 season. In 2016, the Met cancelled the commission because of the composer&#x27;s lack of progress.

Tom Manoff, a composer and critic, and Brian McWhorter, a trumpeter, alleged that Golijov&#x27;s &quot;Sidereus&quot; was largely copied from Michael Ward-Bergeman&#x27;s composition &quot;Barbeich&quot;. Alex Ross of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reviewed both scores and wrote, &quot;To put it bluntly, &#x27;Sidereus&#x27; is &#x27;Barbeich&#x27; with additional material attached.&quot; Ross added that Ward-Bergeman knew of and did not object to Golijov&#x27;s borrowings, having written, &quot;Osvaldo and I came to an agreement regarding the use of &#x27;Barbeich&#x27; for &#x27;Sidereus.&#x27; The terms were clearly understood, and we were both happy to agree. Osvaldo and I have been friends and collaborators for years. I don’t have anything else to say about the matter.&quot; A consortium of 35 orchestras had paid Golijov $75,000, supplemented by a $50,000 grant from the League of American Orchestras, to write a 20-minute work. The work that Golijov produced was only 9 minutes. Golijov had used that same musical material in his 2009 composition &quot;Radio&quot;.

Golijov responded to these questions by explaining that he composed the original musical material jointly with Ward-Bergeman for a film score which in the end did not include the material, and that he used it by agreement with Ward-Bergeman, who did not comment publicly on the matter. Golijov cited Monteverdi, Schubert and Mahler as other composers who used existing musical material to create new music.

<doc id="561208" wikidata="Q2347119" url="?curid=561208" title="Music of Belarus">
<text>Belarus is an Eastern European country with a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country&#x27;s folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The country&#x27;s musical traditions spread with its people to countries like Russia, Canada, United States, Kazakhstan and Latvia. The people of Belarus were exposed mostly to Russian pop music during this period and also after independence in 1991. In 2002, however, President Alexander Lukashenko has signed a decree requiring 50% of all FM broadcast music to be Belarusian in origin, and since 1 January 2005 the rule has been even stricter (75% of music broadcast each day must be Belarusian). However, it does not regulate the language of the songs, so most of the music which is broadcast is still in Russian.
Documentation of its music stretches back to at least the 15th century. Prior to that, skomorokhs were the major profession for musicians. A neumatic chant, called znamenny, from the word &#x27;znamia&#x27;, meaning sign or neume, used until the 16th century in Orthodox church music, followed by two hundreds of stylistic innovation that drew on the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation. In the 17th century, Partesnoe penie, part singing, became common for choruses, followed by private theaters established in cities like Minsk and Vitebsk.

== Prehistoric Times ==
The first musical instruments appeared in territories adjacent to Belarus as early as the Paleolithic era. Tools made from mammoth bones, showing marks of rhythmic strikes—considered by some researchers to be primitive musical instruments used to create rhythmic sounds during magical rituals associated with hunting—have been discovered near the villages of Mezin in the Chernihiv region, Horodok in the Rivne region, and Kostenki in the Voronezh region.

The earliest musical instruments on Belarusian territory were found at the Dubakray settlement near Lake Sennitsa, on the border of Vitsyebsk and Pskov regions. Two bone flutes discovered there were straight tubes with five sound holes. Excavations of the Neolithic settlement of Asavets (Beshankovichy district) uncovered a fragment of a reed pipe (zhaleyka) made from the bone of a small bird. These finds are dated to the 4th–3rd millennium BCE. Similar discoveries include whistles made from the leg bones of a stork at the Kamyen settlement (Pinsk district).

In the Bronze Age (3rd–early 1st millennium BCE), multibarreled flutes were already known. Some examples were found in monuments of the Lusatian culture, which was widespread in Poland and the southwestern regions of Belarus.

From the early Iron Age (7th century BCE–5th century CE), bone pipes and whistles have been found, such as those discovered at the Horani hillfort (Smorgon district). These instruments were carefully crafted, with both ends of the bones neatly cut at right angles and holes drilled along the sides. A similar pipe from the 12th–13th centuries was found in Slutsk.

The origins of Belarusian musical art can be traced back to the folk creativity of the Eastern Slavs. The first professional musicians included &quot;skomorokhi&quot; (wandering minstrels), instrumentalists (players of lyres, bagpipes, gusli, cymbals, violins, and others), as well as church and monastery musicians.

== Ancient Music ==
The development of ancient professional musical art in Belarus is closely linked to the Christianization process. This facilitated the assimilation of Byzantine spiritual music, influencing genres of church chants such as the antiphon, irmos, troparion, canon, and sticheron. These chants were performed in a monophonic, a cappella manner, and the accompanying musical terminology also reflected these influences. Church choral culture was indirectly shaped by folklore traditions, especially linguistic prosody, which later influenced secular music. Over time, the foundations of musical professionalism emerged. Original Old Belarusian chant forms were recorded using medieval neumatic notation in handwritten collections, predominantly monastic.

A connection with broader European folk traditions in the Middle Ages is evident in the activities of &quot;skamarochy&quot;—wandering professional performers whose art synthesized various forms. They were musicians (playing &quot;husli&quot;, bagpipes, recorders, drums, reed pipes, shawms, later violins, and cymbals), singers, acrobats, gymnasts, illusionists, and animal trainers who performed in town squares, villages, castles, taverns, and other venues. Notable among them were &quot;skamarochy-damračei&quot; (performers of historical songs and epics accompanied by the &quot;domra&quot;), and &quot;skamarochy-paciesniki&quot; (entertainers who performed dramatic, comedic, and satirical scenes, pantomimes, dances, and more). As carriers of oral poetic and musical folk traditions, they participated in various folk rituals and festivals.

The origins of Orthodox music among the Eastern Slavs can be traced to Byzantine and Bulgarian church music, which arrived in Belarus with Christianity. The 10th–14th centuries were marked by the adaptation of Byzantine hymnography to local conditions. Greek played a significant role in ancient Eastern Christian worship in Belarus, and Byzantine church music was assimilated, while original forms of neumatic notation and an &quot;oktoichos&quot; system with its characteristic set of chants were developed. This period also saw the establishment of single-voiced Orthodox liturgical singing, where the dominant role was given to the text of the hymns.
From the late 10th century, notable singing schools in Belarus included the Polack and Viciebsk schools (established in 992), Smalensk (1001), and Turau (1005). Initially, the practical theory of singing art and its semiography involved the use of non-linear notation symbols, church statutes (&quot;ustavy&quot;), service books, and &quot;padobniki&quot; (the first practical singing manuals). By the 14th century, a system of &quot;znamenny&quot; (neumatic) notation had taken shape. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, traditions of Old Rus&#x27; znamenny chant were initially preserved.

The 15th century saw the flourishing of Orthodox singing culture in Belarus. Authors of hymns and compilers of handwritten musical collections (&quot;irmologions&quot;) began to be recorded. Early singing alphabets appeared, the number of &quot;znamenny&quot; signs increased, and the tonal range expanded toward higher notes. Diverse melodies and musical terminology developed, while local differences in chanting styles deepened. Belarusian hymnography became closely tied to folk-song creativity and everyday culture. Original znamenny chants emerged and became widespread in the singing practice of the 15th–16th centuries, documented in handwritten collections like the &quot;Suprasl irmologiongion&quot; (1598–1601). Greek, Bulgarian, and Serbian chants were widely used, while the semantics of non-linear notation were reinterpreted. Square linear notation arose as Old Rus&#x27; chant transitioned to a new Western European level and polyphonic recording systems. During this period, Belarusian hymnography gradually diverged from the norms of the &quot;oktoichos&quot; system. Spiritual chants (&quot;kanty&quot;) and psalms began to develop, recorded in early handwritten &quot;kantsianaly&quot;, &quot;bahahłasniki&quot;, and catechisms.

During the Renaissance, the role of the secular component in Belarusian musical culture increased. The temple remained the main center for the development of professional musical art. In Belarus, where various religious currents historically intersected, a unique polyconfessional environment emerged in the 16th–18th centuries. Orthodox music coexisted with Catholic, Protestant, and Uniate traditions, as well as with music from non-Christian confessions. From the late 16th century, traditional Orthodox chants coexisted with &quot;Suprasl&quot;, Kyiv-Lithuanian, and Belarusian chants, as well as regional styles such as Viciebsk, Kuceinski, Mahiloŭ, Mir, Niaśviž, and Sluck.

=== Influence on Russian Music ===
From the mid-16th to the 18th centuries, Catholic influences became characteristic. Several Belarusian monasteries were relocated to Russia, including the Kuceinski Monastery near Orša, which became the foundation of one of Russia’s cultural centers, the New Jerusalem Monastery. Here, the &quot;novaierusalimska&quot; school of text and melody creators developed spiritual &quot;kanty&quot; and psalms. Belarusian singers (&quot;vaspiavaki&quot;) joined the patriarchal and imperial choirs in Moscow. Belarusian theorists, alongside Ukrainian and Russian scholars under the guidance of Novgorodian Ivan Šajdura, developed the &quot;kinavarnyja&quot; notational marks and formalized the expanded tonal system (based on tetrachords) widely used in singing practice at the time.

Significant contributions to Orthodox church singing were made by the Iverski and Novadevočy monasteries in Moscow, which were entirely composed of Belarusians. These monasteries produced new manuscripts, hymns, and Belarusian (Lithuanian) chants, including the Vetski, Iverski, and Starysimanaŭski styles. Belarusian singers in Moscow included Ja. Kaniuchoŭski, Ja. Kalenda, I. Dziakoŭski, and I. Koklia from Polack, as well as Dziak Tyzienhauz from Vilnius and A. Bierazanski.

Belarusian A. Miezianiec created the sole theoretical work on znamenny chant, &quot;Izveščenie o soglasnejšich pometach&quot; (1668), while C. Makarjeŭski from near Orša authored &quot;Kliuč razumienia&quot; (late 17th century). Belarusian singing art and &quot;kant&quot; culture significantly influenced Russian liturgical music. By the mid-17th century, all church singing in Moscow was entirely managed by “natives of Poland and Lithuania,” who also served as teachers. Belarusian &quot;cherubic hymns&quot; became part of the Liturgy of John Chrysostom, and various Ukrainian and Russian &quot;irmologions&quot; incorporated these chants.

With the introduction of Belarusian and Ukrainian &quot;kant&quot; culture, polyphonic (&quot;partesny&quot;) singing entered Russia, aiding the transition of Russian church music to a new Western European level.
=== Orthodox Music ===
By the late 16th century, Belarusian choirs of the Vilnius, Niaśviž, Sluck, Minsk, Mahiloŭ, Orša, and Kuceiń brotherhoods were distinguished for performing both spiritual and secular works in 4, 6, 8, and 12 parts. Belarusian monasteries, such as the Suprasl, Blahaveščański, Žyrovičy, and Mahiloŭ monasteries, as well as local churches, served as cultural and educational centers and strongholds of Orthodoxy.

At the Suprasl Monastery, the complete body of Orthodox hymns was transcribed, with B. Anisimavič playing a key role as a compiler. The monastery also produced anti-Catholic and anti-Uniate polemical writings in manuscript form. Elements of Orthodox worship and chanting persisted in Uniate, especially Basilian, monasteries. For example, in the 17th century, several handwritten &quot;irmologions&quot; were created at the Žyrovičy Monastery.

By the late 18th century, new handwritten singing collections were being created, using both square linear and neumatic notations. Copies of older manuscripts were also circulated. During this time, there was an expansion of humanistic and democratic spiritual &quot;kanty&quot;, alongside the development of a rich tradition of Belarusian folk songs and instrumental works.

Following the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th century, Belarusian church music, while retaining its local characteristics, evolved within the framework of Russian liturgical singing. Churches performed canonical hymns approved by the Holy Synod, blending Belarusian traditions with the broader Russian Orthodox musical canon.

=== Catholic Music ===
Catholic music appeared in Belarus in the late 14th century as an integral part of the Roman Rite. The musical accompaniment of Catholic worship was composed of stylistically diverse elements, including the archaic Gregorian chant, vocal-choral works &quot;a cappella&quot; with instrumental accompaniment, instrumental compositions (notably organ music), and religious hymns. The arrival of Catholicism facilitated the cultivation of organ music in Belarus, including cycles of Mass ordinaries, Requiems, individual Introits, Graduals, Sequences, Communions, and Office chants.

==== The Flourishing of Catholic Musical Traditions (16th Century Onward) ====
From the 16th century, Catholic musical traditions in Belarus experienced significant growth. Music, including instrumental music, became a mandatory subject in Catholic educational institutions at all levels. The Jesuit order played a leading role in musical and educational activities. Catholic church music in Belarus developed in close connection with European Catholic institutions, following broader European trends and integrating into the European musical tradition.

In Belarus, various traditions of Catholic liturgical music coexisted:

* Jesuit Tradition: Highly professional and oriented towards the latest European innovations.
* Dominican Tradition: Conservative and protective of earlier practices.
* Franciscan Tradition: Adapted to the tastes of ordinary believers.

The Vilnia Jesuit Academy emerged as a hub of Catholic music, hosting educated European composers and musicians such as Jan Brant, S. Lauksmin, M. Radaŭ, Š. Berant, and M. Krečmer.

==== Catholic Music Printing ====
The 17th century saw an expansion of music printing in Belarus, including works such as:

* Jan Brant&#x27;s &quot;Piesni&quot; (Songs) (1601)
* B. Bartasheŭski&#x27;s &quot;Spieŭnik&quot; (Hymnal) (1613)
* Š. Berant&#x27;s &quot;Litanies&quot; (1638, 1639)
* Various Graduals (1667, 1693, 1742) and Antiphonaries (1667, 1694, 1742) compiled by Žygimantas Liauksminas

Liauksminas also authored the first textbook on the theory of choral singing in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, &quot;Theory and Practice of Music&quot; (1667, 1669, 1693).

==== Franciscan Dominance in the 18th Century ====
In the 18th century, most Catholic music works in Belarus originated from the Franciscan order. Liturgical compositions flourished, with notable contributions from figures such as Franciscan monk Šymkievič and musicians from the Słonim Chapel of M. K. Ogiński, including musicians like J. and L. Grabenbauer.
=== Protestant Influences on Music in Belarus ===
The Protestant denomination significantly influenced the formation of professional musical art in Belarus. Protestantism&#x27;s spread in Belarus during the mid-16th century, under the impact of Reformation ideas embraced by much of the local aristocracy, contributed to the growth of musical culture. Protestants notably advanced music publishing, producing the first Belarusian music printings, including:

* &quot;Bieraściejski Kanciaŭnal&quot; (Brest Cantional) (1558)
* &quot;Niaśvižski Kanciaŭnal&quot; (Nesvizh Cantional) (1563)

These publications reflect the broader impact of Protestantism on Belarusian musical traditions and liturgical culture.

=== Uniate Music ===
In the late 15th to early 16th centuries, the Uniate musical tradition began to take shape in Belarus. This development was linked to significant changes in Orthodox music, including the strong influence of Western European musical culture. The adoption of Western systems of staff notation for recording compositions and the incorporation of polyphonic &quot;partesny&quot; singing (designed in a Western European concert style) marked this transformation.

The Uniate liturgical musical practice, modeled after Catholic traditions, combined several elements:

* Traditional Belarusian-Ukrainian znamenny chant
* Polyphonic choral compositions with either polyphonic or homophonic-harmonic structures (&quot;a cappella&quot; or with instrumental accompaniment)
* Simple, semi-folkloric songs performed by congregants

The Uniates maintained and developed ancient Belarusian-Ukrainian znamenny singing traditions, which were preserved in manuscript irmologions of the 17th–18th centuries from locations such as Supraslaŭ, Žyrovičy, and Smalensk. These traditions also appeared in the first Slavic music prints for Uniate churches, such as the Lviv irmologions (1700, 1709) and Počaev irmologions (1766, 1793), as well as Asmaglasniks (1776, 1793).

==== Instrumental Accompaniment in Uniate Music ====
The Uniate tradition incorporated widespread use of the organ and instrumental ensembles (chapels). The organ at the Žyrovičy Basilian monastery was considered one of the finest instruments of the 17th century.

Uniate centers of musical culture included:

* The Supraslaŭ monastery, which published the first collection of Eastern Slavic religious songs, &quot;Bahahłasnik&quot; (1790)
* The Žyrovičy and Vilnius Basilian monasteries, which were prominent hubs for Uniate liturgical music

=== Music of Non-Christian Confessions ===
From the 16th century, alongside Christian denominations, Belarus was home to non-Christian confessions such as Judaism and Islam, each with distinct musical traditions. These communities contributed to the diversity of musical culture in the region, albeit in separate spheres from the dominant Christian traditions.

=== Secular music ===

Secular vocal and instrumental music is associated with princely castle, military, and urban life. From the 16th century, musical centers were established at royal, grand-ducal, and magnate courts, where talented local and foreign musicians worked. In Hrodna since 1543, the &quot;Litouskaja kapjela&quot; (consisting of 15 musicians, likely of local origin) performed for noble festivities. At the court of Stefan Batory in the 1580s, there was a chapel where authors of vocal and instrumental (mainly lute) works Krzysztof Klabon and Wojciech Dlugoraj worked. At the courts of magnates and grand dukes in the 16th century, the following also worked: Slavic composers Cyprijan Bazylik and Wacław of Szamotuły, Mikołaj Gomółka and Jan Brat, Hungarian lutenist and composer Bálint Bakfark, many Italian musicians, including well-known composers Luca Marenzio, Džovani Batysta Kalola, lutenist and composer Djamjed Kato, organist Antoni Maphon. At the courts of the local aristocracy, both authorial and anonymous works were performed, examples of which have been preserved in the &quot;Vilenski šytku&quot; and Astračmječaŭski rukapis (the so-called &quot;Polacki šytku&quot;; both 17th century).

In the 16th-18th centuries, musical accompaniment was characteristic of theatrical performances in educational institutions of various denominations in cities and towns of Belarus, including Bieraści, Haradnia, Žyrovičy, Mahiloŭ, Minsk, Orša, Polack, and Słonim. In school performances, timed to religious and secular holidays, vocal (chants, psalms, hymns, songs) and instrumental (musical tunes, dances) music appropriate to the content and character of the plays was performed. In intermedes and interludes, played between the main parts of the action, folk melodies were sometimes used. As school theater developed, the role of music in performances grew, and operatic works began to be performed. A manuscript score of one of them has been preserved — &quot;Apalon-zakanadavca, abo Refarmavany Parnas&quot; by R. Vardoсki and M. Ciacerski from the Dominican Collegium in Zabieĺ (1789), which organically combines features of school productions and actual opera.

From the second half of the 18th century, musical centers emerged and expanded at magnate courts, encompassing musical theaters, orchestras-cappellas, and music-theatrical schools. Among the largest musical centers were Niasviž and Słuck (Radziwiłłs), Słonim (Michał Kazimierz Ogiński), Hrodna (A. Tyzenhauz), Škłoŭ (Semyon Zorich), and Dziarečyn (Sapiegaŭ). The stages of magnate theaters presented world opera classics as well as the first local operas, including &quot;Agatka, abo Pryjezd pana&quot; by Ja. Holand and M. Radziwiłł. Concerts featured symphonic and chamber works by Italian, French, Austro-German composers, as well as compositions by local authors. Composers and performers from various countries were invited to the magnate centers. Talented local musicians such as Jerzy Bakanovič, Ljaŭon Sitanski, Jan Ciancyłovič, and future renowned composers like Józef Kozłowski also worked there. Amateur performance and creativity (M. Radziwiłł, M. Kazimir Ogiński) also developed. At the end of the 18th century, due to socio-political events and the destruction of the previous infrastructure of magnate-aristocratic culture, most magnate musical centers ceased to exist and gave way to new forms of musical life. The activities of magnate &quot;musical estates&quot; contributed to the development of various forms of musical creativity, performance, and education in Belarus, the growth of musical professionalism, the formation of theatrical and concert genres, and the creative assimilation of the norms of European classical music.
== Music from the 19th-early 20th Century ==
In the 19th century, interest in Belarusian folk songs was awakened. Alongside the collection, study, and publication of these songs, there were attempts at their compositional arrangement and concert promotion. The first publications of melodies of Belarusian folk songs are found in the works of Maryja Čarnouskaja (&quot;Monuments of Slavic Mythology in Customs Preserved among the Rural Population of Belarus,&quot; 1817), Łukasz Gołębiowski (&quot;Polish People, Their Customs, Superstitions,&quot; 1830), and Anton Abramovič (article &quot;Several Melodies of Belarusians Recorded and Arranged by the Piano Society,&quot; 1843).

The period of intensive accumulation of information about the folk musical culture of Belarusians, recording of tunes and instrumental pieces, and their publication falls on the second half of the 19th — early 20th century. Musical material was included in ethnographic descriptions and folklore collections: &quot;Materials for the Study of the Life and Language of the Russian Population of the North-Western Region&quot; by Pavel Shejn (vol. 1—3, 1887—1902), &quot;Litvins-Belarusians of the Chernihiv Province, Their Life and Songs&quot; by Maryja Kosič (1901), &quot;Belarusians-Saky&quot; by Isaak Serbaw (1915). Separate publications included &quot;Belarusian Songs of the Dzisna County of the Vilnia Province&quot; by Adolf Černy (1895), &quot;Collection of Folk Songs Recorded in the Village of Kaljuga-Kamarna, Ragoznańska Parish of the Kobryn District, Grodno Province&quot; by I. Byčko-Maško (1911). Among important works of this period are: musical &quot;Collection of Little Russian and White Russian Songs of the Homiel District, Recorded for Voice with Piano Accompaniment&quot; (1881) and &quot;Homiel Folk Songs (White Russian and Little Russian)&quot; (1888; described for the first time the ancient type of Belarusian polyphony — heterophony) by Zinaida Radčanka, &quot;Belarusian Collection: Belarusian Folk Melodies. Seasonal, Ritual, Game, Dance, Spiritual Songs&quot; by Jaukima Ramanaw (1910), &quot;Belarusian Songs with Notes&quot; by Anton Hrynevich (vol. 1, 1910). The style of Belarusian two-voice singing was first recorded in the book &quot;Belarusian Songs with Notes&quot; by Anton Hrynevich (with Andrej Ziaziula, vol. 2, 1912). The activities of Michał Fiedarowski and Oskar Kolberg developed in the mainstream of Romanticism and Positivism. In the fundamental collection &quot;Belarusian People&quot; by Michał Fiedarowski, prepared in the 1890s (vol. 5, 1958; vol. 6, 1960), 1413 songs of various genres with melodies recorded and noted by Jan Karlovič, L. Patula, and Ioahim Tračyk were included. In the main Belarusian work in vol. 52 &quot;Belarus-Paliessie&quot; (1968) of the &quot;Complete Collection of Works&quot; (vol. 1—69, 1961—1995) by Oskar Kolberg, 41 melodies with texts of ritual and non-ritual songs were included. The first theorist-ethnomusicologist Ludvík Kuba in the collection &quot;Belarusian Folk Song&quot; (1887) defined the place of Belarusian folk songs in the Slavic world, characterizing their main musical-stylistic features, particularly emphasizing their antiquity compared to Russian and Ukrainian ones. The activities of Mikalaj Janczuk were characterized by organizational scope and innovative scientific approach, which allowed ethnomusicology to gain the status of one of the ethnological sciences. The range of problems outlined and developed in his major musical folklore works &quot;Across the Minsk Province&quot; (1889) and especially &quot;Little Russian Wedding in the Karnicki Parish of the Konstantinów County, Siedlce Province&quot; (1886), allowed a systematic understanding of the musical-song component in the structure of the Belarusian wedding ritual. A special role belongs to the collection &quot;Folk Songs with Melodies&quot; by Maksim Harecki (with Mikalaj Aladaw and A. Jagoraw, 1928), which largely became the prototype of future analytical ethnomusicological collections of the 1980s-1990s.

In the first half of the 19th century, manor theaters, galleries, libraries, and private schools of the magnates Tyszkiewicz in Łahojsk, Astrašycki Haradok, Plesčańicy, Śvislač, Count Zakhar Chernyshev in Mahiloŭ and Čačersk, princes Sapieha in Ružany, the music lover and patron V. Rakićki in Haradzišča near Minsk, gained fame. The spread of home music-making and education was facilitated by the activities of musical salons of Counts Rudolf Tyzenhauz in Žałudok, Grodno Province, and Ludwik Rakićki in Haradzišča, Minsk Province, General Zaviša in Kuchcicy, Prince Michał Kleofas Ogiński in Zaliessie, Minsk Province, and others. Active organizers of home musical evenings were the parents of Stanisław Moniuszko and Vincent Dunin-Marcinkievič.

Intensive musical activity developed in large cities of Belarus—Minsk, Bieraście, Viciebsk, Mahiloŭ, Babrujsk, Hrodna, Homiel, and others. Boarding schools in Minsk, Pinsk, Homiel, Viciebsk, Polack, Słuck, Mścisłaŭ, Biełastok, Bieraście, and Hrodna played an important role in its expansion. In Minsk boarding schools, musical education was obtained by Belarusian pianist, composer, and teacher Kamila Marcinkievič (boarding school of L. and Maryja Montegrandzi), Stanisław Moniuszko, and Florian Miładowski (boarding school of Dominik Stafanovič). The spread of musical culture was facilitated by city orchestras in Minsk (conductors the brothers Dominik and Vicency Stafanovič), Haradzišča (conductor Juzaf Daščynski), Mahiloŭ (conductor Lean Skrebiecki), Homiel (conductor T. Sipajła), Viciebsk (conductor and composer I. V. Šadurski), an amateur orchestra in Hrodna (conductor Ivan Vicencievič Dabravolski); solo performances by pianists Kamila Marcinkievič, F. Miładowski, N. Orda, violinists K. Krzyżanowski, M. Jeĺski, wind instrument players father and son T. and J. Sipajłau, vocalists N. Murańska, J. Rejder, and guitarist K. Strelka. Some musicians engaged in music-theoretical activities: N. Orda created the &quot;Grammar of Music, or Theoretical and Practical Teaching of Melody and Harmony with a Brief Appendix on Fugue, Counterpoint, Orchestral Instruments, Organ, Piano and the Science of Singing for Pianists&quot; (1873), Ja. Hołand wrote the &quot;Academic Treatise on True Musical Art&quot; (1806), Lean Skrebiecki wrote articles about the musical life of Mahiloŭ, and others. Since 1838, a chronicle of musical life was maintained (newspaper &quot;Minskie gubernskie vedomosti&quot;).

In the 19th century, interest in Belarusian folk songs was awakened. Alongside the collection, publication, and study (see Musicology), attempts were made for their compositional arrangement and concert promotion. Belarusian folk song themes or intonations were occasionally used by Polish (F. Chopin, S. Manioŭszka, M. Karłowić) and Russian (N. Rimsky-Korsakov, A. Glazunov) classical composers. Works of the Belarusian composer A. Abramovič (&quot;Belaruskaje viaselie&quot;, &quot;Belarusian Melodies&quot;, &quot;Zacharavanaja duda&quot;) were based on Belarusian folklore. One of the first propagandists of Belarusian song folklore was the Russian choral conductor Dz. Ahreńew-Slaviancki (since 1863). In 1893, several Belarusian songs arranged by M. Kłanowski with symphonic orchestra accompaniment were performed in the hall of the Moscow Nobility Assembly. A significant role in the study and promotion of Belarusian folk songs was played by the music-ethnographic commission of the ethnographic department of the Society of Lovers of Natural History, Anthropology, and Ethnography at Moscow University, organized in 1901 by M. Janczuk. Sergei Taneyev, M. Kłanowski, A. Masław, and J. Engel participated in its work.

In compositional activity during this period, the genres of operetta (&quot;Konkurenty&quot; by F. Miładowski, &quot;Taras na Parnasie&quot; by Jaŭchim Šadurski, &quot;Rekrutski nabor&quot; and &quot;Sialanka&quot; by Stanisław Moniuszko and Kanstancin Krzyżanowski, &quot;Spabornictva muzykaŭ&quot; and &quot;Charadziejna vada&quot; by Stanisław Moniuszko), musical comedy (&quot;Latareja&quot; by S. Moniuszko), as well as instrumental concert (two violin concerts by Michal Jeĺski), instrumental miniature (piano compositions by V. Pšybory, dances for various instruments, including polonaises, mazurkas, angles by P. Karafa-Korbut), piano miniatures (mazurkas by M. Jeĺski, N. Orda, K. Marcinkievič, F. Miładowski, waltzes by A. Abramovič, J. Daščynski, N. Orda, impromptus by F. Miładowski, M. Jeĺski, serenades by N. Orda, &quot;songs without words&quot; by M. Jeĺski and others) stood out.

Alongside secular music, spiritual music was also created. It was written by: J. Daščynski (masses, requiems, vespers, Astrabrama litanies and others), S. Manioŭszka (masses, requiems, Astrabrama litanies, organ compositions, religious songs and others), F. Miładowski (masses, hymns and others), J. Hliński (masses, motets), J. Hrym (masses, organ arrangements and others). Masses on the texts of Polish verse paraphrases of traditional Latin texts became widespread. In Vilnius, church cantionals by E. Tupałski, M. Herburt, Vaškevič, songbooks by J. Hrym, textbooks on organ playing by J. Halin, J. Hrym, masses by L. Herinh, J. Hrym and others were regularly published. There were attempts to create specialized educational institutions for church musicians.

At the turn of the 19th—20th centuries, private music schools operated in Minsk (S. Šackina, since 1894), Mahiloŭ (Piačkoŭskaja, since 1886), Homiel (S. I. Zacharyń, since early 20th century). In 1872—1897, an organist school operated in Minsk (founded by canon F. Sencykoŭski), where piano, violin, singing, music theory, and performance on the organ and in wind orchestra were taught.

The existence of musical instrument factories in Minsk (piano factory of I. Bieławski, preceded by the musical instrument factory of I. Foht, J. Kačkoŭski; in 1858, a church organ was made here) attests to the level of culture in Belarus in the 19th century. In 1896, the press mentioned the depot of pianos and grand pianos by V. L. Valicki.

At the end of the 19th century, there were permanent theaters in Belarus in Minsk (since 1890) and Mahiloŭ (since 1888). The activities of ensemble troupes expanded: A. Metalaw (1877—81, Minsk, Babrujsk; operettas as well as operas &quot;Askold&#x27;s Grave&quot; by Alexey Verstovsky and &quot;Natalka-Poltavka&quot; by M. Lysenko were staged), A. Danilovič, A. F. Kartavy (the first impresario in the new building of the Minsk theater, conductor V. Suk; classical repertoire operas were staged), I. A. Tuman (rented the Minsk theater building from 1892, conductor V. Suk), F. Kastelana (1899—1901, 1903), M. F. Knaufkaminŝkaja (from 1902—03), E. Bialieva (1906—07), O. Susława (April 1906); the Polish operetta troupe of B. Mariecki (November 1906), the Italian troupe of the Hansapec brothers (December 1906) and others. In 1907, a new form of stage art &quot;opera in tails&quot; was presented in the Minsk theater by the Moscow Society of Opera Artists. In the second half of the 19th century, musical societies were organized in Belarus (1860), a Literary and Musical-Dramatic Circle of Amateurs (1884) and the Society of Lovers of Fine Arts (1898) in Minsk, the Brest-Lithuanian Musical and Dramatic Society of Amateurs (1885), the Society of Music and Dramatic Art in Viciebsk (1887), the Brest Musical-Dramatic Circle (1892), the Mahiloŭ Musical-Dramatic Circle (1905—14), the Hrodna Society of Drama and Music Lovers &quot;Muza&quot; (1907—14), the Minsk Society of Friends of Music (1912), &quot;Lyra&quot;, &quot;Lutnia&quot; in Dzińsk, the Musical-Dramatic Society in Homiel, the Society of Fine Arts in Viciebsk and others. Among the musicians who performed in Belarus at that time were L. Auer, M. Batystyńi, A. Vieržbilovič, H. and J. Vieniaŭski, M. Helmar (soloist of the Vienna Opera, native of Minsk), I. Hofman, K. Davydaw, H. Jesipava, A. Ziloty, A. Koncki, S. Mentar, Mikalaj and Miedea Fihnery, F. Shaliapin. In 1895, concerts of S. Rachmaninaw, who performed with the Italian violinist T. Tua, took place in Hrodna, Minsk, and Mahiloŭ. At the turn of the 19th—20th centuries, Belarus was toured by pianists R. Puińio, I. Sliwiński, violinists K. Hryharovič, P. Sarasate, cellist D. Popier, an orchestra of Russian folk instruments under the direction of V. Andrejew and others. In the early 20th century, the work of literary and art societies and music classes attached to them resumed. In 1915, a branch of the Russian Musical Society was organized in Viciebsk (among its directors were M. Arciemoŭič, V. Karmiław, F. Levinson, P. Rengarten, V. Somaw). Since 1907, the Minsk Musical School (director N. Rubinstein) operated with day and evening departments. Each year, 5—6 chamber and symphonic concerts were organized. Introductory lectures were given by I. Patupaw. The Belarusian musical culture was associated with the work of the Polish composer L. Rahowski, who created musical arrangements for the performances of the troupe of I. Buinicki, compiled &quot;Belarusian Songbook with Notes for Folk and School Choirs&quot; (1911) and other musical works, including choirs (among them, on the verse &quot;A kto tam idzie?&quot; by J. Kupala).

==Music of Soviet Belarus==

In the 20th century, the first secondary education institute in Belarus was founded (1924) and the first operas. Popular Soviet Belarusian music was composed by several bands, many of whom performed Belarusian folk music. Folk rock act Pesniary, formed in 1969 by guitarist Vladimir Mulyavin, toured over Europe.

==Modern Belarus==
Belarus gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union and new bands appeared, including N.R.M. Modern poдщхъзззжхз=ъхдзххъъъъъъъъъъъдp stars include Boris Moiseev and Lyapis Trubetskoy (though they tend to orient themselves toward Russia and Russian speakers). Around 2002 a new generation of electronic bands appeared, including the groups like Randomajestiq, Dreamlin.

Rock music of Belarus arose in Perestroika times. Bands like Bi-2 (currently living in Russia), Lyapis Trubetskoy, were founded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of popular music aired on the radio, in favour of traditional music of Belarus. These restrictions have encouraged some Belarusian bands to sign up to Russian labels and to tour more in neighbouring countries.

The tradition of Belarus as a centre of folk and folk rock music is continued today by Stary Olsa, Bristeil and Kriwi, among others.

In 2003, Belarus took part in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time. Their participant, Volha Satsiuk, came in 4th place. In 2004 Belarus made it to the semifinals of the regular Eurovision Song Contest. The country was represented by a duo Aleksandra and Konstantin, who failed to reach the final. They won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005 the following year, with Kseni волк &#x27;s song, &#x27;My Vmeste&#x27;. 

The Belarusian authorities promote folk or &quot;Slavic&quot; music at the country&#x27;s top musical event—the state-sponsored Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, an annual pop and folk music festival in Vitebsk. The biggest festival of Belarusian rock music takes place outside of Belarus, in Gródek, northeastern Poland, a small town some 40 kilometers east of Białystok—the center of Podlaskie Voivodeship, which is inhabited by a 200,000-strong Belarusian minority. The festival, held in July every year since 1990, is organized by the Belarusian Union of Students (BAS) in Poland. The official name of the event is the Music Festival of Young Belarus or Basovišča.

<text>Hydroplane racing (also known as hydro racing) is a sport involving racing hydroplanes on lakes, rivers, and bays. It is a popular spectator sport in several countries.

==Racing circuits==

===International professional outboard hydroplane racing===
The Union Internationale Motonautique (or &quot;UIM&quot;, headquartered in Europe) sanctions many different hydroplane categories of hydroplane powerboat racing. International UIM F-125, F-250, F-350 and F-500 Circuit powerboat races are very popular in Europe, Asia, and the United States. UIM&#x27;s O-series hydroplane Formula Circuit racing events are some of the most prestigious Professional Racing Outboard (PRO) hydroplane events in the world. National powerboat racing teams compete for national and international titles in these hydroplane racing circuits. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) sanction similar PRO class national title events in the United States. Professional F-series World Cup Title powerboat races are held at Europe, United States, and western Asia race site locations every year. Equivalent APBA PRO classes are 125ccH (UIM O-125), 175ccH (UIM O-175), 250ccH (UIM O-250), 350ccH (UIM O-350), 500ccH (UIM O-500), 750ccH (APBA only), and 1000ccH classes. PRO classes using 500cc and larger displacement racing motors must be equipped with an enclosed re-enforced capsule, a certified racing harness restraint system, and a self-contained oxygen system for the driver. The faster classes of PRO hydroplanes (with straightaway speeds from around 75 to 120 miles per hour) use 2-cycle outboard motors running highly filtered methanol race fuel mixed with a pure castor or synthetic castor-based lubricating oil. All methanol-fueled and gasoline-fueled PRO racing outboard motors are direct drive (no gear reduction) and equipped with high performance, motorcycle racing style magneto ignition and carburetor systems. 125cc through 1000cc PRO series hydroplanes are not entry level classes in outboard powerboat racing. Investment costs are moderately high compared to similar APBA stock and modified outboard racing classes. K-PRO (an APBA entry class) is the only PRO hydroplane class running modified, recreational outboard motors; all other PRO hydroplane classes use 2-stroke outboard motors designed and manufactured specifically for PRO circuit racing purposes. Entry level classes for the PRO series classes are gasoline-fueled K-PRO (APBA sanctions only) and OSY-400 (sanctioned by both UIM and APBA.) International UIM teams have a formal crew that usually consists of family members, motor mechanic, hull builder sponsor, and owner/driver team in order to be successful at racing international F-125 through F-500 Circuit hydroplanes. Some hydroplane hull builders sponsor more than one team in a formula series circuit. PRO outboard hydroplane hulls are constructed with lightweight wood, composite, and hybrid (wood/composite/aluminum) materials. Outboard Performance Craft hydroplanes (sometimes called &quot;tunnel boats&quot;) are a different racing series of UIM and APBA outboard powerboat classes. Limited hydroplane racing classes are inboard-engine powered boats that use high performance gasoline fuel.

===Grand Prix hydroplane racing===
Grand Prix (GP) is a class of boats featuring supercharged big-block V8 piston engines producing as much as 1,500 horsepower. The 23- to 26-foot craft are fast—routinely attaining speeds in excess of 170 miles per hour (273.5 km/h) in the straights. This class of boat races in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

===Unlimited hydroplane racing===

Although a bit of a misnomer as the boats aren&#x27;t without limits, unlimited hydroplanes have much fewer restrictions than with limited hydroplane racing. These 30 foot, 6,800 lbs boats most often powered by a Lycoming T55-L7 turbine engine (used from the Vietnam era to the present day in the CH-47 Chinook military helicopter), which is capable of up to 3000 horsepower with current restrictions. The T55-L7 powerplant creates high speed rotational energy, which is transferred through a gearbox at around 50% gear reduction to reduce propeller RPM. Unlimited hydroplanes are capable of speeds of 200+ mph on the straightaways and qualifying average lap speeds range from 130–165 mph. Modern hulls are constructed of composite materials such as honeycomb aluminum, fiberglass, laminated resin and carbon fiber. Many of the restored, fully operable unlimited hydroplanes at the Hydroplane &amp; Raceboat Museum in Kent, Washington (such as the Miss Wahoo and Miss Thriftway vintage restorations) still use piston-powered inline aircraft engines. The primary racing circuit for unlimited racing is the H1 Unlimited, whose season runs from mid-February through September, consisting of five races. H1 Unlimited races occur throughout the United States, and the Middle East.

===Stock and modified outboard racing===

Stock Outboard Racing uses both hydroplane and runabout or monoplane hulls with racing engines that use a service outboard powerhead and a racing lower unit with a direct drive (i.e. start in gear, no gear reduction). Racing in this form ranges from classes designated as follows: A Class, B Class, C Class and D Class. There is also a Junior or &quot;J&quot; Class for kids between the ages of 9 and 16 years of age. The engine sizes range from to with speeds from to . In the C Stock Class, the Yamato Motor Company engines used in Kyōtei boat racing (with parimutuel betting) in Japan, are reconditioned, shipped to the United States and used for racing in these classes.

Modified Outboard Hydroplane Racing classes are powered by modified stock outboard class motors. Motor modifications are limited to strict motor specifications and equipment alterations defined and published in APBA category rule books for these outboard hydroplane racing classes. Both stock and modified outboard classes run on a circular or triangular race course using a 3-minute &quot;milling warm-up&quot; period before a &quot;flying&quot; clock start. Heats usually consist of three laps around a closed race course. Drivers are disqualified if they cross the starting line before the official heat&#x27;s clock start time (called &quot;jumping the gun&quot;.) Just like the Stock &amp; PRO hydroplane racing categories of APBA, the Modified hydroplane racing category membership has its own governing powerboat racing committee and rules book.

==Safety improvements==
In the early days of hydroplane racing, accidents, and even the deaths of drivers, were considered somewhat routine (which was also the case on most early motor racing). As top speeds increased, more attention was paid to driver safety, much like with driver safety programs being instituted in most motor racing series today, such as NASCAR, Formula One, INDYCAR, Grand Prix motorcycle racing, and others. Governing UIM and APBA powerboat racing organizations have promoted and specified many modern technology safety measures and rules for international hydroplane racing. Modern safety technology applications like composite fiber re-enforced Kevlar cockpits, capsule-enclosed driver modules with improved safety harness systems (in PRO, OPC, and limited/unlimited inboard hydroplanes), flip-over incident escape hatches &amp; engine shut-off features, oxygen system &amp; aircraft-quality windscreen canopies for capsule hulls, and advanced ballistic impact-resistant suits with improved helmet/neck brace wear—all of these improvements making the boats and specialized personal protection gear safer for the present-day driver. The HANS device, developed by sportscar racer Jim Downing, has become mandatory in many classes, and future advanced head and spine protection applications (driver upper body control &amp; stabilization during high G-force events) are being tested in future hydroplane capsule designs.

<doc id="561221" wikidata="Q1873049" url="?curid=561221" title="Lucas critique">
<text>The Lucas critique argues that it is naïve to try to predict the effects of a change in economic policy entirely on the basis of relationships observed in historical data, especially highly aggregated historical data. More formally, it states that the decision rules of Keynesian models—such as the consumption function—cannot be considered as structural in the sense of being invariant with respect to changes in government policy variables. It was named after American economist Robert Lucas&#x27;s work on macroeconomic policymaking.

The Lucas critique is significant in the history of economic thought as a representative of the paradigm shift that occurred in macroeconomic theory in the 1970s towards attempts at establishing micro-foundations.

==Thesis==

The Lucas critique was not new in 1976. The argument and the whole logic was first presented by Frisch (1938) and discussed by Haavelmo (1944), among others. Related ideas are expressed as Campbell&#x27;s law and Goodhart&#x27;s law—but in a 1976 paper, Lucas drove to the point that this simple notion invalidated policy advice based on conclusions drawn from large-scale macroeconometric models. Because the parameters of those models were not structural, i.e. not policy-invariant, they would necessarily change whenever policy (the rules of the game) was changed. Policy conclusions based on those models would therefore potentially be misleading. This argument called into question the prevailing large-scale econometric models that lacked foundations in dynamic economic theory. Lucas summarized his critique:

Given that the structure of an econometric model consists of optimal decision rules of economic agents, and that optimal decision rules vary systematically with changes in the structure of series relevant to the decision maker, it follows that any change in policy will systematically alter the structure of econometric models.

The Lucas critique is, in essence, a negative result. It tells economists, primarily, how &quot;not&quot; to do economic analyses. The Lucas critique suggests that if we want to predict the effect of a policy experiment, we should model the &quot;deep parameters&quot; (relating to preferences, technology, and resource constraints) that are assumed to govern &quot;individual&quot; behavior: so-called &quot;microfoundations.&quot; If these models can account for observed empirical regularities, we can then predict what individuals will do, &quot;taking into account&quot; the change in policy, and then aggregate the individual decisions to calculate the macroeconomic effects of the policy change.

Shortly after the publication of Lucas&#x27;s article, Kydland and Prescott published the article &quot;Rules rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans&quot;, where they not only described general structures where short-term benefits are negated in the future through changes in expectations, but also how time consistency might overcome such instances. That article and subsequent research led to a positive research program for how to do dynamic, quantitative economics.

The Lucas critique was an important methodological innovation. It does not invalidate that fiscal policy may be countercyclical, which some associate with John Maynard Keynes.

==Examples==
One important application of the critique (independent of proposed microfoundations) is its implication that the historical negative correlation between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve, could break down if the monetary authorities attempted to exploit it. Permanently raising inflation in hopes that this would permanently lower unemployment would eventually cause firms&#x27; inflation forecasts to rise, altering their employment decisions. In other words, just because high inflation was associated with low unemployment under early 20th century monetary policy does not mean that high inflation should be expected to lead to low unemployment under every alternative monetary policy regime.

For a simple example, consider the question of how much Fort Knox should spend on protection. Fort Knox has never been robbed. Statistical analysis using high-level, aggregated data would therefore indicate that the probability of a robbery is independent of the resources spent on guards. The policy implication from such analysis would be to eliminate the guards and save those resources. This analysis would, however, be subject to the Lucas Critique, and the conclusion would be misleading. In order to properly analyze the trade-off between the probability of a robbery and resources spent on guards, the &quot;deep parameters&quot; (preferences, technology and resource constraints) that govern individual behaviour must be taken explicitly into account. In particular, criminals&#x27; incentives to attempt to rob Fort Knox depends on the presence of the guards. In other words, with the heavy security that exists at the fort today, criminals are unlikely to attempt a robbery because they know they are unlikely to succeed. However, a change in security policy, such as eliminating the guards, would lead criminals to reappraise the costs and benefits of robbing the fort. So just because there are no robberies under the current policy does not mean this should be expected to continue under all possible policies. In order to answer the question of how much resources Fort Knox should spend on protection, the analyst must model the &quot;deep parameters&quot; and strive to predict what individuals will do conditional on the change in policy.

<text>Serge Klarsfeld (born 17 September 1935) is a Romanian-born French activist and Nazi hunter known for documenting the Holocaust in order to establish the record and to enable the prosecution of war criminals. Since the 1960s, he has made notable efforts to commemorate the Jewish victims of German-occupied France and has been a supporter of Israel.

==Early years and later life==
Klarsfeld was born in Bucharest into a family of Romanian Jews that migrated to France before the Second World War began. In 1943, his father was arrested by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; in Nice during a roundup ordered by Alois Brunner. Deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, Klarsfeld&#x27;s father died there. The young Klarsfeld was cared for in a home for Jewish children operated by the Œuvre de secours aux enfants, a French Jewish humanitarian organisation. His mother and sister also survived the war in Vichy France and were helped by the underground French Resistance beginning in late 1943.

Klarsfeld married Beate Künzel in 1963 and settled in Paris. Their son, (born 1965), became a human rights attorney and worked for Nicolas Sarkozy while he was minister of the interior. Klarsfeld helped found and led the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France (&quot;Association des fils et filles des déportés juifs de France,&quot; FFDJF). It is one of the groups that has documented cases and located former German and French officials for prosecution, such as Klaus Barbie, René Bousquet, Jean Leguay, Maurice Papon, and Paul Touvier, who had been implicated in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of French and foreign Jews during the Second World War. The Klarsfelds were among organised groups who filed cases decades after the war, sometimes as late as the 1990s, against such officials for crimes against humanity. In the years before 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Klarsfeld and his wife frequently protested against the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s support for the Palestine Liberation Organization and anti-Zionism.

==Activism==

===Early activism===
In 2012, the archivist of the Stasi revealed that Beate Klarsfeld&#x27;s attack on Kurt Georg Kiesinger, the then German chancellor, by publicly slapping him on 7 November 1968, was carried out in agreement with and the support of the government of East Germany, which was conducting a campaign against West German politicians (&quot;Braunbuch&quot;). Klarsfeld&#x27;s wife was paid 2,000 DM by the Stasi for her actions. Both Klarsfelds were revealed to have been regular Stasi contacts. According to the State Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of Saxony, they cooperated with the Stasi in the 1960s in blackmailing West German politicians for Second World War activities.

In 1974, the Klarsfelds were convicted in West Germany on felony charges of the attempted kidnapping of Kurt Lischka, a former Gestapo chief whose prosecution in Germany was prevented by legal technicalities, in Cologne in order to transport him to France for prosecution. After conviction of felony charges, they were each sentenced to two months in prison. Following international protests, the sentence was suspended. Activism by the Klarsfelds and by descendants of Lischka&#x27;s victims eventually resulted in changes to the laws. In 1980, Lischka was convicted of a felony in West Germany and sentenced to prison, together with his co-defendants: Lischka to ten years of imprisonment, Hagen and Heinrichsohn to twelve and six years respectively. The Klarsfelds&#x27; activities and methods also generated controversy. On 9 July 1979, the Klarsfelds were the targets of a car bombing at their home in France. No one was in the car when the bomb detonated, and no one was injured in the vicinity of the blast. According to the Klarsfelds, individuals purporting to represent the Nazi ODESSA claimed responsibility for the attack.

===Later activism===
The Klarsfelds are notable in the postwar decades for having been involved in hunting and finding German Nazis and French Vichy officials responsible for the worst abuses of the Holocaust, in order to prosecute them for alleged war crimes. Several officials were indicted due in part to the work of the Klarsfelds. They included Klaus Barbie (convicted in 1987), Jean Leguay (died in 1989, with French judiciary officially stating after his death that his involvement in crimes against humanity had been ascertained beyond doubt), René Bousquet (assassinated while set on trial in 1993), Paul Touvier (convicted in 1994), and Maurice Papon (convicted in 1998). In the 1970s, the Klarsfelds considered kidnapping Barbie in much the same way the Mossad did Adolf Eichmann but the plan fell through. They decided instead to bring international pressure to force his extradition. By 1995, only four senior French Vichy officials had been indicted for war crimes, and only Touvier had stood trial.

The Klarsfelds continued to publicize the wartime activities of prominent politicians in Germany and Austria. In 1986, the Klarsfelds campaigned against Kurt Waldheim, a former United Nations Secretary-General who was elected president of Austria amid allegations that he had covered up his wartime activities as an officer in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. In 1996, during the warfare in the former Yugoslavia, the Klarsfelds joined the outcry against Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić for alleged war crimes and genocide of Bosnian Muslims. In December 2009, Klarsfeld defied an existing consensus within the Jewish community by saying that the beatification of Pope Pius XII was an internal matter of the Church. He said that Jews should not get too involved in the process. Many protested the beatification on the grounds that Pius XII had contributed to the persecution of Jews throughout Europe, and had not brought the power of the Church against the Nazis.

===Activism in France===
In 1979, the Klarsfelds created the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France (FFDJF). It defends the cause of the descendants of deportees, to have the events recognised and to prosecute people responsible. In 1981, the association commissioned a memorial in Israel to the deported French Jews; it bears the name, date and place of birth of 80,000 French victims of the Nazi extermination. About 80,000 trees were planted to shape a forest of remembrance. Klarsfeld is also vice-president of the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah. In 1989, FFDJF was one of the groups to file a case against René Bousquet, head of the French Police in the Vichy government, for crimes against humanity. He was indicted by the French government in 1991 but was killed in 1993 shortly before his trial was to begin. Former French president Jacques Chirac acknowledged the nation&#x27;s responsibility for the fate of Jews in its territory during the Second World War, and the government passed a law on 13 July 2000 to establish compensation for orphans whose parents were victims of antisemitic persecution. The Klarsfelds&#x27; work on behalf of the descendants of Jewish deportees had been formally recognised by Chirac in a 1995 speech when he was president. In January 2012, the Klarsfelds, along with prominent French-Armenian singer Charles Aznavour, director Robert Guédiguian, and philosophers Bernard-Henri Lévy and Michel Onfray, signed an appeal to the French Parliament to ratify a bill to establish penalties for people who deny the Armenian genocide. After six decades, the Klarsfelds were noted for their swing away from Nazi hunting to a more-general push for social justice (fight for human life, freedom, and social protection) in opposition to the modern right and neo-fascism.

In 2022, Klarsfeld co-signed an article in &quot;Libération&quot; headlined &quot;No to Le Pen, daughter of racism and antisemitism&quot;. In an interview to &quot;La Stampa&quot; ahead of the 2024 French legislative election, Klarsfeld stated that both he and his wife had voted for Emmanuel Macron to stop the far-right party of Marine Le Pen in 2017 and 2022 but that, while he would keep voting for Macron&#x27;s party in the first round, he would vote for Le Pen and the National Rally, a party founded by former members of the collaborationist Vichy regime, against the left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front, which condemned the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. He argued that the National Rally was no longer a far-right party but a populist group that supports Jews and Israel, and claimed that the New Popular Front was dominated by La France Insoumise and Jean-Luc Mélenchon; he claimed that the radical left had moved to antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and that this represented &quot;a danger&quot;, saying that Mélenchon was antisemitic and against Israel, and that he was &quot;sure of this&quot;. In a La Chaîne Info interview, Klarsfeld confirmed that he had made up his mind if he were forced to choose between the two, saying: &quot;The National Rally supports the Jews, supports the State of Israel, and it&#x27;s quite normal given the activity I&#x27;ve had over the past 60 years, that between an antisemitic party and a pro-Jewish party, I&#x27;ll vote for the pro-Jewish one.&quot; &quot;Le Monde&quot; headlined &quot;Serge Klarsfeld short-circuits history to turn it upside-down&quot;, an article written by academic Michèle Cohen-Halimi, author Francis Cohen, and movie director Leopold von Verschuer. The article called his &quot;unexpected legitimization of the National Rally&quot; a betrayal of the victims of the Nazis that his own research had uncovered.

==Works==
In 1978, Klarsfeld published &quot;Mémorial de la Déportation des Juifs de France&quot; (Memorial of the Deportation of the Jews of France), a book listing the names of more than 80,000 Jews deported from France to Nazi concentration camps or killed in France. Copies of the original lists that were typed up for each deportation train, found by the Klarsfelds in an archive of the Jewish community in Paris, were the basis for the name, place, date of birth and nationality of all deportees, who were listed according to each deportation train. The book records more than 75,700 Jews who were deported to the concentration camps from France and establishes that just 2,564 of the deportees survived the war. Most of the deportees were sent from the transit camp at Drancy, ranging in age from newly born to 93 and originating from 37 countries, the most from France (22,193) and Poland (14,459), with a small number from the United States (10) and even one from Tahiti.

In 2012, Klarsfeld published an updated version of the Memorial of the Deportation of the Jews of France, adding women&#x27;s maiden names, deportees last address in France, and the transit or internment camp they went through. This list is sorted in alphabetic order. From 2018, this memorial is available as an online search engine. Klarsfeld also wrote a preface to &quot;Une adolescence perdue dans la nuit des camps&quot; by Henri Kichka. Klarsfeld and his wife co-wrote an autobiography, &quot;Hunting the Truth: Memoirs of Beate and Serge Klarsfeld&quot;, published in 2018.

==Cooperation with the Stasi==
Since the reunification of Germany and the opening of Stasi files, Lutz Rathenow, the State Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of Saxony, stated in 2012 that Klarsfeld&#x27;s wife had cooperated with the Stasi of East Germany in the 1960s. They gave her material containing incriminating information about the wartime activities of West German politicians. The cooperation of both Klarsfelds with the Stasi and their status as contacts was documented in a book by former Stasi officers Günter Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer.

==Honours==
Recognition for the works of the Klarsfelds included France&#x27;s Legion of Honour in 1984. On 7 July 2010, Klarsfeld was awarded the title of Commander of the Legion of Honour by the then French prime minister François Fillon at Hôtel Matignon, the official residence of France&#x27;s prime minister. In January 2014, the Klarsfelds&#x27; Legion of Honour ranks were upgraded as he became Grand Officer. In May 2015, the Klarsfelds received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Federal Cross of Merit, first class) in recognition of their efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. On 26 October 2015, the UNESCO designated the Klarsfelds as &quot;Honorary Ambassadors and Special Envoys for Education about the Holocaust and the Prevention of Genocide&quot;. On 20 November 2015, Klarsfeld was made the Officer of the Order of Saint-Charles. On 27 May 2024, French President Emmanuel Macron promoted him to Grand-Cross of the Legion of Honour.

==Representation in other media==
The Klarsfelds&#x27; activities related to finding Nazi war criminals were the subject of &quot;Nazi Hunter: The Beate Klarsfeld Story&quot; (1986), an American made-for-TV film. The 2001 documentary &quot;Marlene Dietrich: Her Own Song&quot;, a Turner Classic Movies Production about Dietrich mentions her support of Klarsfeld&#x27;s anti-Nazi activities, while the 2008 drama &quot;&quot; (&quot;La traque&quot;) was a French made-for-TV film, written by Alexandra Deman and Laurent Jaoui and directed by Laurent Jaoui, based on the Klarsfelds. The documentary &quot;La traque des nazis,&quot; (2007) studied Simon Wiesenthal&#x27;s and the Klarsfelds&#x27; activities.

<text>Risky Business is a 1983 American coming-of-age teen comedy film written and directed by Paul Brickman (in his directorial debut) and starring Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay. It follows the sexual exploits of high school senior Joel Goodsen (Cruise), who is staying home alone during his parents&#x27; vacation trip and meets a call girl named Lana (De Mornay). The film is considered to be Cruise&#x27;s breakout role.

&quot;Risky Business&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on August 5, 1983. A commercial and critical success, the film grossed more than $63 million at the box office, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the United States, and received acclaim, with many comparing it to &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967). Cruise&#x27;s performance earned him the first Golden Globe Award nomination of his career.

Retrospective critical analysis has recognized &quot;Risky Business&quot; as one of the best high school and teen films of all time.

==Plot==
High-achieving high school student Joel Goodsen lives with his wealthy parents in the Chicago North Shore area of Glencoe. His father wants him to attend Princeton University, his &quot;alma mater&quot;, so Joel participates in Future Enterprisers, an extracurricular activity in which students work in teams to create small businesses. When Joel&#x27;s parents go away on a trip, his friend Miles convinces him to use his newfound freedom to have some fun. On the first night, Joel raids the liquor cabinet, plays the stereo loudly, and dances around the living room in his briefs and button-down shirt to &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot;.

The following day, Miles calls a prostitute named Jackie on Joel&#x27;s behalf. Jackie turns out to be a male cross-dresser, so Joel pays him just to leave. But, as he is leaving, he gives Joel the number for another prostitute, Lana. That night, Joel is unable to sleep and hesitantly calls Lana, who is revealed as a gorgeous blonde woman, and they spend the entire night having sex.

The next morning, Lana asks Joel for $300 for her services. He goes to the bank, but when he returns, she is gone, along with his mother&#x27;s expensive Steuben glass egg. Joel finds Lana and demands the egg back, but her pimp Guido interrupts them, pulling a gun. While in his father&#x27;s Porsche 928, Joel is chased by Guido, but eventually escapes. Lana tells Joel that the egg is with the rest of her belongings at Guido&#x27;s. He lets her stay at his house while he goes to school. When he returns, his friends have come over, and Lana has invited another prostitute, Vicki, to stay, but Joel rejects the idea. The women leave, only to encounter Guido and get into an altercation on Joel&#x27;s front lawn before running back into his house. Joel agrees to the women spending one more night.

Later that night, Joel, Lana, Vicki, and Joel&#x27;s friend Barry go out and get high on marijuana. After Lana accidentally bumps the Porsche out of gear while retrieving her purse, the car rolls down the hill and onto a pier (despite Joel&#x27;s desperate attempt to stop it); the pier collapses, and the Porsche sinks into Lake Michigan. When Joel takes the car to a repair shop, he is horrified to learn how much fixing it will cost. He and Lana later decide to turn his parents&#x27; house into a brothel for a night; Joel&#x27;s share of the profits will pay for the repairs. The party is hugely successful; the house is packed with Joel&#x27;s friends and classmates and Lana&#x27;s co-workers. However, the recruiter from Princeton, Rutherford, chooses that night to interview Joel for admission to Princeton. The interview is plagued by interruptions, and Rutherford is unimpressed by Joel&#x27;s résumé. Afterwards, he stays at the party and becomes acquainted with Lana&#x27;s friends. After the party, Joel and Lana make love on a Chicago &quot;L&quot; train.

The next morning, when Joel comes home after retrieving his father&#x27;s car from the repair shop, he finds that his house has been burglarized. When he tries to call Lana, Guido answers; he tells him he will let Joel buy back his furniture. Joel and his friends manage to get everything moved back in just as his parents walk in, though his mother notices a crack in her egg. Later, Joel&#x27;s father congratulates him; the interviewer was very impressed, and Joel will be accepted into Princeton.

Joel meets Lana at a restaurant, and they speculate about their future. She tells him that she wants to keep on seeing him; he jokes that it will cost her.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in 670 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of $4,275,327. It went on to gross a total of $63.5 million domestically.

===Critical response===
&quot;Risky Business&quot; is considered by many critics as one of the best films of 1983.
Janet Maslin, in her 1983 review of the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;part satire, part would-be suburban poetry and part shameless showing off&quot; and said the film &quot;shows an abundance of style&quot;, though &quot;you would be hard pressed to find a film whose hero&#x27;s problems are of less concern to the world at large.&quot; She called De Mornay &quot;disarming as a call girl who looks more like a college girl&quot; and credits Cruise with making &quot;Joel&#x27;s transformation from straight arrow to entrepreneur about as credible as it can be made&quot;.

The film holds a 93% rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews, with an average of 7.3/10, with the site&#x27;s consensus stating; &quot;Featuring one of Tom Cruise&#x27;s best early performances, &quot;Risky Business&quot; is a sharp, funny examination of teen angst that doesn&#x27;t stop short of exploring dark themes&quot;. Roger Ebert&#x27;s review was positive, calling it a film of: 

&quot;Variety&quot; said the film was like a &quot;promising first novel, with all the pros and cons that come with that territory&quot; and complimented Brickman on &quot;the stylishness and talent of his direction&quot;.

The film earned a 75 rating on Metacritic.

=== Accolades ===
==Legacy==
The remastered 25th-anniversary edition offers &quot;both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickman&#x27;s original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion&quot;.

In 2015 the film was #31 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The magazine called the film a &quot;sharp satire of privileged suburban teens&quot;, portraying the &quot;soul-crushing pressure to be perfect.&quot;

In the years since the film&#x27;s release, the iconic scene featuring Cruise&#x27;s character sliding across the floor, dancing in just his pink shirt, socks, and white briefs to Bob Seger&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; has been recreated in episodes of many television series, as well as in films, parodies, and advertisements. The song was #100 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Songs list.

<text>Annette Louise Ellis (born 13 October 1946) was an Australian politician who was a Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from the Australian Capital Territory, from March 1996 to August 2010, representing the Division of Namadgi 1996–98 and the Division of Canberra 1998–2010.

In the 1996 federal election she contested the newly created seat of Namadgi against the Liberal Member for Canberra, Brendan Smyth. Notionally, the seat was very safe for Labor; as originally drawn it had a notional Labor majority of 10.9 percent. However, due to the heavy swing nationwide against the Keating government, Ellis was only assured of victory when she received a large flow of Green preferences on the third count. Ellis become one of the few Labor candidates to defeat a Liberal during the landslide election that brought the Howard government to power. Namadgi was abolished after only one cycle, and most of its territory was merged back into Canberra. Ellis transferred to Canberra, and won it easily. She continued to hold it with little difficulty until her retirement prior to the 2010 federal election.

Ellis was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was a public servant, electorate adviser and ministerial adviser before entering politics. She was a member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly from 1992 to 1995.

In Federal Parliament Ellis was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry between 2001 and 2004. She served as Shadow Minister for Ageing and Seniors and Shadow Minister for Disabilities until the 2004 election, after which she retired from the shadow ministry.

She was re-elected in November 2007—with an increased majority—in the election that returned Labor to power federally under new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

She is a leading member of the ACT right wing Labor caucus, Centre Coalition.

<text>James Dunsmuir (July 8, 1851 – June 6, 1920) was a Canadian industrialist and politician in British Columbia. He served as the 14th premier of British Columbia from 1900 to 1902 and the eighth lieutenant governor of British Columbia from 1906 to 1909.

==Early life and business career==
Son of Robert Dunsmuir, he was heir to his family&#x27;s coal fortune. The Dunsmuir family dominated the province&#x27;s economy in the late nineteenth century and was a leading force in opposing organized labour. Dunsmuir managed his family&#x27;s coal business from 1876 until 1910, increasing profits and violently putting down efforts to unionize.

In 1905, he sold his Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway to the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1910, he sold his coal mining companies, Union Colliery of British Columbia and R. Dunsmuir &amp; Sons, to Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd (CCD).

== Opposition to organized labour ==
In the 42 years that the Dunsmuirs owned the collieries, they never recognized their employees&#x27; attempts to unionize or create better working conditions. Dunsmuir used threats, spies, blacklists and scab labour to break strikes. When he could not break a strike with scab labour, he used his influence to have the provincial government call in the militia. Dunsmuir stated to a royal commission, &quot;I object to all unions...They simply take the management of the mine...I want the management of my own works, and if I recognize the union, I cannot have that.&quot;

Dunsmuir provoked further rage when he ordered workers to relocate their homes at a new pit. Workers also resented low wages and the dangerous conditions that Dunsmuir imposed upon them. Mine owners at the time regularly ignored safety and sanitary conditions, and provincial inspectors were slow to bring them to justice.

Dunsmuir contributed to the mines of British Columbia being among the most dangerous in the world. Between 1889 and 1908, twenty-three men were killed in the production of every million tons of BC coal; the average for North America as a whole was six deaths per million tons. In 1901, while serving as Premier, many men perished in his collieries.

== Political career ==
Dunsmuir entered provincial politics in 1898, winning a seat in the provincial legislature, and he became the 14th Premier in 1900. His government attempted to resist popular pressure to curtail Asian labour and immigration, not for humanitarian reasons, but to ensure a cheap labour pool for business. It also promoted railway construction and accomplished a redistribution of seats to better represent population distribution in the province.

Dunsmuir visited England and the United States in 1902, but disliked politics after his return and resigned as Premier in November 1902. In 1906, he became the province&#x27;s eighth Lieutenant Governor. He retired in 1909 and lived out his remaining years at the baronial mansion that he had constructed at Hatley Park.

==Legacy==
Dunsmuir founded the town of Ladysmith, British Columbia. Hatley Castle, the Edwardian mansion and gardens where he spent his last years is now a Classified Federal Heritage Building on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.

One of his daughters, Jessie Muriel, married, as her first husband, the couturier Edward Molyneux. His second-born son, James A. Dunsmuir Jr., died in the sinking of the &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot; in 1915. His last child, Dola Dunsmuir, married Lieutenant-Commander Henry Cavendish and was rumored to be Tallulah Bankhead&#x27;s lover.

He is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

<text>Kay Selma Elson (born 25 January 1947), Australian politician, was a Liberal Member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1996 until her retirement in November 2007. Kay represented the Division of Forde, Queensland. She was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and was a special events co-ordinator for a handicapped association, a shop proprietor and a financial consultant before entering politics. Elson is married to David, a beekeeper and bush poet. Elson has eight children, 24 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Elson had contested a total of four Queensland state elections prior to her candidacy for federal parliament. She ran for Woodridge in 1983 as a Nationals candidate, Springwood in 1986 as an independent candidate, and Albert and Broadwater in 1989 and 1992 respectively as a Liberal Party candidate. She ran as &quot;Elson, Selma Kay&quot; for the 1983 election.

Elson was preselected as the Liberal candidate in Forde for the 1996 election. The seat was originally a safe Labor seat, but a redistribution added some Liberal-friendly territory in the Scenic Rim, which all but erased Labor&#x27;s majority. Elson defeated Labor incumbent Mary Crawford on a nine-percent swing, turning Forde into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke. Her victory was part of Labor&#x27;s near-total collapse in Queensland; Labor was cut down to only two seats there.

In October 2006, Kay Elson announced that she would not be seeking a fifth term and retired at the 2007 Election. By this time, she had built up her majority to 12 percent. However, the seat was lost to Labor on a 14-point swing, making it one of the safest Coalition seats to be gained by Labor.

<doc id="561253" wikidata="Q1262400" url="?curid=561253" title="Mende people">
<text>The Mende are one of the two largest ethnic groups in Sierra Leone; their neighbours, the Temne people, constitute the largest ethnic group at 35.5% of the total population, which is slightly larger than the Mende at 31.2%. The Mende are predominantly found in the Southern Province and the Eastern Province. The Mende are mostly farmers and hunters. Some of the major cities with significant Mende populations include Bo, Kenema, Kailahun, and Moyamba.

Like a majority of African nations, Sierra Leone&#x27;s political parties are often tied to specific ethnic groups and have been dominated by the Mende, on the one hand, and the Temne and their long-time political allies, the Limba, on the other. The Mende are known to typically support the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP), while the Temnes and Limbas are associated with the All People&#x27;s Congress party (APC).

==History==
In their oral tradition, the Mende describe themselves as being a mixture of two peoples: their original members were hunters and fishers who sparsely populated the area in small peaceful settlements, and their leaders came later, in a recent historical period, bringing with them the arts of war, and also building larger, more permanent villages. This is supported by analyses of their language and culture, which show signs of a layering of two different forms; they have both matrilineal and patrilineal inheritance, for instance. These leaders described in oral histories were almost certainly Mane people who descended into the coastal lowlands from the area near Moussadou, Guinea in the 16th century. They conquered and mixed with the native Bullom people to form the Mende.

Regional warfare throughout the 19th century led to the capture and sale of many Mende-speakers into slavery. Most notable were those found aboard the &quot;Amistad&quot; in 1839. They eventually won their freedom and were repatriated. This event involved fifty-two free Mende people, stolen by Portuguese slavers in 1839, who were shipped via the Middle Passage to Havana, Cuba, where they were sold to Cuban sugar plantation owners, José Ruiz and Pedro Montes.

After working the plantation, they were placed on the schooner Amistad and shipped to another Cuban plantation. On the way, they escaped their bondage and were led in a rebellion by Sengbe Pieh. They told the crew to return them to Africa. Their efforts to return home were frustrated by the ship&#x27;s remaining crew, who navigated up to the United States. The ship was intercepted off Long Island, New York, by a U.S. Coastal brig. The Cubans merchants Ruiz and Montes denounced the Mende and asserted that they were their property. The ensuing case, heard in Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut, affirmed that the captives were free, and resulted in the return of the thirty-six surviving Mende to their homes.

In the Americas, especially the United States, researchers have discovered that elements of African culture had long persistence. In some areas where there were large groups of enslaved Africans, they kept much of their heritage.

== Language ==
The Mende people speak the Mende language (also called Boumpe, Hulo, Kossa, or Kosso), which belongs to the Mande language branch of the proposed Niger-Congo language family. In the 1930s African-American linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner found a Gullah family in coastal Georgia that had preserved an ancient song in the Mende language (&quot;A waka&quot;), passing it down for 200 years. In the 1990s three modern researchers – Joseph Opala, Cynthia Schmidt, and Tazieff Koroma — located a Mende village in Sierra Leone where the same song is still sung today. The story of this Mende song, and its survival in both Africa and the US, is chronicled in the documentary film &quot;The Language You Cry In&quot;.

==Traditional social structure==
The Mende are divided into five clans: the &quot;Kpa-Mend&quot;e, who are predominantly in the Moyamba district to the south; &quot;the Golah-Mende&quot;, who inhabit the Gola forest between Kenema and Pujehun districts into Liberia; &quot;Sewa-Mende&quot;, who settled along the Sewa River; the &quot;Vai-Mende&quot;, who are also in Liberia and the Pujehun district of Sierra Leone; and the &quot;Koh-Mende&quot;, who are a dominant tribe in Kailahun district.

The Mende traditionally live in villages of 70 to 250 residents, which are situated from 1.5 to 5 kilometers apart. There is little or no mechanization over the greater part of rural Mende country. Mende farmers use hoes and machetes, but few other tools. The Mende are generally known as growers of rice and several other crops, practicing crop rotation to protect soil productivity. Coffee, cocoa, and ginger are grown as cash crops, whereas rice, pepper, groundnuts, beniseed (also known as sesame seeds), and palm oil are grown for local consumption. Rice cooperatives have been formed in some rural areas.

Traditionally, Mende farming has been carried out by labour groups organised on a local basis and moving from farm to farm (NIIP, 1973). Work is divided by gender: men attend to the heavy work of clearing the land for planting rice, while women clean and pound rice, fish, and weed the planted crops. This routine is followed during ten months of every year, with a couple of months left around the New Year, when they can spend more time in the village engaging in domestic pursuits like house building.

The Mende are patrilineal, patrilocal, and polygamous. The household unit is represented by at least one man and perhaps several of his brothers, with all of their wives and children. One or more brothers and married sisters usually leave sooner or later and are incorporated into other residential units. The senior male has moral authority—the right to respect and obedience—over the family as a whole, especially with regard to the negotiation of debts, damages, and bride-wealth.

==Secret societies==

===Poro society===

The greatest sins a Mende man can commit is to give away the secrets of their tribe. The &quot;Poro society&quot; is the male equivalent to the female &quot;Sande society&quot;. When inducted into this society, Mende boys are initiated into manhood. Many of their rituals parallel those of the Sande society.

During their training, the initiates learn everything that is essential for the survival of the community. The process is described as being reborn, transformed, and—during a masquerade—as being &quot;regurgitated&quot; into fully socialized adult men.

The Poro prepares men for leadership in the community, so they might attain wisdom, accept responsibility, and gain power. It begins with the child&#x27;s grade of discovery, followed by extensive training and service. During the seven-year initiation period, the young men converse with each other using a secret language and passwords, known only to other Poro members. The member always knows and understands what is being said. This is part of the mystery of this secret society.

At the beginning, young men aged 20 are called into the society and are trained by the group above them, along with a few elders. There is much work to be done during the initiation process. Dancing the masks is part of this work, but not the most important part. Only through work does the dance of the mask become meaningful.

The Mende have always had a remarkable enthusiasm for secret societies. According to Kenneth Little, writing in the 1960s, even the prevalence of Poro societies was far more widespread among Mende than Temne.

===Sande society===

All Mende women when they reach puberty begin the initiation process into the &quot;Sande society&quot;. The goals of this secret society are to teach young Mende women the responsibilities of adulthood. The girls are taught to be hardworking and modest in their behavior, especially towards their elders. Sande influences every aspect of a Mende woman&#x27;s life; it is present before birth and still present after.

Sande is the guardian of women: their protector and guide through life. It is Sande that grants a woman with an identity and a personality. The Sande society is concerned with defining what it is to be human and with discovering the ways of promoting love, justice, and harmony. It is a moral philosophy that focuses on the perpetual refinement of the individual.

Sande leaders serve as models to women in the community. They exemplify the highest of Mende ideals, and they have the duty of enforcing positive social relationships and of removing any harm that might come to women in their community. &quot;This is Sande; women together in their womanhood, in a free exchange of words and actions among sisters. Wherever two or three women are gathered together, there is the spirit of Sande.&quot;

Sande groups conduct masked performances that embody the Sande guardian spirit, who is associated with water and rivers. Descriptions of the society and its masquerade events have been made by visitors since the seventeenth century.

===Sande hierarchy===
The Sande society is organized by a hierarchy a number of positions all around. The &quot;sowie&quot; are the highest-ranking leaders of the group. It is their job to model to the Mende women the most important Mende social values. It is also their duty to enforce proper social relationships and to remove anything that might be harmful to the women in their community.

The sowie have control over certain sacred knowledge that is essential to the development of success and happiness in an individual, and also to the well-being of the community. They are the experts of the Sande women and have access to spirit ancestors and forces of nature.

The rank below sowie is &quot;ligba&quot;. There are two grades within ligba; Ligba Wa (senior) and Ligba Wulo (junior). In any group there is only one Ligba Wa; she is an executive officer in Sande. Before a woman can take a leadership role in artistic activities she must be eligible at least as a Ligba Wulo.

An ordinary member is referred to as &quot;nyaha&quot;. The word indicates that the Sande initiation makes a woman of a child, and every woman into a wife. An initiate in training is called &quot;mbogdoni&quot;. A non-member is &quot;kpowa&quot;. As a noun kpowa means &quot;an ignoramus, stupid, retarded, a fool&quot; as a verb it means &quot;to become insane or deranged.&quot;

== Female culture ==

===Arts===

Much Mende art is in the form of jewelry and carvings. The masks associated with the fraternal and sorority associations of the Marka and the Mende are probably the best-known and finely crafted in the region. The Mende also produce beautifully woven fabrics which are popular throughout western Africa, and gold and silver necklaces, bracelets, armlets, and earrings.

The bells on the necklaces are of the type believed capable of being heard by spirits, ringing in both worlds, that of the ancestors and the living. Mende hunters often wear a single bell that can be easily silenced when stealth is necessary. Women, on the other hand, often wear multiple bells, referring to concepts of community, since the bells ring harmoniously together.

====Mende masks====
Masks are the collective Mind of Mende community; viewed as one body, they are the Spirit of the Mende people. The Mende masked figures are a reminder that human beings have a dual existence; they live in the concrete world of flesh and material things and the spirit world of dreams, faith, aspirations and imagination.

The features of a Mende mask convey Mende ideals of female morality and physical beauty. They are unusual because the masks are worn by women. The bird on top of the head represents a woman&#x27;s natural intuition that lets her see and know things that others can&#x27;t. The high or broad forehead represents good luck or the sharp, contemplative mind of the ideal Mende woman. Downcast eyes symbolize a spiritual nature and it is through these small slits that a woman wearing the mask would look out of. The small mouth signifies the ideal woman&#x27;s quiet and humble character. The markings on the cheeks are representative of the decorative scars girls receive as they step into womanhood. The scars are a symbol of her new, harder life. The neck rolls are an indication of the health of an ideal woman. They have also been called symbols of the pattern of concentric, circular ripples the Mende spirit makes when emerging from the water.

In the Mende culture, full-figured women are beautiful. The intricate hairstyles reveal the close ties within a community of women. The holes at the base of the mask are where the rest of the costume is attached. A woman who wears these masks must not expose any part of her body or a vengeful spirit may take possession of her. Women often cover their bodies with masses of raffia or black cloth.

When a girl becomes initiated into the Sande society, the village&#x27;s master woodcarver creates a special mask just for her. Helmet masks are made from a section of tree trunk, often of the kpole (cotton) tree, and then carved and hollowed to fit over the wearer&#x27;s head and face. The woodcarver must wait until he has a dream that guides him to make the mask a certain way for the recipient. A mask must be kept hidden in a secret place when no one is wearing it.

These masks appear not only in initiation rituals but also at important events such as funerals, arbitrations and the installation of chiefs. Examples of these masks appear in museums. Various Mende masks, specifically Sowei Masks, were the focus of a 2013 exhibition in the British Museum, exploring the Sowei traditions.

===Dancing===
Learning dance is a harsh discipline that every Mende girl must tackle. Girls practice for hours at a time until they drop from exhaustion. &quot;Ndoli jowei&quot;, the expert in dancing, is in charge of teaching young Mende girls to dance. When girls make a mistake in the steps, they are whipped with a switch until they get it right.

Often girls are awoken in the middle of the night to practice the dance; sometimes they are forced to stay awake for nearly 48 hours dancing almost the entire time. By the end of their brutal training, the girls have transformed into young woman who are tough and confident even in the harshest of conditions. They are in great physical shape and have endurance and stamina.

==== The role of Gonde ====
The traditional character of &quot;Gonde&quot; is also a &quot;Ndoli jowei&quot; or dance instructor, but rather than a harsh enforcer, she acts as the comic relief. Gonde becomes a friend to the initiates, amusing them to help them forget the hard ordeals they are going through. She coaches the slower dancers, encouraging them to work hard. &quot;Gonde is a funny, lovable character who lightens the gloom and reminds everyone that Sande is not always so deadly serious.&quot;

==== Ndoli jowei ====
Ndoli jowei is the principal spirit for celebration, although she also appears on other occasions besides celebrations. In Sande initiation, there are three major events in which the ndoli jowei appear publicly. The first occurs 1–3 days after the initiates have been taken into the bush to be circumcised. This event is known as &quot;yaya gbegbi&quot;.

At this time the ndoli jowei comes into town with a group of Sande women while the initiates stay in the bush recovering from their operations. The women come into town to tell men they have initiated people into Sande. They go through the town waving leaves and gathering food and other supplies that they need.

Ndoli jowei does not dance on this occasion because it is not yet time for celebration. She is there only as a reminder of the powerful medicine which has been summoned by the Sande session. This validates the unruly behavior of the Sande women.

The next time ndoli jowei appears is at a minor feast called &quot;Kpete gbula yombo le&quot; or &quot;Sowo mba yili gbi&quot;. At this occasion, an announcement is made to inform people of the date for the &quot;gani&quot; celebration; which is the last event of the Sande initiation that ndoli jowei appears at. At this time, the new initiates are brought into town for the first time since the initiation process began; accompanied by ndoli jowei. This is a happy occasion where dances are performed by both the maskers and the initiates.

Ndoli jowei masks can be found in various museums. The British Museum has a raffia and cotton wood mask in its possession. The estimated date of production of this particular mask is between 1880 and 1886. It has been part of numerous exhibitions. Previous exhibitions of the British Museum&#x27;s Ndoli Jowei piece are as follows:

=== White clay ===
&quot;Hojo&quot; is a white clay that Mende women use to mark their territory. The clay comes from the water like many other aspects of Sande. Its smooth, shiny surface reflects light, making it eye-catching. Hojo is found in a scale of colors from beige to pure white. The pure white Hojo is rarer, found only deep beneath the surface of the water. Hojo and Sande are parallel in that they are both well hidden and secretive in its purest form.

White is the color of Sande. To the Mende, the pureness of white signifies the cleanliness and absence of imperfections. &quot;It shows a &#x27;harmlessness&#x27;; it is void of all things evil and is thus &#x27;a positive and helpful color. White is symbolic of the spirit world and also of the secret parts of society where people aim for the highest standards.

Objects and people who are marked with Hojo are under Sande protection and control. They are subject to the authority of Sande law and punishment. Initiates are colored with this white clay to show that they are the property of Sande. This signifies that they are under the protection of Sande and should not be fooled with. &quot;Sowei&quot;, the judge of women, wears white to represent clear thinking and justice.

===Hair===
A woman&#x27;s hair is a sign of femininity. Both thickness and length are elements that are admired by the Mende. Thickness means the woman has more individual strands of hair and the length is proof of strength. It takes time, care and patience to grow a beautiful, full head of hair. Ideas about hair root women to nature, the way hair grows is compared to the way forests grow.

The vegetation on earth is the &quot;hair&quot; on the head of Mother Nature in the same way the hair on the head of a woman is her &quot;foliage.&quot; (Boone) A woman with long, thick hair illustrates a life force, she may be blessed with a green thumb giving her the ability to have a promising farm and many healthy children.

Hairstyles are very important in Mende society. A Mende woman&#x27;s hair must be well groomed, clean, and oiled. Hair must be tied down under strict control and shaped into intricate, elegant styles for the sake of beauty and sex appeal. Dirty, disheveled hair is a sign of insanity. A woman who does not groom and maintain her hair has neglected the community&#x27;s standards of behavior. Only a woman in mourning can let her hair loose. The Mende find unarranged &quot;wild&quot; hair immoral and associate individuals who possess this trait with wild behavior.

=== Female Circumcision ===
A key element of Sande initiation is the clitoridectomy, or female genital mutilation. This surgery is supposed to foreshadow the pain a Mende woman experiences during childbirth. The shock of this experience also tests a Mende woman&#x27;s physical endurance. The shared pain of the clitoridectomy creates permanent bonds among the initiates. Vows that express a social bond are taken after the operation; these vows are a metaphor for the support the women will have during the pains of childbirth.

This procedure is considered necessary to change Mende children, who are considered to be of neutral sex before the procedure, to heterosexual, gendered adults. Traditional female circumcision is thought to remove the female&#x27;s residue of maleness.

===Neck rings===
The neck rings at the base of the mask are an exaggeration of actual neck creases. Mende people consider a beautiful neck to be one with rings as it shows adolescent girls becoming ready for childbearing by the increase in body fat. The rings indicate prosperity and wholesome living, and are given by God to show his affection for a fortunate few.

The rings also indicate a relationship with the divine: the &quot;Sowo&quot; itself is a deity from the waters, and the neck rings represent the concentric waves that are formed on still water by Sowo&#x27;s head breaking through the surface. The spirit comes from the water, and what the human eye sees on the necks of women &quot;is human in form, but divine in essence&quot;, as portrayed in the mask.

==Kikakui syllabary==

The Mende Kikakui script was invented in 1917 by Muhamad Turay and popularized by his son-in-law Kisimi Kamara (c. 1890–1962), a Kuranko man in Sierra Leone. During the 1920s and 1930s, he ran a school in southern Sierra Leone to teach &#x27;Ki-ka-ku&#x27;. The syllabary became a popular method of keeping records and writing letters and achieved widespread use for a time. During the 1940s, the British set up the Protectorate Literacy Bureau in the city of Bo to teach the Mende to read and write with an alphabet based on the Latin script, and Kikakui&#x27;s use declined. The Mende script has been described as a &quot;failed script&quot;.

American historian Konrad Tuchscherer, while researching his Ph.D. thesis for the School of Oriental and African Studies in London during Sierra Leone&#x27;s civil war, found that instead of impeding his research the war actually advanced it. Thousands of Mendes were taking shelter in huge refugee camps surrounding the cities of Bo and Kenema, and the people living in those camps were organized according to their home chiefdoms, making it possible for Tuchscherer to survey the entire Mende region (about half of Sierra Leone&#x27;s territory) in a small space and a short period of time. He found that the Mende syllabary, far from being forgotten, was still being used by quite a few people, mostly elderly men.

==Politics==

The politics of Sierra Leone have traditionally been dominated by the Mende. The Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP), which is one of the two major political parties in the country, is predominantly based among the Mende people. The SLPP gets most of its support in Mende- predominate south-east region of Sierra Leone.

Most of the country&#x27;s top government positions have been held by the Mende. Sierra Leone&#x27;s first Prime minister Sir Milton Margai, who led the country to independence from the United Kingdom on April 27, 1961 was a prominent member of the Mende ethnic group. Other prominent Sierra Leonean politicians from the Mende ethnic group include the country&#x27;s second prime minister Sir Albert Margai, who was also the younger brother of Milton Margai; former commander of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and former Sierra Leone&#x27;s head of state Brigadier David Lansana; former Sierra Leone&#x27;s vice president Albert Joe Demby; former Sierra Leone&#x27;s vice president and attorney general Solomon Berewa.

Former Sierra Leone&#x27;s vice president minister of Justice and Attorney General Francis Minah and Samuel Hinga Norman, who was Sierra Leone&#x27;s minister of Defense and former leader of the militant group the Civil Defense Forces (commonly known as the Kamajors). Sierra Leonean politician Charles Margai, who is the leader of one of the country&#x27;s main opposition party the People&#x27;s Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC). He is also the son of former prime minister Albert Margai and the nephew of Milton Margai; and former Sierra Leone&#x27;s minister of finance John Oponjo Benjamin, who is currently the National Leader of the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP).

== Women&#x27;s political influence in Mende society ==
The Mende are a well-documented example of a non-western, pre-industrial society in which, at least historically, women took more political leadership positions relative to men. In the pre-colonial era, the Mende had female chiefs and war leaders. One such female chief, Madam Yoko (1849–1906), was the leader of the vast Kpa Mende Confederacy. She was formally recognized by the British as a Paramount Chief in 1894, ruling an area that was eventually divided into fourteen chiefdoms.

Although it is impossible to know the extent to which other Mende women rose to leadership positions comparable to Madam Yoko&#x27;s, historians believe that perhaps fifteen to twenty percent of the local leaders with whom the British negotiated at the time of colonial consolidation were women. The pattern continues to this day. According to MacCormack, &quot;Contemporary women paramount chiefs are equally prominent, and their political influence now extends into national and international arenas. In 1988, thirteen of the 146 paramount chiefs were female.&quot;

MacCormack further notes, &quot;There is a tendency in Western culture to define women as weak and needing protection, since they bear children. In West Africa the same biological facts are given a different cultural interpretation. The bearing of children demonstrates that women are strong and active agents in a society, capable of holding political office.&quot; Lynda Rose Day, another authority on Mende female chiefs, writes that &quot;Women rise naturally to leadership positions when they are senior wives in large polygynous households, when they are the oldest living relatives of a large landholding descent group, or when they are heads of local Sande chapters. Mothers with many children are seen as strong, capable authority figures.&quot;

<text>A McWord is a word containing the prefix &quot;Mc-&quot;, derived from the first syllable of the name of the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant chain. Words of this nature are either official marketing terms of the chain (such as &quot;McNugget&quot;), or are neologisms designed to evoke pejorative associations with the restaurant chain or fast food in general, often for qualities of cheapness, inauthenticity, or the speed and ease of manufacture. They are also used in non-consumerism contexts as a pejorative for heavily commercialized or globalized things and concepts.

==Examples==
=== Official McDonald&#x27;s products and branding concepts ===

* McCafé
* McInternet – A free Wi-Fi service in some U.S. McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. In Venezuela and Brazil, it is an Internet cafe service offered in several McDonald&#x27;s restaurants.
* McState, now McHire – The McDonald&#x27;s job and career search service.
* McWorld – The term was used in a mid-1990s McDonald&#x27;s advertising campaign depicting a world ruled by children. It is also used in a critical way to emphasize the deprecation of local culture in favor of a global culture prescribed by large corporations.
* McNuggets
* McChicken
* McDouble
* McRib
* McFlurry
* McMuffin

=== McWords not officially related to McDonald&#x27;s ===
*

*McChurch – A megachurch.
* McDonaldization – the process by which a society takes on the characteristics of a fast-food restaurant.
* McDojo – A martial arts school (dojo) seen as sacrificing pedagogic principles in favor of offering rapid advancement through the various ranks, often requiring a fee to be paid to achieve a higher rank (often denoted by a colored belt, hence the use of another pejorative name, &quot;belt factory&quot;, analogous to a degree mill).
* McJob – A low-paying job in which one serves as an interchangeable cog in a corporate machine; originally appearing in an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1986 and later popularised by Douglas Coupland&#x27;s novel &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot;.
* McLibel case and &quot;McLibel&quot; (film)
* McMansion – Quickly-built mansions; a group of large houses built in the same style in the same area.
* McMindfulness – A term coined by Ron Purser debunking the &quot;mindfulness revolution&quot;.
* McOndo – A Latin American literary movement. The name is a spoof on the fictional village of Macondo.
* McPaper (or McNews) – A newspaper that is considered manufactured and &quot;for the masses&quot; because of its simplistic prose style and flashy use of colors. Typically used in reference to &quot;USA Today&quot;.
* McRefugee – people who stay overnight in a 24-hour McDonald&#x27;s.

==See also==
* Cocacolonization
* Disneyfication
* Walmarting
* &quot;Tesco Value&quot; for a similar usage in the UK, referring to the supermarket Tesco&#x27;s own budget brand.
* Internet-related prefixes

<text>Peaks Island is the most populous island in Casco Bay, Maine. It is part of the city of Portland and about from downtown. The island is served by Casco Bay Lines and has its own elementary school, library, and police station. Due to its size, it is the only island in Casco Bay that allows cars throughout.

While small, the island has a variety of businesses, including an ice cream parlor, restaurant, grocery store, kayak rentals, golf cart rentals, art galleries, the Fifth Maine Regiment Museum, and the Umbrella Cover Museum.

The island was originally known as Pond Island. It became Michael&#x27;s Island after Michael Mitton was given the island on a 60-year lease by his father-in-law, George Cleeve. It was subsequently named Munjoy&#x27;s Island, for George Munjoy, and Palmer&#x27;s Island, for Munjoy&#x27;s son-in-law John Palmer.

==Notable visitors and places==
George M. Cohan tried his productions out at the island&#x27;s Gem Theater before taking them to Broadway. Jean Stapleton&#x27;s first professional appearance was in a 1941 production at Greenwood Garden Playhouse. Martin Landau made his professional stage debut in a 1951 production of &quot;Detective Story&quot; at Greenwood Garden, where for several seasons he was a resident cast member.

The Gem Theater was destroyed by fire on September 7, 1934. In a 1936 fire, the Union House Hotel burned down, as did a row of stores on the north side of Island Ave., including Augustus Carlson&#x27;s Restaurant, Brackett&#x27;s Grocery, Small&#x27;s Bakery, John Cox&#x27;s gift shop, and eight cottages.

During World War II, the island was home to a large military defense installation, including the largest structure, Battery Steele, which housed two 16-inch (406-mm) guns. When Battery Steele&#x27;s guns were first tested, windows on the opposite side of the island shattered.

==Population==
The island had an estimated population of 858 in 2017; its population increases in the summer by 2,000 to 4,000.

==Secession efforts==
There have been at least six significant movements for Peaks to secede from the city of Portland: in 1883, 1922, 1948, 1955, 1992, and between 2004 and 2011. The most recent effort grew out of a revaluation of the municipality&#x27;s properties, when average property taxes on Peaks Island increased by over 200 percent. Shortly thereafter, a group of island residents organized a committee to investigate seceding from Portland and forming a separate town. A successful petition drive put the issue to an island-wide vote on June 13, 2006. Of a total of 683 votes, over 57 percent were in favor of secession.

The Portland City Council unanimously opposed secession. The council and the secession group, after arguing over whether to hold talks in public or private, failed to negotiate terms. In February 2007 the secession group obtained sponsorship for legislation in the Maine State Legislature to incorporate the Town of Peaks Island, subject to a successful referendum. After vigorous debate, the bill was narrowly tabled, &quot;dead&quot; in committee as of May 14, 2007.

As a result of the secession fight and the urging of state legislators, the Portland City Council agreed to create a seven-member Peaks Island Council for direct liaison. But in 2010 most members of the Peaks Island Council resigned, expressing frustration with Portland&#x27;s unwillingness to work with them. With only write-in candidates taking the vacant seats, the council ceased to fulfill its function. Ongoing discussions between city officials and the council&#x27;s former chair about establishing some degree of autonomy, such as creating a village corporation within the city, proved unproductive.

As a result of a change in the Maine legislature from Democratic to Republican control, the secession effort regained momentum, with a new bill introduced in 2011 providing for a January 2012 island-wide vote on secession. But hearings showed an apparent lack of consensus among the islanders. The State and Local Government Committee rejected the bill on the ground that the secession leaders had not followed the legal process: they would need to start over with signature gathering and another referendum.

<text>King Island is an island in Bass Strait, belonging to the Australian state of Tasmania. It is the largest of four islands known as the New Year Group and the second-largest island in Bass Strait (after Flinders Island). The island&#x27;s population at the was 1,617 people, up from 1,585 in 2016. The local government area of the island is the King Island Council.

The island forms part of the official land divide between the Great Australian Bight and Bass Strait, off the north-western tip of Tasmania and about halfway to the mainland state of Victoria. The southernmost point is Stokes Point and the northernmost point is Cape Wickham. There are three small islands immediately offshore: New Year Island and Christmas Island situated to the northwest and the smaller Councillor Island to the east, opposite Sea Elephant Beach.

King Island was first visited by Europeans in the late 18th century. It was named after Philip Gidley King, Colonial Governor of New South Wales, whose territory at the time included what is now Tasmania. Sealers established temporary settlements on the island in the early 19th century, but it was not until the 1880s that permanent settlements were established. The largest of these is Currie, situated on the island&#x27;s west coast. Today, the island&#x27;s economy is largely based on agriculture and tourism. It is also home to the Huxley Hill Wind Farm.

== History ==
King Island was originally part of a land bridge linking Tasmania with the Australian mainland, which was submerged around 12,000 years ago due to rising sea levels. A human skeleton was discovered in a cave on the island in 1989, which was dated to approximately 14,000 years ago. However, previous examinations had revealed no &quot;shell heaps, bones, charcoal or other remains which might indicate Aboriginal occupation&quot;, suggesting that the area was traversed by the ancestors of Aboriginal Tasmanians but not permanently inhabited. It was uninhabited at the time of European discovery.

Captain Reed is the first known European to discover King Island in 1799 while hunting seals in the schooner &quot;Martha&quot;. Matthew Flinders’ first map of &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; and &quot;Basses Strait&quot;, which was sent to England (before Flinders had left) and was published in June 1800, did not show King Island. However, before Flinders left Sydney for England in 1800, Captain Black had informed Flinders of the existence of the island. Flinders&#x27; second map of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and Bass&#x27;s Strait (properly finished en route to England) and published with his Observations in 1801 shows: 

&quot;Land of considerable extent has been seen about this situation&quot;. 

Although the impressive granite tower, Australia&#x27;s tallest lighthouse, was finished and the light first lit on 1 November 1861, the Cape Wickham Lighthouse was only officially opened in November 2011 at a community celebration of the light&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

Captain John Black also visited the island just after Reed and named it King&#x27;s Island after Governor Philip Gidley King. Captain John Black was sailing in the brig &quot;Harbinger&quot;, after which the dangerous Harbinger Rocks off the island&#x27;s north-west coast are named. It was found to abound in both fur seals and Southern elephant seals, which were soon exploited to local extinction.

Governor King, knowing that the French navigator Nicolas Baudin was going to head for the island, when he left Port Jackson in 1800, sent the &quot;Cumberland&quot; from Sydney to claim the islands formally for Britain. The &quot;Cumberland&quot; arrived just before the French, and the British had hastily erected the British flag in a tree. Baudin still circumnavigated and extensively mapped the island in 1802, giving French names to some localities that are still in use today like &quot;Phoques Bay&quot; on the north-west coast.

As a result of this incident, British settlements were established at the River Derwent and Port Dalrymple in Tasmania and later Port Phillip.

Sealers continued to harvest the island intermittently until the mid-1820s, after which the only inhabitants were some old sealers and their Australian Aboriginal wives who mostly hunted wallaby for skins. The last of these left the island in 1854, and for many years it was only occasionally visited by hunters and more often castaways from shipwrecks.

The first submarine communications cable across Bass Strait in 1859 went via King Island, starting at Cape Otway, Victoria. It made contact with the Tasmanian mainland at Stanley Head, and then continued on to George Town. However, it started failing within a few weeks of completion, and by 1861 it failed completely. A later telephone and telegraph cable across Bass Strait operated via King Island from 1936 until 1963.

In the 1880s the land was opened for grazing. A township developed at Currie, and the post office opened on 1 June 1892 (known as King&#x27;s Island until 1903, King Island until 1917, thereafter Currie). Currie, on the west coast, now has the only post office on the island, but in the past Grassy, in the southeast (1918–35, 1943–91), Naracoopa on the east coast (1920–62), Pearshape to the south (1946–59) and Egg Lagoon in the north (1925–67) replacing Yambacoona (1922–25) all had official post offices. The other localities of King Island are Bungaree, Loorana, Lymwood, Nugara, Pegarah, Reekara, Sea Elephant, Surprise Bay, Wickham and Yarra Creek. All share the postcode 7256.

=== Shipwrecks ===

Situated in the centre of the western entrance to Bass Strait, King Island has been the location of more than 60 known shipwrecks, involving the loss of more than 2,000 lives. Many King Islanders are descendants of shipwreck survivors. 

Notable shipwrecks include:

*1801, large unidentified three-masted full-rigged ship, probably a whaler. No survivors known.
*1835, , convict ship 327 tons, 225 lives lost.
*1840, &quot;Isabella&quot;, full-rigged ship 287 tons, no lives lost.
*1843, &quot;Rebecca&quot;, barque 243 tons, five lives lost.
*1845, &quot;Cataraqui&quot;, full-rigged ship 802 tons, 400 lives lost.
*1854, &quot;Brahmin&quot;, full-rigged ship 616 tons, 17 lives lost.
*1854, &quot;Waterwitch&quot;, schooner 134 tons, no lives lost.
*1855, &quot;Whistler&quot;, American clipper ship, 942 tons, two lives lost.
*1855, &quot;Maypo&quot;, brig 174 tons, two lives lost.
*1865, &quot;Arrow,&quot; schooner 166 tons, one life lost.
*1866, &quot;Netherby&quot;, full-rigged ship 944 tons, no lives lost.
*1871, &quot;Loch Leven&quot;, iron clipper ship 1868 tons, one life lost.
*1874, &quot;British Admiral&quot;, iron clipper ship, 79 lives lost.
*1875, &quot;Blencathra&quot;, iron barque, 933 tons, no lives lost.
*1910, &quot;Carnarvon Bay&quot;, steel full-rigged ship 1932 tons, no lives lost.
*1920, &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, timber, three-masted brigantine, 257 tons, at least 9 lives lost.

== The island today ==
=== Currie ===
Currie, the largest town and administrative centre, is situated on the west coast of the island.

=== Grassy ===
The township of Grassy, on the island&#x27;s east coast, is approximately 32 km south east of Currie. It was a thriving mining town where scheelite was extracted from an open-cut mine until 1974 when two underground mines were brought into production. After the mine closed in 1990, the mine site was rehabilitated, the town sold and the pit allowed to flood.

In recent years the Grassy population has increased again and consists of local families, sea-changers, a campus of Ballarat Clarendon College and holiday makers. There is a service station, a supermarket and several shops and restaurants. Grassy is also known for the little penguin rookery near the port (safe harbour) and platypus at the Upper Grassy Dam. There are ferries servicing the island with freight services between Victoria, northern Tasmania and Grassy Harbour.

A new $12.3 million wave power demonstration project is planned. Sitting partially submerged on the seabed, the Uniwave 200 will use oscillating water column technology to push air into a chamber fitted with an electricity-generating turbine.

=== Naracoopa ===
The village of Naracoopa is situated on the east coast about from Currie and is known for its beach, jetty (fishing), holiday accommodation and eateries. There is a sheltered BBQ area and public toilets on the foreshore.

Naracoopa was the chief bulk fuels port and depot and is the site of a mineral sands deposit from which rutile, zircon and ilmenite were extracted between 1968 and 1977. The attractions of Naracoopa are the 100-year-old Naracoopa Jetty, blow hole and calmer weather.

== Economy and culture ==
The island is noted for its production of cheese, lobsters, bottled rain water, kelp and beef. The island&#x27;s beef industry was seriously affected by the closure of the island&#x27;s only abattoir, owned by Argentinian company JS Swift, in September 2012. It is a safe harbour for passing yachts and the site of the Huxley Hill Wind Farm operated by Hydro Tasmania.

The island has a football competition. The King Island Football Association, with just three teams, Currie, Grassy and North, competes annually in the Stonehaven Cup boat races, the Imperial 20-foot race, Queen&#x27;s Birthday Weekend Pheasant Season and many other activities.

The island was the proposed location for the development of Australia&#x27;s largest windfarm. This wind farm split the community into those for and against but eventually proved uneconomic to construct. The proposal was shelved in late 2014.

The Dolphin mine, located on the southeast side of the island, is one of the largest tungsten reserves in Australia.

== Environment ==

=== Birds ===
The King Island emu was endemic to the island. Although numerous bones have been found, the only existing skin was collected by Nicolas Baudin in 1802, shortly before the species became extinct, probably as a result of hunting by sealers for food.

Some 193 km2 of the island, consisting of the coastline in a strip extending from the low water mark to one kilometre inland of the high-water mark around the entire island, with a broader area encompassing Lavinia State Reserve in the north-east, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). The main feature making it an IBA is that it supports the small population of critically endangered orange-bellied parrots (&quot;Neophema chrysogaster&quot;) on the migration route between their breeding grounds in south-western Tasmania and their wintering grounds in mainland south-eastern Australia. More recently the &quot;King Island Biodiversity Management Plan 2012–2022&quot; identified Lake Flannigan as important in this regard.

The IBA includes the nearby Christmas, New Year and Councillor Islands, which support breeding seabirds and waders. The IBA supports significant numbers of hooded plovers, flame robins and fairy terns, more than 1 per cent of the world populations of short-tailed shearwaters, pied and sooty oystercatchers, black-faced cormorants and pacific gulls, as well as populations of ten bird species endemic to Tasmania, including seven subspecies endemic to King Island.

=== Climate ===
King Island has a borderline Mediterranean (&quot;Csb&quot;)/oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild summers and wet winters.

<text>The Absorbing Man (Carl &quot;Crusher&quot; Creel) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #114 (cover dated March 1965), in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Carl Creel has the power to absorb and become any material he touched. Originally a supervillain, in later years, he has reformed into more of an antihero.

Since his original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise such as trading cards. He appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, portrayed by Brian Patrick Wade.

==Publication history==
The Absorbing Man debuted in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #114 (March 1965), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He appeared in the 2017 &quot;Black Bolt&quot; series, by Saladin Ahmed.

==Fictional character biography==
Carl &quot;Crusher&quot; Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the Asgardian god Loki laced with a mystical potion. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing metal from the guards&#x27; bullets and goes on to battle Thor. When he escapes, he takes with him the ball and chain to which he was shackled, and uses the ball and chain as a weapon. Although he is only mortal, Creel&#x27;s fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki&#x27;s kidnapping of Jane Foster. Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer&#x27;s powers to transform the ground&#x27;s molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens, he drifts harmlessly into the atmosphere.

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor&#x27;s fighting skill, Loki transports him to Asgard and reveals the true source of his &quot;absorbing&quot; powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts Odin himself. Creel absorbs Odin&#x27;s attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin&#x27;s Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, with the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find that they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished into outer space.

The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the Hulk. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leaped aboard and began absorbing the Hulk&#x27;s strength. He tries to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turns back to human form, the Absorbing Man is unable to support the great weight and was buried.

However, Creel goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the Avengers, Daredevil, the Dazzler, the Hulk, and Spider-Man. He is one of the villains who participates in the Secret Wars, and also develops a romantic relationship with the super-strong villainess Titania. The pair also join the reformed fourth version of the Masters of Evil. Creel has several more battles with Thor (and the Eric Masterson Thor) and a skirmish with the cosmic hero Quasar. Although he assisted Crossbones in a plan to attack Captain America, when Absorbing Man learned that Crossbones intended to detonate a bomb in New York, he absorbed the properties of Captain America&#x27;s shield to contain the blast, declaring that he was not a murderer.

Creel is later incarcerated in an experimental prison called the Big House, where all prisoners are shrunken via Hank Pym&#x27;s &quot;Pym Particles&quot;. An escape attempt is thwarted by She-Hulk.

The Absorbing Man escapes prison and allies with the Owl as an enforcer, but finds himself opposed by Spider-Man and new hero Ethan Edwards (later revealed to be a disguised Skrull). He is briefly trapped and converted into a new form of cocaine by one of the Owl&#x27;s operatives when they become frustrated with his unprofessional approach, with the new drug briefly giving those who snort him a degree of his powers, but he reassembles himself and goes after the Owl for revenge. Spider-Man defeats Creel by tricking him into running a gauntlet where he absorbs multiple objects thrown at him, culminating in Creel absorbing two different chemicals that cause him to explode.

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero Sentry during the events of &quot;Civil War&quot;. However, he later appears at the funeral of Stilt-Man.

Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine She-Hulk and her Skrull partner Jazinda after they attempt to arrest Creel&#x27;s cousin Rockwell &quot;Hi-Lite&quot; Davis.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Creel joins a new version of the Lethal Legion led by the Grim Reaper. After a defeat, Creel escapes prison and absorbs a shard of the Cosmic Cube.

The Absorbing Man suffers a setback when villain Norman Osborn uses an enchanted sword—provided by Loki—to remove his absorbing powers completely.

Creel is also revealed to be the father of the hero Stonewall.

Creel regains his powers and storms Avengers Tower to recover his ball and chain. He is defeated by Avengers&#x27; coordinators Maria Hill, Sharon Carter, and Victoria Hand after absorbing the latter&#x27;s cold.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Creel and Titania encounter two of the divine hammers that contain the essences of the Worthy, generals to Odin&#x27;s brother and adversary, Cul Borson. Coming into contact with the hammers, Titania and Creel were transformed into Skirn: Breaker of Men and Greithoth: Breaker of Wills, respectively. They later went on a rampage depicted in a number of &quot;Fear Itself&quot; tie-in issues, most prominently &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; #15–19 and &quot;Iron Man 2.0&quot; #5–6, as well as that storyline&#x27;s core miniseries.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Absorbing Man appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s unnamed supervillain group during the fight against Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form. He is briefly converted to heroism when everyone on the island experiences a moral inversion as Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch attempt to bring out the Charles Xavier in Red Skull, joining the new Astonishing Avengers assembled by Steve Rogers and Spider-Man to oppose the inverted heroes. Absorbing Man later reverts to villainy when the inversion is undone.

When Absorbing Man and Titania were robbing an armored car, the female Thor appeared to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocked her for being a woman and for having taken Thor&#x27;s name for herself, which she answered by breaking his jaw. Titania then appeared to confront her but, in respect for what she was doing, she knocked out her husband with his own weapon and surrendered.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline of 2015, Absorbing Man is among the villains attending Kingpin&#x27;s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Absorbing Man was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Absorbing Man into a man named Harold. During his time as Harold, Absorbing Man ran an ice cream parlor and was in love with Sheriff Eva. When Helmut Zemo and Fixer restored the memories of the inmates, Absorbing Man joined in on their uprising with Whirlwind. Illuminati members Hood and Titania arrived at Pleasant Hill to retrieve Absorbing Man. Although he was shaken from having a S.H.I.E.L.D.-induced normal life, Absorbing Man sides with the Illuminati as they work to assemble the other inmates to get revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Absorbing Man is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.

At some point, Absorbing Man was imprisoned in a deep space torture prison. He was defeated by Black Bolt in combat. Absorbing Man later made an acquaintance with Black Bolt and fellow inmates Blinky, Metal Master, and Raava. Upon taking in Black Bolt&#x27;s sonic scream, Absorbing Man seemingly sacrifices himself to help destroy the torture prison&#x27;s Jailer, enabling Black Bolt and the other inmates to escape. Later, Titania visits Parkwood Cemetery, where Absorbing Man suddenly emerges from his grave. Absorbing Man and Titania helped Black Bolt fight a Jailer-possessed Blinky until they managed to drive Jailer out of him.

After Absorbing Man was imprisoned for another crime, his lawyer convinced him to join the U.S. Hulk Operations as an alternative to getting incarcerated for life. He gets injected with a Bannerman Gene-Enhancement Package that turned him into a gamma mutate able to absorb gamma radiation, at the cost of turning his skin a bright red color. When Absorbing Man - under the alias of Red Dog - fought Hulk at Los Diablos Missile Base, an entity, the One Below All entered his body after he absorbed most of the Hulk&#x27;s gamma energy. The One Below All taunted Red Dog&#x27;s astral body before ripping his physical one in half. Absorbing Man, still controlled by The One Below All, continues fighting Hulk. Absorbing Man ran off when Jackie McGee, Walter Langkowski, and Puck showed up. When the One Below All successfully opened the door to the Below Place, the lowest point of Hell, the entirety of New Mexico gets transported there as Absorbing Man weeps. With the help of Puck, Creel was able to transfer the gamma energy he had absorbed back into Hulk, who used his thunder clap to disperse the One Below All&#x27;s cloud form and transport New Mexico back to Earth. Creel has since been freed of the One Below All&#x27;s influence, having transferred the gamma radiation back to the Hulk, joining Gamma Flight in the process.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Carl Creel has the ability to mimic the matter or strength of anything nearby or anyone he is near. Most commonly, the Absorbing Man uses his powers to duplicate the qualities of anything that he touches—solids, liquids, gases, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the items that Creel was wearing and carrying when Loki&#x27;s magic potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal titanium, his body, clothes, and wrecking ball takes on its appearance and properties). He can absorb sufficient mass from a large object (e.g., a building) to attain the same height. While in different alternate forms, he still maintains his intellect, capacity for speech, and full physical movement (although his first attempt at absorbing water temporarily cost Creel&#x27;s sanity when he tried to keep himself from drifting apart in the ocean). His body was able to reform itself after being broken or damaged, especially a severed arm which Wolverine cuts off during the &quot;Secret Wars&quot;.

Creel&#x27;s overall power increases in direct proportion to the material he duplicates. There seems to be almost no limit to what Creel absorbs, as he have mimicked the properties of bronze; Odin&#x27;s Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm; diamond; glass; light; rock, silk, soil; spikes; steel; Thor&#x27;s uru hammer Mjolnir; water; and even the whole realm of Asgard itself, although draining the Sentry&#x27;s energies proved too much for Creel, causing him to become overloaded with it and nearly killing him. Creel is also now capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.

<text>George Anthony Walkem (November 15, 1834 – January 13, 1908) was a British Columbian politician and jurist.

==Life and career==
Born in Newry, Ireland, Walkem moved to then Colony of British Columbia in 1862 and served as a member of the Colonial Assembly (Cariboo East and Quesnel Forks District) from 1864 to 1866 and the appointed Legislative Council (Cariboo) from 1866 to 1870. He was a supporter of Canadian Confederation. With the admission of the colony into Canada, Walkem was elected to the provincial legislature from the riding of Cariboo in 1871 and became attorney general in the cabinet of Premier Amor De Cosmos and succeeded him to become the third premier of British Columbia.

Walkem&#x27;s government pressured Ottawa to meet its commitment to build a railway to the Pacific Ocean but was initially unsuccessful. Walkem fought the 1875 election facing charges that he had failed to secure railway construction and had increased the province&#x27;s debts by engaging in expensive public works projects. The government was re-elected with a reduced majority but he was also accused of plunging the province into debt by engaging in public works that it could ill afford (see Lillooet Cattle Trail). Nevertheless, his government was returned, albeit with a reduced majority but grievances continued.

The Walkem government&#x27;s financial difficulties mounted and his government lost a Motion of No Confidence in early 1876 and was replaced by a new government formed by Andrew Charles Elliott with Walkem becoming Leader of the Opposition. Elliot&#x27;s government was unstable and collapsed within two years leading to early elections which allowed Walkem to form a second government in 1878 as the fifth premier, with a comfortable majority.

The new Walkem government opposed &quot;cheap Chinese labour&quot; and inserted a clause banning the hiring of Chinese workers in all its contracts. The government also attempted to levy a special tax restricted to Chinese which was struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada. In the election campaign Walkem had threatened to lead British Columbia out of confederation if the federal government did not commence construction of the promised railway by 1879. The provincial government appealed directly to London resulting in the British government pressuring Ottawa to fulfill the deal.

In 1882 Walkem narrowly survived a Motion of No Confidence due to rising costs of a project to build a dock on Vancouver Island but lost the subsequent election due to hostility from Islanders who had a disproportionate number of seats in the legislature and thus were able to bring down the Walkem government.

Walkem was appointed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon retiring from politics in 1882, sitting on the court until his retirement in 1904.

George Anthony Walkem is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

<text>Craig Anthony Emerson (born 15 November 1954) is an Australian economist and former politician. A member of the Australian Labor Party, he served as the Australian House of Representatives Member for the Division of Rankin in Queensland from 1998 until 2013. Emerson also served as Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Minister for Competition Policy, Small Business and Consumer Affairs in the Rudd and Gillard Governments.

==Early life==
Emerson was born in Baradine, New South Wales to Ern and Marge Emerson, and raised as a Roman Catholic. He and his late elder brother, Lance, were subjected to physical and emotional abuse from their mother, Marge. He was intensely religious as a child, finding solace from his turbulent home life, recalling that &quot;Catholicism helped me make sense of Mum&#x27;s volatile behaviour where there was no sense to be made of it.&quot; He earned a bursary to attend St Patrick&#x27;s College, Strathfield. He later attended the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Economics (Honours) and a Master of Economics. He also holds a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics from the Australian National University.

== Early career ==
Early in his career, Emerson variously worked as an economic analyst with the United Nations, an economic adviser to the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Finance Senator Peter Walsh, an Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and economic and environmental adviser to Prime Minister Bob Hawke. He became Director-General of the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage in 1990, where he became embroiled in the Cape Melville affair. He was chief executive officer of the South East Queensland Transit Authority from 1995 to 1996.

Following the defeat of the Goss Government in 1996, Emerson set up a small business partnership, Eco Managers, with former economic adviser to Premier Wayne Goss, Raymond Garrand. They advised various clients on electricity supply issues in Queensland and global petroleum companies on energy policy.

==Parliamentary career==
Representing the Australian Labor Party, Emerson was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Member for Rankin at the 1998 federal election.

Emerson was appointed Shadow Minister for Innovation, Industry, Trade and Tourism from 2001 to 2003, and then Shadow Minister for Workplace Relations and the Public Service from 2003 to 2004. Emerson was relegated to the backbench following the 2004 Australian federal election, having supported Simon Crean and Mark Latham in leadership ballots against the wishes of his Right faction in Queensland. While on the backbench he wrote a book, &quot;Vital Signs, Vibrant Society&quot;, proposing new economic and social policies for the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. Following the election of Kevin Rudd as Leader of the Labor Party and Julia Gillard as Deputy Leader in December 2006, Emerson was appointed Shadow Minister for the Service Economy, Small Business and Independent Contractors.

On 3 December 2007, Emerson was named Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation in the newly elected Rudd ministry. In June 2009, he was also appointed Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs.

On 14 September 2010, Emerson was appointed the Minister for Trade, expanded to Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in a ministerial reshuffle announced on 2 March 2012. On 28 October 2012, the Gillard Government released a White paper on Australia in the Asian Century Emerson of which Emerson was the architect. Emerson was assigned the role of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Asian Century Policy.

In March 2013, in a further reshuffle of ministerial responsibilities, Emerson gained an additional portfolio as Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research. However, after a leadership change in the federal Australian Labor Party in June 2013 in which Kevin Rudd took over as prime minister from Gillard, Emerson resigned his ministerial portfolios and said he would not contest his seat at the next election. Following the Australian federal election held a few months later in September 2013, Jim Chalmers took over from Emerson as the MP for the seat of Rankin in Queensland.

==Post-parliament==
After leaving parliament, Emerson established an economic consulting firm, Craig Emerson Economics Pty Ltd. His clients have included Wesfarmers, Coles, AGL Energy, Santos, the BCA, the ACTU and the PNG Government. Emerson is an adviser to KPMG. He was also a regular presenter on Sky News Australia for some years after leaving parliament.

In 2014, Emerson was appointed an adjunct professor of Victoria University. He was also a member of the CEDA Council on Economic Policy and chair of the advisory board, Centre for Transformative Innovation, Swinburne University of Technology. Emerson was also President of the Australia China Business Council NSW and a board member of Obesity Australia.

In February 2018, Emerson&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Boy from Baradine&quot;, was published by Scribe Publications.&#x27;

In August 2018, Emerson was involved in public disagreement with Sky News Australia when he resigned in protest as a commentator for the TV network when Sky News broadcast an interview with the right-wing Australian activist Blair Cottrell. Emerson said that, &quot;My father fought Nazis in World War II and was interred in a German POW camp.&quot; Explaining his decision on Twitter, he said that the decision by Sky News to screen the interview with Cottrell was &quot;another step in a journey to normalising racism and bigotry in our country.&quot;

In November 2018, Emerson was appointed Distinguished Fellow at the Australian National University. In March 2019, Emerson was appointed Director of the Australian APEC Study Centre at RMIT University. Emerson was also chair of the McKell Institute and The Australian Alliance for Animals.

On the subject of Australia-China relations, Craig Emerson consistently argued prior to 2022 that the poor relationship was partly caused by Australia. In September 2023, Emerson led The Australian delegation of the resumed High Level leadership Dialogue to Beijing, where he also met with China&#x27;s foreign minister Wang Yi.
Emerson and former South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, assisted by Lenda Onsalem, John Graham and senators Anthony Chisholm and Linda White, conducted the ALP&#x27;s review of the 2019 federal election loss. Newly elected Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, referred to the Emerson-Weatherill report as a blueprint for the 2022 election campaign. Emerson was also a panellist assisting Greg Combet and Lenda Onsalem in the review of Labor&#x27;s successful 2022 election campaign.

Following the election of the Albanese government, Emerson was appointed chair of the Australia Political Exchange Council.
In late-2022, small business minister, the Hon Julie Collins MP, commissioned Emerson to conduct a Statutory Review of the Payment Times Report Act 2020, making recommendations to improve the payment times of large businesses to their small business suppliers. The report was given to The Australian government in June 2023.
In September 2023, Emerson was appointed by trade minister, Don Farrell, to the Australian government&#x27;s Trade 2040 Taskforce to advise the government on its trade policy agenda to the year 2040.

In January 2024, Emerson was appointed by the Albanese government to lead a review into the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct.

In February 2024, Emerson was appointed a member of the National Competition Council.

<text>Caseless ammunition (CL), or caseless cartridge, is a configuration of weapon-cartridge that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer, propellant and projectile together as a unit. Instead, the propellant and primer are fitted to the projectile in another way so that a cartridge case is not needed, for example inside or outside the projectile depending on configuration.

Caseless ammunition is an attempt to reduce the weight and cost of ammunition by dispensing with the case, which is typically precision made of brass or steel, as well as to simplify the operation of repeating guns by eliminating the need to extract and eject the empty case after firing. Its acceptance has been hampered by problems with production expenses, heat sensitivity, sealing, and fragility. Its use to date has been mainly limited to prototypes and low-powered guns, with some exceptions.

== Internal-propellant caseless ammunition ==
=== Description ===
Older caseless ammunition typically uses a rocket-like configuration which integrates the primer and propellant into the bottom of the projectile and accelerates it by venting propellant gas out the back. Unlike rocket projectiles, which have similar configurations, the propellant of &quot;internal-propellant caseless ammunition&quot; has an instant burn time like a traditional cartridge (under 0.2 seconds), meaning the propellant burns up before the projectile leaves the barrel, preferably inside the chamber. Rocket projectiles, in comparison, have propellant burn times of over 0.2 seconds, usually several seconds, meaning rocket propellant traditionally propels the rocket for a certain distance from the launcher.

Another difference is means of fire and stabilization. As a cartridge, internal-propellant caseless ammunition is only fired from gun barrels, either closed or recoilless, and achieves ballistic stabilization through longitudinal spinning (conservation of angular momentum), either by the use of driving bands and rifling or oblique nozzles for the propellant gas. Rockets, in contrast, can be fired from more platforms than gun barrels, for example, rails, and traditionally use fins for stabilization, either fixed or foldable.

=== History ===
An early type of internal-propellant caseless ammunition was Walter Hunt&#x27;s Rocket Ball cartridge. It was developed in the 1850s and the guns using it were sold primarily by Volcanic Repeating Arms. Hunt&#x27;s Rocket Ball cartridges were severely under-powered and never saw wide acceptance for self-protection, hunting, or military use.

During World War II, Germany began an intensive program to research and develop a practical internal-propellant caseless ammunition cartridge for military use, which was driven by the rising scarcity of metals, especially copper used to make cartridge cases. The Germans had some success, but not sufficient to produce a caseless cartridge system during the war. One quasi-example which almost entered production was the 55 mm Maschinenkanone MK 155. It used partially combustible cartridges similar to the ones used in the popular Rheinmetall Rh-120 tank gun today. Japan, however, successfully developed an aircraft mounted autocannon using internal-propellant caseless ammunition during the war. Named Ho-301, it was a 40 mm autocannon and saw limited action in the defense of the Japanese home islands during the waning months of the war.

After WWII the use of internal-propellant caseless ammunition largely disappeared from mainstream weapons development; however, the type saw a small resurgence when the Soviet Union introduced their GP-25 40 mm internal-propellant caseless under-barrel grenade launcher in 1978. This was followed by the Russian-developed AGS‑40 Balkan 40 mm internal-propellant caseless automatic grenade launcher in 2017.

=== Issues ===
Since propellant is blasted out the back of the projectile during fire, many historical guns using internal-propellant caseless ammunition have had problems with residue buildup from the propellant, leading to malfunctions. To decrease residue buildup, historical systems have often been forced to use lower amounts of propellant in the ammunition or adopting a recoilless solution for the gun where some of the burning propellant is vented out the back of the gun when firing. This, however, causes problems on its own as less propellant is being used to propel the ammunition, leading to less potent muzzle velocities, often under the speed of sound (~). This is equal to the muzzle-velocities of many mortar-weapons which are meant to be fired at high angles of elevation with heavy projectile arcs. Caseless ammunition weapons are often meant for horizontal fire, meaning that highly sub-sonic ammunition leads to very limited range and poor accuracy due to the rapid loss of projectile velocity.

== External-propellant caseless ammunition ==
=== Description ===
Modern caseless ammunition typically uses a configuration in which the primer and projectile gets integrated into a solid mass of external propellant (originally nitrocellulose), cast to form the body of the cartridge. Cavities exist in the body to accept the bullet and a primer (both of which are glued into place). The completed cartridge might also contain a booster charge of powdered propellant to help ignite the body and provide initial thrust to the bullet. Many of these external-propellant caseless cartridges are also telescoped, with the bulk of the bullet held within the body of the cartridge, to cut down on cartridge length. A shorter cartridge cuts down on the distance the firearm&#x27;s action must reciprocate to load a new round, which allows for higher cyclic rates and greater probability of multiple hits on a target at long range. Lack of a case also reduces the weight of the cartridge substantially, especially in small bore rifles. For example, the external-propellant caseless ammunition designed by Austrian inventor Hubert Usel (1926–2010) for the Voere VEC-91 weighs about one third as much as regular ammunition for the same caliber.

=== Issues ===
While it seems a simple operation to replace the case with a piece of solid propellant, the cartridge case provides more than just a way to keep the cartridge components together, and these other functions must be replaced if the case is to be replaced. External-propellant caseless ammunition is not without its drawbacks, and it is these drawbacks that have kept modern external-propellant caseless ammunition from achieving wider success.

==== Heat sensitivity ====
The first major problem, of special concern in military applications, which often involve sustained firing, is the heat sensitivity of the ammunition. Nitrocellulose, the primary component of modern firearm propellant, ignites at a relatively low temperature of around 170 °C (338 °F). One of the functions of the metallic cartridge case is as a heat sink; when extracted after firing, every metallic case carries away a significant amount of the heat from the combustion of the propellant, slowing the rate at which heat builds up in the chamber. The thermal insulation provided by the case also works the other way around, shielding the propellant from built-up heat in the chamber walls.

Without a case to provide these functions, external-propellant caseless rounds using nitrocellulose will begin to cook off, firing from the residual chamber heat, much sooner than cased cartridges do. Cooking off can be avoided by designing the weapon to fire from an open bolt, but this introduces other problems, and thus is only suitable for smaller-calibre machine guns and submachine guns.

The normal solution to the problem of heat is to increase the heat resistance by switching to a propellant with a higher ignition temperature, typically a non-crystalline explosive carefully formulated to provide an appropriate rate of combustion. Heckler &amp; Koch, in concert with Dynamit Nobel, managed such a task by producing relatively heat-resistant external-propellant caseless ammunition.

==== Sealing ====
Another important function provided by the cartridge is to seal the rear of the chamber. During firing of a cased cartridge, the pressure in the chamber expands the metallic case, which obturates to the chamber. This prevents gas exiting from the rear of the chamber, and it has also been experimentally shown to provide a significant amount of support to the bolt. Without the case to provide this seal, the firearm design must account for this and provide a means of sealing the rear of the chamber. This problem was also encountered with the Dreyse needle gun; the French Chassepot solved the leaking-breech problem with the addition of a rubber seal to the bolt.

Telescoped external-propellant caseless rounds must also deal with the issue of blocking the bore, as the bullet is surrounded by propellant. The booster charge is used to address this issue, providing an initial burst of pressure to force the bullet out of the cartridge body and into the barrel before the body combusts.

==== Fragility ====
External-propellant caseless rounds are limited by the fact that the cartridge body is primarily a propellant, and structural properties are secondary to the combustion properties. The primary issue is one of extraction. While caseless ammunition eliminates the need to extract a fired case, unfired caseless rounds must be extractable to unload the firearm or to clear a misfire. With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a rim or extractor groove machined into the rear of the case. Even in completely plastic-bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor. A secondary issue is that ammunition in use can be exposed to air, water, lubricants, and solvents. Primer and propellant in external-propellant caseless rounds is unprotected, while cartridge cases provide a high degree of protection.

=== External-propellant caseless guns ===
One of the first caseless firearm and ammunition systems produced was made by Daisy, the airgun maker, in 1968. The Daisy V/L rifle uses a .22 caliber (5.5 mm) low-powered external-propellant caseless round with no primer. The rifle was basically a spring-piston air rifle, but when used with the V/L ammunition the energy from the compression of the piston heated the air behind the caseless cartridge enough to ignite the propellant, and this generated the bulk of the energy of firing. The Daisy V/L rifle system was discontinued in 1969 after the ATF ruled that it was not an airgun, but a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce.

Some assault rifles have used external-propellant caseless ammunition. One of the better-known weapons of this type is the G11 made by Heckler &amp; Koch as a potential replacement for the G3 battle rifle. Although the G11 never entered full production, it went through a number of prototype stages as well as field testing, including testing as part of the American Advanced Combat Rifle program. While it was scheduled to be adopted by the West German military with a plan set out to procure 300,000 G11K2 rifles over a period from 1990 to 2002, the expenses created by the reunification of Germany and the impossibility of modifying the G11 to use NATO-standard ammunition led to the cancellation of the G11 project and the adoption of a cheaper, more conventional NATO-standardised assault rifle, the 5.56mm G36. The G11&#x27;s caseless ammunition was later used as the basis for the caseless round development in the US Lightweight Small Arms Technologies program.

The first commercial external-propellant caseless rifle featuring electronic firing was the Voere VEC-91.

<text>Jack Steven Irons (born July 18, 1962) is an American drummer. He is the founding drummer of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers until he departed in 1988 and is a former member of Pearl Jam and Eleven.

Alongside his work with Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam, Irons has been a member of Eleven, The Wallflowers and Mark Lanegan Band. He has worked with Joe Strummer and The Latino Rockabilly War, Redd Kross, Raging Slab, Spinnerette and The Les Claypool Frog Brigade. In 1995 Irons and the other members of Pearl Jam recorded and toured the &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; album with Neil Young. Irons has released two solo albums, &quot;Attention Dimension&quot; (2004) and &quot;No Heads Are Better Than One&quot; (2010).

Irons was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2012. Irons, along with former drummer Cliff Martinez, joined the band onstage for the first time in 24 years for a performance of their 1991 hit &quot;Give It Away&quot;. Irons was an opening act in 2017 for the Chili Peppers on The Getaway World Tour.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Jack Irons was born and raised in Los Angeles. He is from a Jewish background. Irons grew up using his family&#x27;s cutlery as drumsticks, playing along to whatever was on the radio. He talked his parents into buying him a drum set, and took a drum class. Irons attended Bancroft Jr. High School in Hollywood, where he met future bandmates Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary and Hillel Slovak. He then went on to attend Fairfax High School in Los Angeles alongside Balzary and Slovak, as well as future bandmates Anthony Kiedis and Alain Johannes. He and Slovak were both fans of Kiss, and they formed a tribute act. Irons was influenced by Jack DeJohnette, Stewart Copeland, and Keith Moon.

===What Is This? and The Red Hot Chili Peppers===
As teenagers, Irons, Johannes, Slovak, and schoolmate Todd Strassman formed the band Chain Reaction in 1976. After its first gig, the band renamed itself Anthym. Slovak, dissatisfied with Strassman&#x27;s bass playing, taught friend Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary to play then replaced Strassman with Flea. After graduating high school, the band changed its name to What Is This? after a question often asked by people who heard the band play. Flea soon departed to play bass in the prominent Los Angeles punk band Fear. What Is This? continued, performing many shows along the California coast.

In 1983, Flea formed a &quot;one-off&quot; band, Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, with Kiedis, Slovak and Irons. Their performance was a hit and, after deciding to continue past the single concert, they changed their name to Red Hot Chili Peppers, quickly gaining popularity around Los Angeles. After six months, they earned a record deal with EMI and prepared to record its first album. Since What Is This? had signed a record deal two weeks earlier and Slovak and Irons considered the Red Hot Chili Peppers a side project, they quit. With What Is This?, Irons recorded 1984&#x27;s &quot;Squeezed (EP)&quot;, 1985&#x27;s &quot;3 Out of 5 Live&quot; EP, and a full-length self-titled album that same year. The band broke up following the album&#x27;s recording as Slovak became frustrated with the band and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In the meantime, Irons played on several recordings by Walk the Moon, a duo made up of Johannes and Natasha Shneider. In 1986, after learning that drummer Cliff Martinez had resigned, Irons returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Irons played drums on the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; first demo tape and their third album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;. When Slovak died of a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988, Irons again quit the band because he did not want to be part of a group where his friends were dying. In 2006, Irons said Slovak&#x27;s death had been such a huge shock that he had been suffering from depression ever since.

On August 12, 2012, Irons and Martinez performed &quot;Give It Away&quot; with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at a Los Angeles concert. In 2017, Irons was an opening act for several dates on &quot;The Getaway World Tour&quot;.

===Eleven===

After Irons left Red Hot Chili Peppers, he went to a psychiatric hospital to receive treatment. After a brief stint with Joe Strummer&#x27;s backing band the Latino Rockabilly War, Irons teamed up with Johannes and Shneider in 1990 to form Eleven. With Eleven, Irons recorded the albums &quot;Awake in a Dream&quot; (1991) and &quot;Eleven&quot; (1993). Midway through the recording of Eleven&#x27;s third album, &quot;Thunk&quot; (1995), Irons left to drum with Pearl Jam, and Matt Cameron of Soundgarden played drums on the album&#x27;s remaining four tracks. Irons returned to the band once again in 2002 prior to the recording of the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Howling Book&quot; (2003). Shneider died on July 2, 2008, following a battle with cancer. Prior to Shneider&#x27;s death, the band was working on a sixth album due for release in the fall of 2008.

===Pearl Jam===

Bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard invited Irons to join Mookie Blaylock, the band that became Pearl Jam, in 1990, when the band was first forming and still looking for a singer and a drummer. Although he did not join the band at that time because he was committed to Eleven, he did pass on a cassette of the band&#x27;s work to a singer and local musician in San Diego named Eddie Vedder. Irons had formed a friendship with Vedder after meeting him through the Southern California music scene and played basketball with him. Vedder subsequently joined the band. Irons also called the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1991 and asked the band to allow Vedder&#x27;s new group to open for the band on its forthcoming &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; tour.

Irons became the drummer for Pearl Jam in late 1994 following the firing of drummer Dave Abbruzzese. His first recording with the band was &quot;Hey Foxymophandlemama, That&#x27;s Me&quot; for &quot;Vitalogy&quot; (1994). Gossard said, &quot;Jack entered the band right at the end of making &quot;Vitalogy&quot;. Jack&#x27;s a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.&quot; Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young&#x27;s 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band&#x27;s new drummer until its 1995 &quot;Self-Pollution&quot; satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long &quot;pirate&quot; broadcast out of Seattle, Washington which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it. Irons joined the group and played Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting the &quot;Vitalogy&quot; album.

Irons performed with other members of Pearl Jam on Neil Young&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, and subsequently toured Europe as part of Young&#x27;s backing band. Talking about the album, Young called drummer Irons &quot;unbelievable.&quot; He stated that he &quot;played his ass off on every take at every session,&quot; and added, &quot;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about him.&quot;

With Irons, Pearl Jam recorded its fourth studio album, &quot;No Code&quot;, released in 1996, for which Irons also toured. The band subsequently released &quot;Yield&quot; in 1998. &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. As a member of Pearl Jam, Irons brought a unique drumming style to the band, particularly in the way he played his fills and with his use of a trash can lid as a cymbal. Irons co-wrote the music for the &quot;No Code&quot; songs &quot;Who You Are&quot;, &quot;In My Tree&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Open&quot;. He also wrote and sang on the Pearl Jam songs &quot;Happy When I&#x27;m Crying&quot; (from the 1997 fan club Christmas single), &quot;●&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;), and &quot;Whale Song&quot; (from the 1999 &quot;Music for Our Mother Ocean Vol. 3&quot; compilation). He played with Pearl Jam through March 20, 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam&#x27;s sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, &quot;We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn&#x27;t in a position to carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don&#x27;t know if he thought they&#x27;d put things on hold for him.&quot; Vedder said, &quot;I think that him deciding that he wasn&#x27;t going to be in the band really hurt.&quot; Coincidentally, Matt Cameron, from the recently split Soundgarden, replaced him again as he did four years prior on Eleven&#x27;s &quot;Thunk&quot;.

==Other musical projects==

===&quot;Attention Dimension&quot;===

On September 7, 2004, Irons released a solo album called &quot;Attention Dimension&quot;. Irons started creating his first pieces of drum music in 1994, but it wasn&#x27;t until fall 1999, about a year after he left Pearl Jam, that he seriously began recording himself for a possible solo album. The album features appearances by former bandmates such as Alain Johannes, Flea, Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, and Les Claypool. Vedder contributed vocals to a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic said, &quot;&quot;Attention Dimension&quot; is the drummer&#x27;s chance to be in the bright white klieg light.&quot;

===Collaborations===
Aside from the aforementioned bands, Irons recorded and toured as a member of Joe Strummer&#x27;s backing band The Latino Rockabilly War for the album &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot; (1989), and also toured with Redd Kross in support of the band&#x27;s album &quot;Third Eye&quot; (1990). He appears in Redd Kross&#x27; promotional video for the song &quot;Annie&#x27;s Gone&quot;. In 1992, Raging Slab (a band notorious for having over 25 different drummers over the course of the band&#x27;s 18-year career), complete with Irons on drums, began recording the follow-up to its 1989 RCA Records self-titled debut, with producer Michael Beinhorn at the helm. The entire album was recorded, mixed, and mastered; however when RCA Records executives heard the album, it was rejected. The album, titled &quot;Freeburden&quot;, remains unreleased. In 2000, Irons played as part of the initial line-up of Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. Irons is featured on the track &quot;Milky Ave&quot; on the album &quot;Ultra Payloaded&quot; (2007) by Perry Farrell&#x27;s band Satellite Party. Joining him on the album is former bandmate Flea. In 2012 he appeared on former Chili Pepper bandmate, Flea&#x27;s debut solo EP &quot;Helen Burns&quot;. Aside from popular music, Irons has worked as a drumming advisor and teacher for numerous U.S. television projects. Irons appeared on five of the ten songs on &quot;To Be One With You&quot;, the debut solo album by former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer who released the album under the name Pluralone. The album was released on November 22, 2019. He then went on to record four songs on Josh&#x27;s follow-up record, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Well&quot; released on October 16, 2020.

==Equipment==
Irons currently endorses Masters of Maple Drums, Zildjian cymbals, and Pro-Mark drumsticks.

==Personal life==
Irons has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. About being diagnosed, he said &quot;back in my twenties they said, &#x27;When you get to your forties you might be able to turn a corner with this kind of a thing&#x27;. And I think that&#x27;s very accurate. I had to learn to decipher sort of what was real and what was in my head. And that took time.&quot;

He is married and has two children. His son, Zach Irons, is founder and lead guitarist for Irontom. In September 2015, Zach Irons became lead guitarist for AWOLNATION.

<doc id="561277" wikidata="Q742407" url="?curid=561277" title="Assist (ice hockey)">
<text>In ice hockey, an assist is attributed to up to two players of the scoring team who shot, passed or deflected the puck towards the scoring teammate, or touched it in any other way which enabled the goal, meaning that they were &quot;assisting&quot; in the goal. There can be a maximum of two assists per goal. The assists will be awarded in the order of play, with the last player to pass the puck to the goal scorer getting the primary assist and the player who passed it to the primary assister getting the secondary assist. Players who gain an assist will get one point added to their player statistics. When a player scores a goal or is awarded a primary or secondary assist, they will be given a point. The leader of total points throughout an NHL season will be awarded the Art Ross trophy.
Despite the use of the terms &quot;primary assist&quot; and &quot;secondary assist&quot;, neither is worth more than the other, and neither is worth more or less than a goal. An assist is awarded to the player or players (maximum of two) who touched the puck prior to the goal, provided no defender plays or possesses the puck in between. Assists and goals are added together on a player&#x27;s scoresheet to display that player&#x27;s total points.

Although there are different rulebooks present for all countries that participate in the national level, the awarding of an assist point is universal. Based on the Hockey Canada rulebook, Rule 6.6 Goals and Assists Hockey Canada; &quot;Each goal and assist will count one point in the scoring records. A maximum of two assists will be credited on any one goal.&quot; There are also specifics that must be considered on certain assist points, such as assists on rebound shots. According to the USA Hockey Officiating Rulebook, A1 shoots the puck which hits the  and rebounds out to teammate A2.  A2 then shoots the puck into the goal. Does the  who took the initial shot (A1) deserve an assist? Yes. Rule Reference 617(a). In the case of a rebound, only one assist can be given to the  who took the original shot. 

==Special cases==
If a player scores off a rebound given up by a goaltender, assists are still awarded, as long as there is no re-possession by that goaltender i.e. they did not gain complete control of the puck.

However, a rule says that only one point can be credited to any one player on a goal scored. This means one player cannot be credited with a goal and an assist for the same goal scored; instead the player would only get credit for a goal and a different player may get credit for an assist, if applicable. It also means that one player cannot be credited with two assists for the same goal scored; instead the player would only get credit for one assist and a different player may get credit for the other assist, if applicable.

Additionally, if a player passes the puck to another player who then completes a give-and-go with a different player for a goal, the player who made the pass that set up the goal gets the primary assist, and the player who passed to the eventual goal scorer before the give-and-go took place gets the secondary assist. This is essentially because assists are to be awarded to the last (up to) two players of the scoring team who had possession of the puck before the eventual goal scorer had possession and ultimately scored, regardless of whether that eventual goal scorer had possession at any time in between the two other players. This also means that possession of the puck can go from and in between the eventual goal scorer and eventual assist getters an unlimited number of times, and this scoring standard will still be applied.

<text>WCNC-TV (channel 36) is a television station in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, affiliated with NBC. The station is owned by Tegna Inc. WCNC-TV&#x27;s studios are located in the Wood Ridge Center office complex off Billy Graham Parkway (Route 4), just east of the Billy Graham Library in south Charlotte, and its transmitter is located in north-central Gaston County.

Channel 36 was established as WCTU-TV, an independent television station, in 1967. After falling into receivership brought on by severe economic hardship, WCTU was purchased by Atlanta broadcast pioneer Ted Turner. Renamed WRET-TV, the station&#x27;s fortunes turned around and thrived throughout the 1970s. WRET became Charlotte&#x27;s NBC affiliate in 1978 following WSOC-TV&#x27;s switch from NBC to ABC, launching local newscasts. Turner sold WRET to Westinghouse Broadcasting in 1979 to raise capital for his new venture CNN; as WPCQ-TV, the station struggled with limited resources, frequently preempting NBC fare—including the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;—and was used to develop talent for other stations in the Group W chain. Spun off to local ownership in 1984, WPCQ&#x27;s status with NBC remained uncertain despite substantial technical upgrades and a reinvestment in local news. Purchased by The Providence Journal Company in 1988, the Belo Corporation in 1996, and Tegna Inc. predecessor Gannett in 2013, the station was renamed WCNC-TV in 1989 and has generally been Charlotte&#x27;s third-rated television station since.

==History==

===Prior use of channel 36 in Charlotte===

The first station to operate on UHF channel 36 in Charlotte signed on the air January 5, 1954, as WAYS-TV; that station was sold and changed its call letters to WQMC-TV on January 24, 1955. Charlotte&#x27;s second television station, WAYS-TV/WQMC-TV did not make any headway against WBTV (channel 3) because television set manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability at the time; this would not change until Congress passed the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1961. It ceased operations in March 1955. A plan to return it to the air as WUTV under reconstituted ownership in 1957 was unsuccessful, but it aired educational programming from 1961 to 1963. Cy Bahakel bought the station in 1964 and returned it to the air as WCCB, which broadcast on channel 36 before moving to UHF channel 18 in November 1966.

===Charlotte Telecasters era===
The current incarnation of channel 36 signed on the air on July 9, 1967, as WCTU-TV. Dr. Harold W. Twisdale, a dentist from Charlotte, and Washington, D.C.–based engineer David L. Steel were the leaders of the original ownership group, operating as Charlotte Telecasters Inc. (The station had intended to take the call letters WCTI, but citing potential confusion, local educational station WTVI successfully objected; the U stood for UHF.) WCTU was North Carolina&#x27;s first independent station, beating Hickory-based WHKY-TV (channel 14) to the air by eight months.

Twisdale and Steel were the lead investors in other planned UHF stations; though construction permits were never built for stations in Memphis and Richmond and the group lost out on channel 28 in Durham, WCTU-TV and WATU-TV (later WAGT) in Augusta, Georgia, made it to air. WATU-TV was a profitable operation; in comparison, debts incurred in starting WCTU-TV would prompt Twisdale to shelve his Memphis and Richmond plans.

WCTU was initially a low-budget independent station operating about eight hours a day from 3 to 11 p.m. It ran a lineup of some very old movies, westerns, some comedy shows from the early 1950s, and public affairs shows. The station, which operated from studios on Hood Road in the Hickory Grove neighborhood of Charlotte, had very modern equipment for the time and broadcast some shows and movies in color, as well as all of its local programming in color.

The station hit hard times financially in 1969. In July, equipment supplier Ampex filed two lawsuits seeking $1.3 million from WCTU-TV for failing to pay for products it had purchased from them. Film distributor National Telefilm Associates had also sued channel 36 for $80,000 for breaching a film rental contract. That September, a court placed WCTU into receivership, though it continued to broadcast. Stating that &quot;we feel there have been combined forces which hinder our operation&quot;, Twisdale foreshadowed a years-long antitrust case against the Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, owner of WBTV, which was not fully dismissed until 1977.

===The Turner turnaround===

Channel 36 found a buyer in February 1970: Atlanta broadcasting mogul Ted Turner, who purchased WCTU through Turner Broadcasting of North Carolina for $1.25 million. Turner had scouted out buying equipment from the bankrupt station but decided instead to buy the whole operation. At the time, he owned just one other television property, WJRJ-TV in his hometown Atlanta, as well as three radio stations in other southeastern cities. Turner renamed the station WRET-TV—using the initials of his full name, Robert Edward Turner III—in July and instituted a new and expanded program lineup in August. Just two programs, wrestling and the music video program &quot;The Now Explosion&quot;, were retained.

Turner&#x27;s new Charlotte station was not an immediate success. Programming costs were high relative to ratings. The station had just one on-air personality: announcer Bob Chesson, who as &quot;Dead Ernest&quot; hosted the station&#x27;s block of horror films. One Saturday morning in February 1972, Turner appeared on the station to appeal for contributions from viewers, saying that channel 36 had not broken even since he had purchased it. The station drew $53,000 in donations, enough to help pay its bills, and also received interest from several new advertisers. WRET-TV became a typical UHF independent, airing a lineup of cartoons, sitcoms, older movies, and a heavy slate of sporting events. It was among the early carriers of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, produced by the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN); CBN founder Pat Robertson, who like Turner had gone to Brown University, read about the appeal for donations in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and placed his programs on the station. At one point, the Charlotte area accounted for 15 percent of CBN&#x27;s pledge contributions. CBN programming was dropped by WRET in 1973 and replaced with programs of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, headed locally by Jim Bakker; the shows included &quot;The PTL Club&quot;. Bakker split from TBN in 1974 and moved his staff to Charlotte.

By 1975, buoyed by a stronger film library, WRET-TV had emerged as the country&#x27;s fifth-best independent station of 65 nationwide in audience share, per an analysis by &quot;Television/Radio Age&quot;, and was making a profit. After five years of being independently operated from the rest of his Turner Communications Group, that company absorbed WRET-TV and its parent company later that year. Late that year, Turner was making plans to uplink one of its two stations nationwide for distribution to cable providers. While Turner preferred to uplink his Atlanta flagship, by then renamed, WRET-TV was a backup in the event that the Federal Communications Commission did not relax rules that prevented the existence of superstations in top-25 television markets. Channel 36 ended the year by announcing plans to repay the viewers whose contributions had saved it four years prior, doing so in February 1976. Each of the 3,600 contributors, who had sent in from 25 cents to $200, received checks returning their money—with interest—from Turner.

In 1976 and 1977, channel 36 became an even more aggressive buyer of programming, grabbing local rights to &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; from WSOC-TV and stepping in to run CBS coverage of NBA basketball when WBTV passed on the package; it also aired other network shows that Charlotte&#x27;s affiliates preempted. It was airing on 148 cable systems in the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia. However, WRET-TV remained a laggard in news and public affairs programming. Its 15-minute sign-off newscast—the only such program on the station as an independent—was read by Bill Tush from Turner&#x27;s headquarters in Atlanta and fed to Charlotte by telephone.

===From independent to NBC affiliate===
In 1977, ABC announced that it had lured longtime NBC affiliate WSOC-TV to be its new outlet in the Charlotte market beginning July 1, 1978, replacing WCCB-TV. That decision set off a two-station showdown between WCCB and WRET for the NBC affiliation in Charlotte. WCCB was seen as the favorite; unlike WRET, it had a functioning news department. Sources at NBC were said to see channel 36 as their last option behind WCCB, with its stronger signal, and long-dominant WBTV, which the network was trying to woo from CBS to no avail.

Turner, however, promised NBC that he would spend $2.5 million on station improvements if the network moved its programming to WRET. Of that total, $1 million would go towards starting a full scale news department within one year; the proposed expansion would employ 22 people, compared to 26 at WSOC and 12 at WCCB. On April 29, news broke that channel 36 had been selected for the NBC affiliation, with the network preferring it over WCCB based on Turner&#x27;s turnaround record with the station and his ownership of the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks. With the decision, WCCB became an independent station.

Two months after assuming the NBC affiliation, WRET launched its first newscasts in September, under the banner of &quot;Action News&quot;; Robert D. Raiford was the station&#x27;s first news anchor. The main news was presented at 7 p.m., but the different time slot failed to attract viewers. Where WBTV had a 52 share and WSOC a 23 for their 6 p.m. newscasts, WRET could only pull a 5. Bob Wisehart of the &quot;Charlotte News&quot; described WRET&#x27;s news operation as &quot;spend[ing] a great deal of effort going no place at all&quot;. The same could have been said of the station, which was said to be barely breaking even after the switch.

===Group W era===
Turner&#x27;s ambitious and mostly successful ownership of the station would not last much longer after obtaining the NBC affiliation. By 1979, Turner was in the process of starting CNN, and he announced he would sell channel 36 to help raise the capital needed for the new venture. On May 16, 1979, the sale of WRET-TV to Westinghouse Broadcasting (also known as Group W) was announced for $20 million, setting a then-record for a single UHF television station. The news of a purchase by Group W, owner of regarded television and radio stations in other cities, was initially met with glee by the WRET-TV staff. Two station employees who had been looking for new jobs elsewhere decided to stay when the sale was announced. In 1984, Reese Schonfeld, who co-founded CNN with Turner, would note that by providing the collateral against which Turner obtained money for CNN in the WRET-TV purchase, Westinghouse financed the start of CNN and then of its own short-lived Satellite News Channel two years later.

Final approval of the sale was secured at the end of April 1980, when Westinghouse agreed to furnish $400,000 in grants and affirmative action programs in exchange for the withdrawal of a license renewal challenge by local civil rights groups; the Federal Communications Commission did find in their favor when it said the station did not employ enough minorities, renewing WRET-TV&#x27;s license for a half-term of 18 months. Some of the funds went to improve the journalism school at the historically Black Johnson C. Smith University.

Westinghouse changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WPCQ-TV, representing &quot;People of the Carolinas and Queen City&quot;, on September 29; the station rebranded as &quot;Q36&quot; to go with the callsign change. The move came alongside a major programming reshuffle and an increase in effective radiated power from 1.3 to 2.5 million watts. The newscasts were moved from 6 and 11 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., and several new magazine shows were added, as was a Friday night public service-concept game show called &quot;Quibble&quot;, which was soon demoted to Saturdays. The early newscast was then moved back to 6 p.m., but WCCB, airing reruns of &quot;Good Times&quot;, drew 13 percent of the audience in May 1982 compared to the 2 percent that watched the WPCQ-TV newscast; the station was, again, losing money. Westinghouse&#x27;s inability to make channel 36 more competitive surprised even local rivals, who had expected the company to do more with the station.

In August 1982, the station made another programming change, this time attracting considerable national attention: it dropped its low-rated early evening newscast. When it axed that program, it also decided to cease carrying the &quot;NBC Nightly News.&quot; This prompted NBC officials to shop the &quot;Nightly News&quot; to Charlotte&#x27;s other stations, including WBTV. The station continued with its noon newscast, as well as short news capsules throughout the day and occasional news specials. Station officials blamed WPCQ-TV&#x27;s signal, which—despite the power increase—was not strong enough to reach outer areas of the market that got better signals from WXII-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina. John J. Spinola, the general manager of the station, admitted that he was &quot;pretty well encircled by NBC affiliates&quot;.
&quot;Q36&quot; became known for frequent preemptions of NBC network fare, including the soap opera &quot;Texas&quot;, coverage of the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and network sporting events. It also delayed the David Brinkley-hosted &quot;NBC Magazine&quot; to midnight to air its own &quot;Action News Magazine&quot;. Even Westinghouse&#x27;s own productions were not guaranteed an audience on the station; after two years of WPCQ-TV airing &quot;Hour Magazine&quot;, it moved to WBTV in 1982.

Seeing little positive progress with WPCQ-TV, Westinghouse soon chose to use the station&#x27;s low expectations to their advantage elsewhere in the company. Westinghouse had long extensively promoted from within and thus used WPCQ as the equivalent of a &quot;farm team&quot; for its larger stations. Its more promising on-air personalities merely treated WPCQ as a stepping stone towards promotion to Group W&#x27;s well-regarded heritage radio and television stations outside Charlotte, such as when sports director Lou Tilley moved to Boston to become the weekend sports anchor at WBZ-TV. Amanda Davis, who had anchored the news three years for WPCQ-TV, became a correspondent for Group W&#x27;s Satellite News Channel after turning down an offer to report for its Baltimore station, WJZ-TV. When a union strike at the company&#x27;s New York City all-news station, WINS, left it without announcers, Westinghouse sent WPCQ anchor Raiford there as part of a team of 20 employees from other Group W stations to keep it running.

===A new Odyssey===
Odyssey Partners, a New York investment partnership headed by Michael Finkelstein, acquired WPCQ-TV in 1984 after four years of Westinghouse ownership. For Westinghouse, the move was about focusing on major markets and shedding a station that was estimated to have lost $5 million in four years; Charlie Hanna, writing in &quot;Variety&quot; the year before, noted that Westinghouse had seemed to lose its &quot;gung-hoism&quot; for the station. Mark Wolf, television and radio columnist for &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, would note that elements that Group W had used successfully elsewhere had failed to make a dent against two formidable and entrenched competitors in Charlotte, and that the company seemed to lack other ideas when its typical plans did not work.

When the sale closed in February 1985, Odyssey immediately announced the restoration of the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; to the station&#x27;s schedule. Later that year, talk began of the potential return of local newscasts when station general manager Stan Rudick said that channel 36 was conducting market research on the idea. The station had reason to get back in the news game, as Charlotte was being cited as a potential market for NBC to move its affiliation. In February 1986, the station announced it would return to producing evening newscasts.

Following a $2 million investment, 5:30 and 11 p.m. news programs began airing September 8, 1986, anchored by former Atlanta newsman John McKnight and Karen Adams. Ratings were low but exceeded the levels of Action News in the Group W era. The original &quot;36 News&quot; early evening newscast expanded to an hour and became &quot;News 36&quot; in May 1988 in what amounted to a soft reboot of the operation. The revamp brought a string of new faces, notably including weekend sports anchor Hannah Storm.

Odyssey also implemented a technical overhaul for WPCQ-TV. In 1987, the station bought land north of Dallas to build a new tower near those owned by WBTV and newly built WJZY and filed to increase power to the maximum 5 million watts. After surviving an attempt by NBC to move its affiliation from channel 36, in which NBC attempted to court both Charlotte VHF stations and the new WJZY, the new tower and stronger signal were activated in September 1988, giving WPCQ-TV signal parity with other Charlotte stations.

===Providence Journal===
The Providence Journal Company (ProJo) purchased WPCQ-TV in 1988 for $30 million, marking its fourth television station purchase. ProJo immediately set out to build a new identity for the station. After initially pursuing the call letters WPJB-TV, formerly used by the &quot;Journal&quot;″s Providence radio stations, the station instead became WCNC-TV (for &quot;Charlotte, North Carolina&quot;) on September 3, 1989. That same day, the station split its 5:30 p.m. news hour into two half-hour newscasts, and it also moved to cable channel 6 on most area systems. The station also built new studios, costing $6.5 million, on Billy Graham Parkway in the Wood Ridge office complex, where it would be joined by the new headquarters of the NBC News Channel affiliate service, which general manager John Hayes had successfully lured to Charlotte. ProJo also sprung for a new satellite truck, the only one in the market, and overnight ratings for the Charlotte market. The early months of &quot;NBC Nightside&quot;, an NBC News Channel production, came from the new WCNC set. Despite all the improvements, WCNC&#x27;s news remained firmly in third.

Beginning in 1996, the station was branded on-air as &quot;NBC 6&quot;, in reference to its cable channel location; it quietly shed that moniker to go by its call letters in 2004, seeking to avoid potential confusion in ratings diaries.

===Belo ownership===

In 1996, the Belo Corporation bought the Providence Journal Company. The station suffered from two anchor departures in just over a week in early 1997 as Belo completed the purchase; meanwhile, its newscasts were still in third place. Under new general manager Richard Keilty, WCNC lured Sonja Gantt, formerly of WBTV, back to the market from a stint in Chicago. The station also got a new $200,000 news set as Belo sought to raise the station from its perennial cellar.

The next year, Ray Boylan, a longtime meteorologist at WSOC-TV, unretired and did on-air reports on WCNC, while the station also hired Terri Bennett, who had been in the running to replace him on channel 9 but was passed over. Boylan and Bennett were backed up by the station&#x27;s purchase of a new Doppler radar and other weather equipment. However, not all of the talent changes made were positively received; the ouster of Beatrice Thompson, who had been Charlotte&#x27;s first full-time Black anchor at WBTV in the 1980s, led to protests by some viewers who felt she had been forced out because of her race.

Boylan retired in December 2000. The station showed momentum in local news ratings in the early 2000s, particularly in mornings and at 11, and between 2000 and 2002, it produced a 10 p.m. newscast for WB affiliate WFVT-TV.

On October 30, 2009, WCNC broke the record for most Halloween costume changes during a local news program, with 11 costumes worn by the station&#x27;s anchor team (Jeff Campbell, Colleen Odegaard, and Larry Sprinkle, as well as producer Natalie Ridley) were involved in setting the record during its weekday morning newscast that day.

In 2008, after referring to itself simply with its call letters and using the slogan &quot;Carolinas&#x27; News Connection&quot;, WCNC changed its branding to &quot;NewsChannel 36&quot;, citing its over-the-air channel number and the coming arrival of digital television. In 2012, the station&#x27;s branding was changed once again to &quot;NBC Charlotte&quot;; this time, the reasoning for the change was that few people actually watched the station over-the-air or on satellite on virtual channel 36.

===Gannett/Tegna ownership===
On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo for $1.5 billion. The sale was finalized on December 23. Investments made by Gannett in WCNC after the Belo purchase included the conversion of newscasts to high definition and a new computer system for the newsroom.

On June 29, 2015, Gannett split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WCNC, by that time rebranded back to its call letters, was retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

==Newscasts==

WCNC-TV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces the hour-long entertainment and lifestyle program &quot;Charlotte Today&quot;, which airs weekdays at 11 a.m. and was started in 2010.

After a solid, if low-rated, start under Turner&#x27;s watch, the news department was severely hamstrung by Group W&#x27;s bargain-basement approach to running the station. Group W immediately dropped the station&#x27;s weekend evening newscasts and moved the 11 p.m. newscast to 12:30 a.m. before canceling it altogether in 1981. The early evening newscast was shifted between the 5:30 and 6 p.m. timeslots until the fall of 1982, when it was canceled as well. For the remainder of Group W&#x27;s ownership, the station&#x27;s only remaining local news programming consisted of a half-hour newscast at noon, hourly cut-ins, five-minute local inserts during &quot;Today&quot;, a weekly magazine program, and occasional specials.

After Odyssey Partners bought the station, the noon newscast was discontinued in the spring of 1985. In September 1986, WPCQ relaunched a full-fledged news department. At first, the station scheduled its early-evening newscast for 5:30 p.m., knowing at the time that it could not hope to compete with WBTV and WSOC-TV at 6 p.m. In 1988, WPCQ expanded the 5:30 newscast to one hour and added a 6 p.m. newscast on weekends. After becoming WCNC, the station added a distinct 6 p.m. newscast to the weeknight schedule. Under Belo, the station expanded further into new timeslots in the late 1990s, including a 5 a.m. morning show, unusual at the time.

In 1999, the station&#x27;s news department was chronicled in the five-part PBS documentary series &quot;Local News&quot;. That same year, WCNC entered into a news share agreement with then-Fox affiliate WCCB to take over production of that station&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast, shortly after WSOC-TV ended its agreement to produce the program after WCCB announced it would launch its own news department. After WCCB&#x27;s in-house news operation launched in 2000, WCNC began airing a 10 p.m. newscast on WB affiliate WWWB (channel 55, now WMYT-TV), which ran until the program was canceled due to low ratings in 2002. The station won a Peabody Award in 2003, the first for a Charlotte television station in 27 years, for an investigation into dental care through Medicaid and attracted notice in the market for its award-winning ways.

For much of the 2000s, WCNC had waged a spirited battle with WBTV for second place behind WSOC-TV, though it would later return to a distant third place in most timeslots as the performance of the NBC network in the late 2000s and poor daytime syndicated offerings dragged it down. This continued in the February 2016 sweeps, when its evening newscasts drew barely half the viewership of WBTV.

In late 2005, WCNC debuted the Charlotte market&#x27;s first 4:30 p.m. newscast, creating a two-hour local news block from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. In 2007, the station phased out its longtime &quot;6News&quot; brand and rebranded itself as &quot;WCNC, Carolinas&#x27; News Connection&quot;. In August 2008, it rebranded once again to &quot;NewsChannel 36&quot;, marking the first time in 12 years that WCNC had used its over-the-air channel number in its branding. Beginning in September 2008, WCNC aired news at 4 p.m., with &quot;Judge Judy&quot; at 4:30; in January 2012, the 4 p.m. news expanded to an hour and the noon news shrank from an hour to 30 minutes.

On May 18, 2009, WCNC began broadcasting its local newscasts in 16:9 widescreen standard definition; this change came alongside the revamping of the station&#x27;s on-air news graphics. A conversion to full high definition followed on June 28, 2014.

WCNC-TV was added to Charlotte&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) deployment on WAXN-TV on July 7, 2021. As part of the change, WAXN&#x27;s 64.4 subchannel of Laff was placed on WCNC-TV&#x27;s multiplex, keeping it available in ATSC 1.0 format.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WCNC-TV began digital transmission on November 1, 1999, and shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36, on the official digital transition date of June 12, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, continuing to use virtual channel 36.

WCNC-TV moved its digital signal from channel 22 to channel 24 on September 6, 2019, as part of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation process.

===Translators===
WCNC-TV&#x27;s signal is additionally rebroadcast over the following translators:

* Biscoe: W36FB-D
* Lilesville–Wadesboro: W17EE-D

<doc id="561281" wikidata="Q2707741" url="?curid=561281" title="Secret Treaties">
<text>Secret Treaties is the third studio album by American rock band Blue Öyster Cult, released on April 5, 1974 by Columbia. It features the same band members and production team as their previous album.

The album spent 14 weeks in the US album charts, peaking at No. 53. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 1992.

In 1975, a poll of readers of the British magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; voted &quot;Secret Treaties&quot; the &quot;Top Rock Album of All Time&quot;. In 2010, Rhapsody called it one of the all-time best &quot;proto-metal&quot; albums.

It is the only BÖC album that does not feature a track with lead vocals sung by guitarist Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser. The band also did not write any of the lyrics to the album, handing that duty to producer Sandy Pearlman, rock critic Richard Meltzer and singer Patti Smith.

==Cover art==
The cover, with art by Ron Lesser, depicts the band standing beside and sitting on a German ME 262 fighter aircraft; this scene is inspired by the song of the same name.

While the LP cover has the band name in red (a darker red on the Japanese LP), on the CD it is in lime green.

==Songs==
Lyrics to the lead-off track &quot;Career of Evil&quot; were written by future punk poet Patti Smith, a longtime contributor to the band (and, at the time, girlfriend of BÖC keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Allen Lanier).

A few changes were made to &quot;Career of Evil&quot; on the single version. The vocals are different: only Eric Bloom is heard for most of the song, instead of Bloom and Albert Bouchard singing together. Also, one verse was removed (&quot;Pay me...&quot; to &quot;...kneeling in the rain&quot;). Part of the bridge was changed also, presumably to make the song more acceptable to radio: &quot;do it to your daughter&quot; became &quot;do it like you ought to.&quot; The line &quot;I want your wife to be my baby tonight&quot; was changed to &quot;I want your life to be mine, maybe tonight&quot;.

The transition between the tracks &quot;Harvester of Eyes&quot; and &quot;Flaming Telepaths&quot; is marked by a piece of classical music played on a music box. Members of the band recall that it was something the sound engineer had found on an unlabeled recording, but they could not identify it. The piece and its composer were uncredited on the album. It has since been identified as an excerpt from a waltz by Ion Ivanovici called &quot;Waves of the Danube&quot; (Donauwellen). The source of the original recording remains a mystery.

&quot;Career of Evil&quot; was the inspiration for the title of the 2015 novel of the same name written by J.K. Rowling under the pen name Robert Galbraith.

The compilation &quot;Don&#x27;t Fear the Reaper: The Best of Blue Öyster Cult&quot; contains a version of &quot;Flaming Telepaths&quot; without the music box intro. The original version with the complete sound effects is found on the compilation &quot;Workshop of the Telescopes&quot;.

The psychedelic folk group Espers covers &quot;Flaming Telepaths&quot; on their CD &quot;The Weed Tree&quot; in 2005.

==Release history==
In addition the conventional 2 channel stereo version the album was also released in a 4 channel quadraphonic version on LP record and 8-track tape in 1974. The quad LP release was encoded in the SQ matrix system.

The album was reissued on the Super Audio CD format in 2016 by Audio Fidelity. This edition contains both the stereo and quad mixes.

<text>Rough Trade (1968–1988) was a Canadian rock band centred on singer Carole Pope and multi-instrumentalist Kevan Staples. The band was noted for their provocative lyrics and stage antics; singer Pope often performed in bondage attire, and their 1981 hit &quot;High School Confidential&quot; was one of the first explicitly lesbian-themed Top 40 hits in the world.

==Biography==

===Early years (1968–1979)===
The first iteration of the band was formed in 1968, in Toronto, when Carole Pope (vocals, guitars) and Kevan Staples (keyboards, guitars) began performing in a folk group known as &quot;O&quot;. Their musical partner in this venture was Clive Smith. In 1970, Smith left the group, and Pope and Staples changed their name to &quot;The Bullwhip Brothers&quot;, performing as a largely acoustic duo at Toronto art festivals and at private events. 

In 1973, the band was renamed Rough Trade, and was joined by percussionist Chris Faulkner, bassist Bob Jennings, and drummer Donny McDougal. As would happen frequently going forward, the players supporting Pope and Staples were subject to sometimes wholesale change, and by 1974, the Pope/Staples duo was joined by Hap Roderman, Jane Cessine, Sharon Smith and Marv Kanarek. The band, through their theatrical combination of rock, R&amp;B and raw sexuality (Pope often performed in bondage attire), became a popular draw on Toronto&#x27;s live music scene through their regular shows at Grossman&#x27;s Tavern, in Toronto.

Rough Trade was the first rock band to record a direct to disc album with 1976&#x27;s &quot;Rough Trade Live&quot;, which despite the title, was actually a studio recording. Each side was performed live (without an audience) all the way through, and cut directly to the mastering disc for greater audio fidelity. By this time, the band&#x27;s line-up was Pope, Staples, JoAnn Brooks (vocals, percussion), Rick Gratton (drums), Michael Fonfara (keyboards, arranger), and Peter Hodgson (bass). As would be the case throughout the band&#x27;s entire career, the majority of the album&#x27;s songs were written by Pope and Staples. In the same year, Geoff Travis opened the first Rough Trade record shop in London, reportedly taking the appellation from the band; this eventually led to the formation of the similarly named Rough Trade Records in 1978.

On December 19, 1977, the band presented a newly created live musical called &quot;Restless Underwear&quot;, which co-starred Divine alongside the band (who by this time had added an additional back-up singer, Luci Martin-Keyes). The show, which played at Toronto&#x27;s prestigious Massey Hall, was noted for its outrageous (for the time) sexual satire. However, aside from Pope and Staples, the rest of the band quit after &quot;Restless Underwear&quot; had completed its one-show run in a dispute over payment.

After a six-month layoff, Pope and Staples rebuilt the band, adding David McMorrow, Bucky Berger, Terry Wilkins, Bert Hermiston, Colina Phillips and Betty Richardson to the line-up at various points in 1978 and 1979. The group resumed playing regular Toronto shows, most often at the Horseshoe Tavern. In 1978, Tim Curry would issue a cover of the Rough Trade song &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, from their 1976 direct to disc album. Pope and Staples were also at the time involved in writing music for film and television soundtracks, and in 1978 they picked up a Genie Award for their work on the made-for-TV film &quot;One Night Stand&quot;.

On February 14, 1980, the band performed their musical revue &quot;Restless Underwear&quot; at Manhattan&#x27;s Beacon Theatre. However, the event was promoted by the venue as a show by Divine, who in fact only sang two songs in the revue, both in act two. As a result, the show was received poorly. Later that year, the band line-up was again reshuffled, settling into a stable five-person line-up of Carole Pope (vocals), Kevan Staples (guitars, keyboards, etc.), David McMorrow (keyboards), Terry Wilkins (bass) and Bucky Berger (drums). The band also performed in the Canadian horror film, &quot;Deadline&quot;, that same year.
===Commercial peak (1980–1983)===
The new iteration of Rough Trade landed a record contract with True North Records in mid-1980, and recorded the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Avoid Freud&quot;, which was released in October 1980. The official first single was the deliberately controversial &quot;What&#x27;s the Furor About the Fuhrer?&quot;, but radio stations flipped the single over and the B-side &quot;Fashion Victim&quot; became a top 40 hit in Canada.

The controversy surrounding the raunchy lesbian-themed second single &quot;High School Confidential&quot; helped propel the song into the Canadian top 20, and made the band stars. The band sang this song on a notable 1981 appearance on &quot;SCTV&quot;, a prominent Canadian comedy show that also aired in the U.S.

The band&#x27;s next album was 1981&#x27;s &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot;. (The title was originally meant to be &quot;For Those Who Think Jung&quot;, a play on their earlier &quot;Avoid Freud&quot; LP as well as a reference to Carl Jung.) Although not as widely remembered as &quot;High School Confidential&quot; today, the LP&#x27;s first single, the sexually charged &quot;All Touch&quot;, was the band&#x27;s most successful single on the Canadian charts during their career, peaking at no. 12. The release of both &quot;All Touch&quot; and its parent album was delayed by nearly a year in international markets, with &quot;All Touch&quot; peaking in Australia at no. 40 in January 1983 and spending 40 weeks in the Top 100. &quot;All Touch&quot; also became Rough Trade&#x27;s only U.S. chart hit, peaking at no. 58 in early 1983. Although the song widely was believed to have the potential to break into the top 40, the bankruptcy of the band&#x27;s American distributor Boardwalk Records halted its progress on the charts as the single ceased to be available in stores.

During the recording of Rough Trade&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Shaking the Foundations&quot;, Wilkins and Berger left and were replaced by Howard Ayee (bass) and Jorn Anderson (drums) as unofficial members. (By this point, the group was explicitly identified in the album credits as simply Pope and Staples, augmented by other musicians as needed on a track-by-track basis.) &quot;Shaking the Foundations&quot; spawned a top 20 Canadian hit in &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;. Dusty Springfield sang backing vocals on the album, and would also cover two Rough Trade songs that same year on her album &quot;White Heat&quot;. Many years later, Pope would reveal that she and Springfield were in a relationship around this time.

In 1983, Rough Trade were offered a Pepsi commercial to air in the Canadian market, but the ad was soon pulled from the airwaves as Pepsi had featured people wrapped in bandages and wearing tuxedos and sunglasses similar to Canadian musician Nash the Slash without his permission. The same year, lead singer Pope duetted with Paul Hyde on the Payola$ top 10 Canadian hit &quot;Never Said I Loved You&quot;. However, Rough Trade&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Weapons&quot; failed to place a single on the Canadian charts, marking the beginning of the group&#x27;s commercial decline.

On &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, Martin Short recalled that one of his early performances included being the opening act for Rough Trade in the early 1980s.

===Winding down (1984–1988)===
In 1984, the duo of Pope and Staples were paired with new producer Terry Brown, after having previously co-produced all their True North material with Gene Martynec. The duo was supported by session musicians in the studio, including Berger, Wilkins, Ayee, and Anderson, as well as guests such as Dalbello and Neil Chapman of Pukka Orchestra. The band&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;O Tempora! O Mores!&quot; spun off two singles that brushed the Canadian top 100, but it would prove to be Rough Trade&#x27;s final full-length original release.

Rough Trade returned to a stable five person line-up in 1985 for performance purposes, with Pope, Staples and Ayee joined by Tony Springer (guitar) and Tony Craig (drums). This line-up would record a handful of new tracks for the 1985 greatest hits compilation &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;. Their final full-scale tour &quot;Deep Six in &#x27;86&quot; took place in 1986, although they performed a few local concert dates in Toronto in 1987 and 1988. Around the same time, guitarist Springer changed his stage name to Wild T and found modest fame as a solo artist in Canada.

===Reunions, solo activity (1989–present)===
After the final break-up in 1988, Rough Trade performed several reunion shows, with varying personnel supporting Pope and Staples. The first reunion show was in Toronto in December 1994. A handful of one-off shows later took place at various times through the late 1990s and into the next decade, mostly in Toronto. In 1999, playwright Bryden MacDonald staged &quot;Shaking the Foundations&quot;, a musical revue based on Rough Trade&#x27;s music at Toronto&#x27;s Buddies in Bad Times theatre. In 2001, Rough Trade undertook a mini-tour of several venues in eastern Canada.

Since the break-up, Staples has busied himself as a composer for film, television and theatre, and still lives in Toronto. Pope has issued two EPs, two albums, and several singles; her first full-length solo debut album &quot;Transcend&quot; was released in 2005, 21 years after her last full-length album with Rough Trade, which was followed by her second album, Landfall, which was released in 2011. Pope continues to play occasional shows across Canada and in Los Angeles and New York City, and now lives in West Hollywood.

On March 7, 2019, JoAnn Brooks, member of the band from 1976 to 1977, died from health complications.

In 2020, Pope and Staples reunited as Rough Trade to record and issue a new version of &quot;High School Confidential&quot;. Though billed as &quot;High School Confidential (Fame Whore Mix)&quot;, the track was a completely new recording, rather than a remix.

<doc id="561291" wikidata="Q155612" url="?curid=561291" title="Fallen (Evanescence album)">
<text>Fallen is the debut studio album by American rock band Evanescence, released on March 4, 2003, by Wind-up Records. Co-founders singer and pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody began writing and recording songs as Evanescence in 1994, and after releasing two EPs and a demo CD, they signed to Wind-up in January 2001. Several of the songs from their earlier independent releases feature on &quot;Fallen&quot;. The album was recorded between August and December 2002 in several studios in California. It is Evanescence&#x27;s only studio album to feature Moody, who left the band in October 2003.

The album yielded four singles: &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fool&quot;. &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; charted in the top 10 of over 10 countries, including the US, UK and Australia. &quot;Fallen&quot; is Evanescence&#x27;s most commercially successful album to date, selling 10 million copies in the US and over 17 million copies worldwide, making it the sixth best-selling album of the 21st century. It debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 141,000 copies sold in its first week, peaking at number three in June 2003. The album topped the charts in more than 10 countries. It was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in November 2022.

&quot;Fallen&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Evanescence received five nominations at the 46th Grammy Awards: Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song, Best Hard Rock Performance, and Best New Artist, winning the latter two. At the following year&#x27;s ceremony, &quot;My Immortal&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Evanescence embarked on their first headlining concert tour, the &quot;Fallen&quot; Tour, in 2003. A live album and concert DVD with behind the scenes footage was released in 2004, titled &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot;.

==Background==
Lee and Moody met as teenagers in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1994. She brought him a cassette tape of her playing guitar and singing a song she wrote, and they became musical collaborators, playing and working on music at Lee&#x27;s home, and occasionally performing acoustic sets at book stores and coffee houses in the Little Rock area. Lee had a 16-track recorder that she and him would use alongside Pro Tools, &quot;fake strings and choirs&quot; on her keyboard, and layer sounds and beats for their early material, which they mixed and produced. &quot;We were basically just putting it down to remember what we wanted&quot;, Lee said. Lee&#x27;s musical vision for Evanescence was &quot;the idea of combinations that were unlikely&quot;. She aimed to combine her different musical tastes, &quot;bringing something from the cinematic and classical symphonic world and marrying it to metal, hard rock and alternative music.&quot; &quot;There was all this music that was inspiring me. And Evanescence was the product of these two extremes combining&quot;.

They recorded two independent EPs as Evanescence, self-releasing them in the late 1990s. Their early demos got them airplay on the local modern rock station in Little Rock, which helped them develop a local fanbase, allowing them to play a couple of bigger production shows a year and hire other musicians to perform other instruments live. Although they played with guest musicians, Evanescence remained a duo. &quot;The idea of a full band playing these songs was something that only came along later&quot;, Lee said. Moody said that Lee and he were focused on writing music over playing live shows, and they did not want to have a band join their writing process; &quot;we just wanted it to be the two of us and so we&#x27;d play once or twice a year.&quot; They packaged a demo CD, &quot;Origin&quot; (2000), to shop it to record labels, and signed with Wind-up Records in 2001. &quot;Origin&quot; and their earlier EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs that would later appear on &quot;Fallen&quot;.

In a 2004 MTV interview, Moody said that he and Lee rarely wrote together, it was &quot;maybe two or three times in eight years did we actually sit down and write together in the same room.&quot; Lee said that she and Moody never sat down and wrote together, and instead would combine their respective parts in songs. From the start, Lee would only ever write music by herself, considering it a vulnerable process and feeling disrespected by Moody. The creation of &quot;Fallen&quot; largely consisted of her and Moody writing music separately and then adding to each other&#x27;s work, due to tension and significant creative differences between them. Lee&#x27;s creative disagreements with Moody included his strict approach to songwriting and focus on commerciality; he would &quot;always be corralling&quot; her ideas, and wanting to push them in a more commercial, pop direction. She indicated that with Moody there was a &quot;pressure of wanting to rule the world&quot;. &quot;It was always a push and pull between us, for me&quot;, she said. &quot;&quot;Fallen&quot; really is a lot of compromise. It definitely leaned toward what he wanted a lot of the time.&quot; Creative restrictions included instrumentation decisions such as her wanting to play organ on the record and Moody not wanting that. She stated that at one point, all her &quot;pianoplaying rights were stripped away&quot; from her because Moody felt she &quot;was getting too much attention&quot;, so a keyboard player was hired.

Moody said in a 2003 interview that he focused on making the album &quot;as accessible as possible, to as many people as possible&quot;. He later conceded that they had different approaches, adding that Lee is &quot;more creative&quot; and &quot;more educated musically&quot;, and he is &quot;more commercial minded&quot; and likes making &quot;songs people can adhere to.&quot;

Lee expressed that the making of &quot;Fallen&quot; was stressful because &quot;we had to remember [that] at least one big single had to be totally radio-friendly.&quot; In 2006, she said that Moody and the label &quot;packed down and condensed&quot; the original versions of the songs, and she thought that &quot;in some respects, it felt like it was pulling some of the artistic integrity out&quot;. In the early 2020s, Lee recalled the process of making &quot;Fallen&quot; and the obstacles faced: Lee deemed the &quot;fight for credibility&quot; as a creator to be one of the biggest challenges she faced early on, explaining: &quot;It was the mentality of labels to tell, especially newer artists, that they need to have writers. ... And the reason that they wanted [men] to do it was because that&#x27;s where the money was. That&#x27;s where the power was. Everybody else wanted to be able to say they did that when I did that&quot;. She also noted that, for being the frontwoman &quot;people assume that it&#x27;s not yours. And some of the people around me were more than happy to let them believe that.&quot;

In a 2023 retrospective for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Lee stated that there are musical elements &quot;that exist in the way that I hear things in my head that aren&#x27;t in the mix on the album&quot;, such as some string arrangements and electronics. Lee reconciled with the mix of &quot;Fallen&quot; after bringing more of those elements to the forefront with Evanescence&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Synthesis&quot;.

==Writing and musical style==
The album&#x27;s songs were written by Lee and Moody, with Lee the core writer. The two wrote some of the songs when they were 15 and 16. &quot;Imaginary&quot;, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Whisper&quot; were originally from the duo&#x27;s independent recordings in the 1990s. Lee composed some of the songs at her house on her keyboard. She wrote songs alone first on the piano or on acoustic guitar, and for &quot;Fallen&quot; she would write a song and work with Moody to &quot;take it to the finish line.&quot; Lee wrote the album&#x27;s lyrics except &quot;My Immortal&quot;&#x27;s, the melodies, much of the music, pianos, and all the choirs; she is credited with the choral arrangements. Lee also honed in on the string arrangements and electronic elements of the album, some of which are in the background.

Most of Lee&#x27;s writing on &quot;Fallen&quot; was driven by her mindset during a relationship she was in with an abusive man. Lee wrote &quot;Going Under&quot; about &quot;coming out of a bad relationship&quot;. She described the feeling as, &quot;when you&#x27;re at the end of your rope, when you&#x27;re at the point where you realize something has to change, that you can&#x27;t go on living in the situation that you&#x27;re in.&quot; Lee later said that after completing the songs that came out of an abusive relationship, she was listening to her words on &quot;Going Under&quot; and felt that in the chorus she would have liked to have written instead the notion of &quot;I&#x27;m leaving and I&#x27;m not going to put up with this anymore&quot;, thinking to herself &quot;you know what you need to do and you&#x27;re not doing it.&quot; She considered the song the most honest she&#x27;d been lyrically and a statement of standing up for herself, in contrast with &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, which was more of a &quot;cry for help&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; said that the &quot;stop/start cadence&quot; of the guitar, &quot;rippling piano and Lee&#x27;s defiant wail pack a startling wallop&quot;.

Written by Lee when she was 19, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is stylistically a nu metal-rap rock song. The label forced them to add the male rapping vocal, which Lee did not want, after originally demanding they include a rap on eight of the songs on the album. She wrote the song after a then-acquaintance asked her if she was happy, and while in an abusive relationship at the time, she lied in response. The acquaintance seeing through her facade, as she felt she &quot;was completely outwardly acting normal&quot;, inspired her to write the track. The song is about &quot;open-mindedness&quot; and &quot;waking up to all the things you&#x27;ve been missing for so long&quot;, Lee said, realizing that &quot;for months I&#x27;d been numb, just going through the motions of life.&quot; &quot;From the sparkling piano to the epic choruses, to Lee&#x27;s siren call&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; considered &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; &quot;Fallen&quot;″s &quot;definitive track.&quot;

Lee wrote &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fool&quot; in 1999 about the lie of pop stardom life and unrealistic, over-sexualized images that warped the youth&#x27;s expectations. In a VH1 interview, Lee explained that the song came about when her little sister was being influenced by such images. She said it is not about a specific person, but about a collective of the industry that promotes detrimental images and ideals of perfection while &quot;nobody looks like that. It&#x27;s all fake and it&#x27;s really hurting a lot of girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s self images.&quot; Songfacts stated that the song&#x27;s concept &quot;seems like it&#x27;s always relevant&quot;. When asked about it in 2016, Lee said she wrote it as &quot;an angsty teenager&quot; about her &quot;frustration with fakeness&quot; that sprung at the time from all the &quot;bubblegum pop acts&quot; that were &quot;put together like products&quot; influencing young people, including her younger siblings. She said that she also acknowledged that &quot;you never know what&#x27;s going on inside anybody, no matter what they seem like&quot;, and it is a song she has &quot;disconnected&quot; from over the years, adding: 
&quot;My Immortal&quot; is a piano power ballad, with fictional words written by Moody and the music written by Lee on piano when they were 15, after which Lee added the bridge. The version on the album was a demo from 2000 using a MIDI keyboard and Lee&#x27;s vocals as a teen, which the label chose over Lee and Moody&#x27;s re-recording for &quot;Fallen&quot;. During the production of &quot;Fallen&quot;, strings by &quot;Daredevil&quot; composer Graeme Revell were added to the demo recording. The re-recording Lee and Moody made for &quot;Fallen&quot; was used for the single, dubbed &quot;band&quot; version, featuring guitar, drums and bass after the bridge and a new string arrangement by David Campbell.

&quot;Haunted&quot;&#x27;s production emphasizes &quot;feeling overwhelmed by someone’s obsession with you&quot;, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;, with Lee &quot;fighting both being possessed and her desire to give in to it.&quot; Lee wrote the song about fiction, thematically &quot;from the eyes of a killer&quot;. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is a reworked cover of Soul Embraced&#x27;s &quot;My Tourniquet&quot;, co-written by Soul Embraced guitarist and Evanescence tour drummer Rocky Gray. Gray told Lee the song was &quot;coming from a Christian standpoint, but it&#x27;s about suicide. It&#x27;s from the perspective of someone who has just committed suicide and it&#x27;s about the controversy in Christianity that if you commit suicide, will you go to heaven or hell?&quot; Lee wrote the cover&#x27;s melody and added the second verse. The line &quot;I long to die&quot; is from Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Romeo + Juliet, a film Lee was &quot;obsessed&quot; with.

&quot;Imaginary&quot; is a song from Lee and Moody&#x27;s 1998 EP &quot;Evanescence&quot;. Lee wrote it about feeling the need to retreat to her safe haven as a young teen. Some of her lyrics were from poems she wrote as a seventh or eight grader. Lee thought it reflected the core sound of Evanescence at the time, and wanted it to be &quot;Fallen&quot; fourth single. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the combination of Lee&#x27;s lyrics, the piano, &quot;crashing drums&quot; and the Millennial Choir as painting &quot;a picture of the heavens shooting overhead&quot;. The midtempo &quot;Taking Over Mes lyrics are about Lee being consumed by another person&#x27;s obsession with her. Partly inspired by her then-acquaintance and future husband, Lee wrote the song as storytelling from the eyes of a stalker.

Lee wrote &quot;Hello&quot; about her little sister who died of an illness when Lee was six years old. The song is about &quot;a day from that time&quot;. Lee relived those feelings as a teenager and found it &quot;healing&quot; to write about her experience. The song has a &quot;chilled atmosphere&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated, and &quot;relates, from a child’s perspective, the dawning agony of realizing someone is gone forever.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;My Last Breath&quot; imply a struggle for emotional and physical survival. The song was inspired by the loss from 9/11. &quot;Whisper&quot; is originally from Lee and Moody&#x27;s 1999 EP &quot;Sound Asleep&quot;. Driven by guitar and Lee&#x27;s &quot;commanding voice&quot;, it features the &quot;booming&quot; Millennium Choir singing in Latin, ending the album &quot;on a foreboding note&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote.

&quot;Fallen&quot; was regarded as nu metal, gothic rock, gothic metal, and alternative metal, among others. &quot;Loudersound&quot; described it as a bridge between nu metal and both the rising symphonic metal and emo scenes. Lee and Moody said they did not consider their music to be &quot;goth&quot;, with Moody adding that he thinks the &quot;goth&quot; label came because the songs sound sad and people think that &quot;sad equals dark equals Goth. It&#x27;s real easy for them to throw us in that box&quot;. Moody also disliked the nu metal label, stating: &quot;I think the only nu-metal thing about us is the fact that on one song we have rap and singing&quot;. Lee also disagreed with the nu metal tag, attributing it to the rap rock of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;.

== Recording ==
&quot;Fallen&quot; was recorded in California at Track Record Studios, NRG Recording Studios, Ocean Studios, and Conway Recording Studios, beginning at Ocean Studios in Burbank. Recorded and mixed from late August to early December 2002, the album was &quot;built on overdubs&quot; to supplement &quot;the depth of production&quot; that the music involves; &quot;this type of record should be done to where it sounds larger than life&quot;, producer Dave Fortman said. Moody said he didn&#x27;t want the album to &quot;sound too fabricated&quot;. &quot;I love electronics and I love digital manipulation, but I wanted to first establish us as a real rock band. We&#x27;re actually playing all of those parts: The strings are real, the choirs are real, the piano is real.&quot;

Songs were recorded as demos before the recording sessions. Prior to making &quot;Fallen&quot;, they had recorded a demo of &quot;My Immortal&quot; at the radio station where Lee&#x27;s father worked after it was empty late at night; this recording, with Lee&#x27;s teen demo vocals and a MIDI keyboard, is the version used on &quot;Fallen&quot; per the label&#x27;s demand, to Lee&#x27;s displeasure. She stated: Lee later said she also dislikes it because she &quot;sounds like a little kid&quot; and the album version of the song does not use David Campbell&#x27;s orchestration. When &quot;My Immortal&quot; became a single, Lee and Moody chose the recording they originally made for &quot;Fallen&quot;.

Jay Baumgardner lent Moody his guitar gear, including Gibson Les Paul and Gibson SG guitars, Marshall and Mesa Boogie amp heads with an old Mesa Boogie cabinet. Moody said, &quot;It was an old cabinet that was tried-and-true on rock records. It was a no-brainer to use it. I know it was used on Papa Roach and, I think, Staind.&quot; The guitars on the album were recorded at Mad Dog Studios in Burbank. Fortman recorded the guitars through two different amps: Marshall on one side and Mesa/Boogie on the other. &quot;The differences tonally and with the different frequencies in the two different amps really do create a larger stereo feel&quot;, he said. He used two Shure 57 mics and ran them through Neve 1081 preamps directly to Pro Tools.

Lee&#x27;s vocals, recorded on a Neumann U47 tube mic, pianos and the background vocals by the Millennium Choir were recorded at NRG Recording Studios. The string arrangements were done by David Campbell and David Hodges except for &quot;My Immortal&quot;, which had strings added by composer Graeme Revell for the song&#x27;s inclusion in the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack. Campbell contributed orchestral strings, which was an &quot;expense&quot; Lee fought for as did not want synthesized strings. A 22-piece string section was recorded in Seattle, and later mixed at the Newman Scoring Stage and Bolero Studios in Los Angeles. To record the 12-member Millennium Choir&#x27;s voices, Fortman ran a stereo pair of U67s and their voices were then doubled or tripled for a larger sound. In the bridge of &quot;Imaginary&quot;, Fortman said &quot;there are probably 70-plus people performing at that moment&quot;, including &quot;the choir that&#x27;s been doubled, a string orchestra with 22 players doubled, then you add all of the bandmembers, and it&#x27;s huge.&quot;

Drum tracks were recorded at Ocean Studios, with Josh Freese playing on selected songs to a click track, stereo guitars and vocals. Fortman recorded Freese&#x27;s drums with C12As for overheads, Audio-Technica ATM25s on the toms, a D112 on the inside of the kick drum, a U47 on the outside, and an NS-10 speaker as an outside mic. He also used 414 microphones on the ride and hi-hat cymbals. He recorded the drums on two-inch tape on a Studer recorder, and bounced the tracks in Pro Tools.

&quot;Fallen&quot; was mixed over a two-week period at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood, and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City.

Regarding Hodges&#x27; involvement in &quot;Fallen&quot; and his exit from Evanescence thereafter, Moody stated: In another interview, he said that Hodges mostly contributed string arrangements on the album.

== Release and tour==
&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; first appeared in the film &quot;Daredevil&quot; and were included on the , released in February 2003. &quot;Fallen&quot; was released on March 4, 2003.

&quot;Fallen&quot; was initially promoted by the label in the Christian market. Lee and Moody publicly made it clear in an April 2003 interview that they were not a Christian band and did not want to be associated with Christian rock. Moody&#x27;s comments against being in the Christian market immediately prompted Wind-up Records chairman Alan Meltzer to send a letter to Christian radio and retail outlets explaining that despite the &quot;spiritual underpinning that ignited interest and excitement in the Christian religious community&quot;, Evanescence were &quot;a secular band, and as such view their music as entertainment&quot; and the label then &quot;strongly feels that they no longer belong in Christian retail outlets.&quot; Wind-up formally requested the recall of &quot;Fallen&quot; from Christian retailers and radio stations. After receiving the letter, many Christian radio stations pulled &quot;Fallen&quot; songs from their playlists.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated in April 2003 that while Wind-up had no official Christian affiliation, they had been marketing their bands &quot;to both the Christian and mainstream music market.&quot; Wind-Up &quot;began courting the Christian music market more than a year ago, making its first foray with 12 Stones&#x27; self-titled 2002 debut. Hooking up with powerhouse Christian music distributor Provident ... Wind-Up attempted to tap into a segment that generated sales of more than 50 million albums in 2002&quot;. Terry Hemmings, CEO of Provident, said that the decision to recall Evanescence&#x27;s album likely would not hurt Wind-up&#x27;s image in the Christian market, and that he was puzzled by the band&#x27;s about-face, saying: &quot;They clearly understood the album would be sold in these channels.&quot; Meltzer claimed their decision to promote Evanescence in the Christian market was made with the band&#x27;s consent. Lee said that she had always opposed the promotion in the Christian market and the &quot;Christian band&quot; identification from the beginning, while Moody had supported it. Moody had misrepresented Evanescence in the past, talking about his religious beliefs as Evanescence&#x27;s. The label had wanted to use the Christian market promotion as a marketing tool for the band, which she had opposed, stating that &quot;it was an important fight to me because it felt false. That wasn&#x27;t really what our music was. And I felt like they were selling somebody something that wasn&#x27;t true.&quot; She noted that Evanescence &quot;has never been a Christian band&quot; and lyrically never had a religious affiliation.

On January 13, 2003, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single. Wind-up Records president Ed Vetri revealed that when the label introduced the song to radio, radio programmers rejected it, saying, &quot;A chick and a piano? Are you kidding? On rock radio?&quot; Some program directors would hear the female voice and piano at the start of the song and turn it off without listening to the rest of the song. A female voice on rock radio was a rarity, and the song was considered for airplay only after there was a male vocal on it. After the song was released on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack, a grassroots fanbase grew and listeners began requesting air play for it, compelling radio stations to reconsider the band. On the worldwide success of the song, Lee said: 

After the album&#x27;s completion, Evanescence&#x27;s touring lineup was hired, including guitarist John LeCompt, drummer Rocky Gray, and bassist Will Boyd. Evanescence performed on radio shows and on the festival circuit for weeks in early 2003. They embarked on their first headlining tour from April to May in the US. In June, they had to cancel shows in Germany due to Moody reportedly falling ill. That month, they accepted an offer from the video game company Nintendo to perform on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, which they headlined beginning on August 4, 2003. In an August 2003 interview, Moody said that Evanescence is &quot;just Amy and I, and I want to keep it that way&quot;, adding that their process together is what works.

Moody left the band mid-tour in October 2003. Guitarist Terry Balsamo replaced him on tour and as Evanescence&#x27;s lead guitarist. The band played some shows with Korn in Europe, with Evanescence originally set to headline however Lee wanted Korn to headline instead. Evanescence filmed a Paris concert of the &quot;Fallen&quot; tour for their first live album and concert DVD, &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot; (2004).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Fallen&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic wrote that the album “does include flashes of the single&#x27;s PG-rated nu-metal (&#x27;Everybody&#x27;s Fool,&#x27; &#x27;Going Under&#x27;). But it&#x27;s the symphonic goth rock of groups like Type O Negative that influences most of &quot;Fallen&quot;.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, graded the album B-minus: &quot;The genre now too old to be called nü-metal isn&#x27;t exactly overflowing with spine-tinglingly great vocalists – let alone female ones. Amy Lee, lead singer of gloomy Arkansas rockers Evanescence, is an exception.&quot; Kirk Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;when vocalist Amy Lee croons about lying &#x27;in my field of paper flowers&#x27; or &#x27;pouring crimson regret,&#x27; she gives Fallen a creepy spiritual tinge that the new-metal boys lack.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot;″s Christa Titus called the album a &quot;highly polished, hook-filled affair.&quot; Melissa Maerz of &quot;Spin&quot; gave it four out of five stars: &quot;Nu metal gets a powdering of Andrew Lloyd Webber theatrics as Lee aces her piano A-levels, adds a string section, and tackles capital letter issues – God (&#x27;Tourniquet&#x27;), Love (&#x27;Going Under&#x27;), and Death (&#x27;Bring Me To Life&#x27;) – with the grandeur they deserve.&quot; Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; opined that the album &quot;has a small handful of transcendent moments, but a complete lack of musical adventurousness has the band mucking around either in stultifying nu-metal riffage, pretentious high school journal caterwauling, or even worse, both.&quot; Begrand praised Lee&#x27;s &quot;soaring, enchanting, angelic&quot; voice, writing that &quot;Evanescence would be nothing&quot; without her. Christopher Gray of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; found the album to be &quot;a little too by the numbers to fully capitalize on Lee&#x27;s obvious talents.&quot; According to &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, &quot;Their faith, as embodied in Amy Lee&#x27;s clarion sopralto , lends their goth-metal a palpable sweetness&quot;. He jokingly concluded, &quot;Now if only it wasn&#x27;t goth-metal at all.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Fallen&quot; number 99 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, calling it an &quot;unlikely classic&quot; with &quot;a horror-movie-level ambience that was as chilling as it was campy&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Fallen&quot; has sold more than 17 million units worldwide, with 10 million in the US, since its 2003 release. The album debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with more than 141,000 copies sold in its first week, &quot;Fallen&quot; was the eighth-bestselling album of 2004 and the nineteenth-bestselling album of the 2000s. By October 2011 the album had spent 106 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 58 of those weeks in the top 20. Peaking at number three on June 14, 2003, it re-entered the chart at number 192 on March 13, 2010. &quot;Fallen&quot; spent 223 weeks on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart after it fell off the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum in April 2003 and 4× platinum in January 2004; in November 2022, it was certified diamond for 10 million units sold in the US.

On the UK Albums Chart, &quot;Fallen&quot; debuted at number 18 with sales of 15,589 copies. The album reached number one (with 38,570 copies sold) seven weeks later, after &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart. It sold 56,193 copies in December 2003, its highest week of sales (although it was number 28 on the chart that week). &quot;Fallen&quot; spent 33 weeks in the top 20 and 60 weeks in the top 75. It re-entered the UK chart at number 35 the week after the release of Evanescence&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Open Door&quot;. &quot;Fallen&quot; also topped the charts in more than ten other countries and reached the top ten in over 20 countries. According to Nielsen SoundScan figures, after more than three months in the top 10 of the Canadian Albums Chart &quot;Fallen&quot; peaked at number one on August 13, 2003 with sales of 8,900 copies.

<text>Samuel Rhoads (1711 – April 7, 1784) was an American architect who served as the 59th mayor of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Early life and family==
Rhoads was born in Philadelphia into a Quaker family. His grandfather John Rhoads (also spelled Roads or Roades), had faced persecution after joining the Quaker faith. &quot;The Rhoads family was one of note in England, and of great antiquity.&quot; In the late 17th century, he and two of his sons emigrated from Waingroves, Derbyshire to Pennsylvania. The second son, also named John Rhoads, married Hannah Willcox in 1692. Samuel was born in Philadelphia in 1711, their fifth child. He first worked as a carpenter and builder before becoming a merchant.

==Career==
Rhoads&#x27;s political career began in 1741, when he was elected to the Common Council of Philadelphia. He designed the east wing of the Pennsylvania Hospital. He also designed the west wing and an additional outdoor structure that weren&#x27;t built until after his death, in 1794. Rhoads also served on the Board of Managers of the hospital. In 1761 he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly, where he served two terms. Rhoads shared the revolutionary sentiment spreading through the city in the 1770s and was a delegate to the First Continental Congress. He was elected Mayor of Philadelphia in 1774.

An associate and friend of Benjamin Franklin, Rhoads played a role in many of the important institutions of colonial Philadelphia. He was an early Director of the Library Company of Philadelphia, a founding Director of the Philadelphia Contributionship, and a Vice-President of the American Philosophical Society. He was a master of the Carpenters&#x27; Company of Philadelphia.

Rhoads died in 1784, age 73.

==Descendants==
Rhoads was the grandfather of the seventh Clerk of the House of Representatives, Walter S. Franklin, the great-grandfather of (a) Samuel Rhoads Fisher who signed the Declaration of Independence of Texas from Centralist Republic of Mexico and was Secretary of the Navy of the Republic of Texas 
and (b) William B. Franklin, American Civil War general, and the third great grandfather of James McCrea president of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1907 to 1913.

<doc id="561296" wikidata="Q2294767" url="?curid=561296" title="Mr. Satan">
<text>, known as Hercule (French for Heracles) in certain edited versions of the English dub and in Viz&#x27;s English manga, is a character from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media franchise. Created by Akira Toriyama, he first appears in Chapter 393 of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga entitled &quot;The New Kami-sama&quot;, originally published in Issue 44 of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on October 6, 1992. Within the series, he is a flamboyant martial artist who becomes a world-renowned hero after he fallaciously claimed credit for the defeat of the villainous Cell. Years later, he befriends the primordial being Majin Buu and convinces him of the error of his murderous way, leading Buu to expel his evil tendencies which become a different lifeform altogether. After aiding series protagonist Goku in vanquishing the evil incarnation of Buu, the benevolent incarnation moves in with Mr. Satan, and both characters continue to make recurring appearances as supporting characters in the series.

Mr. Satan is a popular character with fans of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series since his introduction, and is generally well received by critics as an effective comic relief character.

==Development==
Series creator Akira Toriyama explained that Mr. Satan is a ring name akin to an in-ring persona or character used by real-life professional wrestlers. In another interview, Toriyama revealed that his real name is , a pun on the Japanese word &quot;akuma&quot; (悪魔), which refers to a malevolent demonic spirit in Japanese folklore. Toriyama also noted that the character is from a cultural region which does not use surnames. In keeping with the naming convention of related &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters after puns with a common theme, his daughter Videl&#x27;s name is an anagram of the word devil. His spouse is never named or discussed within the series, though Toriyama suggested that she was a beautiful singer named &quot;Miguel&quot; (ミゲル, &quot;migeru&quot;), essentially his angelic counterpart based on the notion of an unconventional marriage between both characters.

Due to negative cultural connotations surrounding his namesake, Mr. Satan is renamed in media translated for international audiences in some parts of the world. In North America he is known as Hercule in some English language dubs for the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime, as well as the localized English manga published by Viz Media. In their initial dub of the series, Funimation changed his name to Hercule. However, when they recorded a new dub for uncut home video releases, they switched to using the original Mr. Satan. In the Philippines, the character is known as Master Pogi. The English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai retains his original name.

===Portrayal===
Mr. Satan was voiced by Daisuke Gōri in Japan until his death in 2010. then by Unshō Ishizuka until his death in 2018, with Masashi Ebara being the current voice, except for Dragon Ball Daima, where a mini version of Mr. Satan was voiced by Tōru Sakurai. In English, he is voiced by Don Brown in the Ocean dub, and Chris Rager in the Funimation dub.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;===
Mr. Satan first appears during the Cell Games as a preening challenger of Cell. According to his backstory, once Goku and his companions stop attending the World Martial Arts Tournament, he starts winning the annual World Martial Arts Tournaments and becomes the reigning champion for many years. Mr. Satan attempts to fight Cell but is swatted away in one hit. In spite of this, he is given credit for Cell&#x27;s death by the media and celebrated as a hero.

Years later, he is revealed to be the father of Videl, the would-be love interest of Gohan, and is still revered throughout the world of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; as a hero. He later encounters and befriends Majin Buu: after convincing him of the error of his murderous ways, the benevolent influence within Buu moves the creature to reform, leading him to expel his evil tendencies which become a different lifeform altogether. This aspect of Buu is identical in appearance to his chubby progenitor, although any malevolent behavioral traits previously displayed are gone. He is also much weaker in power, and lacks some of the original Majin Buu&#x27;s unique capabilities.

As one of the few survivors of the evil Buu&#x27;s destructive rampage which culminated in the destruction of Earth, Mr. Satan escapes to the Supreme Kai&#x27;s sacred realm along with Goku and his remaining associates. When Goku is on the verge of losing the final fight against Buu&#x27;s evil incarnation, Mr. Satan rallies the people of Earth to turn the tide in Goku&#x27;s favor by directing them to contribute their energy to Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-Dama&quot;, an energy sphere attack created by gathering energy from surrounding animals, nature and humans. Following the demise of the evil Buu by Goku, his benevolent counterpart moves in with Mr. Satan and his pet labrador retriever , and goes by , while Mr. Satan again takes the credit for defeating evil Buu, though Goku and his friends willingly go along with it to keep their lives private and out of respect for Mr. Satan&#x27;s vital role in Buu&#x27;s defeat.

===Later series===
Mr. Satan makes minor appearances in the &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; anime series, where he is protected from the extraterrestrial villain Baby&#x27;s influence by Majin Buu and later his successor, Uub.

Mr. Satan again appears as a supporting character in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, where he is often seen in the company of Mr. Buu. Mr. Satan essentially serves as the caretaker of his friend as Buu has a childlike personality. He is depicted as having grown immensely wealthy due to the monetary rewards he received from his false claims of successfully defending Earth from multiple external threats. In one episode of the anime version, Mr. Satan enacts an imaginary fight with Beerus, the God of Destruction, in a televised retelling of the series&#x27; in-universe events where he embellishes himself with the ability to power up as a Super Saiyan.

===Films===
Mr. Satan appears as a supporting character in multiple spinoff films of the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; series, namely &quot;Bojack Unbound&quot;, &quot;Bio-Broly&quot; and &quot;Fusion Reborn&quot;, as well as the 2008 television special &quot;Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!&quot;.

===In other media===
Mr. Satan appears in the &quot;Dragon Ball x One Piece: Cross Epoch&quot; manga, a crossover between the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot; series, and in the 2013 crossover show &quot;Dream 9 Toriko &amp; One Piece &amp; Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!&quot;.

Mr. Satan has appeared in several &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; video games, often as a comically ineffective &quot;joke&quot; playable character. The character &quot;Morrie&quot;, from the game Dragon Quest VIII closely resembles an emaciated version of Mr. Satan&#x27;s older form.

==Reception==

In 1993, Mr. Satan placed seventh in a &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character popularity poll voted on by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; readers, and was also voted the eleventh most popular character by fans of the series for the 2004 book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. The character has been the subject of fan art and custom merchandise.

In his review of Season 6 of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series, Anime News Network&#x27;s Theron Martin said Mr. Satan &quot;may be the most obnoxious major character within the entire series&quot;, and that he found the character&#x27;s &quot;cowardice and efforts to play off the power of Cell and the Z fighters as some kind of trick&quot; to be a nuisance even within the context of his comic relief nature. Martin noted that Mr. Satan does have some semblance of self-awareness in that he knows he is severely outclassed by the other main characters, and that he serves as a yardstick between them and the rest of humanity. Martin judged Mr. Satan&#x27;s antics in Season 8 to be less irritating and more amusing or entertaining than his earlier appearances in the series, particularly with his efforts to claim glory for himself or to &quot;weasel out a victory&quot;.

Brandon Zachary from &quot;CBR&quot; described Mr. Satan as the &quot;J. Jonah Jameson of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;&quot; due to his morally complex nature. Patricia Hernandez from &quot;Kotaku&quot; consider the scenes which feature Mr. Satan and Mr. Buu to be among her favorite moments of the first episode of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, and looked forward to seeing more of their interactions together. Both Hernandez and Zachary observed that while Mr. Satan achieved his prestigious social status through deception, he does show a conscience as well as a charitable side to his character. Evan Valentine from &quot;Comicbook.com&quot; noted that while Mr. Satan is not very heroic himself, he nevertheless plays an important role in tempering Majin Buu&#x27;s personality and helps the former villain to reform into a genuine hero. Valentine also highlighted his character development throughout the series&#x27; history, noting that underneath the attention-seeking and boastful exterior is a personality who truly cares for his family and friends, such as willingly (albeit secretively) giving up the reward money received in a ceremony honoring his believed heroic acts to Goku, who both deserved and needed it more than he did. Game designer Hiroshi Matsuyama from CyberConnect2 was pleased that Mr. Satan, a representative of the feeble human race, is the only character who could emotionally connect with Buu, and later became the savior of the world when he leveraged his celebrity influence for the &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; attack prepared by Goku, an appealing but ultimately unrelatable protagonist for Matsuyama.

<text>Brühl () is a municipality in the Rhein-Neckar district of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The former fishing village along the Rhine has become a satellite of a growing Mannheim. Many of the residents of Brühl work in Mannheim. Brühl is known as the hometown of former tennis player Steffi Graf.

==Geography==
Mannheim lies directly on Brühl&#x27;s northern border. The Rhine is to the west near the confluence of the Leimbach. The peninsular Koller Island (&quot;Kollerinsel&quot;) is one of the few pieces of land on the left bank of the Rhine that belong to Baden-Württemberg. This 4 km2 area is part of Brühl. It borders the communities of Altrip, Waldsee, and Otterstadt. To the south is Ketsch and to the east is Schwetzingen.

The municipality consists of two boroughs:
*Brühl
*Rohrhof

==History==
Rohrhof was first mentioned in documents in 976. This was the occasion of a gift from emperor Otto II to Hanno, the bishop of Worms. Brühl (&quot;Bruowele&quot;) was first mentioned in a document listing the income of the bishop of Speyer in 1157. From 1405 until 1600, the lords of Handschuhsheim governed the land as a temporal fief from Speyer and the Electorate of the Palatinate of the Rhine. This division of temporal and spiritual dominion (condominium) ended with a treaty in which Speyer withdrew its worldly rights in 1709. In 1803 the towns became part of Baden. In 1878 the two independent communities of Brühl and Rohrhof were unified. In 1944 a part of Rohrhof was given to Mannheim.

&quot;Live and celebrate on the Rhine&quot; is the motto of the communities jubilee, &quot;850 Years Brühl&quot; on 13 March 2007.

<doc id="561298" wikidata="Q504071" url="?curid=561298" title="Andrew Charles Elliott">
<text>Andrew Charles Elliott (June 22, 1829 – April 9, 1889) was a British Columbian politician and jurist who was the fourth premier of British Columbia from 1876 to 1878.

==Career==
Elliott&#x27;s varied career in British Columbia included gold commissioner, stipendiary magistrate, and, following the union of the Island and Mainland Colonies in 1866, high sheriff of the province. He resigned his magistracy to take the post as High Sheriff. He was a member of the colony&#x27;s appointed Colonial Assembly from 1865 to 1866. After the colony became a province of Canada, he was elected, in 1875, to the Victoria City seat in the provincial legislature and became leader of the opposition. Before his election to the House, he was a provincial magistrate in Lillooet.

In 1876, Elliott became the fourth Premier of the province on the defeat of George Anthony Walkem&#x27;s government in a Motion of No Confidence. His government was unstable, and he was unable to make progress with the federal government on the province&#x27;s demands that Ottawa builds a railway to the Pacific. Tax increases and the government&#x27;s failure to secure a railway terminus for Victoria, British Columbia led to Elliott&#x27;s defeat in his riding in the 1878 election as well as the defeat of his government.

==Death==
Andrew Charles Elliott is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia. His obituary in Amor de Cosmos&#x27; Victoria &quot;Colonist&quot; newspaper read:

==Family life==
His daughter Mary married James W. Douglas, the only son of James Douglas, but his son-in-law died at age 32, and Elliott was one of the pallbearers at the funeral.

<doc id="561306" wikidata="Q5237149" url="?curid=561306" title="David Marsden">
<text>David Charles Marsden (born in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian radio broadcaster. Initially operating under the on-air name of Dave Mickie, with much fast-talking patter, he was a notable Toronto DJ of the 1960s who attracted critical attention from Marshall McLuhan. Reinventing himself, and using his real name of David Marsden, he became a much more laid-back free-form DJ, notably at CHOM in Montreal then CHUM-FM in Toronto in the 1970s. He then became the driving force behind Brampton, Ontario radio station CFNY in the 1980s, becoming an influential figure in the Canadian music industry by giving many Canadian and international alternative rock artists major Canadian radio exposure. During his stint at CFNY, his nickname (often referred to on-air) was &quot;The Mars Bar&quot;.

Marsden currently runs the on-air streaming service nythespirit.com.

==Early career==

Raised in a foster family in Stratford, Ontario, Marsden took on the name &quot;Dave Mickie&quot; using the last name of his foster parents. Under the name Dave Mickie, he was the original manager of The Revols, a Stratford, Ontario rock band in the late 1950s whose famous members included, Richard Manuel, who would later become part of The Band; Ken Kalmusky, who played with Ian and Sylvia and Great Speckled Bird; and, John Till who formed, and played guitar in, Janis Joplin&#x27;s Full Tilt Boogie Band. He later became one of Canada&#x27;s pioneering rock DJs on radio, joining Chatham&#x27;s CFCO in 1963. Bored with the station&#x27;s commercial easy listening music, he reportedly brought in some of his own records one night, breaking format and hosting in an uncharacteristically dynamic style. He was fired the next morning, but was quickly rehired after the station learned his experiment had increased the station&#x27;s ratings.

He was later hired at CKEY in Toronto where he was called &quot;the most controversial thing on Toronto radio.&quot; He parted ways with CKEY after just five months. He became host of &quot;Music Hop&quot; on CBC Television in 1965, succeeding Alex Trebek. He also started writing a column for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in the same year. He was the subject of a chapter in Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s book &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, which lauded his unique hosting style:

The Dave Mickie name and persona were phased out in the mid-to-late 1960s, and as David Marsden, he joined Montreal&#x27;s CKGM in 1967. Under his own birth name, his hosting style was much less manic and more relaxed, although still informal and often somewhat unpredictable.

In 1969, he moved to CKGM&#x27;s sister station, CKGM-FM, where Marsden was instrumental in switching the station&#x27;s format from beautiful music to free form progressive rock. In 1973, Marsden returned to Toronto with his new, completely different on-air persona at CHUM-FM. He left the station in February 1975 to devote more time to his radio commercial production company, but mainly because of the tight playlist CHUM-FM was making their DJs follow. Marsden refused to follow a playlist and left shortly after it was instituted. He eventually returned as an on-air personality at CHIC-FM shortly before it was transformed into CFNY.

==Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon==
In 1973 Marsden played a major role in introducing the (at that time) largely unknown Pink Floyd to Toronto. He started a petition to persuade Toronto&#x27;s Concert Productions International and promoter Michael Cohl to bring the band, who were touring to promote the as yet unreleased Dark Side of the Moon, to Maple Leaf Gardens for the first time. The resulting show sold out in 45 minutes. He also played an advance copy of Dark Side of the Moon twice, from start to finish, on his show. He found out later that Capitol Records had other plans for the album&#x27;s premiere. “We preceded the world premiere by four days and, of course, CHUM-FM was only available in the Toronto area,” Marsden said. “But it was a world premiere as far as I was concerned.” 

==Creates &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;==
After CFNY program director Dave Pritchard left the station in 1978 due to conflicts with the station management, Marsden was promoted to program director. The station&#x27;s mandate had been to present significantly different programming than other radio stations in the Greater Toronto Area. Before Marsden&#x27;s arrival the station&#x27;s format had been highly eclectic. Marsden saw the commercial potential of punk and new wave, and widened CFNY&#x27;s focus even further, creating Canada&#x27;s first alternative music station. Throughout the 1980s, under the slogan &quot;the spirit of radio&quot;, CFNY was one of the most influential promoters of new international and Canadian artists most radio stations ignored.

In 1985, Marsden also judged some episodes of CBC Television&#x27;s battle of the bands competition series &quot;Rock Wars&quot;.

In July 1987, Marsden and CFNY general manager Bill Hutton hired Don Berns as the new program director. Initially, Marsden continued as director of operations, and as executive producer of the CASBY Awards, but left CFNY a year later. He joined the CBC and moved to Vancouver to produce the TV show &quot;Pilot One&quot;. That show won several awards, including a silver medal at the Chicago Film and Video Festival. Following that, Marsden launched another freeform modern rock station, Coast 800, later &quot;Coast 1040&quot;, in Vancouver.

He was later involved in the creation of Iceberg Radio, the first major Canadian Internet radio project, and returned to the terrestrial radio airwaves as host of a freeform rock show on Oshawa, Ontario&#x27;s The Rock 94.9 in the early 2000s.

==&quot;The Marsden Theatre&quot;==
The &quot;David Marsden Radio Program&quot;, also known as &quot;The Marsden Theatre&quot;, aired twice a week on Oshawa, Ontario radio station CKGE-FM (a.k.a. The Rock) from June 2003 to December 2014. Originally, Marsden&#x27;s show was on Thursday and Friday nights, but it was moved to Saturday and Sunday nights in March 2010. After Jim Ladd was no longer broadcasting on KLOS as of 2011, during his last few years on CKGE, Marsden was the only free form DJ on a commercial radio station in North America.

Though it was announced the show would end on December 14, 2014, Marsden&#x27;s final broadcast aired on December 7. There was on-air promotion of a final set of shows the following week (December 13–14), but this never transpired, as Marsden announced on his Facebook page, &quot;I believed it to be best under the circumstances as they played out during the week that I withdraw and disappear quietly from The Rock.&quot;

==&quot;NYTheSpirit.com&quot;==
Most recently, Marsden and his business partner Igor Loukine created the subscription based radio channel NYTheSpirit.com, which launched in September, 2014. The station plays a mixture of music, concentrating heavily on the 1980s alternative scene, but with a freeform mentality that mimics Marsden&#x27;s 1980s heyday at CFNY.

After leaving The Rock, Marsden began doing occasional live hosting gigs on NYTheSpirit; the first one aired on Christmas Eve 2014. Beginning in February 2015, The Marsden Theatre became a regular feature on NYTheSpirit; the live show is currently broadcast Friday and Saturday nights (8PM to midnight, EST). As well, there is an annual 4-hour Christmas Eve special.

==Legacy==
Marsden has been profiled in exhibits at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, both for his on-air Dave Mickie persona and for his role as program director of CFNY. He is openly gay, and has also worked as a club DJ at gay club nights dubbed &quot;The Mars Bar&quot;. He was featured in a 2015 documentary about radio DJs called &quot;I Am What I Play&quot;, directed by Roger King. An animated likeness of him at the control board on CFNY appears in a video of The Spirit of Radio by the band, RUSH.

<text>611 is an abbreviated dialing telephone number in the North American Numbering Plan, implemented by many telephone companies for reporting troubles with telephone service, or with a payphone. It is an N11 code, which are reserved from assignment as area codes or central office codes, for use in special services.

==Background==

While 6-1-1 was in use to call repair service in some areas from as early as the 1930s, other codes were also used, the most common being 114 (with 113 used for information). A decision to standardize on 6-1-1 (and 4-1-1 for information) nationwide was made in the 1960s, but the use of 114 was still widespread in the 1970s, and into the 1980s in some areas. 
In some localities, 6-1-1 was used to report problems with landline telephone service. 8-1-1 was used to report problems with cellular telephone service but this has since been discontinued.

Many landline and mobile phone providers support 611. Some providers who supply other services, such as Internet or cable television, support these other services with 611. While 611 has not been officially designated by the FCC, the code receives nearly 74 million calls annually, making it the most frequently used N11 number in the United States.

611 is not formally assigned by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), but both have chosen not to disturb the assignment as it is generally recognized across the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA).

<text>The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Based on the 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; by L. Frank Baum, it was primarily directed by Victor Fleming, who left production to take over the troubled &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. It stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, while others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with lyrics by Edgar &quot;Yip&quot; Harburg.

&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is celebrated for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters. It was a critical success and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Song for &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and Best Original Score for Stothart; an Academy Juvenile Award was presented to Judy Garland. It was on a preliminary list of submissions from the studios for an Academy Award for Cinematography (Color) but was not nominated. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit until its 1949 re-release, earning only $3 million on a $2.7 million budget, making it MGM&#x27;s most expensive production at the time.

The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on CBS reintroduced the film to the public. According to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;; it is also one of the few films on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register. The film was ranked second in &quot;Variety&quot;″s inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022. It was among the top ten in the 2005 British Film Institute (BFI) list of 50 Films to be Seen by the Age of 14 and is on the BFI&#x27;s updated list of 50 Films to be Seen by the Age of 15 released in May 2020. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. The film frequently ranks on critics&#x27; lists of the greatest films of all time and is the most commercially successful adaptation of Baum&#x27;s work.

==Plot==
In rural Kansas, Dorothy Gale lives on a farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, and wishes she could be somewhere else. Dorothy&#x27;s neighbor, Almira Gulch, who had been bitten by Dorothy&#x27;s dog, Toto, obtains a sheriff&#x27;s order authorizing her to seize Toto. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller, convinces Dorothy that Em is heartbroken, which prompts Dorothy to return home. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious. She seemingly awakens to find the house moving through the air, with her and Toto still inside it.

The house comes down in an unknown land, and Dorothy is greeted by a good witch named Glinda, who floats down in a bubble and explains that Dorothy has landed in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, suddenly appears. Before she can seize her deceased sister&#x27;s ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy&#x27;s feet and tells her to keep them on. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the home of the Wizard of Oz, as he might know how to help her return home. Glinda then floats away in the bubble.

Along the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage. The group reaches the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. The group is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, but the guard relents due to Dorothy&#x27;s grief, and the four are led into the Wizard&#x27;s chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch&#x27;s broomstick.

During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her, and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow&#x27;s arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away.

The Witch&#x27;s guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick, and the four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the &quot;Wizard&quot; is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects a ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront the Wizard, who insists he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then &quot;grants&quot; the wishes of Dorothy&#x27;s three friends by giving them tokens to confirm that they have the qualities they sought.

The Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his balloon, she accepts, but Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy heeds Glinda&#x27;s instructions by tapping her heels three times and repeating, &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home.&quot;

Dorothy awakens in her own bed in Kansas. She recounts her adventures, but Em says that she just had a bad dream. Dorothy tells Marvel and the farm hands that they were in Oz also, and they smile, humoring her. As Dorothy hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, &quot;Oh, Auntie Em, there&#x27;s no place like home!&quot;

==Cast==
In the film&#x27;s end credits, whenever a Kansas character has a counterpart in Oz, only the Kansas character is listed. For example, Frank Morgan is listed as playing Professor Marvel, but not the Wizard of Oz. The only Oz characters listed in the credits are Glinda and Nikko and the Munchkins.

==Production==
===Development===
Production on the film began when Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children&#x27;s stories and fairytales could be successful. In January 1938, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to L. Frank Baum&#x27;s popular novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; from Samuel Goldwyn. Goldwyn had considered making the film as a vehicle for Eddie Cantor, who was under contract to Samuel Goldwyn Productions and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.

The script went through several writers and revisions. Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s assistant, William H. Cannon, had submitted a brief four-page outline. Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was scaring crows from cornfields, and the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless that he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. This torture softened him into somebody gentler and kinder. Cannon&#x27;s vision was similar to Larry Semon&#x27;s 1925 film adaptation, in which the magical elements are absent.

Afterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes. A few weeks later, Mankiewicz delivered a further 56 pages. LeRoy also hired Noel Langley and poet Ogden Nash to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline; Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. Langley then turned in three more scripts, this time incorporating the songs written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They were asked to ensure that the story stayed true to Baum&#x27;s book. However, producer Arthur Freed was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley. During filming, Victor Fleming and John Lee Mahin revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes. Haley and Lahr are also known to have written some of their dialogue for the Kansas sequence.

They completed the final draft of the script on October 8, 1938, following numerous rewrites. Others who contributed to the adaptation without credit include Irving Brecher, Herbert Fields, Arthur Freed, Yip Harburg, Samuel Hoffenstein, Jack Mintz, Sid Silvers, Richard Thorpe, George Cukor and King Vidor. Only Langley, Ryerson, and Woolf were credited for the script.

In addition, songwriter Harburg&#x27;s son (and biographer) Ernie Harburg reported:

So anyhow, Yip also wrote all the dialogue in that time and the setup to the songs and he also wrote the part where they give out the heart, the brains, and the nerve, because he was the final script editor. And he – there was eleven screenwriters on that – and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art. But he doesn&#x27;t get credit for that. He gets lyrics by E. Y. Harburg, you see. But nevertheless, he put his influence on the thing.
Langley seems to have thought that a 1939 audience was too sophisticated to accept Oz as a straight-ahead fantasy; therefore, it was reconceived as a lengthy, elaborate dream sequence. Because they perceived a need to attract a youthful audience by appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called &quot;The Jitterbug&quot;, and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical music and operetta. The princess challenged Dorothy to a singing contest, in which Dorothy&#x27;s swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for Betty Jaynes, but was later dropped.

Another scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene in Kansas after Dorothy&#x27;s return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college, and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy&#x27;s partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, and is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll miss you most of all.&quot;

Much attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. It took the studio&#x27;s art department almost a week to settle on the shade of yellow used for the Yellow Brick Road.

===Casting===
Several actresses were reportedly considered for the part of Dorothy, including Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox, at the time, the most prominent child star; Deanna Durbin, a relative newcomer, with a recognized operatic voice; and Judy Garland, the most experienced of the three. Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.
Ray Bolger was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebsen was to play the Scarecrow. Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol Fred Stone had done on stage in 1902; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, &quot;I&#x27;m not a tin performer; I&#x27;m fluid&quot;), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired. Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow&#x27;s distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous &quot;wobbly-walk&quot; of Stone&#x27;s Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.

W. C. Fields was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard (after Ed Wynn turned it down, considering the part &quot;too small&quot;), but the studio could not meet Fields&#x27; fee. Wallace Beery lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, Frank Morgan, was cast on September 22.

Veteran vaudeville performer Pat Walshe was best known for his performance as various monkeys in many theater productions and circus shows. He was cast as Nikko, the head Winged Monkey, on September 28, traveling to MGM studios on October 3.

An extensive talent search produced over a hundred dwarves to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film&#x27;s Oz sequences would have to be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor Jerry Maren, the dwarves were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to $ today). Meinhardt Raabe, who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary &quot;The Making of the Wizard of Oz&quot; that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer Adrian, had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They photographed and cataloged each Munchkin in their costume so they could consistently apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.

Gale Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, but withdrew from the role when the witch&#x27;s persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the Evil Queen in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) to the familiar &quot;ugly hag&quot;. She was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player Margaret Hamilton. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD that she had no regrets about turning down the part. Sondergaard would go on to play a glamorous feline villainess in Fox&#x27;s version of Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; in 1940. Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1939).

According to Aljean Harmetz, the &quot;gone-to-seed&quot; coat worn by Morgan as the Wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, Baum&#x27;s widow confirmed this, and the coat was eventually presented to her. However, Baum biographer Michael Patrick Hearn says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a rumor concocted by the studio.

===Filming===
====Ebsen replaced by Haley====
The production faced the challenge of creating the Tin Man&#x27;s costume. Several tests were done to find the right makeup and clothes for Ebsen. Ten days into the shoot, Ebsen suffered a toxic reaction after repeatedly inhaling the aluminum dust (which his daughter, Kiki Ebsen, has said the studio misrepresented as an &quot;allergic reaction&quot;) in the aluminum powder makeup he wore, though he did recall taking a breath one night without suffering any immediate effects. He was hospitalized in critical condition and was subsequently forced to leave the project. In a later interview (included on the 2005 DVD release of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;), he recalled that the studio heads appreciated the seriousness of his illness only after he was hospitalized. Filming halted while a replacement for him was sought.

No footage of Ebsen as the Tin Man has ever been releasedonly photos taken during filming and makeup tests. His replacement, Jack Haley, assumed Ebsen had been fired. The makeup used for Haley was quietly changed to an aluminum paste, with a layer of clown white greasepaint underneath, in order to protect his skin. Although it did not have the same dire effect on Haley, he did at one point suffer an eye infection from it. To keep down on production costs, Haley only rerecorded &quot;If I Only Had a Heart&quot; and solo lines during &quot;If I Only Had the Nerve&quot; and the scrapped song &quot;The Jitterbug&quot;; as such, Ebsen&#x27;s voice can still be heard in the remaining songs featuring the Tin Man in group vocals.

====George Cukor&#x27;s brief stint====
LeRoy, after reviewing the footage and feeling Thorpe was rushing the production, adversely affecting the actors&#x27; performances, had Thorpe replaced. During reorganization on the production, George Cukor temporarily took over under LeRoy&#x27;s guidance. Initially, the studio had made Garland wear a blonde wig and heavy &quot;baby-doll&quot; makeup, and she played Dorothy in an exaggerated fashion. Cukor changed Garland&#x27;s and Hamilton&#x27;s makeup and costumes, and told Garland to &quot;be herself&quot;. This meant that all the scenes Garland and Hamilton had already completed had to be reshot. Cukor also suggested the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from Fox, as the Tin Man.

====Victor Fleming, the main director====

Cukor did not shoot any scenes for the film, but acted merely as a creative advisor to the troubled production. His prior commitment to direct &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; required him to leave on November 3, 1938, when Victor Fleming assumed directorial responsibility. As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor&#x27;s creative realignment. Producer LeRoy had already expressed his satisfaction with the film&#x27;s new course.

Production on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4 a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100 °F (38 °C), which also had the side effect of bringing the production&#x27;s electricity bill to a staggering estimate of $225,000 (). Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary; and the toxicity of Hamilton&#x27;s copper-based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days. It took as many as twelve takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the Yellow Brick Road.

All the Oz sequences were filmed in three-strip Technicolor, while the opening and closing credits, and the Kansas sequences, were filmed in black and white and colored in a sepia-tone process. Sepia-tone film was also used in the scene where Aunt Em appears in the Wicked Witch&#x27;s crystal ball. The film was not the first to use Technicolor, which was introduced in &quot;The Gulf Between&quot; (1917) as a two-color additive process, nor the first to use the three-color subtractive Technicolor Process 4, which made its live-action debut during a sequence in &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (1934).

In Hamilton&#x27;s exit from Munchkinland, a concealed elevator was installed to lower her below stage level, as fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit. The first take ran well, but on the second take, the burst of fire came too soon. The flames set fire to her green, copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns to her hands and face. She spent three months recuperating before returning to work. Her green makeup had usually been removed with acetone due to its toxic copper content. Because of Hamilton&#x27;s burns, makeup artist Jack Young removed the makeup with alcohol to prevent infection.

====On-set treatment and abuse allegations====
In the decades since the film’s release, credible stories have come out indicating that Judy Garland endured extensive abuse during and before filming from various parties involved. The studio went to extreme lengths to change her appearance, including binding her chest and giving her Benzedrine tablets to keep her weight down, along with uppers and downers that caused giggling fits. There were claims that various members of the cast pointed out her breasts and made other lewd comments. Victor Fleming slapped her during the Cowardly Lion&#x27;s introduction scene when Garland could not stop laughing at Lahr&#x27;s performance. Once the scene was done, Fleming, reportedly ashamed of himself, ordered the crew to punch him in the face. Garland, however, kissed him instead. She was also forced to wear a cap on her teeth due to the fact some of her teeth were misaligned and also had to wear rubber discs on her nose to change its shape during filming. Claims have been made in memoirs that the frequently drunk actors portraying the Munchkins propositioned and pinched her. Garland said that she was groped by Louis B. Mayer.

==Special effects, makeup and costumes==
Arnold Gillespie, the film&#x27;s special effects director, employed several techniques. Developing the tornado scene was especially costly. Gillespie used muslin cloth to make the tornado flexible, after a previous attempt with rubber failed. He hung the of muslin from a steel gantry and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. Fuller&#x27;s earth was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect. Dorothy&#x27;s house was recreated using a model. Stock footage of this tornado was later recycled for a climactic scene in the 1943 musical film &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, directed by Judy Garland&#x27;s eventual second husband Vincente Minnelli.

The Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow masks were made of foam latex makeup created by makeup artist Jack Dawn. Dawn was one of the first to use this technique. It took an hour each day to slowly peel Bolger&#x27;s glued-on mask from his face, a process that eventually left permanent lines around his mouth and chin.

The Tin Man&#x27;s costume was made of leather-covered buckram, and the oil used to grease his joints was made from chocolate syrup. The Cowardly Lion&#x27;s costume was made from real lion skin and fur. Due to the heavy makeup, Bert Lahr could only consume soup and milkshakes on break, which eventually made him sick. After a few months, Lahr put his foot down and requested normal meals along with makeup redos after lunch. For the &quot;horse of a different color&quot; scene, Jell-O powder was used to color the white horses. Asbestos was used to achieve some of the special effects, such as the witch&#x27;s burning broomstick and the fake snow that covers Dorothy as she sleeps in the field of poppies.

==Music==

&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is famous for its musical selections and soundtrack. Its songs were composed by Harold Arlen, with lyrics by E. Y. &quot;Yip&quot; Harburg. They won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. The song ranks first in the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs and the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s &quot;365 Songs of the Century&quot;.

MGM composer Herbert Stothart, a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

Georgie Stoll was associate conductor, and screen credit was given to George Bassman, Murray Cutter, Ken Darby and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements. (As usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)

The songs were recorded in the studio&#x27;s scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Although he had to be dropped from the cast because of a dangerous reaction to his aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained on the soundtrack (as mentioned in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). He can be heard in the group vocals of &quot;We&#x27;re Off to See the Wizard&quot;.

Bolger&#x27;s original recording of &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot; was far more sedate than the version in the film. During filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided a more energetic rendition better suited Dorothy&#x27;s initial meeting with the Scarecrow, and it was rerecorded. The original version was considered lost until a copy was discovered in 2009.

===Songs===
===Deleted songs===

Some musical pieces were filmed and deleted later, in the editing process.

The song &quot;The Jitterbug&quot;, written in a swing style, was intended for a sequence where the group journeys to the Witch&#x27;s castle. Owing to time constraints, it was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage of the song has been lost, although silent 8mm color home-film footage of the rehearsals has survived. The audio recording of the song was preserved, and was included in the 1995 Rhino Records two-CD deluxe edition of the soundtrack, as well as on the film&#x27;s VHS and DVD editions. A reference to &quot;The Jitterbug&quot; remains in the film: The Witch tells her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because &quot;I&#x27;ve sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.&quot;

Another musical number cut before release came right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot; (blended with &quot;We&#x27;re Off to See the Wizard&quot; and &quot;The Merry Old Land of Oz&quot;) with the lyrics altered to &quot;Hail! Hail! The witch is dead!&quot; This started with the Witch&#x27;s guard saying &quot;Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!&quot; and dissolved to a huge celebration by the citizens of the Emerald City, who sang the song as they accompanied Dorothy and her friends to the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost, and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio track was preserved and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record &quot;deluxe&quot; soundtrack edition.

Garland was to sing a brief reprise of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; while Dorothy was trapped in the Witch&#x27;s castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. Because Garland sang the reprise live on set, only the underscoring from the final edit survives. However, the on-set audio of the scene when it was originally filmed under Richard Thorpe still exists and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onward. The Deluxe Edition soundtrack marries the singing from the Thorpe take to the underscoring from the Fleming version to approximate what this would have sounded like.

===Underscoring===
Extensive edits in the film&#x27;s final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully underscored, with instrumental snippets from the film&#x27;s various leitmotifs throughout. There was also some recognizable classical and popular music, including:
* Excerpts from Schumann&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Farmer&quot;, at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto hurry home after their encounter with Miss Gulch; when Toto escapes from her; and when the house &quot;rides&quot; the tornado.
* An excerpt of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Scherzo in E minor, Op. 16, No. 2, when Toto escapes from the Witch&#x27;s castle.
* An excerpt of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion try to escape from the Witch&#x27;s castle.
* &quot;In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree&quot;, when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.
* &quot;Gaudeamus Igitur&quot;, as the Wizard presents awards to the group.
* &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;, in part of the closing scene, at Dorothy&#x27;s house in Kansas.

==Post-production==
Principal photography concluded with the monochromatic Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939. When Victor Fleming was called away to replace George Cukor as director of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, veteran director King Vidor agreed to direct &quot;Oz&quot; during its final ten days of principal production. This included the bulk of the Kansas scenes, including Garland&#x27;s performance of &quot;Over the Rainbow.&quot;

Reshoots and pickup shots were done through April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. When the &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; reprise was removed after subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back to reshoot the &quot;Auntie Em, I&#x27;m frightened!&quot; scene without the song. The footage of Blandick&#x27;s Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was reused.

After Hamilton&#x27;s severe injuries with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pickups for the scene where she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy had stunt double Betty Danko perform instead. Danko was severely injured when the smoke mechanism malfunctioned.

At this point, the film began a long, arduous post-production. Herbert Stothart composed the film&#x27;s background score, while A. Arnold Gillespie perfected the special effects, including many of the rear-projection shots. The MGM art department created matte paintings for many scene backgrounds.

A significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone. However, it was abandoned because it was too expensive and labor-intensive, and MGM used a simpler, less expensive technique: During the May reshoots, the inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame. Once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house&#x27;s shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland. If one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy and she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.

Test screenings of the film began on June 5, 1939. &quot;Oz&quot; initially ran nearly two hours long. In 1939, the average film ran for about 90 minutes. LeRoy and Fleming knew they needed to cut at least 15 minutes to get the film down to a manageable running time. Three sneak previews in San Bernardino, Pomona and San Luis Obispo, California, guided LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were &quot;The Jitterbug&quot; number, the Scarecrow&#x27;s elaborate dance sequence following &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot;, reprises of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot;, and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.

&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was almost deleted. MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her signature song.

After the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.

==Release==
===Original theatrical run===

The film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on August 10, 1939, although this is disputed by the August 23, 1939 issue of “The Exhibitor,” which places the debut a day earlier in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The first sneak preview was held in San Bernardino, California. The film was previewed in three test markets: Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 11, 1939; Dennis, Massachusetts, also on August 11; and the Strand Theatre in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, on August 12.

The Hollywood premiere was on August 16, 1939, following a preview the night before at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. The New York City premiere, held at Loew&#x27;s Capitol Theatre on August 17, 1939, was followed by a live performance with Garland and her frequent film co-star Mickey Rooney. They continued to perform there after each screening for a week. Garland extended her appearance for two more weeks, partnered with Rooney for a second week and with &quot;Oz&quot; co-stars Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr for the third and final week. The film opened nationwide on August 25, 1939.

===Television===
MGM sold CBS the rights to televise the film for $225,000 (equivalent to $ in ) per broadcast. It was first shown on television on November 3, 1956, as the last installment of the &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot;. It was a ratings success, with a Nielsen rating of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.

It was repeated on December 13, 1959, and gained an even larger television audience, with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%. It became an annual television tradition.

The UK television premiere was on Christmas Day, 1975, on BBC1. The estimated UK television audience was 20 million.

===Home media===
On October 25, 1980, the film was released on videocassette (in both VHS and Betamax format) by MGM/CBS Home Video. All current home video releases are by Warner Home Video (via current rights holder Turner Entertainment).

The film&#x27;s first LaserDisc release was in 1983. In 1989, there were two releases for the 50th anniversary, one from Turner and one from The Criterion Collection, with a commentary track. LaserDiscs came out in 1991 and 1993, and the final LaserDisc was released September 11, 1996.

The film was released on the CED format once, in 1982, by MGM/UA Home Video. It has also been released multiple times outside of the North American and European markets, in Asia, in the Video CD format.

The first DVD release was on March 26, 1997, by MGM/Turner. It contained no special features or supplements. On October 19, 1999, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was re-released by Warner Bros. to celebrate the film&#x27;s 60th anniversary, with its soundtrack presented in a new 5.1 surround sound mix. The DVD also contained a behind-the-scenes documentary, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic&quot;, produced in 1990 and hosted by Angela Lansbury, which was originally shown on television immediately following the 1990 telecast of the film. It had been featured in the 1993 &quot;Ultimate Oz&quot; LaserDisc release. Outtakes, the deleted &quot;Jitterbug&quot; musical number, clips of pre-1939 &quot;Oz&quot; adaptations, trailers, newsreels, and a portrait gallery were also included, as well as two radio programs of the era publicizing the film.

In 2005, two DVD editions were released, both featuring a newly restored version of the film with an audio commentary and an isolated music and effects track. One of the two DVD releases was a &quot;Two-Disc Special Edition&quot;, featuring production documentaries, trailers, outtakes, newsreels, radio shows and still galleries. The other set, a &quot;Three-Disc Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, included these features, as well as the digitally restored 80th-anniversary edition of the 1925 feature-length silent film version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, other silent &quot;Oz&quot; adaptations and a 1933 animated short version.

The film was released on Blu-ray on September 29, 2009, for its 70th anniversary, in a four-disc &quot;Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, including all the bonus features from the 2005 Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD, new bonus features about Victor Fleming and the surviving Munchkins, the telefilm &quot;The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;MGM: When the Lion Roars&quot;. For this edition, Warner Bros. commissioned a new transfer from the original negatives at 8K resolution. The restoration job was given to Prime Focus World. This restored version also features a lossless 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track.

On December 1, 2009, three Blu-ray discs of the Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition were repackaged as a less expensive &quot;Emerald Edition&quot;. An Emerald Edition four-disc DVD arrived the following week. A single-disc Blu-ray, containing the restored movie and all the extra features of the two-disc Special Edition DVD, became available on March 16, 2010.

In 2013, the film was re-released on DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and UltraViolet for the 90th anniversary of Warner Bros. and the 75th anniversary of the film.

Many special editions were released in 2013 in celebration of the film&#x27;s 75th anniversary, including one exclusively by Best Buy (a SteelBook of the 3D Blu-ray) and another by Target stores that came with a keepsake lunch bag.

The film was issued on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 29, 2019, featuring both a Dolby Vision and an HDR10+ grading from an 8K transfer. Another 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release, including collective replica items from the film&#x27;s Hollywood premiere was released on November 5, 2024, to celebrate the film&#x27;s 85th anniversary.

===Re-releases===
Although the 1949 re-issue used sepia tone, the 1955 re-issue showed the Kansas sequences in black and white instead, a practice that continued on television broadcasts and home releases until the 50th anniversary VHS release in 1989.

The MGM &quot;Children&#x27;s Matinees&quot; series re-released the film twice, in both 1970 and 1971. It was for this release that the film received a G rating from the MPAA.

For the film&#x27;s 60th anniversary, Warner Bros. released a &quot;Special Edition&quot; on November 6, 1998, digitally restored with remastered audio.

In 2002, the film had a very limited re-release in U.S. theaters, earning only $139,905.

On September 23, 2009, the film was re-released in select theaters for a one-night-only event in honor of its 70th anniversary and as a promotion for various new disc releases later in the month. An encore of this event took place in theaters on November 17, 2009.
An IMAX 3D theatrical re-release played at 300 theaters in North America for one week only beginning September 20, 2013, as part of the film&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Warner Bros. spent $25 million on advertising. The studio hosted a premiere of the film&#x27;s first IMAX 3D release on September 15, 2013, in Hollywood at the newly remodeled TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, the site of the film&#x27;s Hollywood premiere). It was the first motion picture to play at the new theater and served as the grand opening of Hollywood&#x27;s first 3D IMAX screen. It was also shown as a special presentation at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. This re-release grossed $5.6 million at the North American box office.

In 2013, in preparation for its IMAX 3D release, the film was submitted to the MPAA for re-classification. According to MPAA rules, a film that has been altered in any way from its original version must be submitted for re-classification, and the 3-D conversion fell within that guideline. The 3D version received a PG rating for &quot;Some scary moments&quot;, although no change was made to the film&#x27;s original story content. The 2D version still retains its G rating.

The film was re-released on January 11 and 14, 2015, as part of the &quot;TCM Presents&quot; series by Turner Classic Movies.

The film was re-released by Fathom Events through &quot;TCM Big Screen Classics&quot; on January 27, 29, 30, 2019, and February 3 and 5, 2019, as part of its 80th anniversary. It also had a one-week theatrical engagement in Dolby Cinema on October 25, 2019, to commemorate the anniversary.

The film returned to theaters on June 5 and 6, 2022, to celebrate Judy Garland&#x27;s 100th birthday.

To celebrate the 85th anniversary, &quot;Fathom Big Screen Classics&quot; (now taken over from TCM) released the film January 28, 29 and 31, 2024, with a special introduction by Leonard Maltin and a preshow trivia game hosted by &quot;Oz Vlog&quot; host Victoria Calamito.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; received universal acclaim upon its release. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Nugent considered the film a &quot;delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters&#x27; eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters. Not since Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; has anything quite so fantastic succeeded half so well.&quot; Nugent had issues with some of the film&#x27;s special effects:

with the best of will and ingenuity, they cannot make a Munchkin or a Flying Monkey that will not still suggest, however vaguely, a Singer&#x27;s Midget in a Jack Dawn masquerade. Nor can they, without a few betraying jolts and split-screen overlappings, bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place.

According to Nugent, &quot;Judy Garland&#x27;s Dorothy is a pert and fresh-faced miss with the wonder-lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales, but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are on the move.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Variety&quot;, John C. Flinn predicted that the film was &quot;likely to perform some record-breaking feats of box-office magic,&quot; noting, &quot;Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfoldment.&quot; He also called Garland &quot;an appealing figure&quot; and the musical numbers &quot;gay and bright&quot;.

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type, it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment. The performances are good, and the incidental music is of considerable aid. Pictures of this caliber bring credit to the industry.&quot;

&quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: 

Some reviews were less positive. Some moviegoers felt that the 16-year-old Garland was slightly too old to play the little girl who Baum intended his Dorothy to be. Russell Maloney of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the film displayed &quot;no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity&quot; and declared it &quot;a stinkeroo&quot;, while Otis Ferguson of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote: &quot;It has dwarfs, music, Technicolor, freak characters, and Judy Garland. It can&#x27;t be expected to have a sense of humor, as well – and as for the light touch of fantasy, it weighs like a pound of fruitcake soaking wet.&quot; Still, the film placed seventh on &quot;Film Daily&quot; year-end nationwide poll of 542 critics naming the best films of 1939.

===Box office===
According to MGM records, during the film&#x27;s initial release, it earned $2,048,000 in the U.S. and $969,000 in other countries throughout the world, for total earnings of $3,017,000. However, its high production cost, plus the costs of marketing, distribution, and other services, resulted in a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio. It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about $ million in ). Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography &quot;Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland&quot;, wrote: &quot;Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.&quot; He also wrote that after the film&#x27;s success, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top ten box-office stars in the United States.

The film was also re-released domestically in 1955. Subsequent re-releases between 1989 and 2019 have grossed $25,173,032 worldwide, for a total worldwide gross of .

===Legacy===
The film was not the first to utilize color, but the way in which the film was saturated with Technicolor proved that color could provide a magical element to fantasy films. The film is iconic for its symbols such as the Yellow Brick Road, ruby slippers, Emerald City, Munchkins, and the phrase &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home&quot;. The film became a global phenomenon and is still well known today.

Roger Ebert included it in his canon of Great Movies, writing that &quot;&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it six decades later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them.&quot;
In his 1992 appreciation of the film for the British Film Institute, author Salman Rushdie acknowledged its effect on him, noting &quot;&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was my very first literary influence&quot;. In &quot;Step Across This Line&quot;, he wrote: &quot;When I first saw &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, it made a writer of me.&quot; His first short story, written at the age of 10, was titled &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. It was the favorite film of David Lynch, who referenced it regularly in his own work. The references Lynch made to it are explored in Alexandre O. Philippe&#x27;s documentary &quot;Lynch/Oz&quot; (2022).

In a 2009 retrospective article about the film, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; film critic and author Mick LaSalle declared:

...the entire Munchkinland sequence, from Dorothy&#x27;s arrival in Oz to her departure on the yellow brick road, has to be one of the greatest in cinema history – a masterpiece of set design, costuming, choreography, music, lyrics, storytelling, and sheer imagination.
In 2018, it was named the &quot;most influential film of all time&quot; as the result of a study conducted by the University of Turin to measure the success and significance of 47,000 films from around the world using data from readers and audience polls, as well as internet sources such as IMDb. It would top the list in their study, followed by the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) rounding out the top 5.

On the film review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; has a 98% rating based on 170 reviews, with an average score of 9.4/10. Its critical consensus reads, &quot;An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is a must-see film for young and old.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film received a score of 92 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Art&quot;.

==Sequels and reinterpretations==
An official 1972 sequel, the animated &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;, featuring the voice of Judy Garland&#x27;s daughter Liza Minnelli was produced to commemorate the original film&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

&quot;The Wiz&quot;, a musical based on the novel, opened in 1974 in Baltimore and in 1975 with a new cast on Broadway. It went on to win seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical. A film adaptation was released in 1978.

In 1975, a comic book adaptation of the film titled &quot;MGM&#x27;s Marvelous Wizard of Oz&quot; was released. It was the first co-production between DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Marvel planned a series of sequels based on the subsequent novels. The first, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, was published later that year. The next, &quot;The Marvelous Ozma of Oz&quot; was expected to be released the following year but never came to be.

In 1985, Walt Disney Productions released the live-action fantasy film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, starring Fairuza Balk in her film debut as a young Dorothy Gale and based on &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904) and &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907). With a darker story, it fared poorly with critics unfamiliar with the &quot;Oz&quot; books and was not successful at the box office, although it has since become a popular cult film, with many considering it a more loyal and faithful adaptation of what L. Frank Baum envisioned.

The Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot; premiered in 2003, and is based on the film and original novel. It has since gone on to become the second-highest grossing Broadway musical of all time, and won three Tony Awards, seven Drama Desk Awards, and a Grammy Award. A two-part film adaptation of the musical, directed by Jon M. Chu, entered development at Universal Pictures in 2004. The first film was released on November 22, 2024, and the second, &quot;&quot;, is scheduled for November 21, 2025.

Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice produced a stage musical of the same name, which opened in 2011 at the West End″s London Palladium.

An animated film called &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot; was released in 2011 by Warner Home Video, incorporating Tom and Jerry into the story as Dorothy&#x27;s &quot;protectors&quot;. A sequel titled &quot;Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz&quot; was released on DVD on June 21, 2016.

In 2013, Walt Disney Pictures released a &quot;spiritual prequel&quot; titled &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;. It was directed by Sam Raimi and starred James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. It was the second film based on Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; series to be produced by Disney, after &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. It was a commercial success but received a mixed reception from critics.

In 2014, independent film company Clarius Entertainment released a big-budget animated musical film, &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot;, which follows Dorothy&#x27;s second trip to Oz. The film fared poorly at the box office and was received negatively by critics, largely for its plot and unmemorable musical numbers.

In February 2021, New Line Cinema, Temple Hill Entertainment and &quot;Wicked&quot; producer Marc Platt announced that a new film version of the original book is in the works with &quot;Watchmen&quot;&#x27;s Nicole Kassell slated to direct the reimagining, which will have the option to include elements from the 1939 film.

In August 2022, it was announced that Kenya Barris would write and direct a modern remake. In January 2024, Barris confirmed that he finished penning the script and remarked &quot;The original &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; took place during the Great Depression and it was about self-reliance and what people were going through, I think this is the perfect time to switch the characters and talk about what someone imagines their life could be. It&#x27;s ultimately a hero&#x27;s journey, someone thinks something&#x27;s better than where they&#x27;re at, and they go and realize that where they&#x27;re at is where they should be. I want people to be proud and happy about where they&#x27;re from. But I want the world to take a look at it and I hope that will come through.&quot; This involved changing the time period to the present day and changing Dorothy&#x27;s home from Kansas to the Bottoms of Inglewood, California.

The 2024 marketing campaign for season 22 of &quot;American Idol&quot; is directly themed after this film, complete with a commercial featuring Ryan Seacrest and the judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan dressed as Tin Man, Dorothy, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow following the &quot;Golden Ticket Road&quot; to Hollywood. This was to reflect the show&#x27;s plans to visit the judges&#x27; hometowns throughout the season.

==Cultural impact==
According to the US Library of Congress exhibition &quot;The Wizard of Oz: an American Fairy Tale&quot; (2010):

&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; is America&#x27;s greatest and best-loved home-grown fairytale. The first totally American fantasy for children, it is one of the most-read children&#x27;s books ... Despite its many particularly American attributes, including a wizard from Omaha, [the 1939 film adaptation] has universal appeal... Because of its many television showings between 1956 and 1974, it has been seen by more viewers than any other movie&quot;.

In 1977, Aljean Harmetz wrote &quot;The Making of The Wizard of Oz&quot;, a detailed description of the creation of the film based on interviews and research; it was updated in 1989.

===Ruby slippers===

Because of their iconic stature, the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film are now among the most treasured and valuable film memorabilia in movie history. Dorothy actually wore Silver Shoes in the book series, but the color was changed to ruby to take advantage of the new Technicolor process. Adrian, MGM&#x27;s chief costume designer, was responsible for the final design. Five known pairs of the slippers exist. Another, differently styled pair, not used in the film, was sold at auction by actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer&#x27;s premium) in June 2011. One pair of Judy Garland&#x27;s ruby slippers are located in Washington D.C. at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

In 2005, one of the pairs of the ruby slippers was stolen while on loan to the Judy Garland Museum in Garland&#x27;s hometown. They were recovered in an FBI sting operation in 2018. In 2023, Terry Jon Martin plead guilty to stealing the slippers, but he was not sentenced to prison because he was in hospice care and had less than a year to live. At the time they were stolen, the slippers were insured for $1 million. In December 2024, they were sold at auction for over $32 million, more than $26 million above the previous highest price ever paid for a piece of entertainment memorabilia. The shoes are one of four authentic pairs that are still intact.

===Dorothy&#x27;s dress and other costumes===
In July 2021, Catholic University of America reported that a dress worn by Dorothy, believed to have been given to Rev. Gilbert Hartke by Mercedes McCambridge as a gift in 1973, was found in the university&#x27;s Hartke Building after being missing for many years. The university said an expert on the movie&#x27;s memorabilia at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History said five other dresses apparently worn by Judy Garland were &quot;probably authentic&quot;. The dress found at the university had characteristics shared by the other five, including a &quot;secret pocket&quot; for Dorothy&#x27;s handkerchief, and Garland&#x27;s name written in a specific style. The university said the dress would be stored in Special Collections.

Another of the dresses sold at auction in 2015 for nearly $1.6 million. Many other costumes have fetched six-figure prices as memorabilia. See List of film memorabilia.

===Theme park attractions===
&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; has a presence at the Disney Parks and Resorts. The film had its own scene at The Great Movie Ride at Disney Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World Resort, and is also represented in miniature at Disneyland and at Disneyland Paris as part of the Storybook Land Canal Boats attraction in Fantasyland. The Great Movie Ride was shut down in 2017.

On July 20, 2022, it was announced that Warner Bros. Movie World would be adding a new precinct based on the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;. It is to feature two coasters manufactured by Vekoma and will open in 2024.

<text>Nikolay Nikolayevich Krestinsky (; 13 October 1883 – 15 March 1938) was a Soviet Bolshevik revolutionary and politician who served as the Responsible Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Born in Mogilev to a Ukrainian family, Krestinsky studied law at Saint Petersburg Imperial University, where he embraced revolutionary politics. He became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1903, and two years later he supported Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik faction following the RSDLP split. Repeatedly arrested, he was exiled to the Urals in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. After the 1917 February Revolution brought an end to the monarchy, Krestinsky led the Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg before returning to Petrograd. He was named People&#x27;s Commissar for Finance and elected to the first Politburo. After the death of Yakov Sverdlov, Krestinsky also served as Responsible Secretary of the Russian Communist Party.

Krestinsky was an ally of Leon Trotsky and supported the Left Opposition. With the rise of Joseph Stalin, Krestinsky gradually fell from power and lost his positions in the government, save for his post as Soviet ambassador to Germany. He eventually repudiated his opposition and capitulated to Stalin. Krestinsky was arrested in 1937 in the Great Purge and charged with treason. He was found guilty in the 1938 Trial of the Twenty-One and executed.

==Origins==
Krestinsky was born in the town of Mogilev, in what is now Mogilev Region of Belarus in to the family of a teacher. His family was Ukrainian. He was educated at the Vilno (Vilnius) Gymnasium and studied law at St Petersburg University. After graduating in 1907, he worked for ten years as a barrister and barrister&#x27;s assistant.

==Rise==
Having become radicalised when he first entered university, Krestinsky joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in Vilno in 1903. From 1905, he supported its Bolshevik faction, led by Vladimir Lenin. He was arrested in Vilno in 1904, then again in St Petersburg in February 1905, but was released both times, pending a trial. He was arrested again, twice, during the 1905 revolution, but released under an amnesty. In total, he was arrested nine times. On the outbreak of war in 1914, he was deported to the Urals.

After the February Revolution, which overthrew monarchy in Russia, Krestinsky was chairman of the Yekaterinburg and Urals committee of the Bolshevik party, and was elected a member of the Central Committee in July 1917. After the October Revolution, he moved to Petrograd (St Petersburg) as deputy head of the state bank. In August 1918 – 1921, he was People&#x27;s Commissar for Finance.

In January 1918, during the dispute over whether to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to take Russia out of the war, Krestinsky was one of just two members of the Central Committee to vote to reject the treaty and fight a &#x27;revolutionary war&#x27; with Germany, but in March 1918, to avoid a split that might have driven Lenin, he ended his opposition.

In March 1921, after the early death of Yakov Sverdlov, Krestinsky received a sudden promotion to the post of Secretary of the Central Committee. He was also elected a member of the original five-member Politburo, and of the first Orgburo. At first, he was the only Central Committee secretary. In 1920–21 he was the senior one of three.

==Fall from power==
As the official responsible for party appointments, Krestinsky took a conciliatory line towards dissenters, for which he was openly attacked by Grigory Zinoviev, who was backed up by Joseph Stalin and others who later formed the Stalinist faction within the party. At the same time, Leon Trotsky was under attack from the same direction in a dispute over the role of the trade unions, in which Krestinsky backed Trotsky, against Lenin. At the end of the Tenth Party Congress he was sacked as the party&#x27;s responsible secretary in April 1921, and replaced by Vyacheslav Molotov (and a year later by Stalin), and removed from the Politburo, Orgburo, and the Central Committee.

During the powers struggle that followed Lenin&#x27;s death, Krestinsky supported Trotsky and the Left Opposition. He and Trotsky spent hours discussing the situation in the Soviet Union when Trotsky visited Berlin incognito for about six weeks in April–May 1926. Krestinsky told him that Stalin was &quot;a bad man, with yellow eyes.&quot;.

But on 27 November 1927, he wrote to Trotsky saying that he no longer agreed with the programme of the Left Opposition. In April 1928, he publicly repudiated the opposition, claiming that he had never been an active member, making him one of the first Trotskyists to capitulate to Stalin. 
== Diplomatic career ==
Krestinsky was Soviet ambassador in Germany from 1921 to 1930. In this capacity, he negotiated the first trade agreement with Hungary, in 1925, and the German-Soviet treaty of 1926. In 1930, he was recalled to Moscow and appointed Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, in place of Maxim Litvinov, who had been promoted to People&#x27;s Commissar. The post was an important and sensitive one because of Soviet Russia&#x27;s crucial and delicate relationship with Germany at the time, but not nearly as important as his previous posts.

==Show trial and death==
In March 1937, early in the Great Purge, Krestinsky was suddenly transferred to the post of USSR Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Justice. He was arrested in May 1937. In prison he was beaten unconscious, and, according to a doctor who worked in Lefortovo Prison, was beaten so badly that there was not any part of his back that was not discoloured by bruises. After a &#x27;confession&#x27; had been forced out of him, he was put on trial (as part of the Trial of the Twenty One) on 12 March 1938. While almost all of the other defendants admitted their guilt during the Moscow Trials, on the first day of the trial, 2 March, Krestinsky told the presiding judge, Vasili Ulrikh:
I do not plead guilty. I am not a Trotskyite. I was never a member of the &#x27;bloc of Rights and Trotskyites&#x27;, of whose existence I was not aware. Nor have I committed any of the crimes with which I personally am charged; in particular I -plead not guilty of having had connections with the German intelligence service.

The following day, he made a total reversal of his position:
Yesterday, under the influence of a momentary keen feeling of false shame, evoked by the atmosphere of the dock and the painful impression created by the public reading of the indictment, which was aggravated by my poor health, I could not bring myself to tell the truth, I could not bring myself to say that I was guilty. And instead of saying, &quot;Yes, I am guilty,&quot; I almost mechanically answered, &quot;No, I am not guilty.&quot;

Such a reversion was a rare episode in the show trials, of the late 1930s. It caused speculation that the person brought back on the second day was not Krestinsky, but someone recruited to play him, or that he had been hypnotised. He went on to &#x27;confess&#x27; that he was a German agent, and that he had met Trotsky in the Tyrol resort of Merano in October 1933 to receive instructions on sabotage. However, Trotsky was under constant surveillance by Soviet agents at the time and KGB records from the 1950s do not mention any trip to Merano. Trotsky told the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that he had never been to the resort and had not spoken to Krestinsky since 1927.

Krestinsky was sentenced to death and executed on 15 March 1938.

He was partially exonerated during Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s destalinisation program, when, on 27 October 1963, Izvestia carried an article by the former soviet ambassador to Great Britain, Ivan Maisky, praising Krestinsky as a &quot;diplomat of the Leninist school.&quot;. He was cleared of all charges during Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika reforms.

== Personality ==
Joseph E. Davies, who was the US Ambassador to the USSR in 1938, described Krestinsky in his memoir, &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; as &quot;a short-sighted little man with a rather repulsive face&quot; – but his view must have been coloured by the fact that he accepted the confessions by defendants at the March 1938 show trial, which he attended. He told the US State Department that &quot;if the charges are true a terrible sordid picture of human nature at its worst is being unfolded.&quot; Victor Serge, who knew him in the 1920s, wrote that:

== Family ==
Krestinsky&#x27;s Jewish wife, Vera (née Yugenburg), who worked as a doctor, was arrested in February 1938, charged with being the wife of a &#x27;traitor to the Motherland&#x27;, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
Their 19-year-old daughter, Natalya, a student at a Medical Institute in Moscow, was arrested in June 1939 and exiled to Krasnoyarsk territory for three years. She was &#x27;rehabilitated&#x27; in 1956.

<text>5-1-1 is a transportation and traffic information telephone hotline in some regions of the United States and Canada. Travelers can dial 511, a three-digit telephone number, on landlines and most mobile phones. The number has also extended to be the default name of many state and provincial transportation department road conditions Web sites, such as Wisconsin&#x27;s site. It is an example of an N11 code, part of the North American Numbering Plan.

5-1-1 services in the United States are organized by state or region. Some 5-1-1 services are limited to information for drivers regarding road conditions and traffic. Other services have a wider scope, also providing information on public transport, carpooling and other services.

==In the United States==
===History and implementation===
Beginning as a research project at the University of North Dakota in the Summer 1995, an Advanced Traveler Information System, known by its phone number #SAFE (#7233). This initial system provided the proof of concept for a statewide application across both North and South Dakota, and later Minnesota. This system proved that all interstates, and state highways, could be covered and information about these roadways could be provided to travelers on demand 24/7. After more than 5 years of around the clock operations, the principles that established the operational and business rules of the #SAFE program were adopted by the FHWA as the initial guidelines of what was to later become 5-1-1.

In March 1998, a 3-digit dialing code was launched in the Cincinnati–Northern Kentucky metropolitan area for the ARTIMIS project. The SmarTraveler service, operated by SmartRoute Systems for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet since 1995, had been using a 7-digit code (333-3333) which was available to landline phones in both Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky area codes, but cellular callers had to dial a separate code (*1) to access the same touch-tone traffic system. SmartRoute Systems and KYTC negotiated with the two active cellular carriers and Cincinnati Bell and reached an agreement on allowing a 3-digit code &quot;2-1-1&quot; (a number agreed by the carriers), making this the &quot;first in the nation&quot;. This implementation was seen as proof that wireless carriers could implement short-codes without a * or # prefix requirement, and led to a series of discussions with the USDOT and the FCC pushing the carriers to release the number (which they viewed as precious internal resources).

On October 2, 1996, Eli Sherer of SmartRoute Systems, along with representatives from ITS America, the USDOT Joint Program Office, and others met with the FCC regarding the possibility of reserving an N11 number nationwide for Advanced Traveler Information Systems. This meeting led to further discussions at ITS America and USDOT, and the information provided was used and molded into the USDOT petition to the FCC for a 3-digit code for ATIS. The USDOT petition (as noted below) did NOT request a specific N11 number; When the FCC ruling was made on July 21, 2001, the 511 code was &quot;ASSIGNED as a national abbreviated dialing code to be used exclusively for access to travel information services,&quot; and at the same time, the 211 code was &quot;ASSIGNED as a national abbreviated dialing code to be used to access community information and referral services.&quot; Therefore, the 211 code that had been in use in Cincinnati since 1998 was changed to 511.

As of March 2001, at least 300 telephone numbers existed for travel information systems in the United States. To overcome the confusion caused by this array of numbers, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a national assignment of a single three-digit N11 dialing code. On July 21, 2000, the FCC assigned 511 as a nationwide telephone number for intelligent transportation system (ITS) traveler information, along with 2-1-1 for social services. Its use is being promoted by the USDOT&#x27;s ITS initiative.

&quot;On March 8, 1999, the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to designate a nationwide three-digit telephone number for traveler information. On July 21, 2000, the FCC designated 511 as the United States&#x27; national travel information telephone number.&quot;

The first 511 traveler information system to launch was the Cincinnati area&#x27;s ARTIMIS hotline in June 2001.

The first statewide 511 traveler information system was launched across the state of Nebraska in October 2001.

Eight states, from Alaska to Maine, pooled resources and expertise to develop the 511 voice-activated phone service for travelers. Led by the Iowa DOT, the multi-state consortium received $700,000 from the Federal Highway Administration to help pay for system design and software development. Each state also provided a 20 percent matching fund, boosting total funds to nearly $900,000. In addition to Iowa, the participating states in the consortium (as of 2011) are Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Sacramento Area Council of Governments, and Vermont.

Individual states have the lead role in coordinating 511 deployments. National leadership is provided by the 511 Deployment Coalition. Led by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and including travel information experts from more than 30 organizations, the Coalition has developed voluntary guidelines for state transportation agencies to follow when planning 511 service for their states or regions. Other leading member organizations of the Coalition include the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), the Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITS America), and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

====California====
=====San Francisco=====
Preceded, in 1996, by &quot;TravInfo&quot; and 817-1717, travelers in the San Francisco Bay Area can use the 5-1-1 phone service, access transit and traffic information on a Web site, 511.org, which provides information on mass transit schedules and an interactive trip planner, which will provide an optimal routing between a given origin, destination, and optional time constraints. In addition, 511.org provides information on bicycling, ridesharing, and the toll road system FasTrak. 511.org is a service of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and was designed by the transportation engineering company &quot;PB Farradyne&quot;, a division of Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade &amp; Douglas, (later Telvent Farradyne). The system had a fair amount of controversy when it was announced that it would use FasTrak electronic toll tags to track vehicles as they traversed Bay Area freeways. 511 has since stopped using FasTrak toll tag data to provide driving times. Driving times are now derived from GPS probe vehicle-based traffic speed data that 511 purchases from INRIX, Inc.

In 2006, the Bay Area&#x27;s transit coordinator signed an $11 million four-year contract with defense contractor Science Applications International Corporation to operate the local 511 system.

=====San Diego=====
Users of the San Diego area have access to road, transit, and other information via the phone and Web. They can access transit information on a Web site, which provides information on mass transit schedules and an interactive trip planner, which will provide an optimal routing between a given origin, destination, and optional time constraints. In addition, 511sd.com provides information on bicycling, ridesharing, and the toll road system Fastrak. 511sd.com is a service of the San Diego Association of Governments, and was designed by the company ICx Technologies and PB Farradyne (now Telvent Farradyne).

====Florida====
Florida has an active 511 system that underwent an overhaul in 2009. Central Florida is claimed to have the most-used 511 system in the nation, on a per capita basis.

====Georgia====
This statewide Georgia Navigator system provides traffic, MARTA/GRTA and other public transport, rideshare, Clean Air Campaign, Atlanta and Savannah airport, Amtrak, Greyhound, weather and tourism information in an interactive voice response (IVR) format. Callers are also given the option of connecting to live operators at the Georgia Department of Transportation&#x27;s Transportation Management Center in Atlanta. Connecting to operators allows users to report traffic accidents to the Georgia State Patrol or local police or sheriffs, or request motorist assistance from the Highway Emergency Response Operators (HERO) program. Callers can also connect to adjacent states&#x27; 5-1-1 systems, including North Carolina&#x27;s.

In January 2011, the Georgia Department of Transportation launched a mobile application on the iPhone platform to provide iPhone users with a mobile option for up to the minute traffic information found on the website. The application also provides special offers and other information about businesses and organizations who participate in the program.

Georgia actually had a system for years before this, using only live operators, and the code *DOT (*368), which could not necessarily be used by those mobile phone users who were roaming from elsewhere, as these codes are specific to each phone company. A local 404 number in metro Atlanta and a toll-free 800 number were used for these and landline calls, and still serve as backup for mobile providers that fail to connect.

====Kentucky====
In Kentucky, 511 services cover traffic and weather conditions, and can also be heard on the radio on the AM dial (the Travelers&#x27; Information Station) and at 511.ky.gov.

====New England====
The New England 511 service covers Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, providing access to real-time traffic and weather conditions, live cameras, upcoming events and other relevant information. 

The service was launched in 2022, as a partnership between the Maine Department of Transportation, New Hampshire Department of Transportation and Vermont Agency of Transportation, with all three organizations continuing to supply updating real-time information. 

The site can be found at newengland511.org.

====New York====
511 New York is established and administered by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Basic service was launched in the New York City metropolitan area in late 2008. Statewide coverage and more sophisticated services will be added throughout 2009. 511 NY – &quot;Get Connected to Go&quot; is the umbrella brand of The New York State Department of Transportation for traffic, transit and travel information. The 511 New York theme line is: Get Connected to Go. The tag line is: New York State&#x27;s Official Traffic and Travel Info Source. The credit line is: A Free Service of the New York State Department of Transportation.

In the New York metropolitan area 5-1-1 provides information on bus, subway, and commuter rail mass transit systems in addition to road conditions and traffic information.

====Pennsylvania====
Pennsylvania&#x27;s statewide 511 launched on September 1, 2009. The system provides up to date information on all the states interstate highways. Travelers can also view road conditions and traffic cameras at 511PA.com.

====Tennessee====
Implemented in August 2006, Tennessee travelers have the option of accessing road and travel conditions at TN511.com or through the 511 phone service.

====Virginia====
The FCC designated 511 as the national traveler information number. Virginia&#x27;s 511 system began in the Shenandoah Valley in 2000 and went statewide in early 2005. Currently both the 511virginia.org website and calling 511 from any land line or mobile phone provides statewide travelling information. Alternatively, there is now a 511 VDOT app for iOS and Android devices.

====West Virginia====
The West Virginia Department of Transportation&#x27;s (WVDOT) free 511 Traveler Information System provides real-time traffic information, including congestion, construction, lane closures, road conditions and severe weather information on all West Virginia interstates and other major highways. The resource is available 24 hours a day via phone by dialing 511 or online at WV511.org. WV 511 advisories also are available from the WV 511 Drive Safe mobile app and via statewide, regional and roadway-specific Twitter feeds. The public safety alerts (such as Amber Alerts and Silver Alerts) carried on 511 are voluntary, cooperative partnerships among law enforcement, WVDOT, other agencies and local broadcasters. WVDOT uses overhead electronic message signs and 511 to get public safety alerts out to the public. 511 was implemented in West Virginia in 2012.

====Wyoming====
In the summer of 2007, the original vendor was removed and services were redesigned and improved using Meridian Environmental Technology. The effort to redesign and improve service undertaken &quot;summer of 2007&quot; to revamp WYDOT&#x27;s 511 Travel Information telephone service is paying benefits this winter, based on recent customer feedback.

Some of the additional features are:
*Ability to choose neighboring states that provide 511 information
*Voice recognition, with the option to revert to touchtone keypad input
*Ability to choose route-specific information or regional summaries
*Agency capability to include Alerts (Amber, Homeland, customized)

====Similar services in the United States====
The Minnesota Department of Transportation operates a website for traffic and road condition information.

=== Discontinuing services ===

==== Washington ====
The Washington State Department of Transportation launched the state&#x27;s 511 service in July 2003. On April 24, 2023, the WSDOT announced that it would deactivate the 511 telephone number within the state on May 19 of that year, citing declining usage (attributed to the use of smartphones and GPS navigation), old technology, and cost.

==In Canada==
===Implementation===
The Intelligent Transportation Systems Society of Canada (ITS Canada) has brought together a consortium, the Canada 511 Consortium, to help get 5-1-1 service established in Canada.

In January 2005, the consortium filed an application to assign the 5-1-1 access code in Canada. It proposed that in addition to traffic, the number would report weather, which also has a major impact on traffic, particularly in a country with such harsh winters. The application was approved by the CRTC in Canada on July 28, 2006.

In March 2007, an article in &quot;Computing Canada&quot; said it was up to each individual province whether or not to launch a 5-1-1 system, but that not all provinces were eager to proceed.

In May 2008, an article in &quot;IT World Canada&quot; claimed that the 5-1-1 initiative &quot;appears to have lost momentum&quot;.

British Columbia began loose implementation of 5-1-1 service in late 2009/early 2010. This replaced the interim mobile service provided by *4997 (*HWYS) which had been in place on Rogers, Telus Mobility and Bell Mobility. BC 5-1-1 service was available to Telus, Telus Mobility and Telus MiKE clients as of 2010. Full service NOT utilizing 5-1-1 is available via DriveBC (a government website/phone line) at www.drivebc.ca or by phone across North America at 1-800-550-4997 (HWYS).

Alberta unveiled its 5-1-1 road report service on February 4, 2013.

In Saskatchewan 5-1-1 redirects to 888-335-7623 which is the Highways Hotline, a Provincial phone information system with highway weather and impassibility information. The Implementation date is Unknown.

===Active systems===
Alberta, Manitoba,
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Yukon Territory each have 5-1-1 systems.
Most provinces and territories without 5-1-1 systems have other road information hotlines, accessible by dialing various phone numbers.

<text>8-1-1 is an N-1-1 telephone number in Canada and the United States. In Canada, the number is used for non-urgent health services. In the United States, 8-1-1 provides a uniform national phone number to access local utility location services.

== By country ==
=== Canada ===

In July 2005, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) assigned 8-1-1 for non-urgent health teletriage/telehealth services. In May 2008, the province of Quebec announced the adoption of 8-1-1 for this purpose, followed by the Yukon in July 2008, British Columbia in November 2008, Nova Scotia in July 2009, Saskatchewan in March 2013, Alberta in June 2015, Newfoundland and Labrador in July 2015, and Ontario in April 2022. Since 1997, New Brunswick implemented a province-wide Tele-Care service, adopting the 8-1-1 number in place of the toll-free 800 number in 2010.

Quebec has since supplemented its teletriage service (&quot;Info-Santé&quot;) with access to a social worker to deal with situations of psychosocial distress (&quot;Info-Social&quot;) at the same 8-1-1 number.

=== United States ===
In March 2005, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made 8-1-1 the universal number for the 71 regional services that coordinate location services for underground public utilities in the U.S. Before that time, each of these &quot;call before you dig&quot; services had its own 800 number, and the FCC and others wanted to make it as easy as possible for everyone planning an excavation to call first.

This safety measure not only helps prevent damage that interrupts telecommunications, but also the cutting of subterranean power lines, water mains, and natural gas pipes. Over 20 million miles of buried utilities exist in the U.S., and damages to these cost in excess of $30 billion annually. On average, an underground utility is damaged every six minutes due to a failure to contact 811 as required by law. However, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, using 811 services before digging projects results in a 99% chance of avoiding utility damages, injury, environmental harm, and death.

Underground utilities are located via color-coded markings typically up to and not past the user&#x27;s service connection or meter. Lines on the other side of the meter or service connection are considered to be part of the customer&#x27;s property and will typically not be located by these services. Establishment of an abbreviated dialing number for this purpose was required by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002.

The use of 8-1-1 for &quot;call before you dig&quot; services was long established in California and Nevada, through an organization known as Underground Service Alert, before the FCC mandated its use for this purpose. While &quot;call before you dig&quot; and the 8-1-1 phone number is the primary awareness campaign in the United States, Canada has switched to &quot;click before you dig&quot; to emphasize online locate requests and contacting one-call centers virtually rather than calling. August 11 is National Safe Digging Day.

== Previous uses ==

Prior to 2005, the FCC had never officially assigned 8-1-1 for any service, but did not prevent its use either. Traditionally, 8-1-1 has been a direct line to the business office of the telephone company providing service on the line. From there, one may perform some or all of the following operations:

* Pay the bill
* Order additional lines
* Order and cancel services
* Order and rent equipment
* Order calling cards
* Speak to customer service

Such services have been merged into 6-1-1. Mobile phones sometimes use 6-1-1 for this purpose as well. Many telephone companies, including Canada&#x27;s Telus, are experimenting with merging 8-1-1 and 6-1-1 service now that neither will usually route directly to a human operator. Generally, an automatic phone answering system or other automated attendant will now answer both lines anyway.

<doc id="561350" wikidata="Q3818457" url="?curid=561350" title="Children on Their Birthdays">
<text>Children on Their Birthdays is a 2002 American independent comedy drama film directed by Mark Medoff, and starring Sheryl Lee, Jesse Plemons, Joe Pichler, Tania Raymonde, Christopher McDonald, and Tom Arnold. The screenplay is adapted by Douglas Sloan from Truman Capote″s short story of the same title. This was the last film appearance by Pichler before his disappearance in 2006.

The film premiered at WorldFest Houston on March 23, 2002 and was given a limited theatrical release on October 18, 2002.

==Plot==
In the summer of 1947, thirteen-year-old Lily Jane Bobbit has moved with her mute mother to small-town Medda, Alabama, next door to Billy Bob Murphy. Billy Bob develops a crush on Lily Jane, who is a self-possessed Southern belle. Preacher, Billy Bob&#x27;s rowdy best friend, also takes a liking to Lily Jane, complicating the two boys&#x27; friendship. Meanwhile, Billy Bob has a hard time accepting the budding romance between Elinore, his war-widowed mother, and local mechanic Speedy Thorne, whom he and Preacher do odd jobs for.

The town is shaken up by the arrival of Lionel Quince, a con man. When the Quinces announce they are staging a talent contest, Lily Jane, who dreams of being an actress, enters the competition. When the grifters make off with the entry fees, it is up to Billy Bob and Preacher to catch up to the crooks.

==Cast==
*Sheryl Lee as Elinore Murphy
*Jesse Plemons as Preacher Star
*Joe Pichler as Billy Bob Murphy
*Tania Raymonde as Lily Jane Bobbit
*Christopher McDonald as Speedy Thorne
*Tom Arnold as Lionel Quince
*Phyllis Frelich as Mrs. Bobbit
*Brazha L. Brewer as Rosalba Cat
*Marilyn Dodds Frank as Mrs. Quince

==Production==
The film was shot in Aurora, Lemont and Chicago, Illinois.

==Critical reception==
Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it an &quot;unassuming, charming period piece&quot;. He added, &quot;Medoff gets fine work from his actors — note Tom Arnold&#x27;s amusing oiliness as a grandiloquent con man — and transcends obvious budgetary restraints to enhance pic with evocative period flavor and detail.&quot; Conversely, &quot;TV Guide&quot; said, &quot;Because director Mark Medoff and screenwriter Douglas Sloan never quite get under the skin of Capote&#x27;s quirky characters, especially the precocious Lily Jane, what should be a magically nostalgic tale seen through the eyes of a star-struck, small-town boy instead feels arch and brittle.&quot;

At WorldFest Houston, &quot;Children on Their Birthdays&quot; won the Platinum Award for Independent Theatrical Feature Films - Family/Children.

<doc id="561369" wikidata="Q17054254" url="?curid=561369" title="Getaway Special">
<text>Getaway Special was a NASA program that offered interested individuals, or groups, opportunities to fly small experiments aboard the Space Shuttle. Over the 20-year history of the program, over 170 individual missions were flown. The program, which was officially known as the &quot;Small, Self-Contained Payloads program&quot;, was canceled following the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster on February 1, 2003.

== History ==

The program was conceived by NASA&#x27;s Shuttle program manager John Yardley, and announced in the fall of 1976. The &quot;Getaway Special&quot; nickname originated from a special vacation fare for flights between Los Angeles and Honolulu being advertised by Trans World Airlines at the time around the program&#x27;s conception.

The first Getaway Special was purchased by Gilbert Moore of Thiokol on October 12, 1976, and donated to Utah State University. It was flown on &quot;Columbia&quot; during STS-4 in June/July 1982. The program was canceled after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster on February 1, 2003. The last Getaway Special, which was carried aboard STS-107, was the Freestar experiment package, which carried six different experiments. Much of the data was lost when &quot;Columbia&quot; was destroyed, but some data was transmitted during the mission.

After reorganization of the Shuttle Program, NASA cited the need for the remaining Shuttle fleet to complete assembly of the ISS to justify its decision to cancel the program. The GAS program canisters and GAS Bridge combined weight were only usable on low orbit missions, which were rescheduled with higher priority payloads. With payload and program limits set on the remaining Shuttle missions until the expected STS close-out in 2010, the GAS program was eliminated.

== Allocation ==
To assure that diverse groups would have access to space, NASA rotated GAS payload assignments among four major categories of users: educational, foreign, commercial, and U.S. government. GAS payloads had been reserved by foreign governments and individuals; U.S. industrialists, foundations, high schools, colleges and universities; professional societies; service clubs; and many others. Although persons and groups involved in space research obtained many of the reservations, a large number of spaces were reserved by persons and organizations outside the space community.

GAS requests were first approved at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., by the director of the Transportation Services Office. At that point NASA screened the propriety and objectives of each request. To complete the reservation process for GAS payloads, each request was accompanied or preceded by the payment of $500. Approved requests were assigned an identification number and referred to the GAS team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the designated lead center for the project. The GAS team screened the proposals for safety and provided advice and consultation on payload design. It certified that proposed payloads would be safe and would not harm or interfere with the operations of the space shuttle, its crew, or other experiments on the flight. The costs of any physical testing required to answer safety questions before launch were borne by the GAS customer.

== Requirements ==

There were no stringent requirements to qualify for participation in the GAS program. However, each payload was required to meet specific safety criteria, have been screened for its propriety, as well as being evaluated for its educational, scientific or technological objectives. These guidelines preclude commemorative items, such as medallions, that are intended for sale as objects that have flown in space. NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program had specific standards and conditions relating to GAS payloads. Payloads were required to have fit into NASA standard containers and weigh no more than . Two or more experiments could have been included in a single container if they fit while not exceeding weight limitations. The payload must have been self-powered, as experiments could not draw on the Shuttle orbiter&#x27;s electricity. In addition, the crew&#x27;s involvement with GAS payloads was limited to six simple activities (such as turning on and off up to three payload switches), due to the fact that crew activity schedules do not provide opportunities to either monitor or service GAS payloads in flight.

The cost of this unique service depended on the size and weight of the experiment. Getaway specials of and cost $10,000; and , $5,000; and and , $3,000. The weight of the GAS container, experiment mounting plate and its attachment screws, and all hardware regularly supplied by NASA was not charged to the experimenter&#x27;s weight allowance.

The GAS container provided internal pressure, which could be varied from near vacuum to about one atmosphere. The bottom and sides of the container were always thermally insulated, and the top may have been insulated or not, depending on the specific experiment. A lid that could be opened, or one with a window, may be required, and were offered as options at additional cost. The GAS containers were made of aluminum, and the circular end plates are 5⁄8 inch (16 mm) thick aluminum. The bottom of the container were reserved for NASA interface equipment, such as command decoders and pressure regulating systems. The container was a pressure vessel that could be evacuated before or during launch, or on orbit, and could be re-pressurized during re-entry, or on orbit, as required by the experimenter.

The getaway bridge, which was capable of holding 12 canisters, made its maiden flight on STS-61-C. The aluminum bridge fit across the payload bay of the orbiter and offered a convenient and economic way of flying several GAS canisters.

== Example of GAS experiments ==
* STS-7 - Pugas
* STS-40 - G-616 Cosmic Radiation Effects on Floppy Disks
* STS-47 - Project POSTAR
* STS-61-C - 1986: Vertical Horizons (G-481)
**Ellery Kurtz, artist, and Howard Wishnow, Project Coordinator. An art conservation experiment on board the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Included in the canister as part of the experiment were four original oil paintings by Kurtz, and other artistic materials, in order to evaluate the effects of spaceflight on fine art materials.

<doc id="561380" wikidata="Q1439991" url="?curid=561380" title="New Frontier">
<text>The term New Frontier was used by Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy in his acceptance speech, delivered July 15, in the 1960 United States presidential election to the Democratic National Convention at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the Democratic slogan to inspire America to support him. The phrase developed into a label for his administration&#x27;s domestic and foreign programs.

In the words of Robert D. Marcus: &quot;Kennedy entered office with ambitions to eradicate poverty and to raise America&#x27;s eyes to the stars through the space program.&quot;
==Origin==
Kennedy proclaimed in his speech:
==Legislation==
Among the legislation passed by Congress during the Kennedy Administration, unemployment benefits were expanded, aid was provided to cities to improve housing and transportation, funds were allocated to continue the construction of a national highway system started under Eisenhower, a water pollution control act was passed to protect the country&#x27;s rivers and streams, and an agricultural act to raise farmers&#x27; incomes was made law. A significant amount of anti-poverty legislation was passed by Congress, including increases in social security benefits and in the minimum wage, several housing bills, and aid to economically distressed areas.

A few anti-recession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers, were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made in Social Security (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation. Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in school milk and school lunch distribution. The most comprehensive farm legislation since 1938 was carried out, with expansions in rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, farm credit, and marketing orders.

In September 1961, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established as the focal point in government for the &quot;planning, negotiation, and execution of international disarmament and arms control agreements.&quot;

Altogether, the New Frontier witnessed the passage of a broad range of social and economic reforms. However, proposed legislation which was considered more revolutionary languished in Congress. According to Theodore White, under John F. Kennedy, more new legislation was actually approved and passed into law than at any other time since the 1930s. When Congress recessed in the latter part of 1961, 33 out of 53 bills that Kennedy had submitted to Congress were enacted. A year later, 40 out of 54 bills that the Kennedy Administration had proposed were passed by Congress, and in 1963, 35 out of 58 &quot;must&quot; bills were enacted. As noted by Larry O&#x27;Brien, &quot;A myth had arisen that he [Kennedy] was uninterested in Congress, or that he &#x27;failed&#x27; with Congress. The facts, I believe, are otherwise. Kennedy&#x27;s legislative record in 1961–63 was the best of any President since Roosevelt&#x27;s first term.&quot;

However, the Independence Hall Association&#x27;s website U.S. History.org describes then-Vice President and future U.S. President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society as the &quot;largest reform agenda since Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal&quot; and as what also managed to &quot;complete the unfinished work of JFK&#x27;s New Frontier.&quot; In his book &quot;John F. Kennedy on Leadership&quot;, John A. Barnes stated Congress in fact passed few of Kennedy&#x27;s New Frontier proposals during his lifetime, with major initiatives not being enacted until 1964 and 1965, during Johnson&#x27;s Presidency. The United States Department of Labor also stated that Johnson &quot;immediately set about to enact the balance of Kennedy&#x27;s New Frontier&quot; after taking office following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. It has also been acknowledged that during his presidency, Kennedy had placed Johnson, a former Senate Majority Leader, in charge of getting his New Frontier proposals passed through Congress.

==Advisors==
Historians and political scientists were given prominent positions within the Kennedy administration. Several themes that were popular in the post-World War II American histories were apparent during the administration and also reflected in the television series &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was an important figure in the post-war efforts to create a &quot;moderately liberal domestic consensus&quot;. Beginning in 1961, Schlesinger served as a special assistant to Kennedy. He was a member of the liberal lobbying group Americans for Democratic Action and in 1949 he published &quot;The Vital Center&quot;, a book which has been described as &quot;a manifesto for anticommunist liberals, defining an agenda that combined the social concerns of the New Deal with support for the Cold War policy of containment of Soviet power.&quot;

Within Schlesinger&#x27;s analytical framework of the domestic politics of the United States during this period he identifies three main ideological currents: 1) what he calls the &quot;vital center&quot; are the &quot;New Deal liberals&quot; who had been gaining ground politically since 1933, 2) right-wing racial extremists mostly confined to the Southern regions of the United States, and 3) Communists who Schlesinger identifies as posing the &quot;primary opposition to American values from within and without&quot;. Schlesinger, working on Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1960, sought an image of the candidate that would show the candidate&#x27;s personal and individual accomplishment as counter to a collectivist ethos. Schlesinger&#x27;s work along with Richard Neustadt&#x27;s and other thinkers were key influences in the development of the New Frontier-era policies.

==Legislation and programs==
===Economy===
The Kennedy Administration pushed an economic stimulus program through congress in an effort to kick-start the American economy following an economic downturn. On February 2, 1961, Kennedy sent a comprehensive Economic Message to Congress which had been in preparation for several weeks. The legislative proposals put forward in this message included:
#The addition of a temporary thirteen-week supplement to jobless benefits,
#The extension of aid to the children of unemployed workers,
#The redevelopment of distressed areas,
#An increase in Social Security payments and the encouragement of earlier retirement,
#An increase in the minimum wage and an extension in coverage,
#The provision of emergency relief to feed grain farmers, and
#The financing of a comprehensive home building and slum clearance program.

The following month, the first of these seven measures became law, and the remaining six measures had been signed by the end of June. Altogether, the economic stimulus program provided an estimated 420,000 construction jobs under a new Housing Act, $175 million in higher wages for those below the new minimum, over $400 million in aid to over 1,000 distressed counties, over $200 million in extra welfare payments to 750,000 children and their parents, and nearly $800 million in extended unemployment benefits for nearly three million unemployed Americans.

* Under his own presidential authority, Kennedy carried out various measures to boost the economy under his own executive anti-recessionary acceleration program. Through his own initiative, he directed all Federal agencies to accelerate their procurement and construction, particularly in labor surplus areas. A long-range program of post office construction was compressed into the first six months of his presidency, farm price supports were raised and their payments advanced, over a billion dollars in state highway aid funds were released ahead of schedule, and the distribution of tax refunds and GI life insurance dividends were sped up. In addition, free food distribution to needy families was expanded, state governors were urged by Kennedy to spend federal funds more rapidly for hospitals, schools, roads, and waste treatment facilities, the college housing and urban renewal programs were pushed forward, and procurement agencies were directed to make purchases in areas of high unemployment.
* In an attempt to expand credit and stimulate building, Kennedy ordered a reduction in the maximum permissible interest rate on FHA insured loans, reduced the interest rate on Small Business Administration loans in distressed areas, expanded its available credit and liberalized lending by the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Reserve Board was also encouraged to help keep long-term interest rates low through the purchase of long-term government issues.
* By 1964 economic recovery had begun, as low interest rates in mid-1962 stimulated a boom in the housing industry, while accelerated expenditures on veterans&#x27; benefits, highway building, and other government procurement programs revived consumer demand.
* The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorized the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis of up to 50 percent with the European Common Market. It provided legislative authority for U.S. participation in multilateral trade negotiations from 1964 to 1967, which became known as the Kennedy Round. The authority expired June 30, 1967, predetermining the concluding date of the Kennedy Round. U.S. duties below five percent &quot;ad valorem&quot;, duties on certain agricultural commodities, and duties on tropical products exported by developing countries could be reduced to zero under the act. The 1962 legislation explicitly eliminated the &quot;Peril Point&quot; provision that had limited U.S. negotiating positions in earlier General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds, and instead called on the Tariff Commission and other agencies of the U.S. government to provide the president and his negotiators with information regarding the probable economic effects of specific tariff concessions.

===Taxation===
Under the Kennedy Administration, the most significant tax reforms since the New Deal were carried out, including a new investment tax credit. President Kennedy said one of the best ways to bolster the economy was to cut taxes, and December 14, 1962, Kennedy stated at the Economic Club of New York that:

The final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963. I am not talking about a &#x27;quickie&#x27; or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peacetime; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking.

Kennedy specifically advocated cutting the corporate tax rate in this same speech. &quot;Corporate tax rates must also be cut to increase incentives and the availability of investment capital. The Government has already taken major steps this year to reduce business tax liability and to stimulate the modernization, replacement, and expansion of our productive plant and equipment. We have done this through the 1962 investment tax credit and through the liberalization of depreciation allowances—two essential parts of our first step in tax revision which amounted to a 10 percent reduction in corporate income taxes worth $2.5 billion.&quot; President Kennedy went on to say he preferred tax cuts for the rich as well as the poor:

Next year&#x27;s tax bill should reduce personal as well as corporate income taxes, for those in the lower brackets, who are certain to spend their additional take-home pay, and for those in the middle and upper brackets, who can thereby be encouraged to undertake additional efforts and enabled to invest more capital.

On the same evening, President Kennedy said the private sector and not the public sector was the key to economic growth:

&quot;In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the Federal Government&#x27;s most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures.&quot; President Kennedy told the economic club the impact he expected from tax cuts. &quot;Profit margins will be improved and both the incentive to invest and the supply of internal funds for investment will be increased. There will be new interest in taking risks, in increasing productivity, in creating new jobs and new products for long-term economic growth.&quot;

===Labor===
* Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1961 greatly expanded the FLSA&#x27;s scope in the retail trade sector and increased the minimum wage for previously covered workers to $1.15 an hour effective September 1961 and to $1.25 an hour in September 1963. The minimum for workers newly subject to the Act was set at $1.00 an hour effective September 1961, $1.15 an hour in September 1964, and $1.25 an hour in September 1965. Retail and service establishments were allowed to employ full-time students at wages of no more than 15 percent below the minimum with proper certification from the Department of Labor. The amendments extended coverage to employees of retail trade enterprises with sales exceeding $1 million annually, although individual establishments within those covered enterprises were exempt if their annual sales fell below $250,000. The concept of enterprise coverage was introduced by the 1961 amendments. Those amendments extended coverage in the retail trade industry from an established 250,000 workers to 2.2 million. According to one study, &quot;It was the first coverage extension of workers&#x27; hours and wages since 1938, the last year before the Conservative Coalition took philosophical control of Congress from Roosevelt&#x27;s New Dealers.&quot;
* An Executive Order was issued (1962) which provided federal employees with collective bargaining rights.
* The services of US Employment Offices were expanded.
* The Federal Salary Reform Act (1962) established the principle of &quot;maintaining federal white-collar wages at a level with those paid to employees performing similar jobs in private enterprises.&quot;
* A Postal Service and Federal Employees Salary Act was passed (1962) to reform Federal white-collar statutory salary systems, adjust postal rates, and establish a standard for adjusting annuities under the Civil Service Retirement Act. This legislation marked the first time that a consistent guideline for regular increases was applied to the national pay scales for federal white-collar and postal employees.
* The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (1962) established &quot;standards for hours, overtime compensation, and safety for employees working on federal and federally funded contracts and subcontracts&quot;.
* An 11-member Missile Site Labor Commission was established &quot;to develop procedures for settling disputes on the government&#x27;s 22 missile bases.&quot;
* A pilot program was launched to train and place youths in jobs.
* Paid overtime was granted to workers on government financed construction jobs for work in excess of 40 hours.

===Education===
* Scholarships and student loans were broadened under existing laws by Kennedy, and new means of specialized aid to education were invented or expanded by the president, including an increase in funds for libraries and school lunches, the provision of funds to teach the deaf, children with physical or cognitive disabilities, and gifted children, the authorization of literacy training under Manpower Development, the allocation of president funds to stop dropouts, a quadrupling of vocational education, and working together with schools on delinquency. Altogether, these measures attacked serious educational problems and freed up local funds for use on general construction and salaries.
* Kennedy used his presidential &quot;emergency fund&quot; to distribute $250,000 for guidance counsellors in a drive against school dropouts.
* Various measures were introduced which aided educational television, college dormitories, medical education, and community libraries.
* The Educational Television Facilities Act (1962) provided federal grants for new station construction, enabling in-class-room instructional television to operate in thousands of elementary schools, offering primarily religious instruction, music, and arts.
* The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act (1963) provided $175 million over a three-year period for matching grants for the construction of facilities for teaching physicians, dentists, nurses, podiatrists, optometrists, pharmacists, and other health professionals. The Act also created a loan program of up to $2000 per annum for students of optometry, dentistry, and medicine.
* The Vocational Education Act (1963) significantly increased enrollment in vocational education.
* A law was enacted (1961) to encourage and facilitate the training of teachers of the deaf.
* The Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961 enlarged the scope of the Fulbright program while extending it geographically.
* An estimated one-third of all major New Frontier programs made some form of education a vital element, and the Office of Education called it &quot;the most significant legislative period in its hundred-year history&quot;.
* The McIntire–Stennis Act of 1962 provided federal financial support to universities and colleges for forestry research and graduate education.

===Welfare===
* Unemployment and welfare benefits were expanded.
* In 1961, Social Security benefits were increased by 20% and provision for early retirement was introduced, enabling workers to retire at the age of sixty-two while receiving partial benefits.
* The Social Security Amendments of 1961 permitted male workers to elect early retirement age 62, increased minimum benefits, liberalized the benefit payments to aged widow, widower, or surviving dependent parent, and also liberalized eligibility requirements and the retirement test.
* The 1962 amendments to the Social Security Act authorized the federal government to reimburse states for the provision of social services.
* The School Lunch Act was amended for authority to begin providing free meals in poverty-stricken areas.
* A pilot food stamp program was launched (1961), covering six areas in the United States. In 1962, the program was extended to eighteen areas, feeding 240,000 people.
* Various school lunch and school milk programs were extended, &quot;enabling 700,000 more children to enjoy a hot school lunch and eighty-five thousand more schools, child care centers, and camps to receive fresh milk&quot;.
* ADC was extended to whole families (1961).
* Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) replaced the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program, as coverage was extended to adults caring for dependent children.
* A major revision of the public welfare laws was carried out, with a $300 million modernisation which emphasised rehabilitation instead of relief&quot;.
* A temporary antirecession supplement to unemployment compensation was introduced.
* Food distribution to needy Americans was increased. In January 1961, the first executive order issued by Kennedy mandated that the Department of Agriculture increase the quantity and variety of foods donated for needy households. This executive order represented a shift in the Commodity Distribution Programs&#x27; primary purpose, from surplus disposal to that of providing nutritious foods to low-income households.
* Social Security benefits were extended to an additional five million Americans.
* The Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act (1962) provided self-employed people with a tax postponement for income set aside in qualified pension plans.
* The Public Welfare Amendments of 1962 provided for greater Federal sharing in the cost of rehabilitative services to applicants, recipients, and persons likely to become applicants for public assistance. It increased the Federal share in the cost of public assistance payments, and permitted the States to combine the various categories into one category. The amendments also made permanent the 1961 amendment which extended aid to dependent children to cover children removed from unsuitable homes.
* Federal funds were made available for the payment of foster care costs for AFDC-eligible children who had come into state custody.
* An act was approved (1963) which extended for one year the period during which responsibility for the placement and foster care of dependent children, under the program of aid to families with dependent children under Title IV of the Social Security Act.
* Federal civil service retirement benefits were index-linked to changes in the Consumer Price Index (1962).

===Civil rights===
* Various measures were carried out by the Kennedy Justice Department to enforce court orders and existing legislation. The Kennedy Administration promoted a Voter Education Project which led to 688,800 between 1 April 1962 and 1 November 1964, while the Civil Rights Division brought over forty-two suits in four states in order to secure voting rights for Black people. In addition, Kennedy supported the anti-poll tax amendment, which cleared Congress in September 1962 (although it was not ratified until 1964 as the Twenty-fourth Amendment). As noted by one student of Black voting in the South, in relation to the attempts by the Kennedy Administration to promote civil rights, &quot;Whereas the Eisenhower lawyers had moved deliberately, the Kennedy-Johnson attorneys pushed the judiciary far more earnestly.&quot;
* Executive Order 10925 (issued in 1961) combined the federal employment and government contractor agencies into a unified Committee on Equal Employment opportunity (CEEO). This new committee helped to put an end to segregation and discriminatory employment practices (such as only employing African-Americans for low-skilled jobs) in a number of workplaces across the United States.
* Executive Order 11063 banned discrimination in federally funded housing.
* The Interstate Commerce Commission made Jim Crow illegal in interstate transportation, having been put under pressure to do so by both the Freedom Riders and the Department of Justice.
* Employment of African-Americans in federal jobs such as in the Post office, the Navy, and the Veterans Administration as a result of the Kennedy Administration&#x27;s affirmative action policies.
* The Kennedy Administration forbade government contractors from discriminating against any applicant or employee for employment on the grounds of national origin, color, creed, or race.
* The Plan for Progress was launched by the CEEO to persuade large employers to adopt equal opportunity practices. By 1964 268 firms with 8 million employees had signed on to this, while a nationwide study covering the period from May 1961 to June 1963 of 103 corporations &quot;showed a Negro gain from 28,940 to 42,738 salaried and from 171,021 to 198,161 hourly paid jobs&quot;.

===Housing===
* The most comprehensive housing and urban renewal program in American history up until that point was carried out, including the first major provisions for middle-income housing, protection of urban open spaces, public mass transit, and private low-income housing.
*Omnibus Housing Bill 1961. In March 1961 President Kennedy sent Congress a special message, proposing an ambitious and complex housing program to spur the economy, revitalize cities, and provide affordable housing for middle- and low-income families. The bill proposed spending $3.19 billion and placed major emphasis on improving the existing housing supply, instead of on new housing starts, and creating a cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Affairs to oversee the programs. The bill also promised to make the Federal Housing Administration a full partner in urban renewal program by authorizing mortgage loans to finance rehabilitation of homes and urban renewal Committee on housing combined programs for housing, mass transportation, and open space land bills into a single bill.
* Urban renewal grants were increased from $2 to $4 million, while an additional 100,000 units of public housing were constructed.
* Opportunities were provided for coordinated planning of community development: technical assistance to state and local governments.
* Under the Kennedy Administration, there was a change of focus from a wrecker ball approach to small rehabilitation projects in order to preserve existing &#x27;urban textures&#x27;.
* Funds for housing for the elderly were increased.
* Title V of the Housing Act was amended (1961) to make nonfarm rural residents eligible for direct housing loans from the Farmers Home Administration. These changes extended the housing program to towns with a population of up to 2,500.
* The Senior Citizens Housing Act (1962) established loans for low-rent apartment projects which were &quot;designed to meet the needs of people age 62 and over&quot;.

===Unemployment===
* To help the unemployed, Kennedy broadened the distribution of surplus food, created a &quot;pilot&quot; Food Stamp program for poor Americans, directed that preference be given to distressed areas in defense contracts, and expanded the services of U.S. Employment Offices.
* Social security benefits were extended to each child whose father was unemployed.
* The first accelerated public works program for areas of unemployment since the New Deal was launched.
* The first full-scale modernization and expansion of the vocational education laws since 1946 were carried out.
* Federal grants were provided to the states enabling them to extend the period covered by unemployment benefit.
* The Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 authorized a three-year program aimed at retraining workers displaced by new technology. The bill did not exclude employed workers from benefiting and it authorized a training allowance for unemployed participants. Even though 200,000 people were recruited, there was minimal impact, comparatively. The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394 million spending package passed in 1961, followed a strategy of investing in the private sector to stimulate new job creation. It specifically targeted businesses in urban and rural depressed areas and authorized $4.5 million annually over four years for vocational training programs.
* The 1963 amendments to the National Defense Education Act included $731 million in appropriations to states and localities maintaining vocational training programs.

===Health===
* In 1963, Kennedy, who had a mentally ill sister named Rosemary, submitted the nation&#x27;s first presidential special message to Congress on mental health issues. Congress quickly passed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act (P.L. 88-164), beginning a new era in Federal support for mental health services. The National Institute of Mental Health assumed responsibility for monitoring community mental health centers programs. This measure was a great success as there was a sixfold increase in people using Mental Health facilities.
* A Medical Health Bill for the Aged (later known as Medicare) was proposed, but Congress failed to enact it.
* The Community Health Services and Facilities Act (1961) increased the amount of funds available for nursing home construction and extended the research and demonstration grant program to other medical facilities.
* The Health Services for Agricultural Migratory Workers Act (1962) established &quot;a program of federal grants for family clinics and other health services for migrant workers and their families&quot;.
* The first major amendments to the food and drug safety laws since 1938 were carried out. The Drug Amendments of 1962 amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (1938) by strengthening the provisions related to the regulation of therapeutic drugs. The Act required evidence that new drugs proposed for marketing were both safe and effective, and required improved manufacturing processes and procedures.
* The responsibilities of the Food and Drug Administration were significantly enlarged by the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments (1962).
* The Vaccination Assistance Act (1962) provided for the vaccination of millions of children against a number of diseases.
* The Social Security Act Amendments of 1963 improved medical services for disabled children and established a new project grant program to improve prenatal care for women from low-income families with very high risks of mental disability and other birth defects. Authorizations for grants to the states under the Maternal and Child Health and Crippled Children&#x27;s programs were also increased and a research grant program was added.
*The Mental Retardation Facilities Construction Act of 1963 authorized federal support for the construction of university-affiliated training facilities, mental disability research centers, and community service facilities for adults and children with mental disability.

===Equal rights for women===
The Presidential Commission on the Status of Women was an advisory commission established on December 14, 1961, by Kennedy to investigate questions regarding women&#x27;s equality in education, in the workplace, and under the law. The commission, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt until her death in 1962, was composed of 26 members including legislators, labor union activists and philanthropists who were active in women&#x27;s rights issues. The main purpose of the committee was to document and examine employment policies in place for women. The commission&#x27;s final report, &quot;American Woman&quot; (also known as the &quot;Peterson Report&quot; after the commission&#x27;s second chair, Esther Peterson), was issued in October 1963 and documented widespread discrimination against women in the workplace. Among the practices addressed by the group were labor laws pertaining to hours and wages, the quality of legal representation for women, the lack of education and counseling for working women, and federal insurance and tax laws that affected women&#x27;s incomes. Recommendations included affordable child care for all income levels, hiring practices that promoted equal opportunity for women, and paid maternity leave.

The commission, reflecting the views of Roosevelt and the labor unions, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). They feared the ERA would end the special privileges needed by women and accorded to women that were not given to men.

In the early 1960s, full-time working women were paid on average 59 percent of the earnings of their male counterparts. In order to eliminate some forms of sex-based pay discrimination, Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law on June 10, 1963. During the law&#x27;s first ten years, 171,000 employees received back pay totaling about 84 million dollars.

===Environment===
* The Clean Air Act (1963) expanded the powers of the federal government in preventing and controlling air pollution.
* The first major additions to the National Park System since 1946 were made, which included the preservation of wilderness areas and a fund for future acquisitions.
* The water pollution prevention program was doubled.
* More aid was provided to localities to combat water pollution.
* The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1962 reiterated and expanded upon &quot;previous authorizations for outdoor recreation.&quot;

===Agriculture===
*A new Housing Act of 1961 extended the Farmers Home Administration housing loan assistance for the first time to nonfarm rural residents and providers of low-cost housing for domestic farm laborers. The Farmers Home Administration was therefore able to expand its rural housing loans from less than $70 million to nearly $500 million in 1965, or about enough to provide for 50,000 new or rehabilitated housing units.
* A 1962 farm bill expanded government food donation programs at home and abroad and provided federal aid to farmers who converted crop land to nonfarm income-producing uses.
* Title III of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962 consolidated and expanded existing loan programs, thereby providing the Farmers Home Administration with increased flexibility in helping a broader spectrum of credit-risky farmers to purchase land and amass working capital. In addition, the Farmers Home Administration assumed responsibility for community water system loans.
* Under the Rural Renewal Program of 1962, the USDA provided technical and financial assistance for locally initiated and sponsored programs aimed at ending chronic underemployment and fostering a sound rural economy. Loans were made to local groups to establish small manufacturing plants, to build hospitals, to establish recreation areas, and to carry out similar developmental activities.

===Crime===
Under Kennedy, the first significant package of anticrime bills since 1934 were passed. The Kennedy Administration&#x27;s anticrime measures included the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act, which was signed into law on September 22, 1961. This program aimed to prevent youth from committing delinquent acts. In 1963, 288 mobsters were brought to trial by a team that was headed by Kennedy&#x27;s brother, Robert.

===Defense===
The Kennedy administration with its new Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, gave a strong priority to countering communist political subversion and guerrilla tactics in the &quot;wars of national liberation&quot; to decolonize the Third World, long held in Western vassalage. As well as fighting and winning a nuclear war, the American military was also trained and equipped for counterinsurgency operations. Though the U.S. Army Special Forces had been created in 1952, Kennedy visited the Fort Bragg U.S. Army Special Warfare Center in a blaze of publicity and gave his permission for the Special Forces to adopt the green beret. The other services launched their own counterinsurgency forces in 1961; the U.S. Air Force created the 1st Air Commando Group and the U.S. Navy created the Navy Seals.

The U.S. military increased in size and faced possible confrontation with the Soviets with the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and with the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. American troops were sent to Laos and South Vietnam in increasing numbers. The United States provided a clandestine operation to supply military aid and support to Cuban exiles in the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion.

<text>Margaret Anne Jackson (born 17 March 1953) is an Australian corporate executive. She was the first Chairwoman of Qantas Airways from 2000 to 2007 amongst other company and charitable directorships. 

== Early life and education ==
Jackson was born in Warragul, Victoria, and studied at Warragul High School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree from Monash University in 1973 and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Melbourne.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Jackson began her career as an accountant and later partner in various accounting firms. She began work for BDO Nelson PArkhill in 1977 but soon became a partner at KPMG and later Pricewaterhouse (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) in the 1980s. In that time, Jackson would become a chartered accountant and fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (FCA) and also a fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors (FAICD).

In 1983, Jackson became the second woman to sit on the board of Telecom (now Telstra). She would become a director of the Australian Wool Corporation and later chairman of the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) in Victoria from 1993 to 2001. Jackson was also a director of the ANZ from 1994 as well as a director of Billabong from 2000 to 2011. She would continue much of her work as a director on various boards including St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Pacific Dunlop, the Fairfax Media and the Australian War Memorial, to name a few. 

Jackson left accounting in 1992 after she became a director on the Qantas board. She was also the first woman to become chairman of a top-50 publicly listed company in Australia when Jackson became chair of Qantas in 2000.

===Qantas takeover bid===
In early May 2007, Jackson faced mounting pressure to resign from the board of Qantas after the dramatic last-minute failure of the Qantas takeover bid by Airline Partners Australia. After the bid failed, she faced criticism that she had undervalued the airline, was reluctant to release upgraded profit forecasts and did not act in the best interests of the majority of shareholders.
Jackson was one of the most outspoken supporters of the takeover bid and, when asked of the ramifications of the bid failing, she famously stated, &quot;If anyone thinks this will happen without affecting the (share) price then they have a mental problem with how the market works.&quot; This was interpreted by some observers as an insult to shareholders and evidence that Jackson was actively lobbying for the takeover consortium.

On 17 May 2007, Jackson informed the Qantas board that she would &quot;retire from the board when her term ends at this year&#x27;s AGM&quot;, due to be held in November of that year. The board put its support behind Jackson&#x27;s decision to stay on until then because it ensured &quot;continuity and stability&quot; was maintained in the company.

John Howard, then the Australian prime minister, described Jackson&#x27;s retirement decision as &quot;a matter for her&quot; and made no direct comment, but expressed his support and confidence in her. Following the collapse of the Qantas sale bid, a number of highly respected businesspeople and personalities spoke out in support of Jackson, including Sir Rod Eddington (former chief executive officer of British Airways) and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett.

As Qantas&#x27;s business performance has deteriorated, and with it the company&#x27;s stock price, opinions on Jackson and her support of the sale bid have shifted. By May 2008, the share price had fallen by over 40 per cent since the takeover period with the bid price sitting at a 33-per-cent premium. Many media commentators such as Jennifer Hewett have suggested Jackson had been correct in her assertions that the takeover offer was a good deal for shareholders. The increasing difficulties surrounding Qantas seen in 2013 and 2014 led to further public comments by commentators in support of Jackson&#x27;s actions and comments surrounding the proposed Qantas sale – &quot;Meanwhile, former Qantas chair Margaret Jackson will no doubt muse on that $5.40 a share offer which was rejected just before the GFC. She was right, anyone who didn&#x27;t accept was mad.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
On the 5 December 2002, Jackson was granted an honorary doctorate of laws from Monash University.

In the 2003 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Jackson was honoured with the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) “&quot;for service to business in diverse and leading Australian corporations and to the community in the area of support for medical research, the arts and education&quot;”.

<doc id="561388" wikidata="Q1364808" url="?curid=561388" title="W. W. Denslow">
<text>William Wallace Denslow (; May 5, 1856 – March 29, 1915) was an American illustrator and caricaturist remembered for his work in collaboration with author L. Frank Baum, especially his illustrations of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Denslow was an editorial cartoonist with a strong interest in politics, which has fueled political interpretations of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Philadelphia to a tobacco wholesaler, Denslow spent brief periods at the National Academy of Design and the Cooper Union in New York, but was largely self-educated and self-trained. In the 1880s, he traveled about the United States as an artist and newspaper reporter; he came to Chicago for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893, and chose to stay. Denslow acquired his earliest reputation as a poster artist; he also designed books and bookplates, and was the first artist invited to work at the Roycroft Press.

Denslow may have met Baum at the Chicago Press Club, where both men were members. Besides &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Denslow also illustrated Baum&#x27;s books &quot;By the Candelabra&#x27;s Glare&quot;, &quot;Father Goose: His Book&quot;, and &quot;Dot and Tot of Merryland&quot;. Baum and Denslow held the copyrights to most of these works jointly.

After Denslow quarreled with Baum over royalty shares from the 1902 stage adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, for which Baum wrote the script and Denslow designed the sets and costumes, Baum determined not to work with him again. (As co-copyright-holder, Denslow demanded an equal share in royalties with Baum and composer Paul Tietjens.) Denslow illustrated an edition of traditional nursery rhymes titled &quot;Denslow&#x27;s Mother Goose&quot; (1901), along with &quot;Denslow&#x27;s Night Before Christmas&quot; (1902) and the 18-volume &quot;Denslow&#x27;s Picture Books&quot; series (1903–04). He also used his copyright to the art of the Baum books to create newspaper comic strips featuring Father Goose and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman during the first decade of the twentieth century. The strip, titled &quot;Denslow&#x27;s Scarecrow and [the] Tin Man&quot;, was intended to promote a forthcoming sequel he was writing. The strip ran concurrently with &quot;Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;. He also created the comic strip &quot;Billy Bounce&quot;, notable as one of the earliest comic strips in which the protagonist has some manner of super powers.

The royalties from the print and stage versions of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; were sufficient to allow Denslow to purchase Bluck&#x27;s Island, Bermuda, and crown himself King Denslow I.

Denslow wrote and illustrated a children&#x27;s book called &quot;The Pearl and the Pumpkin&quot;.
==Personal life==
Denslow had three wives and three divorces in his lifetime. His first wife, Annie McCartney (née, Anna M. Lowe, 1856–1908) married him in 1882 and gave birth to his only child, a son, the following year. The couple were already separated, however, and Denslow never saw his son. They finally divorced in 1896, freeing her to marry the man she lived with for five months. That same day, February 20, 1896, Denslow married Anne Holden Denslow, the daughter of Martha Holden, writer. The marriage did not last long either. Anne filed for divorce in September 1903, alleging that he told her in June 1901 that he did not love her and henceforth declined to live with her. In less than a month she married a young artist, their friend, Lawrence Mazzanovich, and left with him for Paris. Denslow then married his third wife, Mrs. Frances G. Doolittle December 24. Frances left him in 1906 and they finally divorced in 1911. He changed his will in 1914, leaving his estate to a fourth woman.

==Death==
Denslow died on March 29, 1915, in the Knickerbocker Hospital, New York City of pneumonia following an alcoholic bender with $250 () obtained from the sale of a cover to &quot;Life&quot;. The cover appeared on the July 1915 issue.

He was buried in Kensico Cemetery, in an unmarked grave. A cenotaph exists in Grove Street Cemetery, on the more elaborate family stone.

==Legacy==
In 2018, &quot;The Lost Art of Oz&quot; project was initiated to locate and catalogue the surviving original artwork John R. Neill, W. W. Denslow, Frank Kramer, Richard &#x27;Dirk&#x27; Gringhuis and Dick Martin created to illustrate the Oz book series.

Works by American artists began to be collected immediately following the museum&#x27;s founding in 1883. Today the collection is a strong survey of American history, with acknowledged masterpieces of painting, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts from the 18th century, 19th century, and 20th century, with contemporary American art in all media also being collected. The breadth of the collection includes American artists including John James Audubon, George Bellows, George Caleb Bingham, Alexander Calder, Mary Cassatt, Dale Chihuly, Frederic Edwin Church, Thomas Cole, John Singleton Copley, Robert Colescott, Leon Dabo, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, Thomas Eakins, Childe Hassam, Robert Henri, Winslow Homer, George Inness, Martin Lewis, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale, Tom Phardel, Duncan Phyfe, Hiram Powers, Sharon Que, Frederic Remington, Paul Revere, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, John Singer Sargent, John French Sloan, Tony Smith, Marylyn Dintenfass, Merton Simpson, Gilbert Stuart, Yves Tanguy, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Andy Warhol, William T. Williams, Anne Wilson, Andrew Wyeth, and James McNeill Whistler.

The early 20th century was a period of prolific collecting for the museum, which acquired such works as a dragon tile relief from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, an Egyptian relief of Mourning Women and a statuette of a Seated Scribe, Pieter Bruegel the Elder&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Dance&quot;, &quot;Saint Jerome in His Study&quot; by Jan van Eyck and Giovanni Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;. Early purchases included French paintings by Claude Monet, Odilon Redon, Eugène Boudin, and Edgar Degas, as well as Old Masters including Gerard ter Borch, Peter Paul Rubens, Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum includes works by Vincent van Gogh including a self-portrait. The self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh and &quot;The Window&quot; by Henri Matisse were purchased in 1922 and were the first paintings by these two artists to enter an American public collection. Later important acquisitions include Hans Holbein the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;, James Abbott McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot;, and works by Paul Cézanne, Eugène Delacroix, Auguste Rodin, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and François Rude. German Expressionism was embraced and collected early on by the DIA, with works by Heinrich Campendonk, Franz Marc, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Beckmann, Karl Hofer, Emil Nolde, Lovis Corinth, Ernst Barlach, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paula Modersohn-Becker, and Max Pechstein in the collection. Non-German artists in the Expressionist movement include Oskar Kokoschka, Wassily Kandinsky, Chaïm Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani, Giorgio de Chirico, and Edvard Munch. &quot;The Nut Gatherers&quot; by William-Adolphe Bouguereau is, by some accounts, the most popular painting in the collection.
In addition to the American and European works listed above, the collections of the Detroit Institute of Arts are generally encyclopedic and extensive, including ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian material, as well as a wide range of Islamic, African and Asian art of all media.

In December 2010, the museum debuted a new permanent gallery with special collections of hand, shadow, and string puppets along with programmable lighting and original backgrounds. The museum plans to feature puppet related events and rotation of exhibits drawn from its puppet collections.

==Architecture==
Before 1920, a commission was established to choose an architect to design a new building to house the DIA&#x27;s expanding collections. The commission included DIA President Ralph H. Booth, William J. Gray, architect Albert Kahn and industrialist Edsel Ford. W.R. Valentiner, the museum director, acted as art director and Clyde H. Burroughs was the secretary. The group chose Philadelphia architect Paul Philippe Cret as the lead architect and the firm of Zantzinger, Borie and Medary as associated architects, with Detroit architectural firms of Albert Kahn and C. Howard Crane contributing &quot;advice and suggestions&quot;.

The cornerstone for a new Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance–styled building was laid June 26, 1923, and the finished museum was dedicated October 7, 1927.

In 1922, Horace Rackham donated a casting of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s sculpture, &quot;The Thinker&quot;, acquired from a German collection, to the museum where it was exhibited while the new building was under construction. The work was placed in the Great Hall of the new museum building. Sometime in the subsequent years the work was moved out of the building and placed on a pedestal in front of the building, facing Woodward Avenue and the Detroit Public Library across the street which was also constructed of white marble in the Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance style .

The south and north wings were added in 1966 and 1971 respectively. Both were designed by Gunnar Birkerts and were originally faced in black granite to serve as a backdrop for the original white marble building. The south wing was later named in honor of museum benefactors Edsel and Eleanor Ford and the north wing for Jerome Cavanaugh who was Detroit Mayor during the expansion.

The building also incorporates a 16th-century French Gothic chapel, donated by Ralph H. Booth.

William Edward Kapp, architect for the firm of Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls has been credited with interior design work on the Detroit Institute of Art.

===Artwork===

Edsel Ford commissioned murals by Diego Rivera for DIA in 1932. Composed in fresco style, the five sets of massive murals are known collectively as &quot;Detroit Industry, or Man and Machine&quot;. The murals were added to a large central courtyard; it was roofed over when the work was executed. The Diego Rivera murals are widely regarded as great works of art and a unique feature of the museum. Architect Henry Sheply, a close friend of Cret&#x27;s would write: &quot;These [murals] are harsh in color, scale and composition. They were designed without the slightest thought given to the delicate architecture and ornament. They are quite simply a travesty in the name of art.&quot; Their politically charged themes of proletariat struggle caused lasting friction between admirers and detractors.
During the McCarthy era, the murals survived only by means of a prominent sign which identified them as legitimate art; the sign further asserted unambiguously that the political motivations of the artist were &quot;detestable&quot;. Today the murals are celebrated as one of the DIA&#x27;s finest assets, and even &quot;one of America&#x27;s most significant monuments&quot;.

The building also contains intricate iron work by Samuel Yellin, tile from Pewabic Pottery, and architectural sculpture by Leon Hermant.

===Renovation and expansion===
In November 2007, the Detroit Institute of Arts building completed a renovation and expansion at a total cost of $158 million. Architects for the renovation included the Driehaus Prize winner Michael Graves and associates along with the SmithGroup. The project, labeled the &quot;Master Plan Project&quot;, included expansion and renovation of the north and south wings as well as restoration of the original Paul Cret building, and added 58,000 additional square feet, bringing the total to 658,000 square feet. The renovated exterior of the north and south wings was refaced with white marble acquired from the same quarry as the marble on the main building designed by Paul Cret. The major renovation of the Detroit Institute of Arts has provided a significant example of study for museum planning, function, direction, and design.

==History==
The Museum had its genesis in an 1881 tour of Europe made by local newspaper magnate James E. Scripps. Scripps kept a journal of his family&#x27;s five-month tour of art and culture in Italy, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, portions of which were published in his newspaper &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. The series proved so popular that it was republished in book form called &quot;Five Months Abroad&quot;. The popularity inspired William H. Brearley, the manager of the newspaper&#x27;s advertising department to organize an art exhibit in 1883, which was also extremely well received.

Brearly convinced many leading Detroit citizens to contribute to establish a permanent museum. It was originally named the Detroit Museum of Art. Among the donors were James E. Scripps, his brother George H. Scripps, Dexter M. Ferry, Christian H. Buhl, Gen. Russell A. Alger, Moses W. Field, James McMillan and Hugh McMillan, George H. Hammond, James F. Joy, Francis Palms, Christopher R. Mabley, Simon J. Murphy, John S. Newberry, Cyrenius A. Newcomb, Sr., Thomas W. Palmer, Philo Parsons, George B. Remick, Allan Shelden, William C. Weber, David Whitney Jr., George V. N. Lothrop, and Hiram Walker.

With much success from their first exhibit, Brearley then challenged 40 of Detroit&#x27;s leading and prominent businessmen to contribute $1,000 each to help fund the building of a permanent museum. With $50,000 coming from Scripps alone, their goal was within reach. By 1888, Scripps and Brearley had incorporated Detroit Museum of Arts, filling it with over 70 pieces of artwork acquired by Scripps during his time in Europe.

Lasting as a museum less than 40 years, the impact the museum had on the city of Detroit was tremendous. The Art Loan Exhibition&#x27;s success in 1883 had led to the creation of a board. The purpose of the board was to raise and establish funds to build a permanent art museum in the city. Donating money to the cause were some of Detroit&#x27;s biggest names, including James E. Scripps, George H. Scripps, Russell A. Alger, and Sen. Thomas Palmer. The old Detroit Museum of Art building opened in 1888 at 704 E. Jefferson Avenue (it was finally demolished in 1960). The Detroit Museum of Art board of trustees changed the name to the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1919 and a committee began raising funds to build a new location with Scripps still at the helm. The present DIA building on Woodward Avenue debuted on October 7, 1927. While not officially declared the founder of the Detroit Institute of Arts, Scripps and Brearley were indeed the founders of the DIA&#x27;s predecessor, The Detroit Museum of Art. With the success of the arts, and the booming auto industry, families were flocking to the city; pushing for the need to expand the vision that Scripps had originally dreamed, a new building was raised and the DIA was born.

Another decision in 1919 that would have a lasting impact on the future of the museum was transferring ownership to the City of Detroit with the museum becoming a city department and receiving operating funds. The board of trustees became the Founder&#x27;s Society a private support group that provided additional money for acquisitions and other museum needs. The museum sought the leadership of German art scholar Wilhelm Valentiner. It as under Valentiner&#x27;s leadership as director that, the museum flush with money from a booming city and wealthy patrons, the size and quality of the DIA&#x27;s collections grew significantly. The DIA became the first U.S. museum to acquire a van Gogh and Matisse in 1922 and Valentiner&#x27;s relationship with German expressionist led to significant holdings of early Modernist art.

Valentiner also reorganized how art was displayed at the museum. Breaking with the tradition of organizing artworks by their type with, for example, painting grouped together in one gallery and sculpture in another, Valentiner organized them by nation and chronology. This was recognized as being so revolutionary that the 1929 Encyclopædia Britannica used an illustration of the main floor plan of the DIA as an example of the perfect modern art museum.
Support for the museum came from Detroit philanthropists such as Charles Lang Freer, and the auto barons: art and funds were donated by the Dodges, the Firestones and the Fords, especially Edsel Ford and his wife Eleanor, and subsequently their children. Robert Hudson Tannahill of the Hudson&#x27;s Department Store family, was a major benefactor and supporter of the museum, donating many works during his lifetime. At his death in 1970, he bequeathed a large European art collection, which included works by Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat, Henri Rousseau, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Constantin Brâncuși, important works of German Expressionism, a large collection of African art, and an endowment for future acquisitions for the museum. Part of the current support for the museum comes from the state government in exchange for which the museum conducts statewide programs on art appreciation and provides art conservation services to other museums in Michigan.
In 1949, the museum was among the first to return a work that had been looted by the Nazis, when it returned Claude Monet&#x27;s &quot;The Seine at Asnières&quot; to its rightful owner. The art dealer from whom they had purchased it reimbursed the museum. In 2002, the museum discovered that Ludolf Backhuysen&#x27;s &quot;A Man-O-War and Other Ships off the Dutch Coast&quot;, a 17th-century seascape painting under consideration for purchase by the museum, had been looted from a private European collection by the Nazis. The museum contacted the original owners, paid the rightful restitution, and the family allowed the museum to accession the painting into its collection, adding another painting to the museum&#x27;s already prominent Dutch collection.
In another case, &quot;Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin&quot;, which involved a claim concerning Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Les Becheurs (The Diggers)&quot; (1889), the museum successfully asserted that Michigan&#x27;s three-year statute of limitations precluded the court or a jury from deciding the merits of the case.

The museum was expanded with a south and north wing in 1966 and 1971, respectively, giving space for the museum to receive two big gifts in 1970, the collection of Robert Tannahill and Anna Thompson Dodge bequeathed the 18th-century French contents of the music room from her home, Rose Terrace, to the museum upon her death.

As the fortunes of the city declined in the 1970s and 80s so did its ability to support the DIA. In 1975, even with reduced staff, the city was forced to close the museum for three weeks in June. The State of Michigan provided funding to reopen and over this time period the state would play an increasing role in funding the museum.

A 1976 gift of $1 million from Eleanor Ford created the Department of African, Oceanic and New World Cultures.

By 1990, 70 percent of the DIA&#x27;s funding was coming from the State of Michigan, that year the state facing a recession and budget deficit cut funding by more than 50 percent. This resulted in the museum having to close galleries and reduce hours, a fundraising campaign led by Joseph L. Hudson was able to restore operations.

In 1998, the Founder&#x27;s Society signed an operating agreement with the City of Detroit that would have the Founder&#x27;s Society operating as Detroit Institute of Arts, Inc take over management of the museum from the Art Department with the city retaining ownership of the DIA itself.

On February 24, 2006, a 12-year-old boy stuck a piece of chewing gum on Helen Frankenthaler&#x27;s 1963 abstract work &quot;The Bay&quot;, leaving a small stain. The painting was valued at $1.5 million in 2005, and is one of Frankenthaler&#x27;s most important works. The museum&#x27;s conservation lab successfully cleaned and restored the painting, which was returned to the gallery in late June 2006.

As part of the settlement of the City of Detroit&#x27;s bankruptcy, ownership of the museum was transferred to Detroit Institute of Arts, Inc., in December 2014, returning the museum to its pre-1919 status as an independent non-profit.

In June 2020, Andrea Montiel de Shuman, a former DIA digital experience designer, made calls for greater racial sensitivity and honest interpretations of art suitable for young patrons came after Paul Gauguin&#x27;s painting &quot;Spirit of the Dead Watching&quot; was included in the multi-gallery show. The painting depicted a 13-year-old Tahitian girl named Teha’amana, who Gauguin took as his wife, naked on a bed. Gauguin was 44 years old. Montiel de Shuman, a Mexican woman, published an essay online announcing her resignation, citing &quot;Spirit of the Dead Watching&quot; as an example of the museum&#x27;s sub-par engagement with nonwhite audiences. Montiel de Shuman claimed the artworks&#x27; label did not address the possibility that the artist sexually abused her, gave her syphilis, and colonized her home. Montiel de Shuman, in an email to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, said &quot;[I] asked how the DIA was preparing front-line staff to handle conversations around power dynamics, colonial abuse, and sexual assault - particularly of minors.&quot; The museum did not publicly respond directly to Montiel de Shuman&#x27;s resignation, but released a general statement that they &quot;[do] not make media statements regarding individual employment matters.&quot;

In 2022, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the DIA&#x27;s purchase of the first Van Gogh work to be owned by an American museum, the Self-Portrait with Straw Hat, the DIA mounted a comprehensive exhibition of his work, Van Gogh in America. The exhibition received widespread press coverage, with Forbes noting that with 74 Van Gogh works, the exhibition marked the largest Van Gogh exhibition in America in a generation.

==Governance==
===Director===
The current director of the Detroit Institute of Arts, Salvador Salort-Pons a native of Madrid was previously head of the European Art Department at the DIA. Before coming to the DIA he was senior curator at the Meadows Museum at SMU and prior to that an assistant professor of art history at the Complutense University of Madrid. Salort-Pons holds a doctorate in art history from the Royal Spanish College at Italy&#x27;s University of Bologna and an MBA from the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. On September 16, 2015, Salort-Pons was named as director following the retirement of Graham Beal in June.

Despite the increase in yearly visitors to the DIA, some have criticized Salort-Pons in the belief that he is straying away from the &quot;visitor-centered&quot; philosophy pioneered by predecessor Graham Beal. Under this philosophy, the museum would make the art and interpretations of art more accessible to the general public to help them learn and connect with the pieces on display. Salort-Pons&#x27; Spanish origin has made critics believe he is unable to understand and tackle the complexity of issues surrounding race, inclusivity, and representation in the United States. The New York Times reported that Salort-Pons was taking steps to improve diversity despite his limited understanding of the Black struggle in America. In an interview with Artnet News, Salort-Pons said the commitment to improve diversity in the DIA included &quot;implementing diversity and community engagement initiatives as well as hiring qualified POC candidates. However, Lucy Mensah, a POC candidate hired by Salort-Pons, who served assistant curator of contemporary art in 2017, resigned due to a &quot;toxic work environment&quot; and believed that she and another former assistant curator were &quot;token hires&quot; because the DIA &quot;premise some of their hires as a way of diversifying the voices of the institution, but at the same time they don&#x27;t actually appreciate those voices.&quot;

In response to criticisms of Salort-Pons in 2020, some Detroit Black community activists and members of the art community in Detroit came to his defense. The Detroit News published an article in July 2020 in which Cledie Collins Taylor, a longtime Detroit art community figure stated, regarding Salort-Pons, that &quot;his outreach into the Black community is unprecedented.&quot; She noted further that &quot;Having come from abroad, he was so ready to receive and know the Black community.&quot;

===Marketing===
Besides holding major art exhibitions inside the museum&#x27;s 1,150-seat theatre and annual formal entertainment fundraising galas such as Les Carnavel des ArtStars in November, other Detroit Institute of Arts coordinated events include the annual &quot;Fash Bash&quot;, a leading corporate sponsored fashion event, featuring celebrities and models that showcase the latest fashion trends, typically held in the Renaissance Center&#x27;s Winter Garden, the Fox Theatre, or at the Detroit Institute of Arts theatre in August to celebrate Detroit Fashion Week. A 2012 survey showed 79 percent of the institute&#x27;s annual visitors lived in one of the three surrounding counties Wayne (which includes Detroit), Macomb, and Oakland. The museum&#x27;s annual attendance was 429,000 in 2011 and rose to 594,000 in 2013. In 2014, the museum&#x27;s annual attendance was about 630,000.

===Finance===
One of the largest, most significant art museums in the United States, the Detroit Institute of Arts relies on private donations for much of its financial support. The museum has sought to increase its endowment balance to provide it financial independence. The City of Detroit owns the museum building and collection, but withdrew the city&#x27;s financial support. The museum&#x27;s endowment totaled $200 million in 1999 and $230 million in 2001. The museum completed a major renovation and expansion in 2007. By 2008, the museum&#x27;s endowment reached $350 million; however, a recession, reduced contributions, and unforeseen costs reduced the endowment balance to critical levels.

In 2012, the endowment totaled $89.3 million and provided an annual return of about $3.4 million in investment income; while admissions, the museums cafe restaurant, and merchandise and book sales from the museum&#x27;s gift shop generated about $3.5 million a year, or just 15 percent of the annual budget. The museum raised $60 million from 2008 to 2012, reduced staffing, and reduced its annual operating budget from $34 million in 2008 to 25.4 million in 2012. In 2012, voters in three of the major metropolitan counties approved a property tax levy or millage for a duration of 10 years, expected to raise $23 million per year, saving the museum from cuts. In August 2012, the museum website expressed appreciation to the voters for their support. The Museum offers Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb County residents free general admission for the 10-year duration of the millage approved in 2012. In 2012, the museum established an updated fund raising goal for its endowment balance to reach $400 million by 2022 in order to be self-sustaining, while the millage is in effect.

The DIA art collection is valued in billions of dollars, up to $8.5 billion according to a 2014 estimate. After city&#x27;s bankruptcy filing July 18, 2013, creditors targeted a part of the museum&#x27;s collection that had been paid for with city funds as a potential source of revenue. Kevyn Orr, the city&#x27;s state-appointed emergency manager, hired Christie&#x27;s Auction House to appraise the collection. After months of determining the fair market value of the portion of the art that was purchased with city funds, Christie&#x27;s released a report December 19, 2013, saying that the collection of nearly 2,800 pieces of the then city-owned artwork, was worth $454 million to $867 million, with one masterpiece by Van Gogh worth up to $150 million. To prevent possible sale of the works, museum proponents developed what has been named the &quot;grand bargain&quot;. Under the plan, which was eventually approved, the museum would raise $100 million for its portion, nine private foundations pledged $330 million, and the state of Michigan would contribute $350 million for a total of $820 million in order to guarantee municipal workers&#x27; pensions. In return, the city of Detroit would transfer its portion of the collection and the building to the non-profit entity that already operates the museum. This plan was challenged by other creditors, who claimed that it treated them unfairly and requested to conduct their own appraisal of the museum collection. Some creditors came forward with offers from other parties to buy the artworks for sums higher than Christie&#x27;s appraisal. On May 13, 2014, Orr asked Detroit automakers to add $195 million to make the grand bargain stronger. The eventual settlement did not require the DIA to sell any art.

The discovery in 2014 that DIA President Graham W. J. Beal and Executive Vice President Anne Erickson received significant raises in 2014 and $50,000 bonuses in 2013 raised concerns among Wayne, Macomb and Oakland County residents. The DIA board notified suburban authorities November 4, 2014, that it reimbursed the museum $90,000 for bonuses awarded to three top executives in 2013.

On January 8, 2015, Beal announced he was stepping down on June 30. Months later, Beal&#x27;s pay continued to generate negative headlines for the DIA. Oakland County officials were at the forefront of opposition to a retroactive raise for Beal, even though the money was raised from private donations. Some local lawmakers hoped to make the non-profit DIA subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

Since the passing of the second millage in 2020, the DIA has been in a notably financially secure position among major American museums. In 2021, the current Director, Salort-Pons, and the chairman of the DIA Board of Directors, Eugene Gargaro, published a joint Opinion piece in Hyperallergic where they noted that the millage had created a unique funding model that allowed that museum to continue to fully employ their entire staff during the pandemic, where many other museums throughout the country were forced the lay off and furlough hundreds of employees. Salort-Pons similarly noted the museum finances in a 2022 interview with the New York Times, stating that in 2022, the museum&#x27;s finances have never been stronger.

<doc id="561403" wikidata="Q6826129" url="?curid=561403" title="Mexicantown, Detroit">
<text>Mexicantown is a neighborhood located in Detroit, Michigan, United States.

Andrew Eckhous, a columnist for the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot;, said that Mexicantown was &quot;one of Detroit’s most vibrant communities&quot;. John Gallagher of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; said that the commercial activity on West Vernor in Mexicantown is an example of what the Detroit Future City report suggested as something to replicate throughout the city.

==History==
Detroit&#x27;s Mexican population began settling in Mexicantown in the 1920s. The Mexican community established itself on Vernor Street. The community was originally known as &quot;La Bagley&quot;. The Holy Redeemer Roman Catholic Church began holding weekly masses in Spanish by 1969. At one point, the Lithuanian Hall building was renamed the &quot;Hispanos Unidos Hall&quot;. Waves of immigration came in the 1970s and 1980s, adding to the community. In the late 1980s, the neighborhood was christened &quot;Mexicantown&quot; as part of a public relations campaign. A wave of immigration from Mexico in the 1990s greatly increased the number of Mexicans in Detroit. In one period, Mexicantown&#x27;s population increased with seasonal immigrations of about 2,000 people, while Detroit as a whole had population decreases. Benedict Carey of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Mexicantown was &quot;on the rise&quot; in 2005.

In December 2012, Ford Motor Company announced that it would open the Ford Resource and Engagement Center in the &quot;Mexicantown Mercado&quot; facility and spend $10 million to finance the operations of the center. Prior to the Ford center opening, the building was closed.

==Composition==
The main thoroughfares are Bagley Street and Vernor Street. Meghan McEwen of &quot;Model D&quot; said, &quot;Nebulous are the borders of Mexicantown&quot; and that &quot;Some say it begins at the old train station and ends at Clark Park. Others passionately insist it includes Clark Park. More than a few people expand its spread all the way to Livernois.&quot; Vince Murray, the executive director of Vince Murray, argued that the community could include Springwells Avenue and that the name &quot;Mexicantown&quot; may be too limiting. McEwen said &quot;Perhaps even more important to defining the neighborhood, though, are its enviously unique traits and robust character, attracting visitors, as well as residents, from all over the state and even Canada.&quot; McEwen also said, &quot;Mexicantown is a place where vibrantly colored buildings, decorated with even brighter murals and hand-painted signs, dot&quot; Bagley and Vernor. As of 2011, there are many restaurants at the intersection of Interstate 75 and Vernor that cater to customers from the suburbs. Mcewen said, &quot;One might guess there are more restaurants per square foot than any other neighborhood in Detroit.&quot;

==Education==
The neighborhood is in the Detroit school district and is served by Western International High School.

Elementary-middle schools:
* Amelia Earhart Elementary-Middle School

The Cesar Chavez Academy charter school has area campuses.

The area Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit schools are Holy Redeemer School, a grade school, and the Detroit Cristo Rey High School, which is on the site of the former Holy Redeemer High School.

The Detroit Public Library Bowen Branch is in Mexicantown. It was named after a Detroit Library Commission member Herbert Bowen. It opened on December 28, 1912.

==In media==
A documentary called &quot;A Journey to Mexico&quot; was created, highlighting travels of people from two Mexican towns to the Mexicantown area of Detroit.

In the game &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot;, the protagonist Adam Jensen was fired from Detroit PD&#x27;s SWAT after an incident that took place in Mexicantown.

A documentary by Troy Anderson called &quot;Clark Park: A Detroit Story&quot;, released in 2017, tells the story of the Southwest Detroit community that saved a hockey rink, helped stabilize a neighborhood, and gave inner city youth the opportunity to play the game of hockey. This short documentary with a run time of 34 minutes is told through the perspectives of seven southwest Detroiters ranging from 12 to 87 years of age.

<text>Fernando Mezzasoma (3 August 1907 – 28 April 1945), also referred to as Ferdinando, was an Italian fascist journalist and political figure. He was deputy national secretary of the National Fascist Party and Minister of Popular Culture of the Italian Social Republic.

==Biography==
Mezzasoma was born in Rome, the son of middle-class Perugians; from his late teens he showed himself to be a passionate supporter of Benito Mussolini.

Mezzasoma had to contribute to his impoverished family&#x27;s income from early on, and took several jobs before finishing studies in accounting. A secretary to the lawyer Amedeo Fani, he was integrated to the state bureaucracy in 1929, after Fani became undersecretary to the ministry of Dino Grandi (the Minister of Foreign Affairs). In 1931, he joined the ranks of the National Fascist Party (PNF), and soon after became secretary of the Perugia branch of the Gruppi Universitari Fascisti (GUF), the fascist student organization.

The following year, Mezzasoma was appointed one of the local PNF leaders in Perugia (holding the position until 1935). He began writing for official magazines, such as &quot;Dottrina Fascista&quot; and &quot;Roma Fascista&quot;, usually under the pen name &quot;Diogene&quot;. Editor of &quot;Assalto&quot; in 1934, he became co-editor of the GUF mouthpiece &quot;Libro e Moschetto&quot;; in 1937, he published &quot;Essenza dei GUF&quot; (&quot;Essence of the GUF&quot;), a propaganda volume that was distributed throughout the network of Fascist youth organizations. During the 1930s he was vice president of the School of Fascist Mysticism.

A national deputy-secretary of the GUF in 1935, he was included to the leadership group of the PNF in January 1937, and became its deputy national secretary on February 23, 1939. When Italy entered World War II as an Axis Power, he volunteered for the 7th Artillery Regiment and fought in the Western Alps against France, being awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valor. In 1942, he quit the army to become the director of the Italian press; he continued in that role until 1943. Unlike a great many leading figures of the government (such as Galeazzo Ciano and Dino Grandi), he stayed loyal to Mussolini long after the July 1943 Grand Council of Fascism crisis which ended the latter&#x27;s rule in Rome.

With the foundation of the Nazi Germany-assisted Italian Social Republic, he was appointed Mussolini&#x27;s Minister of Popular Culture, and held this post until the Republic collapsed less than two years later.

He clashed with Junio Valerio Borghese and, on 19 April 1945 left for Milan, parting with his collaborators (including Giorgio Almirante). It seems that he had the opportunity to flee the region following Germany&#x27;s defeat, but would have refused, saying: &quot;I am a minister of Mussolini, I shall die with him&quot;.

Along with other fascist leaders and officials, at the end of the war he was captured near Lake Como while trying to make his way to Switzerland, and shot by the partisans in Dongo on 28 April 1945.

<text>Derrick May (born April 6, 1963), also known as Mayday and Is, is an American electronic musician from Belleville, Michigan, United States. May is credited with pioneering techno music in the 1980s along with collaborators Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, commonly known as The Belleville Three.

==Biography==
===Early life===
May is an only child born to a single mother in Detroit. May began to explore electronic music early in his life. At age 13, Derrick May began attending Belleville High School, and became friends with Juan Atkins in 1981. After an altercation, May became friends with Saunderson. Atkins taught May and Kevin Saunderson the essence of DJing as well, formed a trio, Deep Space Soundworks, collectively existing to present their favorite music at parties and clubs. In an interview with a French magazine, May explained that people used to laugh at the ideas that they were entertained by Kraftwerk and disco sounds, we did our thing and continued to believe in ourselves, regardless. During high school, Saunderson and Belleville High School classmate Juan Atkins were fans of DJ Charles &quot;The Electrifying Mojo&quot; Johnson.

When their careers took off, the three young men opened their three individual record labels, Metroplex belonging to Juan Atkins, KMS and Inner City for Kevin Saunderson and Transmat/Fragil all on Gratiot Ave, in Detroit&#x27;s Eastern Market, this was known as Techno Alley.

===Career===
When Derrick May was a teenager, he worked part-time in a video arcade.

May&#x27;s production career started in 1987 with the release of a record called &quot;Nude Photo&quot; (written by Thomas Barnett), which helped kickstart the Detroit techno music scene. A year later, he followed this release with what was to become one of techno&#x27;s classic anthems, the seminal track &quot;Strings of Life&quot;, which was named by Frankie Knuckles. It &quot;hit Britain in an especially big way during the country&#x27;s 1987–1988 house explosion.&quot; May&#x27;s best known track, according to Frankie Knuckles, &quot;just exploded. It was like something you can&#x27;t imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. Mike Dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesn&#x27;t have a bassline.&quot; The song was featured in video game &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot;.

Opened in 1988, The Music Institute in Detroit was where they held their residency. May describes the place as a spiritual place for music. &quot;We had a young beautiful black crowd and I mean beautiful in the sense of spirit mind and soul. We had white kids coming, Spanish kids coming, gay kids coming, straight kids coming.&quot;

Derrick was a mentor to many great artists. Among them, Carl Craig and Stacey Pullen have cited the difference between May&#x27;s two labels as Transmat being fully devoted to original creation, whereas Fragile is where an artist can utilize more sampling, for a little creative push. May also ran a side-gig collective known as KAOS, a separate and lesser-known endeavor from Deep Space. May&#x27;s Transmat Records label was the home of his best material, cuts like &quot;Nude Photo,&quot; &quot;Strings of Life,&quot; &quot;Kaos&quot; and &quot;It Is What It Is,&quot; most produced from 1987 to 1989 as Is . And though his release schedule all but halted during the 1990s, he continued DJing around the world and helping other artist to release their music honed Transmat into one of the most respected techno labels in the world.

In Surreal Underground Entertainment 1993 America, Carl Craig said he &quot;doesn&#x27;t want Americans to look back at the music and think of it as a down point in history. The majority of American artists sent their musical efforts to Europe because it is more accepted by a wider audience.&quot;

In the documentary about the Detroit techno scene, High Tech Soul, May notes that he saw people in Italy wearing Underground Resistance shirts and was surprised at the group&#x27;s success outside of Detroit. He says, &quot;People were going crazy over Underground Resistance, and it was like they weren&#x27;t even there.&quot;

Recently, May produced the music for the film of the popular fighting video game &quot;Tekken&quot;.

For two years, in 2003 and 2004, he was given control of Detroit&#x27;s popular annual electronic music festival. Originally conceived by Carl Craig, Derrick May, produced for 2 years. He named his event Movement, replacing the Detroit Electronic Music Festival along the Detroit city riverfront. Derrick May claims Carole Marvin stole the idea of festival from himself and Carl Craig. Her actions created a rift in the electronic music community in the talking a self-righteous stance, by firing Carl Craig. In 2004, Kevin Saunderson and Ade&#x27; Mainor produced the Festival of Sound Electronically and International Nurtured, in short: Fuse-In for 1 year in 2005. As of 2019, the Detroit Electronic Festival is operated by Paxahau.

Derrick May also still maintains a steady performance schedule, playing internationally many weekends. A pioneer of techno, he produces what he calls Hi-Tek Soul or &quot;George Clinton meeting Kraftwerk in an elevator.&quot; He has also cited Yellow Magic Orchestra, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Ultravox as influences.

===Sexual assault allegations===
In September 2020, May was accused of sexual assault by several unnamed women dating back to the early 2000s. May denies all allegations. In connection with the accusations, he also filed a lawsuit for defamation against Michael James, a collaborator on the track &quot;Strings of Life&quot;, who May believed to be pursuing a personal vendetta over unpaid royalties. The suit was later cancelled in February 2021.
