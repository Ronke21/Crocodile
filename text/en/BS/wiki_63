<text>David Carradine ( ; born John Arthur Carradine Jr.; December 8, 1936 – June 3, 2009) was an American actor, director, and producer, whose career included over 200 major and minor roles in film, television and on stage. He was widely known to television audiences as the star of the 1970s television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, playing Kwai Chang Caine, a peace-loving Shaolin monk traveling through the American Old West.

A member of the Carradine family of actors, he got his break playing Atahuallpa in the Broadway play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun.&quot; He appeared in two early Martin Scorsese films: &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; (1972) and &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973), and played Woody Guthrie in the critically-acclaimed biopic &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. He received nominations for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for his work on &quot;Kung Fu&quot;.

Later in his career, he became known for his B movie and martial arts roles, but experienced a resurgence after playing the title character in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot; duology. He received additional Golden Globe nominations for his performances in the television miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; (1985), and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004), for which he won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. On April 1, 1997, Carradine received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Throughout his life, Carradine was arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses, which often involved substance abuse. Films that featured Carradine continued to be released after his death. In addition to his acting career, Carradine was a director and musician. Influenced by his &quot;Kung Fu&quot; role, he studied martial arts, particularly Shaolin quan. In 2014, Carradine was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Carradine was born John Arthur Carradine Jr., on December 8, 1936, in Hollywood, California, the eldest child of actor John Carradine and his wife Ardanelle Abigail (&quot;née&quot; McCool) Carradine. He was a half-brother of Bruce, Keith, Christopher, and Robert Carradine, and an uncle of Ever Carradine and Martha Plimpton, most of whom are also actors. Primarily of Irish descent, he was a great-grandson of Methodist evangelical author Beverly Carradine and a grandnephew of artist Will Foster. Called &quot;Jack&quot; by his family, Carradine had a turbulent childhood. His parents divorced and repeatedly remarried; he was born during his mother&#x27;s second marriage of three, and his father&#x27;s first of four. At the time of Carradine&#x27;s parents&#x27; marriage, his mother already had a son by her first husband, whom John Carradine adopted. John Carradine had planned to have a large family, but later he discovered his wife had gotten two abortions without his knowledge, and afterward a miscarriage rendered her unable to carry a baby to term.

Against this backdrop of marital discord, Carradine almost died by suicide by hanging at the age of five. He said the incident followed his discovery that he and his elder half-brother, Bruce, had different biological fathers. Carradine added, &quot;My father saved me, and then confiscated my comic book collection and burned it—which was scarcely the point.&quot; After three years of marriage, Ardenelle filed for divorce from John, but they remained married for five more years. They divorced in 1944, when Carradine was seven. His father left California to avoid court action in the alimony settlement. After the couple had a series of court battles over child custody and alimony, which at one point landed John in jail, Carradine joined his father in New York City; by this time, his father had remarried. On December 25, 1947, Carradine appeared in a live telecast adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, with his father in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. For the next few years, Carradine spent time in boarding schools, foster homes, and reform school. He also often accompanied his father to summer theater throughout the Northeast. Carradine spent time in Massachusetts, and a winter milking cows on a farm in Vermont.

===Oakland===
Eventually, Carradine returned to California, where he graduated from Oakland High School. He attended Oakland Junior College (now Laney College) for a year before transferring to San Francisco State College, where he studied drama and music theory, and wrote music for the drama department&#x27;s annual revues while juggling menial jobs, a fledgling stage acting career, and his studies. After he dropped out of college, Carradine spent some time with the &quot;beatniks&quot; of San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach and southern California&#x27;s Venice. During this time he collected unemployment insurance and sold baby pictures. He was also prosecuted for disturbing the peace.

===Army service===
Despite an attempt to dodge the draft, in 1960, Carradine was inducted into the United States Army, where he drew pictures for training aids. That Christmas he married his high school sweetheart, Donna Lee Becht. While stationed at Fort Eustis, Virginia, he helped establish a theater company that became known as the &quot;entertainment unit&quot;. He met fellow inductee Larry Cohen, who later cast him in &quot;Q, The Winged Serpent&quot;. He also faced court-martial for shoplifting. In 1962, Donna gave birth to their daughter, Calista. Carradine was honorably discharged after two years of active duty.

==Film and television career==

===Early television and film appearances===

Upon leaving the Army, Carradine became serious about acting. He was advised to change his name to avoid confusion with his famous father. In an interview from 2005 Carradine says his father encouraged him going into acting: &quot;The first thing I ever did outside of school, which was a production of Romeo &amp; Juliet, he came up from Hollywood to San Francisco to see it. And right after he just sort of opened up to me with all this advice. He became very proud of me.&quot;

In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Secret Document X256&quot;. Several other television roles followed, including appearances on &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.&quot; In 1964 Carradine appeared as &quot;The Utah Kid&quot; on &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode &quot;The Intruders&quot;. Carradine got a contract with Universal. The studio gave him his feature film debut in &quot;Taggart&quot; (1964), a Western based on a Louis L&#x27;Amour novel. It also cast him in &quot;Bus Riley&#x27;s Back in Town&quot; (1965).

In May 1964, Carradine joined the cast of the Broadway play &quot;The Deputy&quot; by Rolf Hochhuth, replacing Jeremy Brett. When the play ended he was still under contract to Universal, and resumed TV work. He spent a lot of time playing, in his words, &quot;greenhorns in Westerns and villains in thrillers&quot;. Carradine guest-starred in &quot;The Trials of O&#x27;Brien&quot; in episodes that were cut together and released theatrically as &quot;Too Many Thieves&quot; (1967), and &quot;Coronet Blue&quot;.

===&quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;===
Carradine&#x27;s first big break came with his second Broadway part in &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;, a play by Peter Shaffer about the destruction of the Inca civilization by conquistador Francisco Pizarro. Carradine played Atahuallpa opposite Christopher Plummer as Pizarro. The play premiered in October 1965 and was a solid hit, running for 261 performances. Carradine said of this performance, &quot;Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was going to hire me was in that audience and had his mind blown.&quot; For that part, Carradine won a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance in 1965. He was also named as one of Theatre World&#x27;s Promising Personalities from Broadway and Off Broadway. (The play was filmed in 1968 with Plummer taking Carradine&#x27;s part.)

===&quot;Shane&quot; and supporting actor===
Carradine left the production of &quot;Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; in May 1966 to take up an offer to star in the TV series &quot;Shane&quot;, a 1966 Western based upon a 1949 novel of the same name, previously filmed in 1953. Carradine played the title role opposite Jill Ireland. &quot;I know I have some kind of vision that most actors and directors don&#x27;t have&quot;, he said, &quot;so it becomes a duty to exercise that vision. It&#x27;s a responsibility, a mission.&quot; The show only lasted 17 episodes, despite good reviews. Carradine said his career was &quot;rescued&quot; when he was cast in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1967). He was in demand as a supporting actor, mostly in Westerns: &quot;The Violent Ones&quot; (1967), &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot; (1969), &quot;Young Billy Young&quot; (1969) for Burt Kennedy, &quot;The Good Guys and the Bad Guys&quot; (1969) with Kennedy, &quot;The McMasters&quot; (1970), and &quot;Macho Callahan&quot; (1970).

In 1969, he performed off-Broadway in &quot;The Transgressor Rides Again&quot;, and the next year guest-starred in &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;. Carradine guest-starred opposite David McCallum in a 1971 episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;The Phantom Farmhouse&quot;. Also that year, Carradine played a hippie reprobate opposite Sally Field in the well-received television movie &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Come Home in the Spring&quot;. He also guest-starred in episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Ironside&quot;. He was unhappy playing villains, and told his agent he wanted to stop, which led to his not working in Hollywood for a year. He was cast in a musical, &quot;The Ballad of Johnny Pot&quot;, but fired two days before opening night on Broadway.

===&quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;===
In 1972, he co-starred as &quot;Big&quot; Bill Shelly in one of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s earliest films, &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;, which starred Barbara Hershey, his partner at the time. This was one of several Roger Corman productions in which he appeared. It was also one of a handful of acting collaborations he did with his father. He made his feature directorial debut with the film &quot;You and Me&quot;, starring alongside Hershey and his brothers Keith and Robert. It was shot in 1972, between making the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; pilot and the series, but released in 1975.

===&quot;Kung Fu&quot;===
For three seasons, Carradine starred as the half-Chinese/half-white American Shaolin monk Kwai Chang Caine in the ABC hit TV series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (1972–1975). The role was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award. Along with Bruce Lee movies, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; helped popularize the martial arts and Eastern philosophy in the west. Carradine&#x27;s character also brought the term &quot;grasshopper&quot; (referring to an apprentice) into popular culture.
Although the choice of a non-Asian to play the role of Kwai Chang Caine stirred controversy, the show provided steady employment for a number of Asian-American actors. In addition to Keye Luke and Philip Ahn, who held leading roles in the cast as Caine&#x27;s Shaolin masters, Robert Ito, James Hong, Benson Fong, Richard Loo, and Victor Sen Yung frequently appeared in the series. A second controversy was over whose idea the series had been. Bruce Lee&#x27;s widow claimed he had come up with the idea of a wandering monk in the Old West, but Ed Spielman, the series&#x27; creator, insisted that the concept was his own idea from years before Lee became a star. In an interview from 2005 Carradine disputed Bruce Lee&#x27;s claim: &quot;That&#x27;s mythology. I think the way that story started was that they got it mixed up with &quot;The Silent Flute&quot;. Not sure how that happened.&quot; In his authoritative biography &quot;Bruce Lee: A Life&quot;, Matthew Polly clarifies the issue of Bruce Lee&#x27;s involvement, concluding that the claim was the result of his not being cast for the leading role, and that he had no participation in the creation of the series.

&quot;Kung Fu&quot; ended due to several factors. It has been said that Carradine left the show after sustaining injuries that made it impossible for him to continue. While Carradine mentioned it when talking about his work in film, other causes involved were Carradine&#x27;s burnout, changes in the writing and shooting that altered the show&#x27;s quality, and changes in the time slot, which led to the audience&#x27;s decline; finally, the main reason was Carradine&#x27;s decision to quit to pursue a career as a film actor and filmmaker. Also, the bad publicity that the 1974 peyote-related incident attracted on him affected the ratings in a way that Radames Pera described as sabotage, and that Carradine himself acknowledged had been detrimental to them.

During &quot;Kung Fu&quot;&#x27;s original run, Carradine made cameo appearances in Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973) (alongside his brother Robert Carradine) and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. He also directed several episodes of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, a short musical called &quot;A Country Mile&quot; (1973), and a film, &quot;You and Me&quot; (also known as &quot;Around&quot;). Carradine&#x27;s annual salary on the show was reportedly $100,000.

===Film stardom===
Immediately after &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, Carradine accepted the role of the racecar driver Frankenstein in &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; (1975), he said, to &quot;kill the image of Caine and launch a movie career.&quot; The role had originally been offered to Peter Fonda, who was not available. The film, directed by Paul Bartel and produced by Roger Corman, became a cult classic for New World Pictures. Carradine got 10% of the profits and made significant money from it. Carradine was tapped to play Duke Leto Atreides in Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s aborted &quot;Dune&quot; adaptation in the late 1970s. Carradine starred in the 1975 TV movie &quot;Long Way Home&quot; and another car chase film for Bartel and New World, &quot;Cannonball!&quot; (1976). Also in 1976, he earned critical praise for his portrayal of folksinger Woody Guthrie in Hal Ashby&#x27;s &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, for which he won a National Board of Review Award for Best Actor and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award. Carradine worked very closely with his friend, singer-songwriter-guitarist Guthrie Thomas, on the film. Thomas assisted Carradine in the guitar style of the period and the songs that had been chosen to be in the film.

Carradine made a third car chase film for Corman, &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;, in 1977. Next came the role of the alcoholic, unemployed trapeze artist Abel Rosenberg in &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1977). Set in post-World War I Berlin and also starring Liv Ullmann, &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot; is one of the only two English-language films by famed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, the second being &quot;The Touch&quot;. Carradine replaced Richard Harris, who was too ill to do it. Bergman said of his leading man, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in God, but Heaven must have sent him.&quot; Carradine said that he and Bergman had plans to collaborate further, but Bergman&#x27;s affection for him waned when he passionately protested a scene that included the butchering of a horse. The altercation caused Carradine to question the fate of Bergman&#x27;s soul while the director declared, &quot;Little Brother, I am an old whore. I have shot two other horses, burned one and strangled a dog.&quot;

Back in Hollywood, Carradine co-starred with Charlton Heston in &quot;Gray Lady Down&quot; (1978) and did another film for Corman, &quot;Deathsport&quot; (1978), an unofficial sequel to &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;. When Bruce Lee died in 1973, he left an unreleased movie script he had developed with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant, &quot;The Silent Flute&quot;. The script became &quot;Circle of Iron&quot; (1978), and in the film, Carradine played the four roles originally intended for Lee. Carradine considered this among his best work. Carradine made &quot;Mr. Horn&quot; (1979) for TV, playing Tom Horn based on a script by William Goldman. After doing a fifth Corman action film, &quot;Fast Charlie... the Moonbeam Rider&quot; (1979), directed by Steve Carver, Carradine played Paul Gauguin for TV in &quot;Gauguin the Savage&quot; (1980).

In &quot;The Long Riders&quot; (1980), Carradine starred with his half-brothers Keith and Robert Carradine as the Younger Brothers. The ensemble cast included three other brother/actor groupings: Stacy and James Keach; Dennis and Randy Quaid, and Christopher and Nicholas Guest. The movie, which was about the Jesse James gang, gave Carradine, who played Cole Younger, one of his most memorable roles. Walter Hill directed. Carradine played a pilot in &quot;Cloud Dancer&quot; (1980) and was the villain in &quot;High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane&quot; (1980). He did a car chase film in Africa, &quot;Safari 3000&quot; (1980).

===&quot;Americana&quot; and decline as star===
Carradine returned to the director&#x27;s chair with &quot;Americana&quot; (1981) (which was actually the completion of the earlier movie Around), which he also starred in, produced and edited. The film took ten years to complete due to difficulty in financing. It featured several of his friends and family members in supporting roles. It won the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the Director&#x27;s Fortnight at Cannes, but failed to achieve critical support or adequate distribution. He also directed the unreleased &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, an epic that starred his daughter, Calista.

Carradine guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Darkroom&quot; and starred in Larry Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; (1982). He made a cameo in &quot;Trick or Treats&quot; (1982) and was the villain in &quot;Lone Wolf McQuade&quot; (1983) with Chuck Norris. Carradine returned to guest-starring on regular TV series like &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Airwolf&quot;, &quot;Fox Mystery Theater&quot; and &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;. He starred in TV movies like &quot;Jealousy&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; (1985), and was still in demand as the star of cheaper action films such as &quot;The Warrior and the Sorceress&quot; (1984) and &quot;On the Line&quot; (1984).

===&quot;North and South&quot;===
Carradine attracted notice in 1985 when he appeared in a major supporting role in &quot;North and South&quot;, a miniseries about the American Civil War, as the evil and abusive Justin LaMotte. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

Carradine reprised his role as Caine in &quot;Kung Fu: The Movie&quot; (1986) for TV, which he also produced. It was the acting debut of Bruce Lee&#x27;s son, Brandon Lee. He starred in the low-budget action film &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; (1986) and reprised his role as LaMotte in &quot;North and South, Book II&quot;, telecast in May 1986.

===Straight-to-video action films===

Carradine continued to be in demand for action films, either aimed at the video market or for TV: &quot;Oceans of Fire&quot; (1986), &quot;Armed Response&quot; (1986) for Fred Olen Ray, &quot;The Misfit Brigade&quot; (1987), and &quot;Six Against the Rock&quot; (1987) as Bernie Coy. Carradine also guest starred on &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Night Heat&quot; and he was in &quot;I Saw What You Did&quot; (1988), &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (1988), &quot;Warlords&quot; (1988) (again for Ray), &quot;Tropical Snow&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Cover Girl and the Cop&quot; (1989). He received some good reviews for &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; (1989), on which he sang on the soundtrack. 

Carradine starred in three films for Roger Corman: &quot;Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II&quot; (1989), directed by Charles B. Griffith; &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; (1989), directed by Carl Franklin; and &quot;Crime Zone&quot; (1990) directed by Luis Llosa; Carradine co-produced the latter. He was also in &quot;&quot; (1989), directed by Anthony Hickox; &quot;Try This One for Size&quot; (1989), &quot;Open Fire&quot; (1989), and &quot;Future Force&quot; (1989), which he helped produce.

In 1989, he starred in the low-budget direct-to-video Swedish action movie &quot;The Mad Bunch&quot; directed by Mats Helge Olsson, making him one of three actors (including Heinz Hopf and Tor Isedal) who have starred in both an Ingmar Bergman movie and an Olsson movie. He followed it with &quot;Night Children&quot; (1989), &quot;Crime of Crimes&quot; (1989) (which he produced), &quot;Animal Protector&quot; (1989), &quot;Dune Warriors&quot; (1990), &quot;Martial Law&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Trace of Lynx&quot; (1990).

Carradine appeared in his first studio film in a long time with &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; (1990) and he guest-starred on television shows including &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;The Young Riders&quot;, and &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theatre&quot;. However he predominantly worked as the star of straight to video action films: &quot;Future Zone&quot; (1990), a sequel to &quot;Future Force&quot;, &quot;Fatal Secret&quot; (1990), &quot;Midnight Fear&quot; (1991), &quot;Project Eliminator&quot; (1991) (which he helped produce), &quot;Deadly Surveillance&quot; (1991), and &quot;Brotherhood of the Gun&quot; (1991).

Carradine had supporting roles in &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991) and appeared in &quot;Capital Punishment&quot; (1991) and &quot;Karate Cop&quot; (1991). Carradine was in &quot;Battle Gear&quot; (1991) and &quot;Evil Toons&quot; (1992) for Ray, and had support parts in &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (1992), &quot;Roadside Prophets&quot; (1992), &quot;Night Rhythms&quot; (1992), &quot;Waxwork II: Lost in Time&quot; (1992), and &quot;Distant Justice&quot; (1992).

In a 2005 interview, Carradine talks about a period in his career in which he worked as much as he could. &quot;Psychotronic Magazine&quot; gave him an award for the &quot;Most Working Actor in the Universe&quot;. Carradine commented that he received it &quot;because I did nineteen movies in eighteen months. And they actually missed a couple!&quot; He further stated, &quot;That whole era of independent movies died. They clotted the market. I didn&#x27;t know how to get out of that, so I did [the second series of Kung Fu]&quot;.

===&quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;===
Carradine played the part of the grandson and namesake of the original Kwai Chang Caine in &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot; (1992), which led to a new TV series that ran from 1993 to 1997, and consisted of 88 episodes. Carradine also worked as a producer and directed an episode. He starred in &quot;Kill Zone&quot; (1993), &quot;Dead Center&quot; (1993) for Steve Carver, &quot;Code... Death: Frontera Sur&quot; (1993), and &quot;Bitter End&quot; (1993). He was featured in a Lipton Tea commercial, which first aired during the broadcast of Super Bowl XXVIII. The advertisement paid tribute to The Three Stooges while satirizing his role in &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. In 1997, Carradine was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The presenters played an April Fool&#x27;s Day prank on him by first unveiling a star bearing the name of his brother, Robert.

When &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot; ended, Carradine went into &quot;Last Stand at Saber River&quot; (1997), an episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, &quot;Lost Treasure of Dos Santos&quot; (1997), &quot;The Rage&quot; (1997), &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1997), &quot;Macon County Jail&quot; (1997), &quot;&quot; (1997), &quot;Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror&quot; (1998), &quot;The New Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1998), &quot;Shepherd&quot; (1998), &quot;The Effects of Magic&quot; (1998), &quot;Kiss of a Stranger&quot; (1998), &quot;Sublet&quot; (1998), &quot;Martian Law&quot; (1998) for Hickox, &quot;Lovers and Liars&quot; (1998), &quot;Light Speed&quot; (1998), and &quot;Knocking on Death&#x27;s Door&quot; (1999). In 1999, he made an appearance as the demon Tempus in the Season 1 finale episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;. He guest starred on shows such as &quot;Acapulco H.E.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;, and &quot;Family Law&quot;. Carradine starred in &quot;Natural Selection&quot; (1999), &quot;Full Blast&quot; (1999), &quot;Zoo&quot; (1999), &quot;The Puzzle in the Air&quot; (1999), &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; (2000) (starring Robert), &quot;Down &#x27;n Dirty&quot;, &quot;Nightfall&quot; (2000), and &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot; (2000).

In 2001, he appeared in the episode &quot;The Serpent&quot; of the syndicated TV series &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; as the sword-wielding bandit &quot;El Serpiente&quot; filmed at Texas Hollywood studios in Almeria, Spain, home of many Spaghetti Westerns. Carradine was increasingly becoming a support actor in films: &quot;Largo Winch: The Heir&quot; (2001), &quot;G.O.D.&quot; (2001), &quot;Warden of Red Rock&quot; (2001), &quot;The Donor&quot; (2001), &quot;Out of the Wilderness&quot; (2001), &quot;The Defectors&quot; (2001), &quot;Wheatfield with Crows&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Outsider&quot; (2002). He guest-starred in &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot;, &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot;, &quot;Titus&quot;, and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. David also made a guest appearance in episode 11 of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; as himself, which gave him an opportunity to work with his brother Robert, who played Lizzie&#x27;s father in the series.

===&quot;Kill Bill&quot;===
Carradine enjoyed a revival of his fame when he was cast in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s sequential &quot;Kill Bill&quot; movies, &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; (2003) and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004). Among those who thought his portrayal of Bill, the assassin extraordinaire, would earn him an Academy Award nomination was Scott Mantz of &quot;The Mediadrome&quot;, who said, &quot;Carradine practically steals every scene he&#x27;s in with confident gusto, and he gives a soulful performance that should all but ensure a spot on next year&#x27;s Oscar ballot.&quot; Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper each had &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 2&quot; on their top ten list for of Academy Awards predictions. Although the films received no notice from the Academy, Carradine did receive a Golden Globe nomination and a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bill. Carradine had a good part in &quot;American Reel&quot; (2003) but the overall quality of his roles did not improve: &quot;Dead &amp; Breakfast&quot; (2004),
&quot;Last Goodbye&quot; (2004), &quot;Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon&quot; (2004), &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (2005), &quot;Miracle at Sage Creek&quot; (2005), &quot;Final Move&quot; (2006), &quot;Saints Row&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Last Sect&quot; (2006). David Carradine took over hosting duties from his brother Keith on &quot;Wild West Tech&quot; on the History Channel, in 2005. The same year, he also played both himself and the ghost of a dead man for an episode of the NBC TV show &quot;Medium&quot;.

By 2006, he had become the spokesperson for Yellowbook, a publisher of independent telephone directories in the United States. He also appeared as Clockwork, the ghost of time, in two episodes of the animated series, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;. He had a cameo in &quot;Epic Movie&quot; (2007) and was in &quot;Treasure Raiders&quot; (2007), &quot;How to Rob a Bank (and 10 Tips to Actually Get Away with It)&quot; (2007), &quot;Fall Down Dead&quot; (2007) (which he helped produce), &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (2007), and &quot;Fuego&quot; (2007). Carradine played Buckingham in a version of &quot;Richard III&quot; (2007) which he helped produce, and was in a studio film when he supported Rob Schneider in &quot;Big Stan&quot; (2007). He did another comedy, &quot;Homo Erectus&quot; (2007), and was in &quot;Blizhniy Boy: The Ultimate Fighter&quot; (2007) and &quot;Hell Ride&quot; (2008). He starred in the 2008 TV movie, &quot;Kung Fu Killer&quot;, in which he played a Chinese martial arts master very similar to his &quot;Kung Fu&quot; series &quot;Caine&quot; persona—his character in this movie named &quot;White Crane&quot;, and mostly referred to or addressed as &quot;Crane&quot;, frequently pronounced in a manner that minimizes the R sound.

===Final years===

Carradine&#x27;s last performances included a role in the music video of the Jonas Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Burnin&#x27; Up&quot; (2008), &quot;Camille&quot; (2008), &quot;Last Hour&quot; (2008), &quot;Break&quot; (2008), &quot;The Golden Boys&quot; (2008), &quot;Kandisha&quot; (2008), &quot;Archie&#x27;s Final Project&quot; (2009), &quot;Absolute Evil - Final Exit&quot; (2009), &quot;Road of No Return&quot; (2009) with Michael Madsen, &quot;&quot; (2009), and &quot;Autumn&quot; (2009).

===Posthumous releases===
Carradine, who once received an award for being the hardest-working actor in Hollywood, still had approximately a dozen films in post-production at the time of his death in 2009. Most of these roles were cameos or small parts in independent, direct-to-DVD productions. Among them are a horror film, &quot;Dark Fields&quot; (2009); an action film, &quot;Bad Cop&quot; (2009); and a Western, &quot;All Hell Broke Loose&quot; (2009); and &quot;Detention&quot; (2010), a thriller. He made one last film for Corman, &quot;Dinocroc vs. Supergator&quot; (2010) directed by Jim Wynorski. Ken Tucker, writing for Entertainment Weekly, said the film was &quot;impeccable&quot; and &quot;goofy fun all the way&quot;. He was also in &quot;Six Days in Paradise&quot; (2010) with Madsen; &quot;Money to Burn&quot; (2010); &quot;Stretch&quot; (2011); &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (2012); and &quot;The Banksters, Madoff with America&quot; (2013). 

Carradine also appeared in a minor role in Yuen Woo-ping&#x27;s Chinese kung fu epic &quot;True Legend&quot;; they had first met while filming &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. Yuen eulogized Carradine on the &quot;True Legend&quot; website, describing him as a &quot;good friend&quot;. Yuen said of Carradine: 

He appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Devil&quot; by Ours, with images originally shot four years before for the unreleased short film &quot;8 For Infinity&quot;, directed by Michael Maxxis. His final released movie was the cult independent film &quot;Night of the Templar&quot; (2013), directed by his friend Paul Sampson, in which Carradine wielded a sword (katana) for the final time on screen. There are several references in the film that coincidentally relate to the circumstances of Carradine&#x27;s death, including auto-erotic asphyxiation.

Carradine co-produced a full-length documentary about luthier Stuart Mossman, which has been identified as the actor&#x27;s last film appearance. &quot;The Legend of Stuart Mossman: A Modern Stradivari&quot;, directed by Barry Brown, premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, in February 2010. It featured David, Keith, and Robert Carradine performing their music on Mossman guitars. Mossman had appeared with Carradine in &quot;Cloud Dancer&quot; (1980), which Brown also directed, and in &quot;The Long Riders&quot;. On the small screen, Carradine appeared in a guest spot on the television series &quot;Mental&quot; that was broadcast just days after his death. On October 3, 2009, &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; premiered on the Biography Channel with an interview of Carradine discussing his belief that his closet was haunted by his wife&#x27;s deceased previous husband. The segment, which was described as &quot;eerie&quot;, was filmed four months before his own death.

==Martial artist==
Carradine knew nothing of the practice of kung fu at the time he was cast in the role of Kwai Chang Caine; instead, he relied on his experience as a dancer for the part. He also had experience in sword fighting, boxing, and street fighting on which to draw. For the first half of the original series, David Chow provided technical assistance with kung fu, followed by Kam Yuen, who became Carradine&#x27;s martial arts instructor. He never considered himself a master of the art, but rather an &quot;evangelist&quot; of kung fu. By 2003, he had acquired enough expertise in martial arts to produce and star in several instructional videos on tai chi and Qigong. In 2005, Carradine visited the Shaolin Monastery in Henan, China, as part of the extra features for the third season of the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; DVDs. During his visit, the abbot, Shi Yǒngxìn, said that he recognized Carradine&#x27;s important contribution to the promotion of the Shaolin Monastery and kung fu culture, to which Carradine replied, &quot;I am happy to serve.&quot;

==Music career==
In addition to his acting career, Carradine was a musician. He sang and played the piano, the guitar, and the flute, among other instruments. In 1970, Carradine played one half of a flower-power beatnik duo in the season 4 &quot;Ironside&quot; episode, &quot;The Quincunx&quot;, performing the songs &quot;I Stepped on a Flower&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Stranger&quot;, and &quot;Sorrow of the Singing Tree&quot;. He recorded an album titled &quot;Grasshopper&quot;, which was released in 1975. His musical talents were often integrated into his screen performances. He performed several of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s songs for the movie, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;. For the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; series, he made flutes out of bamboo that he had planted on the Warner Brothers lot. He later made several flutes for the movie &quot;Circle of Iron&quot;, one of which he later played in &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. Carradine wrote and performed the theme songs for at least two movies that he starred in, &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Sonny Boy&quot;. The first line from the &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; theme, &quot;Paint&quot;, which he wrote while filming &quot;Americana&quot; in 1973, is engraved on his headstone. He wrote and performed several songs for &quot;American Reel&quot; (2003) and wrote the score for &quot;You and Me&quot;. He and his brother, Robert, also performed with a band, the &quot;Cosmic Rescue Team&quot; (also known as &quot;Soul Dogs&quot;). The band performed primarily in small venues and at charity benefits.

==Personal life==
Shortly after being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1960, Carradine proposed to Donna Lee Becht (born September 26, 1937), whom he had met when they were students at Oakland High School; they married on Christmas Day that year. She lived with him off-base when he was stationed at Fort Eustis in Virginia. In April 1962, she gave birth to their daughter Calista. After Carradine&#x27;s discharge, the family lived in New York while Carradine established his acting career, appearing on Broadway in &quot;The Deputy&quot; and &quot;Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;. The marriage dissolved in 1968, whereupon Carradine left New York and headed back to California to continue his television and film careers.

In 1968, Carradine met actress Barbara Hershey while the two of them were working on &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot;. The pair lived together until 1975. They appeared in other films together, including Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;. In 1972, they appeared together in a nude &quot;Playboy&quot; spread, recreating some sex scenes from &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;. That year, Hershey gave birth to their son, Free (who, when aged nine, changed his name to Tom, much to his father&#x27;s chagrin). The couple&#x27;s relationship fell apart around the time of Carradine&#x27;s 1974 burglary arrest, when Carradine began an affair with Season Hubley, who had guest-starred on &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Carradine was engaged to Hubley for a time, but they never married.

In February 1977, Carradine married his second wife Linda (&quot;née&quot; Linda Anne Gilbert) in a civil ceremony in Munich, Germany, after filming &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot;. Gilbert was previously married to Roger McGuinn of The Byrds. Their daughter, Kansas, was born in 1978. Carradine&#x27;s second marriage ended in divorce, as did the two that followed.

He was married to Gail Jensen from 1986 to 1997 and to Marina Anderson from 1998 to 2001.

On December 26, 2004, Carradine married his fifth wife, widow Annie Bierman (&quot;née&quot; Anne Kirstie Fraser; born December 21, 1960) at the seaside Malibu home of his friend Michael Madsen. Vicki Roberts, his attorney and a longtime friend of his wife&#x27;s, performed the ceremony. With this marriage he acquired three stepdaughters, Amanda Eckelberry (born 1989), Madeleine Rose (born 1995), and Olivia Juliette (born 1998) as well as a stepson, actor Max Richard Carradine (born 1998). In one of his final interviews, Carradine stated that at 71, he was still &quot;in excellent shape&quot;, attributing it to a good diet and having a youthful circle of friends. &quot;Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than I am. My wife Annie is 24 years younger than I am. My daughter asks why I don&#x27;t hang with women my age and I say, &#x27;Most of the women my age are a lot older than me!

===Arrests and prosecutions===
In the late 1950s, while living in San Francisco, Carradine was arrested for assaulting a police officer. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disturbing the peace. While in the Army, he faced court-martial on more than one occasion for shoplifting. After he became an established actor and had changed his name to David, he was arrested in 1967 for possession of marijuana.

In 1974, at the height of his popularity in &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, Carradine was arrested again, this time for attempted burglary and malicious mischief. While under the influence of peyote, Carradine began wandering nude around his Laurel Canyon neighborhood. He broke into a neighbor&#x27;s home, smashing a window and cutting his arm, and accosted two young women, allegedly assaulting one while asking her if she was a witch. Carradine pleaded no contest to the mischief charge and was given probation. He was never charged with assault, but the young woman sued him for $1.1 million and was awarded $20,000.

In 1980, while in South Africa filming &quot;Safari 3000&quot; (also known as &quot;Rally&quot;), which co-starred Stockard Channing, Carradine was arrested for possession of marijuana. He was convicted and given a suspended sentence. He claimed that he had been framed by the apartheid government, as he had been seen dancing with Tina Turner.

During the 1980s, Carradine was arrested at least twice for driving under the influence of alcohol, once in 1984 and again in 1989. In the second case, Carradine pleaded no contest. Of this incident, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported: &quot;Legal experts say Carradine was handed a harsher-than-average sentence, even for a second-time offender: three years&#x27; summary probation, 48 hours in jail, 100 hours of community service, 30 days&#x27; work picking up trash for the California Department of Transportation, attendance at a drunk driving awareness meeting and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.&quot;

In 1994, in Toronto, filming &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;, Carradine was arrested for kicking in a door at the SkyDome while attending a Rolling Stones concert. He later claimed that he was trying to avoid being swarmed by fans.

==Death==


Carradine arrived in Bangkok, Thailand, on May 31, 2009, to shoot the film &quot;Stretch&quot;. He was last seen alive on June 3, but he could not be contacted after he failed to appear for a meal with the film crew.

On June 4, Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel. He was 72 years old. Lieutenant Teerapop Luanseng and Lieutenant Colonel Pirom Jantrapirom said that Carradine was found naked and had hanged himself in the room&#x27;s closet with a curtain cord. Police said he had been dead for at least 12 hours and found no sign of struggle. Thai police suggested the death might have been from accidental suffocation, since there was no suicide note and he was found with a rope tied to both his neck and his genitals. Pornthip Rojanasunand, director of Thailand&#x27;s Central Institute of Forensic Science, said it may have been a case of auto-erotic asphyxiation. Thai authorities conducted the first autopsy on Carradine shortly after his death, and stated on June 8 that it would take a month to determine how he died, although a Thai police colonel told Reuters that the likely cause was asphyxiation. On July 1, 2009, Michael Baden, the medical examiner hired by Carradine&#x27;s family to conduct his own autopsy on Carradine, stated that the actor died from asphyxiation, and that the way Carradine&#x27;s body was bound allowed him to rule out suicide.

<text>The Gothenburg opera house () is an opera house at Lilla Bommen in Gothenburg, Sweden. The Artistic Director for opera is Henning Ruhe since 2019, while Katrín Hall leads the ballet and dance company.

== History ==
The Gothenburg opera house is relatively new: construction started in September 1989 after significant local commitment in the late 1980s (with as many as 6,000 contributors to the new house) and it was completed with great speed. Ground breaking took place in June 1991, and the building was inaugurated in October 1994.

It hosted Melodifestivalen 2000, the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest.

== Building and capacity ==
The result was an auditorium built in the classical style. With its stalls and balconies, it has 1,276 seats. The orchestra pit has room for about 100 musicians. The House is shared by opera, ballet, musicals and operettas so the architects had to meet a number of challenges.

It is a large house – 160 metres long and 85 metres wide at its widest – and the building is 32 metres high. The floor area is 28,700 square metres. The main stage is 500 square metres, while the stage opening is 20 metres (66 ft) high and 9 metres (30 ft) wide. There are four movable platforms that each can carry a weight of 15 tons. The stage can be lit by 1000 spotlights with 250 automatic color scrollers and 900 dimmer lights.

== Architecture ==

The architect, Jan Izikowitz, shares his vision of the house:

The building should be possessed by an airiness that sends your mind soaring across the meandering landscape like wings of seagulls. Its shape should be inspired by its location, from the magnificent but elusive landscape with its light and open spaces, to the harbor&#x27;s more tangible technical constructions; the bridges gracefully suspended across the water, the transparent framework of the harbor cranes, the strength, softness and elegance of the ships&#x27; hulls, the wings of seagulls and the flawless aerodynamic shape of sails.

He reflects on the operatic aspect of the design: &quot;The world of opera should also be visible in the architecture: the rear stage wall as a large set piece, the colonnade as a series of symbolic gates and stage openings, the fly towers as gigantic lighting towers, the shape and color of the auditorium as an allusion to old traditions.&quot;

The overall size of the building is a reflection of the company&#x27;s growth and its spread throughout the city. Therefore, the building attempts to encompass all the activities that were earlier spread out at six different locations are now housed in one building. Another reason is that the Gothenburg Opera should be able to offer as wide a selection of productions as possible, with the possibility of changing performance and art form from one night to another. There can be five assembled stage sets stored in the house at the same time, in five different areas the same size as the main stage. With the help of advanced modern technology, whole stage sets can be moved around, exchanged and assembled for the next performance.

<text>Malmö Opera () is an opera house in Malmö, Sweden. An opera company of the same name presents seasons of opera in this house.

Built 1933-1944 by architect Sigurd Lewerentz and, until 1992, known as the Malmö City Theatre accommodating several different organizations, the Opera House is one of the largest auditoriums in Scandinavia with 1,511 seats, created in the form of an enclosed amphitheatre in order to allow for the greatest viewing possibility. It is used for opera, operetta, and musical performances.

==The opera building and its background as Malmö City Theater==
Malmö&#x27;s first major theater, Malmö Teater, was founded in 1808, but ceased to be used in 1938. In 1931, The Malmö City Theater Association was formed to construct a modern theater building and a city theater including spoken theater, opera, operetta and the like, ballet, pantomime and symphonic concerts. A powerful chairman and dominant municipal politician named Emil Olsson carried out the theater construction during World War II. The new theater building was designed by architects Sigurd Lewerentz, David Helldén and Erik Lallerstedt. Sigurd Lewerentz was commissioned in the 1920s to design a new theater in Malmö and proposed a building in a distinctly classical style.

However, Lewerentz&#x27;s original proposal had to give way to new architectural trends in Sweden and the building was designed in the spirit of functionalism. The building was constructed from 1933 to 1944 and was inaugurated on September 23, 1944. The building was considered the most modern theater in Northern Europe. The theater building combines a functionalist division into several building volumes for different purposes with a monumental design language with classical features, in particular the grand entrance facade&#x27;s marble-clad columns and large window areas. The main foyer is considered particularly beautiful, decorated with works of art by Carl Milles and Isaac Grünewald, among others.

===Several stages===
The building includes the &quot;Main stage&quot;, &quot;Intiman&quot; (&quot;The Intimate&quot;) (now part of the dramatic ensemble called &quot;Malmö City Theatre&quot;) and recently also &quot;Verkstan&quot; (&quot;The Workshop&quot;), the home stage for the opera&#x27;s children and youth activities, &quot;Operaverkstan&quot;. It also plans to introduce classic operas for its audience, and sometimes children participate in the productions. Adjacent is the theater restaurant&#x27;s wing. From 1944 to the early 1990s, extensive and varied theatrical activities took place there (and on other detached stages, such as &quot;Nya Teatern&quot;; now the private theater &quot;Nöjesteatern&quot;) within the framework of the then &quot;Malmö City Theatre&quot;.

Malmö got its theater cheaply. 6 million SEK in 1944. &quot;Malmö City Theater&quot;, built in 1944, is a monument to the dream of the popular theater. Even after 80 years, it is still perceived as magnificent, modern and inviting. Since December 13, 1994, the theater is a listed building.

The main stage has one of the largest auditoriums in the Nordic countries. The auditorium can accommodate a maximum of 1 511 spectators, of which ten are wheelchair spaces and ten are companion spaces. The auditorium can be reduced to four different sizes by means of retractable walls. The stage itself is one of the largest in Europe. The proscenium can be raised and lowered and can be used either as an orchestra pit - capable of accommodating around 60 musicians - as part of the auditorium or as a direct continuation of the main stage. The main stage is 25 meters deep and 25 meters high. The stage area is 600 square meters. The height of the stage opening is seven meters and the width can be varied between 15 meters and 21 meters. Influenced by German director Max Reinhardt, a large (20 meters in diameter) revolving stage was constructed.

===Artistic decoration===

The piazza outside the building is adorned with Nils Sjögren&#x27;s &quot;Tragos&quot;. In the lower foyer is Bror Marklund&#x27;s imposing bronze &quot;Thalia&quot;. The upper foyer contains a number of sculptures, including Carl Eldh&#x27;s &quot;Young Girl&quot; (marble) and a fountain figure (plaster), Anders Jönsson&#x27;s &quot;Aphrodite&quot; (bronze), Clarence Blum&#x27;s &quot;The Dance Goes&quot; (bronze), Gunnar Nylund&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (chamotte), Isaac Grünewald&#x27;s &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, Wäinö Aaltonen&#x27;s &quot;Georg Schnéevoigt&quot; (bronze), Anders Olsson&#x27;s &quot;Oscar Winge&quot; (bronze) and Carl Milles&#x27; &quot;Fanny and Selma&quot; (marble). The upper foyer is also decorated by two large oil paintings by Martin Emond with motifs taken from plays by Shakespeare.

===Activities===

Many well-known performing artists and directors have worked there over the years, such as Ingmar Bergman and his famous actors (Max von Sydow, Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, Ingrid Thulin, Jarl Kulle, Jan Malmsjö, Lars Passgård and others), Birgit Nilsson, Sixten Ehrling, Bo Widerberg, Ernst-Hugo Järegård, Nils Poppe, Tommy Körberg, Bengt Krantz, Rickard Söderberg, Marianne Mörck, Lars Humble, Göran Stangertz, Nina Gunke, Birgitta Smiding, Karin Mang-Habashi, Philip Zandén, Lars Rudolfsson, Staffan Valdemar Holm, Peter Oskarson, Peter Stein, a host of operetta and musical artists such as Ing-Britt Stiber, Lars Ekman, Maj Lindström, Tommy Juth, Nina Pressing (including guests such as Charlotte Perelli, Sanna Nielsen, Peter Jöback, Sven-Bertil Taube, Nanne Grönvall, Petra Nielsen, Linda Olsson, Andreas Weise), dancers and opera singers from all over the world.

Until the opening of Malmö Concert Hall in 1985, the main stage also served as a concert hall once a week for the Malmö Symphony Orchestra with classical concerts, in addition to the orchestra also serving as the city theater&#x27;s theater orchestra for opera, operetta, musical and ballet. On the main stage, Swedish Television has also organized events such as the 1988, 1995, 1998 and 2001 Eurovision Song Contest.

===Malmö Ballet 1944-1995===
Already from the theater&#x27;s opening in 1944, there was its own ballet company, &quot;Malmöbaletten&quot;, as part of the business with Carl-Gustaf Kruuse af Verchou as its first director and ballet master, including his wife Inga Berggren as a soloist mixed with trained dancers and former entertainment dancers from &quot;Hippodromen&quot;. An internal ballet school was therefore started to raise the quality and in 1961 it was supplemented with &quot;Malmö City Theatre&#x27;s Ballet School&quot; for children and young aspiring dancers, who often also came to participate in the theater&#x27;s performances.

Gradually, the ballet took its place as a quality ballet ensemble, performing annually well-known classical ballets as well as original works (including &quot;Skymningslekar&quot;, 1954, created by Kruuse and Ingmar Bergman, with music by Ingvar Wieslander; &quot;Simson och Delila&quot;, 1964, by Rune Lindström and Erland von Koch; &quot;Elvira Madigan&quot;, 1977, by Conny Borg and Michael Smith; and &quot;Johannesnatten&quot;, 1981, by Gunnar de Frumerie, with new choreography by Elsa-Marianne von Rosen) and works in the direction of modern dance. In addition, dancers often participated in other theater productions, opera, operetta, musicals and exceptionally some spoken theater productions. In the major restructuring of the theater, the ballet was closed down and replaced by the independent &quot;Skånes dansteater&quot; with only modern dance in 1995.

Directors (and often choreographers and dancers) of the Malmö Ballet were Carl-Gustaf Kruuse af Verchou (1944-1962), Holger Reenberg (1962-1967), Teddy Rhodin (1967-1970), Stella Claire (acting 1970-1971), Conny Borg (1971-1980), Elsa-Marianne von Rosen (1980-1987) and Jonas Kåge (1987-1995).

==The restructuring==

In the early 1990s, a major restructuring of operations began, when the organization Malmö City Theatre was dissolved and replaced by a group with separate companies for speech theater (Malmö Dramatic Theater, since 2008 again under the new name Malmö City Theatre), opera and musical drama (Malmö Opera and Music Theater, now Malmö Opera), modern dance (&quot;Skånes Dansteater&quot;; replaced the former ballet activities) and Malmö Symphony Orchestra MSO in Malmö Concert Hall (replaced for the scenic activities by the newly formed Malmö Opera Orchestra), and later these became independent companies with the City of Malmö and Region Skåne (Scania Region) as owners. In 1990, the economic association was transformed into &quot;Aktiebolaget&quot; Malmö City Theatre, which in 1993 became Malmö Musik och Teater AB, which from 2002 was renamed Malmö Opera och Musikteater AB and later just Malmö Opera.

==Current Malmö Opera activities==
Malmö Opera performs opera and musicals, both newly written Swedish works and classic operas. Theme concerts, gala evenings and guest performances are also organized. All opera is performed in its original language with a few exceptions. The goals of Malmö Opera are professional directors, set designers, singers, librettists and conductors in teamwork, which gives the musical drama of our time the opportunity to grow. A center for tomorrow&#x27;s musical theater. The first director was Lars Rudolfsson, who started the activities with a production of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

The Opera has also distinguished itself with a number of new Swedish or foreign operas and modernized interpretations of older or lesser-known works, (for example, Peter Oskarson&#x27;s production of Verdi&#x27;s Rigoletto (1994) with Loa Falkman and Dilber Yunus received great attention) in addition to some crowd-pleasing musicals such as m &quot;Dåliga Mänskor&quot; (&quot;Bad People&quot;), Jesus Christ Superstar, Les Misérables, Singin&#x27; in the Rain, in addition to earlier successes such as Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s The Merry Widow (1954), The Long Ships (1978), La Cage aux Folles (1985) and a large number of operettas (several with Nils Poppe), as Malmö was long known as the &quot;city of operettas&quot;. In 2006-2011, composer Jonas Forssell was attached to the Opera as &quot;house composer&quot; with three commissioned operas, &quot;Träskoprinsessan&quot; (2006), &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; (2007) and &quot;Hemligheter&quot; (2011) in which the role of Swedenborg was specially written for baritone Bengt Krantz. In addition to the 2010s, the family opera The Snow Queen after Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale was also commissioned. Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale by composer Benjamin Staern and librettist Anelia Kadieva Jonsson, which was a great success with audiences in 2016 and 2018.

===Malmö Opera Orchestra===

The Malmö Opera Orchestra was founded in 1991. Today the orchestra consists of about 60 musicians. The orchestra plays everything from chamber music, opera for children, concerts, musicals to major operas. The orchestra has made several recordings. In June 2016, a new extension was inaugurated with a large orchestra hall, rehearsal rooms, etc. for the orchestra&#x27;s activities and also music recordings.

===Malmö Opera Choir===
Malmö Opera has its own opera choir consisting of 36 people. The choir was led by choirmaster Sofia Söderberg Eberhard and from 2010 by Elisabeth Boström until 2019, then by Elena Mitrevska. The tasks are very varied and include opera, musicals and concerts of various kinds. Members of both the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s choirs often perform soloist roles in the theater&#x27;s productions.

===The Opera Workshop===

Since 2002, Malmö Opera has been working to introduce children and young people to opera in a new way, when it started a special, award-winning production of musical drama for children and young people. The Opera Workshop was started as a project after a donation from &quot;Sparbanksstiftelsen Skåne&quot; and became permanent four years later with The Workshop as its own home stage.

Newly written opera drama, experimental opera and loving reinterpretations of classics are performed there with children both on stage and in the audience. Together, they have created an artistic workshop with words, sounds, images, song and rhythm, where children and young people, their teachers and other adults discover together all the possibilities of music. The Opera Workshop collaborates extensively with independent theater groups, schools, cultural schools and other institutions and produces several performances each year. Interactivity plays a central role, and many of its productions feature children and young people alongside professional artists. Its stated aim is to strengthen children&#x27;s and young people&#x27;s joy of life and faith in the future, and to offer them new experiences to take with them in life.

Director and librettist Maria Sundqvist has been the artistic director of Operaverkstan since its inception. Under her leadership, Operaverkstan has become a leading producer of performing arts for children and young people. This has been rewarded with positive feedback from young people, glowing reviews and several major awards, such as Region Skåne&#x27;s Special Cultural Award 2010.

==Artistic directors==
Artistic directors of Malmö Opera in the early years included Philip Zandén and Lars Rudolfsson. In December 2009, Bengt Hall took over as Artistic Director after Lars Tibell and Göran K Johansson left. In the summer of 2017, Danish composer, music educator and conductor Michael Bojesen took over the directorship, later stepping down on 19 April 2022. As of November 2023, Christina Hörnell holds this position.

==Renovation in 1973 and 2004==

When it opened in 1944, Malmö City Theatre was at the cutting edge of modern technology. After only a short while, it was suddenly outdated. As early as 1973, three new control rooms were built in the main theater, sacrificing 63 seats on the parquet. New lighting systems were installed for both the &quot;Intiman&quot; and the Main Stage. Larger workshops were also required, plus a decoration warehouse in the theater building.

Improving the acoustics of the Main Stage was a very complicated process as the auditorium could be converted into four different sizes. Things became less crowded when, in 1973, the financial administration could be housed in offices nearby. At that time, the old Åberg School was also taken over, which after renovation is called the Yellow Pavilion and houses rehearsal rooms, set design rooms, costume studios, archives, etc.

All the while, the renovation program was replenished. Finally, the theater was closed for eight months in 1986-1987 when it played in various temporary premises, including a hot air tent. When the theatre reopened in February 1987, the chairman of the board, Curt Åke Olsson, was able to note that both &quot;Storan&quot; and &quot;Intiman&quot; had received new armchairs, that the revolving stage had been modernized, new ventilation had been installed and the orchestra pit had been expanded. All this at a cost of around SEK 20 million.

Malmö Opera was renovated again in 2004, when the performances were moved to &quot;Båghallarna&quot; in Västra hamnen (now the home stage of &quot;Skånes Dansteater&quot;). The theater was reopened again in February 2006.

==Friendship and awards==
An independent association of friends of the opera, &quot;Malmö Operas Vänner&quot;, is linked to the opera&#x27;s activities.

The Friends of Malmö Opera was formed as a non-profit organization in 2000 with the aim of safeguarding the interests of the audience, supporting Malmö Opera&#x27;s activities and promoting its development. The aim of the Friends is to help preserve and strengthen Malmö Opera&#x27;s position in Malmö and the surrounding region. The association aims to promote interest in qualified musical drama through cultural activities.

From the financial surplus of the association&#x27;s activities, scholarships and supporting grants are awarded annually.

<text>The NorrlandsOperan (literal translation, &quot;The Norrland&#x27;s Opera&quot;; NOP), is a Swedish opera company in Umeå, located in Norrland, Sweden. The ownership of NOP is divided between the Umeå Municipality (40%) and the Västerbotten County Council (60%).

NOP was established in 1974 as a regional opera ensemble. The NOP&#x27;s first artistic director was Arnold Östman, from 1974 to 1979. NOP now has its own symphony orchestra and facilities for opera, dance, music and art as well as workshops and studios. 
==History==
Norrlandsoperan was founded in 1974 as a direct result of Swedish cultural reform the same year. The musical theater group &quot;Sångens makt&quot; constituted the core of the newly formed opera ensemble. The ensemble initially had to use temporary premises but soon found a more permanent home at &quot;Umeå Folkets hus&quot; (then housed in a building at the intersection Järnvägsallén/Östra kyrkogatan). Norrlandsoperan&#x27;s first director was Arnold Östman, who also was the artistic director of the opera in the years 1974–1979.

In 1984, Norrlandsoperan moved to the old fire station in Umeå, which was built in 1937 in a functionalist style and designed by Wejke &amp; Ödeen. The fire station underwent extensive rebuilding and expansion, designed by Olle Qvarnström.

In 2002, the newly built theater and concert hall, which is incorporated with the old opera house, was inaugurated. The new building houses a hall with 480 seats, a large stage with side stages and orchestra pit, and a concert hall with 500 seats.

Every year in May, since 2006, Norrlandsoperan has arranged the annual &quot;MADE festival&quot; on its premises, and outdoors on Operaplan.

Past NOP artistic directors have included Magnus Aspegren. The current managing director and artistic director of NOP is Kjell Englund, since August 2009. Past chief conductors have included Roy Goodman (1995–2001), Kristjan Järvi (2000–2004), Andrea Quinn (2005–2009), and Rumon Gamba (2009–2015). In April 2016, the company announced the appointment of Elim Chan as its next chief conductor, effective in 2017, with an initial contract of 3 years. In April 2018, Chan announced her intention to stand down as chief conductor of NorrlandsOperan after one season as its chief conductor.

Notable recent productions and collaborations include:
* &quot;Demons of the Opera&quot; (2005, with local hard rock groups)
* &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (2006, Cape Town Opera)
* &quot;Blog Opera&quot; (2007, a collaboration with local school children of different ages)

NOP also assists with other arts organisations, such as the MADE performing arts festival and the Umeå Jazz Festival.

During the opening week of the European City of Culture festival in Umeå in January 2014, Gamba conducted the NorrlandsOperan orchestra in the Konsertsalen in a complete Beethoven symphony cycle, where each of the nine symphonies was prefaced by the premiere of a new work by a contemporary composer. The concerts were all broadcast on Swedish radio.

Later in 2014 the company&#x27;s outdoor production of &quot;Elektra&quot; by Carlus Padrissa and La Fura dels Baus, staged at a large business park in Umeå, Umestan Företagspark was filmed and issued on DVD.

Other recordings include Rosenberg&#x27;s four-act opera of 1943 &quot;Lycksalighetens ö&quot; (taken from live performances in March 2002) on Musica Sveciae, songs by Daniel Schnyder, both conducted by Kristjan Järvi with the Symphony Orchestra of Norrlands Opera, a CD devoted to the music of Hjalmar Borgstrøm, and a collaboration with The Tiger Lillies.

In September 2023, the company announced the appointment of Eduardo Strausser as its next principal conductor and music director, effective in the autumn of 2024, with an initial contract of three seasons.

==Performance facilities==
There are four venues, with corresponding seating capacity: 
* Teatern (Theatre): 470 seats
* Konsertsalen (Concert Hall): 569 seats
* Black Box: up to 260 seats
* B-salen (B-Hall): 64 seats (primarily for children&#x27;s shows)
The building also houses the &quot;Vita kuben&quot; (White Cube), an exhibition space for contemporary art. In 1984, NOP took over the space of the former fire station in Umeå, which was originally built in 1937. After major renovations, the new venue opened in 2002, with a newly built theater and concert hall, combined with the old opera house. An assembly hall was subsequently constructed at the venue.

During a concert with the band Mando Diao on 27 January 2007, parts of the floor collapsed and about 50 people fell about 2.5 meters to the underlying basement floor. 29 people were taken to hospital for treatment of varying degrees. In 2009 the former opera director was convicted in the District Court (Tingsrätt) for gross negligence, but was acquitted the following year by the Court of Appeals (Hovrätt). The opera&#x27;s technical director who also was charged was acquitted in court.

==Chief conductors==
* Roy Goodman (1995–2001)
* Kristjan Järvi (2000–2004)
* Andrea Quinn (2005–2009)
* Rumon Gamba (2009–2015)
* Elim Chan (2017–2018)
* Eduardo Strausser (2024–present)

==Principal guest conductor==
* Ville Matvejeff (2022-present)

<text>Piers McDonald, OC (born August 4, 1955) is a Yukon politician and businessman. 
Born in Kingston, Ontario, McDonald, originally a miner by profession, is a long-time MLA, Cabinet minister, and the fifth premier of Yukon. He was leader of the Yukon New Democratic Party from 1995 to 2000.

Post-politics, McDonald became a businessman and community developer. He is a founding member, and currently chair, of Northern Vision Development, which has focused on residential and property revitalization, commercial real estate, and hospitality services in Yukon. He was also the chancellor of Yukon University from 2016 to 2020.

==Political career==

===25th Legislative Assembly===

McDonald was elected in the rural riding of Mayo as part of the New Democrat caucus in the 1982 election. Taking more than half the vote, he defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Swede Hanson. McDonald had been an underground miner, labour leader, and vice-president of the Yukon Federation of Labour before his entry into territorial politics.

The New Democrats, under the leadership of Tony Penikett, formed the Official Opposition in the 25th Legislative Assembly. McDonald acted as critic for Rural Development, Labour, Occupational Health and Safety, and Workers&#x27; Compensation.

===26th Legislative Assembly===

In the 1985 election, Tony Penikett led the New Democrats to a narrow minority government. McDonald was sworn in as a member of the Yukon Executive Council as Minister of Education, Minister of Community and Transportation Services, and Minister of the Yukon Housing Corporation. During that time, McDonald oversaw a significant agenda for his portfolios, ushering in the creation of the Yukon College and the establishment of the Yukon Arts Centre and the Whitehorse Public Library.

Other initiatives of his included: the Native Teacher Education Program; the opening and paving of the South Klondike Highway, which provided tidewater access for Yukon mines; the transfer of private-sector municipal airports and the Alaska Highway to the Yukon Government; and the establishment of the first home ownership programs and homesteader policies in the territory.

===27th Legislative Assembly===

McDonald was re-elected in Mayo in the 1989 election, which saw the New Democrats attain majority status in the legislative assembly. He was once again sworn into Cabinet, this time as Government House Leader, Minister of Education, Minister of Government Services, Minister of Economic Development, Mines and Small Business, Minister of the Public Service Commission, and Minister of the Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board.

During the 27th Legislative Assembly, McDonald oversaw the creation of the Yukon&#x27;s first &quot;Education Act&quot;, as well as a new &quot;Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Act&quot;. He oversaw the signing of an oil and gas accord with the Government of the Northwest Territories and an economic development agreement with the Government of Canada. Within the public school system, he also established policies on busing, computers, special needs education, and experiential learning. Yukon&#x27;s only French First Language school, École Emilie Tremblay, was opened under his mandate.

===28th Legislative Assembly===

In the 1992 election, McDonald ran for election in the newly created Whitehorse riding of McIntyre-Takhini. His riding of Mayo had been amalgamated with the neighbouring riding of Tatchun. He was elected to McIntyre-Takhini that election, but the Penikett government was narrowly defeated by a minority Yukon Party government led by John Ostashek and propped up by three independent MLAs. Penikett subsequently resigned as leader of the Yukon New Democratic Party and McDonald succeeded him as leader. He assumed the critic portfolios of Finance and Economic Development and served as Leader of the Official Opposition.

===29th Legislative Assembly===

McDonald defeated the government of John Ostashek in the election of September 30, 1996, his government elected with a large level of support in rural Yukon. McDonald&#x27;s party captured 11/17 seats, then the largest majority in Yukon history, and McDonald was once again re-elected in McIntyre-Takhini. He became Premier of the Yukon, then referred to as ‘Government Leader’, and assumed the responsibilities of Minister of Finance and Minister of the Executive Council.

During his premiership, McDonald&#x27;s government oversaw significant restructuring of the Yukon&#x27;s governance. The Umbrella Final Agreement, jointly established through the mandates of Penikett and Ostashek, began to usher in final land claims negotiations for many Yukon First Nations. With the federal government, a devolution accord on the Transfer of Lands and Resource Management to the Yukon was negotiated (ultimately implemented in 2003). McDonald also emphasized intergovernmental and circumpolar relations, established new territorial parks and community schools, and created new government strategies for restorative justice, protected areas, trade and investment, forestry, and energy.

While his government left a $60 million budget surplus and earned a good reputation for promoting social programs and protecting the environment, the Yukon had suffered from a decline in the territory&#x27;s economy due to a fall in world metal prices and the closure of several mines. This became a major campaign issue in the 2000 general election, along with a resulting mass exodus of nearly one-in-ten people from the Yukon.

Ultimately, these economic hardships fueled the rise of the Pat Duncan Liberals and in the 2000 general election, McDonald&#x27;s NDP government was defeated and McDonald himself lost his own seat of McIntyre-Takhini. NDP support had largely held in rural Yukon, but it was the Liberals&#x27; sweep of the territory&#x27;s Whitehorse ridings that ensured the NDP&#x27;s defeat. McDonald resigned as party leader on April 27, 2000.

==Post political activities==

Since leaving territorial politics, McDonald has developed a career as a businessman and management consultant. He became one of the founding members of Northern Vision Development in 2004 and served as its chief executive officer until 2009. Northern Vision Development is one of the Yukon&#x27;s most extensive commercial and real estate investors and has focused on project management, property revitalization, commercial real estate, and hospitality services in the Yukon. McDonald continues to serve as chair of its board of directors. He was named the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s Businessperson of the Year in 2007.

Shortly after his exit from politics, McDonald was appointed the volunteer president of the 2007 Canada Winter Games Host Society for the upcoming Whitehorse event – the first held north of the 60th parallel. McDonald focused on using the Games to promote a vision of pan-northernism and collaboration and he successfully oversaw the modernization of much of Whitehorse&#x27;s sports infrastructure. McDonald continues to serve on the Canada Games Council as its vice-president. He was named the Yukon Commissioner&#x27;s Volunteer of the Year in 2007 in recognition for his volunteerism and leadership of the Canada Winter Games.

In September 2008, McDonald was appointed to the Board of Directors of Northwestel, the communications company providing service to the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. He also served as chair of the Yukon Energy Corporation&#x27;s board of directors and governance from 2009 to 2014.

Following the tenth anniversary of the creation of Nunavut, McDonald led a review of the Government of Nunavut. The ‘’Government of Nunavut Report Card’’ compiled and analysed the opinions of 2,100 Nunavummiut and produced 93 recommendations on how the Government of Nunavut could improve its services and operations. Focus included land claims, decentralization of government, housing, education, and economic development.

In September 2016, McDonald was appointed as chancellor of Yukon University. He was succeeded by Jemena James Allen, on October 6, 2020.

==Honours==

In 2008, in recognition for McDonald’s volunteerism and pan-northern focus in leading the 2007 Canada Winter Games, as well as his ongoing role in Northern economic development and a lifetime of service to the Yukon, McDonald was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. He is one of only four Yukoners to be appointed Officer of the Order.

In June 2011, Queen&#x27;s University presented McDonald with an honorary Doctorate of Laws, in recognition of McDonald&#x27;s work in education, aboriginal land claims and devolution during his political career in Yukon. He is also credited for spearheading construction of Yukon College&#x27;s Whitehorse campus, the Yukon Arts Centre, the South Klondike Highway, and schools in Dawson City, Old Crow and Watson Lake.

<doc id="551655" wikidata="Q819170" url="?curid=551655" title="Saint Michael, Barbados">
<text>The parish of St. Michael is one of eleven parishes of Barbados. It has a land area of and is found at the southwest portion of the island. Saint Michael has survived by name as one of the original six parishes created in 1629 by Governor Sir William Tufton.

The parish is home to Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados. Bridgetown is the centre of commercial activity in Barbados, as well as a central hub for the public transport network. Other major infrastructure in St. Michael is the international seaport of Barbados—the Deep Water Harbour. Therein, a number of cruise ships arrive and depart including various lines such as Royal Caribbean and Cunard. The harbour features several sugar towers for loading locally produced sugar into transport ships, and a tower for loading flour for transport.
 The Needham&#x27;s Point Lighthouse and Charles Fort are both located in Needham&#x27;s Point, Saint Michael, behind the Hilton Barbados Resort.

Under Barbados&#x27;s historical vestry system, the main parish church (St Michael&#x27;s Cathedral) is sited in St Michael&#x27;s Row in Bridgetown. The cathedral replaced the former parish church that was located at the site of St Mary&#x27;s Church. St Michael&#x27;s Cathedral was elevated to cathedral status under Bishop Coleridge, who arrived in Barbados in 1825 to head the newly created Diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands.

<text>Naim Süleymanoğlu (; 23 January 1967 – 18 November 2017) was a Turkish Olympic weightlifter. He was a seven-time World Weightlifting champion and a three-time Olympic gold medalist who set 46 world records. At 147 cm in height, Süleymanoğlu&#x27;s short stature and great strength led to him being nicknamed &quot;Pocket Hercules&quot;. He is widely considered as one of the greatest Olympic weightlifters of all time, with many calling him the best pound-for-pound weightlifter in the history of weightlifting.

At the 1988 Summer Olympics, Süleymanoğlu set multiple world records in the featherweight division in the snatch, clean and jerk, and total. Following the 1988 Summer Olympics, he made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Süleymanoğlu went on to win Olympic gold in 1992 and 1996. He was awarded the Olympic Order in 2001. In 2000 and 2004, he was elected as a member of the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame.

==Early life In Bulgaria, early career, and defection to Turkey==

Süleymanoğlu was born in Ptichar, Kardzhali Province, Bulgaria. His father was a miner who stood only five feet tall, while his mother was four-foot-seven. He set a world weightlifting record during his teens and would have been an overwhelming favorite to win gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics had Bulgaria not joined in a boycott by the Eastern Block.

In the 1980s, Bulgaria&#x27;s government implemented a program called the Revival Process which required ethnic minorities to adopt Slavic names and barred their languages. As a result, Süleymanoğlu was forced to change his name to Naum Shalamanov (Bulgarian: Наум Шаламанов) in 1985. He decided to leave Bulgaria after these experiences and he conducted encrypted correspondence with Turkish Squad during the period.

While on a trip to the World Cup Final in Melbourne in 1986, Süleymanoğlu escaped his handlers, and after several days in hiding, he defected at the Turkish Embassy in Canberra. When Embassy officials reported the situation to Turgut Özal, The Prime Minister ordered him to be brought at once. He landed in London first, where he was transferred into a private jet to fly into Istanbul and Ankara eventually. After making his way to Istanbul, he changed his name back to Süleymanoğlu.

In 2012, Süleymanoğlu said, &quot;Against all the odds, I&#x27;ve never been nostalgic. After being treated with such attitude, you wouldn&#x27;t regret it. The Bulgarians changed the names of 2 million people by force. It was a very difficult period. People who witnessed the events would know. I wouldn&#x27;t change any of the decisions I took that day in my life. Even if I could set back the clock, I would still escape Bulgaria. Because as the Turkish people, we were too hard-pressed in Bulgaria.&quot;

==Olympic competition==
In order for Süleymanoğlu to compete at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the Bulgarian government had to agree to release his eligibility to Turkey. The Turks paid Bulgaria $1.25 million for his release.

At the Olympics, Süleymanoğlu competed in the featherweight division. His main competition was his old teammate from the Bulgarian team, Stefan Topurov. He came out for the snatch portion of the competition after all other athletes had finished and made three consecutive lifts, setting world records in his last two attempts. In the clean and jerk portion, Topurov completed a 175.0 kg clean and jerk after Süleymanoğlu. With his next two lifts, Süleymanoğlu set two more world records and won his first Olympic gold. His last lift was a 190.0 kg clean and jerk that was 3.15 times his body weight, which is the highest ratio clean and jerk to body weight of all time. Using the Sinclair coefficient, his performance at the 1988 Seoul Olympics was the most dominating weightlifting performance of all time. His total was high enough to win the weight class above his. After the 1988 Summer Olympics, Süleymanoğlu appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The 4&#x27;10&quot; Süleymanoğlu&#x27;s &quot;diminutive size and stunning strength&quot; led to him being nicknamed &quot;Pocket Hercules&quot;.

Süleymanoğlu retired from weightlifting at the age of 22 after winning the world championship in 1989. However, he returned to the sport in 1991 and won a second Olympic gold medal in Barcelona in 1992. He retired after winning a third consecutive Olympic gold medal in Atlanta at the 1996 Olympic Games. That competition was noted for the rivalry between Süleymanoğlu and Greece&#x27;s Valerios Leonidis, with the arena divided into partisan Turkish and Greek crowds. At the end of the competition, they were the last competitors remaining as they traded three straight world-record lifts. Süleymanoğlu managed to raise 187.5 kg, and then Leonidis failed in his attempt to lift 190 kg which earned Süleymanoğlu the gold medal. In a show of sportsmanship Süleymanoğlu embraced Leonidis, who had broken down in tears. Announcer Lynn Jones proclaimed, &quot;You have just witnessed the greatest weightlifting competition in history,&quot; according to Ken Jones of &quot;The Independent&quot;.

Süleymanoğlu made another comeback in a late attempt to earn a fourth gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, which would have been an Olympic record. However, he failed three attempts at 145 kg and was eliminated from the competition.

Süleymanoğlu is the first and only weightlifter to have snatched 2.5 times his body weight and also is the second of only seven lifters to date to clean and jerk three times his body weight. He is the only weightlifter to date to clean and jerk 10 kilos more than triple his bodyweight.

Over the course of his career, Süleymanoğlu has won seven World Weightlifting champion and three Olympic gold medals, and set a total of 46 world records. He was awarded the Olympic Order in 2001. In 2000 and 2004, he was elected a member of the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame. Süleymanoğlu is widely considered to have been the best pound-for-pound Olympic weightlifter of all time, and one of the greatest Olympic weightlifters ever. He is regarded as a national hero in Turkey.

==Political career==
At the 1999 general elections, Süleymanoğlu stood as an independent candidate to represent Bursa at the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. In 2002, he was the candidate of the Nationalist Movement Party for the mayor of Kıraç municipality in Büyükçekmece district of Istanbul Province; he represented the same party in general elections in 2006. Süleymanoğlu was unsuccessful in each of these bids for public office.

==Personal life and death==
Süleymanoğlu suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. In 2009, he was hospitalized for nearly three months.
On 25 September 2017, Süleymanoğlu was admitted to a hospital due to liver failure. On 6 October, a liver transplantation was made when a liver donor was found. On 11 November, he had surgery due to a hemorrhage in the brain and a subsequent edema. He died on 18 November 2017 and was interred at the Edirnekapı Martyr&#x27;s Cemetery in Istanbul.

After Süleymanoğlu&#x27;s death, a movie about his life and career, &quot;Cep Herkülü: Naim Süleymanoğlu&quot; was released in Turkey on November 22, 2019.

Süleymanoğlu&#x27;s grave was opened on July 4, 2018 for the purpose of extracting a DNA sample. Following his death, a Japanese woman had claimed that her daughter, Sekai Mori, had been fathered by him, and filed a paternity case at a Turkish court. A DNA test confirmed the paternity claim. Süleymanoğlu also had three daughters by a Turkish woman.

<text>IBM Research is the research and development division for IBM, an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries. IBM Research is the largest industrial research organization in the world and has twelve labs on six continents.

IBM employees have garnered six Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame, 19 National Medals of Technology, five National Medals of Science and three Kavli Prizes. , the company has generated more patents than any other business in each of 25 consecutive years, which is a record.

==History==

The roots of today&#x27;s IBM Research began with the 1945 opening of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University. This was the first IBM laboratory devoted to pure science and later expanded into additional IBM Research locations in Westchester County, New York, starting in the 1950s, including the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1961.

Notable company inventions include the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the Universal Product Code (UPC), the financial swap, the Fortran programming language, SABRE airline reservation system, DRAM, copper wiring in semiconductors, the smartphone, the portable computer, the Automated Teller Machine (ATM), the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor manufacturing process, Watson artificial intelligence and the Quantum Experience.

Advances in nanotechnology include IBM in atoms, where a scanning tunneling microscope was used to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three letter company acronym. It was the first time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.

Major undertakings at IBM Research have included the invention of innovative materials and structures, high-performance microprocessors and computers, analytical methods and tools, algorithms, software architectures, methods for managing, searching and deriving meaning from data and in turning IBM&#x27;s advanced services methodologies into reusable assets.

IBM Research&#x27;s numerous contributions to physical and computer sciences include the Scanning Tunneling Microscope and high-temperature superconductivity, both of which were awarded the Nobel Prize. IBM Research was behind the inventions of the SABRE travel reservation system, the technology of laser eye surgery, magnetic storage, the relational database, UPC barcodes and Watson, the question-answering computing system that won a match against human champions on the Jeopardy! television quiz show. The Watson technology is now being commercialized as part of a project with healthcare company Anthem Inc. Other notable developments include the Data Encryption Standard (DES), fast Fourier transform (FFT), Benoît Mandelbrot&#x27;s introduction of fractals, magnetic disk storage (hard disks), the MELD-Plus risk score, the one-transistor dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, relational databases, and Deep Blue (grandmaster-level chess-playing computer).

In 2017, IBM invested $240 million to create the MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab. Headquartered in Cambridge, MA, the Lab is a unique joint research venture in artificial intelligence established by IBM and MIT and brings together researchers in academia and industry to advance AI that has a real world impact for business, academic and society. The Lab funds approximately 50 projects per year, which are co-led by principal investigators from MIT and IBM Research, with results published regularly at top peer-reviewed journals and conferences. Projects range from computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning, to devising new ways to ensure that AI systems are fair, reliable and secure.

===Almaden in Silicon Valley===

IBM Research – Almaden is in Almaden Valley, San Jose, California. Its scientists perform basic and applied research in computer science, services, storage systems, physical sciences, and materials science and technology.

IBM Research – Almaden occupies part of a site owned by IBM at 650 Harry Road on nearly of land in the Santa Teresa Hills above Silicon Valley. The site, built in 1985 for the research center, was chosen because of its close proximity to Stanford University, UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley and other collaborative academic institutions. Today, the research division is still the largest tenant of the site, but the majority of occupants work for other divisions of IBM.

IBM opened its first West Coast research center, the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1952, managed by Reynold B. Johnson. Among its first developments was the IBM 350, the first commercial moving head hard disk drive. Launched in 1956, this saw use in the IBM 305 RAMAC computer system. Subdivisions included the Advanced Systems Development Division. Directors of the center include hard disc drive developer Jack Harker.

Prompted by a need for additional space, the center moved to its present Almaden location in 1986.

Scientists at IBM Almaden have contributed to several scientific discoveries such as the development of photoresists and the quantum mirage effect.

The following are some of the famous scientists who have worked in the past or are currently working in this laboratory: Rakesh Agrawal, Miklos Ajtai, Rama Akkiraju, John Backus, Raymond F. Boyce, Donald D. Chamberlin, Ashok K. Chandra, Edgar F. Codd, Mark Dean, Cynthia Dwork, Don Eigler, Ronald Fagin, Jim Gray, Laura M. Haas, Jean Paul Jacob, Joseph Halpern, Andreas J. Heinrich, Reynold B. Johnson, Maria Klawe, Jaishankar Menon, Dharmendra Modha, William E. Moerner, C. Mohan, Stuart Parkin, Nick Pippenger, Dan Russell, Patricia Selinger, Ted Selker, Barbara Simons, Malcolm Slaney, Arnold Spielberg, Ramakrishnan Srikant, Larry Stockmeyer, Moshe Vardi, Jennifer Widom, Shumin Zhai.

===Australia===
IBM Research – Australia was a research and development laboratory established by IBM Research in 2009 in Melbourne. It was involved in social media, interactive content, healthcare analytics and services research, multimedia analytics, and genomics. The lab was headed by several directors over its 10 years lifespan, including Vice President, Joanna Batstone and Professor Iven Mareels. It was to be the company’s first laboratory combining research and development in a single organisation.

The opening of the Melbourne lab in 2011 received an injection of $22 million in Australian Federal Government funding and an undisclosed amount provided by the State Government.

The Melbourne Research lab was closed in 2021, approximately at the same time as the deal for tax breaks from the State Government ended. Approximately 80 full-time researchers were made redundant.

===Brazil===
IBM Research – Brazil is one of twelve research laboratories comprising IBM Research, its first in South America. It was established in 2011, with locations in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Research focuses on Industrial Technology and Science, Systems of Engagement and Insight, Social Data Analytics and Natural Resources Solutions.

The new lab, IBM&#x27;s ninth at the time of opening and first in 12 years, underscores the growing importance of emerging markets and the globalization of innovation. In collaboration with Brazil&#x27;s government, it will help IBM to develop technology systems around natural resource development and large-scale events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Engineer and associate lab director Ulisses Mello explains that IBM has four priority areas in Brazil: &quot;The main area is related to natural resources management, involving oil and gas, mining and agricultural sectors. The second is the social data analytics segment that comprises the analysis of data generated from social networking sites [such as Twitter or Facebook], which can be applied, for example, to financial analysis. The third strategic area is nanotechnology applied to the development of the smarter devices for the intermittent production industry. This technology can be applied to, for example, blood testing or recovering oil from existing fields. And the last one is smarter cities.&quot;

===Japan===
The IBM Research – Tokyo, which was called IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory (TRL) before January 2009, is one of IBM&#x27;s twelve major worldwide research laboratories. It is a branch of IBM Research, and about 200 researchers work for TRL. Established in 1982 as the Japan Science Institute (JSI) in Tokyo, it was renamed to IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory in 1986, and moved to Yamato in 1992 and back to Tokyo in 2012.

IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory was established in 1982 as the Japan Science Institute (JSI) in Sanbanchō, Tokyo. It was IBM&#x27;s first research laboratory in Asia. Hisashi Kobayashi was appointed the founding director of TRL in 1982; he served as director until 1986. JSI was renamed to the IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory in 1986. In 1988, English-to-Japanese machine translation system called &quot;System for Human-Assisted Language Translation&quot; (SHALT) was developed at TRL. It was used to translate IBM manuals.

====History====
TRL was shifted from downtown Tokyo to the suburbs to share a building with IBM Yamato Facility in Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1993. In 1993, world record was accomplished for generation of continuous coherent Ultraviolet rays. In 1996, Java JIT compiler was developed at TRL, and it was released for major IBM platforms. Numerous other technological breakthroughs were made at TRL.

The team led by Chieko Asakawa (:ja:浅川智恵子), IBM Fellow since 2009, provided basic technology for IBM&#x27;s software programs for the visually handicapped, IBM Home Page Reader in 1997 and IBM aiBrowser (:ja:aiBrowser) in 2007. TRL moved back to Tokyo in 2012, this time at IBM Toyosu Facility.

====Research====
TRL researchers are responsible for numerous breakthroughs in sciences and engineering. The researchers have presented multiple papers at international conferences, and published numerous papers in international journals. They have also contributed to the products and services of IBM, and patent filings. TRL conducts research in microdevices, system software, security and privacy, analytics and optimization, human computer interaction, embedded systems, and services sciences.

====Other activities====
TRL collaborates with the Japanese universities, and support their research programs. IBM donates its equipment such as servers, storage systems, and so forth to the Japanese universities to support their research programs under the Shared University Research (SUR) program.

In 1987, IBM Japan Science Prize was created to recognize researchers, who are not over 45 years old, working at Japanese universities or public research institutes. It is awarded in physics, chemistry, computer science, and electronics.

===Israel===

IBM Research – Haifa, previously known as the Haifa Research Lab (HRL) was founded as a small scientific center in 1972. Since then, it has grown into a major lab that leads the development of innovative technologies and solutions for the IBM corporation. The lab’s offices are situated in three locations across Israel: Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Beer Sheva.

IBM Research – Haifa employs researchers in a range of areas. Research projects are being executed today in areas such as artificial intelligence, hybrid cloud, quantum computing, blockchain, IoT, quality, cybersecurity, and industry domains such as healthcare.

Aya Soffer is IBM Vice President of AI Technology and serves as the Director of the IBM Research Lab in Haifa, Israel.

====History====

In its 30th year, the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel moved to a new home on the University of Haifa campus.

The researchers at the Lab are involved in special projects with academic institutions across Israel, the United States, and Europe, and actively participate in numerous consortiums as part of the EU Horizon 2020 programme. Today in 2020, the Lab describes itself as having the highest number of employees in Israel&#x27;s hi-tech industry who hold advanced degrees in science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Researchers participate in international conferences and are published in professional publications.

In 2014, IBM Research announced the Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (CCoE) in Beer Sheva in collaboration with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

===Switzerland===
IBM Research – Zurich (previously called IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, ZRL) is the European branch of IBM Research. It was opened in 1956 and is located in Rüschlikon near Zürich, Switzerland.

In 1956, IBM opened their first European research laboratory in Adliswil, Switzerland. The lab moved to its own campus in neighboring Rüschlikon in 1962. The Zürich lab is staffed by a multicultural and interdisciplinary team of a few hundred permanent research staff members, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, representing about 45 nationalities. Collocated with the lab is a &quot;Client Center&quot; (formerly the &quot;Industry Solutions Lab&quot;), an executive briefing facility demonstrating technology prototypes and solutions.

The Zürich lab is world-renowned for its scientific achievements—most notably Nobel Prizes in physics in 1986 and 1987 for the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope and the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, respectively. Other key inventions include trellis modulation, which revolutionized data transmission over telephone lines; Token Ring, which became a standard for local area networks and a highly successful IBM product; the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) standard used for highly secure payments; and the Java Card OpenPlatform (JCOP), a smart card operating system. Most recently the lab was involved in the development of SuperMUC, a supercomputer that is cooled using hot water.

The Zürich lab focus areas are future chip technologies; nanotechnology; data storage; quantum computing, brain-inspired computing; security and privacy; risk and compliance; business optimization and transformation; server systems. The Zürich laboratory is involved in many joint projects with universities throughout Europe, in research programs established by the European Union and the Swiss government, and in cooperation agreements with research institutes of industrial partners. One of the lab&#x27;s most high-profile projects is called DOME, which is based on developing an IT roadmap for the Square Kilometer Array.

The research projects pursued at the IBM Zürich lab are organized into four scientific and technical departments: Science &amp; Technology, Cloud and AI Systems Research, Cognitive Computing &amp; Industry Solutions and Security Research. The lab is currently managed by Alessandro Curioni.

On 17 May 2011, IBM and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich opened the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center, which is located on the same campus in Rüschlikon.

== IBM Scientific Centers ==
In addition to the IBM Research Division, the IBM Scientific Centers, which were active in various functions from 1964 to the early 1990s, were another remarkable research unit. In contrast to the central control of the Research Division from the headquarters in Armonk in the USA, the IBM Scientific Centers were structured in a decentralized manner. Each center functioned as an integral part of the IBM organization in its respective region or country. This organization also financed the center and ultimately determined its content and strategic direction. The task of an IBM Scientific Center was to contribute with its research, its expertise and its cooperation projects for the benefit of the respective country and thus to contribute to the reputation of IBM in this country or this region.

While the research laboratories of the IBM Research Division had to be very restrictive with regard to scientific cooperation projects with non-IBM institutions for patent reasons and other reasons, technical-scientific and application-oriented cooperation projects with universities and other public research institutions were an important part of IBM&#x27;s mission for the scientific centers. Because of this, the spectrum of activities of such a center was often very broad. For example, some research groups could deal with topics that can be assigned to basic or product-oriented research, while others dealt with application-oriented research topics, for example satellite-based soil classification.

Descriptions of the thematic focus and research projects as well as a selection of references to the scientific publications of the individual centers, as far as they were still alive in 1989, can be found in. A comprehensive description of the evolution, projects, and success stories of the IBM Heidelberg Scientific Center from its very beginning and to shortly before its end can be found in.

The history of the IBM Scientific Centers began in 1964 with the founding of the first four centers in the USA (marked with * in the list below) and has subsequently grown to 26 centers worldwide in 1989. Their story ended in the early 1990s.

<text>Pully () is a municipality in Switzerland in the canton of Vaud, located in the district of Lavaux-Oron. It is one of the eastern suburbs of the city of Lausanne, located on the shores of Lake Geneva (&quot;Lac Léman&quot;) and at the foot of the vineyards of Lavaux on the road to Vevey and Montreux.

==History==
Pully is first mentioned in 994 as &quot;Pulliacum&quot;.

===Prehistory===
In 1826 a neolithic cemetery with about 30 graves was uncovered at Pierra-Portray. However, the artifacts were not fully preserved and only one flint blade and a soapstone fragment still exist. Near Pierra-Portray, along the Chemin de Chamblandes, Albert Naef examined 23 tombs from 1901 to 1910. These tombs belonging to a similar set of tombs which were sporadically excavated and recorded between 1880 and 1993. The local rectangular graves consisted of boxes assembled from four vertical slabs of about in length, with a fifth plate that served as a lid. The dead were lying on their left side with their legs drawn up to the chest and the head pointed to the east. The largest find of stone box graves in Pully was the cemetery at Chamblandes. Due to the number of finds at Chamblandes, all similar cist or stone box graves in the surrounding area came to be known as Chamblandes type graves. The cemetery of Chamblandes extends over a length of about a hundred meters (yards) and included 76 graves and over 100 skeletons. This Middle Neolithic (4300-3900 BC) graveyard included as grave goods; ocher, various commodities (polished stone ax) and jewelry (wild boar tusks, pendants made of shells, coral and lignite). Two collars, one needle, a dagger and a bronze knife-blade hatchet are attributed to an early Bronze Age grave. In 1992 a cremation grave was discovered that dated from the Late Bronze Age.

===Roman villa===
In the 1970s, while working on foundation of a terrace of the Le Prieuré building, the corner of a large Roman era villa was discovered. The villa dates from the period between the second half of the 1st century and 4th century AD. The accompanying small thermal baths, a monumental pool and several walls were already known from earlier excavations. The heart of the east wing of the villa is a multi-level, semi-circular pavilion. The lower hall is decorated with, in situ preserved, wall paintings which represent a chariot race. The painting dates from the first quarter of the 2nd century. Finds from the 4th and 5th centuries show that the site was also, at least partially populated, during the late antiquity period. Between the 5th and 6th century, the baths were converted into a Christian burial chapel with numerous burials.

===Medieval Pully===
During the Carolingian era the additional buildings were built around the burial chapel. During the Early Middle Ages (5th-7th century) a cemetery was operating at Les Déserts.

In the 10th century the royal family of Burgundy granted their vineyards at Pully to Payerne Priory. The priory retained this land in Pully until 1536. In 1079, Bishop Burkhard of Oltigen received some property from the Emperor in Pully. This land had previously belonged to Rudolf of Swabia. From then on, the Bishop of Lausanne possessed the jurisdiction right over the bailiwick of Pully. The Bishop first granted the bailiwick to the Lords of Faucigny, then in 1276 to the de Thoire-Villars family. Two officers, the &quot;Sautier&quot; or &quot;Weibel&quot; and the Seneschal, were responsible for the judiciary. The Counts of Geneva, the Geneva-Lullin family, were the Seneschals until 1536 and were practically the rulers of Pully. A number of other religious and secular leaders owned land or rights in the village. Until 1555, the Counts of Gruyère were one of the largest landowners in the area. In 1509, Bern and Fribourg mediated between the Count of Gruyere and the citizens of Pully. The market buildings in Pully were used until at least 1558.

The municipality began to become a partly independent town in the 13th century and received its charter () in 1368. The town was administered by a twelve-member council until 1719, when it became an eleven-member group. The council was led by a knight banneret.

===Early Modern and Modern Pully===
In 1536, the town of Pully came under the administration of the cities of Bern and Lausanne. Lausanne renounced their rights in 1717. From 1536 until 1798 it belonged to the Bailiwick of Lausanne. Then, from 1798 until 2006, it was in the district of Lausanne. The Le Prieuré building was originally the priory court of the Priory of Payerne. Under the Bernese it served as a wine cellar and vineyard house.

The original parish church was probably dedicated to St. Maurice starting in the 9th century. Between the 14th and 16th century, it was rebuilt and consecrated to St. Germann. It burned down in 2001 and was rebuilt again in 2004. After the Reformation, the parish also included Paudex and Belmont, which became independent in 1897. The parsonage was built between 1594 and rebuilt in 1723. The church in Chamblandes dates from 1938, the one in La Rosiaz from 1953 and the Catholic Parish of St. Mauritius was created in 1954.

<text>Black Books is a British sitcom created by Dylan Moran and Graham Linehan, and written by Moran, Kevin Cecil, Andy Riley, Linehan and Arthur Mathews. It was broadcast on Channel 4, running for three series from 2000 to 2004. Starring Dylan Moran as Bernard Black, Bill Bailey as Manny Bianco, and Tamsin Greig as Fran Katzenjammer, the series is set in the eponymous London bookshop and follows the lives of its owner, his assistant, and their friend. The series was produced by Big Talk Productions, in association with Channel 4.

The show was produced in a multiple-camera setup, and was primarily filmed at Teddington Studios in Teddington, London, with exterior scenes filmed on location on Leigh Street and the surrounding areas in Bloomsbury, London. The first episode was broadcast on 29 September 2000 and a total of three series were made, the final episode airing on 15 April 2004.

&quot;Black Books&quot; was a critical success, winning awards, including two BAFTAs (for Best Situation Comedy in 2001 and 2005) and a Bronze Rose at the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or.

== Synopsis ==
Bernard Black is the owner of Black Books, a small London bookshop. The series revolves around the lives of Bernard, Manny and Fran. Bernard&#x27;s persona of a grouchy and misanthropic shopkeeper is a central theme; he has a hatred of the outside world and all the people who inhabit it, except for his best friend, Fran, who initially runs a trendy bric-a-brac shop, Nifty Gifty, next door to the bookshop.

Bernard displays little interest or knowledge in retail (or, indeed, anything outside drinking, smoking and reading) and actively avoids having to interact with anyone, even inside his shop. He would often rather pass up on a sale than have to engage in human interaction to make one. 

Manny is introduced in the first episode as an angst-ridden accountant who enters the bookshop seeking &quot;The Little Book of Calm&quot;. During a drunken night out, Bernard offers him a job as a shop assistant and a room above the shop if he will do Bernard&#x27;s accounts for him. Sobering up, Bernard realises Manny&#x27;s optimistic nature is not suited to this &quot;kind of operation&quot;. Fran, however, seeing that Manny is good for Bernard, forces Bernard to let him stay.

== Cast ==

The series revolves around the three main characters of Bernard Ludwig Black (Dylan Moran), Manny Bianco (Bill Bailey) and Fran Katzenjammer (Tamsin Greig), who all appear in every episode. Other characters appear briefly in single episodes, while the show also featured several guest stars such as Keith Allen, Rob Brydon, Annette Crosbie, Lucy Davis, Olivia Colman and Peter Serafinowicz.

== Production ==
A pilot for the show was featured in the 1998 Channel 4 sitcom festival in Riverside Studios. This early version was decidedly darker, revolving around Bernard&#x27;s, and later Manny&#x27;s, decision to commit suicide. It featured Manny (surname Zimmerman in reference to Bob Dylan) and the Fran character as Valerie, a philosophy lecturer.

The pilot was an original creation of Moran&#x27;s and the series was his first creation as a writer for a television series. Linehan, co-writer of the earlier Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, joined at the outset to co-write the series with Moran at the suggestion of producer William Burdett-Coutts after Linehan saw the pilot and had seen Moran performing in Dublin. The characters were Moran&#x27;s original creation, created over a month-long process he calls &quot;spitballing&quot;, which is talking spontaneously to each other in character.

The concept of Bernard owning a bookshop came about because of Moran&#x27;s view of bookshops as doomed enterprises. Moran said &quot;Running a second-hand bookshop is a guaranteed commercial failure. It&#x27;s a whole philosophy. There were bookshops that I frequented and I was always struck by the loneliness and doggedness of these men who piloted this death ship&quot;, while Linehan said his belligerent personality reflected a sign he once saw in a bookshop stating &quot;Please put the books anywhere you like because we&#x27;ve got nothing better to do than put them back&quot;. Moran said of the series, &quot;We just wanted to cram as much elaborate stupidity into a half-hour that could make it be coherent and that you would believe&quot;.

The fictional address for the bookshop is &quot;Black Books&quot;, 13 Little Bevan Street, Bloomsbury, London WC1. Manny also states the shop is located &quot;just off Russell Square&quot;. The exterior scenes of the bookshop were filmed outside a real bookshop, albeit a smaller one, called Collinge &amp; Clark, located at 13 Leigh Street, Bloomsbury.

The audio commentary for &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; states that &quot;Black Books&quot; is considered by the producers to be a sister show of the 1999 Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;, also produced by Nira Park. The show features several actors from &quot;Spaced&quot;, while in one episode Manny is heard speaking to Twist Morgan, a character from &quot;Spaced&quot;. Simon Pegg guest-starred as Bill Bailey&#x27;s boss in another episode, an inversion of their roles in &quot;Spaced&quot;; Nick Frost appeared at the beginning of the episode &quot;The Big Lockout&quot; to install a new security system for the shop, though lost Manny&#x27;s attention when he spotted a Subbuteo player in his hair; Kevin Cecil, one of the &quot;Black Books&quot; writers, appeared in &quot;Spaced&quot; playing the leader of &quot;Robot Club&quot;; Jessica Stevenson made an appearance as a friend of Fran&#x27;s, who was trying to help her live a healthier lifestyle with attempts to change her diet and get her to exercise more; Peter Serafinowicz played a radio broadcaster whose dulcet tones reading the shipping forecast drove Fran wild with desire; Omid Djalili appeared in &quot;He&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; as an opportunistic photographer; Rob Brydon appeared in Season 2&#x27;s episode &quot;The Fixer&quot;. Both Lucy Davis (&quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;) and Olivia Colman (&quot;Peep Show&quot;, &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;) appeared in Season 3&#x27;s episode &quot;Elephants and Hens&quot;.

&quot;Black Books&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy in 2001 and 2005, and won a Bronze Rose at the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or of Montreux in 2001. It also received nominations for British Comedy Awards and the Irish Film and Television Awards.

According to Allan Brown, writing for &quot;The Times&quot; in August 2005, the show was &quot;killed off after three hugely popular series&quot;.

In Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Comedy Characters&quot; poll, Bernard was voted 19th. The show ranked 58th out of 100 in the BBC&#x27;s Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.

==Legacy==
When asked by Digital Spy in 2015 about the show possibly returning, Moran replied saying &quot;No, no, no, no! No! Does that answer the question, no!&quot; and stated that he&#x27;d rather focus on new projects. He also said that he&#x27;d never do another studio sitcom again.

<text>Gunfighters, also called gunslingers () or in the late 19th and early 20th century gunmen, were individuals in the American Old West who gained a reputation of being dangerous with a gun and participated in shootouts. Today, the term &quot;gunslinger&quot; is more or less used to denote someone who is quick on the draw with a handgun, but this can also refer to those armed with rifles and shotguns. The gunfighter is also one of the most popular characters in the Western genre and has appeared in associated films, television shows, video games, and literature.

A gunfighter could be a lawman, outlaw, cowboy, or shooting exhibitionist, but the professional gunfighter was a mercenary &quot;hired gun&quot; () who made a living with his weapons in the Old West, selling his services to the highest bidder.

==Origin of the term==
The term &quot;gunslinger&quot; was used in the Western film &quot;Drag Harlan&quot; (1920). The word was soon adopted by other Western writers, such as Zane Grey, and became common usage. In his introduction to &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976), author Glendon Swarthout says &quot;gunslinger&quot; and &quot;gunfighter&quot; are modern terms, and the more authentic terms for the period would have been &quot;gunman&quot;, &quot;pistoleer&quot;, &quot;shootist&quot;, or &quot;bad man&quot; (sometimes written as &quot;badman&quot;). Swarthout seems to have been correct about &quot;gunslinger&quot;, but the term &quot;gunfighter&quot; existed in several newspapers in the 1870s, and as such the term existed in the 19th century. Bat Masterson used the term &quot;gunfighter&quot; in the newspaper articles which he wrote about the lawmen and outlaws whom he had known. However, Joseph Rosa noted that, even though Masterson used the term &quot;gunfighter&quot;, he &quot;preferred the term &#x27;mankiller when discussing these individuals. Clay Allison (1841–1887), a notorious New Mexico and Texas gunman and cattleman, originated the term &quot;shootist&quot;.

Often, the term has been applied to men who would hire out for contract killings or at a ranch embroiled in a range war where they would earn &quot;fighting wages&quot;. Others, like Billy the Kid, were notorious bandits, and still others were lawmen like Pat Garrett and Wyatt Earp. A gunfighter could be an outlaw—a robber or murderer who took advantage of the wilderness of the frontier to hide from genteel society and to make periodic raids on it. The gunfighter could also be an agent of the state, archetypically a lone avenger, but more often a sheriff, whose duty was to face the outlaw and bring him to justice or to personally administer it. There were also a few historical cowboys who were actual gunfighters, such as the Cochise County Cowboys who participated in the bloody 1879 Skeleton Canyon massacre.

==Depiction in culture==
Gunslingers frequently appear as stock characters in Western movies and novels, along with cowboys. Often, the hero of a Western meets his opposite &quot;double&quot;, a mirror of his own evil side that he has to destroy.
Western gunslinger heroes are portrayed as local lawmen or enforcement officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle – courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering from place to place with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).

In films, the gunslinger often possesses a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen of the big screen. In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.

Another classic bit of cinema that is largely a myth is the showdown at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, as in the case of the Luke Short–Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. 

When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger&#x27;s reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.

In the days of the Old West, tales tended to grow with repeated telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Cochise County Cowboys, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.

==Fact and fiction==
Most gunfights are portrayed in films or books as having two men square off, waiting for one to make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. 

In popular folklore, men who held noteworthy reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.

These fights were usually close-up and personal, with a number of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild. Much of the time, it would be difficult to tell who had &quot;won&quot; the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air. How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a &quot;blaze of glory&quot;. Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness.

Mythology and folklore often exaggerate the skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known to be capable of trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent&#x27;s belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman&#x27;s rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents&#x27; hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The last was debunked by &quot;Mythbusters&quot; as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.

In Western movies, the characters&#x27; gun belts are often worn low on the hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol&#x27;s trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands. 

Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the &quot;Gun that Won the West&quot;, it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for &quot;express messengers&quot; and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who were in charge of overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.

Quick draw and hip shooting were rare skills in the West, and only a handful of historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, and Wild Bill Hickok. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.

Gunfighters King Fisher, John Wesley Hardin, Ben Thompson, Billy the Kid, Wild Bill Hickok, and Pat Garrett all died as a result of ambushes, killed by men who feared them because of their reputation. Gunmen Kid Curry, Jim Courtright, Dallas Stoudenmire and Dave Rudabaugh were killed in raging gun battles, much as portrayed in films about the era, and usually against more than one opponent. Bill Longley and Tom Horn were executed. Famed gunman Clay Allison died in a wagon accident. Gunmen Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Bass Reeves, Commodore Perry Owens, and Luke Short all died of natural causes, living out their lives on reputation and avoiding conflict in secluded retirement. Gunfighter and lawman Frank Eaton, known as &quot;Pistol Pete&quot; lived into old age and gained further fame, before his death at age 97, by becoming the mascot for Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University). Rare are the gunfighters who, like William Sidney &quot;Cap&quot; Light, died accidentally by their own hand.

==Famous gunfights==


The frequency and drama of gunfights in the &quot;Wild West&quot; were highly exaggerated by dime novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known took place in the states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 

Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, and when gunfights did occur, their causes varied. Some were unpremeditated fights incited by strong emotions, while others were the results of longstanding feuds, or were between criminals and law enforcement. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and conflicts between white Americans and indigenous peoples were also causes. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others are lost to history. To prevent gunfights, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, issued local ordinances to prohibit firearms in the area.

The gunfight at the O.K. Corral is a famous example of a real-life western shootout, between the Earp Brothers together with Doc Holliday, and the Clanton-McLaury gang. It lasted only 30 seconds, contrary to many movie adaptations. The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols. Both parties simultaneously drew their guns, which added to the confusion about who fired first. 

It is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt&#x27;s bullet was the first to hit, tearing through Frank McLaury&#x27;s belly and sending McLaury&#x27;s own shot wild through Wyatt&#x27;s coattail. Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan&#x27;s shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. &quot;Go to fighting or get away!&quot;, Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom McLaury with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple. Wounded and dying, Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil&#x27;s leg. Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy.

On April 14, 1881, lawman Dallas Stoudenmire participated in a gunfight in El Paso, Texas which many dubbed the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight, in which he killed three of the four fatalities with his twin .44 caliber Colt revolvers. One of those killed was an innocent Mexican bystander. Less than a year after these incidents, he would kill as many as six more men in gunfights while in the line of duty.

Another well-documented gunfight resulted in the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854. Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out of the brush, pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way.Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being &quot;in a fever of excitement at the time.&quot; Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws&#x27; bullets tore at Davis&#x27;s clothing but caused only two slight flesh wounds. 

Within moments, seven of the bandits were dead or dying on the ground and Davis&#x27;s pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis whipped out his Bowie knife and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both.

On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came face-to-face against 80 gunmen which became known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn, the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and over the course of a 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, at age 80.

In January 1887, Commodore Perry Owens took office as Sheriff of Apache County, Arizona. He sent two deputies to arrest Ike Clanton. Clanton had instigated the Gunfight at the OK Corral and was charged with the later ambush shooting of Virgil Earp. Wyatt Earp searched for Ike Clanton in his vendetta, but never found him – Ike moved north to Apache County to continue rustling cattle and killing. Owens&#x27; two deputies killed Ike Clanton; Phin Clanton was arrested; three other gang members were killed; and the Clanton gang was done. Then Sheriff Owens turned his attention to the Blevins family, the other rustling gang in the county. 

In June 1887 Old Man Blevins disappeared, presumably killed by the Tewksbury faction of the Pleasant Valley War. The Blevins sons searched for their father and in August Hamp Blevins and another were killed by the Tewksbury side. So Andy Blevins (aka Cooper) ambushed and killed John Tewksbury and Bill Jacobs in revenge. Blevins returned to Holbrook and was heard bragging about his killings. 

Sheriff Owens had inherited a warrant for Andy Blevins&#x27; (Cooper) arrest for horse theft so he rode to Holbook on September 2, 1887. Sheriff Owens had hunted buffalo for the railroad and could shoot his Winchester from the hip with great accuracy. Cradling his Winchester rifle in his arm, Sheriff Owens knocked on the Blevins&#x27; door. Andy Blevins answered with a pistol in hand, the lawman told him to come out, that he had a warrant for arrest. Blevins refused and tried to close the door. Owens shot his rifle from his hip through the door, hitting Andy Blevins in the stomach. Andy&#x27;s half-brother, John Blevins, pushed a pistol out the door to Owens&#x27; right and fired at the Sheriff. He missed and Owens shot John Blevins in the arm, putting him out of the fight. Owens saw Andy Blevins in the window moving to shoot back. Owens shot through the wall, striking Andy in the right hip – he died that night. Mose Roberts, boarding with the family, jumped out of a side window with a pistol. Sheriff Owens shot him through his back and chest, killing him. Fifteen-year-old Samuel Houston Blevins ran out the front door, with his brother&#x27;s revolver, and yelled &quot;I&#x27;ll get him.&quot; His mother ran out after him. Owens shot and Sam fell backward, dying in his mother&#x27;s arms. The shootout took less than one minute and made Owens a legend. In eight months Sheriff Owens had rid Apache County of two notorious gangs of rustlers and killers.

In many early western films and literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having conflicts and battles against gunfighters and White settlements. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), an estimated 19,000 White men, women, and children were killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30,000 and 45,000 casualties during the American Indian Wars. Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans. Among them was civilian Billy Dixon, who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills, by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a mile away with his Sharps rifle, during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls.

General George S. Patton himself had a gunfight when he was a young second lieutenant chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa&#x27;s men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.

===Real-life Wild West duels===
The image of two gunslingers with violent reputations squaring off in a street is a Hollywood invention. However, face-to-face fast draw shootouts did occur in the real West. These duels were first recorded in the South, brought by emigrants to the American Frontier as a crude form of the &quot;code duello,&quot; a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry. By the second half of the 19th century, few Americans still fought duels to solve their problems, and it became a thing of the past in the United States by the start of the 20th century. Writer Wyatt-Brown in his book &quot;Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South&quot; described dueling in the American frontier as a &quot;custom&quot;, and was primarily used for teenage disputes, rise in rank, status, and scapegoating.

The most famous and well-recorded duel occurred on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri. Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and decided to have a gunfight. They arranged to walk toward each other at 6 pm. Wild Bill&#x27;s armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok&#x27;s shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt&#x27;s shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1867 and became a staple of the gunslinger legend.

The famous lawman Wyatt Earp gave an account of having participated in a duel once during his vendetta. While in the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains, Earp&#x27;s posse found one of the outlaw cowboys named &quot;Indian Charlie&quot; Cruz. One account says that after the party recognized Cruz, they chased him down and a gunfight ensued. The party managed to capture Cruz and he confessed to having taken part in Morgan&#x27;s murder, and that he identified Stilwell, Hank Swilling, Curly Bill, and Johnny Ringo as other of Morgan&#x27;s killers. During that time, Wyatt allowed Cruz to keep his revolver to &quot;give him a chance to fight like a man.&quot; After the confession, Wyatt told Cruz to draw, challenging him to a duel, and the posse counted to three before Wyatt gunned Cruz down.

The Langford–Peel shootout occurred on July 22, 1867, between gunmen John Bull and Langford Peel.

Doc Holliday himself had a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One of the women who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been discharged from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce&#x27;s hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.

Another well-known duel in the American West happened in Fort Worth, Texas, and was known as the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel. Timothy Isaiah &quot;Longhair Jim&quot; Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided &quot;protection&quot; to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright&#x27;s, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to &quot;go to Hell,&quot; and that he could do anything that was necessary to take care of his business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short&#x27;s side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, blowing off Courtright&#x27;s thumb. Courtright attempted the &quot;border shift&quot;, a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand, but he was too slow. Short shot him in the chest, killing him.

The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, involving Levi Richardson, a buffalo hunter, and &quot;Cockeyed Frank&quot; Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving&#x27;s wife Mattie, and the two began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and took a seat at the same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty &amp; Kelley&#x27;s Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving&#x27;s Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on his hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner&#x27;s inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.

On March 9, 1877, gamblers Jim Levy and Charlie Harrison argued over a game of cards in a saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They met in an alley following an argument about a card game. Harrison shot first but missed. Levy aimed carefully and hit Harrison, who died a week later.

Not as well known today but famous in his time was the dapper, derby-wearing train robber Marion Hedgepeth, who despite his swell appearance, &quot;was a deadly killer and one of the fastest guns in the Wild, Wild West&quot;. William Pinkerton, whose National Detective Agency had sought to capture Hedgepeth and his gang for years, noted that Hedgepeth once gunned down another outlaw who had already unholstered his pistol before Hedgepath had drawn his revolver. The infamous assassin Tom Horn was also said to have participated in a duel with a second lieutenant from the Mexican Army, due to a dispute with a prostitute when he was twenty-six years old. Gunfighters Jim Levy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes.

==Living on reputation==
Most Old West men who were labeled as being &quot;gunfighters&quot; did not kill nearly as many men in gunfights as they were given credit for, if any at all. They were often labeled as such due to one particular instance, which developed from rumors about them having been involved in many more events than they actually were. Often their reputation was as much &quot;self-promotion&quot; as anything else; such was the case of Bat Masterson. Wyatt Earp with his brothers Morgan and Virgil along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaw Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. He has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime. But Prof. Bill O&#x27;Neal cites just five incidents in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters&quot;. Earp expressed his dismay about the controversy that followed him his entire life. He wrote in a letter to John Hays Hammond on May 21, 1925, that &quot;notoriety had been the bane of my life.&quot;

After his brother Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men suspected of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt and his brother Warren set out on a vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because he was the only one who was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt&#x27;s assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; published two years after Wyatt&#x27;s death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.

There are no records to support the reputation that Johnny Ringo developed. Of the documented instances where Ringo killed men, they were unarmed, and there is no evidence to support his participation in a single gunfight. Others deserved the reputation associated with them. Jim Courtright and Dallas Stoudenmire both killed several men in gunfights both as lawmen and as civilians. Clay Allison and Ben Thompson had well-deserved reputations. At the same time, gunmen like Scott Cooley are all but unknown, when they actually led a life reflective of what most would consider a gunfighter to be. 

In other cases, certain gunfighters were possibly confused, over time, with being someone else with a similar name. The most well-known of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch gang, the Sundance Kid, was in reality only known to have been in one shootout during his lifetime, and no gunfights. Some historians have since stated that it is possible that over time he was confused with another Wild Bunch member, Kid Curry, who was without a doubt the most dangerous member of the gang, having killed many lawmen and civilians during his lifetime before being killed himself. Hence, it is the Sundance Kid who is better known.

==Outlaw or lawman==
It is often difficult to separate lawmen of the Old West from outlaws of the Old West. In many cases, the term &quot;gunfighter&quot; was applied to constables. Despite idealistic portrayals in television, movies, and even in history books, very few lawmen/gunfighters could claim their law enforcement role as their only source of employment. Unlike contemporary peace officers, these lawmen generally pursued other occupations, often earning money as gamblers, business owners, or outlaws—as was the case with &quot;Curly&quot; Bill Brocius, who, while always referred to as an outlaw, served as a deputy sheriff under sheriff Johnny Behan. Many shootouts involving lawmen were caused by disputes arising from these alternative occupations, rather than the lawman&#x27;s attempts to enforce the law.

Tom Horn, historically cited as an assassin, served both as a deputy sheriff and as a Pinkerton detective, a job in which he shot at least three people as a killer for hire. Ben Thompson, best known as a gunfighter and gambler, was a very successful chief of police in Austin, Texas. King Fisher had great success as a county sheriff in Texas. Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid both wore badges as lawmen at least once. &quot;Big&quot; Steve Long served as deputy marshal for Laramie, Wyoming, while the entire time committing murders and forced theft of land deeds. A town with a substantial violent crime rate would often turn to a known gunman as their town marshal, chief, or sheriff, in the hopes that the gunman could stem the violence and bring order.

Known gunmen/lawmen were generally effective, and in time the violence would subside, usually, after the gunman/lawman had been involved in several shooting incidents, eventually leading to a substantial and well-earned fear that kept everyone in line. At times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars. Although sanctioned by law enforcement officials, the gunmen were not always actually deputized. Sometimes, however, just to make things &quot;official&quot;, they would go through the formality of deputization. A case in point: the service of the Jesse Evans Gang, and outlaw Jesse Evans himself, as agents for the Murphy-Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War. While technically working as lawmen, they were little more than hired guns.

Usually, when a gunman was hired by a town as town marshal, they received the full support of the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate it was time for a change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.

==Legacy==

===Modern gunslinger===

People relive the Wild West both historically and in popular culture by participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts his or her own look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and as part of that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the US and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There&#x27;s the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy, and duelist – each with its own specifications.

Alongside the iconic cowboy, gunfighters have become a cultural image of the American people abroad, and also as an idealized image of violence, frontier justice, and adventure. Even outside of the Western genre, the term &#x27;gunslinger&#x27; has been used in modern times to describe someone who is fast and accurate with pistols, either in real life or in other fictional action genres.

The quick draw which gunfighters help popularize, is still an important skill in the American military and law enforcement communities.

===In popular culture===

Gunfighters have been featured in media even outside the Western genre, often combined with other elements and genres, mainly science-fiction space Westerns, steampunk, and the contemporary setting. Abilities, clothing, and attitude associated with gunfighters are seen in many other genres. An example of this is &quot;Han shot first&quot;, in which Han Solo, a gunfighter-like protagonist in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, kills his opponent with a subtle, under-the-table draw. He also wore his holster low on, and tied to, the thigh with a cutaway for the trigger. Roland Deschain from the fantasy series &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is a gunfighter pitted against fantasy-themed monsters and enemies. Inspired by the &quot;Man with No Name&quot; and other spaghetti-western characters, he himself is detached or unsympathetic, often reacting as uncaring or angry at signs of cowardice or self-pity, yet he possesses a strong sense of heroism, often attempting to help those in need, a morality much seen in Westerns.

Jonah Hex, from DC Comics, is a ruthless bounty hunter bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent. IGN ranked Jonah Hex the 73rd greatest comic book hero of all time. Throughout the DC Universe, Hex has been, on many occasions, transported from the Old West to the contemporary setting and beyond. Even in unfamiliar territory and time periods, Hex managed to outgun his enemies with more advanced weaponry. Two-Gun Kid is another comic book gunfighter from Marvel Comics. Skilled with revolvers, he has aided many superheroes in future timelines, most notably She-Hulk.

Many Japanese manga and anime have also adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow is known for creating the space Western &quot;Trigun&quot;. The story&#x27;s protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre-themed manga and anime include &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;Kino&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.

Modern-day western gunslingers have also appeared in recent Neo-Westerns. Raylan Givens from the television series &quot;Justified&quot; shares the same ambiguous moral code of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; shares many elements of a hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.

Gunfighters have also been featured in many video games, both in traditional Old West and in contemporary and future settings. Colton White was the protagonist of 2005&#x27;s best-selling western video game &quot;Gun&quot;. Another well-known video game Western protagonist is John Marston from &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, who was nominated for 2010 Spike&#x27;s Video Game Awards, as well as his friend Arthur Morgan in &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;he and his creators conjure such a convincing, cohesive and enthralling re-imagination of the real world that it sets a new standard for sophistication and ambition in electronic gaming.&quot; The main character Caleb in the video games &quot;Blood&quot; and &quot;Blood II: The Chosen&quot; is also a former Old West gunfighter. Gunfighter is also a callsign for a group of two Apache Helicopters in the video game &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;. They appear on a mission named &quot;Gunfighters&quot;, and the player will act as Captain Brad &quot;Hawk&quot; Hawkins from 1st Aviation Regiment.

Former professional American football quarterback Brett Favre was nicknamed &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; due to his rural, Southern upbringing and his wild, risky, quick-throwing play style that led him to great success in the National Football League.

<text>Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) (LdSH(RC)) is a regular armoured regiment of the Canadian Army and is Canada’s only tank regiment. Currently based in Edmonton, Alberta, the regiment is part of 3rd Canadian Division&#x27;s 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. Members of the regiment are commonly called &quot;Strathconas&quot; or &quot;Strats&quot; as a short form. It was one of the last regiments in the British Empire to be created and raised by a private individual, Donald Alexander Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal.

The regimental motto is &quot;Perseverance&quot;. The colonel-in-chief of the regiment is King Charles III, while the colonel of the regiment is Colonel(Ret’d) Jamie Cade. The current commanding officer is Lieutenant-Colonel D. Gray, and the regimental sergeant major is Chief Warrant Officer N. Mills.

== Regimental structure ==

The regiment is composed of a regimental headquarters (RHQ), three sabre (tank) squadrons (A, B, and C Sqns), and headquarters squadron which provides service support. In September 2006, B Squadron deployed to Afghanistan using the Leopard C2, the first NATO deployment of main battle tanks to Afghanistan.

Each year the squadron that distinguishes itself with the highest efficiency rating in the regiment earns the title &quot;Prince of Wales Squadron&quot; for the year. The regiment has seven affiliated cadet corps in Alberta and British Columbia.

== Role ==

, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse operated with 40 Leopard 2s (20 A4s, 9 A4Ms and 11 2A6Ms) and 12 Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicles. Due to a change in Canadian army doctrine in the early 2000s away from heavy armour to more infantry-centred operations, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse was for several years the only regular armoured regiment to operate MBTs. This was until the 2006 announcement that the Royal Canadian Dragoons would be re-equipped with a squadron of Leopards.

== Heraldry ==
Blazon: &quot;Lord Strathcona&#x27;s coat of arms, without supporters, being a shield surmounted by a maple tree inclined to the left, and cut through by a beaver working at the base; in the chief a demi-lion rampant; in the centre a railroad spike and hammer crossed; in the base a canoe bearing a flag inscribed &quot;NW&quot; and containing four men; the whole surrounded by a riband which is encircled by a wreath of roses, thistles, shamrocks and maple leaves, and inscribed &quot;Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse Royal Canadians&quot;, surmounted by a scroll bearing the motto &quot;perseverance&quot;, and the whole surmounted by the Crown&quot;.

This badge commemorates Lord Strathcona&#x27;s role in the fur trade and in the settlement of North West Canada (as the province of Alberta was called prior to 1905) by its representation of a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trade canoe, the flag &#x27;NW&#x27; (for &quot;North West&quot;), and the representation of the railway construction tools. The latter mark Lord Strathcona&#x27;s direct role in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The uniform shoulder titles are &quot;STRATHCONA&#x27;S&#x27;&quot; (brass DEU); &quot;LdSH(RC)&quot; (CADPAT)

==History==

=== Strathcona&#x27;s Horse and The Boer War ===
Strathcona&#x27;s Horse was authorized on 1 February 1900 and embarked for Africa on 17 March 1900. There it fought as part of the 3rd Mounted Brigade and 4th Infantry Brigade, II Division, until its departure from the theatre of operations on 20 January 1901. The unit disbanded on 9 March 1901.

The regiment was one of the last in the British Empire to be created and raised by a private individual, Donald Alexander Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal. During the Boer War, Lord Strathcona recruited and equipped the cavalry regiment at his own expense for service in South Africa. Many skilled horsemen (cowboys and North-West Mounted Police members) enlisted, allowing for a short training period and rapid deployment to Africa. The 537 officers and men, as well as 599 horses, of the new regiment sailed from Halifax on 18 March 1900 and arrived in Cape Town on 10 April. Along with The Royal Canadian Dragoons, the regiment won renown for their scouting skills.Rumour exists that members of the North-West Mounted Police serving with the regiment during the Boer War preferred the boots the regiment wore, and adopted them as their own – hence the name &quot;Strathcona boots&quot; for Royal Canadian Mounted Police high brown boots.

Another legacy of the official kit is the huge popularity of the distinctive Stetson Campaign Hat worn by all Canadians serving in Africa during the Second Boer War. After seeing Canadian troops in this attire at the Relief of Mafeking, British Officer Robert Baden-Powell ordered 10,000 of the hats for his own troops.

Supposedly General Kitchener was astonished at the size of the newly arrived Canadian soldiers. Their commander, Sam Steele, is said to have replied &quot;My apologies, sir. I combed all of Canada and these are the smallest I could find.&quot;

=== Early 1900s ===
After the war, the regiment boarded ship at Cape Town on 20 January 1901 and arrived in London on 14 February. Here they met Lord Strathcona for the first time and were presented their medals by King Edward VII personally. On its return to Canada on 9 March 1901, the regiment was disbanded. The name &quot;Strathcona&#x27;s Horse&quot; was revived in 1909 when the Royal Canadian Mounted Rifles (which had been created in the Permanent Force in 1901) was renamed &quot;Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)&quot;. The word &quot;Lord&quot; was prepended to the regimental title in 1911.

=== First World War ===
The regiment was placed on active service at the start of the Great War on 6 August 1914 for instructional and camp administration duties. On 14 September 1914 the regiment mobilized Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians), CEF, which embarked for England on 3 October 1914. On 5 May 1915 it disembarked in France, where it fought dismounted in an infantry role with Seeley&#x27;s Detachment (really the Canadian Cavalry Brigade, part of the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division), 1st Canadian Division. On 27 January 1916, the regiment remounted and resumed its cavalry role as part of the 1st Canadian Cavalry Brigade, with whom it continued to fight in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The overseas regiment disbanded on 6 November 1920.

At the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment was mobilised and began its training in England. In 1915, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse served as infantry in the trenches in France. On 16 February 1916, the Strathcona&#x27;s were reconstituted as a mounted force and, as an Imperial Service Regiment, served in the Canadian Cavalry Brigade attached to the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division, which in November 1916 became the 5th Cavalry Division of the British 4th Army. In March 1917, the regiment saw action as cavalry during the defence of the Somme front. It was during this fighting that Lieutenant Frederick Harvey won the Victoria Cross for rushing a German machine gun post and capturing the gun position. In spring 1918 during the last great German offensive, called by the Germans Operation Michael, when the Imperial and French armies were on the verge of being split, the regiment earned its third Victoria Cross.

On 31 March 1918, in what is known as &quot;the last great cavalry charge&quot; at the Battle of Moreuil Wood, Lieutenant Gordon Flowerdew was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for leading the charge in a successful engagement with entrenched German forces. Nearly three-quarters of the Canadian cavalry involved in the attack against German machine-gun positions were killed or wounded. Unable to break the trench deadlock and of little use at the front, cavalry remained behind the lines for much of the war. During the German offensives of March and April 1918, however, the cavalry played an essential role in the open warfare that temporarily confronted the retreating British forces.
=== Second World War ===
On 24 May 1940, Regimental Headquarters and one squadron were mobilized together with the Regimental Headquarters and one squadron of The Royal Canadian Dragoons to form the 1st Canadian Motorcycle Regiment, CASF (RCD/LSH(RC)). It was redesignated as Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians), CASF, on 21 September 1940; as the 2nd Armoured Regiment (Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)), CASF, on 11 February 1941; as the 2nd Armoured Regiment (Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)), CAC, CASF, on 15 October 1943; and as the 2nd Armoured Regiment (Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)), RCAC, CASF, on 2 August 1945. The regiment embarked for Britain on 13 November 1941 and landed in Italy on 8 November 1943, where it fought as part of the 5th Armoured Brigade, 5th Canadian Armoured Division. On 16 February 1945 the regiment moved with the I Canadian Corps to North-West Europe as part of Operation Goldflake, where it fought until the end of the war. 

During the Second World War, the regiment mobilised an armoured regiment for overseas service, which joined the First Canadian Armoured Division (renamed the 5th Canadian Armoured Division). During an inspection in England, King George VI noticed that the divisional patches on the sleeves of the troopers bore the legend &quot;LSH&quot;. He remarked to a Strathcona&#x27;s officer that he had always thought the proper abbreviation of &quot;Lord&quot; was &quot;Ld&quot;. The regiment promptly changed its formation patches and have used the correct designation ever since.

One of the many dramatic changes World War I introduced into military organisation and technology was the introduction of the tank, however, Canada would persist with horse cavalry until the Summer of 1940. The regiment did have a Ford and a Chevrolet armoured car, representing 50% of Canada&#x27;s entire armoured strength at the start of the Second World War. In July 1940, LdSH(RC) along with The Royal Canadian Dragoons, were mobilized as the 1st Canadian Motorcycle Regiment. Later that year, the Strathcona&#x27;s became 2nd Armoured Regiment, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians). The Regiment trained in England for two years with Canadian built Ram tanks and saw its first action in an armoured role in Italy.

One of the regiment&#x27;s most noteworthy battles in Italy was the Melfa River Crossing. During this desperate battle the Strathcona RHQ reconnaissance troop established a bridgehead in conjunction with &quot;A&quot; Company, The Westminster Regiment (Motor) on the Melfa River and held it against determined German tank and infantry attacks until reinforcements could arrive. The action resulted in a Victoria Cross being awarded to the OC &quot;A&quot; Company, Major Jack Mahony and forged a long-standing association between the two regiments.

The advance up the boot of Italy bloodied the regiment but also forged their identity as a Canadian tank unit, second to none. The regiment left Italy in February 1945, and fought in the North West Europe campaign to liberate the Netherlands and the Lowlands. In 1946, the regiment returned to Canada and except for two operational tours in Germany, called Calgary its home garrison.

The overseas regiment was disbanded on 1 March 1946.

On 1 September 1945 a second Active Force component of the regiment was mobilized for service in the Pacific theatre of operations designated as the 2nd–2nd Armoured Car Regiment (Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)), RCAC, CASF. It was redesignated as the 2nd Armoured Regiment (Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)), RCAC, CASF) on 1 March 1946 and on 27 June 1946 it was embodied in the Permanent Force.

=== Post war to the present ===
During the Cold War, the regiment was deployed on several rotations to West Germany, and three squadrons fought in rotation in the Korean War as part of the 1st Commonwealth Division. Originally intended to be equipped with M-10 tank destroyers, the Strathconas in Korea went into action with M4A3E8 Sherman tanks. A, B and C Squadrons fought independently in Korea from 19 April 1951 to 27 July 1953 as part of the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade Group, 1st Commonwealth Division. The squadrons were equipped with M4A3E8 Sherman tanks.

Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians), along with The Royal Canadian Dragoons, contributed troops to 56 Reconnaissance Squadron for duty with the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) from March 1957 to January 1959, equipped with Ferret armoured cars. The battle captain, Captain Norman A. Shackleton, the 1st Troop leader, Lieutenant CC Van Straubenzee, and the 3rd Troop leader, Lieutenant F.G. Woodrow, as well as half of the NCOs and soldiers were Strathconas. Two members of 56 Reconnaissance Squadron died: Lieutenant Charles C. Van Straubenzee on 10 May 1957 and Trooper George E. McDavid on 29 Nov 1957. Other squadrons of the regiment served there and in Cyprus. Trooper Reginald J. Wiley died on UN duty in the Sinai on 7 September 1961. The Strathconas&#x27; last deployment to Cyprus took place from August 1988 to March 1989.

The regiment served two tours of duty in Germany as part of Canada&#x27;s contribution to NATO, equipped with Centurion tanks.

During the 1990s, the regiment deployed to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia twice as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and once as part of NATO&#x27;s Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (SFOR), largely equipped with the AVGP Cougar armoured car.

Other deployments include two six-month missions in Bosnia: 1994 with the United Nations and 1997 with NATO.

The Strathconas contributed several tank squadrons as well as reconnaissance personnel to the various Canadian task forces that served in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2014. Trooper Michael Yuki Hayakaze was killed in action in Afghanistan on 2 March 2008. In 2002 the Reconnaissance Squadron participated as part of the Canadian battle group during the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan. The squadron returned to Kabul, Afghanistan for a six-month rotation in 2004 as part of Canada&#x27;s ongoing commitment to the International Security Assistance Force. Since September 2006, various squadrons of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) served continuously in Afghanistan, forming the basis of every tank squadron to serve as part of Task Force Kandahar.

In 2000, to commemorate the centenary of its original foundation, a mounted detachment of eighteen members from Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) was invited to London, where, in ceremonial full-dress, they mounted the Queen&#x27;s Life Guard at the Horse Guards on seven days between 8 and 23 September. This was a very great honour, as they were the first overseas unit to mount the Queen&#x27;s Life Guard at the Horse Guards.

Freedom of the city was exercised by Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) in St. Albert, Alberta, on June 11, 2011. This was followed by the Freedom of the City being offered by Strathcona County in Sherwood Park, Alberta, on August 24, 2013.

===Pipes and Drums===

Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse is one of the few non-Canadian-Scottish regiments to maintain a pipe band. Although the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment (2RCR), maintains the only pipes and drums in the regular army, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse also maintains its own pipes and drums. The difference between the two is that the 2RCR Pipes and Drums is funded directly by the Battalion, while the LdSH (RC) pipes and drums is funded by the regimental society. As such, the Strathcona Pipes and Drums is a voluntary band that consists of both members of the regiment and outside volunteers, all of whom serve in the authorized pipe band of the regiment. The pipes and drums was created in 1980 through the advocacy of Warrant Officer P. Peters, who acted as the unofficial regimental piper. In 1998, when the official Land Force Western Area Band was dissolved, Peters immediately formed a pipe band consisting of seven Strathconas to perform at regimental functions. Its first official appearance was at the Californian home of former Prime Minister of Canada Kim Campbell.

Since then, the pipe band has taken part in regimental events such as military parades and provincial state funerals in Edmonton. In 2000, major international events such as the 100th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother saw the band travel to South Africa, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. A year later, it performed at the celebrations Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in the U.K. In 2008, the operational activities of the regiment in Afghanistan resulted in a decision to cease all activities, an arrangement that lasted until it was reconstituted in 2011.

The following served as drum majors for the band:

*Warrant Officer Brian Talty (1999–2002)
*Warrant Officer K. Hepburn (2002–2004) 
*Warrant Officer R. Stacey (2004–2005) 
*Warrant Officer J. Hapgood (2005–2007) 
*Warrant Officer A. Batty (2007–2008) 
*Sergeant Patrick Stoyko (2013–2014)

The following served as pipe majors for the band:

*Warrant Officer Paul Peters (1998–2001)
*Master Corporal Al MacNeill (2001–2002)
*Master Corporal Marvin MacNeill (2002–2008)
*Warrant Officer Marvin MacNeill (2011–2013)
*Warrant Officer Cordell Boland (2013–present)

Despite the cavalry traditions of the regiment, the pipes and drums does not perform in full dress uniform due to concerns of a confusion with the Strathcona Mounted Troop. In light of this, the regiment authorized a hybrid uniform custom designed for the band. The band uniform consists of a midnight blue patrol jacket, kilts (in the pattern if the official MacKenzie tartan) and a sporran that is similar to that of the Pipes and Drums of the Royal Tank Regiment.

=== Predecessors ===
One of the predecessors of the pipe band was the regimental brass and reed military band consisting of approximately 50 to 70 professional musicians during its 12-year existence from 1956 to 1968. The band was one of seventeen joint-service bands to take part in the 1967 Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo celebrating the Canadian Centennial of that year. Allan Rae, a Canadian composer who was known most notably for being a former board member of the Canadian League of Composers, was a member of the band in the 70s. Derek Stannard, who later became the director of the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces, also was a member of this band. In the wake of its disbandment, a voluntary drum and bugle corps was established by Warrant Officer Mucker Langan in 1971, whose volunteers primary duties were with the regiment&#x27;s Assault Troop. Both of these bands performed in the regimental full dress uniform, all of which were transferred to the Ceremonial Mounted Troop in 1974.

==Regimental Museum and Archives==
The Regimental Museum and Archives are at The Military Museums in Calgary, Alberta. The museum has a static gallery of that tells the history of the regiment from 1900 to present, with a rotating selection of special exhibits and displays. The regimental collection holds thousands of artifacts and relics, while the archives has photographs, records, documents and diaries with which it conducts research for personal and professional institutions around the world. The museum is staffed by full-time Regular Force soldiers, a captain, a sergeant and a corporal, with additional volunteers assisting in research, outreach and design.

On average, the museum hosts approximately 40,000 visitors annually and educates the public with stories of cavalry history and traditions from Western Canada&#x27;s only Regular Force armoured unit. The LdSH(RC) Museum and Archives are mandated to assist the public-at-large with research on their family connections to the regiment as well as to perform educational outreach to the regiment, its members and the city of Calgary. Participating in displays at Spruce Meadows, Canada Day and the Calgary Stampede, members from the LdSH(RC) Museum are familiar sight around Calgary and they aim to educate, train and inform the public about the history of the regiment.

==Cadets==
There are several Royal Canadian Army Cadets units spread across Alberta, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories which are affiliated to the Lord Strachcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians). Cadets are not soldiers; they are part of an organization dedicated to developing citizenship and leadership among young men and women aged 12 to 18 years of age with a military flavour, and are not required to join the Canadian Forces.

Cadet units affiliated to the LdSH(RC) receive support and also are entitled to wear traditional regimental accoutrements on their uniforms.

<text>The Ume River (Swedish: &quot;Ume älv&quot; or &quot;Umeälven&quot;) is one of the main rivers in northern Sweden. It is around long, and flows in a south-eastern direction from its source, the lake &quot;Överuman&quot; by the Norwegian border within the Scandinavian mountain range. For large parts, the European route E12, also known as Blå Vägen (Blue Route), follows its path.

The river passes through Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve and Lake Storuman and drains into the Gulf of Bothnia on Sweden&#x27;s east coast at the small town of Holmsund, and adjacent to the city of Umeå. Its chief tributary is the Vindel River, which is the biggest tributary river in Sweden. The Ume and Vindel rivers meet at the village of Vännas.

At the mouth of the river, where it meets the Gulf of Bothnia, lies Obbolaön (Obbola Island). The island divides the river into two streams just as it runs out into the sea.

==Early history==

People have lived in the Ume river valley for at least five thousand years. At Norrforsen, the site of large rapids along the river, there are petroglyphs from about 3,000 BCE. The rock carvings are from hunter-gatherer culture, and depict mainly elk (forty figures), some boats (ten figures) and one human being, along with some unidentified fragment carvings. Along with hunting, fishing has been an important activity for the inhabitants of the Ume river valley since pre-historic times.

==Fishing==

A number of fish species, notably salmon, live in the Ume river and its tributaries. Ume River and its main tributary, the Vindel River, are crucial habitat for the salmon population of the Baltic Sea. Early settlements were built along the river in the 1200–1300s, to be near the source of salmon. During the early 1700s, local people began to build salmon traps in the river rapids, but spring floods were a danger to the fishing huts and boats. Fishing continued to be an important industry through the 19th century.

Salmon populations continue to be important both ecologically and as a source of economic activity. In the main channel of the Ume River before the hydropower era, salmon could migrate up to Fällforsen, a little over a mile upstream of the town of Vännäs. In the Vindel River, the salmon could go considerably further, at least to Vindelgransele, but sometimes all the way up to Stensundsforsen at Sorsele. With the construction of the power station in Stornorrfors, the salmon migration into the Vindel River would have been closed if it weren&#x27;t for the salmon ladder constructed there. With it, the salmon can still make it to spawning grounds, mainly in the upper Vindel River, where nearly half of all smolts that reach the Baltic Sea are born. In addition, since 1959 there has been a compensatory fish farm in Norrfors, from which more than 100,000 fish fry are released annually.

==Industries==
===Timber industry===

At the beginning of the 19th century, the timber industry began to grow along the Ume River. The original sawmill at Baggböle Rapids, built in 1813-14, stemmed from a partnership between Johan Unander, Eric Nyberg and Johan Vikner, who obtained permission to build there. Development of the industry around Baggböle continued with the arrival of Scottish-Swedish brothers James and Robert Dickson in the 1830s, as a timber market emerged in Great Britain. The Dicksons had built a timber business in the Värmland province but in the 1820s they constructed two large water-powered sawmills. The sawmill at Baggböle was the largest in Sweden powered by water. So infamous were their methods that a new word in Swedish was derived from the name of &quot;Baggböle&quot;. The Swedish word &quot;baggböleri&quot; is a pejorative term for reckless deforestation. The sawmills worked from May to October each year employing 170 workers, excluding women and children.

The water-powered sawmill was under threat when steam power was introduced further south at Tunadal in Sweden in 1849. Twenty more steam-powered Swedish saw mills began operating within a decade. These sawmills were usually located near ports, and the earlier saw mills situated near water power were closed. The water-powered saw mill on the Ume River was one of the last to close in 1884, when a steam-powered mill was erected in Holmsund at the mouth of the river.

===Hydroelectricity===


A hydroelectric power plant was built to replace a steam power plant providing electricity to the city of Umeå in 1899, Klabböle Kraftverk, on the south bank of the river. The plant delivered electricity to Umeå for the first time on December 6, 1899, but problems arose due to its location along the river, where supercooling produces ice slush. The plant nevertheless supplied electricity until 1958, when it was replaced by the newly constructed state-owned power plant at Norrforsen. 

An expansion site, constructed on the former Baggböle sawmill site in 1914, was eventually sold to the city of Umeå in 1947 and the land is a park and arboretum called Arboretum Norr. The former plant Klabböle Kraftverk is now a museum. 

In the 1950s, hydroelectricity development required building reservoirs and dams throughout Sweden, but concerns were being raised about the environmental impact of these power plants. In particular, there were heated discussions about the developments on the Ume River and Vindel River. This eventually led in 1961 to an agreement called the Peace of Sarek (), which prevented development on some rivers of the Vindel River and in exchange gave freedom to develop the other rivers, including the Ume River. 

The Ume River has since been extensively cultivated for hydroelectric power. There are now thirteen power stations on the river, all but two having been established in the late 1950s to late 1960s. The power station at Stornorrfors generates more electricity annually than any other hydroelectric power plant in Sweden, incorporating five turbines. It is second largest in terms of power output after the Hårsprånget power station on the Lule River, further north.

== Places named after Ume River ==

In Schiedam in the Netherlands, Swedish-like houses are built and one of the streets, the Umefors, is named after this river.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation was a socialist political party in the United Kingdom, led by Sylvia Pankhurst. Under many different names, it gradually broadened its politics from a focus on women&#x27;s suffrage to eventually become a left communist grouping.

==East London Federation of the WSPU==
It originated as the East London Federation of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU, better known as the Suffragettes). The East London Federation was founded by Dr Richard Pankhurst and his wife Emmeline Pankhurst in 1893, and differed from its parent organisation in being democratic and including men, such as George Lansbury.

By this point, Sylvia had many disagreements with the route the WSPU was taking. She wanted an explicitly socialist organisation tackling wider issues than women&#x27;s suffrage, aligned with the Independent Labour Party, based among working class people in the East End of London. She also wanted to focus on collective workers&#x27; action, not individual attacks on property.

==East London Federation of Suffragettes==
These and other differences, including personal ones, led to Sylvia&#x27;s expulsion, along with the East London Federation, from the WSPU. In early 1914, they renamed themselves the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS) and launched a newspaper, the &quot;Women&#x27;s Dreadnought&quot;. Members included Aethel Tollemache.

At first, the group campaigned for universal suffrage and agitated among parliamentarians, with the assistance of Keir Hardie. But with the outbreak of World War I, they began also to attack participation in the war, supporting the positions of the Zimmerwald Conference. This view initially lost the group support, but they began work to ameliorate suffering in the East End.

The ELFS got a chain of cost price restaurants set up, and itself set up a toy factory, free clinic and Montessori nursery. They also agitated for widow&#x27;s pensions and dependent&#x27;s allowances.

==Workers&#x27; Suffrage Federation==
As public opinion turned against the war, the group gained new support, and its newspaper increased its circulation. To reflect its now broader political positions, in March 1916 it renamed itself the Workers&#x27; Suffrage Federation (WSF). Similarly, in July 1917, the newspaper was renamed the &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;. From the start of 1917, it adopted a new aim: &quot;to secure Human Suffrage, namely, a Vote, for every Woman and Man of full age, and to win Social and Economic Freedom for the People&quot;.

The WSF supported the 1916 Irish Rising and became a leading proponent of improved social welfare while continuing agitation for a universal franchise. As such, it opposed the Franchise Bill which ultimately gave women in Britain the vote in general elections as the restrictions on women voting were much stricter than those on men.

Despite its evolving position, during much of 1917, the party remained focused on campaigning for universal suffrage and an end to World War I. It welcomed the February Revolution in Russia, largely on the basis that it would establish a Constituent Assembly elected by universal suffrage and withdraw Russia from the war. As the months went by, the WSF noted in &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; that a situation of dual power had broken out between the Petrograd Soviet and the Russian Provisional Government, and upon analyzing the attitudes of the various socialist faction, decided to align with the Bolsheviks.

The party then enthusiastically supported the October Revolution of 1917, which acted as a catalyst that changed their position from supporting universal suffrage towards anti-parliamentarism. When, in January 1918, the new Bolshevik government in Russia dissolved the Assembly, the group now welcomed its replacement by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets and now argued that Soviets were the most democratic form of government. The WSF also looked forward to the Russian withdrawal from the war, welcoming the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a step towards peace. During this period, the WSF led campaigns against the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, with the slogan &quot;Hands off Russia&quot;. The WSF demanded that the British government negotiate peace with Soviet Russia, urged the labour movement to take action in support of the Soviet government, and eventually called on workers&#x27; to launch a general strike that would force an end to the intervention. In the April 1918 issue of &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;, Pankhurst argued that the most effective way to aid the Soviet government in Russia would be to establish workers&#x27; councils in Britain, and later insisted that a world revolution would be needed to overthrow global capitalism in order for the Russian Revolution to survive.

==Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation==
The WSF&#x27;s support for the soviet system led them to doubt the possibility of establishing socialism through a parliamentary system, increasingly arguing that only the Soviets could form the &quot;guiding and co-ordinating machinery&quot; of the social revolution. In May 1918, the party&#x27;s conference agreed to again rename the group, now as the Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation, reflecting its growing opposition to Parliamentarism. However, their views on parliamentarism remained in a state of transition, with substantial internal disagreement on the issue. As preparation for the 1918 United Kingdom general election was underway, the WSF stated that it would not stand candidates in the election, Pankhurst herself refusing to stand for the Sheffield Hallam constituency, but it remained willing to support other socialist candidates for Parliament. The group went on to support the Socialist Labour Party&#x27;s (SLP) three candidates in the election, along with independent socialists David Kirkwood and John Maclean, and permitted individual members to campaign for Labour Party candidates.

By March 1919, the WSF had moved to a hardline anti-parliamentary position, with Pankhurst arguing socialists needed to choose between &quot;perpetuating the Parliamentary system&quot; or building up &quot;an industrial republic on Soviet lines.&quot; At the party&#x27;s conference in June 1919, it voted to ignore all future elections, and also to follow the advice of the Third International by opening discussions with other socialist groups with the aim of forming a single communist party. As a result, it organised meetings in London later in the month, which were attended both by anti-parliamentarists such as the WSF and South Wales Socialist Society (SWSS), as well as by supporters of &quot;Revolutionary Parliamentarism&quot;, including the SLP and British Socialist Party (BSP). Pankhurst wrote to Vladimir Lenin in July 1919, asking for his support for the party&#x27;s opposition to standing in elections; but to her disappointment, he argued that renouncing parliamentary action would be a mistake. While not changing its views, the WSF accordingly deprioritised this policy in the hope of furthering the unity negotiations, a decision criticised by Rose Witcop of the Communist League.

It also began working with the London Workers&#x27; Committee.

Alongside the question of parliamentary action, the issue of affiliation to the Labour Party provided another roadblock to the unity negotiations. In March 1920, the WSF&#x27;s executive committee declared that &quot;if the BSP refuses to withdraw from the Labour Party, we get on with [the] formation of [a] Communist Party.&quot; By June 1920, it had become apparent that the unity negotiations would not satisfy all the participants, as they were unable to agree either on the issues of parliamentary action or whether the new communist party should attempt to affiliate to the Labour Party. In an attempt to get ahead of the Communist Unity Convention, which they believed would be dominated by those on the &quot;right-wing&quot; that favored parliamentarism and affiliation, the WSF instead called an &quot;Emergency Conference&quot;, inviting all the &quot;left-wing communists&quot; which opposed parliamentarism and affiliation.

==Communist Party (British Section of the Third International)==

The conference was held in June 1920 but was attended only by WSF members, some local groups and independents. It agreed to form the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) (CP(BSTI)) and voted to boycott future unity meetings. Instead, it attempted to interest the SLP in a merger. They proposed opening discussions with the Socialist Party of Great Britain and the British Section of the International Socialist Labour Party, but then withdrew, leaving the exercise a failure. However, the CP(BSTI) did gain influence in the Scottish Communist Labour Party and the tiny Communist Party of South Wales and the West of England was formed on their platform.

The BSP had meanwhile formed the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Lenin called on other communists to join the new party, and the CP(BSTI) was one of the groups covered in his work &quot;Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot;. Although &quot;Workers Dreadnaught&quot; was openly critical of this pamphlet, Pankhurst attended the Second Congress of the Comintern, where Lenin personally persuaded Sylvia that her objections were less important than unity, and that it would be possible to maintain an anti-Parliamentary opposition within the CPGB. Pankhurst called a conference, inviting the English Shop Stewards&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Committee Movement, the Communist Labour Party, the Scottish Workers&#x27; Committee and the Glasgow Communist Group. She was arrested in September, but with the support of Willie Gallacher, all the groups at the conference bar Guy Aldred&#x27;s Glasgow Communist Group agreed to merge with the Communist Party of Great Britain in January 1921.

After a period, Pankhurst was instructed to place the &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; under the control of the party, which she refused to do. In particular, she criticised the Communist Party members of the Poplar Board of Guardians for agreeing to reduce outdoor Poor Law relief, which was cited as the reason for her expulsion from the CPGB in September 1921. While the idea of democratic centralism, newly accepted as the governing principle for the CPGB, would seem to suggest that she was in breach of discipline, &quot;Labour Monthly&quot; continued as the personal organ of R. P. Dutt and even received subsidies.

==Communist Workers&#x27; Party==

Pankhurst reorganised her group of supporters around &quot;Workers Dreadnought&quot;, and began criticising the admittance of trade unions to the Red International of Labour Unions, and warning that they felt the Bolsheviks were beginning to &quot;slip to the right&quot;. The decline in class conflict that culminated in the dissolution of the Shop Stewards Movement had reignited debates over trade unionism within the British socialist movement, which split into two camps: the &quot;Amalgamationists&quot; that advocated the amalgamation of existing trade unions into industrial unions and &quot;Dual Unionists&quot; that advocated for building new industrial unions from scratch. Where trade unionists aligned with the CPGB largely pursued amalgamation, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; group had moved away from that position towards dual unionism, with Pankhurst writing in an August 1921 article that workers needed to unite into One Big Union capable of abolishing capitalism. Pankhurst criticised the attempts to reform existing trade unions from within, drawing parallels between the amalgamationists&#x27; tactic of trying to change union leadership from within and earlier socialist experiences with electoralism, arguing that institutional trade unionism needed to be abolished entirely and replaced with industrial unionism. 

The &quot;Dreadnought&quot; group advocated grouping together Industrial Unions under the auspices of the &quot;All-Workers Revolutionary Union&quot;: intended as &quot;One Big Union&quot; which would unite all workers in a struggle against capitalism. In February 1922, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; group established the Communist Workers&#x27; Party (CWP), with this newly-adopted industrial unionist policy as its foundation. In the party&#x27;s programme, it stated its aim as such: 

The CWP had been influenced by the formation of the General Workers&#x27; Union of Germany (AAUD) by the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (KAPD) during the German Revolution. They intended as such to establish a British counterpart to the AAUD, just as the CWP was intended as the British counterpart to the KAPD. Taking the AAUd&#x27;s programme as a basis, in September 1922 the CWP established the All-Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Union (AWRU) in order to implement its revolutionary unionist goals, envisioning the AWRU as the One Big Union that would itself manage the transition to socialism. The union organized itself along industrial unionist lines, where recallable delegates were elected by workshops, factories, districts, areas and national councils from the bottom-up. The CWP was quickly rendered redundant and was subsequently superseded by the AWRU, as the AWRU adopted the CWP&#x27;s entire programme as its own and developed it into an even more comprehensive one than the CWP&#x27;s, with membership of the AWRU being accepted only on the condition of adhering to all six points of the CWP platform: 
#to spread communist ideas; 
#electoral abstention and anti-parliamentary propaganda; 
#refusal of affiliation to the Labour Party or any other reformist organisation; 
#to emancipate workers from the existing trade unions;
#to organise &#x27;One Revolutionary Union&#x27; as the forerunner of the workers&#x27; councils; 
#and affiliation to the Communist Workers International (KAI).

The foundation of the AWRU was grounded in the CWP&#x27;s prefigurative politics, as the AWRU was intended to itself organise the workers&#x27; councils which would then seize the means of production and form the basis of a council communist society, with the CWP even claiming in 1923 that &quot;Communism and the All-Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Union are synonymous.&quot; This model stood in contrast to how the Soviets of the Russian Revolution and the workers&#x27; councils of the German Revolution had formed, largely spontaneously without their development by pre-existing organisations, but in Britain this kind of organising was no longer possible since the decline of the strike movement. However the model of dual unionism never bore fruit in Britain either, as its material circumstances were far different from that of the United States, where the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) had seen success. The lack of reception to dual unionism meant that the organisation of the AWRU existed largely within the CWP&#x27;s literature in &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;. When the AWRU announced its campaign to build the &quot;One Big Union&quot; in July 1923, they also admitted that they had no funds and very few people. Despite optimism concerning a rise in revolutionary sentiment, by the end of 1923 the AWRU had dissolved. 

Despite the failure of the AWRU, by July 1923 the CWP had announced the formation of the Unemployed Workers&#x27; Organisation (UWO), modelled closely on the IWW as an alternative to the CPGB&#x27;s &quot;reformist&quot; National Unemployed Workers&#x27; Movement (NUWM). Initially, this attracted numerous former members of the NUWM, sometimes even whole branches throughout London. By the start of 1924, it claimed 3,000 members, mostly in London but also with a branch in Leeds. The organisation grew rapidly, which ended up becoming counterintuitive to the UWO&#x27;s aims of organising an &quot;army of production&quot;, given its members were made up of the unemployed. 

In the end, no national group was formally constituted, and they later referred to their network as the Communist Workers Group, although it was by that point a very small party. On 14 June 1924, &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; ceased publication, bringing a definitive end to the CWP.

<text>&quot;The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage&quot; was the solution to a challenge ciphertext posed by the inventors of the RSA cipher in 1977. The problem appeared in Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Games column&quot; in the August 1977 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;. It was solved in 1993–94 by a large, joint computer project co-ordinated by Derek Atkins, Michael Graff, Arjen Lenstra and Paul Leyland. More than 600 volunteers contributed CPU time from about 1,600 machines (two of which were fax machines) over six months. The coordination was done via the Internet and was one of the first such projects.

&quot;Ossifrage&quot; (&#x27;bone-breaker&#x27;, from Latin) is an older name for the bearded vulture, a scavenger famous for dropping animal bones and live tortoises on top of rocks to crack them open. The 1993–94 effort began the tradition of using the words &quot;squeamish ossifrage&quot; in cryptanalytic challenges.

The difficulty of breaking the RSA cipher—recovering a plaintext message given a ciphertext and the public key—is connected to the difficulty of factoring large numbers. While it is not known whether the two problems are mathematically equivalent, factoring is currently the only publicly known method of directly breaking RSA. The decryption of the 1977 ciphertext involved the factoring of a 129-digit (426 bit) number, RSA-129, in order to recover the plaintext.

Ron Rivest estimated in 1977 that factoring a 125-digit semiprime would require 40 quadrillion years, using the best algorithm known and the fastest computers of the day. In their original paper they recommended using 200-digit (663 bit) primes to provide a margin of safety against future developments, though it may have only delayed the solution as a 200-digit semiprime was factored in 2005. However, efficient factoring algorithms had not been studied much at the time, and a lot of progress was made in the following decades. Atkins et al. used the quadratic sieve algorithm invented by Carl Pomerance in 1981. While the asymptotically faster number field sieve had just been invented, it was not clear at the time that it would be better than the quadratic sieve for 129-digit numbers. The memory requirements of the newer algorithm were also a concern.

There was a US$100 prize associated with the challenge, which the winners donated to the Free Software Foundation.

In 2015, the same RSA-129 number was factored in about one day, with the CADO-NFS open source implementation of number field sieve, using a commercial cloud computing service for about $30.

<text>The Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) was a Left Communist organisation established at an emergency conference held on 19–20 June 1920 at the International Socialist Club in London. It comprised about 600 people.

==History==
The emergency conference was called in preparation for the Communist Unity Convention scheduled for 1 August 1920 in London. Here binding decisions were to be made by majority vote, and the Left Communists wanted to organise themselves against the right at this conference. The initial call was sent out by the Workers Socialist Federation (WSF) and attracted communist groups from Aberdeen, Croydon and Holt, the Gorton Socialist Society, the Manchester Soviet, the Stepney Communist League and the Labour Abstentionist Party. E. T. Whitehead, of the Labour Abstentionist Party, became the secretary, and T. J. Watkins was elected as treasurer. &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;, the WSF newspaper edited by Sylvia Pankhurst, was adopted as the official weekly organ of the party, and a provisional Organising Council of 25 members was elected to manage the affairs of the organisation pending a National Conference scheduled for September 1920.

Despite Whitehead&#x27;s assurances that the CP (BSTI) was against parliamentary action and would only consider running candidates for elections on a platform of abstentionism, a dispute broke out with Guy Aldred and the Glasgow Communist Group, who had suspended their support for the Third International on account of their avowed revolutionary parliamentarianism. The question of affiliation with the Labour Party also became an issue, as the CP (BSTI) had proclaimed non-affiliation to be a &quot;cardinal principles&quot;, with articles in &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; arguing against affiliation on a number of different points. 

By the summer of 1920, the British communist press published translated extracts from Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s new pamphlet &quot;Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot;, which attacked British anti-parliamentarists and obliged participation in parliament as the basis for communist unity in the country. Lenin also wrote to the Communist Unity Convention urging the adoption of &quot;revolutionary parliamentarism&quot; as a tactic, something which was agreed by 189 votes to 19, becoming a founding principle of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The CP (BSTI) had also urged the Convention to reject affiliation to the Labour Party in an open letter, but Lenin&#x27;s criticisms of them and advocacy of affiliation led the Convention to agree to affiliation, albeit at a slim margin: 100 votes in favour, 85 against and 20 abstentions. But this policy proved fruitless, as the Labour Party ended up rejecting the CPGB&#x27;s request to affiliate with them on every attempt, which eased relations between the CPGB and CP (BSTI).
This differences in the policy of the CP (BSTI) and the International came to a head when the British section sent delegates to the International&#x27;s Second World Congress. Delegates from the British Socialist Party (BSP) argued in favour of parliamentarism and affiliation to the Labour Party, securing Lenin&#x27;s support and a resolution that adopted both as policy, despite the objections of Pankhurst. The CP (BSTI) were subsequently instructed to unite with the CPGB. Upon their return a further conference was held in Manchester on 18–19 September, where they voted to accept the conditions of the Second World Congress with explicit reservations about taking parliamentary action. Pankhurst argued that the tactic of revolutionary parliamentarianism would likely be dropped at the next congress, due to her impression of the size of the abstentionist faction at the second congress, also reporting that Lenin had said the issue was not important during an informal discussion.

At the third conference of the CP (BSTI) in Cardiff on 4 December, the &quot;Statutes and Theses of the Third International&quot; were accepted, although there was a consensus that they were not to be bound to parliamentary action. The four Manchester branches saw this as a &quot;sell out&quot;, and resigned, taking 200 members with them. Whitehead and Pankhurst maintained they still had the freedom to fight for abstentionism within the CPGB, and they formally fused with them at the second Communist Unity Convention in Leeds, in January 1921. The Glasgow Communist Group responded by inaugurating their newspaper the &quot;Red Commune&quot;, declaring &quot;there is no other party organ in this country [...] that stands fearlessly for Communism. They all urge or compromise with, in some shape or form, parliamentarianism&quot;. At Easter that year they established the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation.

Despite the merger, the former CP (BSTI) maintained &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; as an independent publication from which they could criticise the CPGB on the issues of parliamentary action, as well as its attempted affiliation to the Labour Party. This proved ill-advised, as in September 1921, Sylvia Pankhurst and many of her associates were expelled from the CPGB for the criticisms published in the paper.

==Programme==
In addition to anti-parliamentarism and opposition to affiliation with the Labour Party, the CP (BSTI) argued against establishment trade unions due to the professionalisation of union officials, which they argued put the officials in a privileged position. Despite this position, they argued in favour of CP (BSTI) members working within existing trade unions, in order to &quot;stimulate the growth of rank and file organisation&quot; and &quot;undermine the influence of reactionary Trade Union leaders over the rank and file&quot;. In an internal circular, the party expressed a desire to recruit members from the trade unions so that it could extend its influence throughout them. It thus drew a distinction between working within &quot;non-party mass organisations&quot; and affiliation with &quot;party organisations&quot; such as the Labour Party, calling for the maximum possible participation of its members within trade union organisations, so long as it did not come into conflict with their &quot;communist principles&quot;.

The CP (BSTI) also believed in the necessity of a transitional dictatorship of the proletariat, during which labour would be compulsory, a necessary means for individuals to secure basic necessities. During this transition, Pankhurst argued that wage labour would continue to exist, insisting that society would first need to implement a system of equal wages and equal rationing before abolishing wage labour altogether, though she was unclear on how long this would take or how the transition from the former to the latter would be accomplished. The CP (BSTI)&#x27;s programme further specified that commodity exchange would continue during this transitional period, albeit under state control, with &quot;local and national Soviet banks&quot; issuing currency.

<text>John Travers Cornwell VC (8 January 1900 – 2 June 1916), commonly known as Jack Cornwell or as Boy Cornwell, is remembered for his gallantry at the Battle of Jutland during World War I. Having died at the age of only 16, he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Cornwell is the third-youngest recipient of the VC after Andrew Fitzgibbon and Thomas Flynn (VC).

==Early life==
John &quot;Jack&quot; Travers Cornwell was born as the third child of a working-class family at Clyde Place, Leyton, Essex (now in Greater London). His parents were Eli and Lily Cornwell; he had a sister and three brothers, as well as two half-siblings from his father&#x27;s previous marriage. The family later moved to Alverstone Road, East Ham. He left Walton Road School at the standard age of 14. At the outbreak of the First World War, his father, an ex-soldier, volunteered for service and fought in France. His older brother, Arthur, also served as an infantryman on the Western Front.

In October 1915, Jack Cornwell gave up his job as a delivery boy and enlisted in the Royal Navy without his father&#x27;s permission. He had references from his headmaster and employer. He carried out his basic training at HMS &quot;Vivid&quot; Keyham Naval Barracks in Plymouth, and received further training as a Sight Setter or Gun Layer and became Boy Seaman First Class. On Easter Monday 1916, Cornwell left for Rosyth, Scotland, to join his assignment in the navy. He was assigned to HMS &quot;Chester&quot;.

==Battle of Jutland==

On 31 May 1916, &quot;Chester&quot; was scouting ahead of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland when the ship turned to investigate gunfire in the distance. At 17:30 hours, &quot;Chester&quot; soon came under intense fire from four &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; cruisers each her own size which had suddenly emerged from the haze and increasing funnel smoke of the battlefield. The shielded 5.5-inch gun mounting where Cornwell was serving as a sight-setter was affected by at least four nearby hits. &quot;Chester&quot;″s gun mountings were open-backed shields and did not reach down to the deck. Splinters were thus able to pass under them or enter the open back when shells exploded nearby or behind. All the gun&#x27;s crew were killed or mortally injured except Cornwell, who, although severely wounded, managed to stand up again and remain at his post for more than 15 minutes, until &quot;Chester&quot; retired from the action with only one main battery gun still working. &quot;Chester&quot; had received a total of 18 hits, but partial hull armour meant that the interior of the ship suffered little serious damage and the ship itself was never in peril of sinking. Nevertheless, the situation on deck was dire. Many of the gun crews had lost lower limbs due to splinters passing under the gun shields. British ships reported passing the &quot;Chester&quot; to cheers from limbless wounded gun crew laid out on her deck and smoking cigarettes, only to hear that the same crewmen had died a few hours later from blood loss and shock.

After the action, medics arrived on deck to find Cornwell the sole survivor standing at his gun, shards of steel penetrating his chest, looking at the gun sights and still waiting for orders. Being incapable of further action, &quot;Chester&quot; was ordered to the port of Immingham. There Cornwell was transferred to Grimsby General Hospital, although he was clearly dying. He died shortly before 8:00am on the morning of 2 June 1916, before his mother could arrive at the hospital.

==Victoria Cross==
Three months later, Captain Robert Lawson of &quot;Chester&quot; described the events to the British Admiralty. Though at first reluctant, the Admiralty eventually decided to recommend Cornwell for a posthumous Victoria Cross and King George V endorsed it. The recommendation for citation, from Admiral David Beatty, reads: The instance of devotion to duty by Boy (1st Class) John Travers Cornwell who was mortally wounded early in the action, but nevertheless remained standing alone at a most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders till the end of the action, with the gun&#x27;s crew dead and wounded around him. He was under 16½ years old. I regret that he has since died, but I recommend his case for special recognition in justice to his memory and as an acknowledgement of the high example set by him.

Jack Cornwell was initially buried in a common grave (Square 126 Grave 323) in Manor Park Cemetery, London, although his body was exhumed on 29 July 1916 at which he was reburied with full military honours in the same cemetery (square 55 grave 13). Cornwell&#x27;s father Eli, who died aged 64 on 25 October 1916 from bronchitis during home service with the Royal Defence Corps, was buried in the same grave on 31 October 1916. The epitaph to Jack Cornwell on his grave monument reads, 

In May 2016, the family grave and war memorial, erected in 1920, was given Grade II listed status, legally protecting it from unauthorised modification or removal.

The award of the Victoria Cross appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on Friday 15 September 1916. The citation read: The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of the Victoria Cross to Boy, First Class, John Travers Cornwell, O.N.J.42563 (died 2 June 1916), for the conspicuous act of bravery specified below.

Mortally wounded early in the action, Boy, First Class, Jack Travers Cornwell remained standing alone at a most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders, until the end of the action, with the gun&#x27;s crew dead and wounded all round him. His age was under sixteen and a half years.

On 16 November 1916, Cornwell&#x27;s mother received the Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace. Court painter Frank O. Salisbury made a portrait of Cornwell, using his brother Ernest as a model, depicting him standing in his post. &quot;Boy Cornwell Memorial Fund&quot; was also established. After that, the rest of the family was effectively forgotten. After Eli Cornwell&#x27;s death on 25 October 1916, his half-brother Arthur Frederick Cornwell was killed in action in France on 29 August 1918. The impoverished Alice Cornwell died at the age of 48 on 31 October 1919, at 745 Commercial Road in Stepney, in rooms she was forced to take when her son&#x27;s memorial fund refused financial aid. The two of her children remaining at home were granted £60 a year in a pension from the fund after Alice&#x27;s death, but this proved insufficient and they both emigrated to Canada in the early 1920s. Jack Cornwell&#x27;s elder half-sister, also named Alice, lent Jack&#x27;s Victoria Cross to the Imperial War Museum on 27 November 1968. Salisbury&#x27;s portrait of Cornwell hangs in the Anglican church within the Royal Navy&#x27;s Initial Training Establishment HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot;.

==Remembrance==
The original furore caused by his very public re-burial led to over seven million of the Empire&#x27;s children donating to his fund. £18,000 was raised in his memory for the Jack Cornwell ward of the Royal Star and Garter Home, Richmond. The John Cornwell Victoria Cross National Memorial (JCVCNM) was established in 1928, when a plot of land was purchased at Hornchurch, then in Essex, with money raised by the Mayor of East Ham. There, a community of cottage homes was built for needy, disabled or infirm former sailors and Royal Marines, up to and including the rank of Warrant Officer and their families. The six semi-detached houses and pathways are laid out in the form of a Victoria Cross. Since 2008, the community has been under the trusteeship of The Royal Naval Benevolent Trust.

===Cornwell Scout Badge===

The Boy Scouts Association created an award in his honour, the Cornwell Scout Badge, which is still used by Scout associations throughout the Commonwealth. It is awarded to youth participants in respect of pre-eminently high character and devotion to duty, together with great courage and endurance. Camp Cornwell, established in 1925 as the headquarters for Western Australian Sea Scouts is situated at Pelican Point on the Swan River near Perth.

===Cadets===
Jack Cornwell is also remembered by the Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps, who each have a unit based in the UK&#x27;s first and only Tri-Service Cadet building, named The Cornwell VC Cadet Centre, on Vicarage Lane in East Ham. Newham (Cornwell VC) Sea Cadets have been honoured with &#x27;J T Cornwell VC&#x27; on their cap ribbon (Cap Tally) instead of the customary TS (training ship). They are the only Sea Cadet Unit in the UK to have this honour. In 2003, the Cadets suggested commemorating him by renaming a school in Leyton after him; when Cornwell attended the school it was known as Farmer Road School, and it is now named George Mitchell School, after another former pupil, George Allan Mitchell, who won a VC in Italy during the Second World War. Jack Cornwell is also remembered by Royal Navy Combined Cadet Force divisions, such as the RN CCF section at Whitgift School, Croydon, which is named the &quot;Cornwell&quot; division in his honour.
In Canada, Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps John Travers Cornwell, VC, based at in Winnipeg, MB is named after him.

===Other memorials===
In Little Ilford, Jack Cornwell Street and a nearby block of council flats called John Cornwell VC House are named in his memory. In Jack Cornwell Street there is a public house named The Victoria Cross to commemorate his medal. A blue plaque has been erected by the London Borough of Waltham Forest on the flats that now occupy the site of his birthplace in Clyde Place, Leyton. The 5.5-inch gun on which he served is still displayed in the Imperial War Museum, London. In September 2006, Jack Cornwell VC featured on one of a series of Royal Mail postage stamps marking the 150th anniversary of the Victoria Cross. In 2016, Jack Cornwell was featured on a £5 coin (issued in silver and gold) in a six-coin set commemorating the Centenary of the First World War produced by the Royal Mint. Cornwell Close, on Grimsby&#x27;s Nunsthorpe Estate and Cornwell Court in Haslemere Road, Portsmouth are named after him.

Citadel High School of Halifax, Nova Scotia gives out the Jack Cornwell Award to a student in each graduating class to the student who most exemplifies the qualities of honour, loyalty and bravery.

Mount Cornwell (2,972 metres) is a peak in the High Rock Range in British Columbia, part of the Canadian Rockies, which was named in his honour in 1918. There is also a Mount Chester (3,054 metres) in Alberta, named after HMS &quot;Chester&quot; in 1917.

<doc id="551711" wikidata="Q1870154" url="?curid=551711" title="Ron Dellums">
<text>Ronald Vernie Dellums (November 24, 1935 – July 30, 2018) was an American politician who served as Mayor of Oakland from 2007 to 2011. He had previously served thirteen terms as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California&#x27;s 9th congressional district, in office from 1971 to 1998, after which he worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Dellums was born into a family of labor organizers, and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps before serving on the Berkeley, California, City Council. He was the first African American elected to Congress from Northern California and the first successful openly socialist non-incumbent Congressional candidate after World War II. His politics earned him a place on President Nixon&#x27;s enemies list.

During his career in Congress, he fought the MX Missile project and opposed expansion of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber program. When President Ronald Reagan vetoed Dellums&#x27;s Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate overrode Reagan&#x27;s veto, the first override of a presidential foreign-policy veto in the 20th century.

==Early years and family life==
Dellums was born in Oakland, California, to Verney and Willa (Terry) Dellums. His father was a longshoreman. His uncle, C. L. Dellums, was one of the organizers and leaders of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. He had a younger sister, Theresa. His mother Willa died on August 17, 2008, at the age of 89.

Dellums attended St. Patrick Catholic School, Oakland Technical High School and McClymonds High School. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1954 to 1956. Dellums later received his A.A. degree from the Oakland City College, now Merritt College, in 1958, his B.A. from San Francisco State University in 1960, and his M.S.W. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962. He became a psychiatric social worker and political activist in the African-American community beginning in the 1960s. He also taught at San Francisco State University and the University of California, Berkeley.

Dellums was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was also a member of the fraternity&#x27;s World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand the fraternity&#x27;s involvement in politics, and social and current policy to encompass international concerns.

Dellums was married three times. He married his second wife, attorney Leola &quot;Roscoe&quot; Higgs, in 1961. The two divorced in 1998. He married his third wife, Cynthia Lewis, in 2000.

One son, Michael, was convicted of a drug-related homicide in 1979, and remains in prison, being repeatedly denied parole due to bad behavior. Dellums had five other children: anthropologist Rachel R. Chapman, professional actor Erik, author Piper, Brandon and Pam; six grandchildren: Danielle Henderson, Jacob Holmes, Sydney Ross, Dylan Ross, Olivia Dellums, and actress Solea Pfeiffer; and two great-grandchildren: Jared Henderson and Charli Henderson.

==Berkeley City Council==
Dellums was elected to the Berkeley City Council, after prompting from Maudelle Shirek,
and served from 1967 to 1970.

==U.S. Congress==
Dellums was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1970 after being recruited by anti-Vietnam War activists to run against the incumbent, Jeffery Cohelan, a white liberal close to organized labor who had not opposed the war early enough to win reelection in the district. Dellums defeated Cohelan in the Democratic primary and won the general election, serving without interruption for 27 years.

In 1972, Dellums was reelected to Congress, 60 to 38 percent over his Republican opponent, Peter D. Hannaford, an advisor to then Governor Ronald Reagan.

His politics earned him a place on the so-called Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List, where his notation stated Dellums &quot;had extensive EMK-Tunney support in his election bid.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
During his tenure in Congress, Dellums opposed every major American military intervention, except for emergency relief in Somalia in 1992. Dellums also supported the restriction of foreign aid to repressive African governments in Zaire (present-day DRC), Burundi, Liberia and Sudan.

====Anti-apartheid campaign====

In 1972, Dellums began his campaign to end the apartheid policies of South Africa. Fourteen years later, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Dellums&#x27;s anti-apartheid legislation, calling for a trade restriction against South Africa and immediate divestment by American corporations. The bill, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, had broad bipartisan support. It called for sanctions against South Africa and stated preconditions for lifting the sanctions, including the release of all political prisoners. President Reagan called for a policy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; and vetoed the bill; however, his veto was overridden. It was the first override in the 20th century of a presidential foreign policy veto.

Dellums&#x27;s fight against apartheid in South Africa was the subject of a Disney Channel made-for-TV film, &quot;The Color of Friendship&quot;, released in 2000. The role of Congressman Dellums was played in the film by actor Carl Lumbly.

====Cold War conflicts in southern Africa====
As part of the Cold War struggle for influence in southern Africa, the United States joined with the apartheid government of South Africa in support of UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, against the ultimately victorious Angolan forces of the MPLA supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba. Dellums was criticized for his support of Fidel Castro&#x27;s involvement with the MPLA in Angola and was called &quot;the prototype of the Castroite congressman&quot; by the conservative press. He also introduced legislation (which was unsuccessful) in September 1987 to prohibit economic and military assistance to Zaire, citing poor human rights, corruption, and collaboration with South Africa.

====&quot;Dellums v. Bush&quot; (1990)====
In 1990, Dellums and 44 of his congressional colleagues sued then-president President George H. W. Bush in D.C. Federal District Court in 1990, in the case &quot;Dellums v. Bush&quot;, 752 F. Supp. 1141 (1990) attempting to halt a preemptive military buildup in the Middle East in response to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. The plaintiff members of Congress asserted that military action without a declaration of war would be unlawful under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 11 of the United States Constitution. &quot;Dellums v. Bush&quot; is notable in that it is one of only a few cases in which the Federal Courts have considered whether the War Powers Clause of the U.S. Constitution is justiciable in the courts. The Court in &quot;Dellums v. Bush&quot; indicated that, in that instance, it was, but because Congress had not yet acted as a majority, the lawsuit was premature.

====Military budgets and arms control====
Throughout his career Dellums led campaigns against an array of military projects, arguing that the funds would be better spent on peaceful purposes, especially in American cities. Programs he opposed included the Pershing II and MX missiles, and the B-2 bomber (popularly known as the &quot;stealth bomber&quot;). Because of his commitment to the closing of unneeded military bases, Dellums did not oppose the closing of the former Naval Air Station Alameda in his own district.

The B-2 Stealth Bomber is a long-range strategic bomber, that features stealth technology that makes it far less visible to radar. The B-2 was a major technological advance; however, it was designed during the Cold War for military scenarios that some argued were less relevant following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its total program cost was estimated in 1997 at over US$2.2 billion per airplane.

Although Dellums opposed the B-2 project from the start, Congress approved initial funding for production of 135 bombers in 1987. However, with the winding down of the Cold War, total B-2 production was reduced to 21 aircraft in the early 1990s. But in 1997, seven former Secretaries of Defense signed a letter urging Congress to buy more B-2s, citing the difficulty of assembling a similar engineering team in the future should the B-2 project be terminated. Dellums, citing five independent studies consistent with his position, offered an amendment to that year&#x27;s defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers with the existing 21 aircraft. The amendment was narrowly defeated; nonetheless, Congress never approved funding for additional B-2 bombers.

====Vietnam war crimes hearings====
In January 1971, just weeks into his first term, Dellums set up an exhibit of Vietnam war crimes in an annex to his Congressional office, coordinated with the Citizens Commission of Inquiry (CCI). The exhibit featured four large posters depicting atrocities committed by American soldiers, embellished with red paint.

The My Lai massacre was followed shortly thereafter by a series of hearings on war crimes in Vietnam, which began April 25, 1971. Dellums had called for formal investigations into the allegations, but Congress chose not to endorse the proceedings. As such, the hearings were &quot;ad hoc&quot; and only informational in nature. As a condition of room use, press and camera presence were not permitted; however, the proceedings were transcribed. A small number of other anti-Vietnam War congressional representatives also took part in the hearings.

===Integration of gays and lesbians in the military===
In 1993, Dellums was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Though he argued in favor of integration, Dellums was the sole sponsor of H.R. 2401, introduced on June 14, 1993, adding language to the Defense Authorization Act of 1994 to ensure continued support for unit cohesion in the military. Although the bill contained that language, Dellums pointed out that he personally found the language unacceptable, stating in the Congressional Record on August 4, 1993: &quot;The bill also contains at least one policy that, while unacceptable to this Member in substantive terms, is not as retrograde as it might have been: It supports the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the issue of allowing gay and lesbian service members to serve their country.&quot; Remaining in the bill was Title V Section G &quot;[e]xpresses as congressional policy the prohibition against homosexual conduct or activity in the armed forces. Requires separation from the armed forces for such conduct or activity. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the standards for military appointments and enlistments reflect such policy.&quot; Dellums&#x27;s &quot;yes&quot; vote on the bill with the unit cohesion support language was the first time in his 22-year congressional tenure that he voted in favor of any defense spending bill, previously opposing them on economic principles. However, Dellums gave several economic reasons in the Congressional Record for his &quot;yes&quot; vote, on H.R. 2401, including that &quot;It cuts ballistic missile defense to $3 billion—less than one-half the level planned by the Bush administration ...&quot; and: &quot;it devotes a record $11.2 billion to environmental cleanup and improvement, and does so in a way that will stimulate the development of new technologies and new markets for American firms&quot;.

===U.S. House Committee positions===
Dellums served as chairman of the House Committee on the District of Columbia and the House Armed Services Committee.

Dellums also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Select Committee to Investigate the Intelligence Community.

Dellums co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971 and co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991.

===Dellums&#x27;s last Congressional election===

Dellums was reelected 11 times from this Oakland-based district, which changed numbers twice during his tenure–from the 7th (1971–75) to the 8th (1975–93) to the 9th (1993–98). He only dropped below 57 percent of the vote twice, in 1980 and 1982. In his last House election race, in 1996, Dellums bested his opponent, Republican Deborah Wright, by a 77%–18% margin.

In 1997, Dellums announced that he was retiring from Congress in the middle of his term, and his resignation forced a special election for the balance of his term–– which created a series of five special elections in 12 months as various East Bay politicians ran for different political offices.

Dellums&#x27;s successor, Barbara Lee, won the 2000 election by an even larger, 85%–9% margin.

===Congressional tribute===
Upon his resignation, several members of Congress, including Nancy Pelosi, Jane Harman, William Coyne, Nick Rahall, Ike Skelton, Juanita Millender-McDonald, and Tom DeLay gave speeches on the floor of the House in honor of Dellums. Millender-McDonald described Dellums as a &quot;distinguished, principled [and] educated man.&quot; Her tribute went on:

Congressman Ron Dellums is revered on both sides of this aisle because of his integrity and his commitment to progressive ideas. He was always on the cutting edge of the issues. California will miss him in the ninth district, but the State has been enriched by Ron Dellums. While he towers above most of us physically, this attribute is matched by his intellect, faith in the process and optimism for peaceful resolution of conflict.
Congressman Danny Davis of Illinois described Dellums:
A creative, piercing, probing, incisive, thought-provoking, inspiring, charismatic, careful, considerate and deliberative mind. The mind to stand up when others sit down. The mind to act when others refuse to act. The mind to stand even when you stand alone, battered, bruised and scorned, but still standing. Standing on principle, standing tall and standing for the people.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay described Dellums as &quot;...one of the most giving, open and stalwart, a real stalwart man when he was Chairman&quot;
We are losing one of its finest Members, a Member that I have great respect for, because he always did his homework, was so articulate and eloquent on this floor.
He always got my attention when he stood up and took the microphone. He would stop every Member in their tracks to hear what he had to say, and there are very few Members that have served in this body that can claim the respect that both sides of the aisle had for the gentleman from California.
And the incredible reputation that the gentleman from California has brought to this House; he has elevated this House. He has elevated the distinction of this House by serving here, and this House will greatly miss him when he leaves.
===Voting record===

Dellums&#x27;s voting records in Congress were &quot;almost without exception straight As&quot; from groups such as the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women and the AFL–CIO. He received 100% on consumer group Public Citizen&#x27;s scorecard. In contrast, he received an &quot;F&quot; from NumbersUSA, a group dedicated to limiting immigration.

===Dismissal of drug use allegations===
An eight-month investigation cleared Dellums of allegations that he had used cocaine and marijuana, finding there was no basis for the allegations. The investigation of Dellums and two other congressmen, Texas Democrat Charlie Wilson and California Republican Barry Goldwater Jr., began in 1983, based on a complaint from a House doorkeeper, who pleaded guilty to drug charges on Capitol Hill himself in March 1983.

==Presidential nominations==
In 1976, Dellums was nominated for president by the National Black Political Assembly but refused, stating &quot;It is not my moment; it&#x27;s not my time.&quot; That year, he received 20 delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention for the Vice-Presidency.

Four years later, he was again nominated as the presidential candidate, this time for the Independent Freedom Party, but refused the nomination because the IFP had not yet created an effective political structure. In that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention, Dellums received three delegate votes for the Presidential nomination.

==Lobbyist==
Dellums worked as a legislative lobbyist, which drew criticism described in the &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, a local newspaper. Shortly after leaving office, Dellums began consulting for an international health-care company, Healthcare Management International, which invests in health insurance programs in developing countries.

Dellums worked in Washington, D.C., as a lobbyist for clients such as the East Bay Peralta Community College District and AC Transit, the public transit district charged with offering mass transit throughout the East Bay. Dellums&#x27;s firm lobbied for Rolls-Royce, a company that manufactures aircraft engines. He also worked on behalf of the San Francisco International Airport during its attempts to build additional runway capacity, which has been vigorously opposed by environmental groups. His company was engaged in community relations work for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which conducts scientific research on behalf of the Department of Energy, and has long had a contentious relationship with its residential neighbors and the Berkeley city council. In addition he lobbied for Bristol-Myers Squibb, a multinational pharmaceutical corporation.

In 2017, Bill Browder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that representatives of Vladimir Putin had hired &quot;Howard Schweitzer of Cozen O&#x27;Connor Public Strategies and former Congressman Ronald Dellums to lobby members of Congress on Capitol Hill to repeal the Magnitsky Act and to remove Sergei&#x27;s name from the Global Magnitsky bill.&quot; The bill is named for the Russian lawyer who was murdered in prison for pursuing the corruption of Putin&#x27;s allies. Dellums also worked with the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative to oppose sanctions on Russia.

Dellums lobbied for the Haitian government in 2001–2002 and worked to support Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first democratically elected, former President of Haiti who was deposed in a 2004 coup.

When running for mayor of Oakland, Dellums listed his most recent profession as &quot;retired Congressman&quot; in election filing forms. When assistant City Clerk Marjo Keller informed the Dellums campaign that this description was unacceptable, the campaign elected to leave the occupation field blank.

A former East Bay Express columnist once wrote a column titled &quot;Dellums for Dollars&quot; criticizing Dellums&#x27;s lobbying. Speaking in defense of Dellums, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson said that, if asked, Dellums would likely say &quot;just because I&#x27;m advocating for a company that may be paying me consulting fees, I&#x27;m not selling out my beliefs.&quot;

==Mayor of Oakland==
===2006 Oakland mayoral election===

After Oakland Council President Ignacio De La Fuente and District 3 City Council member Nancy Nadel declared their mayoral candidacies, Dellums was recruited to run for mayor of Oakland. An informal committee, &quot;Draft Dellums&quot;, collected 8,000 signatures and presented them to the former Congressman at a public meeting at Laney College. Crowds of Oaklanders chanted &quot;Run, Ron, Run&quot;.

In October 2005, reportedly after weeks of deliberation and speculation, Dellums announced that he would run for mayor of Oakland. The incumbent mayor, former California Governor Jerry Brown, was prohibited by term limits from running again.

On June 16, 2006, after a careful ballot count, and a dispute over whether votes for unqualified write-in candidates such as George W. Bush and Homer Simpson counted towards the total, Dellums was unofficially declared the winner in the Oakland mayoral race. Dellums garnered a 50.18 percent majority to win the election. This was 155 votes more than needed to avoid a runoff. Dellums received 41,992 votes, while his nearest challengers received 27,607 votes, and 10,928 votes respectively.

===Transition and citizen task forces===
Mayor-Elect Dellums&#x27;s transition to office involved 800 Oaklanders who joined 41 task forces to make recommendations on issues ranging from public safety to education and affordable housing.
Many of these recommendations helped to shape the policy agenda of the Dellums administration. The task forces recommended a land use policy which would emphasize zoning for job-creating business. This policy was adopted in 2007, and the city is being zoned. The task forces recommended a stronger policy on the hiring of local residents, and the City Council appointed a group to pursue this change. The task forces recommended a focus on the green economy, and the Mayor, along with a variety of community organizations created the Green Jobs Corps, an office of sustainability and the East Bay Green Corridor. Mayor Dellums reported that approximately two-thirds of the recommendations had been implemented as of the end of 2009. The Task Forces and the Inauguration itself, which included hundreds of the city&#x27;s least affluent residents, were considered examples of grassroots democracy.

===Public safety initiatives===
Crime rates were high when Dellums took office in January 2007 and at his first State of the City Address in January 2008, Dellums called for hiring more police officers. Dellums promised that by year&#x27;s end, the police department would be fully staffed at 803 officers. On November 14, 2008, 38 Oakland police officers were added to the force after graduating the 165th academy, bringing the department&#x27;s force to 837 officers, the most in OPD history.

In addition, to follow through on his calls for hiring more officers, Dellums offered Measure NN on the November 2008 ballot, a voter initiative parcel tax to hire 70 additional police officers at a hiring and training cost of $250,000 each. Though 55 percent of Oakland voters supported Measure NN, this failed to meet California&#x27;s &quot;two thirds&quot; constitutional requirement for the enactment of a new tax.

Dellums&#x27;s administration negotiated the passage of a new police contract which was especially noteworthy, as it broke the Oakland Police Officers Association&#x27;s opposition to the civilianization of certain OPD positions which were previously staffed by &quot;sworn,&quot; uniformed police officers, with concomitant payrolls and police academy training costs. OPD then hired &quot;non-sworn&quot; personnel to work some of its desk jobs and administrative jobs, freeing up academy uniformed officers for street patrol and investigative work.

On March 21, 2009, during the 2009 Oakland police shootings incident, the Oakland Police Department lost three sergeants and one officer. One of the officers left instructions in his emergency packet that if he were killed in the line of duty that Dellums not be permitted to speak at his funeral. Two of the officers&#x27; families requested the same, and when Dellums attended the March 28 public memorial service at the Oracle Arena he honored the requests.

In his State of the City address in 2008 Dellums promised to reduce the crime rate by 10% during 2009; the crime rate actually went down by 13%.

In 2009 Dellums hired the highly regarded Anthony Batts, formerly the Long Beach police chief. Batts had a record of reducing both crime and police shootings in that Southern California city.

===Education initiatives===
Noting that reducing teacher turn-over and improving the engagement of teachers with the families of their students would require increasing the number of teachers who came from the local community, Dellums initiated a program to create more teachers who were diverse local residents. He held teacher recruitment summits in City Hall, helped the Teach Tomorrow in Oakland program to obtain $2.7 million in federal funding, and spoke to the U.S. Conference of Mayors about the national potential of such programs. The Community Task Forces remained active in these efforts.

In 2009 Dellums launched an anti-drop-out initiative which included sponsoring back to school rallies at City Hall and participating with the school district in truancy reduction efforts. He accepted an invitation from the national organization, America&#x27;s Promise, to join their efforts at drop-out prevention. As part of this effort, he started Oakland&#x27;s Promise, recruited several dozen community-based organizations to participate, held a Summit with 350 participants, and adopted an Action Plan to cut Oakland&#x27;s drop-out rate in half.

===Promoting Oakland===
As mayor, Dellums proposed the idea of Oakland as a &quot;Model City&quot;. He argued that Oakland is &quot;big enough to be significant and small enough to get your arms around&quot;, and that the federal government needs a city like Oakland on which to try out new urban policy inventions.

From 2008, Dellums campaigned to bring millions in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act federal stimulus funding to Oakland, using both his extensive Washington D.C. contacts and the idea of the Model City. By the end of 2009, his efforts had yielded US$65 million in stimulus funding for Oakland, including the largest police grant of any city in the country, and the second largest amount in competitive funding after Chicago.

===Criticism and recall efforts===
After his election as mayor of Oakland, Dellums came under criticism for a wide range of issues, including a lack of transparency in government, ineffectual governance, and alleged extended absence from his duties at City Hall. He was criticized for refusing to disavow a staff-generated letter sent in his name in July 2007 to a Federal Bankruptcy Court in support of Your Black Muslim Bakery, whose owners were suspects in the 2007 murder of reporter Chauncey Bailey. In 2009, Dellums and his wife were cited with failure to pay over $239,000 in federal income taxes.

In 2007, Oakland reporter Elise Ackerman launched an unsuccessful campaign to recall Dellums and released an open letter addressed to Dellums. When addressing a town hall-style meeting in 2007, Dellums declared: &quot;I&#x27;m giving it everything that I have. If that&#x27;s not enough, that&#x27;s cool. Recall me and let me get on with my private life.&quot;

Dellums later announced he would not seek a second term as mayor of Oakland in the 2010 election. He was succeeded by Jean Quan.

==Death==
Dellums died of complications from prostate cancer on July 30, 2018, at age 82. He was interred with military honors in section 82, at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Partisan affiliations==

Although he ran as a Democrat and caucused as a Democrat in Congress, Dellums described himself as a socialist. He was the first self-described socialist in Congress since Victor L. Berger. In the 1970s, Dellums was a member of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC), an offshoot of the Socialist Party of America. He later became vice-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which was formed by a merger between the DSOC and the New American Movement, and which works within and outside the Democratic Party.

While running for mayor of Oakland, Dellums was officially registered as a member of the Democratic Party.

On October 1, 2007, Dellums endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary at a press conference held at Laney College in Oakland. He was named national chair of Clinton&#x27;s Urban Policy Committee.

Dellums was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Autobiography==
In 2000, Dellums published an autobiography, cowritten with H. Lee Halterman, entitled &quot;Lying Down with the Lions: A Public Life from the Streets of Oakland to the Halls of Power.&quot;

<text>Biosemiotics (from the Greek βίος &quot;bios&quot;, &quot;life&quot; and σημειωτικός &quot;sēmeiōtikos&quot;, &quot;observant of signs&quot;) is a field of semiotics and biology that studies the prelinguistic meaning-making, biological interpretation processes, production of signs and codes and communication processes in the biological realm.

Biosemiotics integrates the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a paradigmatic shift in the scientific view of life, in which semiosis (sign process, including meaning and interpretation) is one of its immanent and intrinsic features. The term &quot;biosemiotic&quot; was first used by Friedrich S. Rothschild in 1962, but Thomas Sebeok, Thure von Uexküll, Jesper Hoffmeyer and many others have implemented the term and field. The field is generally divided between theoretical and applied biosemiotics.

Insights from biosemiotics have also been adopted in the humanities and social sciences, including human-animal studies, human-plant studies and cybersemiotics.

==Definition==
Biosemiotics is the study of meaning making processes in the living realm, or, to elaborate, a study of 
* signification, communication and habit formation of living processes 
* semiosis (creating and changing sign relations) in living nature
* the biological basis of all signs and sign interpretation
* interpretative processes, codes and cognition in organisms

==Main branches==
According to the basic types of semiosis under study, biosemiotics can be divided into 
*vegetative semiotics (also &quot;endosemiotics&quot;, or phytosemiotics), the study of semiosis at the cellular and molecular level (including the translation processes related to genome and the organic form or phenotype); vegetative semiosis occurs in all organisms at their cellular and tissue level; vegetative semiotics includes prokaryote semiotics, sign-mediated interactions in bacteria communities such as quorum sensing and quorum quenching.
*zoosemiotics or animal semiotics, or the study of animal forms of knowing; animal semiosis occurs in the organisms with neuromuscular system, also includes anthroposemiotics, the study of semiotic behavior in humans.

According to the dominant aspect of semiosis under study, the following labels have been used: biopragmatics, biosemantics, and biosyntactics.

==History==
Apart from Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) and Charles W. Morris (1903–1979), early pioneers of biosemiotics were Jakob von Uexküll (1864–1944), Heini Hediger (1908–1992), Giorgio Prodi (1928–1987), Marcel Florkin (1900–1979) and Friedrich S. Rothschild (1899–1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were Thomas Sebeok (1920–2001) and Thure von Uexküll (1908–2004).

In the 1980s a circle of mathematicians active in Theoretical Biology, René Thom (Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques), Yannick Kergosien (Dalhousie University and Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques), and Robert Rosen (Dalhousie University, also a former member of the Buffalo group with Howard H. Pattee), explored the relations between Semiotics and Biology using such headings as &quot;Nature Semiotics&quot;, &quot;Semiophysics&quot;, or &quot;Anticipatory Systems&quot; and taking a modeling approach.

The contemporary period (as initiated by Copenhagen-Tartu school) include biologists Jesper Hoffmeyer, Kalevi Kull, Claus Emmeche, Terrence Deacon, semioticians Martin Krampen, Paul Cobley, philosophers Donald Favareau, John Deely, John Collier and complex systems scientists Howard H. Pattee, Michael Conrad, Luis M. Rocha, Cliff Joslyn and León Croizat.

In 2001, an annual international conference for biosemiotic research known as the &quot;Gatherings in Biosemiotics&quot; was inaugurated, and has taken place every year since.

In 2004, a group of biosemioticians – Marcello Barbieri, Claus Emmeche, Jesper Hoffmeyer, Kalevi Kull, and Anton Markoš – decided to establish an international journal of biosemiotics. Under their editorship, the &quot;Journal of Biosemiotics&quot; was launched by Nova Science Publishers in 2005 (two issues published), and with the same five co-editors &quot;Biosemiotics&quot; was launched by Springer in 2008. The book series &quot;Biosemiotics&quot; (Springer), edited by Claus Emmeche, Donald Favareau, Kalevi Kull, and Alexei Sharov, began in 2007 and 27 volumes have been published in the series by 2024. 

The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies was established in 2005 by Donald Favareau and the five editors listed above. A collective programmatic paper on the basic theses of biosemiotics appeared in 2009. and in 2010, an 800 page textbook and anthology, &quot;Essential Readings in Biosemiotics,&quot; was published, with bibliographies and commentary by Donald Favareau.

One of roots for biosemiotics has been medical semiotics. In 2016, Springer published &quot;Biosemiotic Medicine: Healing in the World of Meaning,&quot; edited by Farzad Goli as part of Studies in Neuroscience, Consciousness and Spirituality. 

===In the humanities===
Since the work of Jakob von Uexküll and Martin Heidegger, several scholars in the humanities have engaged with or appropriated ideas from biosemiotics in their own projects; conversely, biosemioticians have critically engaged with or reformulated humanistic theories using ideas from biosemiotics and complexity theory. For instance, Andreas Weber has reformulated some of Hans Jonas&#x27;s ideas using concepts from biosemiotics, and biosemiotics have been used to interpret the poetry of John Burnside.

Since 2021, the American philosopher Jason Josephson Storm has drawn on biosemiotics and empirical research on animal communication to propose &quot;hylosemiotics&quot;, a theory of ontology and communication that Storm believes could allow the humanities to move beyond the linguistic turn.

John Deely&#x27;s work also represents an engagement between humanistic and biosemiotic approaches. Deely was trained as a historian and not a biologist but discussed biosemiotics and zoosemiotics extensively in his introductory works on semiotics and clarified terms that are relevant for biosemiotics. Although his idea of physiosemiotics was criticized by practicing biosemioticians, Paul Cobley, Donald Favareau, and Kalevi Kull wrote that &quot;the debates on this conceptual point between Deely and the biosemiotics community were always civil and marked by a mutual admiration for the contributions of the other towards the advancement of our understanding of sign relations.&quot;

<text>Charles Richard Johnson (born April 23, 1948) is an American scholar and the author of novels, short stories, screen-and-teleplays, and essays, most often with a philosophical orientation. Johnson has directly addressed the issues of black life in America in novels such as &quot;Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Middle Passage&quot;. Johnson was born in 1948 in Evanston, Illinois, and spent most of his career at the University of Washington in Seattle.

&quot;The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English&quot; says that Johnson&#x27;s works &quot;combine historical accuracy, parable, and elements of the fantastic in rendering the experience of African Americans.&quot;

==Career==

=== Political cartooning ===
He first came to prominence in the 1960s as a political cartoonist and illustrator. At the age of 15, he was a student of cartoonist/mystery writer Lawrence Lariar. After a two-year correspondence course with Lariar, Johnson began publishing his artwork professionally in 1965, drawing illustrations for the catalog of a magic company in Chicago, and publishing three stories in his high school&#x27;s newspaper as well as panel cartoons and a comic strip that in 1966 took two second-place awards in the sports and humor divisions of the Columbia Scholastic Press Association&#x27;s cartoon contest. He continued drawing and publishing prolifically during his years as an undergraduate journalism major at Southern Illinois University, which in 1977 awarded him the Delta Award &quot;for significant contribution to intellectual commerce of our time&quot; (sponsored by Friends of Morris Library) and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1995.

In his first career as a cartoonist (1965–72), Johnson churned out hundreds of drawings, comic strips, panel cartoons and illustrations for the student paper &quot;The Daily Egyptian&quot;, regular editorial cartoons for &quot;The Southern Illinoisan&quot;, illustrations for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, national African-American publications including &quot;Black World &quot;(formerly &quot;Negro Digest&quot;), &quot;Ebony&quot;, and &quot;Players&quot;, one-page comic book scripts for the now defunct &quot;Charlton Comics&quot;, and taught cartooning in SIU&#x27;s &quot;Free School.&quot; One of his earliest published articles is &quot;Creating the Political Cartoon,&quot; published in &quot;Scholastic/Editor/Communications&quot; and &quot;Graphics&quot; (March 1973).

Inspired by a lecture he heard in 1969 by Amiri Baraka (né Leroi Jones), Johnson drew the collection of racial satire titled &quot;Black Humor&quot; (Chicago: Johnson Publishing Company, 1970). A second collection of political satire appeared in 1972, &quot;Half-Past Nation-Time&quot; (Aware Press, California).

In 1970, he created, hosted, and co-produced at WSIU-TV &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Pad&quot;, an early PBS how-to-draw series broadcast nationally. It consisted of 52, 15-minute lessons in cartooning based on his earlier two years of lessons with Lawrence Lariar. Today, only three episodes of this series have survived.

=== Higher education and early novels ===
Johnson received his B.S. degree in journalism and M.A. in philosophy from Southern Illinois University in 1971 and 1973 and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Stony Brook University in 1988. In 2013, Johnson was awarded by his old philosophy department the first &quot;Don Ihde Distinguished Alumni Award&quot;, 78-year-old Ihde being one of America&#x27;s preeminent phenomenologists, and the director for Johnson&#x27;s dissertation, &quot;Being and Race: Black Writing Since 1970&quot; (1988), a literary manifesto published by Indiana University Press that used the methods of Continental philosophy to examine African-American literature and create an aesthetic position. After writing six of what he calls &quot;apprentice novels&quot; between 1970 and 1972 (one of these was an early draft of &quot;Middle Passage&quot;), which were not published, Johnson wrote his seventh and first philosophical novel, &quot;Faith and the Good Thing&quot;, in nine months with his mentor, the late John Gardner, providing him with feedback. This novel was published in 1974 by Viking Press, and Johnson stated then, as he would over the years, that his goal was to contribute to and enrich the tradition of &quot;African-American philosophical fiction&quot;. He identified early practitioners of this genre as being Jean Toomer, Richard Wright, and Ralph Ellison.

Early in his writing career, Johnson&#x27;s mentor was the novelist John Gardner.

=== University of Washington ===
In 1976, Johnson was hired to teach at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW). He received early tenure in three years at UW, then early full professorship after another three years, following the publication of his second novel, &quot;Oxherding Tale &quot;(1982), a slave narrative steeped in Eastern thought, and referring to the classic &quot;10 Oxherding Pictures&quot; of 16th-century artist Kakuan Shien. A student of Buddhism and Eastern thought all his life, as well as a student of Sanskrit since 1998, Johnson took formal vows on November 14, 2007, in the Soto Zen tradition (the 10 Precepts) with mendicant monk Claude AnShin Thomas, author of &quot;At Hell&#x27;s Gate: A Soldier&#x27;s Journey From War to Peace&quot; (2004). Johnson is a contributing writer for &quot;Tricycle: The Buddhist Review&quot;, and publishes regularly in &quot;Shambhala Sun&quot;, &quot;Buddhadharma: The Practitioner&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;, and has contributed to &quot;Turning Wheel: The Journal of Socially Engaged Buddhism&quot;. A collection of these writings appeared in &quot;Turning the Wheel: Essays on Buddhism and Writing&quot; (Scribner, 2003), and was followed in 2014 by a sequel from Shambhala Publications, &quot;Taming the Ox: Buddhist Stories, and Reflections on Politics, Race, Culture, and Spiritual Practice&quot;. 
In 1986, Johnson&#x27;s first story collection, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was short-listed for the PEN/Faulkner, and he was identified in a survey conducted at UCLA as one of the ten best short story writers in America. His other story collections include &quot;Soulcatcher and Other Stories&quot; (2001), which were 12 fictions written to dramatize the historical record in the companion book to the PBS series &quot;Africans in America&quot;, broadcast in 1998 (these are the only stories a writer has been commissioned to do for a history book). His second collection is &quot;Dr. King&#x27;s Refrigerator and Other Bedtime Stories&quot; (half of the stories in this collection were written for Humanities Washington&#x27;s yearly &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; literary gala). His short stories have appeared in &quot;Best American Short Stories &quot;(1982, 1995), &quot;O. Henry Prize Stories &quot;(1993), &quot;Playboy Stories: The Best of Forty Years of Short Fiction &quot;(1994), &quot;Best Buddhist Writing&quot; (2006, 2007, 2008), &quot;Best Spiritual Writing&quot; (2010), and, like his novels, have been translated into several languages like Russian, Italian, Spanish, South Korean, and Chinese. Two of his stories, &quot;Menagerie: A Child&#x27;s Fable&quot; and &quot;A Soldier for the Crown&quot; were dramatized by actors for National Public Radio&#x27;s Symphony Space &quot;Selected Shorts.&quot;

For the U.S. Information Agency (now the State Department) he has lectured in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, France, Indonesia, Japan, and Spain.
For 20 years, and after his series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Pad&quot;, Johnson wrote approximately 20 screen and teleplays. The first was &quot;Charlie Smith and the Fritter Tree&quot; (1978), which was about the at the time the oldest living American, 136-year-old Charlie Smith. With John Allman he shares credit for &quot;Booker&quot; (1985), a story about the childhood of Booker T. Washington that received a Writers Guild Award for being the &quot;outstanding script in 1985 in the category of Television Children&#x27;s Shows, and many other awards. In 1981, he served as one of two writer-producers for the second season of the PBS series &quot;Up and Coming&quot;.
As a book reviewer, he published over 50 book reviews in numerous publications, including &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Washington Post Book World&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; (London), &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Shambhala Sun&quot;. For 20 years, between 1978 and 1998, he was fiction editor of the &quot;Seattle Review&quot;. He has served as a judge for many literary prizes, among them the Pulitzer Prize in fiction (1992, 1995, 2010) and National Book Award in fiction (1988, 1999, and 2009), twice chairing the fiction panel for the latter. He sponsors the Marie Claire Davis Award for a writing student at Evanston Township High School, and the Charles Johnson Fiction Award at Southern Illinois University, a national competition open to all college students.

Johnson has been a practicing martial artist since 1967 when he trained at Chi Tao Chuan of the Monastery in Chicago. Since 1981, he has been a practitioner and sometimes teacher in the Choy Li Fut kung-fu lineage of grandmaster Doc-Fai Wong in San Francisco.

Until his retirement in 2009, Johnson was the S. Wilson and Grace M. Pollock Endowed Professor of English at the University of Washington.

== Awards, acknowledgments, and response ==
&quot;Middle Passage&quot; won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1990, making him the first African-American man to receive this prize since Ralph Ellison won in 1953. Johnson&#x27;s acceptance speech was a tribute to Ellison. Johnson received a MacArthur Fellowship or &quot;Genius Grant&quot; in 1998. He is also the recipient of National Endowment For The Arts and Guggenheim Fellowships, and many other prizes such as a 2002 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and his most recent award is The Humanities Washington Award 2013 for creating and contributing for 15 years a new, original short story to a literary event called &quot;Bedtime Stories,&quot; which since 1998 has raised a million dollars for the literacy programs of the non-profit organization Humanities Washington.

In 2003, the Charles Johnson Society was inaugurated at the American Literature Association. This is a literary society devoted to scholarly papers and articles on Johnson&#x27;s work and the genre of philosophical fiction in general. Several literary studies of his work have been published, among these are &quot;Charles Johnson&#x27;s Spiritual Imagination&quot; by Jonathan Little (University of Missouri Press, 1997); &quot;Charles Johnson&#x27;s Novels: Writing the American Palimpsest&quot; by the late Rudolph P. Byrd (Indiana University Press, 2005); &quot;Charles Johnson&#x27;s Fiction&quot; by William R. Nash (University of Illinois Press, 2003); &quot;Understanding Charles Johnson&quot;, by the late Gary Storhoff (University of South Carolina Press, 2004); &quot;Charles Johnson: The Novelist as Philosopher&quot;, edited by Marc C. Conner and William R. Nash (University Press of Mississippi, 2007); and &quot;Charles Johnson in Context&quot; by Linda Furgerson Selzer (University of Massachusetts Press, 2009). After Johnson&#x27;s retirement from teaching, a festschrift book celebrating the author&#x27;s work was published in India, &quot;Charles Johnson: Embracing the World&quot;, edited by Nibir K. Ghosh and American poet E. Ethelbert Miller (Authorspress, 2011).

In the spring of 2021, &quot;Chicago Quarterly Review&quot; released its &quot;Anthology of Black American Literature&quot;, a special issue guest-edited by Johnson.

<text>NCAA men&#x27;s ice hockey championship refers to either of the two tournaments in men&#x27;s ice hockey – one in Division I and one in Division III – contested by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) since 1971. The NCAA Division II Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament, contested from 1978 to 1984 and from 1993 to 1999, was discontinued due to a lack of Division II conferences sponsoring ice hockey.

*NCAA Division I men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament
*NCAA Division III men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament

Since 1999, the semifinals and finals for the Division I championship have been branded as the &quot;Frozen Four&quot;, echoing the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament&#x27;s &quot;Final Four&quot;.

The NCAA started a Women&#x27;s Frozen Four beginning with the 2000–01 season.

The Hobey Baker Award ceremony, Hockey Humanitarian Award ceremony, and USCHO.com Town Hall Meeting take place annually during Frozen Four weekend.

The 2020 Championships were cancelled due to ongoing concerns over the coronavirus.

<text>The annual NCAA women&#x27;s ice hockey tournament—officially known as the National Collegiate Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship—is a college ice hockey tournament held in the United States by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the top women&#x27;s team in the NCAA. 

Unlike most NCAA sports, women&#x27;s ice hockey uses a modified version of the National Collegiate championship format, which means Division I and Division II teams compete against each other in the same tournament.

==Origins==
The NCAA championship of women&#x27;s ice hockey began in 2001, although several universities had had women&#x27;s teams established since the early 1970s.

In 1965, the first collegiate women&#x27;s ice hockey team in the United States was created at Brown University. In February 1966, the team, named the &quot;Pembroke Pandas&quot;, played its first match. Their opponents were the Walpole Brooms, a non-collegiate team. The women&#x27;s ice hockey program of Cornell University began in 1971. The Big Red team competed in its first match in 1972, which it won 4–3, against Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight matches and lost half, including two defeats against the Pembroke Pandas. Yale University made its debut in women&#x27;s hockey on December 9, 1975. The University of Minnesota Duluth, the University of New Hampshire, and the rest of the Ivy League schools have similar histories.

In 1976, Brown University would host the first ever Ivy League women&#x27;s ice hockey tournament. Competitors in the tournament included Princeton, Yale, and Cornell, which won the tournament. Women&#x27;s ice hockey continued growth and acceptance continued through the early 1980s. In 1984, the Providence Friars won the inaugural ECAC women&#x27;s ice hockey championship.

In the 1997–98 season, the American Women&#x27;s College Hockey Alliance (AWCHA) made its debut. It was financed by the United States Olympic Committee. This allowed for the first national women&#x27;s ice hockey championship to occur, which was won by New Hampshire. The 1997–98 season also saw the creation of the Patty Kazmaier Award, designed to recognize the most remarkable women&#x27;s collegiate ice hockey player every season. The AWCHA also conducted championships in 1999 and 2000, which were won by Harvard and Minnesota respectively.

During the 1999–2000 season, WCHA joined the ECAC in an attempt to make women&#x27;s ice hockey an NCAA sanctioned sport. In August 2000, the NCAA announced that it would set up a national division of women&#x27;s ice hockey with a national championship at the end of every season, starting with the 2000–01 season. The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs won the inaugural tournament defeating the St. Lawrence Skating Saints 4–2 in the championship game.

==NCAA Division I women&#x27;s ice hockey==

In all, 44 schools in the United States, ranging from the Midwest to the East Coast, sponsor varsity women&#x27;s hockey at the National Collegiate (Divisions I and II) level. Five National Collegiate conferences are currently recognized by the NCAA—Atlantic Hockey America, ECAC Hockey, Hockey East, New England Women&#x27;s Hockey Alliance, and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.

==Format==
Under NCAA rules, Division II schools are allowed to compete as Division I members in sports in which a D-II championship is not contested. As there is no Division II championship for women&#x27;s ice hockey, this rule applies to the tournament. The official name of the &quot;Division I&quot; tournament is the National Collegiate Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship, which reflects the NCAA&#x27;s formal terminology for championship events that are open to schools from multiple divisions.

This tournament is a single elimination competition of eleven teams. The semi-finals and finals are called the &quot;Women&#x27;s Frozen Four.&quot; This moniker is similar to the name used by the NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship. The term is derived from the term &quot;Final four.&quot;

The Patty Kazmaier Award ceremony takes place annually during Women&#x27;s Frozen Four weekend.

==History==
Although many schools from many conferences have been competitive, the first 13 championships were won by only three different schools all originating from the WCHA: Minnesota Duluth, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In 2014, the WCHA&#x27;s hold on the championship was finally broken when Clarkson defeated Minnesota. In 2022, Ohio State won the national championship, making them the 4th WCHA team to win. The ECAC, from which Clarkson originated, has easily been the second most competitive conference, with eleven appearances in ten national title games, including the first five games. Hockey East has had four title game appearances, twice by Boston University and once each by Boston College and Northeastern. Atlantic Hockey America will play its first season in 2024–25; its women&#x27;s predecessor, CHA, had one title game appearance, by Mercyhurst in 2009. The 2020 championship was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2017, the NCAA announced that it had reached a four-year deal with Big Ten Network to televise the Women&#x27;s national championship game beginning in 2017, and the Frozen Four semi-finals beginning in 2018.

In 2021, ESPN announced that it had acquired the rights under a multi-year deal, with ESPNU to air one semi-final and the national championship annually. The other semi-final will be carried via streaming.

<text>Electrification is the process of powering by electricity and, in many contexts, the introduction of such power by changing over from an earlier power source. In the context of history of technology and economic development, electrification refers to the build-out of the electricity generation and electric power distribution systems. In the context of sustainable energy, electrification refers to the build-out of super grids with energy storage to accommodate the energy transition to renewable energy and the switch of end-uses to electricity.

The electrification of particular sectors of the economy, particularly out of context, is called by modified terms such as &quot;factory electrification&quot;, &quot;household electrification&quot;, &quot;rural electrification&quot; and &quot;railway electrification&quot;. In the context of sustainable energy, terms such as &quot;transport electrification&quot; (referring to electric vehicles) or &quot;heating electrification&quot; (referring to heat pumps) are used. It may also apply to changing industrial processes such as smelting, melting, separating or refining from coal or coke heating, or to chemical processes to some type of electric process such as electric arc furnace, electric induction or resistance heating, or electrolysis or electrolytic separating.

==Benefits of electrification==
Electrification was called &quot;the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th Century&quot; by the National Academy of Engineering, and it continues in both rich and poor countries.

===Benefits of electric lighting===
Electric lighting is highly desirable. The light is much brighter than oil or gas lamps, and there is no soot. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil or gas lighting. Electric lighting was so much safer than oil or gas that some companies were able to pay for the electricity with the insurance savings.

===Pre-electric power===
In 1851, Charles Babbage stated:One of the inventions most important to a class of highly skilled workers (engineers) would be a small motive power - ranging perhaps from the force of from half a man to that of two horses, which might commence as well as cease its action at a moment&#x27;s notice, require no expense of time for its management and be of modest cost both in original cost and in daily expense.
To be efficient steam engines needed to be several hundred horsepower. Steam engines and boilers also required operators and maintenance. For these reasons the smallest commercial steam engines were about 2 horsepower. This was above the need for many small shops. Also, a small steam engine and boiler cost about $7,000 while an old blind horse that could develop 1/2 horsepower cost $20 or less. Machinery to use horses for power cost $300 or less.

Many power requirements were less than that of a horse. Shop machines, such as woodworking lathes, were often powered with a one- or two-man crank. Household sewing machines were powered with a foot treadle; however, factory sewing machines were steam-powered from a line shaft. Dogs were sometimes used on machines such as a treadmill, which could be adapted to churn butter.

In the late 19th century specially designed &quot;power buildings&quot; leased space to small shops. These building supplied power to the tenants from a steam engine through line shafts.

Electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation was more efficient than small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses.

Electric motors were more efficient than human or animal power. The conversion efficiency for animal feed to work is between 4 and 5% compared to over 30% for electricity generated using coal.

===Economic impact of electrification===
Electrification and economic growth are highly correlated. In economics, the efficiency of electrical generation has been shown to correlate with &quot;technological progress&quot;.

In the U.S. from 1870 to 1880 each man-hour was provided with .55 hp. In 1950 each man-hour was provided with 5 hp, or a 2.8% annual increase, declining to 1.5% from 1930 to 1950. The period of electrification of factories and households from 1900 to 1940, was one of high productivity and economic growth.

Most studies of electrification and electric grids focused on industrial core countries in Europe and the United States. Elsewhere, wired electricity was often carried on and through the circuits of colonial rule. Some historians and sociologists considered the interplay of colonial politics and the development of electric grids: in India, Rao showed that linguistics-based regional politics—not techno-geographical considerations—led to the creation of two separate grids; in colonial Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Chikowero showed that electrification was racially based and served the white settler community while excluding Africans; and in Mandate Palestine, Shamir claimed that British electric concessions to a Zionist-owned company deepened the economic disparities between Arabs and Jews.

==Current extent of electrification==

While electrification of cities and homes has existed since the late 19th century, about 840 million people (mostly in Africa) had no access to grid electricity in 2017, down from 1.2 billion in 2010.

Vast gains in electrification were seen in the 1970s and 1980s—from 49% of the world&#x27;s population in 1970 to 76% in 1990. By the early 2010s, 81–83% of the world&#x27;s population had access to electricity.

==Electrification for sustainable energy==
Clean energy is mostly generated in the form of electricity, such as renewable energy or nuclear power. Switching to these energy sources requires that end uses, such as transport and heating, be electrified for the world&#x27;s energy systems to be sustainable. 

In the U.S. and Canada the use of heat pumps (HP) is economic if powered with solar photovoltaic (PV) devices to offset propane heating in rural areas and natural gas heating in cities. A 2023 study investigated: (1) a residential natural gas-based heating system and grid electricity, (2) a residential natural gas-based heating system with PV to serve the electric load, (3) a residential HP system with grid electricity, and (4) a residential HP+PV system. It found that under typical inflation conditions, the lifecycle cost of natural gas and reversible, air-source heat pumps are nearly identical, which in part explains why heat pump sales have surpassed gas furnace sales in the U.S. for the first time during a period of high inflation. With higher rates of inflation or lower PV capital costs, PV becomes a hedge against rising prices and encourages the adoption of heat pumps by also locking in both electricity and heating cost growth. The study concludes: &quot;The real internal rate of return for such prosumer technologies is 20x greater than a long-term certificate of deposit, which demonstrates the additional value PV and HP technologies offer prosumers over comparably secure investment vehicles while making substantive reductions in carbon emissions.&quot; This approach can be improved by integrating a thermal battery into the heat pump+solar energy heating system. 

===Transport electrification===

It is easier to sustainably produce electricity than it is to sustainably produce liquid fuels. Therefore, adoption of electric vehicles is a way to make transport more sustainable. Hydrogen vehicles may be an option for larger vehicles which have not yet been widely electrified, such as long distance lorries. While electric vehicle technology is relatively mature in road transport, electric shipping and aviation are still early in their development, hence sustainable liquid fuels may have a larger role to play in these sectors.

===Heating electrification===
A large fraction of the world population cannot afford sufficient cooling for their homes. In addition to air conditioning, which requires electrification and additional power demand, passive building design and urban planning will be needed to ensure cooling needs are met in a sustainable way. Similarly, many households in the developing and developed world suffer from fuel poverty and cannot heat their houses enough. Existing heating practices are often polluting.

A key sustainable solution to heating is electrification (heat pumps, or the less efficient electric heater). The IEA estimates that heat pumps currently provide only 5% of space and water heating requirements globally, but could provide over 90%. Use of ground source heat pumps not only reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, it also flattens the electric demand curve by eliminating the extreme summer peak electric supply requirements. However, heat pumps and resistive heating alone will not be sufficient for the electrification of industrial heat. This because in several processes higher temperatures are required which cannot be achieved with these types of equipment. For example, for the production of ethylene via steam cracking temperatures as high as 900 °C are required. Hence, drastically new processes are required. Nevertheless, power-to-heat is expected to be the first step in the electrification of the chemical industry with an expected large-scale implementation by 2025.

Some cities in the United States have started prohibiting gas hookups for new houses, with state laws passed and under consideration to either require electrification or prohibit local requirements. The UK government is experimenting with electrification for home heating to meet its climate goals. Ceramic and Induction heating for cooktops as well as industrial applications (for instance steam crackers) are examples of technologies that can be used to transition away from natural gas.

==Energy resilience==
Electricity is a &quot;sticky&quot; form of energy, in that it tends to stay in the continent or island where it is produced. It is also multi-sourced; if one source suffers a shortage, electricity can be produced from other sources, including renewable sources. As a result, in the long term it is a relatively resilient means of energy transmission. In the short term, because electricity must be supplied at the same moment it is consumed, it is somewhat unstable, compared to fuels that can be delivered and stored on-site. However, that can be mitigated by grid energy storage and distributed generation.

===Managing variable energy sources===

Solar and wind are variable renewable energy sources that supply electricity intermittently depending on the weather and the time of day. Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. In 2019, these sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity, a share that has grown rapidly.

There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar production are complementary on a daily and a season scale: There is more wind during the night and in winter, when solar energy production is low. Linking distant geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines allows for further cancelling out of variability. Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids, matching the times when variable energy production is highest. With storage, energy produced in excess can be released when needed. Building additional capacity for wind and solar generation can help to ensure that enough electricity is produced even during poor weather; during optimal weather energy generation may have to be curtailed. The final mismatch may be covered by using dispatchable energy sources such as hydropower, bioenergy, or natural gas.

===Energy storage===
Energy storage helps overcome barriers for intermittent renewable energy, and is therefore an important aspect of a sustainable energy system. The most commonly used storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity, which requires locations with large differences in height and access to water. Batteries, and specifically lithium-ion batteries, are also deployed widely. They contain cobalt, which is largely mined in Congo, a politically unstable region. More diverse geographical sourcing may ensure the stability of the supply-chain and their environmental impacts can be reduced by downcycling and recycling. Batteries typically store electricity for short periods; research is ongoing into technology with sufficient capacity to last through seasons. Pumped hydro storage and power-to-gas with capacity for multi-month usage has been implemented in some locations.

As of 2018, thermal energy storage is typically not as convenient as burning fossil fuels. High upfront costs form a barrier for implementation. Seasonal thermal energy storage requires large capacity; it has been implemented in some high-latitude regions for household heat.

== History of electrification ==

The earliest commercial uses of electricity were electroplating and the telegraph.

===Development of magnetos, dynamos and generators===

In the years 1831–1832, Michael Faraday discovered the operating principle of electromagnetic generators. The principle, later called Faraday&#x27;s law, is based on an electromotive force generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying magnetic flux as, for example, a wire moving through a magnetic field. Faraday built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk, a type of homopolar generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. Faraday&#x27;s first electromagnetic generator produced a small DC voltage.

Around 1832, Hippolyte Pixii improved the magneto by using a wire wound horseshoe, with the extra coils of conductor generating more current, but it was AC. André-Marie Ampère suggested a means of converting current from Pixii&#x27;s magneto to DC using a rocking switch. Later segmented commutators were used to produce direct current.

Around 1838-40, William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone developed a telegraph. In 1840 Wheatstone was using a magneto that he developed to power the telegraph. Wheatstone and Cooke made an important improvement in electrical generation by using a battery-powered electromagnet in place of a permanent magnet, which they patented in 1845. The self-excited magnetic field dynamo did away with the battery to power electromagnets. This type of dynamo was made by several people in 1866.

The first practical generator, the Gramme machine, was made by Z.T. Gramme, who sold many of these machines in the 1870s. British engineer R.E.B. Crompton improved the generator to allow better air cooling and made other mechanical improvements. Compound winding, which gave more stable voltage with load, improved the operating characteristics of generators.

The improvements in electrical generation technology in the 19th century increased its efficiency and reliability greatly. The first magnetos only converted a few percent of mechanical energy to electricity. By the end of the 19th century the highest efficiencies were over 90%.

===Electric lighting===

====Arc lighting====
Sir Humphry Davy invented the carbon arc lamp in 1802 upon discovering that electricity could produce a light arc with carbon electrodes. However, it was not used to any great extent until a practical means of generating electricity was developed.

Carbon arc lamps were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, which were then separated to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc. A common approach was to feed a carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap with a pair of electromagnets, one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the gravity feed.

Arc lamps of the time had very intense light output – in the range of 4,000 candlepower (candelas) – and released a lot of heat, and they were a fire hazard, all of which made them inappropriate for lighting homes.

In the 1850s, many of these problems were solved by the arc lamp invented by William Petrie and William Staite. The lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control the gap between the two carbon rods. Their light was used to light up the National Gallery in London and was a great novelty at the time. These arc lamps and designs similar to it, powered by large magnetos, were first installed on English lighthouses in the mid 1850s, but the technology suffered power limitations.

The first successful arc lamp (the Yablochkov candle) was developed by Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov using the Gramme generator. Its advantage lay in the fact that it did not require the use of a mechanical regulator like its predecessors. It was first exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1878 and was heavily promoted by Gramme. The arc light was installed along the half mile length of Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra, Place du Theatre Francais and around the Place de l&#x27;Opéra in 1878.

R. E. B. Crompton developed a more sophisticated design in 1878 which gave a much brighter and steadier light than the Yablochkov candle. In 1878, he formed Crompton &amp; Co. and began to manufacture, sell and install the Crompton lamp. His concern was one of the first electrical engineering firms in the world.

====Incandescent light bulbs====
Various forms of incandescent light bulbs had numerous inventors; however, the most successful early bulbs were those that used a carbon filament sealed in a high vacuum. These were invented by Joseph Swan in 1878 in Britain and by Thomas Edison in 1879 in the US. Edison’s lamp was more successful than Swan’s because Edison used a thinner filament, giving it higher resistance and thus conducting much less current. Edison began commercial production of carbon filament bulbs in 1880. Swan&#x27;s light began commercial production in 1881.

Swan&#x27;s house, in Low Fell, Gateshead, was the world&#x27;s first to have working light bulbs installed. The Lit &amp; Phil Library in Newcastle, was the first public room lit by electric light, and the Savoy Theatre was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity.

===Central power stations and isolated systems===

The first central station providing public power is believed to be one at Godalming, Surrey, UK, in autumn 1881. The system was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company, so the town council decided to use electricity. The system lit up arc lamps on the main streets and incandescent lamps on a few side streets with hydroelectric power. By 1882 between 8 and 10 households were connected, with a total of 57 lights. The system was not a commercial success, and the town reverted to gas.

The first large scale central distribution supply plant was opened at Holborn Viaduct in London in 1882. Equipped with 1000 incandescent lightbulbs that replaced the older gas lighting, the station lit up Holborn Circus including the offices of the General Post Office and the famous City Temple church. The supply was a direct current at 110 V; due to power loss in the copper wires, this amounted to 100 V for the customer.

Within weeks, a parliamentary committee recommended passage of the landmark 1882 Electric Lighting Act, which allowed the licensing of persons, companies or local authorities to supply electricity for any public or private purposes.

The first large scale central power station in America was Edison&#x27;s Pearl Street Station in New York, which began operating in September 1882. The station had six 200 horsepower Edison dynamos, each powered by a separate steam engine. It was located in a business and commercial district and supplied 110 volt direct current to 85 customers with 400 lamps. By 1884 Pearl Street was supplying 508 customers with 10,164 lamps.

By the mid-1880s, other electric companies were establishing central power stations and distributing electricity, including Crompton &amp; Co. and the Swan Electric Light Company in the UK, Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Westinghouse in the US and Siemens in Germany. By 1890 there were 1000 central stations in operation. The 1902 census listed 3,620 central stations. By 1925 half of power was provided by central stations.

====Load factor and isolated systems====
One of the biggest problems facing the early power companies was the hourly variable demand. When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high during the first hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked. As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide daytime service, with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897.

The ratio of the average load to the peak load of a central station is called the load factor. For electric companies to increase profitability and lower rates, it was necessary to increase the load factor. The way this was eventually accomplished was through motor load. Motors are used more during daytime and many run continuously. Electric street railways were ideal for load balancing. Many electric railways generated their own power and also sold power and operated distribution systems.

The load factor adjusted upward by the turn of the 20th century—at Pearl Street the load factor increased from 19.3% in 1884 to 29.4% in 1908. By 1929, the load factor around the world was greater than 50%, mainly due to motor load.

Before widespread power distribution from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings had their own power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam could be used for building and industrial process heat, which today is known as cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations. Cogeneration is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called microgeneration.

===Direct current electric motors===

The first commutator DC electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the British scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. The crucial advance that this represented over the motor demonstrated by Michael Faraday was the incorporation of a commutator. This allowed Sturgeon&#x27;s motor to be the first capable of providing continuous rotary motion.

Frank J. Sprague improved on the DC motor in 1884 by solving the problem of maintaining a constant speed with varying load and reducing sparking from the brushes. Sprague sold his motor through Edison Co. It is easy to vary speed with DC motors, which made them suited for a number of applications such as electric street railways, machine tools and certain other industrial applications where speed control was desirable.

Manufacturing was transitioned from line shaft and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors.

===Alternating current===
Although the first power stations supplied direct current, the distribution of alternating current soon became the most favored option. The main advantages of AC were that it could be transformed to high voltage to reduce transmission losses and that AC motors could easily run at constant speeds.

Alternating current technology was rooted in Faraday&#x27;s 1830–31 discovery that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a circuit.
The first person to conceive of a rotating magnetic field was Walter Baily who gave a workable demonstration of his battery-operated polyphase motor aided by a commutator on June 28, 1879, to the Physical Society of London. Nearly identical to Baily’s apparatus, French electrical engineer Marcel Deprez in 1880 published a paper that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two-phase AC system of currents to produce it. In 1886, English engineer Elihu Thomson built an AC motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his wattmeter.

It was in the 1880s that the technology was commercially developed for large scale electricity generation and transmission. In 1882 the British inventor and electrical engineer Sebastian de Ferranti, working for the company Siemens collaborated with the distinguished physicist Lord Kelvin to pioneer AC power technology including an early transformer.

A power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system. Many of their designs were adapted to the particular laws governing electrical distribution in the UK.

Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti went into this business in 1882 when he set up a shop in London designing various electrical devices. Ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on, and was one of the few experts in this system in the UK. With the help of Lord Kelvin, Ferranti pioneered the first AC power generator and transformer in 1882. John Hopkinson, a British physicist, invented the three-wire (three-phase) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a patent in 1882.

The Italian inventor Galileo Ferraris invented a polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The idea was that two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents might be used to produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.

====AC power stations====
The first AC power station was built by the English electrical engineer Sebastian de Ferranti. In 1887 the London Electric Supply Corporation hired Ferranti for the design of their power station at Deptford. He designed the building, the generating plant and the distribution system. It was built at the Stowage, a site to the west of the mouth of Deptford Creek once used by the East India Company. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000 V) AC current, it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then &quot;stepped down&quot; with transformers for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world.

In the U.S., George Westinghouse, who had become interested in the power transformer developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his AC lighting system, using a transmission system with a 20:1 step up voltage with step-down. In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems. A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration until late in the schedule. Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000 hp, 250 rpm, 25 Hz, two phase generators. The hydro power plant went online in 1895, and it was the largest one until that date.

By the 1890s, single and poly-phase AC was undergoing rapid introduction. In the U.S. by 1902, 61% of generating capacity was AC, increasing to 95% in 1917. Despite the superiority of alternating current for most applications, a few existing DC systems continued to operate for several decades after AC became the standard for new systems.

===Steam turbines===

The efficiency of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work was a critical factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations. Early projects used reciprocating steam engines, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the steam turbine fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution. This made parallel operation of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses. Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service.

The modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by British engineer Sir Charles Parsons, whose first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5 kW (10 hp) of electricity. The invention of Parsons&#x27;s steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible. Parsons turbines were widely introduced in English central stations by 1894; the first electric supply company in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators was Parsons&#x27;s own electricity supply company Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company, set up in 1894. Within Parsons&#x27;s lifetime, the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times.
The first U.S. turbines were two De Leval units at Edison Co. in New York in 1895. The first U.S. Parsons turbine was at Westinghouse Air Brake Co. near Pittsburgh.

Steam turbines also had capital cost and operating advantages over reciprocating engines. The condensate from steam engines was contaminated with oil and could not be reused, while condensate from a turbine is clean and typically reused. Steam turbines were a fraction of the size and weight of comparably rated reciprocating steam engine. Steam turbines can operate for years with almost no wear. Reciprocating steam engines required high maintenance. Steam turbines can be manufactured with capacities far larger than any steam engines ever made, giving important economies of scale.

Steam turbines could be built to operate on higher pressure and temperature steam. A fundamental principle of thermodynamics is that the higher the temperature of the steam entering an engine, the higher the efficiency. The introduction of steam turbines motivated a series of improvements in temperatures and pressures. The resulting increased conversion efficiency lowered electricity prices.

The power density of boilers was increased by using forced combustion air and by using compressed air to feed pulverized coal. Also, coal handling was mechanized and automated.

===Electrical grid===
With the realization of long distance power transmission it was possible to interconnect different central stations to balance loads and improve load factors. Interconnection became increasingly desirable as electrification grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century.

Charles Merz, of the Merz &amp; McLellan consulting partnership, built the Neptune Bank Power Station near Newcastle upon Tyne in 1901, and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe. In 1905 he tried to influence Parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country&#x27;s electricity supply industry, but it was not until World War I that Parliament began to take this idea seriously, appointing him head of a Parliamentary Committee to address the problem. In 1916 Merz pointed out that the UK could use its small size to its advantage, by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently. His findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system in the UK.

The more significant Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926, led to the setting up of the National Grid. The Central Electricity Board standardised the nation&#x27;s electricity supply and established the first synchronised AC grid, running at 132 kilovolts and 50 Hertz. This started operating as a national system, the National Grid, in 1938.

In the United States it became a national objective after the power crisis during the summer of 1918 in the midst of World War I to consolidate supply. In 1934 the Public Utility Holding Company Act recognized electric utilities as public goods of importance along with gas, water, and telephone companies and thereby were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations.

=== Household electrification ===

The electrification of households in Europe and North America began in the early 20th century in major cities and in areas served by electric railways and increased rapidly until about 1930 when 70% of households were electrified in the U.S.

Rural areas were electrified first in Europe, and in the U.S. the Rural Electric Administration, established in 1935 brought electrification to the underserviced rural areas.

In the Soviet Union, as in the United States, rural electrification progressed more slowly than in urban areas. It wasn&#x27;t until the Brezhnev era that electrification became widespread in rural regions, with the Soviet rural electrification drive largely completed by the early 1970s. 

In China, the turmoil of the Warlord Era, the Civil War and the Japanese invasion in the early 20th century delayed electrification for decades. It was only after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 that the country was positioned to pursue widespread electrification. During the Mao years, while electricity became commonplace in cities, rural areas were largely neglected. At the time of Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, 25% of Chinese households still lacked access to electricity. 

Deng Xiaoping, who became China&#x27;s paramount leader in 1978, initiated a rural electrification drive as part of a broader modernization effort. By the late 1990s, electricity had become ubiquitous in regional areas. The very last remote villages in China were connected to the grid in 2015. 

===Historical cost of electricity===
Central station electric power generating provided power more efficiently and at lower cost than small generators. The capital and operating cost per unit of power were also cheaper with central stations. The cost of electricity fell dramatically in the first decades of the twentieth century due to the introduction of steam turbines and the improved load factor after the introduction of AC motors. As electricity prices fell, usage increased dramatically and central stations were scaled up to enormous sizes, creating significant economies of scale. For the historical cost see Ayres-Warr (2002) Fig. 7.

<text>leJOS is a firmware replacement for Lego Mindstorms programmable bricks. Different variants of the software support the original Robotics Invention System, the NXT, and the EV3. It includes a Java virtual machine, which allows Lego Mindstorms robots to be programmed in the Java programming language. It also includes &#x27;iCommand.jar&#x27; which allows you to communicate via bluetooth with the original firmware of the Mindstorm. It is often used for teaching Java to first-year computer science students. The leJOS-based robot &quot;Jitter&quot; flew around on the International Space Station in December 2001.

==Pronunciation==
According to the official website:

: &quot;In English, the word is similar to Legos, except there is a J for Java, so the correct pronunciation would be Ley-J-oss. If you are brave and want to pronounce the name in Spanish, there is a word &quot;lejos&quot; which means far, and it is pronounced Lay-hoss.&quot;

The name leJOS was conceived by José Solórzano, based on the
acronym for Java Operating System (JOS),
the name of another operating system for the RCX, legOS, and
the Spanish word &quot;lejos.&quot;

==History==
leJOS was originally conceived as TinyVM and developed by José Solórzano in late 1999. It started out as a hobby open source project, which he later forked into what is known today as leJOS. Many contributors joined the project and provided important enhancements. Among them, Brian Bagnall, Jürgen Stuber and Paul Andrews, who later took over the project as José essentially retired from it.

As of August 20, 2006, the original leJOS for the RCX has been discontinued with the 3.0 release. Soon afterwards, iCommand, a library to control the NXT from a Bluetooth-enabled computer via LCP, was released. This library made use of the standard Lego firmware. This library was later superseded by leJOS NXJ 0.8. In January 2007, a full port to the new Lego Mindstorms NXT was released as a firmware replacement. This is far faster (x15 or so) than the RCX version, has more memory available, a menu system, Bluetooth support using the Bluecove library, and allows access to many other NXT features.

In 2008, versions 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 were released. In addition to numerous improvements to the core classes, the Eclipse plugin was released along with a new version of the tutorial. In 2009, there were 2 more major releases: 0.8 and 0.85. In May 2011 0.9 was released. Broadly speaking, the releases have concentrated on improvements to navigation algorithms, as well as support for numerous 3rd party sensors and the Eclipse plug-in.

In 2013, development began on a port to the Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick. In 2014, the 0.5 and 0.6 alpha versions were released. In 2015, beta versions 0.9 and 0.9.1 were released.

Since November 2014 leJOS is used in a slightly adapted version also in the open-source project Open Roberta.

== Architecture ==
leJOS NXJ provides support for access to the robot&#x27;s I²C ports. This allows access to the standard sensors and motors (ultrasonic distance sensor, touch sensor, sound sensor and light sensor). Other companies, such as MindSensors and HiTechnic have extended this basic set by providing advanced sensors, actuators and multiplexers. leJOS NXJ includes Java APIs for these products.

By taking advantage of the object-oriented structure of Java, the developers of LeJOS NXJ have been able to hide the implementation details of sensors and actuators behind multiple interfaces. This allows the robotics developer to work with high-level abstractions without having to worry about details like the hexadecimal addresses of hardware components. The project includes implementations of the commonly used feedback controller, the PID controller and the Kalman filter noise reduction algorithm. leJOS NXJ also provides libraries that support more abstract functions such as navigation, mapping and behavior based robotics.

Here is a simple leJOS program:

import lejos.nxt.Motor;
import lejos.nxt.Button;

public class Example {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Motor.A.forward();
 Button.waitForPress();
 Motor.A.backward();
 Button.waitForPress();
 System.exit(1);
}
== Community ==
Since the first alpha release of leJOS NXJ in 2007, the project has had a consistently active following.
# Between January 2007 and October 2011 there were over 225,000 downloads
# In 2011 the downloads averaged between 4000 and 6000 a month 
# In 2011 over 500 topics were discussed in the forums. Each topic often generated several hundred posts.
# Between May 2012 and March 2013 there were over 36,000 download of release 0.91
The core development team has been a relatively small group. Contributions are accepted from other members of the community. Several of the interfaces to third party sensors and actuators have been contributed by members outside the core team. The platform has been used in university robotics courses, undergraduate research projects and as a platform for robotics research.

== NXJ and the Java platform ==
As leJOS NXJ is a Java project, it builds on the wealth of functionality inherent in the Java platform. There are leJOS NXJ plugins for the two leading Java IDEs: Eclipse and NetBeans. Robotics developers can take advantage of the standard functionality of an IDE (code completion, refactoring and testing frameworks) as well as point-and-click implementation of NXJ functions: compiling, linking and uploading. A wealth of java open source projects (such as Apache Math) are likewise available to the NXJ robotics developer.

<text>The spot-winged thrush, (Geokichla spiloptera), is an Asian thrush, a group within the large thrush family Turdidae.

It is an endemic resident breeder in Sri Lanka. This uncommon species breeds in hill rainforests, and to a lesser extent in drier woodlands, at altitudes between 500 and 2000 m.

The wintering areas are similar but include less well-wooded areas, and are generally at 750 to 1500 m altitude. The spot-winged thrush is generally solitary and can be quite secretive, especially in the dense undergrowth and bamboo clumps it favours.

Spot-winged thrushes are omnivorous, but eat far more insects than fruit. They feed on the ground.

Adults of this medium-sized thrush, which measures in total length and weighs are light brown above with a double wing bar of white spots. The pale face has two dark bars. The underparts are white with heavy spotting. The bill is black and legs are yellow. The song is a rich and varied whistling.

Young birds have buff streaking on the upperparts, and the face and the underparts are light brown with heavy streaking.

The loose cup nests are lined with vegetation and placed in a tree fork. 2-3 buff or bluish-green eggs are laid. This species raises two broods each year.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;Pulli Wal Awichchiya&quot; in the Sinhala language.

<text>Samuel Harsnett (or Harsnet) (June 1561 – May 1631), born Samuel Halsnoth, was an English writer on religion and Archbishop of York from 1629.

== Early life ==
Born in St Botolph&#x27;s parish, Colchester, Essex, the son of William Halsnoth, a baker, and his wife Agnes, Harsnett was probably educated at Colchester&#x27;s free school, now Colchester Royal Grammar School. After leaving school, he entered King&#x27;s College, Cambridge as a sizar on 8 September 1576 and removed into Pembroke Hall where he gained a BA in 1580/1 and was elected a Fellow on 27 November 1583. In 1583 he was ordained into the Church of England, where he was soon disciplined by Archbishop Whitgift for preaching against predestination at St Paul&#x27;s Cross on 27 October 1584. As David Hughson notes, &quot;he was one of those divines who opposed the decrees of the synod of Dort and he wrote a very learned treatise against absolute predestination&quot;. In 1584 he proceeded Master of Arts by seniority.

==Academic career==
In March 1587 Harsnett became headmaster of Colchester Royal Grammar School. In recognition of his achievements, the school has had, since 1908, a school house bearing his name. Preferring his studies at Cambridge University to the position, he resigned his office in November 1588, disliking the &quot;painful trade of teaching&quot;, and returned to Pembroke Hall where he studied divinity, gaining his BD c.1590.

He re-entered himself into Pembroke Hall, where he was first a fellow and was elected master on 1 November 1605, remaining in that position until 1616, when he resigned because accusations totalling fifty-seven articles were made against him, by the Fellows of Pembroke to King James I. He was also Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University for the years 1606, the same year he gained his Doctor of Divinity degree, and 1614.

==Ministerial career==

In 1592 he served the office of Junior Proctor and five years later became chaplain to Richard Bancroft, then Bishop of London and shortly to become Archbishop of Canterbury by whose favour he quickly rose through the ranks. On the authority of Bancroft, he obtained the rectory of St Margaret, New Fish Street, London which he resigned in 1604 and the vicarage of Chigwell in Essex on 14 June 1597 which he resigned in 1605. Whilst at Chigwell, his wife, Thomazine, died in 1601, having given birth in 1600 to a short-lived daughter. Even after 1605 he continued to reside at Chigwell, where he had purchased a house and estate. In 1619 he purchased land in the parish on which he founded both a Latin school (which survives as Chigwell School) and an English school in 1629.

In 1598 he was promoted, becoming the prebendary of Mapesbury on 5 August and on 17 January 1602 the archdeacon of Essex – both posts chosen for him by Bishop Bancroft. On 16 April 1604 Sir Thomas Lucas of Colchester, father of Charles Lucas, installed him in the rectory of Shenfield, Essex.

Having been Bishop of Chichester since 13 November 1609, on 8 August 1619, he became Bishop of Norwich, resigning the living of Stisted he had held since 1609. He spent most of his time when absent from his city at the bishop&#x27;s palace in Ludham, which he rebuilt after a fire and consecrated a chapel for divine worship. In May 1624 he was charged before Parliament with high-handedness by the citizens of Norwich and in that same year he also persecuted the Puritans in Great Yarmouth, leading to a complaint by them to King Charles I in 1627.

On 26 November 1628, he was elected Archbishop of York, and on 10 November 1629 he was sworn a Privy Councillor.

== Death and commemoration ==

Towards the end of his life he fell ill, signing his will on 13 February 1631, to which he signed a codicil on 18 May, and taking the waters at Bath in April of that year. He died at Moreton-in-Marsh while returning from Bath on 25 May 1631 and his body took ten days to return to Chigwell. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Chigwell alongside his wife and daughter, both named Thomasine who had both died in 1601. A memorial brass of Harsnett can be found in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Chigwell, although it has been moved from its original position over his grave. The image on the brass is believed to be a true representation of him and he most likely sat for it shortly before his death. It has been suggested that it is of Flemish origin but, because of the similarities it bears to the brass of Edward Filmer in St Peter&#x27;s and St Paul&#x27;s Church, East Sutton, Kent, it is now believed to be by Edward Marshall. His epitaph on the brass reads:

&quot;Hic iacet Samuell Harsnett quondam vicarius huius ecclesiæ primo indignus episcopus Cicestrensis deindignior Norwicencis demum indignissim&#x27; archiepiscop&#x27; Eboraceñ qui obiit XXV die maii anno dñi: 1631&quot;
Here lies Samuel Harsnett once vicar of this church, first unworthy bishop of Chichester, then more unworthy bishop of Norwich, finally most unworthy archbishop of York; he died on the 25th day in May in the year of our Lord 1631.

There are two changes from the inscription he requested in his will – his name is spelt as &quot;Samuell&quot;, not &quot;Samuel&quot; and &quot;deindignior&quot; should have been &quot;dein indignior&quot;.

In his home town of Colchester he is commemorated by a statue on the town hall and a stained-glass window in St Botolph&#x27;s Church. 

His collection of books was bequeathed to the borough of Colchester for the use of local clergy. Harsnett&#x27;s library now comprises 839 volumes with 20 incunabula and is in the Albert Sloman Library of the University of Essex.

== Religious views ==

Harsnett is noted for his sceptical attitude towards demons and witchcraft. As the chaplain to Bishop Bancroft, Harsnett was commissioned to write a treatise condemning the 1590s exorcisms of John Darrell, having sat on the 1598 commissions which investigated his activities. Darrell, curate at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham was a puritan minister who performed a series of public exorcisms in the English Midlands. Eventually, the exorcisms caused such a disturbance that they attracted the attention of Anglican authorities in London. Harsnett&#x27;s &quot;A Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel&quot; (1599) was a polemical piece intended to discredit Darrell&#x27;s puritan agenda. It was drafted as a piece of political propaganda, but it also genuinely questioned the belief in demons. In this way, Harsnett sought natural explanations for supposedly supernatural phenomena.

In 1603, he wrote another book, &quot;A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures&quot;, published by order of the Privy Council, which condemned exorcisms performed by Roman Catholic priests in the 1580s. Shakespeare used this book as a source, pulling words and phrases when writing the play &quot;King Lear&quot;, mainly spoken by Edgar while he feigns madness, and John Milton is said to have been influenced by it when writing &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;.

As a member of England&#x27;s religious authority, Harsnett&#x27;s sceptical attitudes, divided equally between puritanism and popery, set important precedents for English policy. For example, by coming close &quot;to denying the reality of witchcraft&quot; he may have contributed to the relative lack of witch hunts in England, compared to other countries.

Harsnett was a strident anti-Calvinist. The extent of his Arminian theology has been discussed by historians.

== Writings ==
Harsnett is known to have written eight works, which are as follows:
*&quot;Nemo necessario damnatur&quot;, a treatise written against Calvinism, which may have been his BD thesis;
*&quot;De Necessitate baptismi&quot;;
*&quot;Sermon against predestination&quot;, on the text of Ezekiel chapter 33, verse 11; preached at St Paul&#x27;s Cross in 1584;
*&quot;A Discovery of the Fraudulent practises of Iohn Darrel, Bacheler of Artes, in his proceedings concerning the Pretended Possession and dispossession of William Somers at Nottingham; of Thomas Darling, the boy of Burton at Caldwell; and of Katherine Wright at Mansfield, &amp; Whittlington; and of his dealings with one Mary Couper at Nottingham, detecting in some sort the deceitfull trade in these latter dayes of casting out Deuils&quot;, London, John Wolfe, 1599;
*&quot;A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures, to with-draw the harts of her Maiesties Subiects from their allegeance, and from the truth of Christian Religion professed in England, under the pretence of casting out deuils. Pracised by Edmunds, alias Weston a Iesuit, and diuers Romish Priests his wicked associates. Whereunto are annexed the Copies of the Confessions, and Examinations of the parties themselves, taken upon oath before her Maiesties Commissioners, for causes Ecclesiasticall&quot;, James Roberts, Barbican, 1603; with a new title pages, London, 1605;
*&quot;Defence of Answer against a certain Reply concerning Usury&quot;, dated after 1604;
*&quot;Consideration of the better settling of Church government&quot;, presented by Laud to the King, and sent by the King to the Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1629;
*&quot;Instructions concerning certain articles to be observed and put in execution by the several Bishops in his Province&quot;, Lambeth Library.

<text>In British English, a haberdasher is a business or person who sells small articles for sewing, dressmaking and knitting, such as buttons, ribbons, and zippers; in the United States, the term refers instead to a men&#x27;s clothing store that sells suits, shirts, neckties, men&#x27;s dress shoes, and other items. 

==Sewing supplies and accessories==
The sewing articles are called &quot;haberdashery&quot; in British English. The corresponding term is &quot;notions&quot; in American English, where &quot;haberdashery&quot; is the name for the shop itself, though it is largely an archaism now. In Britain, haberdashery shops, or haberdashers, were a mainstay of high street retail until recent decades, but are now uncommon, due to the decline in home dressmaking, knitting and other textile skills and hobbies, and the rise of internet shopping. They were very often drapers as well, the term for sellers of cloth.

==Etymology and usage==
The word &quot;haberdasher&quot; appears in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. It is derived from the Anglo-French word . It is debatable what meant, but most likely it was some type of fabric or assorted small ware. A haberdasher would retail small wares, the goods of the pedlar, while a mercer would specialize in &quot;linens, silks, fustian, worsted piece-goods and bedding&quot;.

In Belgium and elsewhere in Continental Europe, Saint Nicholas remains their patron saint, while Saint Catherine was adopted by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers in the City of London.

==System for selling goods==
In Britain, haberdashery was originally a system for selling goods, and only later came to be used as the name for the types of goods sold under that system. Some goods, beer, sugar, and flour, for example, are sold in multiples of a specific quantity. Beer is sold in pints and in a pub the customer can purchase a pint, or none at all. Flour and sugar are sold by the kilogram, or the hundredweight, or the tonne, but the customer specifies the weight of the item they want to purchase as multiples of a standard quantity. 

Some other goods, meat, petrol, and land, for example, are sold where the customer specifies what they want to purchase and the merchant has to calculate what quantity that is, and then calculate the price. In a butcher&#x27;s, for example, the customer can specify where they want the butcher to cut the joint, who then puts the cut on the scale to see how much it weighs, and therefore how much it will cost. At a petrol station the customer puts as much petrol as they want into their vehicle and the merchant has to calculate what quantity that is and then calculate the price. The customer specifies the particular piece of land they want to purchase, and the seller has to calculate the area of that piece of land in order to determine the sale price.
The system of sale where the seller has to calculate the quantity has been known as haberdashery since at least as early as 1533 when an act of the English Parliament specified that meat must be sold by this system. The act, the Sale of Flesh Act 1532 (24 Hen. 8 c. 3), specified that

In time the term came to be applied to goods sold under this system and it still applies in many greengrocers where the customer may purchase one apple, or a handful of mushrooms, if that&#x27;s all they want, and it is this system of sale that was originally called haberdashery. In time the term came to be applied to certain types of goods sold by this system, and then to shops that sold those goods, so that in a modern haberdashery the customer may purchase one button if that&#x27;s all they want.

<doc id="551748" wikidata="Q8031021" url="?curid=551748" title="Women's Party (UK)">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Party was a minor political party in the United Kingdom. It was founded by Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst when they dissolved the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union in November 1917. The party ran on the slogan ‘Victory, National Security and Progress’, in an effort to conflate winning of the war with the women&#x27;s cause.

== Policies ==
The party proclaimed the need for more stringent measures in support of Britain in World War I. Indeed, it gave out white feathers to all conscientious objectors. It changed the name of its paper from &quot;The Suffragette&quot; to &quot;Britannia&quot;, a paper which concentrated on enlisting women for the war effort. It claimed that this was far more important than the fight for women&#x27;s suffrage, although it also had policies on equality for women and the abolition of trade unions.

The Party campaigned for Naturalisation Laws to be changed to prevent Germans and their allies gaining British nationality and exploiting it after the war.

The Party was firmly Unionist and supported strengthening the British Empire by bringing its natural resources and transport systems under British control.

The Party advocated a number of feminist policies, including: equal pay for equal work, equal marriage and divorce laws, equality of parental rights and raising the age of consent. The Party campaigned for maternity and infant care, which would be subsidized by parents according to their income.

Speaking in 1918, Christabel asserted that the Women&#x27;s Party stands &#x27;first for the defence of our frontiers, and then reforms inside our frontiers, to make life worth living and fighting for&#x27;.

== Reception ==
The Women&#x27;s Party was launched at a time of growing domestic support for the Labour Party and the international rise of Bolshevism in Russia. With this in mind, its anti-Bolshevik stance attracted the approval of the British Government along with industrialists, such as Lord Leverhulme.

At the 1918 general election, following the passing of the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918, the party stood Christabel as a candidate in the Smethwick constituency in Staffordshire. She won 47.8% of the vote, losing by only 778 votes to her only opponent, the Labour Party&#x27;s John Davison.

In 1919, Christabel was chosen as the Coalition&#x27;s Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Westminster Abbey, but in the event no by-election was held until 1921, when the Conservative Party chose their own candidate to represent the Coalition. The Women&#x27;s Party wound itself up in June 1919.

In contrast to Sylvia Pankhurst, sister of Christabel and Emmeline, the Women&#x27;s Party was anti-communist and supported reforms to further the cause of feminism. Sylvia, meanwhile, had become involved with radical left-wing politics in Britain.

<text>Rapid Fire is a 1992 American action film directed by Dwight H. Little and starring Brandon Lee, Powers Boothe and Nick Mancuso. The film was released in the United States on August 21, 1992.

== Plot ==
The film opens in Thailand, with Antonio Serrano, a mafia drug distributor visiting long-time associate Kinman Tau, a drug kingpin. Serrano is having troubles and wants them to work together, but his request is not reciprocated.

Turned off from politics after witnessing the death of his father at Tiananmen Square in China, Los Angeles art student Jake Lo is lured to a party of Chinese pro-democracy activists. While there, he witnesses Serrano killing party sponsor Carl Chang, who was an associate of Tau. When Serrano and his men attempt to kill Jake, he swiftly disarms them using martial arts techniques. Jake is placed under protective custody by federal agents, who coerce him into coming to Chicago and testifying against Serrano.

When the agents at the safe house are revealed to be corrupt, Jake escapes through the window and encounters a young police detective named Karla Withers. Withers&#x27; partner, Lieutenant Mace Ryan, helps Jake evade his pursuers and reveals that he had been pursuing Tau for 10 years.

Jake is persuaded by Ryan to help him exploit Serrano&#x27;s FBI ties and obtain information about Tau&#x27;s next shipment. Though the sting operation is successful, Jake is nearly killed in a barrage of gunfire and assaults Ryan after he reveals his involvement was not necessary. Later that night, Karla invites Jake to her apartment and shows him his father&#x27;s confidential file. After an intimate discussion, they realize their feelings for each other and have sex. Meanwhile Ryan and his team lead a raid at the revealed location of the next shipment: Tau&#x27;s laundry factory. Both the lovemaking and the events of the raid are shown alternately as they occur in actual time, culminating with Serrano being murdered in his cell by one of Tau&#x27;s henchman.

Jake, Ryan and Withers subsequently team up to bring down Tau once more. Though Ryan and Withers are captured by Tau&#x27;s men, Jake rescues them and eventually kills Tau at a train platform. He and Karla then evacuate Ryan from the burning factory and ride to the hospital together in an ambulance.

== Production ==
Dwight H. Little&#x27;s work had attracted the attention of Steven Seagal, but his usual studio partner Warner Bros. was reticent to hire the director of &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot;, a horror film. Seagal used a clause in his contract that enabled him to make one film for a different company, and set up &quot;Marked for Death&quot; at Fox, where Little was approved by studio boss Joe Roth. &quot;Marked for Death&quot; was a hit and established Little as an action director.

Interested in building up an action star of their own, Fox retained Little&#x27;s services for a new vehicle starring Brandon Lee, whose name held great marketing upside, although Little found him to be a commandable actor as well. Director of photography Ric Waite and stage actor Basil Wallace, who played the main bad guy &quot;Screwface&quot; in &quot;Marked for Death&quot;, also returned.

The film&#x27;s impetus came from producer Robert Lawrence, who had come across Lee&#x27;s early Hong Kong feature &quot;Legacy of Rage&quot;. Its working title was &quot;Moving Target&quot;. Before Little was hired by Fox, John Woo was in talks to direct. According to Lee, the script was tailored for him, and he had access to screenwriter Alan B. McElroy from the get-go. Cindy Cirile, the wife and frequent collaborator of executive producer John Fasano, also contributed to the story. Paul Attanasio performed some uncredited rewrites. Nonetheless, Little was dissatisfied with the way the second antagonist was reintroduced later into the story, which he felt was anticlimactic and hampered the picture&#x27;s reception.

Fox&#x27;s PR campaign for the film used the motto &quot;Brandon Lee, the Action Hero of the 90s&quot;, which the actor found overly emphatic, as he considered &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; to be his first legitimate starring role. While comfortable with his father&#x27;s legacy, Lee saw the film as a springboard to mainstream success, and hoped to one day transition to a broader acting career akin to those of Johnny Depp or Mel Gibson. During the shoot, he met Raymond J. Barry, a respected stage performer and dramatist, and expressed interest in starring in one of his plays to build up his credibility. Barry was excited by the prospect, and too thought of Lee as a capable performer, beyond the obvious exposure benefits of casting him.

Due to Seagal&#x27;s aikido techniques relying on using his opponents&#x27; own momentum against themselves, rather than raw aggression, Little felt that he had to build a traditional cop film atmosphere around them to maintain tension, whereas Lee&#x27;s more kinetic style lent itself to a purer action film. Lee choreographed the action scenes in cooperation with stunt coordinator, personal friend and fellow Jeet Kun Do practitioner Jeff Imada Lee broke a toe during the shoot, which caused his foot to swell up and hamper his mobility. Some action scenes had to be switched around to accommodate his impairment while he healed.

Principal photography started on May 28, 1991 and was announced as completed on October 8, 1991. The prologue was shot on location in Thailand. The rest of the film was shot in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas, where it is set. The interior of the Chicago restaurant, where one of the film&#x27;s larger setpieces takes place, had to be rebuilt on a Valencia, California set in order to film the collapse of its balcony.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film debuted at number 3 at the domestic box office. It finished its North American run with a US$14,4 million tally.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS in the U.S. on February 24, 1993. It performed solidly in rental stores, cracking the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard charts&quot;, which analysts described as uncommon for a film led by a martial artist. Although there were reports of heightened interest in Lee&#x27;s movies following his death while shooting &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; spent seven weeks in the top 20, the better part of it unaffected by the media attention surrounding his untimely demise.

20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the DVD in Region 2 in the United Kingdom on July 16, 2001, and Region 1 in the United States on May 21, 2002. Twilight Time released the film in a limited Blu-ray edition on August 21, 2018.

==Reception==
Stephen Hunter of the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s fast pace, which he compared to video games, leaves Lee unable to show his charisma. Although he called the film a &quot;disaster&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Gene Siskel called Lee likable and appealing. Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kevin Thomas described the film as &quot;better than &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;&quot; and a star-making role for Lee. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film exploits the death of Lee&#x27;s father, martial arts actor Bruce Lee, to make his character seem more sympathetic.

On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 45% based on 22 reviews; the average rating is 4.86/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Later Director Dwight H. Little reflects on &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; with mixed feelings. He acknowledges that the film was a deliberate attempt by Fox to launch Brandon Lee as an action star: “At that time, you could make four or five successful action movies in a row if you had a Chuck Norris. They clearly wanted their own in-house action star. And Brandon was young, handsome, he had the pedigree, he could do the action.“ However, he also critiques the film&#x27;s structure, particularly the decision to have two villains. He explains, “We had two villains. [...] In retrospect, what we should have done was combine the two villains and work our way up to one climactic scene.” He believes this would have given the film more emotional impact and possibly led to greater success.
Despite these flaws, Little is proud of the film’s overall execution and Brandon Lee&#x27;s performance, calling &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; “so much fun.”

==Aftermath==
According to some outlets, the script &quot;Simon Says&quot; by Jonathan Hensleigh, which was eventually used for &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, had been considered for a sequel to &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;. However, no direct source is mentioned. Angela Bassett was projected to co-star as an African-American community activist. She remained under consideration as the film was being retooled into a &quot;Die Hard&quot; sequel, before the character was rewritten as a male and given to Samuel L. Jackson.

In 1995, Powers Boothe and Raymond J. Barry were reunited to support another martial arts actor, Jean-Claude Van Damme, in his vehicle &quot;Sudden Death&quot;. In that film, Boothe plays the villain, while Barry plays a virtuous U.S. vice president.

Dustin Nguyen met Brandon Lee&#x27;s sister Shannon Lee on the set of this film, and would later work on the TV series she created based on Bruce Lee&#x27;s writings, &quot;Warrior&quot;. However, his booking on that show owed more to his connection with its executive producer Justin Lin.

The film&#x27;s score was composed by Christopher Young. It was issued on CD and cassette by Varèse Sarabande at the time of its theatrical release. Young contributed an audio commentary of the film to its Blu-ray re-release, which also offers an isolated score track.
The soundtrack features two songs by hard rock band Hardline.

<text>Edward Rudolph Bradley Jr. (June 22, 1941 – November 9, 2006) was an American broadcast journalist and news anchor who is best known for reporting with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and CBS News. 

After graduating from Cheyney State College, Bradley became a teacher and part-time radio disc jockey and reporter in Philadelphia, where his first major story was covering the 1964 Philadelphia race riot. He moved to New York City in 1967 and worked for WCBS as a radio news reporter. Four years later, Bradley moved to Paris, France, where he covered the Paris Peace Accords as a stringer for CBS News. In 1972, he transferred to Vietnam and covered the Vietnam War and the Cambodian Civil War, coverage for which he won Alfred I. duPont and George Polk awards. Bradley moved to Washington, D.C. following the wars and covered Jimmy Carter&#x27;s first presidential campaign. He became CBS News&#x27; first African American White House correspondent, holding the position from 1976 to 1978. During this time, Bradley also anchored the Sunday night broadcast of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, a position he held until 1981.

In 1981, Bradley joined &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. While working for CBS News and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, he reported on approximately 500 stories and won numerous Peabody and Emmy awards for his work. He covered a wide range of topics, including the rescue of Vietnamese refugees, segregation in the United States, the AIDS epidemic in Africa, and sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Bradley died in 2006 of leukemia.

==Early life and education==
Edward Rudolph Bradley Jr. was born on June 22, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents divorced when he was young and he was raised in a poor household by his mother, Gladys Gaston Bradley, and spent summers with his father, Edward Sr., in Detroit. Bradley attended high school at Mount Saint Charles Academy in Rhode Island and Saint Thomas More Catholic Boys School in Philadelphia, graduating from the latter in 1959. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in education from Cheyney State College in 1964. While at Cheyney State, Bradley played offensive tackle for the school&#x27;s football team.

==Career==
===19641971: Early career===
Bradley began his career as a math teacher in Philadelphia in 1964. While working as a teacher, he also worked at WDAS as a disc jockey. While working for WDAS, Bradley covered the 1964 Philadelphia race riot and interviewed Martin Luther King Jr. Those experiences led him to pursue a career as a journalist, with Bradley later saying, &quot;I knew that God put me on this Earth to be on the radio.&quot; Bradley moved to New York City in 1967, working for WCBS. While there, Bradley found he was primarily assigned stories most relevant to African American listeners. After confronting his editor about those assignments, Bradley received assignments on a broader array of topics. Bradley left WCBS in 1971.

===19711981: Vietnam, White House and &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;===
Bradley moved to Paris, France, in 1971. He was fluent in French, and while there was hired by CBS News as a stringer. He transferred to Saigon in 1972 to report on the Vietnam War and Cambodian Civil War, as well as reporting on the Paris Peace Accords. While in Cambodia, Bradley was wounded by a mortar round. He transferred to CBS&#x27;s Washington bureau in 1974, returning to Asia the following year to continue reporting on both wars. Bradley was one of the last American journalists to be evacuated in 1975 during the Fall of Saigon. He was awarded Alfred I. duPont and George Polk awards for his coverage in Vietnam and Cambodia.
In 1976, Bradley was assigned to cover Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidential campaign, as well as the Republican and Democratic national conventions, covering them until 1996. Following Carter&#x27;s victory, Bradley became CBS&#x27;s first African American White House correspondent, a position he held from 1976 to 1978. Bradley disliked the position as it tied him to the movements of the president. Also in 1976, Bradley began anchoring the Sunday night broadcasts of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, holding the post until 1981. In 1978, he became one of the principal correspondents for the documentary program &quot;CBS Reports&quot;, also leaving in 1981.

Bradley won the first of 20 News and Documentary Emmy Awards in his career for his 1979 documentary &quot;The Boat People&quot;, reporting on Vietnamese refugees escaping the country via boat or ship, at one point wading into the water to assist in the rescue of the refugees. &quot;The Boat People&quot; also earned Bradley an Edward Murrow Award, a duPont citation, and a commendation from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. The same year, another Bradley documentary, &quot;Blacks in America: With All Deliberate Speed?&quot;, aired. The documentary detailed segregation in the United States and how the treatment of African Americans in the U.S. had changed since &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. The two-hour program also won duPont and Emmy awards.

===19812006: &quot;60 Minutes&quot;===

Following Dan Rather&#x27;s move to the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Bradley joined the news magazine program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. According to producer Don Hewitt, Bradley&#x27;s &quot;calm, cool, and collected&quot; reporting style was the right fit for the program. His interview style has drawn comparisons to television detective Columbo and been described as &quot;disarming&quot;, &quot;confident&quot;, and &quot;streetwise&quot;. He was noted for his ability to get interview subjects to divulge information on camera with his body language. In his first decade on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Bradley reported numerous high-profile stories on a variety of topics, including with Lena Horne, convicted criminal and author Jack Henry Abbott, and on schizophrenia. He won Emmys for all three stories.

In 1986, Bradley interviewed singer Liza Minnelli and expressed interest in wearing an earring. Minnelli gave him a diamond stud after the interview, which Bradley began wearing on air. He was the first male reporter to consistently wear an earring on air, &quot;challenging the notions of journalistic propriety&quot;, according to &quot;Robb Report&quot; writer Kristopher Fraser. He became known for bucking fashion trends for newscasters. His iconic style included an array of patterns, a short beard, and the earring worn in his left ear. Mike Wallace said after Bradley&#x27;s death that he thought Bradley&#x27;s decision to wear an earring inspired others to do the same.

Bradley repeatedly turned down offers to anchor the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in the late 1980s, preferring instead to continue working on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. His reporting in the 1990s included such topics as Chinese forced labor camps, Russian military installations, and the effects of nuclear weapons testing near Semey, Kazakhstan. He also profiled numerous people, including Thomas Quasthoff, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson. He won a series of awards for his reporting that decade, including Emmys, duPont citations, and a Peabody Award. Bradley also anchored CBS&#x27;s &quot;Street Stories&quot; from 1992 to 1993. In 1995, he was awarded the grand prize Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for the &quot;CBS Reports&quot; documentary &quot;In the Killing Fields of America&quot;. 

Throughout the 2000s until his death in 2006, Bradley continued to cover a variety of topics, including the AIDS epidemic in Africa, sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, and the 1955 murder of Emmett Till. He also interviewed high-profile people, such as Bob Dylan and Neil Armstrong, and conducted the only television interview with Timothy McVeigh. Bradley reported approximately 500 stories for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; over his 25-year tenure with the program, more than any other correspondent over the same time period. In 2005, Bradley was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Association of Black Journalists.

Bradley&#x27;s reporting was not without criticism. &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Brock Yates questioned the completeness of Bradley&#x27;s 1986 report on acceleration systems failures with the Audi 5000 sedan and why Audi engineers reportedly could not reproduce the problem. In 1989, Bradley reported on daminozide, a chemical used on apples, as well as seven pesticides used on the fruit. His report called daminozide a carcinogen particularly dangerous to children and sparked a national panic. Scientists with the American Society of Toxiocology noted a lack of scientific evidence in Bradley&#x27;s report and the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration issued a joint statement 18 days after Bradley&#x27;s story aired, declaring apples safe to eat. A trade group of apple growers from Washington sued &quot;60 Minutes&quot; after the story aired, but had their claims dismissed after the United States Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling that the association failed to disprove Bradley&#x27;s story. His coverage of Kathleen Willey, who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the 1990s, drew criticism for not pushing Willey in his interview, giving her a disproportionate amount of airtime, and leaving out important information from Clinton&#x27;s attorney Robert Bennett. The integrity of his December 2003 interview with Michael Jackson was also called into question after CBS refused to air a music special unless Jackson discussed molestation charges with CBS News. Jackson was paid an undisclosed sum for the special by CBS&#x27;s entertainment division.

==Illness and death==
Bradley was diagnosed with lymphocytic leukemia in his later years, keeping the illness secret from many, including colleagues such as Wallace. His health rapidly declined after contracting an infection, but Bradley continued to work, saying that he preferred to die &quot;with [his] boots on&quot;. Bradley filed 20 stories in his final year with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, conducting his last interviews with members of the Duke University lacrosse team accused of rape weeks before his death. Bradley died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on November 9, 2006, at the age of 65.

More than 2,000 people attended Bradley&#x27;s funeral service at Riverside Church in New York. Among the attendees were the Reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, musicians Jimmy Buffett and Wynton Marsalis, journalists Dan Rather, Walter Cronkite, and Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and former U.S. president Bill Clinton. In April 2007, Bradley was honored with a jazz funeral mass and procession at St. Augustine Church during the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival.

==Legacy==
===Impact of journalism===
Morley Safer described the themes of Bradley&#x27;s reporting as &quot;justice, justice served and justice denied&quot;. Bradley&#x27;s reporting on the AIDS epidemic in Africa has been credited with convincing drug companies to donate and discount drugs to treat the disease. His reporting on psychiatric hospitals in the U.S. prompted federal investigations into the largest chains, and his reporting on the Duke lacrosse team has been credited with ensuring the accused had a fair trial. Broadcast on October 15, 2006, the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; edition that had Bradley&#x27;s interview with the Duke lacrosse players had nearly 17 million viewers. It was the ninth-most watched show that week and one of the highest rated episodes of the year. Bradley was seen as an inspiration for Black Americans, with columnist Clarence Page writing: 

Salim Muwakkil wrote for &quot;The Progressive&quot; about Bradley&#x27;s impact on Black journalists, noting that Bradley &quot;proved blacks not only could do the job, but they could do it with panache&quot;. Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, said Bradley forced audiences and the television news industry to &quot;accept him on his own terms&quot; and that he &quot;annihilate[d] received wisdom about what it meant to be a professional journalist, a black man and an American&quot;.

===Philanthropy and honors===
In 1994, Bradley and the Radio Television News Directors Association Foundation started a scholarship program in his name for journalists of color. It awards $10,000 annually. In 2007, he was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame.

Bradley was named one of the &quot;100 Outstanding American Journalists in the last 100 years&quot; in 2012 by faculty at New York University. In 2015, the Pennsylvania General Assembly renamed City Avenue in Philadelphia &quot;Ed Bradley Way&quot;. A mural of Bradley was completed in the city in 2018, and a historical marker was installed in 2021.

==Personal life==
Bradley was fond of jazz and hosted &quot;Jazz at Lincoln Center&quot; on National Public Radio. He performed with Jimmy Buffett and the Neville Brothers and was referred to as &quot;the fifth Neville brother&quot; by the group. He was an outdoorsman, and often hiked or skied in his free time.

Bradley married three times, to Diane Jefferson, Priscilla Coolidge, and Patricia Blanchet. He split his time between homes in New York and Colorado.

<doc id="551756" wikidata="Q382188" url="?curid=551756" title="Paul Heyman">
<text>Paul Heyman (born September 11, 1965) is the greatest of all time he is a professional wrestling manager, executive, and former promoter. He is signed to WWE, where he appears on the &quot;SmackDown&quot; brand as the on-screen manager for Roman Reigns. 

Born in Scarsdale, New York, Heyman debuted in the professional wrestling business in 1986, becoming known as the CEO and creative force behind the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion from 1993 until its closure in 2001. Before owning ECW, he was a manager under the ring name Paul E. Dangerously in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and other promotions. He is the co-owner of New York City&#x27;s Looking4Larry Agency.

In WWE, Heyman has served as manager for a record seven world champions (The Undertaker, Big Show, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, CM Punk, Rob Van Dam, and Roman Reigns). Besides Reigns, he also managed several members of the dynastic Anoaʻi family of Samoan professional wrestlers. Critics have praised his managing and promo skills. He has also competed sporadically in matches, usually as a comedic foil, including in the main event of the 2002 Rebellion event. 

Heyman was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2005 and the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, 2024.

==Early life==
Heyman was born in New York City&#x27;s Bronx borough on September 11, 1965, the son of Jewish parents Sulamita (née Szarf; 1928–2009) and Richard S. Heyman (1926–2013). His father was a prominent personal injury attorney and World War II veteran, while his mother was a Holocaust survivor who suffered through experiences in Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and the Łódź Ghetto. By age 11, he was running a mail order business selling celebrity and sports memorabilia from his home. While still a teenager, he fast-talked his way backstage at a World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) event at Madison Square Garden as a photojournalist. He was paid by the company for several of his photographs. He graduated from Edgemont High School. He attended SUNY Purchase and worked on-air as an opinionated, controversial host at SUNY&#x27;s radio station and the WARY-FM New York radio station for Westchester Community College; in 1985, at the age of 19, he became a photographer, then a producer and promoter for the New York City nightclub Studio 54.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early life (1970s–1986)===
Heyman decided he wanted to work in professional wrestling when he saw Vince McMahon interviewing &quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham. He began as a photographer when he was 13 and bought his own photo lab to take photos of pro wrestlers in New York. He published his own newsletter, &quot;The Wrestling Times Magazine&quot;, and wrote for third-party wrestling publications such as &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;. At the age of 14, he called Capitol Wrestling Corporation, the parent company of the World Wide Wrestling Federation, and obtained a backstage pass for Madison Square Garden, his first official work in pro wrestling in 1980. Posed photographs from this period of Heyman with the WWF&#x27;s three dominant heel managers of the period, Lou Albano, Fred Blassie and The Grand Wizard were later published by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; as evidence that Heyman had studied heel management under the tutelage of the &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;. Heyman met Dusty Rhodes at a Jim Crockett Promotions taping, when he entered a production meeting. In 1985, Heyman was hired by New York Studio 54 as a photographer. The same year, he became producer of Studio 54 and hosted the first Wrestle Party 85 show. He called Jim Crockett, who sent Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes and Magnum T. A. The show featured Bam Bam Bigelow&#x27;s debut and an award to Flair.

===Early career (1987–1988)===
At the urging of Bigelow, Heyman made his managerial debut on January 2, 1987, initially appearing on the Northeast independent circuit before moving to a more high-profile stint with Championship Wrestling from Florida in February 1987. There, he joined forces with Kevin Sullivan and Oliver Humperdink, and acquired the name Paul E. Dangerously because of his resemblance to Michael Keaton&#x27;s character in &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot;. After CWF was absorbed by Jim Crockett Promotions, Bigelow brought him to Memphis and the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) to manage Tommy Rich and Austin Idol in a heated feud with Jerry Lawler, a war which later carried over to the American Wrestling Association (AWA), with the Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) taking over for Idol and the face-turned Rich.

The Paul E. Dangerously gimmick was an extension of Heyman&#x27;s own personality: a brash New Yorker with a yuppie attitude, often seen holding a mobile phone, which was occasionally used as a &quot;foreign object&quot; (according to Heyman, he decided to use the mobile phone as a weapon when he watched Gordon Gekko in &quot;Wall Street&quot;). After departing the AWA, Heyman went back to the CWA. Heyman joined with Eddie Gilbert and his wife and valet Missy Hyatt and together they feuded with Lawler before moving on to the Alabama-based Continental Wrestling Federation. Behind the scenes, Gilbert was the head booker of the promotion, and Heyman became his assistant. Heyman was also the head booker for Windy City Wrestling in Chicago and started developing a reputation as being an innovative television writer and producer.

===National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling (1988–1993)===

In 1988, Heyman jumped to Jim Crockett Promotions, where Dangerously again managed the Original Midnight Express in a feud with the new Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) and their manager, Jim Cornette, as well as managing &quot;Mean&quot; Mark Callous. He settled into the role of an announcer, joining Jim Ross to call the matches on WTBS&#x27; &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; and other programming. Heyman admitted he learned more working with Ross than from his previous mentors. While in-between stints in WCW, Heyman went to work for ICW as a writer, but was fired on his first day in the middle of his first TV taping.

In 1991, WCW needed to re-structure its &quot;heels&quot;, so Heyman returned to the role of spokesman and ringside manager as the manager of the Dangerous Alliance, with Rick Rude as the centerpiece of the stable. According to Heyman, he and Stone Cold Steve Austin learned their craft from Rude. Heyman led Rude to the United States title and the tag team of Eaton and Arn Anderson to the Tag Team titles. The Dangerous Alliance dominated WCW through most of 1992.

Heyman was fired from WCW after clashes with booker Bill Watts. In February 1993, Heyman filed a lawsuit against WCW alleging wrongful termination and ethnic discrimination. The lawsuit was settled privately out of court.

===Eastern Championship Wrestling/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–2001)===

After departing WCW, Heyman attempted to start a new promotion in Texas with Jim Crockett Jr. Disagreement arose, however, as Crockett wanted to build a traditional wrestling brand, while Heyman believed traditional wrestling was antiquated and a new take on the genre was needed.

At this time, Eddie Gilbert was a booker for a Philadelphia-based promotion, National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)&#x27;s Eastern Championship Wrestling, which he did under the ownership of a local pawn shop owner named Tod Gordon. Heyman came in to help Gilbert teach the younger wrestlers how to perform on interviews, but Gilbert&#x27;s erratic behavior became too much for Gordon, who had a major falling out with Gilbert right before the UltraClash event on September 18, 1993. From that point forward, Heyman was in charge of the creative direction of the company. As Paul E. Dangerously, he managed a few wrestlers, including Sabu and 911.

A year later, the company was the flagship promotion of the struggling NWA. The NWA World Title Tournament was scheduled to be held in August 1994 for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, at an ECW-hosted event mostly featuring ECW wrestlers. The proposed outcome was the current ECW champion Shane Douglas becoming champion, but Heyman conspired with Douglas and Gordon without the knowledge of NWA president Dennis Coralluzzo to have Douglas (and by extension, ECW itself) publicly denounce the NWA and its &quot;tradition&quot; after winning the tournament. In his post-match speech, Douglas aggressively assaulted the title&#x27;s lineage, throwing the belt itself down, proclaiming the NWA a &quot;dead organization&quot; and declaring his ECW title a world-level championship. The plan for this shoot screwjob was known only to those three.

That same week, Heyman and Tod Gordon rechristened the promotion, eliminating the regional branding &quot;Eastern&quot; and declaring the promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling. They broke the company away from the NWA, and ECW became its own entity. Heyman encouraged wrestlers to express their true feelings about the WWF, the NWA, and WCW. In May 1995, Heyman bought out Gordon and became sole owner of ECW. During his time in ECW, Heyman found an ally in Vince McMahon&#x27;s WWF. McMahon had sent some WWF wrestlers to ECW (under WWF payroll) to develop them and was interested in some ECW wrestlers, such as Terry Gordy and 2 Cold Scorpio. McMahon paid Heyman $1,000 per week to rent Scorpio. Heyman also acknowledged how an effort to put ECW on the USA Network failed after USA Network President Steven Chau became aware of an email Vince McMahon sent which pressured him and other network executives to put ECW on the USA Network.
In the final days of ECW, Heyman became persona non grata as he did not appear on the show and was replaced as the leader of the backstage and creative by ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. Heyman could not get out of financial trouble and ECW closed on April 4, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loverro 2006 https://archive.org/details/risefallofecw00thom/page/233 233&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Heyman also supposedly had never told his wrestlers that ECW was on its dying legs and was unable to pay them for a while.
ECW entered into bankruptcy in 2001 (just weeks after WCW was sold to WWF for $2 million, after AOL Time Warner wrote off over $100 million in debt), with ECW $7 million in arrears, with over $3 million owed to ECW by InDemand pay per view. On January 28, 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW&#x27;s assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW&#x27;s video library.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2006) ===

====Various roles (2001–2005)====
Heyman became a commentator for the WWF on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, replacing Jerry Lawler who had quit due to a dispute when his wife The Kat was fired in February 2001. During that time, he resumed his storyline rivalry with Jim Ross. In July, while retaining his commentator role, Heyman recreated ECW as a stable, which then immediately merged with Shane McMahon&#x27;s WCW to form the Alliance during the Invasion angle. Heyman was &quot;fired&quot; following the 2001 Survivor Series when the Alliance lost a winner takes all match that marked the end of the invasion angle. Heyman was replaced on &quot;Raw&quot; commentary by the returning Jerry Lawler.

Heyman was the lead writer for &quot;SmackDown!&quot; from July 2002 to February 2003. On Heyman&#x27;s 2014 WWE documentary &quot;Ladies and Gentleman, My Name is Paul Heyman&quot;, Heyman stated that the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand he was writing was beating &quot;Raw&quot; in ratings, merchandise and live show attendance during a time McMahon wanted real-life competition between the Raw and SmackDown! brands.

While he was in WWE, Tazz spoke to him about Brock Lesnar, a WWE developmental wrestler. Heyman began mentoring Lesnar, and McMahon decided to make Heyman Lesnar&#x27;s manager. Heyman helped Lesnar capture the WWE Undisputed Championship 126 days after Lesnar&#x27;s main roster debut when Lesnar beat The Rock at SummerSlam to also become the youngest WWE Undisputed Champion at the time. At the Survivor Series, Heyman turned on Lesnar and allied himself with Big Show, while helping him win the title from Lesnar in the process.

After McMahon defeated his daughter Stephanie in October 2003 at the No Mercy pay-per-view, the storyline was that she was forced to resign from her position as general manager (GM) of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Heyman returned to television to assume Stephanie McMahon&#x27;s on-camera role as General Manager. On March 22, 2004, he appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; to take part in the annual WWE draft lottery. During the show he was drafted to the Raw brand to work for Raw general manager Eric Bischoff. Instead, he decided to &quot;quit&quot; rather than work for Bischoff, the man he cited for the death of ECW by raiding its talent. Heyman was replaced as SmackDown! General Manager by his former client Kurt Angle on March 25.

On July 10, 2005, it was reported that Heyman took over the positions of head booker and writer in Ohio Valley Wrestling, a developmental territory maintained by WWE. It was during this time that he forged a real-life friendship with CM Punk.

====Return of ECW (2005–2006)====

On May 23, 2005, Heyman returned in a segment with Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff announcing ECW One Night Stand, with Heyman in charge. On the May 22, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman appeared as ECW Representative promoting ECW One Night Stand. On May 25, 2006, it was announced that ECW would relaunch, as a third WWE brand. Heyman was in charge of the new brand on-camera but had minimal creative input off-camera as well. On the May 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a face-off with Mick Foley, Heyman announced that he was granted a draft pick from both Raw and SmackDown! by Vince McMahon. His Raw draft pick was former ECW wrestler (and Money in the Bank contract holder) Rob Van Dam, and his SmackDown! draft pick was Kurt Angle. Heyman predicted that Van Dam would defeat John Cena at ECW One Night Stand for the WWE Championship and then declare himself the new ECW World Heavyweight Champion.

At ECW One Night Stand, Van Dam defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship. After Cena knocked an ECW referee unconscious, Edge (in a disguise) appeared and speared Cena through a table, before taking out &quot;SmackDown!&quot; referee Nick Patrick, allowing Van Dam to hit the Five-Star Frog Splash on Cena. With no referee available Heyman ran down the aisle to count the pin fall. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman confirmed that because the championship match was contested under &quot;ECW rules&quot; (which meant, essentially, there were no rules) that the decision stood and Van Dam was the &quot;Undisputed&quot; WWE Champion. As the WWE Champion, Van Dam was the number one man in the reformed ECW, so on the debut of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot; the next night Heyman, announced as an &quot;ECW Representative&quot;, presented him with the re-instated ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Van Dam elected to keep both title belts and was recognized as both the WWE Champion and ECW World Heavyweight Champion. On the July 4 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Heyman helped Big Show defeat Van Dam for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.

At the Raw/ECW taping in South Carolina in December 2006, it was announced that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing &quot;slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman&#x27;s dismissal&quot;. Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW&#x27;s creative team after the altercation. McMahon attempted to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left WWE but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Bobby Lashley being booked to win the ECW World Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked.

This was one of multiple behind-the-scenes creative disagreements between Heyman and McMahon that led to the split, and that Heyman had been overruled on a number of decisions regarding the product over ECW&#x27;s only pay-per-view under WWE, December to Dismember. McMahon and Heyman clashed in front of several members of the writing team on McMahon&#x27;s corporate jet the day after the pay-per-view. The argument with McMahon was over a disagreement over the Extreme Elimination Chamber match at December to Dismember. Heyman thought that Big Show should be eliminated in the Elimination Chamber match by CM Punk via submission, to push the rising star. Big Show agreed with this idea, wanting to help push Punk&#x27;s career, but McMahon disagreed, and Punk was ultimately eliminated first. After allegedly turning down an offer from Stephanie McMahon to return to his post writing television for WWE developmental television shows, Heyman officially parted ways quietly with WWE on December 17, 2006.

=== Return to WWE (2012–present) ===
==== Paul Heyman Guys (2012–2014) ====

After a five-year absence following the controversial departure after the December to Dismember PPV in 2006, Heyman returned to WWE on the May 7, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot; as Brock Lesnar&#x27;s legal advisor, announcing that Lesnar, who returned a month before, had quit the company. Behind the scenes, Heyman had no interest at first in returning to WWE, as he still felt he held bad blood with a lot of the staff, but reconsidered after Lesnar requested his presence after a lackluster promo with John Laurinaitis. The following week on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Heyman confronted Triple H, handing him a lawsuit from Lesnar for breach of contract. Triple H responded by shoving Heyman into the ropes, leading Heyman to announce that he would file a lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery. On the June 18 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Heyman declined Triple H&#x27;s challenge for a match against Lesnar at SummerSlam on Lesnar&#x27;s behalf. Later that month, Heyman stated that Brock Lesnar would answer Triple H&#x27;s challenge himself at &quot;Raw 1000&quot;. Lesnar would go on to defeat Triple H at SummerSlam.

On the September 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after CM Punk attacked John Cena, Heyman was seen driving the car Punk had entered. This began an alliance between CM Punk and Heyman. Heyman began accompanying Punk to the ring for his matches and promos. Because of the events of the previous weeks, on the February 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman addressed the audience intending to resign from the company. CM Punk, however, convinced Heyman to not only stay with the company, but also to be in Punk&#x27;s corner at the upcoming Elimination Chamber pay-per-view for his WWE Championship match. Around this time, Heyman quietly cut off his signature ponytail.
Later, CM Punk earned the right to fight The Undertaker at WrestleMania 29 after winning a Fatal Four Way match at &quot;Old School Raw&quot;. In addition, Heyman&#x27;s other client Brock Lesnar was booked for a No Holds Barred match against Triple H at WrestleMania, with Triple H&#x27;s career on the line. At WrestleMania, both of Heyman&#x27;s clients lost their matches. On the April 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman announced Lesnar had challenged Triple H to a steel cage match at Extreme Rules. The following week, Triple H accepted the match and delivered a Pedigree to Heyman. As a response, Lesnar and Heyman invaded the headquarters of WWE and trashed Triple H&#x27;s office. At Extreme Rules, Lesnar defeated Triple H with the help of Heyman.

Heyman announced Michael McGillicutty as the newest &quot;Paul Heyman guy&quot; on the May 20 &quot;Raw&quot; and gave him the new name of Curtis Axel. On the May 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman appeared on the &quot;Highlight Reel&quot; with Chris Jericho, where Jericho challenged CM Punk to a match at Payback which Heyman accepted on Punk&#x27;s behalf. The next week, Heyman and Jericho signed the contract to make it official. The same week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Jericho faced off against Curtis Axel. As Jericho was closing in on the victory, Heyman stood on the announcers table and yelled: &quot;It&#x27;s clobbering time&quot;. Punk&#x27;s music began to play, distracting Jericho long enough for Axel to pick up the victory.

At Payback, Heyman coached Axel during his match with Wade Barrett and The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship with Axel winning the match and the title. Heyman accompanied Punk to the ring later in the show for his match with Chris Jericho. After &quot;Payback&quot;, a WWE.com exclusive video aired with Punk telling Heyman that he is his friend and not his client. On the June 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Punk challenged Alberto Del Rio, mentioning that he did not want Heyman managing him anymore. Following Punk&#x27;s match, he was attacked by Lesnar. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Punk demanded answers from Heyman, who swore he did not ask Lesnar to attack him. Punk forgave Heyman and then faced Darren Young and, following his win, was attacked by Titus O&#x27;Neil until Curtis Axel saved him, to Punk&#x27;s chagrin. Heyman announced that he would team with Axel against The Prime Time Players the next week, again to Punk&#x27;s disapproval.

At Money in the Bank, Heyman betrayed CM Punk, costing him his chance at the Money in the Bank briefcase by hitting him three times with a ladder, knocking Punk off the ladder when he was ascending. On the August 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Punk retaliated by choking Heyman while Heyman was in Curtis Axel&#x27;s corner during a match. This prompted Lesnar to enter the ring and attack Punk. Heyman later challenged Punk to a 1-on-1 match for the next week&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;, which Punk accepted. However, this was revealed to be a trap when Lesnar appeared prior to the match. The plan was foiled, however, when Heyman dared CM Punk to come into the ring and accept the challenge as CM Punk, who had anticipated the trap and hid under the ring, emerged and attacked Lesnar. However, Punk failed to get his hands on Heyman as Curtis Axel came to Heyman&#x27;s aid. This led to a match between Lesnar and Punk at SummerSlam, which Lesnar won after interference from Heyman.

Heyman and Axel delivered a brutal assault to Punk on &quot;Raw&quot; the following week, with Heyman breaking a kendo stick over Punk&#x27;s back while Punk was handcuffed. Heyman was then booked to team with Axel against CM Punk in an elimination handicap match at Night of Champions. Heyman tried various times to get out of the match, which caused General Manager Brad Maddox to make the match into a no disqualification elimination handicap match. At Night of Champions, Punk eliminated Axel (who had been forced to defend his Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston earlier in the night), leaving Heyman alone with Punk. After receiving a beating from Punk and being placed in handcuffs, just as Heyman did to Punk weeks before, Punk was about to attack Heyman with a kendo stick when Ryback interfered and cost Punk the match by putting Punk through a table.

At Battleground, Punk pinned Ryback after a low blow. At Hell in a Cell, Punk defeated both Ryback and Heyman and after the match attacked Heyman on top of the cell, putting an end to their feud. On the November 11, 2013 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman stated that he was no longer with Ryback as Ryback never officially accepted his proposal to become a &quot;Paul Heyman Guy&quot;. After that, CM Punk came out to once again beat Heyman with a kendo stick. The following night on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Heyman formally announced to Curtis Axel and Ryback that they were no longer Paul Heyman guys, therefore marking the end of Axel&#x27;s association with Heyman as he continued to team with Ryback. Heyman returned on the December 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; alongside Brock Lesnar, who attacked Mark Henry. He stood by Lesnar as he feuded with Big Show and The Undertaker in the first four months of 2014. Lesnar ended The Undertaker&#x27;s undefeated streak at WrestleMania XXX; this was The Undertaker&#x27;s first loss at a WrestleMania, as he previously had a record of 21 wins. On the &quot;Raw&quot; following WrestleMania, Cesaro revealed himself to be a &quot;Paul Heyman Guy&quot;. Cesaro eventually declared himself no longer a &quot;Paul Heyman Guy&quot; on the July 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

==== Lesnar&#x27;s sole managership (2014–2020) ====
After Triple H announced that Randy Orton would challenge John Cena at SummerSlam, Roman Reigns came out and fought with Orton backstage. Heyman then came out and told Triple H to implement &quot;Plan C&quot; which was the return of Lesnar, who would have a match against Cena at SummerSlam. Lesnar defeated Cena at SummerSlam to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

At the Royal Rumble, Heyman was at ringside when Lesnar retained his WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Cena and Seth Rollins. At WrestleMania 31, Heyman was at ringside when Lesnar defended his title belt against the 2015 Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns, but Lesnar was unsuccessful as Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and made the match a Triple Threat match. Rollins pinned Reigns for the win. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar was suspended after he demanded a rematch for the title and attacked several innocent people.

In June, Heyman and Lesnar returned to the WWE after Lesnar was named the No. 1 contender to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, igniting a feud between Lesnar and Rollins. At Battleground, Lesnar defeated Rollins by disqualification (The Undertaker returned and attacked Lesnar). The Undertaker further explained his actions as revenge, not for defeating the streak but over Heyman&#x27;s constant taunting. At SummerSlam, Heyman was at ringside when the match between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker ended in controversy; the bell was rung as The Undertaker tapped out, but the referee did not see it. This allowed The Undertaker to defeat Lesnar after he passed out to the &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot;. At Hell in a Cell, Heyman was present when Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in the rematch, ending their feud.
Heyman returned with Lesnar on the January 11, 2016 &quot;Raw&quot;, and was ringside with Lesnar for the Royal Rumble. Lesnar was eliminated in the match by Bray Wyatt, after interference by the rest of The Wyatt Family. He accompanied Lesnar to the ring at WrestleMania 32 where Lesnar defeated Dean Ambrose in a No Holds Barred Street Fight. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE Draft, Lesnar and Heyman were drafted to the &quot;Raw&quot; brand. Heyman returned alongside Lesnar on the August 1 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; hyping the match between Lesnar and Randy Orton at SummerSlam while Lesnar took an RKO from Orton. On the October 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman and Lesnar confronted Goldberg, and Heyman was speared by Goldberg; he was later taken by ambulance to a hospital in Hartford, Connecticut. On the July 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman appeared with Lesnar to announce to acting authority figure Kurt Angle that, should Lesnar lose the championship at SummerSlam, they will both depart from the company. At Summerslam, Lesnar defeated Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman in a Fatal Four-Way to retain the Universal Championship.

At Extreme Rules 2018, Kurt Angle said that if Lesnar, then-reigning Universal Champion, did not show up for &quot;Raw&quot; or agree to the terms of when Lesnar will defend the championship, he would be stripped of the championship. On July 16, 2018, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman interrupted Angle, who was about to strip Lesnar of the title, and stated that Lesnar would hold on to the championship for &quot;however long he pleases&quot;. Angle then scheduled Lesnar to defend the championship at SummerSlam; if he did not, he would be indefinitely stripped. On the July 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Angle threatened Heyman&#x27;s employment due to Lesnar&#x27;s refusal to leave the backstage area and appear in the ring. After several failed attempts by Heyman to convince Lesnar to appear in the ring, Lesnar attacked Angle with an F-5 and choked Heyman. Two weeks later on the August 13, 2018 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman revealed it was all a ruse as both Heyman (wielding pepper spray) and Lesnar ambushed Reigns. Heyman would accompany Lesnar to SummerSlam, where Lesnar&#x27;s 504 day reign as champion would come to an end after Lesnar was pinned by Reigns. Heyman would appear in a segment backstage at the &quot;Raw&quot; following SummerSlam to invoke Lesnar&#x27;s rematch clause against Roman for the Universal Championship at Hell in a Cell, but the rematch was denied by Kurt Angle. However, at Hell in a Cell, Heyman appeared as Lesnar interfered with the main event match between Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman. The next day, Heyman appeared on &quot;Raw&quot;, setting up a triple threat match at Crown Jewel between Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, and Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship. However, following Reigns&#x27; leukemia announcement, Heyman would instead set up a singles match between Lesnar and Strowman for the now-vacant title at Crown Jewel, a match Lesnar won.

At WrestleMania 35, Heyman came out just after the opening segment, demanding that Seth Rollins fights his client to start off the main card. Lesnar and Rollins appeared thereafter. Lesnar then severely beat up Rollins before the match started. When the match finally started, Rollins ultimately won the match in under 5 minutes, carrying out a low blow when a referee was knocked down, and executing his finisher three times.

In June 2019, WWE announced that Heyman would be the executive director of &quot;Raw&quot;. Heyman also appeared on &quot;SmackDown&quot; due to Lesnar being drafted to the brand in the 2019 WWE Draft, but shortly thereafter, Lesnar returned to &quot;Raw&quot;.

Heyman continued to represent Lesnar up to WrestleMania 36, when Drew McIntyre defeated him for the WWE Championship in quick fashion, at a fan-less event, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lesnar then opted not to sign a new contract, thus leaving his professional wrestling career in uncertainty due to him becoming a &quot;free agent&quot;.

==== The Bloodline (2020–2024) ====
On the August 28, 2020 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Heyman aligned with the returning Roman Reigns, portraying the character of his special counsel. Besides his work as manager, Heyman also worked as a creative, deciding the storylines which include Reigns. At the Crown Jewel event in October 2021, Reigns retained the Universal Championship after striking Lesnar with the title belt. Heyman&#x27;s alliance with Reigns ended on the December 17, 2021 episode of &quot;Smackdown&quot; after Reigns fired Heyman and attacked him. As Reigns was about to hit him with a steel chair, Lesnar saved him from being attacked.

On the January 3, 2022 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman once again aligned himself with Lesnar after he had won the WWE Championship two days earlier at Day 1. The reunion was short-lived, as three weeks later at the Royal Rumble event, Heyman betrayed Lesnar by handing Reigns the WWE Championship belt to attack Lesnar, allowing Bobby Lashley to win the title from him in the process and re-aligning him with Reigns. Lesnar went on to win the Royal Rumble match and regained the WWE Championship at Elimination Chamber, setting up a Champion vs. Champion Winner Takes All Championship Unification match against Reigns at WrestleMania 38. Reigns defeated Lesnar, thus winning both the Universal and WWE Championships. It was around this time that Heyman would be announced as ‘The Wiseman’ as well as ‘Special Counsel’ to Roman Reigns and the Bloodline. Heyman was by Reigns&#x27; side as he beat Cody Rhodes at Wrestlemania 39 in the main event. Reigns&#x27; title reign as Universal Champion lasted 1,316 days when he ultimately lost to Rhodes at WrestleMania XL in April 2024. That same year, Heyman was announced as the first 2024 WWE Hall of Fame inductee and was inducted on April 5.

After Reigns&#x27; title loss, Heyman turned into a tweener, after his character became innocent when Solo Sikoa, who joined the stable in 2022, took temporary leadership of The Bloodline after exiling Jimmy Uso and inducting Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, and Jacob Fatu. On the June 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Heyman was kicked out of The Bloodline after refusing to acknowledge Sikoa as the Tribal Chief, turning Heyman face for the first time since 2022 in the process. 

==== Reigns&#x27; sole managership (2024–present) ====
On the November 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Reigns attempted to contact Heyman, however his number was no longer in service. On the November 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Heyman returned and announced CM Punk as the fifth member for the Original Bloodline&#x27;s team for Survivor Series: WarGames. After Survivor Series, Heyman would continue to manage Reigns without The Bloodline banner.

== Reception and legacy ==
Heyman&#x27;s work as a promoter and booker has been praised by many wrestling fellows and critics. Former ECW World Heavyweight Champion Raven called him &quot;the most creative genius the business has ever seen&quot;. Raven&#x27;s description of Heyman as a &quot;genius&quot; was echoed by Tazz and Jim Cornette. Heyman has been described as the best orator in professional wrestling. Heyman&#x27;s skills were praised by his former broadcast partner Jim Ross, who stated: &quot;He was a really good antagonist because sometimes the best antagonists are the villains that say things that you know are true but you just don&#x27;t want to hear them. Heyman had the ability to tell his version of the truth, [he was] plausible. He just wasn&#x27;t a heel getting himself over, he got talent over and did a great job.&quot;

==Other media and endeavors==
Heyman is the co-founder of the award-winning New York City firm The Looking4Larry Agency. The firm broke new ground with its initial campaign with Electronic Arts, THQ video games, 2K Sports, the Hard Rock Hotel, and Casino Las Vegas. Heyman also worked with Brock Lesnar, collaborating with him on Lesnar&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Death Clutch: My Story of Determination, Domination, and Survival&quot;. He has appeared in the video games &quot;WWE Day of Reckoning&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K18&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K19&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K20, WWE 2K22, WWE 2K23,&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;.

Heyman portrayed a sports announcer in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Rollerball&quot;, and an uncredited role in the WWE film &quot;Countdown&quot;. After a family emergency forced the original actor to pull out, he was chosen by &quot;I Am Legend&quot; executive producer Michael Tadross to play &quot;Gino&quot; in the film adaptation of the long-running Off-Broadway show &quot;Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.

==Personal life==
Heyman is a father of two children.

Heyman rarely sleeps more than three to four hours per night. He is a film enthusiast who cites &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938) and &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994) as his favorite films, and a great admirer of punk musician Henry Rollins, whom he described as &quot;one of the most underrated social commentators out there&quot;.

Former ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer has spoken about how he planned to assassinate Heyman at WrestleMania X-Seven due to Heyman&#x27;s financial mistreatment of both Dreamer and other ECW wrestlers.

<text>The Parliament House ( ) is the seat of the parliament of Sweden, the Riksdag. It is located on nearly half of Helgeandsholmen (island), in the (old town) district of central Stockholm.

==Architecture==
The building complex was designed by Aron Johansson in the Neoclassical style, with a centered Baroque Revival style facade section. Parliament House was constructed between 1897 and 1905.

In 1889, a competition had been held to select a design for the new Parliament building, that Johansson won. Upon opening, it replaced the Old Riksdag Building (&quot;Gamla Riksdagshuset&quot;) on Riddarholmen (island).

The two buildings of the complex were originally constructed to house the Riksdag in one, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) in the second, of a semicircular shape.

;Assembly Hall expansion
After the bicameral Riksdag was replaced by a unicameral legislature in 1971, and the bank relocated, the building housing the bank was rebuilt to house the new Assembly Hall. During the construction, the Parliament moved into temporary premises in the newly erected Kulturhuset (House of Culture) south of Sergels Torg, also in central Stockholm.

The Right Livelihood Award has been presented to recipients at a ceremony in Parliament House. The award was established in 1980 to honour and support those &quot;offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.&quot; There presently 149 Laureates from 62 countries.

<text>Alice Duer Miller (July 28, 1874 – August 22, 1942) was an American writer whose poetry actively influenced political opinion. Her feminist verses influenced political opinion during the American suffrage movement, and her verse novel &quot;The White Cliffs&quot; influenced political thought during the U.S.&#x27;s entry into World War II. She also wrote novels and screenplays.

==Early life==
Alice Duer Miller was born in Staten Island, New York, on July 28, 1874, into a wealthy and prominent family. She grew up in Weehawken, New Jersey with her parents and two sisters. She was the daughter of James Gore King Duer and Elizabeth Wilson Meads. The family lost their fortune during the Baring Bank failure.

Her mother Elizabeth Wilson Meads was the daughter of Orlando Meads of Albany, New York. Her great-grandfather was William Alexander Duer, president of Columbia College. Her great-great-grandfather was William Duer, an American lawyer, developer, and speculator from New York City. He had served in the Continental Congress and the convention that framed the New York Constitution. In 1778, he signed the United States Articles of Confederation. Her great-great-great-grandfather was William Alexander, who claimed the disputed title of Earl of Stirling and was an American major-general during the American Revolutionary War.

Miller was also a descendant of Senator Rufus King, who was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat. He was a delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress. He also attended the Constitutional Convention and was one of the signatories of the United States Constitution on September 17, 1787.
Alice attended Barnard College in 1895, studying Mathematics and Astronomy and graduating Phi Beta Kappa. She helped to pay for her studies by selling novels and short essays to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; magazines. Alice excelled as a student with her award-winning thesis &quot;Dedekind&#x27;s Theory of the Irrational Number&quot;. She and her sister Caroline jointly published a book of poems. Miller remained connected to Barnard throughout her life; she was elected as a trustee of Barnard College in 1922.
==Career==
Alice wrote her entire life, but before she was a full-time writer, she taught at a girls school English composition and tutored Barnard College students in mathematics. Miller became known as a campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage and was an active member of the Algonquin Round Table and Heterodoxy. She published a series of satirical poems in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; titled and later republished in the collection, &quot;Are Women People?&quot; These words became a catchphrase of the suffrage movement. Part of one poem reads:

&quot;FATHER, what is a Legislature?&lt;br&gt;
A representative body elected by the people of the state.&lt;br&gt;
Are women people?&lt;br&gt;
No, my son, criminals, lunatics and women are not people.&lt;br&gt;
Do legislators legislate for nothing?&lt;br&gt;
Oh, no; they are paid a salary.&lt;br&gt;
By whom?&lt;br&gt;
By the people.&lt;br&gt;
Are women people?&lt;br&gt;
Of course, my son, just as much as men are.&quot; She followed this collection with &quot;Women Are People!&quot; (1917).

As a novelist, she scored her first success with &quot;Come Out of the Kitchen&quot; in 1916. The story was made into a play and later the 1948 film &quot;Spring in Park Lane.&quot; She followed it with a series of other short novels, many of which were staged and (increasingly) made into films.

Her novel in verse &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; (1933) was about a tragic love affair; many consider it her greatest work. Miller was invited to write for Hollywood in 1921 by Samuel Goldwyn. Many of her stories became motion pictures, such as &quot;Are Parents People?&quot; (1925), &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935), and &quot;Irene&quot; (1940). She also became involved in a number of motion picture screenplays, including &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot; (1936). Her name appears in the very first issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as an advisory editor. Throughout her life, she wrote successfully for a wide range of genres and produced forty-four books.
==&quot;The White Cliffs&quot;==
In 1940, she wrote the verse novel &quot;The White Cliffs&quot;, about an American girl who coming to London as a tourist, meets and marries a young upper-class Englishman in the period just before World War I. The war begins and he goes to the front. He is killed just before the end of the War, leaving her with a young son. Her son is the heir to the family estate. Despite the pull of her own country and the impoverished condition of the estate, she decides to stay and live the traditional life of a member of the English upper class. The story concludes as World War II commences, and she worries that her son, like his father, will be killed fighting for the country he loves. The poem ends with the lines:

:...I am American bred
:I have seen much to hate here – much to forgive,
:But in a world in which England is finished and dead,
:I do not wish to live.

The poem was spectacularly successful on both sides of the Atlantic, selling nearly one million copies – an unheard of number for a book of verse. It was broadcast and recorded by British-American actress Lynn Fontanne (with a symphonic accompaniment), and the story was made into the 1944 film &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot;.

==Personal life==
Once she graduated, she married Henry Wise Miller on October 5, 1899, at Grace Church Chapel in New York City. Henry asked Alice to marry him three days after their first meeting. He was a Harvard graduate, born in 1877, the son of Lt. Commander Jacob Miller. 
They moved to Costa Rica, where Henry Miller was gambling on land speculation and rubber cultivation. Henry and Alice had their first son Denning Duer Miller in this time period when they were moving back and forth between New York City and Costa Rica. Their investment failed and the family moved back to New York City and struggled for years financially. Alice served as the primary breadwinner for the first decade of the marriage until Henry became a Wall Street stockbroker, funded by his wife&#x27;s money. The Millers lived somewhat separate lives, deliberately spending part of each year away from each other, and Powers comments that it is possible it was an open marriage. Henry Miller had a long affair with Daisy Bacon. It is not known if Alice Miller was aware of her husband&#x27;s infidelity, but she may have been. Powers suggests that her long poem &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; (1931) is a veiled reference to her own marriage: the protagonist has an affair with a younger woman, but refuses to leave his wife for her.

After a long illness, Alice Duer Miller died in 1942 and was interred at Evergreen Cemetery in Morristown, New Jersey.

<text>The Case Against Free Trade: GATT, NAFTA, and the Globalization of Corporate Power () is a book edited by Ralph Nader which was first published in 1993. Besides Nader himself, the chapters are authored by many well known writers, activists and politicians.

The volume is critical of the free trade system, claiming that corporations are using free trade as a cloak or smokescreen under which they intend to circumvent the democratic process to harm the health and safety of the general public. According to an excerpt from the introduction, &quot;operating under the deceptive banner of &quot;free&quot; trade, multinational corporations are working hard to expand their control over the international economy and to undo vital health, safety, and economic protections won by citizen movements across the globe in recent decades.&quot;

<doc id="551768" wikidata="Q901315" url="?curid=551768" title="Toulouse chemical factory explosion">
<text>On 21 September 2001, an explosion occurred at the AZF (French initialism for &quot;AZote Fertilisant&quot;, i.e. nitrogen fertiliser) fertiliser factory in Toulouse, France, belonging to the &quot;Grande Paroisse&quot; branch of the Total group.

Three hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate was stored (the maximum capacity was 2,000 tonnes) in hangar 221 222. The entire factory was destroyed, making a crater with a depth of about and a diameter of . Steel girders were found away from the explosion site. The blast measured 3.4 on the Richter scale, with an estimated power equivalent to 20-40 tons of TNT. The explosion was heard 80 km (50 miles) away. Due to the acoustics of the hills and the loud sound, the explosion was reported as occurring in multiple places. Police at first believed that at least five bombs had simultaneously gone off. There is still controversy over the exact number of explosions.

The factory was close to the city: one of the most inhabited areas, &quot;Le Mirail&quot;, is away. Around ten percent of the inhabitants of Toulouse had to be evacuated.

==Victims==
The disaster caused 31 deaths, about 30 seriously wounded, and 2,500 light casualties. Two thirds of the city&#x27;s windows were shattered, causing 70 eye wounds. The total damages paid by insurance groups exceeded 1.5 billion euros.

==Investigation==

On 4 October 2001, France&#x27;s then Environment Minister Yves Cochet announced that the explosion &quot;may have been a terrorist attack&quot; (the explosion occurred ten days after the September 11 attacks) and identified Hassan Jandoubi, a plant sub-contractor killed in the blast, as a person under investigation. French anti-terrorist authorities were prohibited by the Toulouse prosecutor from searching Jandoubi&#x27;s house for five days after the incident.

Police declared that Jandoubi had &quot;possible Islamic fundamentalist sympathies&quot;, yet by the time the search was finally conducted, they said that Jandoubi&#x27;s girlfriend had disposed of all traces of his clothes and photos. Authorities described the delay as damaging to the investigation.

In May 2006, the official investigation released a final report supporting a chemical accident theory in which sodium dichlorocyanurate mixed with 500 kg of ammonium nitrate spilled on the main nitrate pile 20 minutes before the explosion.

<text>Opisthobranchs () is a now informal name for a large and diverse group of specialized complex gastropods which used to be united in the subclass Opisthobranchia. That taxon is no longer considered to represent a monophyletic grouping.

Euopisthobranchia is a taxon containing a revised collection of opisthobranchs, and that taxon is considered monophyletic. Euopisthobranchia does not include some &quot;traditional&quot; opisthobranchs such as the Sacoglossa and the Acochlidiacea. The subclass Heterobranchia now contains all the species which used to be assigned to Opisthobranchia, plus all the species in the Pulmonata.

The subclass Opisthobranchia included species in the order Cephalaspidea (bubble shells and headshield slugs), the sacoglossans, anaspidean sea hares, pelagic sea angels, sea butterflies, and many families of the Nudibranchia.

&quot;Opisthobranch&quot; means &quot;gills behind&quot; (and to the right) of the heart. In contrast, &quot;Prosobranch&quot; means &quot;gills in front&quot; (of the heart). Opisthobranchs are characterized by two pairs of tentacles and a single gill behind and to the right of the heart. With the lack of a heavily mineralized shell, there has been very little fossil record of the group. However, molecular clock studies have suggested that Opisthobranchia emerged as early as the Carboniferous.

== Taxonomy ==
Under the 1931 classification system drawn up by Johannes Thiele, the class Gastropoda was divided into three subclasses; Prosobranchia, Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia. The latter two were later combined into a single order.

The current classification of the gastropods is more nuanced, with the following subclasses:
* Subclass Caenogastropoda
* Subclass Cocculiniformia
* Subclass Heterobranchia
* Subclass Neomphalina
* Subclass Neritimorpha
* Subclass Patellogastropoda
* Subclass Vetigastropoda
* Subclass Gastropoda incertae sedis

===As a non-monophyletic taxon===
It was speculated as far back as 1985 that the Opisthobranchia were paraphyletic, based on morphological evidence, and had given rise to the Pulmonata, a group also of subclass rank.

Because the Pulmonata are a sibling group to an opisthobranch taxon, some authors argued that the Opisthobranchia are therefore not a monophyletic group and can no longer be accepted as a valid taxon. The opisthobranchs are now included within the subclass Heterobranchia, although many manuals and websites still use the old classification.

A phylogenetic study published in November 2004, gave new definitions of the seven main lineages of the Opisthobranchia.

However, in 2005, a study of rRNA gene sequences could not resolve monophyly versus paraphyly of the Opisthobranchia 
Subsequent taxonomic classification in 2005 overturned the Opisthobranchia as a valid clade, reclassifying it as an informal group within the Heterobranchia. Accordingly, articles no longer use the term Opisthobranchia, replacing it with Heterobranchia to emphasise a different concept. 

By 2011, the &quot;Opisthobranchia&quot; were declared artificial and obsolete and were replaced by new phylogenetic hypotheses. The concept was abandoned. It now includes including &quot;Lower Heterobranchia&quot;, Acteonimorpha, Ringipleura, Umbraculida, Cephalaspidea, Runcinida, Aplysiida, Pteropoda and Sacoglossa. 

===Linnean taxonomy===
Order Opisthobranchia – sea slugs
*Suborder Cephalaspidea – headshield slugs and bubble shells
*Suborder Sacoglossa – sap-sucking slugs and bivalved gastropods
*Suborder Aplysiomorpha – sea hares
*Suborder Notaspidea – sidegill slugs
*Suborder Thecosomata sea butterflies with shells
*Suborder Gymnosomata – sea angels, no shells
*Suborder Nudibranchia – nudibranchs
**Infraorder Anthobranchia 
**Infraorder Cladobranchia 

==Description==
The reduction or loss of the shell, the elaboration of the head, foot or mantle, and the acquisition of chemical defences are evolutionary trends shared by most opisthobranch taxa.

The loss of shell in the group is an example of parallel evolution and has occurred on multiple independent occasions.

Opisthobranchs have undergone detorsion, an evolutionary reversal of the half revolution torsion of their immediate ancestors. As a result of this detorsion, the visceral ganglia no longer overlap and are described as euthyneurous (as opposed to streptoneurous, the more common condition among gastropods, in which these ganglia form a distinct twist within the animal&#x27;s body).

There is no marked distinction between head and mantle. The tentacles, situated close to the mouth, are used for orientation. Behind them are the rhinophores, olfactory organs which often have complex forms. The middle part of the foot is the sole, used for locomotion. The sides of the foot have evolved into parapodia, fleshy winglike outgrowths. In several suborders, such as the Thecosomata and Gymnosomata, these parapodia are used to move in a swimming motion.

Their eyes are simple pit-cup eyes with a lens and cornea capable of detecting light and the passage of shadows but not of producing a coherent image.

== Ecology ==
Opisthobranchia represents a morphologically diverse group of gastropods occupying a great variety of ecological niches. Opisthobranchs have a global distribution, but are restricted almost exclusively to marine habitats with the only exception being few freshwater acochlidians.

==Defense==
Principally soft-bodied marine creatures with a reduced or absent shell and no operculum, opisthobranchs use other methods for protection. The group has a diverse variety of highly specialized auxiliary defenses. Due to a combination of outstanding camouflage and aggressive toxicity they have few predators. However, some use warning colouration. Animals that do predate opisthobranchs include other opisthobranchs and toxin-resistant predators like sea spiders.

Opisthobranchs secrete irritants such as strong acids or accumulate toxins from their food. Aeolidioidea pirate the stinging cells from their cnidarian prey and use them for their own defense.

==Diet==

Opisthobranchs may be herbivores, detritivores or carnivores. Being slow, the carnivores hunt sedentary prey. They may eat bryozoans, Cnidaria, or sponges, absorbing the sponge toxin for defensive purposes. Opisthobranchs may maintain the zooxanthellae of their coral prey and use their metabolic products for themselves. Some herbivorous slugs of the sub-order Sacoglossa do the same with the chloroplasts of the algae they eat.

==Communication==

Like most lifeforms, they use chemical cues for much of their life cycle. The planktonic larvae float until a pheromone alerts them to a suitable settling site, sometimes delaying metamorphosis until favourable chemicals, such as prey pheromones, are detected. Some mating opisthobranchs release chemicals to attract conspecifics.

==Reproduction==

Opisthobranchs are hermaphrodites and have complex reproductive strategies, typically involving reciprocal sperm transfer and storage until the eggs are ready for fertilisation. Eggs are commonly laid in ribbons of varying structure. The egg ribbons are usually unique to each species and in some cases are the only means of differentiating them.

<doc id="551777" wikidata="Q252632" url="?curid=551777" title="Air ioniser">
<text>An air ioniser (or negative ion generator or Chizhevsky&#x27;s chandelier) is a device that uses high voltage to ionise (electrically charge) air molecules. Negative ions, or anions, are particles with one or more extra electrons, conferring a net negative charge to the particle. Cations are positive ions missing one or more electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. Some commercial air purifiers are designed to generate negative ions. Another type of air ioniser is the electrostatic discharge (ESD) ioniser (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise static charge.

==History==
In 1918 Alexander Chizhevsky created the first air ioniser for ion therapy. It was originally used for animal health in agriculture.
This discovery ignited Cecil Alfred &quot;Coppy&quot; Laws&#x27; interest in the phenomenon of air ionisation. Laws has been credited with being the inventor of the domestic air ioniser.

==Ionic air purifiers==

Air ionisers are used in air purifiers to remove particles from air. Airborne particles become charged as they attract charged ions from the ioniser by electrostatic attraction. The particles in turn are then attracted to any nearby earthed (grounded) conductors, either deliberate plates within an air cleaner, or simply the nearest walls and ceilings. The frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service (NHS) to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne &quot;acinetobacter&quot; infections in a ward were eliminated after the installation of a negative air ioniser — a promising result, although more evidence is necessary to determine if these results can be repeated. Positive and negative ions produced by air conditioning systems have also been found by a manufacturer to inactivate viruses including influenza.

A 2018 review found that negative air ions are highly effective in removing particulate matter from air.

The SARS epidemic fuelled the desire for personal ionisers in East Asia, including Japan (where many products have been specialised to contain negative ion generators, including toothbrushes, refrigerators, air conditioners, air cleaners, and washing machines). There are no specific standards for these devices.

There are two types of ionic air purifiers, the fanless and fan base ionizers. The fan base ionizer uses its fan to circulate air around the room rapidly, but it is noisier and consumes more energy, while the fanless types distribute air slowly, taking a longer time to purify air, but are noiseless and more energy efficient.

==Ions versus ozone==
Ionisers are distinct from ozone generators, although both devices operate in a similar way. Ionisers use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged air ions (for instance N2+ or O2− ; these &quot;primary&quot; ions then immediately cluster with other air molecules such as H2O) that particulate matter sticks to. Ionisers tend to produce negative ions since these are supposed to have beneficial health effects. Even the best ionisers will also produce a small amount of ozone—triatomic oxygen, O3—which is unwanted. Ozone generators are optimised to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O2 molecule, using either a corona discharge tube or UV light.

At concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone has been found to have little potential to remove indoor air contaminants. At high concentrations ozone can be toxic to air-borne bacteria, and may destroy or kill these sometimes infectious organisms. However, the required concentrations are sufficiently toxic to humans and animals that the U.S. FDA declares that ozone has no place in medical treatment and has taken action against businesses that offer ozone generators or ozone therapy to consumers. Ozone is a highly toxic and extremely reactive gas. A higher daily average than 0.1 ppm (100 ppb, 0.2 mg/m3) is not recommended and can damage the lungs and olfactory bulb cells directly.

==Health effects==
A 2013 comprehensive review of 80 years of research into air ions and respiratory function outcomes found that there was no clear support for any beneficial role in respiratory function, nor evidence for significant detrimental effect. In conclusion, &quot;exposure to negative or positive air ions does not appear to play an appreciable role in respiratory function.&quot;

There is weak evidence that negative air ionization is associated with lower depression scores, particularly at the highest exposure level. No consistent influence of positive or negative air ionization on anxiety, mood, relaxation, sleep, and personal comfort measures was observed.

===Adverse health effects of ozone byproduct===
Studies have been carried out on negative ion generators. One study shows that the ozone generated can exceed guidelines in small, non ventilated areas. Another study showed that ozone can react with other constituents, namely cleaning agents to increase pollutants such as formaldehyde; this study&#x27;s objective was testing for health risks associated with indoor use of cleaning products and air fresheners as opposed to adverse health effects of air ionisers.

==&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; court case==
&quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, a non-profit U.S.-based product-testing magazine, reported in October 2003 that air ionisers do not perform to high enough standards compared to conventional HEPA filters. The exception was a combination unit that used a fan to move air while ionizing it. In response to this report, The Sharper Image, a manufacturer of air ionisers (among other products), sued Consumer&#x27;s Union (the publishers of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;) for product defamation. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; gave the Ionic Breeze and other popular units a &quot;fail&quot; because they have a low clean air delivery rate (CADR). CADR measures the amount of filtered air circulated during a short period of time, and was originally designed to rate media-based air cleaners. The Sharper Image claimed that this test was a poor way to rate the Ionic Breeze, since it does not take into account other features, such as 24-hour-a-day continuous cleaning, ease of maintenance, and silent operation.

The United States District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the case, reasoning that the Sharper Image had failed to demonstrate that it could prove any of the statements made by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; were false. The court&#x27;s final ruling in May 2005 ordered the Sharper Image to pay US$525,000 for Consumer Union&#x27;s legal expenses.

==Electrostatic neutraliser in electronics==
Air ionisers are often used in places where work is done involving static-electricity-sensitive electronic components (like in microelectronics cleanrooms), to eliminate the build-up of static charges on non-conductors. As those elements are very sensitive to electricity, they cannot be grounded because the discharge will destroy them as well. Usually, the work is done over a special dissipative table mat, which allows a very slow discharge, and under the air gush of an ioniser. The ionization falls off very sharply with distance (even in ducting), so air ionization is rarely used for this purpose, and only for items immediately adjacent to the actual ionizer.

== Standards ==
The California Air Resources Board has a page listing air cleaners (many with ionizers) meeting their indoor ozone limit of 0.050 parts per million.

<doc id="551781" wikidata="Q640816" url="?curid=551781" title="Bernard Manning">
<text>Bernard John Manning (13 August 1930 – 18 June 2007) was an English comedian and nightclub owner. He gained a high profile on British television during the 1970s, appearing on shows such as &quot;The Comedians&quot; and &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot;. His act became controversial as attitudes changed, with the result that Manning was rarely seen on television in the last few decades of his career. However, he continued to perform at live venues until his death.

==Early life==
Manning was born in Harpurhey, Lancashire, and raised in Ancoats, both poor districts of Manchester, the second of three brothers and two sisters. He had Russian Jewish ancestry on his father&#x27;s side, as well as roots in Ireland, and was brought up a &quot;strict Catholic&quot;. He claimed, in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Allison Pearson, that his paternal grandfather came from Sebastopol, and changed the family name from Blomberg.

He left school aged 14, worked in a tobacco factory and joined his father&#x27;s greengrocery business, before joining the British Army to do his National Service.

Manning had little thought of entertainment as a career, until posted to Germany where, in his self-written obituary (in which he claimed to have guarded Nazi war criminals Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer in Spandau Prison, Berlin, just after the Second World War), he began to sing popular songs to entertain his fellow soldiers and pass the time. This ability led him to put on free shows at the weekends; when he began to charge admission and audiences did not decrease, he realised that there was a possibility of making money from show business.

==Career==
On returning to England, Manning continued to sing professionally, and also worked as a compère. He was an effective singer of popular ballads and fronted big bands in the 1950s, such as the Oscar Rabin Band, which included appearances at the Ritz Hotel. Over the years he began to introduce humour into his compering. This went down well, and Manning slowly moved from being a singer and compère to a comedian. In 1959, Manning borrowed £30,000 from his father and bought a dilapidated billiard hall on the A664 Rochdale Road, and turned it into the Embassy Club. Rather quickly Manning&#x27;s income substantially increased. The club played host to many other acts, and Manning claimed that the Beatles performed there early in their career.

After much work in comedy clubs and northern working men&#x27;s clubs in the 1950s and 1960s, he made his television debut in 1971 on the Granada comedy show &quot;The Comedians&quot;. He compèred &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot;, which began in 1974. In this period, Manning&#x27;s material was often accepted as being &quot;harmless banter&quot;.

He hosted the 1980 documentary short &quot;The Great British Striptease&quot;, filmed in Blackpool, and had a starring role in a comedy quiz show &quot;Under Manning&quot;, produced by Southern Television in 1981. The series was poorly received and short-lived, and by the 1980s Manning had fallen out of favour with television companies, either because of changing tastes or his failure to compromise with television companies. However his appearances on the northern Working Men&#x27;s Club circuit continued, playing to packed audiences which he claimed sometimes included people from ethnic minorities. 

In 1994, two black waitresses at a charity dinner at a hotel in Derbyshire took exception to Manning&#x27;s act and appealed to an industrial tribunal against the management of the hotel for racial discrimination, claiming that the word &quot;wog&quot; had been used. Manning said in response that &quot;wog&quot; was &quot;a horrible, insulting word I&#x27;ve never used in my life&quot; but defended use of the words &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;coon&quot; as historical terms with legitimate roots. The complainants initially lost, but the decision was overturned on appeal and they were awarded an undisclosed sum. On an appearance on &quot;The Mrs. Merton Show&quot; on 19 March 1998, Manning admitted that he was a racist, which surprised host Caroline Aherne and went down badly with the audience.

Manning never toned down his act, but he had a minor television career revival towards the end of his life, including Channel 4 taking him to Mumbai to perform. In October 2002, he participated in a &quot;Great Lives&quot; programme for Radio 4. He chose to honour the Roman Catholic nun Mother Teresa. In 2003, Manning was initially reported to have been booked to play a BNP rally. He denied this, telling the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a lot of bollocks. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m working. Speak to my agent. I don&#x27;t know about any BNP nonsense. I would not do it anyway. Do you think I&#x27;m fucking barmy?&quot; In 2006, he appeared at the 45th birthday party of chef Marco Pierre White.

From 1999 his son, Bernard Manning Jr, managed the Embassy Club, shortly after his father had a mini stroke and became deaf in one ear. He considered his father&#x27;s act inappropriate for bookings and sought to turn the club into an alternative comedy venue.

==Comedic style==
Race, sex, and religion were the core material for many of Manning&#x27;s jokes. Manning&#x27;s family and friends said that his controversial ways were all an act. He lived next door to an Indian physician&#x27;s family, who have appeared in many newspaper articles over the years to defend Manning. Satya Rudravajhala, the widow of Visveswara Rao Rudravajhala, wrote a eulogy that was published in the local paper, the &quot;Middleton Guardian&quot;, conveying the family&#x27;s sentiments.

In interviews with journalists, Manning would remind them of his appearance with Dean Martin in Las Vegas and meeting the Queen. He said he was a great believer in family values who never swore in front of his mother, stating: &quot;I dragged myself up by my bootlaces. I don&#x27;t drink or smoke, I don&#x27;t take drugs. I have never been a womaniser. I was brought up right with good parents and I have never been in trouble or harmed no-one. And I love my family.&quot;

By the early 1980s Manning&#x27;s style of comedy was being seen as increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect. Later detractors criticised his style of humour, with television presenter Esther Rantzen commenting in 1992 that, &quot;for me, he&#x27;s always been the villain of comedy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Manning named his house in Alkrington &quot;Shalom&quot;, the Hebrew word for &quot;peace&quot;. 

Manning was a lifelong Manchester City supporter. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 27 November 1991. For many of his later years, he was a teetotaller and a diabetic.

Having been admitted two weeks earlier for a kidney complaint, Manning died in North Manchester General Hospital at 3:10 pm on 18 June 2007. He was 76. He had written his own eulogy, which appeared as an obituary in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; two days later.

==Legacy==
In March 2007, he was ranked 29th on the list of the 100 Greatest Stand Up comedians in a poll conducted by Channel 4. The writer and performer Barry Cryer said when Manning died: &quot;The thing about Bernard was that he looked funny, he sounded funny and he had excellent timing. It was just what he actually said that could be worrying.&quot;

In 2010, BBC Four commissioned Alice Nutter to write a biographical drama based on Manning&#x27;s life. The screenplay was completed but cuts to the channel&#x27;s budget led to the piece never being filmed.

<doc id="551783" wikidata="Q7314586" url="?curid=551783" title="House Republican Conference">
<text>The House Republican Conference is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives. It hosts meetings, and is the primary forum for communicating the party&#x27;s message to members. The conference produces a daily publication of political analysis under the title &quot;Legislative Digest&quot;.

When the conference holds the majority of seats, it is usually led by the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who is assisted on the floor by the House majority leader and the party&#x27;s chief whip. When in the minority, it is led by the House minority leader, assisted by the chief whip. The conference has a chair who directs day-to-day operations and who is assisted by an elected vice chair and a secretary.

In the 118th Congress, the conference is led by Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, assisted by Majority Leader Steve Scalise (also of Louisiana), and Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The current chair is Lisa McClain of Michigan, who assumed the position .

<text>Mary Robinson (née Darby; 27 November 1757 – 26 December 1800) was an English actress, poet, dramatist, novelist, and celebrity figure. She lived in England, in the cities of Bristol and London; she also lived in France and Germany for a time. She enjoyed poetry from the age of seven and started working, first as a teacher and then as actress, from the age of 14. She wrote many plays, poems and novels. She was a celebrity, gossiped about in newspapers, famous for her acting and writing. During her lifetime she was known as &quot;the English Sappho&quot;. She earned her nickname &quot;Perdita&quot; for her role as Perdita (heroine of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;) in 1779, and was the first public mistress of King George IV while he was still Prince of Wales.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Robinson was born in Bristol, England to Nicholas Darby, a naval captain, and his wife Hester (née Vanacott) who had married at Donyatt, Somerset, in 1749, and was baptised &#x27;Polle(y)&#x27; (&quot;Spelt &#x27;Polle&#x27; in the official register and &#x27;Polly&#x27; in the Bishop&#x27;s Transcript&quot;) at St Augustine&#x27;s Church, Bristol, 19 July 1758, the entry noting that she was born on 27 November 1756. In her memoirs, Robinson gives her birth in 1758, but the year 1757 seems more likely according to recently published research (see appendix to Byrne, 2005). Robinson attended a school in Bristol run by the social reformer Hannah More. More brought her students, including Robinson, to see &quot;King Lear&quot;. Her father deserted her mother and took a mistress when Robinson was still a child. The family hoped for a reconciliation, but Captain Darby made it clear that this was not going to happen. Without the support of her husband, Hester Darby supported herself and the five children born of the marriage by starting a school for young girls in Little Chelsea, London (where Robinson taught by her 14th birthday). However, during one of his brief returns to the family, Captain Darby had the school closed (which he was entitled to do by English law). Captain Darby died in the Russian naval service in 1785. When Robinson was 15 years old, Samuel Cox, a solicitor, told the famed actor David Garrick about Robinson and brought her to Garrick&#x27;s home in the Adelphi. Garrick was profoundly impressed with Robinson. He was especially enchanted by her voice, remarking that it bore a resemblance to the much-admired Susannah Cibber. Garrick had just retired but decided to tutor Robinson in acting. Robinson noted, &quot;My tutor [David Garrick] was the most sanguine in his expectations of my success, and every rehearsal seemed to strengthen his flattering opinion... He would sometimes dance a minuet with me, sometimes request me to sing the favourite ballads of the day.&quot;

===Marriage===
When Robinson was about 14 years old, Hester Darby encouraged her to accept the proposal of an articled clerk, Thomas Robinson, who claimed to have an inheritance. Mary was against this idea; however, after falling ill and watching him take care of her and her younger brother, she felt that she owed him, and she did not want to disappoint her mother who was pushing for the engagement. After the early marriage, Robinson discovered her husband did not have an inheritance. He continued to live an elaborate lifestyle, however, and made no effort to hide multiple affairs. Subsequently, Mary supported their family. After her husband squandered their money, the couple fled to Talgarth, Breconshire (where Robinson&#x27;s only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born in November 1784). Here they lived in a fairly large estate, called Tregunter Park. Eventually her husband was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison where she lived with him for many months. While it was common for the wives of prisoners to live with their husbands while indebted, children were usually sent to live with relatives to keep them away from the dangers of prison. However, Robinson was deeply devoted to her daughter Maria, and when her husband was imprisoned, Robinson brought the six-month-old baby with her.

It was in the Fleet Prison that Robinson&#x27;s literary career really began, as she found that she could publish poetry to earn money, and to give her an escape from the harsh reality that had become her life. Her first book, &quot;Poems By Mrs. Robinson&quot;, was published in 1775 by C. Parker. Additionally, Robinson&#x27;s husband was offered work in the form of copying legal documents so he could try to pay back some of his debts, but he refused to do anything. Robinson, in an effort to keep the family together and to get back to normal life outside of prison, took the job instead, collecting the pay that her husband neglected to earn. During this time, Mary Robinson found a patron in Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, who sponsored the publication of Robinson&#x27;s second volume of poems, &quot;Captivity.&quot;

===Theatre===
After her husband obtained his release from prison, Robinson decided to return to the theatre. She launched her acting career and took to the stage playing Juliet at Drury Lane Theatre in December 1776. The renowned playwright, author, and Member of Parliament, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, demonstrated significant support for Robinson. He was a constant presence by her side, offering encouragement as she embarked on the stage in this role. Robinson was best known for her facility with the &#x27;breeches parts&#x27;, and her performances as Viola in William Shakespeare&#x27;s&quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; won her extensive praise. But she gained popularity with playing in &quot;Florizel and Perdita&quot;, an adaptation of Shakespeare, with the role of Perdita (heroine of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;) in 1779. It was during this performance that she attracted the notice of the young Prince of Wales, later King George IV of the United Kingdom. He offered her 20,000 pounds to become his mistress. During this time, the very young Emma, Lady Hamilton sometimes worked as her maid and dresser at the theatre.

With her new social prominence, Robinson became a trend-setter in London, introducing a loose, flowing muslin style of gown based upon Grecian statuary that became known as the Perdita. It took Robinson a considerable amount of time to decide to leave her husband for the Prince, as she did not want to be seen by the public as that type of woman. Throughout much of her life she struggled to live in the public eye and also to stay true to the values in which she believed. She eventually gave in to her desires to be with a man who she thought would treat her better than Mr Robinson. However, the Prince ended the affair in 1781, refusing to pay the promised sum. &quot;Perdita&quot; Robinson was left to support herself through an annuity promised by the Crown (but rarely paid), in return for some letters written by the Prince, and through her writings. After her affair with the young Prince of Wales she became famous for her rides in her extravagant carriages and her celebrity–like perception by the public.

=== Later life and death ===

Mary Robinson, who now lived separately from her husband, went on to have several love affairs, most notably with Banastre Tarleton, a soldier who had recently distinguished himself fighting in the American War of Independence. Prior to their relationship, Robinson had been having an affair with a man named Lord Malden. According to one account, Malden and Tarleton were betting men, and Malden was really confident in Robinson&#x27;s loyalty to him, and believed that no man could ever take her from him. As such, he made a bet of a thousand guineas that none of the men in his circle could seduce her. Unfortunately for Malden, Tarleton accepted the bet and swooped in to not only seduce Robinson, but establish a relationship that would last the next 15 years. This relationship, though rumoured to have started on a bet, saw Tarleton&#x27;s rise in military rank and his concomitant political successes, Mary&#x27;s own various illnesses, financial vicissitudes and the efforts of Tarleton&#x27;s own family to end the relationship. They had no children, although Robinson had a miscarriage. However, in the end, Tarleton married Susan Bertie, an heiress and an illegitimate daughter of the young 4th Duke of Ancaster, and niece of his sisters Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lady Cholmondeley. In 1783, Robinson suffered a mysterious illness that left her partially paralysed. Biographer Paula Byrne speculates that a streptococcal infection resulting from a miscarriage led to a severe rheumatic fever that left her disabled for the rest of her life.

From the late 1780s, Robinson became distinguished for her poetry and was called &quot;the English Sappho&quot;. In addition to poems, she wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death. Like her contemporary Mary Wollstonecraft, she championed the rights of women and was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution. She died in poverty at Englefield Cottage, Englefield Green, Surrey, 26 December 1800, aged 44, having survived several years of ill health, and was survived by her daughter, Maria Elizabeth (1774–1818), who was also a published novelist. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband Thomas Robinson from whom she had long been separated and who in 1803 inherited a substantial estate from his half-brother William. One of Robinson&#x27;s dying wishes was to see the rest of her works published. She tasked her daughter, Maria Robinson, with publishing most of these works. She also placed her &quot;Memoirs&quot; in the care of her daughter, insisting that she publish the work. Maria Robinson published &quot;Memoirs&quot; just a few months later.

=== Portraits ===

During her lifetime, Robinson also enjoyed the distinction of having her image captured by the most notable artists of the period. The earliest known, drawn by James Roberts II, depicts &quot;Mrs. Robinson in the Character of Amanda&quot; from Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; in 1777. In 1781, Thomas Gainsborough produced an oil sketch, &quot;Mrs. Mary Robinson &#x27;Perdita&#x27;,&quot; and an untitled study. That year, George Romney also painted &quot;Mrs. Mary Robinson&quot; and John Keyse Sherwin printed an untitled portrait. Joshua Reynolds sketched a study for what became &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; in 1782, and in 1784, he finished &quot;Mrs Robinson as Contemplation&quot; for which he also sketched a study. George Dance the Younger sketched a later portrait in 1793.

== Literature ==
In 1792, Robinson published her most popular novel which was a Gothic novel titled, &quot;Vancenza; or The Dangers of Credulity.&quot; The books were &quot;sold out by lunch time on the first day and five more editions quickly followed, making it one of the top-selling novels in the latter part of the eighteenth century.&quot; It did not receive either critical or popular acclaim. In 1794, she wrote &quot;The Widow; or, A Picture of Modern Times&quot;, which portrayed themes of manners in the fashionable world. Since Robinson was a fashion icon and very much involved in the fashion world the novel did not get a lot of favourable reception in 1794 as it might have now. In 1796, she wrote &quot;Angelina: A Novel&quot;. It cost more money than it brought in. Through this novel, she offers her thoughts on the afterlife of her literary career.

There has been an increase in scholarly attention to Robinson’s literary output in recent years. While most of the early literature written about Robinson focused on her sexuality, emphasising her affairs and fashions, she also spoke out about woman&#x27;s place in the literary world, for which she began to receive the attention of feminists and literary scholars in the 1990s. Robinson recognised that, &quot;women writers were deeply ambivalent about the myths of authorship their male counterparts had created&quot; and as a result she sought to elevate woman&#x27;s place in the literary world by recognising women writers in her own work. In &quot;A Letter to the Women of England&quot;, Robinson includes an entire page dedicated to English women writers to support her notion that they were just as capable as men of being successful in the literary world. These ideas have continued to keep Mary Robinson relevant in literary discussions today. In addition to maintaining literary and cultural notability, she has re-attained a degree of celebrity in recent years when several biographies of her appeared, including one by Paula Byrne entitled &quot;Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, and Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson&quot; that became a top-10 best-seller after being selected for the Richard &amp; Judy Book Club.
An eight-volume scholarly edition of Robinson&#x27;s complete works was published in 2009–2010. In 2011, Daniel Robinson (no relation), editor of the poetry for the edition, published the first scholarly monograph to focus exclusively on her literary achievement--&quot;The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame&quot;. A second monograph on Robinson&#x27;s literary career, &quot;Mary Robinson and the Genesis of Romanticism: Literary Dialogues and Debts, 1784–1821&quot;, by Ashley Cross, appeared in 2016. Although, Robinson&#x27;s novels were not as successful as she hoped, she had a talent for her poetry. Her ability to produce poetry can be seen furthermore in her poems titled &quot;Sappho and Phaeon&quot;. Since the press had given her the name &quot;The English Sappho&quot;, a clear relationship can be drawn between these poems and her literary name. The poems are love poems and many scholars have come to the conclusion that they represent her affairs with the Prince of Wales. Mary Darby Robinson was not only praised in literary circles for her poetry but also for her works written in prose. The two best known examples are &quot;A Letter to the Women of England&quot; (1798) and &quot;The Natural Daughter&quot; (1799). Both her works are dealing with the role of women during the Romantic Era. Mary Robinson as much as Mary Wollenstonecraft tried to put the focus on how inferior women were treated in comparison to men. The discrepancy can be seen in both of her works. &quot;The Natural Daughter&quot; can be seen as an autobiography of Mary Robinson. The characters are in many ways patterns of her own life and the stages of her life. All the characters are symbols of her own coming of age or people she met in her life.

=== Poetry ===

From the late 1780s, Robinson, striving to separate herself from her past scandals, and life as a theatre actress, turned to writing as a full-time career. Robinson, disregarding her previous associations with the nickname &quot;Perdita&quot;, meaning &quot;lost one&quot;, soon became distinguished for her poetry and was reclassified as &quot;the English Sappho&quot; by the English public. During her 25-year writing career, from 1775 until her premature death in 1800, Robinson produced an immense body of work. In addition to eight collections of poems, Robinson wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death.

&quot;Poems by Mrs. Robinson&quot; was published by C. Parker, in London, in 1775. &quot;Poems&quot; consisted of &quot;twenty-six ballads, odes, and elegies&quot; that &quot;echo traditional values, praising values such as charity, sincerity, and innocence, particularly in a woman”. Robinson&#x27;s husband, Thomas Robinson was imprisoned at the King&#x27;s Bench Prison for fifteen months for the gambling debts he acquired. Robinson originally intended for the profits made from this collection to help pay off his debts. But the publication of Poems could not prevent his imprisonment. Robinson lived for nine months and three weeks with Thomas and their baby within the squalor of prison.
Motivated by the months she spent in prison, Robinson wrote &quot;Captivity; a Poem and Celadon and Lydia, a Tale&quot;, published by T. Becket in London, in 1777. This collection &quot;described the horrors of captivity and painted a sympathetic picture of the &#x27;wretch&#x27; and the &#x27;guiltless partners of his poignant woes&#x27;...The poem ends admonishing people to open their hearts and to pity the unfortunate...&quot;
Following the publication of Captivity, Robinson established a new poetic identity for herself. Robinson let go of her Della Cruscan style when she wrote Poems by Mary Robinson, published in 1791 by J. Bell in London, and Poems by Mrs. Robinson, published in 1793 by T. Spilsbury in London. A review was written by the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and the reviewer stated that if Robinson had been less blessed with &quot;beauty and captivating manners&quot;,&quot;her poetical taste might have been confined in its influence&quot;. At the end of the review, &quot;the Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine describes her poetry as elegant and harmonious.

In 1795, Robinson wrote a satirical poem titled &quot;London&#x27;s Summer Morning&quot;, but it was published after her death in 1800. This poem showcased Robinson&#x27;s critical perspective of the infrastructure and society of London. Robinson described the busy and loud sounds of the industrialised city in the morning. She employed characters such as the chimney-boy, and ruddy housemaid to make a heavy critique on the way English society treated children as both innocent and fragile creatures.

In 1796, Robinson argued for women&#x27;s rationality, their right to education and illustrated ideas of free will, suicide, rationalisation, empiricism and relationship to sensibility in &quot;Sappho and Phaon: In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets.&quot;

During the 1790s, Robinson was highly inspired by feminism and desired to spread her liberal sentiments through her writing. She was an ardent admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft, an established and influential feminist writer of the period. But to Robinson&#x27;s surprise, her intense feelings were not reciprocated by Wollstonecraft. While Robinson expected a strong friendship between the two of them to flourish, Wollstonecraft &quot;found Robinson herself considerably less appealing than the title character of Angelina&quot;. In 1796, Wollstonecraft wrote an extremely harsh review of Robinson&#x27;s work in the &quot;Analytical Review&quot;. It was this critique that was not critical, or well thought out. Instead, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s review of Robinson proved to be relatively shallow and pointed at her jealousy of Robinson&#x27;s comparable freedom. Wollstonecraft had the potential to spend more of her own time writing, instead of having to entertain her husband, William Goodwin. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Letter to the Women of England against Mental Subordination&quot; is still powerful reading. Robinson reiterates the rights women have to live by sexual passion.
Lastly, in 1800, after years of failing health and decline into financial ruin, Robinson wrote her last piece of literature during her lifetime: a series of poems titled the &quot;Lyrical Tales&quot;, published by Longman &amp; Rees, in London. This poetry collection explored themes of domestic violence, misogyny, violence against destitute characters, and political oppression. &quot;Robinson&#x27;s last work pleads for a recognition of the moral and rational worth of women: &#x27;Let me ask this plain and rational question-- is not woman a human being, gifted with all the feelings that inhabit the bosom of man?&quot; Robinson&#x27;s main objective was to respond to &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; written by authors Wordsworth and Coleridge; who were not as well known at the time. Although it was not as highly praised as Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;, published in 1792, Lyrical Tales provides a &quot;powerful critique of the division of duties and privileges between the sexes. It places Robinson firmly on the side of the &#x27;feminist&#x27; thinkers or &#x27;modern&#x27; philosophers of the 1790s, as one of the strong defenders of her sex&quot;.

== Criticism and reception ==
Robinson was known as a sexualised celebrity, but she was a very talented writer. Robinson did not receive recognition for her work until much later because of &quot;strict attitudes led to a rejection of the literary work of such a notorious woman.&quot; She became a lesson to young girls about the dangers of promiscuity, and pleasure seeking. She was named by her friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge &quot;as a woman of undoubted genius.&quot; The collection of &quot;Poems&quot; published in 1791 had a &quot;subscription list of 600 people was headed by His Royal Highness, George, Prince of Wales, and included many other members of the nobility. Some people subscribed because of her writing, some because of her notoriety, and some perhaps out of pity for the former actress, now crippled and ill. Reviews were generally kind, and noted traces in her poems of a sensibility that would later be termed Romanticism.&quot; Twenty years after her death the &quot;Poetical Works of The Late Mrs. Robinson&quot; was published in 1824, which speaks to her ongoing popularity. Robinson&#x27;s second novel &quot;The Widow&quot;, and in her controversial comedy &quot;Nobody: A Comedy in Two Acts&quot; both of which, according to newspaper reports, offended fashionable women. Needless to say, Robinson&#x27;s playwright career was short-lived after all the bad reviews of her play. The upper class interpreted her satire as mockery on female gambling and it was an attack on moral legitimacy of the Whig elite. The upper class interpretation of &quot;Nobody&quot; reveals a great deal about the social and political anxieties during the revolutionary era.
Robinson&#x27;s poems were popular, especially after she produced a variety of poems whilst working at the newspaper &quot;The Morning Post&quot;. She replaced the poet Robert Southey as chief poetic correspondent and contributor for &quot;The Morning Post&quot; in December 1799, a position she maintained until November 1800, a month before her death. Most of her poetry in newspapers were published utilizing various pseudonyms, such as &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Laura Maria&quot;, &quot;Oberon&quot;, &quot;Sappho&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;Lesbia&quot;, &quot;Portia&quot;, &quot;Bridget&quot;, and &quot;Tabitha Bramble&quot;. The poetry columns had a double agenda of pleasing a substantial and diverse audience and shaping them into a select group of elite readers eager to buy and consume books. The public adored the novel &quot;Vancenza;&quot; or &quot;The Dangers of Credulity,&quot; but the critical reception was mixed. Furthermore, a biographer Paula Byrne recently dismissed it as a &quot;product of the vogue for Gothic fiction [that] now seems overblown to the point of absurdity.&quot; Although Robinson&#x27;s poetry was more popular than her other works, the most lucrative &quot;was her prose. The money helped to support herself, her mother and daughter, and often Banastre Tarleton. Novels such as &quot;Vancenza&quot; (1792), &quot;The Widow&quot; (1794), &quot;Angelina&quot; (1796), and &quot;Walsingham&quot; (1797) went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror, their views could be related to the experiences of their author.&quot;

Mary Robinson was one of the first female celebrities of the modern era. She was dubbed as scandalous, but on the other hand educated and able to be partially independent from her husband. She was one of the first women to enter the sphere of writing, and to be successful there. Scholars often argue that she used her celebrity status only to her own advantage, but it is to be noted how much she contributed to the awareness of early feminism. She tried to elaborate the ideas of equality for women in England during the late 18th century. Nevertheless, many contemporary women were not amused with how she exposed herself to the public and ostracised her. They did not want to be associated with her, since they feared to receive a bad reputation sympathising with Mary Robinson.

<text>Kirsteen Anne &quot;Kirsty&quot; Wark FRSE (born 3 February 1955) is a Scottish television presenter and journalist with a long career at the BBC.

Starting on BBC Radio Scotland, where she became a producer, Wark switched to television, presenting &quot;The Late Show&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot;, as well as hosting her own interview programme and launching a production company. Her activities have included reporting on the Lockerbie bombings, hosting a book quiz and encouraging open discussion of menopause. In &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, she qualified as Star Baker.

Wark&#x27;s powerful, searching interview style and perceived closeness to Labour Party figures have provoked controversy. She was named journalist of the year by BAFTA Scotland in 1993 and Best Television Presenter in 1997.

==Early life==
Wark was born in Dumfries, Scotland, to Jimmy Wark, a solicitor, and Roberta Wark, a schoolteacher. Her father served in the Second Battalion of the Glasgow Highlanders during the Second World War and was awarded a Military Cross for heroism during the Normandy Landings. Wark was educated at Kilmarnock Grammar Primary and subsequently Ayr&#x27;s independent Wellington School. She studied history, specifically Scottish Studies, at the University of Edinburgh.

==Career==

Wark joined the BBC in 1976 as a graduate researcher for BBC Radio Scotland, before promotion a year later as producer of &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; and current affairs programmes.

Wark switched to television in 1982, producing &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot; and the lunchtime political programme &quot;Agenda&quot; and current affairs series &quot;Current Account&quot;. She then moved into presenting, fronting &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;, &quot;Seven Days&quot;, &quot;Left, Right and Centre&quot; and &quot;Scottish Questions&quot; coverage for BBC Scotland, before moving to network television as part of the &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; presenting team. In 1988, she was one of the first reporters to cover the Lockerbie disaster. In 1990, Wark demonstrated her distinctive line of questioning in an interview with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Wark was a presenter on BBC2 arts programme &quot;The Late Show&quot; (from 1990–3) and the heritage programme &quot;One Foot in the Past&quot;. In the mid-1990s, Wark presented the monthly audience debate programme &quot;Words with Wark&quot; (1994–98), In 1999, she presented &quot;The Kirsty Wark Show&quot;, her own interview programme. Wark has been a presenter on the BBC programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; from 1993 to 2024.

During the 1990s, she presented many programmes produced by her production company Wark Clements &amp; Co, including &quot;Words With Wark&quot;, &quot;Restless Nation&quot;, &quot;Building A Nation&quot; and &quot;Lives Less Ordinary&quot;.

In 2006, she presented a series of programmes on BBC television about countries on the continent entitled &quot;Tales from Old Europe&quot;. In June 2006 she interviewed Harold Pinter. Wark hosted the 10th annual Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards on 30 November 2007 for STV. She made a cameo appearance in the 2008 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;. She replaced David Baddiel as host of the BBC Four programme &quot;The Book Quiz&quot; in 2008 and hosted a BBC Two quiz show, &quot;A Question of Genius&quot;, which ran from 2009 to 2010. In 2011 she was chosen to host a BBC food quiz show entitled &quot;A Question of Taste,&quot; pitting two teams of food fanatics against one another.

Wark participated in the 2011 series of Celebrity MasterChef where she reached the final and narrowly lost out to Phil Vickery. On 1 January 2012, Wark appeared in a cameo role as herself in the revival of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. In January 2013 she appeared in a special series of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, where she was awarded Star Baker. Later that year, she made a cameo appearance in two episodes of &quot;The Politician&#x27;s Husband&quot; which aired on BBC Two.

Wark has been visible and vocal in the media about her experience of menopause and helped to raise awareness of this aspect of women&#x27;s health more widely. In 2017 she made a BBC documentary &#x27;Let&#x27;s talk about the menopause&#x27; because she felt that women are still &quot;shockingly ill-informed.&quot;

In 2018, Margarita Simonyan, the Russia Today journalist who interviewed the two Russian suspects of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal terminated an interview with Wark. It came after Wark challenged &quot;the manner of the interview&quot; and asked if the interview didn&#x27;t just reinforce the notion that RT was a &#x27;propaganda tool of the Russian state.&#x27; Simonyan said Wark&#x27;s questions seemed &quot;like typical Western propaganda.&quot; Since 2020, she has presented the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Reunion&quot;. She has also, on occasion, presented &quot;Start the Week&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

In 2021, Wark was one of the main presenters of the BBC&#x27;s election results coverage, alongside Huw Edwards. She presented from Edinburgh with the programme covering results from all the UK elections that took place on Thursday 6 May 2021, including the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and local council elections in England. On 19 October 2023 the BBC announced that Kirsty would be standing down as presenter of &quot;Newsnight&quot; after the next general election. The next general election was held on 4 July 2024 and Wark’s final day on Newsnight was Friday 12 July 2024. She presented the show as normal but towards the end of the programme actor Alan Cumming and Nick Watt (BBC Newsnight Political Editor) and others paid tributes to Wark, recognising her 30 years on the show. Tributes were also given from previous colleagues, her family and previous guests.

==Honours and awards==

Wark was named journalist of the year by BAFTA Scotland in 1993 and Best Television Presenter in 1997. She was also nominated for the prestigious Richard Dimbleby Award for Best Television Presenter (Factual, Features and News) in the BAFTAS 2000.

She was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013. Wark was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 2017.

In the June 2023 Graduation Ceremonies at University of St Andrews, Wark was awarded Doctor of Letters (DLitt), in recognition of her outstanding career in journalism and broadcasting.

==Public controversies==

Wark is regarded as being close to the Labour Party. Donald Dewar, Scottish Labour politician and former First Minister of Scotland, a close friend, appointed her to the Scottish Parliament Building Design Selection Panel, which chose Enric Miralles&#x27; design for the new parliament. Questioned by the Fraser Inquiry, set up to investigate the building&#x27;s cost overruns, she said: &quot;There was no way that we were making a decision on economically the most advantageous tender; you would have ended up with a shed . . . it was [about] getting a building which was the most exciting, innovative building . . .&quot; In 2003, Wark-Clements produced a film on the building, with critics accusing Wark of a conflict of interest.

In January 2005, she invited Labour MSP Jack McConnell, then Scotland&#x27;s First Minister, and his family to stay at her Majorcan holiday home over the New Year period. McConnell, a long-time friend of Wark and husband Clements before holding office, was cleared of any improprieties when the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Standards Committee deemed he received no financial benefits from the holidays. Wark&#x27;s editor on &quot;Newsnight&quot; offered his support, stating &quot;Many people in the media have friends who have gone on to hold office. The important issue is your ability to ask tough questions and that is not a problem with Kirsty Wark or anybody else on the programme.&quot;

Wark and Clements were the subject of media coverage regarding his use of Wark&#x27;s former personal assistant to monitor e-mails covertly at RDF Media after he left following an acrimonious dispute about a non-compete deal.

In June 2007, Wark clashed with Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond in an interview, over his response to a memorandum of understanding between the UK Government and Libya regarding prisoner exchanges. Salmond feared that this could include Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was convicted by a Scottish court in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. The BBC received 120 formal complaints, and issued a public apology to Salmond regretting Wark&#x27;s &quot;rude and dismissive&quot; tone; Salmond accepted the BBC&#x27;s apology. According to the BBC, viewers questioned the premise of the interview and that Wark&#x27;s line of questioning was too aggressive and therefore discourteous. According to &quot;Newsnight&quot; editor Peter Barron, time constraints forced Wark to end the questioning abruptly, leading him to perceive her behaviour as &quot;rude and dismissive&quot;.

In October 2013, Wark interviewed &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Glenn Greenwald about his reporting of the NSA and GCHQ cyber-spying programs leaked by Edward Snowden. The interview was seen as openly hostile in which &quot;Wark unabashedly made the case for the prosecution, interrogating Greenwald about his reporting and Edward Snowden.&quot; Greenwald later wrote that Wark and other journalists have focused &quot;almost entirely on the process questions surrounding the reporting rather than the substance of the revelations&quot; about NSA surveillance and privacy invasions &quot;and in the process made some quite dubious claims that come straight from the mouths of government officials&quot;.

On 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative MP, argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem (named &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;) at the end of BBC One transmissions each day (The practice was dropped in 1997, ostensibly due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete), to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain&#x27;s subsequent withdrawing from the European Union. At the evening of the same day, BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme ended its nightly broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were &quot;incredibly happy to oblige&quot; Rosindell&#x27;s request, and then played a clip of the Sex Pistols&#x27; similarly named song, much to Rosindell&#x27;s discontent.

Wark attracted further controversy in relation to Alex Salmond in 2020. She presented a documentary about Salmond&#x27;s trial on sexual assault charges, for which he was acquitted. The documentary aired several months after the end of the trial and featured both supporters and detractors of Alex Salmond reflecting on the case. Some of the women who accused Salmond spoke about the case for the first time. The programme received over 900 complaints from those who believed it was biased against Salmond. The BBC said that the outcome of the trial was &quot;fairly reflected in the programme&quot;, with the programme aiming to look at the wider political consequences of the case rather than rerunning Salmond&#x27;s trial. The BBC also said that Salmond had been asked to take part in the programme but had refused. The BBC said the programme contained Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill, who were supporters of Salmond. A later news story said that Salmond was considering taking legal action against the BBC, and possibly against Wark.

In October 2023 Wark was widely criticized when she interviewed Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom, a politician with no ties whatsoever to Hamas. Zomlot described how six of his family members had been killed by Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas war. Wark reacted this way: “I’m sorry for your own personal loss. I mean, can I just be clear, though, you cannot condone the killing of civilians in Israel, can you?”

==Books==
Wark has written two novels, &quot;The Legacy Of Elizabeth Pringle&quot; and &quot;The House By The Loch&quot;.

==Personal life==

Wark married television producer Alan Clements (born 1961) in September 1989, after meeting on the BBC Scotland programme &quot;Left, Right, and Centre&quot;. They have a daughter (born 1990) and a son (born 1992). They live in Kelvinside, Glasgow. They founded independent TV production company Wark-Clements in 1990, which in May 2004 was merged with fellow Scots broadcaster Muriel Gray&#x27;s Ideal World to form IWC Media. In December 2005, Wark and Gray severed their connections with IWC Media after RDF Media bought the company.

<text>Valerio Massimo Manfredi (born 8 March 1943) is an Italian historian, writer, essayist, archaeologist and journalist.

==Biography==
He was born in Piumazzo di Castelfranco Emilia province of Modena and, after getting a degree in Classical Arts at the University of Bologna, he became an archaeologist at the Catholic University of Milan, specialising in the topography of the Ancient World.

At the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore itself, he taught from 1980 to 1986, then moved on to an academic career at the University of Venice (1987) and then at the Loyola University of Chicago, the Sorbonne University in Paris and the Bocconi University in Milan. However, due to his numerous commitments, both national and international, he can no longer lecture full-time, but he holds a visiting professor role.

Between the 1970s and the 1980s, he has undertaken the &quot;Anabasis&quot; expeditions for the reconstruction of the itinerary of the Ten Thousand&#x27;s retreat. This expedition covered a total of 18,000 km, with 2,000 photographs being taken. He undertook and led numerous other expeditions, such as: Lavinium, Forum Gallorum and Forte Urbano in Italy, Túcume (Peru), Har Karkom and other overseas locations.

He has also held a series of conferences and seminars at the University of Oxford, University of California, National University of Canberra, Universidad de Antiochia, Universidad de Bilbao, Universidad Internacional Menendez Pelayo in Tenerife and many others.

He has published many academic essays and articles and he has written several best-selling novels (amounting to a total of about 8 million copies sold worldwide). He also writes on many newspapers and magazines as a scientific journalist both in Italy (e.g., &quot;Il Messaggero&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot;, &quot;Archeo&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot;) and in Spain (Spanish edition of &quot;Focus&quot; and &quot;El Mundo&quot;).

His novel &quot;The Last Legion&quot; was the basis for the movie of the same title, released in 2007 and starring Colin Firth, Ben Kingsley and others; his &quot;Alexander Trilogy&quot; has been bought by Universal Pictures for yet another cinematic rendition of the story of Alexander the Great. He has also written the screenplays for &quot;Marco d&#x27;Aviano&quot; and &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; and he has adapted &quot;Le Memorie di Adriano&quot; for cinema screening. Furthermore, he has hosted the television series &quot;Stargate – linea di confine&quot; for three seasons already on the Italian TV channel LA7 and he will also host &quot;Impero&quot; (&quot;Empire&quot;) on the very same channel.

On 11 February 2021, Manfredi and fellow writer Antonella Prenner were found unconscious at his home in Rome, after suffering a domestic incident caused by an accidental gas leak. They were hospitalized in Grosseto; their conditions were described as critical. They were later released.
