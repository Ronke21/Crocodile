<text>USS &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; (CVE-70) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after Fanshaw Bay, located within Cape Fanshaw, of the Alexander Archipelago in the Territory of Alaska. The cape was given its name by Charles Mitchell Thomas, who was mapping the area, in 1887. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in November 1943, and commissioned in December, and served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle off Samar, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in August 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in September 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and was designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate the movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the beginning of the Philippines campaign, and the Battle off Samar, she carried 16 FM-2 Wildcat fighters, and 12 TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft. However, during the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 6 TBM-3 torpedo bombers for a total of 30 aircraft.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 18 May 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1107, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 1 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Lorna V. Kenworthy, the wife of Captain Jesse L. Kenworthy Jr., who was the executive officer of the battleship during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. She was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 December 1943, with Captain Douglass Pollock Johnson in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; took on armaments at Port Townsend, Washington on 31 December, and proceeded on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast. During this period, she stopped at Port Angeles, Washington from 6 January 1944 to 8 January, along with another pause at San Francisco, California between 11 and 16 January, where she took on a load of aircraft. She was also assigned to become the flagship of Carrier Division 25, commanded by Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan. She departed from San Francisco on 16 January, ferrying her load to Gladstone, Queensland, arriving on 2 February. On her return trip, she touched at Brisbane from 8 to 12 February, and at Nouméa from 15 to 16 February.

Upon returning, she underwent maintenance and her crew underwent leave at San Diego from 4 March to 6 April. There, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; received her aircraft contingent, originally intended to be Composite Squadron 4 (VC-4), but switched to Composite Squadron 68 (VC-68), which consisted of 16 FM-2 fighters and 10 TBM-1C torpedo bombers. She departed San Diego on 6 April, accompanied by the seaplane tender , making a stop at Pearl Harbor on 10 April, and arriving at Majuro on 20 April. En route, on 11 April, one of her torpedo bombers crashed in an accident, with its crew being rescued by &quot;Orca&quot;. Upon arriving at Majuro, she began conducting antisubmarine patrols, along with the destroyer escorts , , and . Ten days of patrols returned no contacts, and she retired to Pearl Harbor.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===
On 29 May, she sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for Eniwetok Atoll, where she acted as the flagship of Task Group 52.14, which was assigned to support the upcoming Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. En route, two of her Wildcats were lost, and another was slightly damaged, through accidents. She began combat operations on 11 June, some west of Saipan, providing aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and antisubmarine patrols in support of the Battle of Saipan. On 15 June, at 17:15 in the late afternoon, the officers of &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; received a report of five Japanese aircraft proceeding towards her task group to her southwest. Fighters were scrambled, and the aircraft were intercepted away, harrying them as they quickly proceeded towards the carriers. Four of them were shot down, although a fifth aircraft was able to drop a torpedo aimed at &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; at 18:12. Fortunately for the carrier, the Japanese plane approaching from the starboard bow, perhaps disrupted by the anti-aircraft fire, dropped its torpedo at a slight turn. Therefore, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; engaged in a hard right turn, easily dodging the torpedo. The Japanese aircraft was subsequently shot down at 18:15.

On 17 June, one of &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s torpedo bombers conducting antisubmarine patrols crashed shortly after takeoff, veering port into the sea. A large explosion was triggered, likely from the detonation of one of the bomber&#x27;s depth charges, killing all three of its crew. Later that day, another torpedo bomber was lost, and although two of the crew were recovered, the radioman drowned with the aircraft. In the late afternoon, the task group detected about seventy Japanese aircraft approaching quickly from the southeast, out. Fighters were scrambled, and &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; launched fourteen Wildcats to supplement the thirty-two launched by the other escort carriers. Her fighters, intercepting the planes, shot down one. Nonetheless, the Japanese force penetrated the air screen, and made for the carriers. Early on in the attack, the Japanese planes focused on &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; and . Her anti-aircraft guns provided adept assistance, shooting down three planes, and damaging two more.
However, at 18:52, a Japanese bomber made a run for &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, dropping a bomb (believed to be ) as it flew about above the carrier. The bomb penetrated into her aft aircraft elevator, punching through the wooden decking, and detonating within the hangar bay, some below the flight deck. Shrapnel was launched through the hangar, instantly killing eleven men of Repair Party 3, which had taken up position forward of the elevator. Munitions were stored on both sides of the elevator, and shrapnel sliced through three torpedoes, although they failed to detonate. Nonetheless, the blast had enough force to rupture a fire main, sever electrical cables, and to even eject depth charges from the bomb bays of the Avengers stored within the hangar deck. In addition, several fires were kindled, total steering control was lost, and the ship acquired a 3° list to the port.

Although the fires were quickly put under control by the crew, several of her aircraft were compelled to land on other carriers as a result of the blazes. In the action, three planes from her aircraft contingent were lost in the turmoil, albeit there were no fatalities. Rear Admiral Bogan was also compelled to transfer his flag to the destroyer in order to more effectively lead the fleet. The rest of &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s damage was not so easily resolved. Steering control was not regained until 3:55 in the morning of 18 June. Of even greater concern to the ship&#x27;s officers was that of her list, with her stern sinking lower than design specifications. Originally, they believed that the ship&#x27;s outer skin had been penetrated, letting seawater in. Further investigation revealed that the cause for the list came from the ruptured fire main, which the damage control teams struggled to plug. Bogan, continuously frustrated by the progress of damage control, later complained in a 1969 interview that &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; was &quot;the worst ship [he’d] ever seen in any Navy&quot; and that &quot;the entire complement was incompetent.&quot; Regardless of opinions, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; suffered 14 dead and 23 wounded from the attack.

On 18 June, at 11:30 in the morning, her dead were buried at sea in a ceremony. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; retired from operations and proceeded to Pearl Harbor for a long period of repairs. Nonetheless, limited flight operations continued, with a fighter pilot perishing in an accident on 29 June.

===Battle of Morotai===
Upon finishing her repairs, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; continued acting as the flagship of Carrier Division 25, now under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague. After departing from Pearl Harbor, she arrived at Manus Island, of the Admiralty Islands. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, along with five other escort carriers and a screen of eight destroyer escorts, was assigned to Task Group 77.1, which would support the landings on Morotai. Notably, her aircraft contingent had been swapped, and she now hosted Composite Squadron 66 (VC-66). She departed Manus on 10 September, and she began air support operations on 15 September. On 17 September, two Avengers, one from &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, collided while moving into formation on an antisubmarine patrol. Of the six men involved, only a single survivor was recovered by the submarine chaser . On 19 September, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; lost another aircraft, with one of her Wildcats, diving on a Zero, missing and exploding on contact with the water. The carrier continued to hemorrhage aircraft, with an additional two fighters and a torpedo bomber crashing by 27 September.

On 3 October, the majority of the escort carriers had already retired, leaving only &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; and to continue operations. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; was preparing to retire back to Manus during the night. At the time, her task group was operating to the north of the island, when the Japanese submarine fired a spread of torpedoes towards the escort carriers. The first indicator of a torpedo attack occurred when a torpedo was spotted passing to the front of &quot;St. Lo&quot;, and off the port beam of &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;. Before maneuvers could be conducted, a second torpedo detonated on the destroyer escort , killing thirteen, and wounding twenty-two. The destroyer screen commenced dropping depth charges, forcing &quot;Ro-41&quot; away.

===Battle off Samar===
&quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; quietly retired back to Manus, where preparations began for the Philippines campaign. More specifically, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, as the flagship for &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, would be providing aerial cover for the planned landings on the island of Leyte. After a brief period of replenishment at Manus from 7 to 12 October, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; set off for the Philippines. En route, on 16 October, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; lost yet another aircraft to an accident, with one of her fighters wrecking itself on the flight deck, before being caught by an arresting cable, which resulted in the aircraft precariously dangling over her port side. Her crew, and after a short while, the aircraft, were subsequently recovered.

At the time of the invasion, Taffy 3 consisted of &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, &quot;St. Lo&quot;, &quot;White Plains&quot;, , , and , along with an accompanying screen of three destroyers and four destroyer escorts. As the U.S. fleet gathered off the Philippines, the Japanese garrison on Suluan managed to alert their command. This prompted Admiral Soemu Toyoda to launch Shō-Gō 1, a gambit to defend Japan&#x27;s access to the oil fields of Southeast Asia. On 18 and 19 October, Taffy 3 conducted strikes against Japanese bases located within Cebu, Negros, and Panay, destroying a total of thirty-eight planes, and damaging twenty-eight more. She then steamed off the island of Samar from 20 to 25 October, providing air support for U.S. forces onshore, and dropping leaflets on Japanese positions. In the meantime, Admiral William Halsey Jr. led his Third Fleet northwards, after spotting Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s diversionary Northern Force. Thus, the only ships covering the vulnerable landing crafts of Leyte Gulf were the three escort carrier task groups and their screens. Taffy 3, the northmost task group, would bear the brunt of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force as it swung through the San Bernardino Strait.

On the early morning of 25 October, Kurita&#x27;s Center Force had already crossed the San Bernardino Strait unmolested, and was entering the open waters of Leyte Gulf. &quot;White Plains&quot;″s radar had possibly spotted the Japanese force maneuvering into position at 3:00, but this information was disregarded by the ship&#x27;s command. Although World War II era surface radar was notoriously faulty, the speed and course of the spotted blip was consistent with the course set by the Center Force.
At 4:30, the escort carriers went to general quarters in preparation for another round of airstrikes and close air support. By 5:30, Taffy 3 had launched twelve fighters to conduct a combat air patrol, before launching another two Wildcats and four Avengers shortly afterwards. The task group continued launching aircraft throughout the morning. By the time of the attack, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; therefore only had twelve aircraft on hand, none of which were equipped to deal with heavily armed surface warships. The first indication of Japanese contact happened shortly after 6:30, when Taffy 3 experienced three almost simultaneous warnings. Firstly, they began receiving unencrypted Japanese chatter. Secondly, they spotted antiaircraft fire, estimated at to the north, where there was known to be no Allied surface presence. In fact, an Avenger from &quot;St. Lo&quot; had stumbled into the midst of the Japanese fleet, and began radioing Rear Admiral Sprague warnings. Thirdly, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s radar operators spotted an unmistakable surface signature of unknown surface ships just away.

Upon coming to an understanding of the severity of the situation, Sprague ordered Taffy 3 to steam eastward, in hopes of being shielded by a passing rain squall. At 6:52, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; launched the remaining twelve of her planes, which consisted of a single Wildcat, and eleven Avengers. Of the Avengers, ten were carrying a single semi-armor piercing bomb, and one was carrying two depth charges. Sprague also radioed for assistance from Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, the commander of Task Group 77.2, which had just defeated the Southern Force in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Unfortunately for Sprague, Oldendorf was at least three hours sail away, Task Group 77.2 was scattered over an immense distance because of the previous night&#x27;s battle, and it was low on both fuel and ammunition. Taffy 3 would have to confront the Center Force by itself.

&quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; and &quot;White Plains&quot; were located on the west flank, and therefore bore the opening volleys of the engagement. Beginning at 6:58, both of the carriers came under fire from the Japanese task group, which was situated about away. The Japanese were firing dye-marked shells to gauge their aim, and the escort carriers were, much to the concern of their command, straddled in plumes of colored water. The officers would certainly be more concerned if they were able to correspond the color of the dyed water to that of a particular Japanese ship, as plumes of red, green, blue, purple, pink and yellow dyed water started to dot the ocean. Unbeknownst to the crew, the pink dyes corresponded to the Japanese battleship , with its guns, the largest ever manufactured, and the yellow dyes corresponded to the Japanese battleship , with its guns. Fortunately for &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s crew, as the shells slowly creeped up to her stern, she happened across a passing rain squall at 7:03, reducing visibility to just .

At the same time that &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; was being harried by shells, the twelve aircraft that she had launched, joined by four fighters which had been on patrol, commenced attacks against the leading Japanese ships. Their attacks were mostly ineffective, mostly due to their light armaments and a general lack of coordination. The task group emerged from the rain squall by 7:23, but it was not until 7:50 that &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; came under concentrated fire again. At 7:50, four shells made impact with her hull, with another two missing just in front of her bow. One shell penetrated through a ventilator, killing two men as it tore into the carrier. Another shell passed under one of her Bofors guns, tearing the face off of one of her crew. Deflected by the gun&#x27;s shield, the shell ricocheted over her flight deck. Another shell destroyed her catapult track, and resulted in a small explosion within her flag office. Four small fires had been kindled by these shells, but they were quickly put under control, along with a minor issue with flooding. Although four men had been killed in the attack, her operational capability was not significantly compromised. Rather, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s gun responded by firing against one of the leading Japanese cruisers, landing at least five hits against its superstructure.

&quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; continued whilst under concentrated fire for the next hour, conducting a variety of evasive maneuvers. At 8:35, with the task force weaving back and forth, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; had a close call with the destroyer , narrowly avoiding a collision. Despite the addition of smoke screens, and the heroic defense of her escorts, by 8:55, the Japanese had already closed the distance to only . During the intervening period, the Japanese shells had sparked a series of fires, which the damage control parties struggled to contain, and the situation seemed to be deteriorating. She was also forced to dodge torpedo attacks launched by the Japanese destroyer screen. Fortunately for her crew, Admiral Kurita, discouraged by the dogged defense of Taffy 3 and his losses, harried by constant air attacks, and believing that he was facing an equal or perhaps a superior force, was convinced to withdraw. At 9:25, to the bewilderment of Rear Admiral Sprague, the Japanese fleet turned around and retired.

In the chaos of the action, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; lost four Wildcats and an Avenger. In addition, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was severely damaged and sunk as a result of Japanese naval gunfire, with her survivors being left behind by the beleaguered task force. As Taffy 3 retired to the southeast following the engagement, five Japanese kamikaze Zeroes, along with four escorting fighters, were spotted at 10:51. The first kamikaze aimed for &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, but its aim was off, only clipping the carrier before detonating over the flight deck and plunging into the ocean. The second and third planes went for &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;. The first plane to approach was shot down by her gun, and it nosedived into the ocean. However, one of its bombs still exploded some from her hull, sending shrapnel across the carrier. As the other kamikaze maneuvered into a position to strike the ship, it was shot down a safe distance from the carrier by her anti-aircraft gunners. The fourth kamikaze proceeded towards &quot;White Plains&quot;, but only clipped the carrier, inflicting minor damage. The fifth kamikaze plunged towards, and sunk &quot;St. Lo&quot; with the loss of 113 lives. Even more kamikazes attempted to follow on the successful attack on &quot;St. Lo&quot;, but accurate anti-aircraft fire and an effective fighter screen ensured that the carriers sustained no more substantial damage.

With her destroyer screen detached to recover the survivors of &quot;St. Lo&quot;, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; retired towards Manus, recovering aircraft from the action throughout the day. At the end of the day, the carrier&#x27;s crew had suffered four dead, and four wounded, with three having to be transferred to for treatment ashore. Arriving at Manus on 1 November, she replenished until 7 November, and proceeded back to the West Coast, making a stop at Pearl Harbor. She arrived at San Diego, where repairs were made for the damage sustained in the Battle off Samar. On 10 January 1945, Captain Murr Edward Arnold took over command of the vessel. In addition, a new aircraft contingent, Composite Spotting Squadron 2 (VOC-2), was embarked upon the carrier. Upon finishing repairs, she steamed for the waters off of Hawaii, where training operations were conducted, along with routine patrols.

===Battle of Okinawa===

After finishing training, she sailed westwards to Ulithi, arriving on 14 March. There, she was designated as the flagship of Carrier Division 26, under the command of Rear Admiral Sprague. Preparations were made for the upcoming landings on Okinawa. On 21 March, she departed for Okinawa, and her aircraft began combat operations on 25 March. Her planes supported the initial landings on 1 April, providing extensive close air support, and neutralizing Japanese positions. On 7 April, Rear Admiral Ernest Wheeler Litch took over command of Carrier Division 26. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; remained on station off of Okinawa for sixty-nine consecutive days, and her air contingent flew 2,089 sorties in the battle, claiming five Japanese planes. Throughout the operation, she witnessed near constant kamikaze attacks, with some 1,465 Japanese kamikazes involved.

Following a short period of replenishment at San Pedro Bay, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; again returned to Okinawa, arriving off of the Sakishima Islands on 9 June to continue launching airstrikes. She continued these operations until 27 June, when she was assigned to Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral Alexander Sharp. Consisting of 107 minesweepers, seven minelayers, and seven netlayers, the Task Force began minesweeping operations within the East China Sea, beginning on 5 July. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, along with three other escort carriers, provided an aerial screen for the minesweepers, and launched strikes against targets situated around the mouth of the Yangtze River on 28 July. On 30 July, she withdrew from the operations, having assisted the minesweepers in clearing 404 mines over , with no loss in ships, despite the occasional Japanese submarine or plane.

&quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; anchored within Nakagusuku Bay, where she endured further kamikaze and submarine incursions. She then steamed for Guam and Eniwetok, where she loaded aircraft. She was assigned to Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher&#x27;s Ninth Fleet, which was operating off of the Aleutian Islands. As she departed from Eniwetok, she received news of the Japanese surrender on August 15.

===Post-war===
With the conclusion of offensive operations, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; proceeded northwards, mooring at Kuluk Bay, Adak Island. There, she joined Task Force 44, and sailed southwards to assist in the Japanese occupation. She operated off of Japan between 31 August and 9 September, covering troops as they landed on Hokkaido. After the formal signing of surrender by the Japanese garrison on Hokkaido on 9 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 24 September.

At Pearl Harbor, she joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops and returning U.S. servicemen back to the mainland, sailing a total of along the way, and with an average of 1,400 passengers on-board during each journey. She first steamed for San Francisco, arriving on 20 October, took on passengers at Pearl Harbor on 27 October, and returned her passengers to San Diego on 4 November. She then made a trip to Japan, arriving at Tokyo Bay on 28 November, returning to the West Coast on 18 December, where she was discharged from the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet.

Following release, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; sailed northwards, arriving at Port Angeles, Washington, on 26 January 1946. Inactivation work began at Tacoma on 29 January, and she was decommissioned on 14 August. She was mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, and she was redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier whilst in reserve on 12 June 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and sold for scrapping on 29 August to Hyman-Michaels Co., Chicago. She was ultimately broken up in Portland, Oregon, later that year. &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service, and along with the rest of Taffy 3, received the Presidential Unit Citation for conduct during the Battle off Samar.

<doc id="554011" wikidata="Q7870209" url="?curid=554011" title="USS Hoggatt Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; (CVE-75) was the twenty-first of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Hoggatt Bay, which was named in 1895 by Lieutenant commander E. K. Moore after Wilford Bacon Hoggatt, an ensign serving in Moore&#x27;s party at the time. The bay is located within Baranof Island, part of the Alexander Archipelago, which at the time was a part of the Territory of Alaska. She was launched in December 1943, commissioned in January 1944, and she served in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf as a part of the Philippines campaign, as well as the Battle of Okinawa. Post-war, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She was decommissioned in July 1946, being mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was broken up in 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier (Type S4-S2-BB3), the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and was designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. She was based on a heavily modified P1 hull, which was standardized with all of her sister ships. She was long overall, have a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. Four Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers powered two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two screws, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty Oerlikon cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 16 FM-2 Wildcat fighters and 12 TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission (MC) contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 17 August 1943 under the name &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1112, the twenty-first of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She received the classification symbol CVE-75, indicating that she was the seventy-fifth escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. She was launched on 4 December 1943 and sponsored by Mrs. Esther Irene Sundvik, the wife of a Victor Sundvik, a shipwright at the yard; transferred to the Navy and commissioned on the morning of 11 January 1944, with Captain William Vincent Saunders in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; spent the month of January undergoing outfitting at U.S. Naval Ship Yard Tongue Point, Astoria, Oregon. She then underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast, heading to Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. She arrived at San Diego on 23 February, and spent the early half of March conducting gunnery and air-defense drills off of the California coast. She left San Diego on 10 March, ferrying a complement of aircraft and passengers to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 16 March, returning to the West Coast on 25 March, where she took on her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron (VC) 14, on 26 March. On 27 March, aircraft operations began, with Saunders making the first landing. She spent April undergoing an overhaul, heading westwards on 1 May to conduct antisubmarine operations around the vicinity of Emirau Island in the Bismarck Archipelago.

===Marianas and Palau Islands campaign===

Stopping at Pearl Harbor on 8 May, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; then proceeded for Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 11 May, assigned to Escort Division (CortDiv) 39, otherwise known as Task Unit 16.14.6. En route, her aircraft spotted a possible submarine signature on 16 May, which they attacked with little apparent result. She moored at Majuro from 17 to 21 May, before departing on 22 May to be a part of an antisubmarine patrol, operating south of Truk Atoll of the Caroline Islands. Navy codebreakers had intercepted Japanese communications indicating the establishment of a seven submarine scouting line (referred to as the NA line), stationed approximately northeast in the Admiralty Islands in order to safeguard against a possible thrust towards the Palau Islands. By 26 May, when &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; rendezvoused with the division, it had already sunk five Japanese submarines, four of them from the NA line. With &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s escorting destroyers joining in, the group formed Task Group 30.4, a dedicated antisubmarine hunter-killer formation. On the early morning of 31 May, the claimed her sixth submarine kill in thirteen days.

On 3 June, Task Group 30.4 moored at Manus in the Admiralty Islands to restock and replenish. Putting back to sea on 4 June, the task group received an aerial contact of a surfaced submarine to the north of its search area on 8 June. Thus, the task group proceeded northwards, and on 10 June, one of &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s Wildcats sighted an oil slick approximately west of the escort carrier. The &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyer was dispatched to investigate, and soon received a strong sonar contact, the . &quot;Taylor&quot; dropped two depth charges, and at 15:41, the submarine surfaced in front of the destroyer. It was quickly engaged by &quot;Taylor&quot;″s guns, with the submarine sustaining heavy damage before diving again at 15:46. After another round of depth charges, two large underwater explosions were heard at 15:58, with a large air bubble rising up to the surface afterwards, confirming the submarine&#x27;s destruction.

On 19 June, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; returned to Manus, before proceeding to Eniwetok in the Marshalls, staying there for a period of four days to replenish. On 1 July, the escort carrier set out to conduct another antisubmarine patrol. Shortly after midnight, on July 19, one of VC-14&#x27;s aircraft spotted a surface signature, the . The and the &quot;Buckley&quot;-class were dispatched to investigate, with &quot;Wyman&quot; receiving a clear sonar contact. As the destroyer escorts dropped their second round of depth charges, a large explosion was felt, shattering &quot;I-5&quot;, the force of which shattered the lights on &quot;Wyman&quot; as she went in for a third round.

After replenishing at Eniwetok from 22 to 25 July, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; set out for her third antisubmarine patrol on 26 July. At 17:31 in the evening of 28 July, a lookout spotted a surfacing submarine, what was probably the , approximately to &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s starboard. The surfacing may have been accidental, or the submarine&#x27;s crew may have been unaware of its position, as no personnel were observed manning the deck guns throughout the course of the engagement. &quot;Wyman&quot; and &quot;Reynolds&quot; were sent to intercept the submarine, with &quot;Wyman&quot; turning to fire its guns, shelling the submarine for a period of two minutes, whilst &quot;Reynolds&quot; charged in to drop depth charges, a procedure that was halted due to &quot;Wyman&quot;″s precise battery. As &quot;Reynolds&quot; approached and the submarine sank below the surface, a series of explosions were heard, and an oil slick formed at the surface.
After finishing her patrol, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; was detached from Task Group 30.4 and spent August in replenishment at Eniwetok and Kwajalein, before arriving at Manus as a part of the newly formed antisubmarine Task Group 30.7, escorted by the &quot;Evarts&quot;-class destroyer escorts , , and , as well as the . The task group was assigned to antisubmarine operations protecting the various ships that were engaged in the Battle of Peleliu and the Battle of Angaur, a task which it conducted through September and October. At 03:11 in the early morning of 3 October, the radar operators of &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; detected a surface signature approximately away from the carrier. &quot;Samuel S. Miles&quot; was detached to investigate, and discovered it to be the . As the destroyer escort closed to within , the submarine dove, and thirteen minutes later, having established sonar contact, &quot;Samuel S. Miles&quot; fired her first volley using her Hedgehog mortars. Following the second run, a series of three large explosions rocked the destroyer escort, communicating the submarine&#x27;s destruction.

===Philippines campaign===

&quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; replenished at Manus from 9 to 12 October, before departing for Palau. She served as an escort for the and the , both of whom had been damaged by aerial torpedo hits during the Battle of Formosa. &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; and her escorts served as a deterrent against submarine attack, and was credited with thwarting at least one attempt to strike the damaged cruisers.

After spending the latter half of October and the beginning of November undergoing replenishment and maintenance at Ulithi, she spent November providing an air screen and conducting antisubmarine patrols for ships operating in support of the ongoing Battle of Leyte. On 29 November, whilst moored at Manus, VC-14 was rotated off the carrier, and Composite Squadron (VC) 88 came aboard the carrier. She spent December conducting amphibious exercises in Huon Gulf in preparation for the planned Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, a task assigned to Task Force 77, which &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; joined at Manus. On 22 December, Captain Josephus Asa Briggs assumed command of &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; whilst she was replenishing at Manus. On 27 December, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;, as well as the rest of Task Force 77, left Manus for Luzon. Pausing at Kossol Roads on 31 December, the formation saw its first of many kamikaze attacks on 3 January 1945, with a plane shot down just from &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;.

As the kamikaze threat intensified, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s fighters were scrambled almost constantly. However, it was not until 13 January that she found herself directly menaced, after a kamikaze, aiming for her sister ship and dissuaded by heavy anti-aircraft fire, switched its destination for &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;. As it dove, it was greeted by a direct hit from her 5-inch gun, which tore the plane into shreds. After arriving in Lingayen Gulf on 6 January, the air contingent of &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; began conducting close air support for the landing infantry. On 15 January, an Avenger, piloted by VC-88&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant commander E. N. Webb, found itself unable to release one of its bombs during a close air support mission. As the Avenger came to a stop on &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s flight deck, the bomb detonated, killing thirteen onboard and wounding fourteen others. A fire broke out, but was quickly extinguished. Harder to remedy was the noticeably concave flight deck, but nonetheless, flight operations resumed within three hours.

===Battle of Okinawa===

&quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; was ordered to retire to Ulithi on 17 January, arriving on 23 January. There, her aircraft contingent was detached, and she was sent back to the West Coast for further repairs, overhaul, and conversion into a proper flagship, arriving back at San Diego on 15 February. On 2 April, Rear Admiral Harold M. Martin, commander of Carrier Division 23, raised his flag over the vessel. On 6 April, she departed the West Coast for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 13 April. There, she took on a load of aircraft and vehicles, which she unloaded at Guam in the Mariana Islands on 28 April. On 1 May, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 99 at Saipan, and after a short period of exercises, she departed on 8 May for Okinawa, in support of the ongoing battle.

On 12 May, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; commenced air operations over southern Okinawa, conducting a variety of services, such as providing air screening, photographic reconnaissance, supply drops for isolated units, as well as generalized close air support. She kept up this work throughout May and June, with only brief stops at Kerama Retto for replenishment. On 5 June, she braved Typhoon Connie, in which the carrier rolled up to 27°, and gusts of up to were observed. On 7 June, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; was attributed with shooting down a kamikaze gunning for her sister ship . During the same action, a different kamikaze, aiming for yet another of &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s sisters, , was shot down just off of &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s starboard bow. By the time &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; had retired from operations on 24 June, VC-99 had conducted 1,327 sorties, dropped of bombs, and fired more than a thousand rockets.

===Post-war===
&quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; arrived at Leyte on 27 June, where she replenished and restocked. After conducting some training exercises off Samar from 17 to 21 July, she left for Adak, Alaska on 11 August to join Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher&#x27;s Ninth Fleet, which was operating off of the Aleutian Islands. En route, on 15 August, news of the Surrender of Japan reached the ship. She moored at Kuluk Bay from 18 to 30 August, before departing on 31 August for Mutsu Bay, where Fletcher received the formal surrender of Japanese forces in northern Honshu and Hokkaido on 6 September. Arriving on 7 September, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; conducted air patrols and dropped supplies for American ex-prisoners of war. On 14 September, Captain Frederick Norman Kivette took over command of the vessel.

On 15 September, Lieutenant Colonel James Devereux, who had received a Navy Cross for his conduct during the Battle of Wake Island, was taken onto &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;, where he was expeditiously airlifted back to the United States. On 18 September, she rode out Typhoon Ida, and for the latter half of September, she covered the landings of contingents of the Eighth Army in Aomori. She then proceeded southwards into Tokyo Bay on 28 September, where Rear Admiral Martin departed the ship. She left Tokyo Bay on 29 September, escaping the path of Tropical Storm Kate. She entered Apra Harbor on 4 October, and was at Pearl Harbor by 14 October. She arrived at San Francisco on 21 October, where her aircraft contingent, VC-99, was detached. The following day she put into Richmond, where she was assigned to the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. At Richmond, conversion into a troopship went into effect, with 704 bunk beds being installed within her hangar deck.

&quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot;″s first Magic Carpet trip began on 3 November, when she headed westwards, bound for Pearl Harbor. Midway through, her destination changed to Saipan, and she ferried approximately 1200 passengers back to the West Coast, sailing into San Pedro on 7 December. Her second trip started on 13 December, arriving at Buckner Bay on 1 January 1946. Taking on some more passengers at Guam on 13 January, she steamed into San Francisco on 28 January. There, on 30 January, Captain Marvin Pabodie Evenson took over command of the vessel. Whilst moored at San Francisco, she was discharged from the Magic Carpet fleet, and assigned to join the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She took on five SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and four F4U Corsair fighters, as well as 450 marines at San Francisco, and sailed for San Diego on 11 February. She unloaded her cargo on 12 February, where another load of aircraft was taken on. After transiting the Panama Canal, she unloaded her aircraft at Jacksonville, Florida on 7 March. She then proceeded northwards, stopping at Norfolk, Virginia on 17 March, before entering Boston, Massachusetts on 20 March.

After arriving, &quot;Hoggatt Bay&quot; was decommissioned and mothballed on 20 July 1946, joining the Boston group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, mooring at the South Boston Naval Annex. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a helicopter aircraft carrier, receiving the hull symbol CVHE-75. On 7 May 1959, she was further redesignated as an aviation transport, receiving the hull symbol AKV-25.

<text>Fort Tenedos was a large earth-walled fort constructed on the Zulu side of the Tugela River in January 1879, opposite Fort Pearson, to support the British at the start of the Anglo-Zulu War.

== Construction ==
On 2 December 1878 Captain W. R. C. Wynne embarked in command of the 2nd Field Company of the Royal Engineers for Natal, part of the small number of reinforcements sent to the colony ahead of the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. The company joined the first column under Colonel Charles Knight Pearson at the mouth of the Tugela River on 12 January and the following day crossed the river with them. In the presence of the Zulu, Wynne with his company of Royal Engineers, assisted by the line, laid out and built Fort Tenedos on the left (Zulu) bank of the Lower Tugela. The earthwork fort, large enough to shelter the entire column and a quantity of stores, was completed between 13 and 17 January. It was named Fort Tenedos after the British warship , anchored off the mouth of the Tugela. Her crew formed part of the Naval Brigade.

== Defences ==
The fort&#x27;s armament consisted of two guns from the Royal Artillery, two 7-pounder guns with the Naval Brigade, and a Gatling gun. Local British units consisted of the 91st Highlanders, Natal Hussars, the Durban Mounted Rifles, Alexandra Mounted Rifles, Stanger Mounted Rifles, and the Victorian Mounted Rifles. There were also some 2,200 Natal Natives formed into two battalions of the 2nd Regiment, Natal Native Contingent, and a company of Durnford&#x27;s Natal Native Pioneer Corps. These men were recruited from local African tribes hostile to the Zulus.

<text>USS &quot;Tripoli&quot; (CVE-64) was a of the United States Navy. &quot;Tripoli&quot; is the first US Navy ship named for the Battle of Derne in 1805. It was the decisive victory of a mercenary army led by a detachment of United States Marines and soldiers against the forces of Tripoli during the First Barbary War. It was the first recorded land battle of the United States fought overseas.

==Construction==
She was built under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract (MC hull 1101) at Vancouver, Washington, and was laid down by the Kaiser Shipyards on 1 February 1943, as Didrickson Bay (ACV-64). Renamed &quot;Tripoli&quot; on 3 April 1943, and launched on 13 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Leland D. Webb, and commissioned on 31 October 1943, at Astoria, Oregon.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Following shakedown training off the California coast, the escort carrier entered the repair base at San Diego, California. There, on 4 January 1944, gasoline was inadvertently dumped into the water around the forward part of the ship, on the starboard side. Acetylene torch sparks ignited the volatile mixture, and flames quickly spread from the bow to frame 82, engulfing the forward galley walkway and the island superstructure. Yardcraft and the ship&#x27;s crew battled the flames and soon had the fire under control, but not before two men had died.

====Atlantic====
Subsequently repaired, &quot;Tripoli&quot; departed San Diego on 31 January, bound for the Panama Canal and duty with the Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia on 16 February. Embarking Composite Squadron 13 (VC-13) - 13 Grumman FM-2 Wildcats and Grumman TBM Avengers - the carrier put to sea on 15 March as the center ship in Task Group 21.15 (TG 21.15). Supported by five destroyer escorts of Escort Division 7 (CortDiv 7), &quot;Tripoli&quot; patrolled west of the Cape Verde Islands to break up German U-boat refuelling activities in that area.

After providing air cover for a convoy routed to the British West Indies, &quot;Tripoli&quot;″s Wildcats and Avengers searched the sea lanes northwest, southwest, and west of the Cape Verdes before putting into Recife, Brazil on 5 April, to refuel and provision. Back at sea again two days later, &quot;Tripoli&quot; continued the routine of daily launchings and recoveries of her aircraft, guarding the Allied sea lanes against the incursions of enemy U-boats.

About one hour before sunrise on 19 April, one of &quot;Tripoli&quot;″s Avengers made radar contact with a German U-boat as the submarine cruised on the surface awaiting the arrival of her &quot;Milch Cow&quot; or refuelling partner. put up a spirited anti-aircraft barrage while the Avenger made three attacks. A pattern of rockets bracketed the submarine on the first pass as the Germans prepared to dive for comparative safety. On the second run, the aircraft&#x27;s depth charges failed to release, giving the enemy submersible the time she needed to dive. The U-boat evaded the aircraft&#x27;s last attack - a mine - but also missed her fuelling rendezvous with .

Returning to Norfolk on 29 April, &quot;Tripoli&quot; underwent voyage repairs before embarking VC-6 - 12 Avengers and nine Wildcats. She then formed up with CortDiv 7 and departed Hampton Roads on 24 May for further searches in the vicinity of the Cape Verdes. Four days out, she changed course to intercept a German submarine estimated to be proceeding southwest from a position west of the Madeira Islands. When no contact was made by 30 May, &quot;Tripoli&quot; and her consorts steamed north to rendezvous with a convoy bound for Nova Scotia.

Following her return to Norfolk on 18 June, &quot;Tripoli&quot; spent two months in carrier qualification training off Quonset Point, Rhode Island, before making port again at Norfolk on 15 July. Embarking Composite Squadron 6, she conducted two weeks of pilot qualifications in the Chesapeake Bay area before departing Hampton Roads on 1 August, bound for her new base of operations, Recife.

Screened by and , the escort carrier proceeded south until 1 August, when &quot;O&#x27;Toole&quot; developed a sonar contact and gave chase. Aircraft from &quot;Tripoli&quot; laid patterns of sonobuoys at the initial contact point and dropped smoke floats and float lights on an oil slick. Picking up the &quot;scent&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Toole&quot; straddled the floats with her Hedgehog projectiles and depth charges and soon radioed victoriously &quot;We hit the rodent!&quot; A brief visual examination of the evidence - debris and a large quantity of diesel oil - satisfied the hunter-killer group that they had indeed sunk an enemy submarine. However, a post-war examination of German records did not confirm the kill. As night fell, &quot;Tripoli&quot; vectored two aircraft to another sonar contact by &quot;O&#x27;Toole&quot;, and four depth bombs were dropped - keeping another U-boat down and running.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; and her group then returned to Recife on 13 August, and reported for duty with Admiral Jonas H. Ingram&#x27;s 4th Fleet. Designated as the center of TG 47.7, the escort carrier put to sea on 22 August with the four destroyer escorts of CortDiv 24 to operate against a homeward-bound German submarine estimated to pass at 25° south latitude and 5° west longitude.

After a fruitless search pursuing two fading sonar contacts in the mid-South Atlantic narrows, &quot;Tripoli&quot; and her group returned to Recife on 11 September for provisioning and fuelling. Underway again two days later, TG 47.7 headed out to conduct another search - this time along the estimated track of two U-boats slated to rendezvous for refuelling. One of the target U-boats was , bound from Penang, British Malaya with a cargo of valuable petroleum products for the German war effort. Ordered to fuel, outward-bound for the Far East, &quot;U-1062&quot; prepared to rendezvous with her smaller sister boat in the South Atlantic narrows - directly in the path of the &quot;Tripoli&quot; escort group.

Passing to the westward of the Cape Verdes, TG 47.7 made rendezvous with ″s escort group to conduct a joint hunter-killer operation against the two enemy boats. Round-the-clock searches by radar-equipped Avengers continued until 40 minutes after sunset on 28 September, when an Avenger piloted by Lieutenant William R. Gillespie reported a definite contact with the surfaced &quot;U-219&quot; only 11 miles from the enemy&#x27;s estimated track.

Gillespie went in to conduct a low-level rocket attack, but was shot down by heavy flak. Another Avenger, drawn to the battle, braved the flak to conduct another rocket run and also dropped depth bombs, while a Wildcat strafed the U-boat which struggled desperately to dodge the harassing attacks by the American aircraft.

&quot;U-219&quot; emerged from the firefight unscathed, but &quot;U-1062&quot; did not enjoy similar good fortune. , one of &quot;Mission Bay&quot;″s screen, homed in on sonobuoy indications on 30 September and sank the &quot;Milch Cow&quot; with a four-charge pattern. In the meantime, &quot;U-219&quot; was not yet home free - one of &quot;Tripoli&quot;″s Avengers dropped depth bombs on the fleeing boat on 2 October. American sonar-men felt that they had definitely &quot;killed&quot; the U-boat, but post-war accounting showed that &quot;U-219&quot; had escaped to Batavia, Java.

When fuel supplies ran low, &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to Recife on 12 October. She conducted one further search of the narrows from 26 October-12 November before heading for a much-needed overhaul at Norfolk. Subsequently, the escort carrier sailed for the Pacific and, after transiting the Panama Canal and touching at San Diego, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945.

====Pacific====
&quot;Tripoli&quot; transferred Composite Squadron 8 ashore to conduct operations from Hilo, Hawaii, before she loaded a miscellaneous cargo of fighters and bombers to be offloaded at Roi, in the Marshall Islands, where she made port on 20 February 1945. Returning to Pearl Harbor after this ferry run, the escort carrier commenced training operations which would continue through the end of the war, and into late 1945. With Japan&#x27;s surrender and the end of hostilities in the Pacific, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet.

Arriving at San Diego on 29 August, with 500 Navy veterans, &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 September, before resuming local operations - including night carrier qualifications - through November. She subsequently made one trip with Army passengers to San Pedro, California, and a further &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; run to San Diego. The carrier departed the west coast on 15 January 1946, for deactivation overhaul at Norfolk. On 22 May 1946, the need for her services not required, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was decommissioned and laid up in reserve.

===Korean War===
The outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950 resulted in the return of many of the Navy&#x27;s reserve ships to active service to support American operations in the Far East. Accordingly, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was recommissioned at New York on 5 January 1952. Assigned to the Military Sealift Command (MSC), Atlantic Area, the former &quot;hunter-killer&quot; began her new career as an aircraft transport and ferry.

Over the next six years, &quot;Tripoli&quot; conducted 44 transport voyages, mostly to European and Mediterranean ports, but with one visit to Hawaii and two to the Far East. Following the ship&#x27;s third voyage to Europe, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was berthed at the Port Newark Terminal on 5 August 1952, where she loaded 45 F-84 Thunderjets, 90 wingtip fuel tanks, and related gear for transport to the Far East. After going to sea on 7 August, bound for Japan, &quot;Tripoli&quot; steamed via the Panama Canal and San Diego and made port at Yokosuka with her vital cargo on 5 September, where cranes lifted the reinforcements ashore - soon to be in action in their ground-attack role in Korea. After loading battle-damaged aircraft for repairs in the United States, the carrier embarked 245 Navy and Marine Corps personnel for rotation back to Alameda Naval Air Station, California. Making port on the West Coast on 22 September, she then put to sea for the Far East a second time, once again carrying jet aircraft to Yokosuka, as well as transporting men of the Sea Echelon of Boat Unit 1. Loading a cargo of helicopters and military passengers, &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to the west coast and arrived at Alameda on 11 November 1952. Subsequently making her sole Hawaiian voyage with the MSC, &quot;Tripoli&quot; then headed east to finish her career with transport voyages to European and Mediterranean ports.

At Alameda May 1954, fifty F-86D aircraft were loaded on board &quot;Tripoli&quot; and cocooned for a 21-day trip thru the Panama Canal to St Nazaire, France. 13 June approx 500 US Air Force personnel of the 440th FIS from Spokane WA and 441st FIS from Hamilton AFB in San Francisco, CA boarded the ship. One source identifies the units as the 496th Fighter Squadron from Hamilton AFB, and the 440th from Geiger Air Force Base. On 2 July the ship arrived at the port of St Nazaire, France. The two squadrons were bound for Landstuhl AFB, Germany.

Receiving &quot;smart ship&quot; awards from in the intervening years, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was reclassified a utility carrier and redesignated CVU-64 on 12 June 1955. Again redesignated T-CVU-64 on 1 July 1958, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was decommissioned at New Orleans, La., on 25 November 1958 and subsequently struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1959. Her hull then scrapped by a Japanese firm in January 1960.

<text>USS &quot;Tulagi&quot; (CVE-72) was a of the United States Navy.

She was laid down on 7 June 1943 at Vancouver, Washington, United States, by the Kaiser Company, Inc., as &quot;Fortazela Bay&quot; (ACV-72); and redesignated CVE-72 on 15 July 1943. However, her name was corrected to read &quot;Fortaleza Bay&quot; on 19 October 1943, and the ship was renamed &quot;Tulagi&quot; on 6 November 1943; launched on 15 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. James Duke Earner; and commissioned on 21 December 1943, Capt. Joseph Campbell Cronin in command.

==Service history==
The new escort carrier got underway from Seattle on 17 January 1944 bound for San Francisco where she was immediately pressed into service ferrying stores, airplanes, and military personnel to Hawaii. She departed Pearl Harbor for the homeward voyage on 29 January and arrived at San Diego with her load of passengers on 4 February. Throughout most of February, she participated in training exercises out of San Diego before steaming, via the Canal Zone, for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Following her arrival at Norfolk on 17 March, &quot;Tulagi&quot; underwent overhaul and carrier qualification tests.

&quot;Tulagi&quot; embarked a load of Army Air Forces planes late in May and departed New York on the 28th in convoy with two other carriers and their screen. On 6 June, &quot;Tulagi&quot; entered her first foreign port as she steamed the swept channel approach to Casablanca. After disembarking her cargo, the carrier took on passengers including a group of 35 prisoners of war and then headed home.

After arriving at Norfolk on 17 June 1944, &quot;Tulagi&quot; got underway late in June for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where she embarked personnel, planes, and equipment. On the last day of the month, she departed Narragansett Bay with Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin on board as Commander, Task Group 27.7, and steamed eastward conducting squadron and battery training en route to Oran, Algeria. &quot;Tulagi&quot; visited Malta on 26 July and then spent the following weeks conducting exercises, which included a dress rehearsal out of African and Italian ports for the coming Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France.

On D-Day, &quot;Tulagi&quot; steamed in formation 45 miles off the invasion beach; and, at 0546, she launched her first flight of F6F Hellcats. In the next week, aircraft from &quot;Tulagi&quot; flew a total of 68 missions and 276 sorties, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. Weather was generally good as carrier-based planes conducted spotting missions and made strikes at various targets ashore, including gun emplacements and railway facilities. On 21 August, &quot;Tulagi&#x27;s&quot; last day in support of Operation &quot;Dragoon&quot;, German forces were in retreat before the Allied thrust. &quot;Tulagi&quot;&#x27;s fliers conducted a devastating attack along the line of march of a German convoy which snarled the roads for miles around Remoulins and crowned her achievements of the day by downing three German Junkers Ju 52s.

After taking on supplies and fuel at Oran, she got underway for home on 6 September. Following a quick overhaul at Norfolk, the escort carrier set her course for Panama; transited the Canal; and arrived at San Diego on 26 October. There, she embarked two air squadrons for transportation to Hawaii and departed the west coast on 29 October 1944.

Following her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 5 November, the carrier participated in antisubmarine warfare and gunnery exercises. On the 24th, she got underway in company with a special antisubmarine task group which conducted sweeps as it steamed via the Marshalls and Ulithi for Saipan. Throughout December, &quot;Tulagi&quot; continued antisubmarine activities in the Palaus and the southern Marianas.

On the first day of the new year, 1945, &quot;Tulagi&quot; got underway for Lingayen Gulf and the impending invasion of Luzon. Meanwhile, the Japanese in the Philippines had assigned more than 100 suicide planes for a concerted attack on &quot;Tulagi&#x27;s&quot; task force. The convoy passed through Surigao Strait into the Mindanao Sea on 3 January. In the following three days, the kamikazes took their toll. On the 4th, reports of enemy aircraft in the area became more frequent; and, late in the afternoon, a suicide plane crashed while trying to dive into . Moments later, observers on &quot;Tulagi&quot; saw the conflagration which marked the death throes of , the victim of another kamikaze. On the morning of 5 January, enemy air attackers continued to menace the convoy as it steamed through Mindoro Strait and into the South China Sea. Although fighters from the carrier shot down two Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, three enemy aircraft succeeded in penetrating the defenses of the convoy. Two were shot down, but one managed to crash into , a member of the convoy&#x27;s screen.

When landing began at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945, &quot;Tulagi&quot; launched her planes for air strikes on land targets, anti-snooper patrols, and air cover for American vessels. On 12 January, &quot;Tulagi&quot; supplied air support for the Lingayen Gulf beachhead; and, the next day, her port battery shot down a suicide plane which had singled out the carrier for destruction. Before it crashed, the attacker, deflected from &quot;Tulagi&quot; by withering anti-aircraft fire, crossed astern and to starboard of the escort carrier and vainly attempted to dive into an alternate target. On 17 January, the Army Air Force assumed responsibility for direct air support of American operations in Lingayen Gulf; and &quot;Tulagi&quot;&#x27;s fliers turned their attention toward the Zambales coast where they provided cover for support and protection of forces near San Narcisco. On 5 February, &quot;Tulagi&quot; arrived at Ulithi after a grueling period of sustained flight operations during which her planes had been in the air for all but two of 32 days.

&quot;Tulagi&quot; departed Guam on 21 February to conduct hunter-killer exercises in support of the assault on Iwo Jima before joining a task unit in &quot;area Varnish&quot; west of Iwo Jima on 1 March. She supplied air support and antisubmarine patrols until departing the area on 11 March, bound for Ulithi. Arriving there on 14 March, she prepared for the invasion of the Ryukyus.

Assigned alternately to antisubmarine and direct support activities, &quot;Tulagi&quot; operated continuously off the coast of Okinawa from the end of March until early June. On 3 April, four Zeros attacked her formation, and all were shot down. On the 6th, while &quot;Tulagi&quot; was anchored at Kerama Retto for rearming, a Japanese air attack penetrated air space over the harbor. The carrier took one of her attackers under fire at 4,000 yards, but the Japanese plane came harrowingly close before turning aside to dive into a nearby LST which burst into flames 200 feet high. Minutes later, &quot;Tulagi&quot; shot down another attacker and chased off a third with her accurate fire. The next day, &quot;Tulagi&quot; resumed her station off Okinawa, providing planes for air strikes called in by ground observers and for running photo-reconnaissance and patrol missions. On the 13th, after she launched a special strike against the airfields of Miyako Jima, she began antisubmarine operations along the shipping lanes approaching Okinawa.

Following this long and arduous tour, &quot;Tulagi&quot; arrived at Guam on 6 June 1945. The carrier departed the Marianas on the 8th, bound for San Diego. She remained on the west coast throughout the summer undergoing overhaul, trials, and training. Peace came while she was at San Diego, but she departed the west coast again on 4 September and steamed via Hawaii for the Philippines. At Samar, she embarked planes for transportation back to the United States and reached Pearl Harbor in October. After returning to San Diego in January 1946, the veteran escort carrier reported to the 19th Fleet at Port Angeles, Washington, on 2 February 1946 for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 30 April 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 8 May 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Tulagi&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; (CVE-81) was the twenty-seventh of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Rudyerd Bay, within Ketcchikan Gateway Bourough, of the Territory of Alaska. Today, the bay lies within Misty Fjords National Monument. The ship was launched in January 1944, commissioned in February, and served as a replenishment and transport carrier throughout the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign. Later, she served as a frontline carrier, providing air cover and support for the invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in January 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, at the waterline, she was long, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Power was provided by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 15 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, and a TBM-1CP reconnaissance plane for a total of 27 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 24 October 1943 under the name &quot;Kaita Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1118, the twenty-seventh of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was launched on 12 January 1944; sponsored by the wife of Captain Scott Ernest Peck; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 25 February 1944, with Captain Curtis Stanton Smiley in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to Southern California, where she took on a load of aircraft, which she ferried to Espiritu Santo of the New Hebrides throughout April and May. Upon returning to the West Coast, the carrier conducted qualification exercises off the California coast until July, before making another transport run to Majuro, in the Marshall Islands from 20 July to 26 July, escorted by the destroyer escort . After finishing her mission, she embarked Composite Squadron 77 (VC-77), departing on 8 August for the West Pacific. At Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, she joined Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group, which at the time, consisted of seven escort carriers (including &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot;), seven destroyers, fifteen destroyer escorts, and twenty-four replenishment oilers, organized into eight task units. She then proceeded with the task group to Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, arriving on 31 August.

Throughout early September, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; served as a replenishment carrier, providing replacement aircraft (from VC-77), parts, and supplies for the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force of the Third Fleet, which at the time was supporting the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. Later, during October, she continued supporting the fast carriers as they operated in support of the Philippines campaign. &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; was still a part of Task Group 30.8, now renamed the At Sea Logistics Group. The fleet oilers had been detached, and the number of escort carriers involved had increased to eleven. On 18 October, the carrier took on the wounded of the light cruiser , which had been subjected to two separate aerial torpedo hits. She transported them to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, and by November, the carrier was back to replenishment duties, which would eventually take her into Typhoon Cobra.

On 17 December 1944, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; was a part of Task Unit 30.8.12, alongside her sister , which was acting as the flagship. The two escort carriers were screened by the destroyer escorts and . By then, the Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel, and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 01:00, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded.
As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10. He ordered his fleet to move to the next morning&#x27;s planned rendezvous spot, approximately northwest, and comfortably safe from the typhoon&#x27;s impacts. Two hours later, he instead ordered his fleet to proceed due southwards, from where the fleet was located. This brought the fleet directly into the typhoon&#x27;s core. To make matters worse for the Third Fleet, Halsey ordered the fleet to proceed northwards at 22:20, putting the fleet in the quadrant of the typhoon with the highest winds. Blurry data and observations meant that command had little idea of where the typhoon actually was, with some weather maps pinning the typhoon&#x27;s center some away, even whilst the fleet sailed directly into the eye. Attached to the Third Fleet, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; followed.

At 07:00, on the morning of 18 December, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon&#x27;s path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 07:22, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; came to course at 60°, along with her sisters and &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot;. &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; struggled to maintain its course as it battled with high winds and waves cresting over the flight deck. At 10:17, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; radioed that she was dead in the water, albeit control was quickly regained.

Nonetheless, all appearances suggest that &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; passed through Typhoon Cobra relatively intact and without much damage, given the fact that on 19 December, Halsey found it judicious to assign upon her and her sister , the task of combing through the area looking for survivors. On 20 December, at 05:00, the carrier was the first to report to Halsey that the destroyer had capsized, with the loss of most of its crew. At 08:40, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot;, along with her screens, relieved the destroyer escort , which had been conducting search and rescue operations for fifty straight hours.

Upon concluding rescue operations, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; steamed back to Ulithi, where the destroyer escorts unloaded the survivors of the &quot;Spence&quot;. On 28 December, the escort carrier, accompanied by &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot;, several oilers, and various other ships, departed Ulithi, voyaging westwards to continue their replenishment role in support of the Philippines campaign. The carrier was situated in the Philippine Sea, until 10 January 1945, when she moved north to the South China Sea, in order to better support the fast carriers as they participated in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf and conducted strikes against Japanese shipping stretching from Indochina to Formosa. On 22 January, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; left replenishment duty, transiting via the Sulu Sea, Mindanao Sea, and Leyte Gulf, before docking at Ulithi.

&quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; remained at Ulithi until 10 February, when she left for Saipan, in the Mariana Islands, in preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima. During this time period, Captain John Golden Foster Jr. took over command of the carrier. On 16 February, she left the Mariana Islands, as a part of Task Group 51.17, along with . The two carriers were responsible for providing air cover and escorting the troop transports as they ferried marines to the shores of Iwo Jima. Finishing this duty without incident on 18 February, the two carriers joined Task Group 52.2, the Support Carrier Group, as a part of Task Unit 52.2.3, which was under the command of Rear Admiral George R. Henderson.

&quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot;″s aircraft contingent, VC-77, began flying missions in support of the marines on 19 February, as U.S. forces began touching down on the island&#x27;s beaches. These missions were expected to include reconnaissance missions, flown by VC-77&#x27;s sole TBM-1CP reconnaissance plane. However, after the plane had just taken off on its first mission, at 09:14, a scant twelve minutes after the first U.S. forces had touched down on the island, the Avenger had a large Japanese shell tear into it, turning the plane into a fireball and killing VC-77&#x27;s commanding officer, LCDR Frank Peterson. Prior to Annapolis, he had enlisted in the marines and said that a Navy pilot was not going to fly the first flight of a Marine invasion. Nonetheless, VC-77 continued providing close air support and conducting antisubmarine patrols around Iwo Jima until 8 March, when &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; retired for Ulithi.
Whilst &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; was stationed at Ulithi from 11 March to 20 March, her aircraft contingent was exchanged, with Composite Squadron 96 (VC-96) being embarked in preparation for the Battle of Okinawa. On 21 March, the carrier got underway, as a part of Task Unit 52.1.2, which was under the command of Rear Admiral Felix Stump. She arrived at her position on 25 March, about to the south of Okinawa, where she began launching strikes against enemy positions on Kerama Retto and on Okinawa itself. &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot;″s aircraft contingent, with the exceptions of 1 April and 8 April, operated daily until 17 April. From 13 to 15 April, VC-96 concentrated on the Sakishima Islands, where a squadron of Japanese kamikaze aircraft were being launched.

Throughout these operations, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; witnessed a steady stream of both kamikazes and conventional Japanese aircraft make attacks on the escort carriers. For example, on the late afternoon of 2 April, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot;″s fighters were scrambled when two kamikazes attacked her sister , with an extreme near-miss tearing a large hole in the starboard side of the carrier. As the sun set, one of VC-96&#x27;s fighters shot down a Mitsubishi A6M Zero, and as the Japanese planes disengaged, eight of her fighters were forced to make night landings, even though none of the pilots had been night-qualified. In the ensuing mayhem, two Wildcat fighters and an Avenger on the flight deck were rendered as complete losses, with four more planes being severely damaged, albeit remarkably, none of the pilots were killed or seriously injured.

On 17 April, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; was rotated to Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group, for a 10-day period of relative rest, although her aircraft were still responsible for providing an air screen for the replenishment carriers. She was rotated back to Task Group 52.1 on 27 April, whereupon she continued providing close air support. She was rotated again to Task Group 50.8 on 8 May, providing air cover until 20 May, when she retired from the Ryukyu Islands. By then, VC-96 had flown 1,257 sorties in support of the battle on Okinawa.

Proceeding eastwards, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; arrived on Guam on 23 May, where she detached her aircraft contingent, VC-96, and embarked Composite Squadron 85 (VC-85) for transport back to the West Coast. Upon arriving back in the United States, she underwent overhaul, which took until the end of July. Upon the completion of overhaul, she was reassigned to plane ferry duty, which began on 1 August, when she ferried a load of aircraft from Naval Air Station Alameda to the Marshall Islands. Whilst she was still midway in her ferry mission, the Japanese surrender was announced. Nonetheless, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; continued onwards, unloading cargo and passengers at Enewetak, before heading to Ulithi and the Philippines, and moving Composite Squadron (VC-33) to Okinawa. She then took on another aircraft squadron, which she transported back to the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco on 8 October.

There, &quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; underwent repairs and modifications in order to better accommodate troops, before being assigned to the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She made Magic Carpet runs for the rest of 1945, into the new year, finishing her final trans-Pacific run on 23 January 1946. On 18 February, she left dock at California, bound for the Eastern seaboard. She transited through the Panama Canal on 28 February, unloaded some aircraft at Jacksonville, Florida in early March, and steamed north to Boston, where inactivation work was commenced.

&quot;Rudyerd Bay&quot; was decommissioned on 11 June, and mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, as part of its Boston group. Docked at the South Boston Naval Annex, she was reclassified as a utility carrier (CVU-81) on 12 June 1955. She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport (AKV-29) on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1959, and sometime in January 1960, she was sold to Cantieri Navali Santa Maria, which broke her up in Genoa, Italy throughout 1960. Rudyerd Bay&#x27; received five battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>The Tau Beta Pi Association (commonly Tau Beta Pi, , or TBP) is the oldest engineering honor society and the second oldest collegiate honor society in the United States. It honors engineering students in American universities who have shown a history of academic achievement as well as a commitment to personal and professional integrity. Specifically, the association was founded &quot;to mark in a fitting manner those who have conferred honor upon their Alma Mater by distinguished scholarship and exemplary character as students in engineering, or by their attainments as alumni in the field of engineering, and to foster a spirit of liberal culture in engineering colleges&quot;.

==History==
When academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa sought to restrict its membership to students of the liberal arts in the late 19th century, Edward H. Williams Jr., a member of Phi Beta Kappa and head of the mining department at Lehigh University, formulated the idea of an honor society for those studying technical subjects. Irving Andrew Heikes, the valedictorian of his class at Lehigh, was initiated as the first student member of Tau Beta Pi on June 15, 1885. A statue on Lehigh&#x27;s campus commemorates this event.

In 1892, a second chapter was established at Michigan State University. Since then, the association has grown to 257 collegiate chapters across the United States and Puerto Rico. Tau Beta Pi was a founding member of the Association of College Honor Societies. The national headquarters of Tau Beta Pi is located in Knoxville, Tennessee on the campus of the University of Tennessee.

Although Tau Beta Pi never discriminated on the basis of race or religion, Tau Beta Pi did make its start as a male-only society. Female engineering students were scholastically eligible for Tau Beta Pi as early as 1902; however, those women were not granted membership. Starting in 1936, TBP awarded a &quot;women&#x27;s badge&quot; to exceptional female engineering students, and a total of 619 women&#x27;s badges were awarded until 1969. In 1969, Tau Beta Pi began granting women full membership in the society.

In 1974, the Sigma Tau fraternity merged with Tau Beta Pi. Sigma Tau was an honor society for engineering much like Tau Beta Pi and was founded at the University of Nebraska in 1904. At the time of the merger, Sigma Tau consisted of 34 collegiate chapters and a total membership of 45,000. The basis of the merger of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Tau was the conviction that a single, strong honor society would better serve the engineering profession. Tau Beta Pi awardees are not normally considered for membership in Phi Beta Kappa, and vice versa, owing to differences in the subjects for demonstrating distinction emphasized by each society. The honor they confer is equivalent.

In 2011, the society had 237 active chapters, sixty alumni clubs, and 526,414 total initiates,

== Symbols ==
The colors of Tau Beta Pi are seal brown and white, which are the school colors of Lehigh. The official badge, called the Bent, is a watch key in the shape of the bent of a trestle. The trestle is the load-bearing part of the bridge, representing Tau Beta Pi&#x27;s principle of Integrity and Excellence In Engineering. Originally, the keys could be used to wind watches. However, because watches have since been fabricated with their own winding mechanisms, modern keys do not have this ability. When using the Bent, members must adhere to strict guidelines regarding the exact dimensions of the trestle in order for the Bent to be a valid representation. The symbols on the Bent at the top and the bottom are an ancient form of Greek letters. The quarterly magazine of Tau Beta Pi is also titled &quot;The Bent&quot;.
The logo of Tau Beta Pi was revised and approved at the 2019 Convention in Columbus, Ohio. The new logo features the Bent inside a circle, with the words &quot;Tau Beta Pi / The Engineering Honor Society&quot; either to the right or underneath the symbol and is available in either blue or seal brown on a white background. The old logo, which featured a tilted 3D Bent and the words &quot;Tau Beta Pi / The Engineering Honor Society&quot; in a lighter blue color was discontinued in October 2019. A logo for Pi Day was developed in 2016 and features a black seal with white text &quot;Tau Beta Pi / The Engineering Honor Society / Pi Day&quot; centered around the image of the bent in the middle. The digits of pi wrap around the edge of the seal.

==Chapters==

There are 261 chartered Tau Beta Pi Collegiate Chapters; 255 are active, 6 are inactive.

== Membership ==
There is now only one &quot;class&quot; of members in Tau Beta Pi, the former classifications of Member with Distinction, Honorary Member, and Associate Member having been discontinued. Election to membership in the association is accomplished only by vote of a collegiate chapter, and members&#x27; chapter designations are always those of the chapters that elected them. Members&#x27; class numerals are those of the years in which they received the engineering degrees on which their eligibility was based, although members with no engineering degree are designated by the year in which they were initiated. Candidates eligible for consideration for election to membership by a collegiate chapter fall into five general categories:

# Undergraduate students. 
# Graduate students. 
# Alumni of the chapter&#x27;s institution who were eligible as students.
# Alumni of other institutions who were eligible as students.
# Engineers of high attainment in the profession, regardless of college attended, scholastic record, or educational background.

=== Undergraduate eligibility requirements ===
Undergraduate students whose scholarship places them in the top eighth of their engineering class in their next-to-last year or in the top fifth of their engineering class in their last college year are eligible for membership consideration. These scholastically eligible students are further considered on the basis of personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity. At least 50% of a student&#x27;s coursework must have been completed by the time of their invitation to the society. Students must be pursuing at least one major within their college&#x27;s engineering school; for this reason, some Computer Science students may or may not be eligible for membership depending on if Computer Science is counted in the engineering school or the liberal arts school at their respective university, for example. Some chapters may set a scholastic-grade deadline below which candidates are not considered, such deadline being higher than that required as a minimum by the Constitution. Elections and initiations are normally held twice a year, in the fall/winter or spring terms of the chapter&#x27;s institution. Student electees who are financially unable to meet the initiation-fee obligation may make delayed payment arrangements with their chapters, may borrow from the association&#x27;s loan fund, or may accept election but postpone initiation for up to five years.
=== Graduate eligibility requirements ===
Engineering graduate students whose scholarship places them in the top fifth of their graduate class and have completed at least 50% of their coursework or whose high-quality work is attested to by a faculty member may be elected to membership. Engineering alumni of a chapter&#x27;s institution or of another recognized institution whose scholastic record placed them in the top fifth of their class may be elected to membership. Such candidates are usually recommended to the chapter by a member who knows them. In all cases the requisite scholastic attainment makes candidates eligible for membership consideration. They are further considered on the basis of the association&#x27;s exemplary character requirement.

=== Eminent engineer eligibility requirements ===
Persons who have achieved eminence in engineering may be elected to membership without regard to collegiate records. If they graduated from a recognized engineering college, they must have been engaged in engineering for at least 10 years; if not, they must have practiced engineering for at least 15 years. Such candidates are usually recommended by members who know them. The required degree of eminent achievement is left to the chapters&#x27; discretion; and candidates are further considered on the basis of exemplary character.

===Historical requirements===
Prior to the fall of 1941, Tau Beta Pi&#x27;s scholastic requirements were that eligible candidates stand in the top eighth of the junior class, but in the top quarter of the senior class. The classes graduating in 1942 were thus the first to be admitted under the higher requirement. Until 1969, membership in Tau Beta Pi was limited to men, although qualified women were offered an award called the Women&#x27;s Badge. From its authorization in 1936 until its elimination by the admission of women to membership, 619 Women&#x27;s Badges were awarded by 98 chapters. Those women later were offered full membership by their chapters after Tau Beta Pi initiated its first female members in 1969.

=== Membership verification ===
Tau Beta Pi membership catalogs were published in 1898, 1911, 1916, 1926, 1932, and 1939. The 1946 Convention authorized discontinuance of them because of the excessive cost and limited usefulness. Today, membership can be verified online.

=== Membership benefits ===
Tau Beta Pi members gain access to a variety of benefits for life after initiation, including access to applying for $2000 scholarships for rising seniors (about 50% acceptance rate) and $10,000 fellowships for graduate students (about 10% acceptance rate), a private LinkedIn group of alumni, the opportunity to attend the annual national convention (with sponsored travel for voting delegates) and participate in a Tau Beta Pi-only recruiting fair, and graduation stoles and cords for members in good standing during their graduation. Members also receive automatic entry-level advancement of US Gov applicants to GS-7* 4 and member-only lifetime discounts from companies like Geico, Dell, SIRVA Home, PPI for FE/EIT and PE exams, and hotels around the world.

== Activities ==
Tau Beta Pi has an active fellowship and scholarship program supported by alumni members and other supporters. Some of the results of these programs are:
* 3,629 students have received scholarships for their senior year of engineering study since 1998.
* 1,736 students have been given Fellowship stipends exceeding $8,000,000 since 1929.
* 1,784 students have borrowed more than $862,000 from the educational loan program since 1932.

=== MindSET program ===
One initiative provided by Tau Beta Pi is the &quot;MindSET&quot; (Math, Science, Engineering, Technology) K-12 program. This program is designed to foster interest in engineering among elementary, middle, and high school students with classroom and hands-on activities. The goal of MindSET is to have students completing algebra by 8th grade and calculus by 12th grade. MindSET was first conceived by Dr. Jonathan F. Earle as &quot;GatorTRAX&quot;, a program run by the Florida Alpha chapter, and is now a national program with more than 50 active projects across the country.

<doc id="554022" wikidata="Q7871514" url="?curid=554022" title="USS Marcus Island">
<text>USS &quot;Marcus Island&quot; (CVE-77) was the twenty-third of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after an engagement on 31 August 1943 over Minami-Tori-shima, known on American maps as Marcus Island. She was launched in December 1943, commissioned in January 1944, and she served in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Philippines campaign, as well as the Battle of Okinawa. She spent the majority of her World War II as a flagship for various escort carrier formations, serving as the headquarters for Rear Admiral William D. Sample and Felix Stump. During the Philippines campaign, she participated in the Battle off Samar, the largest naval engagement in history, and during the Battle of Mindoro, she had multiple near-brushes with Japanese kamikazes. Post-war, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in December 1946, being mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was broken up in 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Marcus Island&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and was designed specifically to be rapidly mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size limited the length of the flight deck and necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the number of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; carried 16 FM-2 Wildcat fighters and 12 TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft. At the beginning of the Philippines campaign, she carried 17 FM-2 Wildcats and 12 TBM-1C Avengers for a total of 29 aircraft. During the Battle of Mindoro, she carried 24 FM-2 Wildcats and 9 TBM-1C Avengers for a total of 33 aircraft. This increase in fighter capabilities was due to the threat of kamikaze attacks. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 26 FM-2 Wildcats and 9 TBM-1C Avengers for a total of 35 aircraft. By the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 20 FM-2 Wildcats, 11 TBM-3 Avengers, and a TBM-3P photo-reconnaissance plane for a total of 32 aircraft.

==Construction==

Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. She was laid down on 15 September 1943 under the name &quot;Kanalku Bay&quot;, under Frank Knox&#x27;s directive naming escort carriers for &quot;sounds, bays, and islands&quot;. She was laid down as MC hull 1114, the twenty-third of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. On 6 November 1943, she was renamed to &quot;Marcus Island&quot; as part of a modified convention that set escort carriers to be named after &quot;sounds, bays, and islands, and famous American battles&quot;. She was launched on 16 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. S.L. LaHache; transferred to the Navy and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 26 January 1944, with Captain Charles F. Greber in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast. Upon its completion, she began transporting aircraft from the West Coast to bases in the South Pacific, with her first ferry mission starting on 19 May. Finishing her transport run on 1 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 21, and departed westwards from San Diego on 20 July.

====Marianas and Palau Islands campaign====
She arrived in Tulagi of the Solomon Islands on 24 August, where she joined Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group. As Task Unit 32.7.1&#x27;s flagship, Rear Admiral William D. Sample raised his flag over &quot;Marcus Island&quot;. Her task group was assigned to provide close air support for the marines participating in the planned landings on Peleliu and Angaur of the Palau Islands, as a part of the larger Mariana and Palau Islands campaign.

&quot;Marcus Island&quot; commenced pre-invasion strikes on 12 September, softening up Japanese positions on Peleliu and Angaur. &quot;Marcus Island&quot; began close air support operations on 15 September, the day of the landings. On the first day of the landings, her aircraft contingent lost an Avenger along with its pilot in combat, although losses were generally light for the rest of the battle. She continued providing air cover and launching strikes until 2 October, when she retired to Manus of the Admiralty Islands, arriving on 4 October.

====Philippines campaign====
=====Battle of Leyte=====

At Manus, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; joined Task Group 77.4, the escort carrier group tasked with supporting the return to the Philippines as part of the Seventh Fleet. She maintained her status as a flagship for Task Unit 77.4.2, also known as &quot;Taffy 2&quot;. She, accompanied by eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, steamed on 12 October for Leyte Gulf, where they were expected to support the landings on Leyte. &quot;Taffy 2&quot; was positioned to the direct south of &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, which was positioned to the east of the San Bernardino Strait. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the Sixth Army had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days. On that day, Rear Admiral Sample insisted on accompanying one of &quot;Marcus Island&quot;″s Avengers as it conducted a close air support mission, and was wounded by shrapnel when the aircraft had a shell penetrate and explode within its fuselage. During the initial landings, the &quot;Marcus Island&quot;″s air contingent flew 261 sorties over Leyte.

======Battle off Samar======

On 23 October, the Battle of Leyte Gulf began. The majority of the Japanese naval fleet had been concentrated in an attempt to repel the Americans from the Philippines, the seizure of which would have cut the vital oil supply lines from Southeast Asia. Vice Admiral William Halsey Jr., commander of the Third Fleet, detached his surface ships to engage the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, on the early morning of 25 October, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force emerged into the waters of Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some north of &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, by surprise.

With &quot;Taffy 3&quot; helplessly overmatched, the entirety of Taffy 2&#x27;s aircraft was recalled to join the defense. &quot;Marcus Island&quot; only had a single Avenger available, as the rest had been sent to airdrop supplies to the 96th Division. By the time these Avengers returned, the battle had already concluded. Nonetheless, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; dispatched all her available aircraft, and her sole Avenger recorded a torpedo hit on the portside aft of what was probably the . Her fighters strafed and bombed the advancing Japanese ships, recording fourteen hits and shooting down five Japanese planes. &quot;Marcus Island&quot; was also obliged to refuel and rearm seven Avengers originating from &quot;Taffy 3&quot; which had been diverted.

While the American forces had been distracted with the Battle off Samar and its immediate aftermath, Vice Admiral Naomasa Sakonju&#x27;s six ship transport unit was in the process of unloading 2,000 troops onto Ormoc Bay, on the Western coast of Leyte. After unloading the troops in the morning of 26 October it was sighted while attempting to retire westwards. A strike group of twenty-three Avengers and twenty-nine fighters was assembled to strike the Japanese ships. &quot;Marcus Island&quot; contributed twelve of its aircraft to the strike group, and the strike group reached the Japanese ships at 10:00 in the morning, sinking one and crippling another, which later sank.

=====Battle of Mindoro=====

On the morning of 30 October, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; and three of her sister ships withdrew from Leyte towards Manus, having been reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, still maintaining her status as flagship. Throughout the month of November, she provided air cover for convoys traveling near the eastern Philippines, which had been harassed by Japanese planes based on Mindanao. In late November, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; left Seeadler Harbor for Kossol of the Palau Islands. On 10 December, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; steamed for Mindoro as a flagship for Task Unit 77.12.7, providing air screening for the Mindoro attack group.

On 15 December, during the morning of the Mindoro landings, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; and her sisters came under intense kamikaze attack. At around 4:30, about 40 Japanese aircraft, divided approximately in half between kamikazes and escorts, began taking off from Clark Field and Davao to engage Task Group 77.12. At 8:00, TG 77.12 began turning back towards Leyte, having been relieved of their duties covering the landing forces by Army Air Forces aircraft, but the Japanese kamikazes pursued closely.
At 8:22, three kamikaze Zeros were spotted approached &quot;Marcus Island&quot; from the port quarter, at about in altitude, when one Zero disappeared into a cloud, and the other two reoriented themselves towards her. One Zero crossed over the carrier towards her starboard quarter, whilst the other one made a steep bank to remain at her port. The first kamikaze skimmed over her flight deck, making impact with the water just off her starboard bow, glancing a lookout platform and killing one. Scarcely ten seconds after the first attack, the second Zero dove on &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, but careened into the water off her port bow. As it entered the water, its bomb detonated, spraying shrapnel across the flight deck and injuring six of her crew. A few minutes later, a Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber attempted to make a run against &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, but it missed with its bomb and was shot down. &quot;Marcus Island&quot; was able to continue her air support operations on Mindoro.

=====Invasion of Lingayen Gulf=====
&quot;Marcus Island&quot; retired from operations off of Mindoro on 16 December, returning to the Admiralty Islands on 23 December. There, she joined Task Unit 77.4.4, the San Fabian Protective Group as its flagship, which was assigned to participate in the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, assisting the Sixth Army as it landed on Luzon. Task Unit 77.4.4 was responsible for providing air screening for Task Force 78, the San Fabian Task Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey. During the night of 4–5 January 1945, as TF 78 passed through the Surigao Strait, it encountered two Japanese midget submarines. As one of the midget submarines raised its periscope to look around, a plane from &quot;Marcus Island&quot; dropped a depth charge onto it, leaving it dead in the water and with a severe list. It was finished off by an escorting destroyer, which rammed it.

&quot;Marcus Island&quot; arrived in Lingayen Gulf on 6 January, where she provided an air screen to fend off kamikazes. On the morning of 8 January, her morning patrol of fighters a group of Japanese planes, shooting down four. Nonetheless, a kamikaze damaged . On 10 January, &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; was ordered to transfer her entire stock of aircraft to &quot;Marcus Island&quot; and withdraw. During time period, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; averaged to a launching or landing every 3.8 minutes of operations, setting a record for an escort carrier in combat. On 9 January, as the landings proceeded, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; assisted in providing close air support, sinking two small Japanese coastal on the north shore of Luzon. As a result of casualties, on 10 January, the screening escort carriers were reconstituted into Task Unit 77.4.6, the Close Covering Carrier Group.

On 17 January, &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, along with the rest of Task Group 77.4, retired from the waters off of Luzon, joining Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey&#x27;s Close Covering Group, stationed west of northern Mindoro. On 29 January, she supported unopposed landings at Zambales in Luzon, before heading to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, arriving on 5 February. En route, Captain Howard Vaniman Hopkins took over command of the vessel. On 6 February, Rear Admiral Sample left &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, and she embarked Rear Admiral Felix Stump, commander of Carrier Division 24. At Ulithi, she unloaded VC-21 and took on Composite Squadron (VC) 87 on 14 February. She spent the rest of February conducting training, before heading for Leyte Gulf in early March to conduct rehearsals for Operation Iceberg, the planned landings on Okinawa.

====Battle of Okinawa====

&quot;Marcus Island&quot; departed Ulithi on 21 March, as the flagship for Task Unit 52.1.2. She arrived south of Kerama Retto on 26 March, where she commenced air operations. On 5 April, Composite Observation Squadron (VOC) 1, which had previously been operating onboard &quot;Wake Island&quot; was embarked by &quot;Marcus Island&quot;. In turn, she exchanged her aircraft contingent to &quot;Wake Island&quot;, which had been damaged by a kamikaze, to be ferried back to Guam.

On 29 April, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; left Okinawa in a convoy along with her sisters and . During the Battle of Okinawa, planes of her air contingent had flown 1,085 sorties, shooting down 11 Japanese aircraft and destroying another 13 grounded aircraft. She took on a load of damaged aircraft at Guam, steaming on 5 May for the West Coast, arriving back at San Diego on 22 May. She sailed westwards again on 10 July, ferrying troops and replacement aircraft to Pearl Harbor and Guam. She returned to Naval Air Station Alameda on 15 August, the same day that the Surrender of Japan was announced.

===Postwar===
At Alameda, &quot;Marcus Island&quot; was assigned to the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. Her first Magic Carpet trip went to Okinawa, making stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, arriving in San Francisco on 24 October. For the rest of 1945, she conducted more Magic Carpet runs to Guam and Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Marcus Island&quot; left San Diego on 12 January 1946, transiting the Panama Canal and stopping at Norfolk, before arriving in Boston Harbor on 2 February. On 12 December, she was decommissioned and mothballed, joining the Boston group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, mooring at the South Boston Naval Annex. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a helicopter aircraft carrier, receiving the hull symbol CVHE-77. On 7 May 1959, she was further redesignated as an aviation transport, receiving the hull symbol AKV-27. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1959, and she was sold for scrapping on 29 February 1960 to Comarket Inc. She was ultimately broken up in Japan during June 1960. &quot;Marcus Island&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>The Oregon [[tax revolt]] is a political movement in Oregon which advocates for lower taxes. This movement is part of a larger anti-tax movement in the western United States which began with the enactment of Proposition 13 in California. The tax revolt, carried out in large part by a series of citizens&#x27; initiatives and referendums, has reshaped the debate about taxes and public services in Oregon.

==Major figures==
The leaders of the tax revolt include Don McIntire, president of the Taxpayer Association of Oregon, and Bill Sizemore, leader of Oregon Taxpayers United. Much of the money spent to promote these anti-tax measures were provided by out-of-state backers including Americans for Tax Reform headed by Grover Norquist.

Tim Knopp, a Republican lawmaker from Bend, was the main author of the “kicker” tax rebate and the later successful effort to place it in the Oregon Constitution. He is the former House majority leader and as of 2024, Senate Minority Leader.

== National context and the passage of Measure 5 ==
Oregon voters placed limits to property tax in the Oregon Constitution in 1990 with the passage of Measure 5. A majority of voters were frustrated by the increase in property taxes attributed to rapidly rising property values in the Portland area. Some attribute this home price inflation to an influx of population in the Portland metro, which is surrounded by an urban growth boundary that limits the supply of developable land. Others observe that the situation was much more complex, pointing to the loose monetary policy pursued by Alan Greenspan, including adjustments to the CPI that measured homeowners equivalent rent instead of actual home price, a recovering economy in the region, and numerous other factors.

Measure 5 shifted the source of school funding to the state. Instead of property taxes, funding had to come from the General Fund. Oregon does not have a sales tax, so money had to be drawn from the General Fund - primarily via the state income tax).

Measure 5 also equalized school funding throughout the state, which meant that schools in rural areas benefited while schools in Portland saw budgets reduced.

== Measure 47 ==
Measure 47, which attempted to cap the annual rate at which property taxes could rise. This was partly to moderate fast growing house prices in Portland. Measure 47 also instituted Oregon&#x27;s double majority rule, in which local tax levies could only pass in minor elections when voter turnout surpassed half of the registered voters. In November 1996, Measure 47 was passed by the Oregon voters 52.3% to 47.7%. Problems with the legal wording of Measure 47 caused the Oregon Legislature to send Measure 50 to voters in 1997, which clarified Measure 47. During a special election in May 1997, Measure 50 was approved by the voters 55.7% to 44.3%.

== Later legislation ==

The tax revolt manifested itself in a series of budget battles in the Oregon Legislature about school funding, the Oregon Health Plan, and other spending priorities during the late 1990s. Then Governor John Kitzhaber and the Republican leadership in the legislature clashed repeatedly over budget priorities.

In 2000, Don McIntire helped place Measure 8 on Oregon&#x27;s ballot, which would have limited state spending to 15 percent of personal income for the previous biennium. Measure 8 was defeated by a margin of 43.5% to 56.5%. However, in the same election Oregonians enshrined the so-called &quot;kicker&quot;—a rebate to taxpayers when state tax revenues were 2% over forecasts—into the state constitution with Measure 86 which passed 62% to 38%. Oregon is the only state with a”kicker.” Originally sent to taxpayers as a check, it is now returned as a credit toward state income tax returns. In 2024, the “kicker” will be a record $5.6 billion.

Anti-tax activists defeated two proposals in 2003 and 2004 (Measure 28 and Measure 30), which were referred to voters by the Oregon State Legislature to increase income taxes temporarily.

Sizemore&#x27;s group ran into legal problems in 2002. Sizemore sparked the ire of several public employees unions with a series of initiatives aimed at reducing public employee pensions and reducing their political power. The unions responded with the Voter Education Project, which tracked signature gatherers hired by Sizemore to place measures on the ballot. After documenting instances of fraud by signature gatherers, the Oregon Education Association, a teachers&#x27; union, successfully sued Sizemore&#x27;s organization under racketeering laws in 2003. The $2.3 million judgment against Oregon Taxpayer&#x27;s United severely hurt Sizemore&#x27;s ability to put measures on the ballot. The fraud allegations also led to the passage of Measure 26 in 2002, which prohibits the payment of signature gatherers on a per-signature basis, and was approved by voters 75% to 25%.

Tax activists generally claim that Oregon&#x27;s government is wasteful and inefficient, arguing that the government could do better with less. They often highlight programs that they feel are unnecessary. Opponents of the tax revolt argue that passing tax decreases via ballot measure leads to short-sighted policy making, in which voters are enticed to vote with the revolt by lower tax bills and without thinking about the budget problems caused by reduced revenues.

She was laid down as Bucareli Bay (ACV-61) under Maritime Commission contract by Kaiser Company, Inc., Vancouver, Washington on 15 January 1943; renamed Manila Bay on 3 April 1943; launched on 10 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Bockius; reclassified CVE-61 on 15 July 1943; acquired by the Navy on 5 October 1943; and commissioned the same day at Astoria, Oregon, Captain Boynton L. Braun in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
After a shakedown cruise along the west coast, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor on 20 November and returned a load of damaged planes to San Diego on 4 December. After training exercises, with Composite Squadron 7 (VC-7) embarked, she departed Hawaii on 3 January 1944. A week later she embarked Rear Admiral Ralph Davidson and became flagship for Carrier Division 24. Joining Task Force 52 (TF 52), she sortied 22 January for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. Between 31 January-6 February, she launched air and antisubmarine patrols as well as dozens of combat missions. Her planes bombed and strafed enemy positions from Kwajalein Island north to Bigej Island and destroyed ammunition dumps and ground installations. She remained in the Marshalls during the next month and extended her operations late in February first to Eniwetok and then to Majuro.

Departing Majuro on 7 March, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; reached Espiritu Santo on the 12th. Three days later she joined TF 37 for airstrikes and surface bombardments against Kavieng, New Ireland on 19–20 March. During the next month she cruised between the Solomons and the Bismarck Archipelago supporting the protracted offensive to neutralize the Archipelago and the Japanese fortress at Rabaul. Thence, on 19 April she steamed so that her planes could attack enemy positions on New Guinea.

====New Guinea====
American naval and ground forces began a three–pronged invasion along northern New Guinea at Aitape, Hollandia, and Tanahmerah Bay on 22 April. During and after the invasion &quot;Manila Bay&quot; launched protective air patrols and sent fighters and bombers to attack and destroy Japanese installations in the Aitape area. On 4 May she returned to Manus Island where Rear Admiral Felix Stump relieved Admiral Davidson as Commander, Carrier Division 24. Admiral Stump transferred his flag to on 6 May, and the following day &quot;Manila Bay&quot; sailed for overhaul at Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 18 May.

After loading 37 Army Republic P-47 Thunderbolts of the Army Air Forces&#x27; 73rd Fighter Squadron, 318th Fighter Group, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; sailed on 5 June for the Mariana Islands. Steaming via Eniwetok, she reached the eastern approaches to Saipan on 19 June. During the next 4 days, she remained east of the embattled island as ships and planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force repulsed the Japanese Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and inflicted staggering losses on the enemy, crippling the Imperial Navy’s air strength permanently.

On 23 June, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; came under enemy air attack during refueling operations east of Saipan. Four Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers attacked her from dead ahead, dropping their bombs which exploded wide to port. As a precautionary and rather unusual move which Raymond A. Spruance later characterized as &quot;commendable initiative&quot;, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; launched four of the P-47 Thunderbolts she was ferrying to fly protective CAP until radar screens were clear of contacts. The Army fighters then flew to Saipan, their intended destination. &quot;Manila Bay&quot; launched the remaining planes the next day and returned to Eniwetok, arriving on 27 June. After embarking 207 wounded troops, she departed on 1 July, touched Pearl Harbor on the 8th, and reached San Diego on 16 July.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; returned to Pearl on 31 August. Two days later, Captain Fitzhugh Lee III took command of the veteran carrier, and after embarking VC-80, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; departed on 15 September as a unit of Carrier Division 24 (CarDiv 24). Steaming via Eniwetok, she reached Manus 3 October and began final preparations for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte Gulf.

====Leyte Gulf====
Assigned to the Task Group 77.4 (TG 77.4), &quot;Manila Bay&quot; departed on 12 October for waters east of the Philippines. Prior to the invasion, her planes pounded enemy ground targets on Leyte, Samar, and Cebu Islands. She launched ground support, spotting, and air cover strikes during the amphibious assaults on 20 October, and she sent bombers and fighters to support ground forces during the critical first few days at Leyte.

As &quot;Manila Bay&quot; cruised to the east of Leyte Gulf with other carriers of Admiral Stump&#x27;s &quot;Taffy 2&quot; (Task Unit 77.4.2, TU 77.4.2), powerful Japanese naval forces converged upon the Philippines and launched a three-pronged offensive to drive the Americans from Leyte. In a series of masterful and coordinated surface attacks, an American battleship, cruiser, and destroyer force met and destroyed enemy ships in the Battle of Surigao Strait early on 25 October. Surviving Japanese ships retreated into the Mindanao Sea pursued by destroyers, PT boats, and after sunrise by carrier-based bombers and fighters.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; sent an eight-plane strike against ground targets on Leyte before sunrise; subsequently, these planes bombed and strafed retiring enemy ships southwest of Panaon Island. A second strike about midmorning pounded the cruiser . In the meantime, however, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; turned her planes against a more immediate threat: the enemy attack against ships of Taffy 3.

=====Samar=====

A running battle ensued between the escort carriers of Rear Adm. Clifton Sprague&#x27;s Taffy 3 and the larger, vastly more powerful surface ships of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force. The self-sacrificing attacks by American destroyers and destroyer escorts, and the prompt, aggressive, and unceasing torpedo, bomb, and strafing strikes by planes from Taffy 2 and Taffy 3 contributed to the American victory against great odds in the Battle off Samar.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; launched two airstrikes during the enemy pursuit of Taffy 3 and two more as the Japanese retreated. At 08:30, she sent four torpedo-laden Grumman TBM Avengers and a seven-plane escort to join the desperate fight. Three launched torpedoes at a battleship, probably , but they missed. The fourth plane launched her torpedo at a heavy cruiser, most likely . It hit the ship to starboard near the fantail, forcing her out of control. The second strike an hour later by two Avengers resulted in one torpedo hit on the portside amidships against an unidentified battleship.

As the Japanese ships broke off attack and circled off Samar, the airstrikes continued. At 11:20, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; launched four Avengers, carrying 500 pound bombs, and four bombers from other carriers. Escorted by General Motors FM-2 Wildcats and led by Commander R. L. Fowler, they soon joined planes from other Taffy carriers. Shortly after 12:30, some 70 planes surprised and attacked the retiring Center Force, strafing and bombing through intense antiaircraft fire. &quot;Manila Bay&quot;″s bombers made a hit and two near misses on the lead battleship, probably or . &quot;Manila Bay&quot; launched her final strike at 12:45, strafing destroyers and getting two hits on a cruiser.

Later that afternoon, &quot;Manila Bay&quot;″s CAP intercepted a Japanese bomber-fighter strike about 50 miles north of Taffy 2. Her four fighters broke up the enemy formation, and with reinforcements drove off the attackers before they reached the carriers. Her planes continued to attack enemy ships the following day. Laden with rockets and bombs, one of her Avengers scored two hits on the cruiser and several rocket hits on the destroyer . Both ships sank about noon in the Visayan Sea after numerous air attacks.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; resumed air operations in support of Leyte ground forces on 27 October. During ground support and air cover missions, her planes shot down an Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; on 27 October and bagged two Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscars&quot; on 29 October. Late on 30 October she sailed for the Admiralty Islands, arriving at Manus on 4 November.

====Mindoro====
After steaming to Kossol Passage late in November, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; departed on 10 December to provide air cover for the Mindoro invasion convoys. The task force entered Mindanao Sea early on 13 December. Late that afternoon in the Sulu Sea south of Negros, they encountered enemy aircraft. The fighter cover shot down or repulsed most of the attackers. Accurate fire from &quot;Manila Bay&quot; shot down one &quot;kamikaze&quot;. A second &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit the destroyer .

During and after the Mindoro landings on 15 December, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; sent her planes on ground support and air cover missions. As troops poured ashore, more &quot;kamikazes&quot; attempted to break the air cover and crash into ships of the covering and carrier group. The few that escaped the combat air patrols were either shot down or driven off by accurate antiaircraft fire. &quot;Manila Bay&quot; helped down three of the raiders and her fighters knocked out two more. After recovering her planes on 16 December, she sailed in convoy via Surigao Strait and reached Kossol on 19 December.

After a trip to Manus, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; sortied New Year&#x27;s Day 1945 with ships of the Luzon Attack Force. With five other escort carriers she provided air cover for Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf&#x27;s Bombardment and Fire Support Group, and direct air support for Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey&#x27;s San Fabian Attack Force.

The task groups steamed via Surigao Strait and the Mindanao Sea into the Sulu Sea where they turned north for the Mindoro Strait. Enemy nuisance and suicide raids began in earnest on 4 January; and despite the tight air cover provided by CVE aircraft, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; crashed into the flight deck of causing her to sink.

====Lingayen Gulf====
The enemy air attacks intensified on 5 January. Patrolling fighters broke up morning and early afternoon strikes, shooting down numerous raiders. At 16:50, a third attack sent all hands to general quarters. Vectored CAP shot down several enemy planes and anti-aircraft fire accounted for others. Three planes got through to the cruisers , the destroyer , and the Australian cruiser .

=====Kamikaze strike=====
Just before 17:50, two &quot;kamikazes&quot; dove at &quot;Manila Bay&quot; from the portside. The first plane hit the flight deck to starboard abaft the bridge, causing fires on the flight and hangar decks, destroying radar transmitting spaces, and wiping out all communications. The second plane, aimed for the bridge, missed the island close aboard to starboard and hit the sea off the fantail.

Firefighting parties promptly brought the blazes under control, including those of two fueled and burning torpedo planes in the hangar deck. Within 24 hours, she resumed limited air operations. Most repairs to her damaged electrical and communication circuits were completed by 9 January, when the amphibious invasion in Lingayen Gulf got underway.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; had 14 men killed and 52 wounded, but by 10 January she resumed full duty in support of the Lingayen Gulf operations. In addition to providing air cover for the task force, her planes flew 104 sorties against targets in western Luzon. They gave effective close support for ground troops at Lingayen and San Fabian and bombed, rocketed, and strafed gun emplacements, buildings, truck convoys, and troop concentrations from Lingayen to Baguio.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; departed in convoy late on 17 January. Steaming via Leyte, Ulithi, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived San Diego on 15 February. Battle damage repairs completed late in April, with VC-72 embarked she trained in Hawaiian waters until sailing for the western Pacific on 24 May. She closed the coast of Okinawa on 13 June and during the next week launched rocket and strafing strikes in the Ryukyu Islands. She departed for the Marianas on 20 June and operated out of Guam and Eniwetok during the closing weeks of the war.

&quot;Manila Bay&quot; steamed to the Aleutians in mid-August. As a unit of TF 44, she departed Adak Island on 31 August to support occupation operations in northern Japan. From 7–12 September her planes carried out photographic and reconnaissance missions over northern Honshū and southern Hokkaidō and dropped emergency supplies at POW camps. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 September, unloaded her aircraft, and steamed to the Marshall Islands carrying replacement troops.

===Post-war===
Assigned to &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty, &quot;Manila Bay&quot; embarked 1,031 veterans at Eniwetok, and from 6–18 October sailed to San Francisco. In November, the carrier aided the disabled Boeing 314 &quot;Honolulu Clipper&quot; 650 miles east of Oahu. After completing 2 more &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; runs, she departed Pearl Harbor on 27 January 1946 and reached Norfolk, Va. on 18 February.

She steamed to Boston from 15–17 April, decommissioned there on 31 July 1946, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CVU-61 on 12 June 1955; her name was struck from the Navy list on 27 May 1958; and she was sold for scrap to Hugo Neu Corp., 2 September 1959.

==Awards==
&quot;Manila Bay&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Mission Bay&quot; (CVE-59) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after Mission Bay, located northwest of San Diego. Launched in May 1943, and commissioned in September, she served as a transport carrier, ferrying aircraft to bases in Europe, Africa, and Asia. She also participated in the Battle of the Atlantic, protecting convoys and conducting antisubmarine patrols. Notably, she escorted President Roosevelt on-board the cruiser as he returned from the Yalta Conference. She was decommissioned in February 1947, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in April 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Mission Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20–mm cannons, and the amount of 40–mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 28 December 1942, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1096, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 26 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. James McDonald; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 13 September 1943, with Captain William Lehigh Rees in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Mission Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She departed San Diego on 15 November bound for the East Coast. Passing through the Panama Canal, arriving at Portsmouth, Virginia on 5 December. There, she was assigned to participate in the Battle of the Atlantic, escorting convoys and hunting German U-boats. She left the East Coast on 26 December, escorting convoys on their way to Casablanca, French Morocco. She arrived on 19 January 1944. She then sailed back, returning to Portsmouth on 8 February.

Her next cruise started on 20 February, when she departed New York City, transporting Army planes and crew, bound for India. Along the way, she made stops at Recife, Brazil, and Cape Town, Union of South Africa. She arrived at Karachi on 29 March, where she unloaded her cargo. She then proceeded back to her home port, arriving back at Portsmouth by 12 May. On 28 May, she departed New York again, ferrying aircraft along with and , round trip to Casablanca. She arrived on 6 June, departed on 8 June, and arrived back at New York on 17 June. As she entered New York Harbor, she collided with a dredge, which resulted in significant damage to the hull. She arrived at Portsmouth on 22 June, where repairs were conducted throughout the month of July. During this time period, Commander William Ellis Gentner, Jr. took over command of the ship. On 12 July, Captain John Roger Ruhsenberger took command of the ship.
On 8 September, she departed, bound for the South Atlantic. After refueling at Dakar, French West Africa on 20 September, she began antisubmarine operations, which lasted throughout the month of November. She arrived back at Portsmouth on 25 November. On 21 December, she left harbor, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she conducted exercises in the strait between Florida and Cuba. These exercises and miscellaneous tasks took her until February 1945. She was then ordered to sail to Gibraltar, where she would meet the heavy cruiser which was carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his entourage back from the Yalta Conference. She rendezvoused with the cruiser on 23 February, and escorted the ship as it passed through the open Atlantic. She then left the convoy, mooring at Bermuda on 27 February, before returning to Portsmouth on 9 March.

She departed again on 29 March, and conducted a final antisubmarine sweep of the North Atlantic. Having found no contacts, she anchored off of New York on 14 May. She then cruised off the East Coast, training pilots and conducting pilot qualifications, before she proceeded to Guantanamo Bay on 19 July. She arrived at Quonset Point on 2 August, where she continued training pilots until December, well after the Japanese surrender. On 19 December, she was assigned to the 16th Reserve Fleet, based at Norfolk, Virginia. She was fully decommissioned on 21 February 1947, and mothballed as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, albeit she still stayed with the 16th Reserve Fleet. On 30 November 1949, she was moved up to the Bayonne Naval Supply Depot, New Jersey, where she lay until she was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1958. She was sold to Hugo Neu Corp on 30 April 1959, and towed to Japan, where she was broken up, starting January 1960.

<doc id="554027" wikidata="Q930940" url="?curid=554027" title="USS Ommaney Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; (CVE–79) was a of the United States Navy, which served during World War II. It was named after Ommaney Bay, located at the south end of Baranof Island, Alaska. Launched in late 1943 and commissioned in early 1944, the ship took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign followed by several battles during the Philippines campaign in 1944 and early 1945. She was heavily damaged in a kamikaze attack and subsequently scuttled on 4 January 1945, with the loss of 95 men, including two men on board the destroyer escort who were killed by flying debris. She earned 2 battle stars whilst in service. In 2023, the Navy History and Heritage command announced that the wreck was located by &quot;a combination of underwater survey and video information provided by Sea Scan Survey and DPT Scuba, two Australian diving firms, to positively identify the wreck.&quot;

==Design and description==
&quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided a force of , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft.

One /38-caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm (1.57 in) anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Battle off Samar, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 27 aircraft. During the Battle of Mindoro, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft. Whilst she was in transit in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, and during her eventual sinking, she carried 19 FM-2 fighters, 10 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, a TBM-3 variant torpedo bomber, and a TBM-1CP spotter plane, for a total of 31 aircraft.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 6 October 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1116, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 29 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. P. K. Robottom; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 11 February 1944, Commodore Howard L. Young in command.

== Service history ==
After commissioning and fitting out at Astoria, Oregon, and conducting shakedown in Puget Sound, &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; sailed on 19 March 1944 from Oakland, California, bound for Brisbane, Australia, with passengers and a cargo of supplies and aircraft. By 27 April, she had completed her mission and was back in San Diego, where she began a rigorous ten days of carrier qualification landings, drills and tests. Then, after minor alterations and repairs, the ship sailed on 10 June for Pearl Harbor. Until 12 August she trained air groups and squadrons, then she sailed to Tulagi to rehearse for the invasion of the Palau Islands. From 11 September until the beginning of October, &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; sat off Peleliu and Angaur and provided air cover for the fleet and close support strikes for the forces ashore. On 18 September 1944, a TBM-1C from &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;, low on fuel, was the first aircraft to land onto Peleliu&#x27;s airfield.

&quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; sailed to Manus Island to renew her depleted stock of fuel and ammunition, then joined Rear Admiral Felix Stump&#x27;s &quot;Taffy 2&quot; (TU 77.4.2) for the invasion of Leyte, arriving on 22 October. At the beginning of the Battle off Samar, the escort carriers began launching airstrikes in an effort to cripple as many of the approaching enemy force as possible. On 25 October, at 01:55, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid ordered three searches at daybreak. &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; was directed at 05:09 to cover the sector between 340° and 30°. Because of delays, it took two hours for a search contingent of five fighters and seven torpedo bombers to be launched. If launched earlier, the patrol could&#x27;ve possibly intercepted Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s task force, and provided advance warning for Taffy 3, influencing the subsequent Battle off Samar.
The search contingent, becoming aware of the confrontation, moved to aid Taffy 3. Some sources credit her airgroup&#x27;s bombing with seriously damaging the heavy cruiser &quot;Chokai&quot; during this phase of the battle. Cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;s action report confirms that it was aerial bombing which crippled her squadron-mate.

At around 08:20, five Wildcats and six Avengers from &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; attacked the cruiser , part of the Japanese force which attacked from the direction of Surigao Strait to the south-west of the landing area, inflicting some damage. 40 minutes later, her Avengers joined 17 other torpedo bombers in crippling &quot;Mogami&quot;. She sank three hours later, scuttled by . &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; launched some six strikes that day, and along with the rest of Task Group 77.4.1, she turned potential defeat into victory. As part of Taffy 2, she was also obliged to accept aircraft from other task groups, which were damaged or low on fuel from their strikes. She was forced to jettison several aircraft over her deck to preserve the functionality of her flight deck. On 30 October, her task group retired from Leyte Gulf, bound for Manus.
The carrier spent the month of November at Manus and Kossol Passage for availability and replenishment. On 10 November, she was docked in Seeadler Harbor, approximately from the ammunition ship , when the ship suddenly exploded violently. Even from her distant vantage point, &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; was showered with metal fragments, and was hit by a tidal wave. From 12 December to 17 December, the escort carrier operated in the Mindanao and Sulu Seas in support of operations on the island of Mindoro.

On the early morning of 15 December, forty Japanese planes, divided equally between kamikazes and escorts, took off from Clark Field and Davao, bound for the battleships and carriers to the east of Mindoro. The first sightings were reported at 7:00, and for the rest of the morning, kamikaze attacks harried the task force. At 09:40, a group of Japanese planes dove towards the carriers. One plane missed with a bomb, and disengaged, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from and the destroyer escorts. However, a Yokosuka P1Y kamikaze dove directly towards &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;, approaching from the port-bow side. Engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire from the entire task force, the plane was set ablaze about away, and passed over the flight deck, crashing into the ocean. On 19 December she returned to Kossol Passage. On 27 December, she departed for the Philippines in support of the planned 6th Army landings at Lingayen Gulf. After arriving, she paused at San Pedro Bay, before leaving port and entering the Sulu Sea on 3 January 1945.

==Sinking==

On the afternoon of 4 January 1945, she was transiting the Sulu Sea, to the west of the Philippines. At 17:00, approximately 15 Japanese planes were picked up on radar, west of the task group, and approaching quickly. These planes split into two groups, one group heading towards the rear of the task group, whilst the other continued on its course towards the center. Although fighters from the carrier group were scrambled, false radar signals hampered their efforts to intercept, and the only successful interception was when P-47 fighters intercepted two enemy planes, shooting down one. The other plane escaped, and is believed to be the kamikaze which would attack &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;. This successful intercept was not reported back to command, nor was the fact that the plane which escaped was being herded towards the carrier group. At 17:12, a Yokosuka P1Y penetrated the screen undetected and made for &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;, approaching directly towards the ship&#x27;s bow. Captain Young later reported that the kamikaze&#x27;s approach was concealed by the blinding glare of the sun.

Captain Young, acutely aware of the kamikaze threat, had assigned multiple lookouts throughout the carrier&#x27;s deck. At the time of the attack, ten lookouts were assigned, along with an additional lookout located on the signal platform, equipped with Polaroid glasses. Additionally, a lack of radar signals had led the task group to believe that the Japanese planes had withdrawn, and the kamikaze attack took the lookouts by complete surprise. was only able to respond with inaccurate anti-aircraft fire, whilst &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; was unable to react at all. The plane sliced across the superstructure with its wing, collapsing it onto the flight deck. It then veered into her flight deck on the forward starboard side. Two bombs were released; one of them penetrated the flight deck and detonated below, setting off a series of explosions among the fully gassed planes on the forward third of the hangar deck, near the No. 1 boiler uptakes. The second bomb passed through the hangar deck, ruptured the fire main on the second deck, and exploded near the starboard side. A TBM torpedo bomber had been hit by the kamikaze&#x27;s wreckage, sparking a fire which consumed the aft of the flight deck. Water pressure forward was lost immediately, along with power and bridge communications. An oil tank may have been breached, contributing to the fire, as the smoke was noted as looking &quot;oily&quot;.

Men struggling with the terrific blazes on the hangar deck soon had to abandon it because of the heavy black smoke from the burning planes and exploding .50 caliber ammunition. Destroyer escorts found it difficult to assist &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;, because of the intense heat, the ammunition going off, and the real possibility that a catastrophic detonation could be triggered by the blaze. The destroyer , attempting to maneuver into a position to fight the fires, collided with the carrier, damaging her port bridge wing. At 17:45, wounded crew began to be taken off the ship, and by 17:50 the entire topside area had become untenable. In addition, the stored torpedo warheads threatened to detonate at any time. The order to abandon ship was given. At 18:12, Captain Young was the last man to evacuate the burning wreck. At 18:18, the torpedoes stored in the aft end of the ship finally detonated, collapsing the flight deck and launching debris onto the destroyers who were rescuing survivors. Two crewmen from the aboard a motor whaleboat were struck and killed by airborne debris.

At 19:58 the carrier was scuttled by a torpedo from the destroyer , under orders from Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. A total of 95 Navy men were lost, and 65 men were wounded, including the two killed from &quot;Eichenberger&quot;. On 6 January and on 9 January, was struck by kamikaze attacks, killing seven survivors rescued from &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;. As a replacement for the sunken carrier, was dispatched to support the landing on Lingayen Gulf.

==Discovery of wreck==

On July 10, 2023, the Naval History and Heritage Command at the Washington Navy Yard announced that two Australian diving firms had located the wreck in the Sulu Sea. Retired Rear Admiral Samuel J. Cox said that &quot;wreckage had been spotted at the site and preliminarily examined several years ago...There’s no other escort carrier anywhere near there, so we were pretty sure that that’s what it was and where it was... Then this latest group was able to get down there and find enough features so that there’s absolutely no doubt.”

<doc id="554029" wikidata="Q7872837" url="?curid=554029" title="USS Petrof Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; (CVE-80) was the twenty-sixth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Petrof Bay, which in turn was named in 1928 after Ivan Petroff, a Russian Alaskan who served as a special census agent for the 1880 United States census. The bay is located within Kuiu Island, which at the time was a part of the Territory of Alaska. The ship was launched in January 1944, commissioned in February, and served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Philippines campaign, including the Battle off Samar, the Battle of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. She was decommissioned in July 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. Ultimately, she was broken up in September 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and was designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 16 FM-2 Wildcat fighters and 10 TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bombers for a total of 26 aircraft. However, during the Battle of Leyte, at the opening stages of the Philippines campaign, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, at the middle stages of the Philippines campaign, as well as during the Battle of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers for a total of 30 aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 15 October 1943 under the name &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1117, the twenty-sixth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-80, indicating that she was the eightieth escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. She was launched on 5 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J.G. Atkins, the wife of Captain Atkins, the executive officer of the Farragut Naval Training Station, located in Northern Idaho; transferred to the Navy and commissioned on 18 February 1944, with Captain Joseph Lester Kane in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast, heading to Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. Upon arriving, she took on passengers, aircraft, and cargo, before departing on 29 March for the southwest Pacific. She arrived at Espiritu Santo of the New Hebrides on 14 April, where she unloaded part of her cargo. On 20 April, she steamed for Seeadler Harbor, in Manus Island of the Admiralty Islands, arriving there on 25 April. After arriving, she transferred eight aircraft that she was ferrying to other ships within the harbor.

On the morning of 29 April, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; met with the Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Force 58) of the Fifth Fleet, whereupon she began providing replacement aircraft to the task force in preparation for a follow-up strike against the Japanese naval stronghold of Truk of the Caroline Islands, which had previously been heavily damaged in Operation Hailstone. She then headed to Majuro Atoll of the Marshall Islands, arriving on 3 May, where she replenished. She then rendezvoused with the Fast Carrier Task Force again, after it had successfully conducted its strike, providing all of her aircraft, as well as most of her aviation spares and material to the fleet carriers. She also loaded onboard damaged or obsolete aircraft, as well as salvage equipment for transportation back to the West Coast.

Accompanied by the and three screening destroyers, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; headed back to the West Coast on 7 May, sailing into the San Francisco Bay on 20 May. She then headed back down to San Diego, where she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 76, commanded by Lieutenant Commander James W. McCauley, and which was to be assigned to become her combat air contingent. She initially conducted shakedown air operations with her newly embarked squadron, before heading westwards for Pearl Harbor on 30 July, arriving there on 6 August.

===Marianas and Palau Islands campaign===

At Pearl Harbor, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; disembarked her excess aircraft, and on 12 August, she left port, as a part of Task Group 32, the Western Attack Group, assigned to the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, but more specifically, to the planned Battle of Peleliu, codenamed Operation Stalemate II. She first headed to Guadalcanal of the Solomon Islands, anchoring in Tulagi Harbor on the afternoon of 24 August. On 4 September, having been assigned to Task Unit 32.7.2, or &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, commanded by Rear Admiral George R. Henderson along with her sisters , which was Henderson&#x27;s flagship, and , she sortied for the western Caroline Islands as a part of the Peleliu and Anguar Movement Group Number 2, screened by the s , , , and the .

&quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, upon arriving off of Peleliu on 15 September, immediately began launching strikes against Japanese positions on the island. Marines of the 1st Marine Division landed on the southwest beaches of the island on the morning of 15 September, with the aircraft of VC-76 providing crucial close air support as they advanced up the island. For example, on the late afternoon of 15 September, as the Japanese garrison massed for a counterattack, a VC-76 TBM dropped a bomb in the midst of three tanks, putting all three out of action. Her aircraft continued supporting the Marines almost continuously until 29 September, with the exception of one day when she replenished on munitions at Kossol Roads. Notably, her aircraft were allowed almost free rein over the island, with the beleaguered Japanese forces in the area never providing any air opposition. By 30 September, the airfield on the island had become operational, enabling the use of land-based aircraft, and therefore &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; retired back to Manus Island.

===Philippines campaign===
Whilst at Manus Island, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.1, or &quot;Taffy 1&quot; of Task Group 77.4, the Escort Carrier Group. Commanded by Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague, it consisted of the s , which was Sprague&#x27;s flagship, , , , as well as the &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; and &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; in Carrier Division 28, subdivided from the other carriers, but still within the same task unit. Carrier Division 28 was commanded by Rear Admiral George R. Henderson, whose flag was still hoisted onboard &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot;. On 14 October, she sortied from Seeadler Harbor, headed for Leyte Gulf in support of the opening landings on Leyte, which was to be the return of American forces to the Philippines, and which would also begin the Philippines campaign.

As the escort carriers snaked northwards from the Admiralty Islands, they provided air cover and screening for the troop transports underway. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; and &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; were assigned to escort the transports of Task Group 79.3, which was carrying the troops of the 7th Infantry Division, which was bound to land near Dulag, near the southern flank of the planned initial beachhead. On 20 October, having finished her task of escorting the attack transports, she separated from the rest of &quot;Taffy 1&quot; and rendezvoused with Task Unit 77.4.2, or &quot;Taffy 2&quot; for the initial landings, as &quot;Taffy 2&quot; was responsible for covering the landing of the 7th Infantry Division. Between the two carriers, they made forty air sorties on 20 October, as the 7th Infantry landed on Leyte. She then detached from &quot;Taffy 2&quot; and rejoined &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, which had been suffering from Japanese air attacks. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; continued providing air support from 21 October to 24 October.

In the meantime, as the escort carriers conducted their strikes, the Japanese garrison on Suluan had managed to alert their command, triggering Admiral Soemu Toyoda to launch Shō-Gō 1, a gambit to defend Japan&#x27;s access to the oil fields of Southeast Asia. On 24 October, news began filtering through of the Japanese fleet moving out to engage, in what was to be the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, having rejoined &quot;Taffy 1&quot; (&quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; had transferred her aircraft contingent to other carriers and retired from the field on 24 October), was located in the southernmost group of the escort carriers, just east of Surigao City. With this news, VC-76 began rearming into a complement more suitable to fighting against surface ships, with Captain Kane ordering all of her TBM Avengers to be loaded with torpedoes, of which they would dearly need the following day.

Over the night of 25 October, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force swung through the San Bernardino Strait, confronting and catching &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, the northernmost escort carrier group, by surprise as the sun rose. The Center Force had previously been sighted and attacked by aircraft in the Sibuyan Sea, and had been thought to be withdrawing, information which had certainly played into Admiral William Halsey Jr.&#x27;s decision to lead his Third Fleet northwards, after spotting Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s diversionary Northern Force. Thus, the only ships covering the vulnerable landing crafts of Leyte Gulf were the three escort carrier task groups and their screens.

At 06:47, on the morning of 25 October, &quot;Taffy 3&quot; radioed for help, reporting that they were being attacked by a large Japanese surface force. Therefore, &quot;Taffy 1&quot; and &quot;Taffy 2&quot; launched aircraft in relief. As a part of this action, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; launched two special strikes against the Center Force, with the first special strike consisting of eight FM-2 Wildcats, which linked with aircraft from &quot;Santee&quot; and &quot;Sangamon&quot; to strafe the Japanese fleet. The Wildcats made strafing runs against the Japanese ships, to little effect, and released their bombs, to unknown effect (heavy anti-aircraft fire made immediate observation extremely precarious). Two of her Wildcats were lost in this action, one of them to friendly anti-aircraft fire as it tried to return to &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; over Tacloban, and another to the flak of the Japanese fleet as it made a run.

In the meantime, the second special strike of &quot;Taffy 1&quot; organized, consisting of forty-one planes, coming into formation at around 07:25. Amongst this contingent were four FM-2 Wildcats and six TBM-1C Avengers launched by &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;. Immediately after these planes had been launched, at 07:29, radar detected six Japanese Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zeros&quot; approaching &quot;Taffy 1&quot;. As a result, the crew of &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; were immediately called to general quarters, and would remain so for the next 108 hours. These six planes carried out the first organized kamikaze attacks to take place in the course of the Pacific War. At 07:40, visual contact was made with four of the Zeroes, which were proceeding some above the carriers. Three of the kamikazes immediately began their dives, with the fourth loitering around before selecting a target. The first kamikaze struck &quot;Santee&quot;, and the second kamikaze was shot down just short of &quot;Sangamon&quot;, spraying shrapnel all over the carrier. The third kamikaze dove towards &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, but was shot down by her anti-aircraft guns as it made its dive. Nonetheless, it crashed into the ocean near enough to send water splashing onto her flight deck. The fourth kamikaze, having chosen its target, dove and struck &quot;Suwanee&quot;. A few minutes later, &quot;Santee&quot; was hit by a torpedo fired from the .

In the chaos following the immediate aftermath of the kamikaze attacks, a Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber dove out of the cloud cover to the port side of &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, catching the carrier&#x27;s crew by surprise. The aircraft strafed the carrier as it dove, and released its bomb unmolested by anti-aircraft fire, which still missed to the carrier&#x27;s starboard. Thereafter, it disengaged and flew off.

At 09:10, having been delayed considerably by kamikazes attempting to harry &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, the special strike group proceeded northwards, reaching the vicinity of the battle at around 10:00. By then, Kurita had been discouraged by the American resistance, and was withdrawing eastwards. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;″s Avengers made torpedo runs against the battleships , , and , with two Avengers even attempting to strike the largest battleship ever launched, the super battleship . The crew of VC-76 reported one probable hit on &quot;Yamato&quot;, two probable hits on &quot;Nagato&quot;, two hits on &quot;Kongō&quot;, as well as one hit on an unidentified cruiser. However, the veracity of these claims are certainly dubitable, considering that the Japanese never recorded said torpedo &quot;hits&quot;.

In the meantime, her Wildcats strafed the Japanese fleet, with apparent greater success than during the first special strike. Remarkably, despite the limited damage inflicted by the second special strike, none of her aircraft were lost to enemy fire. However, as they proceeded back from their strikes, the returning aircraft were dangerously low on fuel. Some of her Wildcats diverted to Tacloban, where they were harried by friendly anti-aircraft fire. In addition, some of her Avengers diverted to of &quot;Taffy 3&quot; and of &quot;Taffy 2&quot;, with one of her Avengers landing with less than of fuel remaining. Four of her aircraft opted to try to return to &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, the two Avengers that had made their run against &quot;Yamato&quot;, as well as two Wildcats. Three of those aircraft landed on her flight deck successfully, with one of the Avengers being forced to ditch into the ocean within sight of the carrier.

At 15:30, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; launched a final strike to harass the retreating Center Force. After rendezvousing with the other aircraft of &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, the aircraft proceed to the San Bernardino Strait, where it encountered the , whereupon her Avengers made torpedo runs against the cruiser. The apparently overeager pilots recorded two torpedo hits and one probable torpedo hit, when in reality the cruiser suffered only minor damage. Her final strike was forced to also divert to Tacloban, as their fuel was insufficient to return to &quot;Taffy 1&quot;. Thus, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was left with only two Avengers onboard.

At 22:37, &quot;Taffy 1&quot; was steaming towards a rendezvous with &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, when one of its escorts, the , sighted the feathery wake of a submarine&#x27;s periscope perpendicular to the escort carriers. As &quot;Coolbaugh&quot; charged in towards the wake to deliver depth charges, with inconclusive results, the rest of the fleet conducted an immediate 90-degree emergency turn. As the turn was completed, the crew of &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; spotted two torpedo wakes straddling the carrier, one to the portside, and another apparently coasting under the overhang on the starboard side.

Whilst the American forces had been distracted with the Battle off Samar and its immediate aftermath, Vice Admiral Naomasa Sakonju&#x27;s transport unit, which consisted of the light cruiser , the , as well as four transports, which were in the process of unloading 2,000 troops onto Ormoc Bay, on the Western coast of Leyte. The transport unit had also previously included the , but after having been damaged by the on 23 October, it withdrew westwards. The transport unit finished unloading its troops on the morning of 26 October, but as it withdrew, it was quickly sighted. Therefore, a strike group of twenty-three Avengers and twenty-nine fighters were assembled to strike the Japanese ships. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; contributed its last two Avengers to the strike group, and the strike group reached the Japanese ships at 10:00 in the morning. One of &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;″s Avengers scored a hit with a semi-armor-piercing bomb on &quot;Kinu&quot;, which sank shortly afterwards. In addition, her fighters strafed &quot;Uranami&quot;, contributing to her sinking.

Whilst the Japanese ships were being harried by the aircraft of &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, two kamikaze strike groups took off from Cebu on the morning of 26 October, the first group consisting of two kamikazes and one escort, and the second group consisting of three kamikazes and two escorts. The first group was quickly intercepted by American fighters and all shot down, but the second group proceeded towards &quot;Taffy 1&quot; undetected, only being picked up by radar when it was away from the fleet. Fighters returning from the attack on the Japanese ships were diverted to intercept the second group, but were distracted by the escorts, enabling the kamikazes to make their runs against the escort carriers. The first kamikaze, apparently intent on diving on &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, was shot down by a fighter, whilst the other two kamikazes began making their dives at 12:38. The second kamikaze dove onto, and struck &quot;Suwanee&quot;, whilst the third kamikaze dove down on &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, but it had its tail shot off by intense flak at an elevation of approximately , and it crashed into the sea just off the stern of &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;.

During the night of 28 October, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; retired to refuel, rendezvousing with Taffy 2. On the afternoon of 30 October, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, along with the rest of &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, retired for Manus Island. Remarkably, despite the loss of several of her aircraft, and the fact that VC-76 had logged 15,000 flight hours over a period of eight months of active combat, the entirety of the crew of VC-76 survived the Philippines campaign. Seventeen Navy Crosses were awarded amongst the aircrew of VC-76, and Captain Kane also received a Navy Cross.

After arriving at Manus, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.5, the Reinforcement Carrier Group, and she was yet again under the flag of Rear Admiral Henderson. During her stay at Manus, Captain Ralph Sperry Clarke took over command of the vessel. She departed Manus Harbor on 19 November, arriving in the traffic lanes leading to Leyte on 23 November, whereupon she began operations providing air cover for convoys proceeding to and departing from the Philippines, a task necessary due to the convoys being harassed with irritating frequency by Japanese aircraft based on Mindanao. She continued these operations until the end of the year, when she was detached from Task Group 77.3, and joined up with Task Force 79, Vice Admiral Theodore Stark Wilkinson&#x27;s Lingayen Attack Force, in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. She provided air cover for the attack transports of the task force as they proceeded to Lingayen Gulf, and gave close air support as they landed. The task force came under intense kamikaze attack as it proceeded up the South China Sea to northern Luzon, sinking her sister &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; on 4 January 1945, and damaging several other carriers. This forced &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; into assuming double duty, taking on some of their assigned tasks.

On 10 January, Task Unit 77.4.6, the Close Covering Carrier Group was formed under the command of Rear Admiral Henderson, comprising &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot;, and . The group was screened by the destroyers and , as well as the destroyer escorts and . On 17 January, the United States Army Air Forces took over responsibility for air operations over Luzon, and &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; joined Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey&#x27;s fleet operating west of northern Mindoro. On 29 and 30 January, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; provided air cover and close air support as the Eighth Army landed at San Narciso and San Antonio, located just to the north of Manila, where they prepared for the Battle of Manila.

===Battle of Iwo Jima===
Upon helping the Eighth Army gain a foothold north of Manila, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; retired for Ulithi of the Caroline Islands. Just five days later, she departed Ulithi, this time assigned to Task Unit 52.2.1, under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, in preparation for the Battle of Iwo Jima. The Air Force wanted the island base neutralized to eliminate the threat of fighter interceptions, and also because they wanted to use the island as a base to provide fighter escorts for the B-29 Superfortress raids on Tokyo and other assorted Japanese cities. She arrived off of Iwo Jima on 15 February, in company with Task Group 52.19, the Advance Movement Group.

Upon arriving, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;″s air contingent commenced operations over the island, which in conjunction with surface bombardment, aimed to soften the Japanese defenses. On 17 February, one of her Avengers was hit by anti-aircraft fire, and was then subsequently forced to ditch next to a friendly destroyer. On 18 February, the troop transports carrying the Marines arrived offshore, and they landed on Iwo Jima the following day. Throughout the battle, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;″s aircraft logged 786 air sorties conducted in support of the operation. Notably, on 21 February, the fleet carrier was hit by a kamikaze, and &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, which was heading to refuel, was recalled back by Vice Admiral Calvin T. Durgin.

By 7 March, the airstrip on Iwo Jima had been captured and restored to be fully operational, enabling ground-based aircraft to provide close air support in lieu of the carriers. On 8 March, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; retired to Ulithi, stopping at Guam in the Marianas Islands along the way. At Guam, Composite Squadron (VC) 76 was disembarked and replaced with Composite Squadron (VC) 93 on 10 March.

===Battle of Okinawa===

At Ulithi, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was assigned to Task Unit 52.1.2, under the command of Rear Admiral Felix Stump, in preparation for the Battle of Okinawa. She departed on 21 March, escorting Task Group 54.1 en route. Upon arriving, on March 26, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; covered the Marines that landed on the Kerama Islands as a preliminary for the main battle. On March 31, she also provided support for the Marines landing on Keise Shima, a small archipelago of islets to the west of Naha. On 1 April, the main landings on Okinawa took place, and aircraft from &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; provided close air support every step of the way.

On 13 April, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was ordered to neutralize Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, from which kamikazes were operating. The first strikes were launched from a distance of away, and her aircraft engaged heavy anti-aircraft fire upon arrival, which shot down two fighters, including VC-93&#x27;s commander, albeit the crew of both aircraft were quickly rescued. By 16 April, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; had resumed her typical operations over Okinawa.

&quot;Petrof Bay&quot; continued air operations, with occasional breaks for refueling, rearming, and resupply until 26 May, when she was relieved of her duty by the arrival of other escort carriers. VC-93 had shot down seventeen enemy aircraft, had a probable kill on another, and destroyed many other planes on the ground, but it had lost four Wildcats due to combat, six Wildcats operationally, and it had also lost four Avengers operationally. To alleviate the pressure on the fighter pilots, six of the Avenger pilots had volunteered to become fighter pilots, with one of these &quot;hybrid&quot; pilots becoming VC-93&#x27;s top scorer, shooting down four aircraft. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; had lost the lives of two pilots and one crewman in the course of the operation.

Upon being relieved, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; headed for Guam, entering Apra Harbor on 30 May. There, Composite Squadron (VC) 93 was disembarked, and Composite Squadron (VC) 90 was taken onboard, albeit for transportation to Pearl Harbor. On 19 June, she arrived at Naval Air Base San Pedro, on Terminal Island, for a general overhaul. She completed her overhaul on 13 August, and sailed for Pearl Harbor. En route, on 15 August, news of the Surrender of Japan reached the crew.

==Post-war==
&quot;Petrof Bay&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 20 August, whereupon she took onboard Composite Squadron (VC) 20 for qualifying exercises off Hawaii. Upon completing said exercises, she unloaded VC-20 and took onboard the crew and aircraft of Composite Squadron (VC) 4, and steamed for Tokyo Bay on 29 August, stopping at Enewetak in the Marshall Islands and Saipan in the Marianas Islands along the way. She conducted flight operations with VC-4 along the way, providing reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols. The last plane to touch down on &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;″s flight deck was a TBM Avenger, which landed at 16:28 on 10 September, whilst the carrier was transiting off Saipan. She arrived at Saipan on 11 September, where a shift in orders meant that she would not have to continue to Tokyo Bay. She headed back to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, carrying onboard 104 personnel of Composite Squadron (VC) 7, as well as other military passengers. She unloaded the entirety of her aircraft contingent at Pearl Harbor upon arriving.

At Pearl Harbor, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; embarked 123 personnel of Patrol Bombing Squadron (VPB) 52 and more military passengers, departing Oahu on 5 October, and sailing into San Francisco on 11 October, where she disembarked her passengers, as well as the crew of VC-4. On 18 October, she made a round trip to Pearl Harbor, ferrying veterans back to the West Coast, returning on 31 October. She then entered Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for alterations to accommodate more passengers, and upon the completion of said alterations, joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific.

&quot;Petrof Bay&quot;″s first &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; run began on 17 November, when she departed for Enewetak, where she loaded 1,062 veterans, followed by another 153 more at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. She returned to San Francisco on 6 December, and she made another run on 12 December, this time to Guam, where she took on 944 veterans. She then proceeded to San Pedro Bay, arriving there on 18 January 1946. She departed San Pedro on 29 January, unloading her passengers at San Diego. She then headed for the East Coast for inactivation work, passing through the Panama Canal, and arriving at Norfolk, Virginia on 15 February. She then proceeded northwards to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving there on 23 February.

Upon arriving, &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; was decommissioned and mothballed on 31 July 1946, joining the Boston group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, mooring at the South Boston Naval Annex. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, receiving the hull symbol CVU-80. She was struck from the Navy list on 27 June 1958, and she was sold for scrapping on 30 July 1959 to J. Berkurt. She was ultimately broken up in Antwerp, Belgium during September 1959. &quot;Petrof Bay&quot; received five battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; (CVE–62) was a of the United States Navy that served in the Pacific War during World War II. The carrier entered service in 1943 and participated in a series of operations in the South Pacific including the Philippines campaign, the Battle off Samar and the Battle of Okinawa. During the Okinawa battle, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; was struck by a Japanese aircraft and heavily damaged, ending the ship&#x27;s participation in the war. Once repaired, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, the return of American soldiers from the Pacific theatre. Following the completion of the operation the escort carrier was decommissioned in 1946 and placed in reserve. In 1959, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; was sold for scrap.

==Construction and career==
She was laid down as &quot;Begum&quot; (MC hull 1099), on 17 January 1943, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Vancouver, Washington, under Maritime Commission contract, named &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; on 22 January 1943, after a bay in the Graham Islands off the southeast coast of Alaska; launched on 20 July 1943; sponsored by Lady Halifax, wife of the United Kingdom&#x27;s ambassador to the United States; and commissioned on 14 October 1943, Captain Harold L. Meadow in command.

===1943–1944===
After her shakedown cruise off the California coast, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; performed aircraft and personnel ferrying duties between San Diego and Hawaii for Commander Fleet Air, West Coast, until 3 January 1944. Then, with squadron VC-63 embarked, she departed San Diego for Pearl Harbor, reporting to ComCarDiv 24, 5th Amphibious Force, on 10 January. On 23 January she sortied with TG 51.2 for the invasion of the Marshalls. Between 31 January and 7 February, as positions on Majuro Atoll were consolidated, CVE–62 furnished anti-submarine and combat air patrols (CAPs) and area searches for the attack force. On 8 February, she extended her operations to Wotje and Maloelap, alternating for the remainder of the month between those islands and Majuro.

Departing Majuro on 7 March, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; reached Espiritu Santo on the 12th. Three days later she joined TF 37 for air strikes and surface bombardments against Kavieng, New Ireland, 19 March20 March. She then cruised to the north of the Solomons and New Ireland, providing air cover for convoys to and from Emirau where an air base and a limited naval base were being established. During the next three weeks, she continued to cruise in the Solomons-Bismarck Archipelago area in support of the protracted offensive to neutralize the latter and seal off the Japanese fortress at Rabaul.

On 19 April she rendezvoused with TF 78 and then steamed toward New Guinea where her planes pounded enemy positions in support of a three pronged attack by Allied land and naval forces against Aitape, Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), and Tanahmerah Bay, 22 April. During and after the landings, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; launched protective air patrols and sent fighters and bombers to destroy Japanese installations in the Aitape area. Returning to Manus for engine repairs, 28 April, she sailed 7 May for Pearl Harbor, arriving 18 May.

After loading 37 P-47D Thunderbolt fighters of the Army Air Forces&#x27; 19th Fighter Squadron, 318th Fighter Group, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 5 June en route to the Marianas. Steaming via Eniwetok, she arrived off Saipan on 19 June and was ordered to retire eastward until the Battle of the Philippine Sea was decided. On the 22nd she steamed westward and commenced catapulting the Army planes toward their destination, Aslito Air Field, Saipan. She dispatched 25 on the 22nd and the remainder early on the 23rd, then retired to a refueling area 45 miles east of Saipan.

There the formation came under enemy air attack. Four Aichi &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers dropped their payloads, but no hits were scored; intensive anti-aircraft fire prevented damage to the main targets, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; and &quot;Manila Bay&quot;. The latter ship, with Army fighters still on board, then catapulted those aircraft to provide protective CAP until the radar screens were clear of contacts.

&quot;Natoma Bay&quot; returned to Eniwetok, 27 June, embarked casualties, and sailed for San Diego, arriving 16 July for availability, logistics and ferry duty. Between 5 September and 14 September she conducted qualification and training exercises for VC-81 (Composite Squadron 81) off Pearl Harbor, and on the 15th, got under way for Manus as a unit of the 3rd Fleet. On 3 October she reached Seeadler Harbor and began final preparations for the invasion of the Philippines.

Assigned to the Escort Carrier Group (TG 77.4), &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; departed the Admiralties, 12 October, for waters east of the Philippines. After weathering stormy seas, 14–17 October, she commenced offensive flight operations on the 18th. Prior to the invasion, her planes bombed Japanese positions and conducted strafing runs against enemy vehicles and small craft on and around Leyte and Negros. During the amphibious assault on the 20th, she launched ground support, spotting, and air cover strikes. Then, during the critical days following the landings, she sent bombers and fighters to support the ground forces.

On 25 October, as &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;, flagship of Rear Admiral Stump, CTU 77.4.2 (&quot;Taffy 2&quot;), cruised off the eastern entrance to Leyte Gulf, the Japanese launched a tri-force offensive to drive the Allies from Leyte, and from the Philippines. During the early morning hours, the enemy&#x27;s Southern Force was soundly defeated in Surigao Strait. Surviving Japanese ships retreated into the Mindanao Sea pursued by destroyers, PT boats, and after sunrise, by carrier based aircraft.

At 06:58, &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, (6 CVEs, 3 DDs, and 4 DEs) cruising off Samar under Rear Admiral C. Sprague, was attacked by the vastly more powerful Japanese Center Force (4 BBs, 6 CAs, 2 CLs, 11 DDs) under Admiral Kurita. At 07:01, having ordered all operational planes launched, Adm. Sprague requested any available assistance. Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force, however, had already accomplished its mission — Admiral Halsey&#x27;s TF 38 had been drawn off to the north. The cruisers and battleships under Admiral Oldendorf were replenishing after their battle in Surigao Strait. Help could only come from the south. At 07:02, &quot;Taffy 2&quot;, 20 miles to the south-south-east, responded and by 07:08 all available planes were en route. Those already dispatched on routine missions were recalled.

In a running battle which ensued, the determination of self-sacrificing destroyers and destroyer escorts of &quot;Taffy 3&quot; and fighters and bombers of the three Taffies resulted in an almost unbelievable, but necessary, victory in the Battle off Samar.

Ordered not to concentrate on any particular ship, but to cripple as many as possible, planes from &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; conducted two strikes against the enemy within an hour and a half. At 09:26 a third strike, with 500 pound SAP bombs in lieu of torpedoes, was launched. At 11:18, a fourth strike was sent off to push the maneuvering enemy away from Leyte Gulf, but with neither torpedoes nor armor-piercing bombs aboard, the planes took off carrying only general-purpose bombs and depth charges. At noon, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;″s fighters, launched previously for CAP, were landed, rearmed and sent up again. At 12:56 and at 15:08, the 5th and 6th strikes were launched to further pursue the enemy as it retreated toward San Bernardino Strait. Fighter planes, armed with 250-pound (113 kg) general-purpose bombs, were among those dispatched with the last strike.

At the end of that fateful day&#x27;s operations, TG 77.4, with &quot;Taffy 3&quot; bearing the brunt of the damage, had turned back the Japanese Force. Praise for the escort carrier group was unbounded. They had &quot;...accomplished a task that only a large carrier task force should be expected to undertake...&quot; &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;″s contribution to the earning of this praise included one heavy cruiser sunk, one torpedo plane shot down, and hits on one battleship, three heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and one destroyer.

The following morning, 26 October, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;″s planes, continuing to pound the enemy, assisted in the sinking of a light cruiser and her accompanying destroyer in the Visayan Sea and then resumed support of ground forces on Leyte. On the 27th, her fighters strafed Japanese vessels in Ormoc Bay and then swung over Samar where they downed a Kawasaki Ki-61 &quot;Tony&quot;. A Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; was bagged on the 28th, and on 30 October the CVE sailed for Seeadler Harbor, arriving 4 November.

&quot;Natoma Bay&quot; got underway for Kossol Roads 27 November and departed from there 10 December to provide air cover for the Mindoro invasion convoys as they transited the Mindanao and Sulu Seas. On the 13th, kamikazes from Negros Island attacked the formation. Eleven were shot down, but three pressed home the attack. Two were downed by anti-aircraft fire, but the third scored on the destroyer &quot;Haraden&quot;. Japanese aerial attacks continued on the 14th and &quot;Natoma Bay’s&quot; fighters added seven A6M Zeros to their total.

During and after the Mindoro landings, 15 December, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; provided air cover and ground support, protecting screening vessels from kamikazes and strafing Japanese positions. After recovering her planes on the 16th, she retired to Kossol Roads, thence to Manus, returning to the Palaus at the end of the month.

===1945===
On 1 January 1945, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;, reassigned to CARDIV 25, sortied once again with ships of an attack force, the target this time, Luzon. There, after battling enemy nuisance and suicide raiders en route, she, with five other CVEs, provided air cover for the Bombardment and Fire Support Group prior to the landings, and direct air support ahead of the amphibious troops after the assault in the San Fabian area. Between the 10th and the 17th her continuous direct air support missions resulted in the damage and destruction of bridges, fuel and ammunition dumps, barracks, roads and vehicles.

After replenishment at Mindoro, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; cruised west of Mindoro until the 29th. She then moved into position to support amphibious landings on the west coast of Zambales Province and at Subic Bay, remaining there until 1 February. Her task group, 77.4, then retired, reaching Ulithi on the 5th.

She sortied 10 February with TU 52.2.1, to provide air cover en route to and during the Iwo Jima assault. Between the 16th and the 19th, her planes flew 123 sorties to prepare the way for the assault marines. On D-day, 19 February, 36 sorties provided direct support, while another 16 provided CAP cover. After the 19th, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; expanded her duties to include antisubmarine and air coordinator missions, and in March, to anti-shipping assignments.

&quot;Natoma Bay&quot; departed the Volcano-Bonin area 8 March, entering Ulithi Lagoon on the 11th. There squadron VC-9 replaced VC-81 and by the 21st, was ready for &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;″s next operation, Okinawa. With TU 52.1.1, the escort carrier provided air cover for the pre-invasion bombardment and Occupation of Kerama Retto, 24 March1 April. She then shifted her attention to Okinawa itself. For the next three months except for brief repair periods, her planes bombed and strafed strategic and tactical targets; flew observation and spotting, photographic and propaganda missions; dropped provisions and munitions in advance areas; and conducted combat air and anti-submarine patrols.

At 06:35, 7 June, after having maneuvered through typhoon weather, &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; was closed by a Zero, broad on the port quarter and low on the water. Changing course, it came in over the stern, fired incendiary ammunition at the bridge, and on reaching the island structure, nosed over and crashed the flight deck. The engine, propeller and a bomb tore a hole in the flight deck, , while the explosion of the bomb damaged the deck of the forecastle and the anchor windlass beyond repair and ignited a nearby fighter. Three of &quot;Natoma Bay&quot;″s crew and one officer of VC–9 were wounded. One ship&#x27;s officer was killed. A second Zero was splashed by the ship&#x27;s port batteries. The damage control party immediately extinguished the blaze and set about emergency repairs. The next strike was cancelled, but the following one, against Miayako Shima, took place as scheduled at 10:30.

===Post-war activities===
On 20 June the escort carrier headed for Guam for partial repairs, then continued on to the United States. By 19 August, when she arrived in San Diego, the war was over. During September and October she underwent repairs, alterations and general overhaul, after which she reported for duty as a &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; transport. During November and early December she carried servicemen from the Philippines to California, then after detachment, 29 December, she was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
Reporting 20 February 1946, she decommissioned 20 May, berthing at Norfolk. In October 1949, she was reassigned to the Boston Reserve Group. Reclassified CVU–62 on 12 June 1955, she was declared unfit for further service in 1958 and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September. She was sold on 30 July 1959 for scrap to the Japanese.

==Awards==
&quot;Natoma Bay&quot; earned seven battle stars for her World War II service on the Asiatic-Pacific theater medal and two bronze stars on the Philippine Liberation medal. &quot;Natoma Bay&quot; also earned a Presidential Unit Citation, taking part in 13 operations in World War II, not including the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

<text>The Fraser Institute is a libertarian-conservative Canadian public policy think tank and registered charity. It is headquartered in Vancouver, with additional offices in Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal. It has links to think tanks worldwide through the Economic Freedom Network and is a member of the free-market Atlas Network.

In 2020, the &quot;Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; ranked Fraser as 14th of the &quot;Top Think Tanks Worldwide&quot; and 1 in the &quot;Top Think Tanks in Mexico and Canada&quot;.

==History==
The Fraser Institute was founded in 1974 by Michael Walker, an economist from the University of Western Ontario, and businessman T. Patrick Boyle, then a vice-president of MacMillan Bloedel. The institute is named after the Fraser River. According to CBC News, some people allege that Michael Walker helped set up the institute after he received financial backing from forestry giant MacMillan Bloedel, largely to counter British Columbia&#x27;s NDP government, then led by premier Dave Barrett.

Antony Fisher, who had founded the Institute of Economic Affairs in the United Kingdom, was a co-founder. It obtained charitable status in Canada on October 22, 1974, and in the United States in 1978. It is a member of the Atlas Network, which Fisher founded in 1981. Fisher was appointed acting director in 1975, until Walker became executive director in 1977.

In late 1997, the institute set up a research program emulating the UK&#x27;s Social Affairs Unit, called the Social Affairs Centre. Its founding director was Patrick Basham. The program&#x27;s funding came from Rothmans International and Philip Morris. When Rothmans was bought by British American Tobacco (BAT) in 1999, its funding ended, and in 2000 the institute wrote to BAT asking for $50,000 per year, to be split between the Social Affairs Centre and the Centre for Risk and Regulation. The letter highlighted the institute&#x27;s 1999 publication &quot;Passive Smoke: The EPA&#x27;s Betrayal of Science and Policy&quot;, &quot;which highlighted the absence of any scientific evidence for linking cancer with second-hand smoke [and] received widespread media coverage both in Canada and the United States&quot;. At this time the CEO of BAT&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary, Imasco, was also on the Fraser Institute&#x27;s board of trustees.

In 1999, the Fraser Institute was criticized by health professionals and scientists for sponsoring two conferences on the tobacco industry entitled &quot;Junk Science, Junk Policy? Managing Risk and Regulation&quot; and &quot;Should Government Butt Out? The Pros and Cons of Tobacco Regulation.&quot; Critics charged the institute was associating itself with the tobacco industry&#x27;s many attempts to discredit authentic scientific work.

The Fraser Institute accepted donations worth $100,000 from Philip Morris for &quot;publishing research studies&quot; in 2011–2012. Research produced by the Institute has previously argued that &quot;tobacco taxation causes smuggling&quot;, a common claim by corporations in the industry that has been disputed by public health officials and critics as exaggerated and erroneous.

According to the January 2020 &quot;Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), Fraser is number 14 (of 8,200) in the &quot;Top Think Tanks Worldwide&quot; and number 1 in the &quot;Top Think Tanks in Mexico and Canada&quot;.

==Staff==
In April 2012, economist Niels Veldhuis was appointed president. The institute is governed by a board of trustees. Current members of the board include Peter Brown (chairman), Mark Mitchell (vice-chairman), and Edward Belzberg (vice-chairman).

From 1979 to 1991, the institute&#x27;s senior economist was Walter Block.

==Ideology==
The Fraser Institute describes itself as &quot;an independent, non-partisan research and educational organization&quot;, and envisions &quot;a free and prosperous world where individuals benefit from greater choice, competitive markets, and personal responsibility&quot;. The Fraser Institute&#x27;s stated mission is &quot;to measure, study, and communicate the impact of competitive markets and government intervention on the welfare of individuals.&quot;

&quot;Forbes&quot; has referred to the think tank as libertarian. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described the institute as libertarian. &quot;Langley Times&quot; classified it as right-of-centre libertarian.

== Activities ==

=== Research and publications ===

The institute self-publishes a variety of reports:
* Economic Freedom Index: The institute&#x27;s annual Economic Freedom of the World index ranks the countries of the world according to their degrees of economic freedom. The institute has also published regional and sub-national reports ranking the economic freedom of North America, Latin America, the Arab World, and the Francophonie. These reports are distributed worldwide through the Economic Freedom Network, a global network of 80 think-tanks.
* Human Freedom Index: Along with the Cato Institute and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, the Fraser Institute publishes annual Human Freedom Index, which presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure of 76 distinct indicators that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. The index presents a broad measure of human freedom, understood as the absence of coercive constraint. The index covers the following areas: Rule of Law, Security and Safety, Movement, Religion, Association, Assembly, and Civil Society, Expression, Relationships, Size of Government, Legal System and Property Rights, Access to Sound Money, Freedom to Trade Internationally, and Regulation of Credit, Labor, and Business. The Human Freedom Index was created in 2015, covering 152 countries for years 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In January 2016 data for 2013 was added, covering 157 countries.
* Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada is the institute&#x27;s annual report on hospital waiting times in Canada, based on a nationwide survey of physicians and health care practitioners. The twentieth annual survey, released December 2010, found that the total waiting time between referral from a general practitioner and delivery of elective treatment by a specialist, averaged across 12 specialties and 10 provinces surveyed, had risen from 16.1 weeks in 2009 to 18.2 weeks in 2010.
* Survey of Mining Companies: Published annually, the global &quot;Survey of Mining Companies&quot; ranks the investment climates of mining jurisdictions around the world, based on the opinions of mining industry executives and managers.
* Global Petroleum Survey: An annual survey of petroleum executives regarding barriers to investment in oil- and gas-producing regions around the world.
* Canadian Provincial Investment Climate: A series of reports measuring the extent to which Canadian provinces embrace public policies that contribute to, and sustain, positive investment climates.
* Firearms reports. The Fraser Institute issued a number of articles and statements opposing Canadian gun control laws, including firearms registry.
* School Report Cards: Every year, the institute publishes a series of &quot;School Report Cards&quot; ranking the academic performance of schools in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Washington state based on the publicly available results of standardized testing mandated and administered by the provinces. The website www.compareschoolrankings.org allows users to compare up to five schools at once, based on a variety of performance indicators.
* Tax Freedom Day: The institute&#x27;s annual &quot;Tax Freedom Day&quot; report calculates the day the average Canadian family has paid off the total tax bill and royalties imposed on them and corporations by all levels of government. In 2016, Tax Freedom Day was June 7 with $45,167 (42.9 per cent of income) having been collected per family. The institute also offers a personal &quot;Tax Freedom Day&quot; calculator.
* The institute publishes three magazines: &quot;Fraser Forum&quot;, a bi-monthly review of public policy in Canada; &quot;Perspectives&quot;, a French-language review of public policy in Quebec and la Francophonie; and &quot;Canadian Student Review&quot;, a look at current affairs written for students, by students.
* In March 2010, the institute released &quot;Did Government Stimulus Fuel Economic Growth in Canada? An Analysis of Statistics Canada Data&quot;, a report critical of the Harper government&#x27;s Economic Action Plan, concluding that the stimulus package did not have a material impact on Canada&#x27;s economic turnaround in the latter half of 2009.

=== Other initiatives ===

The Fraser Institute also offers an internship program, to which more than 431 individuals applied in 2010.

==Funding==
As a registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency, the institute files annual registered charity information returns. The institute also files annual returns to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, where it is registered as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. The institute depends on contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations. It does not accept government grants or payments for research; however, individual donors may claim tax credits for donations and corporate donors may claim tax deductions. The Fraser Institute ceased disclosing its sources of corporate funding in the 1980s.

In its first full year of operation, 1975, the institute reported revenues of $421,389. In 1988, revenues exceeded $1 million, and in 2003, $6 million. In 2022, the institute reported having almost CA$12 million in annual revenue.

The institute has received donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars from foundations controlled by Charles and David Koch, with total donations estimated to be approximately $765,000 from 2006 to 2016. It also received US$120,000 from ExxonMobil in the 2003 to 2004 fiscal period. In 2016, it received a $5 million donation from Peter Munk, a Canadian businessman.

In 2012, the &quot;Vancouver Observer&quot; reported that the Fraser Institute had &quot;received over $4.3 million in the last decade from eight major American foundations including the most powerful players in oil and pharmaceuticals&quot;. According to the article, &quot;The Fraser Institute received $1.7 million from &#x27;sources outside Canada&#x27; in one year alone, according to the group&#x27;s 2010 Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) return. Fraser Institute President Niels Veldhuis told &quot;The Vancouver Observer&quot; that the Fraser Institute does accept foreign funding, but he declined to comment on any specific donors or details about the donations.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; (CVE-74) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after Nehenta Bay, located within Gravina Island. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in November 1943, and commissioned in January 1944, and served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in May 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in June 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 20 July 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1111, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot;, after a bay in Gravina Island, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 28 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Robert H. Lewis; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 3 January 1944, with Captain Horace Bushnell Butterfield in command.

==Service history==
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Francisco. She then underwent a transport mission to Pearl Harbor on 6 February, carrying a load of replacement aircraft and military personnel. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 February, where she took on a load of damaged planes which required repairs. She arrived at San Diego on 21 February, where she unloaded her cargo. After training exercises off the Southern California coast, she made another transport run to Hawaii on 18 March. After stopping at Hawaii, she proceeded westwards to Majuro, arriving there on 7 April. She then returned to San Diego, stopping at Pearl Harbor along the way, and arriving on 27 April, carrying wounded military personnel, as well as nonfunctional aircraft.

&quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; then conducted additional exercises off the West Coast, and steamed for Hawaii, where additional combat readiness training ensued. After finishing her exercises, she left Pearl Harbor on 18 June, bound for the Mariana Islands, in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. She joined Task Group 52.14, under the command of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan. With Composite Squadron 11 (VC-11) on-board, she was based on newly-captured Enewetak Atoll. There, her aircraft conducted antisubmarine patrols, and provided close air support covering the Battle of Tinian. Notably, her aircraft strafed Tinian on 5 and 7 July, attacking gun emplacements and a sugar refinery. She returned to Enewetak on 16 July to refuel and replenish. She then joined the then (later renamed the &quot;St. Lo&quot;), along with twelve destroyer escorts, in conducting antisubmarine patrols off Guam and Saipan. In the meantime, she also launched strikes in support of the ongoing Battle of Saipan.

After finishing her patrol, she became a replenishment carrier, supporting the Third Fleet&#x27;s frontline Fast Carrier Task Force as part of Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group. She escorted vulnerable fleet oilers as they proceeded to the frontlines, protecting them from Japanese submarines and aircraft. Escort carriers such as &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time. She was based on Manus and Ulithi, where she received supplies and replacement aircraft. On 18 December, as part of Task Group 30.8.12, she braved Typhoon Cobra.

===Typhoon Cobra===
The Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel, and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. She rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 1:00 in the night, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded.
As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10, just after noon. He ordered his fleet to move to the next morning&#x27;s planned rendezvous spot, approximately northwest, and comfortably safe from the typhoon&#x27;s impacts. Two hours later, he instead ordered his fleet to proceed due southwards, from where the fleet was located. This brought the fleet directly into the typhoon&#x27;s core. To make matters worse for the Third Fleet, Halsey ordered the fleet to proceed northwards at 22:20, putting the fleet in the quadrant of the typhoon with the highest winds. Blurry data and observations meant that command had little idea of where the typhoon actually was, with some weather maps pinning the typhoon&#x27;s center some away, even whilst the fleet sailed directly into the eye. Attached to the Third Fleet, &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; followed.

At 7:00, on the morning of 18 December, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon&#x27;s path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 7:22, &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; came to course at 60°, along with and . As &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; struggled to maintain her course, massive waves crested over her flight deck. Captain Butterfield radioed to Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. that &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; could not continue on her given path, and asked for permission to change course. At 7:52, McCain replied to the affirmative, and &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; turned due south. At the time, she was rolling at about 30° to 37°, a dangerous angle for an aircraft carrier. Steering control was momentarily lost due to the typhoon, but it was quickly regained. To maintain steerageway, she increased her speed to , before Butterfield decided that it would be easier to change the ship on a northwesterly heading.

This change in course stabilized &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot;. Her rolls steadied to a bit less than 30°, but her crew still had to fight to stay in control against heavy seas and gusty winds. A full rudder was required to keep her bow aligned against gusts of up to . Eventually, the winds died down, and &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; emerged from the storm with relatively little damage. Only three planes on her flight deck had been carried overboard, with another blown loose and stuck on a catwalk. The 20-mm cannon mounted on said catwalk had been ejected from the carrier as a result of the collision. There was minor damage on the flight deck, but her loss in cargo and hull integrity was little compared to her fellow ships of Task Group 30.8.

===Battle of Okinawa===

She continued her replenishment duties after the typhoon, and on 27 December, Captain Edward Orrick McDonnell took over command of the vessel. On 12 January 1945, her aircraft contingent saw some action. At the time, she was providing cover and support for the vulnerable fleet oilers. At 7:10 in the morning, an Aichi E13A reconnaissance seaplane was detected by radar about away from &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot;. A squadron of fighters was launched in response to the threat, and the Japanese plane was engaged by fighters away from the task group. After an unsuccessful attempt to disengage, the seaplane spiraled into the ocean. On 17 January, whilst &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; was operating in the South China Sea, she once again suffered damage as a result of the weather. Throughout the day, refueling operations had been hampered by heavy surf and wind. At around 19:30, heavy waves, up to high, started cresting over the flight deck. Some steel supports near her bow buckled under the waves, and the flight deck bent down and sank, rendering the aircraft catapult inoperational. She continued to launch replacement aircraft, although her duties were cut back.

She was discharged from her Task Group, and returned to San Diego on 19 February for overhaul and repairs. She then proceeded for Hawaii, where training exercises were conducted. She then briefly served as a training carrier, conducting pilot qualifications off of Guam, before arriving at Ulithi on 9 May, where she prepared to begin operations in support of the landings on Okinawa. She joined Task Unit 52.1 under Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin in May, with Composite Squadron 8 (VC-8) onboard. She then began flying missions and making strikes as U.S. forces advanced down the island. During this period, her task group came under frequent kamikaze attacks, most notably on 7 June, when two carriers were struck by aircraft. After finishing her duties, she once again served as a replenishment carrier until the end of the war, guarding fleet oilers as they transited towards the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was launching strikes against the Japanese home islands.

===Post-war===
She was en route to the Aleutian Islands when the Japanese surrender was announced on 15 August. On 31 August, &quot;Nehenta Bay&quot; sailed to Mutsu Bay in support of the Occupation of Japan. There, she watched on as Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher accepted the formal surrender of Japanese forces in northern Honshu and Hokkaido on 6 September. Her aircraft contingent dropped supplies to prisoners of war, and conducted patrols as U.S. forces landed throughout the Japanese islands.

She returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 September, where she disembarked her aircraft squadron, aviation equipment, and excess gasoline. She then joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She first made a run to the Marshall Islands on 30 September, repatriating them to San Francisco in mid-October. She then made another run to the Philippines throughout November, returning to the West Coast on 27 November. She was then discharged from the Magic Carpet fleet, and steamed for Boston, passing through the Panama Canal. She arrived on 31 January 1946, whereupon inactivation work was conducted. She was decommissioned on 15 May, and mothballed as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Berthed at the East Boston Naval Annex, she suffered extensive damage on 31 August 1954 as a result of Hurricane Carol, which toppled a dockyard crane onto her flight deck.

She was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-74, on 12 June 1955. She was once again redesignated, this time as an aircraft transport, AKV-24, on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and sold on 29 June 1960 to Coalmarket Inc. for scrapping. She was ultimately broken up in Hong Kong during June 1960. She received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="554039" wikidata="Q7874237" url="?curid=554039" title="USS Solomons">
<text>USS &quot;Solomons&quot; (CVE-67) was the thirteenth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first Navy vessel named after the Solomon Islands campaign, a lengthy operation that most famously included the Guadalcanal campaign, albeit she was not the first named &quot;Solomons&quot;. The ship was launched in October 1943, commissioned in November, and served in anti-submarine operations during the Battle of the Atlantic, as well as in other miscellaneous training and transport missions. Her frontline duty consisted of four anti-submarine patrols, with her third tour being the most notable, when her aircraft contingent sank the during her third combat patrol. She was decommissioned in August 1946, being mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was broken up in 1947.

==Design and description==

&quot;Solomons&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and was designed specifically to be rapidly mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. By the end of their production run, the time taken between laying down the hull and launching the ship had been cut down to nearly one month. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size limited the length of the flight deck and necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the number of Bofors guns had been doubled to 16, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more, which was often necessary during transport or especially training missions, due to the constant turnover of pilots and aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 19 March 1943 under the name &quot;Emperor&quot;, with the intention of transferring her to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease. She was laid down as MC hull 1104, the thirteenth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. On 28 June 1943, with the having been designated to be transferred in her place, &quot;Emperor&quot; was redesignated as an auxiliary aircraft carrier and therefore received the hull symbol ACV-67, indicating that she was the sixty-seventh escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. As a part of this change, she was also renamed to &quot;Nassuk Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. On 15 July, with the handover of &quot;Pybus&quot; having been completed, she was redesignated as an escort carrier and received her final hull symbol of CVE-67. She was launched on 6 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. F. J. McKenna; transferred to the Navy, renamed to &quot;Solomons&quot; as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements, and commissioned on 21 November 1943, with Captain Marion Edward Crist in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Solomons&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise in the area between Puget Sound and Astoria, Oregon, conducting tests, evaluations, and training exercises for four weeks. She left Astoria on 20 December, making a stop at Alameda, California on 23 December, and arriving at San Diego on 25 December. There, after conducting some more exercises, she departed for Pearl Harbor on 30 December. On 6 January 1944, she took on a load of passengers, supplies, as well as dysfunctional aircraft to be taken to the West Coast for repairs or salvage. She left on 9 January, arriving back at San Diego on 14 January. For the rest of January, she conducted battle practices off of southern California. She left San Diego with a load of aircraft on 30 January for the East Coast. As she approached the Panama Canal, her aircraft participated in a simulated aerial attack on the canal in order to test its defenses. She stopped at Balboa, Panama on 9 February, where she embarked passengers, and departed on 11 February, arriving at the naval station in Norfolk, Virginia, on 16 February.
At Norfolk, &quot;Solomons&quot; took on her aircraft contingent of Composite Squadron (VC) 9, supplies, and aviation stores, before putting out to sea on 21 March for Brazil. She arrived at Recife on 13 April, and upon arriving, joined the United States Fourth Fleet for anti-submarine duties in the South Atlantic, under the command of Vice admiral Jonas H. Ingram. She joined Task Group 46.1, which centered around &quot;Solomons&quot;, screened by the destroyer escorts , , , and . On 14 April, she began her first anti-submarine patrol. Her first patrol, which lasted until 30 April, proved to be uneventful. The only indications of possible contact were some green flares spotted on the morning of 22 April, as well as some unsuccessful Hedgehog attacks on a signature that might have been Her second patrol, from 4 May to 20 May, had even less activity.
&quot;Solomons&quot; departed Recife for her third patrol on 30 May. A submarine had been spotted off of Salvador proceeding to the northeast, and the task group was dispatched after it, without any results. The task group spent the front half of its patrol chasing several signature reports, including one about a Japanese flying boat, but with no results. However, high-frequency direction finding had picked up a lead of a U-boat off of southwestern Africa heading on a northwesterly course on 9 June. Thus, the task group went to the northeast, in a direction to possibly intercept.

In the midst of her patrol, on 15 June, one of VC-9&#x27;s Avenger torpedo bombers, piloted by Ens. G.E. Edwards, reported a contact at a bearing of 70 degrees and some from the carrier at 10:21. The Avenger proceeded towards the contact, and there was no further word relayed back. In fact, it had spotted the Type IXD2 at 12:21 as it proceeded approximately south of St. Helena. The Avenger immediately made four attack runs against &quot;U-860&quot;, and was shot down by antiaircraft fire on the fourth run, killing all three of the Avenger&#x27;s crew. However, the Avenger had managed to inflict enough damage on the submarine such that it could not safely dive, something that would later prove fatal for &quot;U-860&quot;. It was not until 14:00 that a group was cobbled together on &quot;Solomons&quot; to investigate Chamberlain&#x27;s report. At 17:22, VC-9&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant commander H.M. Avery, spotted a wake about away. Proceeding closer, he could observe that it was &quot;U-860&quot; on a southeasterly course, proceeding at about , whereupon he immediately issued a contact report back to &quot;Solomons&quot;. Two of &quot;Solomons&quot;″s screening vessels, the destroyer escorts &quot;Straub&quot; and &quot;Herzog&quot;, were immediately dispatched to Avery&#x27;s contact. As the Avenger moved closer, the gunners on &quot;U-860&quot; threw up a screen of flak, convincing Avery to wait for reinforcements. As Avery was transmitting his contact report back, two Wildcat fighters and one Avenger were preparing to land on &quot;Solomons&quot;, having been unsuccessful in spotting any targets. Upon receiving the news, the three aircraft turned around and headed to join Avery.

The three aircraft rendezvoused with Avery, and a series of three organized attacks were planned, which were launched at 19:46, under the waning evening sun. In the first attack, &quot;U-860&quot; was first strafed by the two Wildcats piloted by Ens. T.J. Wadsworth and Ens. R.E. McMahon, whilst the submarine moved in evasive circles, unable to dive. Hits were observed on the submarine&#x27;s deck, conning tower, and bandstand. As the two Wildcats pulled up from their dive, only about above &quot;U-860&quot;, Wadsworth&#x27;s Wildcat was damaged by flak in a wing tank, forcing him to return to &quot;Solomons&quot;. The two Avengers, piloted by Avery and Ens. M.J. Spear, followed up with rockets as the Wildcats were being harried by flak. The pilots of VC-9 had been trained to aim their rockets to hit to the fore of the conning tower, where the most vulnerable systems laid. Spear&#x27;s Avenger, flying from the aft of the submarine, fired eight rockets from , six of which were observed connecting with the U-boat just to the starboard fore of the conning tower. Avery&#x27;s Avenger, flying from the fore, fired six rockets from , all of which connected with the front of the U-boat, some in front of the conning tower.

Following this attack, &quot;U-860&quot; started to slow down, and turned southwards. At 17:51, two more aircraft arrived on the scene, two Avengers, one piloted by Lieutenant, junior grade W.F. Chamberlain, and one piloted by Lieutenant, junior grade D.E. Weigle. The two aircraft immediately engaged &quot;U-860&quot;, with McMahon&#x27;s Wildcat making another strafing run to try to suppress antiaircraft fire. In the second attack, Weigle, running in from the fore, fired eight rockets, six of which connected in the area to the fore of the conning tower. Following this run, &quot;U-860&quot; slowed down to just a crawl, at only . In the third, and final attack, Chamberlain, charging from the port, dropped two depth charges directly forward of the conning tower whilst Lt. Cdr. Avery strafed &quot;U-860&quot; to suppress antiaircraft fire. However, Chamberlain proceeded much too low, dropping the depth charges only over the submarine. The explosions rocked his aircraft, starting a fire in the bomb bay and in the central cockpit. Chamberlain maintained a semblance of control, and came to a relatively soft landing to the starboard of the sinking U-boat. &quot;U-860&quot; sank after this last attack, at 19:53, with 42 of her crew going down with the ship.

&quot;Straub&quot; and &quot;Herzog&quot; arrived during the night. Under the darkness, the two destroyers were forced to rely heavily upon &quot;Solomon&quot;″s aircraft, which fired starshells and dropped flares. First, they attempted to recover Chamberlain and his crew, but were unable to find any trace of them. They then proceeded to the submarine&#x27;s wreck, where &quot;Straub&quot; began rescuing survivors, whilst &quot;Herzog&quot; provided a screen. &quot;Straub&quot; eventually recovered 21 crewmen, including &quot;U-860&quot;″s commander, Fregattenkapitän Paul Büchel. One of the survivors was resuscitated only after twenty minutes of artificial respiration. &quot;Solomons&quot; continued her third patrol until 23 June, when she returned to Recife to refuel and to disembark the captured German sailors.
Following a fourth anti-submarine patrol, as well as a stop at Rio de Janeiro, &quot;Solomons&quot; sailed back north to Naval Station Norfolk, arriving on 24 August. She moored at Norfolk for a month before heading for Staten Island, New York, docking there on 25 September. She took on a load of 150 army airmen along with their P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, and departed on 6 October, on a mission to ferry them to Casablanca, French Morocco. She was back at the East Coast on 7 November, anchored within Narrangansett Bay, Rhode Island.

For the rest of 1944, &quot;Solomons&quot; served as a training carrier, qualifying Navy and Marine pilots in carrier landings, initially off of Quonset Point. In January 1945, she steamed southwards to Port Everglades, Florida, where she continued to qualify pilots throughout the rest of 1945. At Port Everglades, Captain Richard Stanley Moss raised his flag over the vessel. For a week in December 1945, she was diverted from her mission to participate in a search for the 14 missing airmen of Flight 19, as well as the 13 airmen from a Martin PBM Mariner flying boat that went missing after being dispatched to look for Flight 19. On 15 February 1946, Captain Allen Smith Jr. took over command of the vessel.

Having finished her qualification duties, &quot;Solomons&quot; proceeded northwards to the naval shipyard at Boston, Massachusetts, where she was decommissioned, on 15 May, joining the Boston group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Navy list on 5 June 1946, and she was sold for scrapping in December 1946 to the Patapsco Scrap Corp., headquartered at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. She was delivered to its agent at Newport on 22 December. She was ultimately broken up in 1947.

<text>USS &quot;Steamer Bay&quot; (CVE-87) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after Steamer Bay, located within Etolin Island, Alaska. Launched in February 1944, and commissioned in April, she served in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, the Invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in January 1947, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in August 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Steamer Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, &quot;Steamer Bay&quot; was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar decks: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20–mm cannons, and the amount of 40–mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, the Invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 16 FM-2 Wildcat fighters, and 12 TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 4 December 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1124, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named &quot;Steamer Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 26 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry S. Kendall; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 4 April 1944, Captain Myron Steadman Teller in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

After being commissioned, &quot;Steamer Bay&quot; conducted trials and went on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast, before arriving at San Diego. On 14 May, she sailed for the New Hebrides, transporting Marine Air Group (MAG) 61. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 30 May, where her cargo was unloaded. She departed on 2 June, arriving at San Diego on 20 June. On 19 July, she loaded 298 marines and 72 aircraft, and proceeded westwards for the Marshall Islands. She hence arrived at Majuro on 1 August, where she discharged her cargo. She headed for Pearl Harbor, where she was attached to the United States Third Fleet to store replacement aircraft to support the ongoing Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign. Seventy-two planes were loaded onto &quot;Steamer Bay&quot;, and she sailed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, arriving on 21 August. Throughout the next two and a half months, she remained on station, providing replacement aircraft and crew for Task Group 38. After completing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor, where she underwent repairs and training from 15 November to 5 December.

&quot;Steamer Bay&quot; departed back to Seeadler Harbor, arriving on 17 December. There, she was assigned to Task Group 77.4 (Taffy 2), commanded by Rear Admiral Felix Stump, which had previously participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The task force consisted of six escort carriers and their escorts. On 1 January 1945, the task force sortied out of Seeadler Harbor, in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. En route, the escort carriers came under heavy aerial attacks. Of the six carriers within Taffy 2, was sunk by a kamikaze plane on 4 January, and and were damaged by additional kamikazes on 5 January. &quot;Steamer Bay&quot; herself narrowly missed being hit, with a kamikaze once flying dangerously close to her stern. Throughout the landings, the escort carrier task groups anchored offshore launched over 1,400 aircraft sorties in support of the operation. In the middle of operations, Taffy 2 was reformed under Rear Admiral Felix Stump, partially because of the losses and damages suffered by the escort carriers. In anticipation for possible Japanese counterattacks on American positions on Mindoro and Luzon, the task group proceeded south to operate in the waters offshore Mindoro. &quot;Steamer Bay&quot; remained in the Philippine Islands with the rest of the 7th Fleet until 31 January, when she departed for Ulithi.

&quot;Steamer Bay&quot; was only anchored for five days, before she departed with the rest of the 5th Fleet, bound for Iwo Jima. She was incorporated into Carrier Division 26, under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, alongside four other escort carriers. The task group began operations, west of Iwo Jima, on 16 February. The task group&#x27;s mission was to neutralize Japanese bases and positions along the Nanpō Islands until 19 February (D-Day). The task group then provided close air support for the marines throughout the landings and the costly struggle throughout the island.

&quot;Steamer Bay&quot;, along with , was relieved on 7 March, and then proceeded to Leyte. They arrived at San Pedro Bay on 12 March, where she prepared for the upcoming invasion of Okinawa Island. She sailed for the Ryukyu Islands on 27 March, arriving in her operating area south of the island on the morning of 1 April. Operations were complicated by uncooperative weather and choppy seas. On 3 April, a sailor was cast overboard when a railing broke. His body was not recovered. She conducted operations until 26 May when she was relieved, and sailed to Apra Harbor, Guam, for repairs and rest. On 10 June, she was ordered to join the 3rd Fleet east of Miyako Jima assisted her task group in neutralizing Japanese airfields on Sakishima Gunto. She conducted air strikes against the airfields from 14 June to 22 June, before sailing for Ulithi.

&quot;Steamer Bay&quot; left Ulithi on 3 July, part of the Logistics Support Group, responsible for resupplying the fast carrier forces with aircraft during operations against the Japanese mainland. On 20 July, she was detached and sailed, making stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor, for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 10 August.

===Post war===
&quot;Steamer Bay&quot; was in dry dock when the Japanese surrender was announced. When repairs were finished, she became a part of the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. To support her new role, bunk beds were installed within the hangar deck to accommodate veterans returning from overseas. On 28 September, she sailed for Pearl Harbor, on her first Magic Carpet run.

After completing her Magic Carpet duties, &quot;Steamer Bay&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 4 February 1946, and berthed at Tacoma, Washington. In January 1947, she was placed in reserve, and decommissioned. Her designation was changed to CVHE-87 on 12 June 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and sold to Hyman-Michaels Co., Chicago, Illinois, on 29 August 1959, for scrapping. She received six battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="554042" wikidata="Q7874183" url="?curid=554042" title="USS Sitkoh Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; (CVE-86) was the thirty-second of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Sitkoh Bay, located within Chichagof Island, of the Territory of Alaska. The ship was launched in February 1944, commissioned in March, and served as a replenishment and transport carrier throughout the Philippines campaign, the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. She was decommissioned in November 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. With the outbreak of the Korean War, however, she was called back to service, continuing to serve as a transport and utility carrier with the Military Sealift Command until 1954, when she was once again decommissioned, and mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was broken up in January 1961.

==Design and description==
&quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall; at the waterline, she was long. She had a beam of , at her widest point, this was . She also had a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Power was provided by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more, which was often necessary during transport or replenishment missions.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 23 November 1943 under the name &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1123, the thirty-second of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-86, indicating that she was the eighty-sixth escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. She was launched on 19 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Kathryn Mullinix, the widow of Rear admiral Henry M. Mullinnix, who had perished when her sister was sunk by the ; transferred to the Navy and commissioned on 28 March 1944, with Captain Robert Green Lockhart in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to Naval Air Station Alameda, and upon arriving on 28 April, she took on a load of cargo and passengers. She left Alameda on 30 April, bound for Pearl Harbor, and for the next half-year, she carried out routine transport missions between California and various bases scattered throughout the Central and South Pacific, as a part of Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Group, under the command of Captain Jasper T. Acuff. For example, during the latter part of 1944, she touched Majuro in the Marshall Islands, Manus in the Admiralty Islands, transiting via Pearl Harbor. The aircraft and passengers delivered on these transport missions went to the United States Third Fleet and the United States Seventh Fleet, respectively, although the ship&#x27;s action report did note that a significant portion of these replenishment aircraft were recycled from damaged carriers returning to the backline, and that they were often in rather poor condition. The air personnel that were delivered could also be of questionable quality, with some sitting in the reserve pool rarely flying for up to eight months. For example, the flight surgeon of &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; reported visiting a pilot who suffered from epilepsy, and another pilot who displayed a suicidal ideation regarding hurling himself into a spinning propeller.

In January 1945, &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; became a replenishment carrier solely dedicated to resupplying the Third Fleet within the Central Pacific, as it participated in the Philippines campaign, the Invasion of Iwo Jima, and prepared for the Battle of Okinawa. During this period, her ports of call included Guam and Roi-Namur, both in the Marianas Islands, Enewetak Atoll in the Marshalls, and Ulithi Atoll, located in the Caroline Islands. On one of these stops, Captain James Paul Walker raised his flag over the vessel on 1 February.

&quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; continued these replenishment duties until 1 April, when she joined up with the Special Escort Carrier Group, along with her sisters , , and the . The escort carriers were screened by the s and , as well as the s and . Together, the four escort carriers had the task of delivering Marine Aircraft Group 31, of which &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; was assigned to transport, and Marine Aircraft Group 33, in total consisting of 192 F4U Corsairs and 30 F6F Hellcats to Okinawa. There, they would be the first land-based aircraft to participate in the battle, operating off of the captured Kadena Air Base.
The Special Escort Carrier Group departed from Ulithi on 2 April, and &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; arrived off of Okinawa on 6 April without much incident, although the screening destroyers dropped depth charges on the way to deter a suspected submarine. Therefore, she began transferring her air contingent to land. On 7 April, however, the escort carriers came under kamikaze attack. At the time, she was southeast of Okinawa, and at around noon that day, she began launching some F4U-4C variant Corsairs to Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. By 15:28, she had already launched eight Corsairs, and the flight deck was being respotted when a Yokosuka P1Y kamikaze aircraft made an appearance. The kamikaze was engaged by five fighters of VMF-311 operating off of &quot;Breton&quot;, and although they did heavily damage the aircraft and set it on fire, the kamikaze was able to get close enough to make a dive for the bridge of &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot;. The kamikaze was met by heavy anti-aircraft fire, and it wobbled, ultimately crashing about off the carrier&#x27;s port beam, with the kill being accredited to Lieutenant John J. Doherty. The following day, on 8 April, she left the area for Pearl Harbor, stopping at Guam. There, she returned to her previous replenishment routine.

After the announcement of the Surrender of Japan on 15 August, &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; continued her replenishment duties with the Third Fleet, cruising with it along the southeastern coast of Honshū from 25 August to 5 September. On 10 September, she entered Enewetak harbor, before departing on 11 September for Guam. She then made transport missions ferrying between Guam, Samar Island in the Philippines, and Okinawa. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 October, and proceeded eastwards, arriving at San Diego on 26 October for availability. After a series of further transport missions to the Central Pacific throughout the rest of 1945 and 1946, she steamed into Bremerton, Washington on 30 November 1946, where she was decommissioned and mothballed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, as part of its Bremerton group.

===Korean War===
&quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; continued to be mothballed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet until the Korean War broke out during the summer of 1950. With the United States intervening in the war, under the auspices of the United Nations, &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; was recommissioned and reclassified as an aircraft transport with the hull symbol T-CVE-86 on 29 July 1950 at Bremerton, with Captain Charles Williams Lord in command. As an aircraft transport, she was operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) with a civilian crew, but with a military command. For the next four years, she transported aircraft between the West Coast and Japan. Her major ports of call were San Francisco, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Yokohama, and Yokosuka.

&quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; only deviated from these ports of call three times during this time period. In March 1951, she delivered a load of F8F Bearcats to French Indochina, where the French were fighting against the Viet Minh in the First Indochina War. On her way back, she stopped at Manila, the capital of the Philippines. In September 1951, she visited Pusan, Republic of Korea. In May 1952, she sailed directly from Yokosuka back to San Francisco, without stopping at Pearl Harbor on the way back.

With the end of the Korean War, the demand for aircraft in the Pacific theater decreased. Therefore, &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; was decommissioned again on 27 July 1954, when she rejoined the Pacific Reserve Fleet, this time as part of its San Francisco group. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, receiving the hull symbol CVU-86. In mid-March 1958, she was moved south from San Francisco to San Diego. On 7 May 1959, she was redesignated as an aviation transport, receiving the hull symbol AKV-86. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and subsequently sold for scrapping to Eisenberg &amp; Co. of New York City on 30 August. The ship was ultimately scrapped in Japan throughout January 1961. &quot;Sitkoh Bay&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service, and one for her Korean War service.

<text>USS &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; (CVE-84) was the thirtieth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Shamrock Bay, located within Baranof Island, of the Territory of Alaska. The ship was launched in February 1944, commissioned in March, and served in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in July 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was broken up in November 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, which remains the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, as the class was designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 20 FM-2 Wildcat fighters, 11 TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bombers, and a TBM-3P photo reconnaissance plane for a total of 32 aircraft. However, during the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers for a total of 30 aircraft.

==Construction==
&quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;″s construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. She was laid down on 15 November 1943 under the name &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; as part of the tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. As the thirtieth of a series of fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers, she was laid down as MC hull 1121. She was launched on 4 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. James R. Dudley, and then transferred to the Navy for commissioning on 15 March 1944, with Captain Frank Trenwith Ward Jr. in command. Upon being commissioned, she received the classification symbol CVE-84, indicating that she was the eighty-fourth escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy.

==Service history==


Upon being commissioned, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast, after which she conducted pilot qualifications until June 1944. She was then assigned transport duty within the Atlantic Ocean, first conducting a transport run ferrying fighters and military passengers to Casablanca, French Morocco. She then took on a load of damaged P-40 Warhawk fighters, which she transported back to the United States to be used in training and/or salvaged, as well as a load of aircraft engines, which when brought back to the States, would be overhauled or salvaged. She also took on another load of military passengers back to the East Coast, which consisted mostly of Army Air Corps personnel that had been serving in the China Burma India Theater.

On 27 October, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; had just returned to Norfolk, Virginia, after completing her second transport run, and she was fitting out for anti-submarine operations within the South Atlantic. However, with the loss of her sisters and in the Battle off Samar, U.S. Navy command found it judicious to dispatch &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; as a replacement within the Pacific theater. Therefore, after taking onboard Composite Squadron (VC) 42 on 11 November, which consisted of twenty-eight aircraft (16 FM-2 Wildcats and 12 TBM-3 Avengers) to be transported to Pearl Harbor, she sailed for the Pacific Ocean, along with .
&quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; passed through the Panama Canal on 18 November, and proceeding northwards, she docked at San Diego, California on 27 November. There, on 2 December, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 93. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 December, where she unloaded her aircraft contingent, and where she also took on Composite Squadron (VC) 94, which was to be her actual fighting aircraft contingent. On 11 December, she proceeded westwards, delivering some aircraft to Johnston Atoll en route. She arrived at Seeadler Harbor, on Manus Island of the Admiralty Islands on 22 December, where she joined with the 7th Fleet.

On 31 December, the American fleet departed from Seeadler Harbor, with the escort carriers being placed in Task Group 77.4, under the command of Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; and her sister were assigned to Rear Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie&#x27;s Task Unit 77.4.3, the Lingayen Protective Group. En route, until 8 January 1945, when the American fleet arrived within Lingayen Gulf, the task unit&#x27;s aircraft contingent provided an air screen for the invasion force as it transited towards north Luzon. During the latter half the transit, her aircraft screen began engaging aerial resistance, which increased as the fleet moved north. On 4 January, her sister was crippled by a kamikaze attack and subsequently scuttled. On 5 January, another sister, was damaged by a pair of two kamikazes, and on 8 January, yet another sister, was hit by a kamikaze, which forced two of her aircraft to land onboard &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;. The sinking of &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; resulted in &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; being transferred to Task Unit 77.4.2, the San Fabian Carrier Group under Rear Admiral Felix B. Stump. This meant that she would also have to assume some of her assigned duties, such as providing close air support for the landing U.S. forces. On 9 January, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; transferred one of her TBM-3 torpedo bombers to &quot;Manila Bay&quot; to help replace the seven torpedo bombers that &quot;Manila Bay&quot; had lost during her kamikaze attack.

On the late afternoon of 10 January, Task Unit 77.4.3 was proceeding behind and covering Task Force 79, the Lingayen Attack Force. At 18:06, a group of aircraft were spotted approaching the carriers from the southwest, at a distance of about . Eight fighters from &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; and four fighters from &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; were scrambled to meet this threat, and although half of the fighters missed their target, six fighters from &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; were able to intercept the kamikazes, downing many of them. However, two kamikazes were able to pass through the screen unmolested, making their way towards the two escort carriers. At 18:55, as darkness approached, the two planes began making their dives and were met by intense flak from the two carriers. One of the planes, apparently discouraged by the anti-aircraft fire, veered off, but the other plane, a Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot;, which first appeared to be headed towards &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;, plunged towards &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; instead, smashing into the latter&#x27;s port at the waterline at a high velocity, inflicting severe damage. Many of her aircraft that were already in the air were thus compelled to land onboard &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;, and Rear Admiral Ofstie was forced to transfer his flag to &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; as well.

After arriving on 8 January, until 17 January, when the escort carriers left Lingayen Gulf, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;, aside from providing an air screen against kamikazes, also conducted flight operations in close support of the ground invasion. 571 sorties were logged by Composite Squadron 94, 180 of which were flown over Luzon. On 17 January, she joined Task Group 77.14 and sailed for Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands, where she joined Task Unit 50.8.25, which was assigned to provide air cover for Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group, which provided replacement aircraft, supplies, and replacement personnel to the Fast Carrier Task Force. On 16 February, she departed Ulithi, and she arrived off of Iwo Jima, along with the replenishment carriers, on 19 February, just as the first landings were taking place. Assigned to group Baker of the Logistics Support Group, she, along with was responsible for providing air cover for the aircraft deliveries of , , , and .

On 5 March, she returned to Ulithi in preparation for the planned landings on Okinawa Island. On 13 March, she steamed for the Ryukyu Islands as a part of Task Unit 50.8.13, with the s and providing a physical screen for &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;. As with the Invasion of Iwo Jima, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; provided air cover for the Logistics Support Group. She was detached from Task Group 50.8 on 7 April, shortly after the main landings on Northern Okinawa, whereupon she joined Task Unit 52.1.1, trading places with . Shortly after being transferred, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; commenced close air support operations over Okinawa.
On 16 April, four of &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;″s FM-2 fighters were dispatched to help the , which was under heavy attack from kamikazes about north of Okinawa. The four fighters that &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; dispatched shot down six of the threatening kamikazes, but they were forced to withdraw due to the depletion of their fuel and ammunition. &quot;Laffey&quot; was later saved by the intervention of twelve Marine Corps Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers.

&quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; remained at station in support of the operations on Okinawa until 11 May, with only a few short interruptions to take on supplies and ammunition at Kerama Retto. During this period, on 20 April, Captain James Edward Leeper took over command of the vessel. On 11 May, she sailed for Guam in the Marianas Islands, and upon arriving, she took on munitions and supplies and her aircraft contingent was rotated, with Composite Squadron 94 rotating off, and Composite Squadron 96 rotating on. On 28 May, she departed Apra Harbor to return to duty off of Okinawa, this time as a part of Task Unit 32.1.1. Immediately after returning, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; rode out Typhoon Connie, but she suffered no serious damage. She continued flight operations until mid-June, when she headed for the Philippines. Over 1,200 sorties were logged by Composite Squadron 96 in support of the Okinawa campaign.
&quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; arrived within San Pedro Bay on 27 June, and in early July, she transferred some of her aircraft contingent to Guiuan Airfield. On 5 July, she sailed for Guam again, where she took on a load of aircraft engines, which were to be ferried to the United States for overhaul, and she arrived at San Diego on 27 July. There, the rest of Composite Squadron 96 was disembarked, and her crew began a period of availability that ended just before the Surrender of Japan was announced on 15 August.

===Post-war===
Following the end of the war, &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; first made a transport run to Guam, delivering aircraft to the island and then returning vehicles to the West Coast. Upon returning, she then joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She unloaded her unnecessary aviation stores and her aviation personnel at Naval Air Station Alameda, and on 20 October, she headed to Pearl Harbor to conduct her first &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; run, ferrying men of the 4th Marine Division back to the West Coast. She finished that run at San Diego on 2 November, and then made two transpacific &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; runs, one to Okinawa, and another to Honshu. She finished her third run at Seattle, Washington on 26 January 1946, whereupon she was released from the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet. She proceeded southwards back to Alameda on 2 February, and on 7 February, she steamed for the East Coast for inactivation work.

&quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; arrived at Boston on 1 March, where she underwent overhaul, and she was subsequently decommissioned and mothballed on 6 July 1946, joining the Boston group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, mooring at the South Boston Naval Annex. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, receiving the hull symbol CVU-84. She was struck from the Navy list on 27 June 1958, and in May 1958, she was sold for scrapping to the Hyman-Michaels Co., of Chicago. She was ultimately broken up in Hong Kong during November 1959. &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="554046" wikidata="Q7874108" url="?curid=554046" title="USS Shipley Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Shipley Bay&quot; (CVE-85) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after Shipley Bay, located within Kosciusko Island. The bay in turn was named after Ensign John H. Shipley, an officer on the ship surveying the Alexander Archipelago. Launched in February 1944, and commissioned in March 1944, she served in support of the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in October 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Shipley Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 22 November 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1122, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named &quot;Shipley Bay&quot;, which in turn was named after Ensign John H. Shipley, who assisted in surveying the Alexander Archipelago. Her naming was part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 12 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Lawrence B. Richardson; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 21 March 1944, with Captain Edgar Tilghman Neale in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Shipley Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She operated off the Southern California coast until 3 May, when she took on a load of aircraft and personnel, and ferried them to Pearl Harbor and stops in the South Pacific. She conducted these transport missions until October, making stops at the West Coast, Pearl Harbor, Majuro Atoll, Guadalcanal, and Tulagi. In these missions, she ferried a total of 496 aircraft.

After finishing her aircraft deliveries, she was designated the role of a replacement carrier, carrying aircraft to replenish battlefield losses. She was assigned to Task Group 30.8 within Task Force 38, and maintained a backline, supply role. In three meetings, she transferred a total of 100 aircraft to frontline carriers. The first rendezvous was conducted between 17 October and 29 October east of Samar, as she provided replacement aircraft for the desperate Battle off Samar. Her second transfer occurred east of Luzon, between 10 December and 24 December, as landings and close air support began being conducted for the ongoing Battle of Luzon. Her third and final transfer happened between 26 December 1944 and 12 January 1945 whilst &quot;Shipley Bay&quot; was northwest of Luzon, as an armada of carriers supported the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf.

After finishing her duties as a replacement carrier for the Philippines campaign, she operated off of Pearl Harbor as a training carrier for the next three months. During her tenure as a replacement carrier, Captain Austin Wadsworth Wheelock took over as commanding officer of the ship. On 22 April, she departed Pearl Harbor, bound for Okinawa. Stopping at Guam, she arrived on 7 May and immediately began operations. Between 7 May and 16 May, her aircraft conducted 352 sorties supporting the Battle of Okinawa, bombing Japanese defenses and equipment. On 16 May, her aviation gasoline tanks were damaged by a collision, forcing her to retire back to Guam for repairs.

Once repairs were finished, she once again returned to the waters off of Okinawa, along with five other escort carriers. She resumed operations on 9 June, and her aircraft were assigned the duty of neutralizing the five airfields on Miyako-jima and Ishigaki-jima, from which kamikaze aircraft were operating. She bombed the airfields between 14 and 16 June, returning again from 18 to 22 June. On 22 June, she left, bound for the West Coast, where she would undergo overhaul. She was moored at U.S. Repair Base, San Diego when the Japanese surrender was announced.

On 26 September, she left San Diego, and joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops at San Francisco, Pearl Harbor, Okinawa, and Kwajalein, ultimately returning several thousand troops back to the United States.

&quot;Shipley Bay&quot; sailed to Boston, Massachusetts in February 1946 in order to undergo deactivation, arriving on 9 March. She was decommissioned on 28 June 1946, and mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at South Boston Naval Annex. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-85. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and sold for scrap on 2 October. She was towed to Japan, where she was broken up throughout January 1961. She received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; (CVE-82) was a of the United States Navy. It was named after Saginaw Bay, located within Kuiu Island. The bay was in turn named after , a U.S. Navy sloop-of-war that spent 1868 and 1869 charting and exploring the Alaskan coast. Launched in January 1944, and commissioned in March, she served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Philippines campaign, the Invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in April 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in November 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20–mm cannons, and the amount of 40–mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 30 aircraft. However, during the Philippines campaign, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 19 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, and a TBM-3P reconnaissance aircraft, for a total of 31 aircraft.

==Construction==
A contract for fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers was made on 18 June 1942, with the construction being awarded to the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. All fifty were commissioned in the span of a single year. &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; was laid down on 1 November 1943 under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1119, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 19 January 1944, and was sponsored by Mrs. Howard L. Vickery. After construction was completed, the ship was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 2 March. Upon commissioning, &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; was under the command of Captain Frank Carlin Sutton Jr.

==Service history==
===World War II===
Upon being commissioned, she underwent a shakedown cruise off of San Diego. On 15 April 1944, &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; loaded aircraft and their pilots from Terminal Island for transport to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 April, where she unloaded her cargo in exchange for damaged planes, before returning to Alameda, California. She proceeded to conduct pilot qualifications off the coast of San Diego throughout May and early June, during which an FM-2 fighter crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After completing her exercises, she underwent a second replenishment aircraft ferry mission, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 5 July.

After taking on a load of aircraft, she proceeded westward to Enewetak Atoll and Majuro before returning to San Diego. On 13 August, she left, bound for the Solomon Islands, where she would act as the flagship for Carrier Division 28, commanded by Rear Admiral George R. Henderson. There, she prepared for the invasion of the Palaus. From 15 September to 9 October, her task group provided air cover over Peleliu and Anguar.

She retired to Seeadler Harbor, located within Manus Island, where plans were drawn for the landings on Leyte. She joined &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, along with 12 other escort carriers, under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague. &quot;Taffy 1&quot; was assigned the task of guarding the southeast entrance into Leyte Gulf. On 14 October, the task group departed, guarding troop transports along the way, arriving within Leyte Gulf by 20 October. As the Japanese Fleet closed in for a decisive engagement on 24 October, &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; and transferred much of their aircraft contingent to other carriers. She then retired to Morotai for replacement aircraft, missing the ensuing Battle off Samar. She rejoined her task unit on 28 October with a new aircraft contingent, just as it started to retire back to Manus.

&quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; was anchored in Seeadler Harbor on 10 November when the ammunition ship underwent a catastrophic explosion. She suffered only minor damage from the blast and resulting tidal wave. During her layover, she was taken into dry dock for repairs. From 14 December to the 21st, she underwent exercises in preparation for amphibious landings at Lingayen. On 2 January 1945, her task group departed Manus, escorting transports, arriving at Lingayen Gulf just in time to support the landings on 9 January. On 10 January, she came under attack from two Japanese bombers, who dropped bombs, which missed. On 14 January, a torpedo was spotted near her hull, which also missed. During this period of activity, was heavily damaged by a kamikaze, and was sunk by one, complicating the task group&#x27;s efforts to provide air support. Efforts were also hampered by heavy seas, which made landings on her flight deck precarious. On 21 January, she retired from supporting the landings, steaming back to Ulithi, in preparation for the landings upon Iwo Jima.

On 23 January, she participated in a rehearsal of the Iwo Jima landings in Ulithi. On 10 February, her task group departed Ulithi en route to Iwo Jima, making a stop at Saipan along the way. On 19 February, she supported the landings and provided air support until 11 March. During operations, the carrier task group was constantly harried by kamikazes. Her crew witnessed the escort carrier get hit by two kamikazes, before sinking from the resulting blaze. On 11 March, she departed from Iwo Jima bound for Ulithi, with Japanese forces still entrenched within the northern half of the island.

On 14 March, she arrived back at Ulithi, where Captain Robert Goldthwaite assumed command. &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot; was quickly returned into action, departing for Okinawa on 21 March, arriving on 24 March. There, she immediately began operations in preparation for the landings, which proceeded until 29 April. On 2 April, her anti-aircraft guns shot down a Japanese plane which dove towards her, while she was loading ammunition within Kerama Retto Harbor. Throughout the battle, her aircraft claimed eleven Japanese planes. On 29 April, she was ordered back to the United States, making stops at Guam, Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Francisco on 22 May, where she underwent repairs. After repairs were finished, she then proceeded down to San Diego, where she delivered planes to Guam, returning on 20 August. En route, the surrender of Japan was announced.

===Post war===
Following the end of the war, she steamed for Hawaii, where she underwent training operations before being incorporated into Operation Magic Carpet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. On 14 September, she departed Hawaii, making stops at Guiuan Roadstead, Samar, and San Pedro Bay, Leyte, where she took on servicemen. She then returned to San Francisco. She then made a second Magic Carpet run to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, before proceeding back for San Francisco.

On 1 February 1946, she was discharged from the Magic Carpet fleet, and departed San Francisco for Boston Naval Shipyard, on the Eastern seaboard. She arrived on 23 February for inactivation, and she was subsequently decommissioned on 19 June. She was assigned to the Boston Group of the U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 12 June 1955, she was reclassified as CVHE-82, but she was never converted. On 1 March 1959, she was struck from the navy list and sold to Louis Simmons on 27 November. In April 1960, she was broken up in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

<text>USS &quot;Sargent Bay&quot; (CVE-83) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after Sargent Bay, located within Revillagigedo Island, and was built for service during World War II. Launched in January 1944, and commissioned in March 1944, she served in support of the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in July 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Sargent Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. For example, during the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters, 10 TBM-1C variant torpedo bombers, and 3 TBM-3 variant torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Didrickson Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The escort carrier was laid down on 8 November 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1120, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 31 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Edith W. DeBaun; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 March 1944, with Captain William Theodore Rassieur in command.

==Service history==
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Sargent Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She then underwent a transport mission, ferrying P-47 Thunderbolts of the 333rd Fighter Squadron, 318th Fighter Group to Saipan. She unloaded her cargo on 18 July, and reported to the 3rd Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 17 August. The next day, she departed, bound for Eniwetok and Manus Island. On 6 November, she left Manus, assigned to Task Group 30.8 (Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group) on the first of four tours with replenishment groups operating off the Philippines. She provided air cover and support for the vulnerable oilers which supplied the frontline fast carrier groups with fuel and replacement aircraft, enabling them to operate out at sea for long periods of time. During this time period, &quot;Sargent Bay&quot; was based out of Ulithi. She remained on this duty until 27 January 1945, staying out at sea in two to four week increments.

In February 1945, &quot;Sargent Bay&quot; was assigned to Task Group 52.2, the escort carrier group responsible for providing air cover in preparation for the Invasion of Iwo Jima. Along five other carriers, she operated under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, in Carrier Division 26. Her air contingent provided artillery spotting and close air support for the marines struggling through the island, and she also conducted aircraft screening for the task group, as well as anti-submarine patrols. She continued operations until 11 March, when she retired along with her task group.

&quot;Sargent Bay&quot; was only out of action for a short period of time, as she joined Task Group 52.1.1, the escort carrier force assigned to support the planned Battle of Okinawa. Under the command of Rear Admiral Felix Stump, she began operations off of Okinawa on 25 March. She provided many of the same duties as she did during the Invasion of Iwo Jima, including conducting anti-aircraft patrols. Notably, on the late evening of 3 April, her fighters shot down one of a pair of kamikazes attempting to approach the escort carriers. Anti-aircraft fire from the destroyer brought down the other kamikaze. On 7 April, she traded places with the escort carrier , as she briefly left to join the Logistics Support Group, before returning to the strike force on 18 April. She left again on 15 May, for repairs at Guam. She rejoined operations over Okinawa on 2 June, before finally retiring from the operation on 20 June.

Proceeding south, she arrived off of Leyte on 23 June, and spent the next month performing upkeep. She then sailed for the United States, arriving at San Pedro on 9 August for repairs and overhaul. There, news of the Japanese surrender broke. After completing overhaul, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. During the month of October, she made two runs, transporting personnel from Hawaii. She then conducted a run to Eniwetok, and a final run to Okinawa, finishing her duties before the New Year.

Passing through the Panama Canal, &quot;Sargent Bay&quot; arrived at Boston on 23 March 1946 for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 23 June, and subsequently stored at the South Boston Naval Annex, where she was mothballed as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CVU-83 on 12 June 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 27 June 1958, and she was sold on 30 July 1959 to J.C. Berkwitt Co., New York. She was ultimately broken up in Antwerp, Belgium, starting September 1959.

<doc id="554052" wikidata="Q885100" url="?curid=554052" title="Blood Brothers (musical)">
<text>Blood Brothers is a musical with book, lyrics, and music by Willy Russell and was produced by Bill Kenwright until his death in 2023. The story is a contemporary nature versus nurture plot, revolving around fraternal twins Mickey and Eddie, who were separated at birth, one subsequently being raised in a wealthy family, the other in a poor family. The different environments take the twins to opposite ends of the social spectrum, one becoming a councillor, and the other unemployed and in prison. They both fall in love with the same girl, causing a rift in their friendship and leading to the tragic death of both brothers. Russell says that his work was based on a one-act play that he read as a child &quot;about two babies switched at birth ... it became the seed for Blood Brothers.&quot;

Originally developed as a high school play in Liverpool, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; debuted in Liverpool before Russell transferred it to the West End for a short run in 1983. The musical won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical and went on to a year-long national tour before returning for a revival in the West End in 1988 where it stayed at the Albery Theatre for 3 years, transferring to the Phoenix Theatre in 1991. The revival ran for more than 24 years in the West End, and played more than 10,000 performances, becoming the third longest-running musical production in West End history. It finally closed in November 2012. The musical has been produced with success on tour, on Broadway and elsewhere, and it has developed a cult following. &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; is often taught as one of the prescribed plays of GCSE English Literature in English schools.

==Plot==
===Act One===
The play opens in the early 1980s, at the ending of the story. Mrs. Johnstone, surrounded by others, including Mr. and Mrs. Lyons, and the Narrator, is standing over the bodies of Mickey and Eddie and sings “Tell Me It’s Not True” (“Overture”). The Narrator introduces the “story of the Johnstone twins” to the audience and the play then flashes back to the late 1950s.

30-year old Mrs. Johnstone lives in the Victorian inner-city slums of Liverpool. She describes her whirlwind romance with her husband, who, once attracted to her because of how she looked &quot;like Marilyn Monroe,&quot; lost interest in her after multiple pregnancies and weight gain, and eventually left her for a younger, more attractive woman. Now a single mother, she discovers she&#x27;s pregnant yet again (&quot;Marilyn Monroe&quot;).

Heavily in debt and unable to support her seven children alone, Mrs. Johnstone takes a job as a cleaner for a local upper-middle-class couple, Richard and Jennifer Lyons. While talking with Mrs. Lyons, she mentions she&#x27;s found out she&#x27;s carrying twins, but can only afford to raise one more child. Mrs. Lyons, desperate for a baby but unable to conceive, suggests she give one of the babies to her (&quot;My Child&quot;). Mrs. Johnstone reluctantly agrees and is made to swear on the Bible to keep to the deal.

Mrs. Johnstone has the twins, and names the two children Michael (known as Mickey throughout the play) and Edward, but then regrets having agreed to give one away (&quot;Easy Terms&quot;). After keeping her deal with Mrs. Lyons, she returns home with baby Michael and lies to her older children, saying that the other baby died.
Mrs. Johnstone continues to work for the Lyons family, but Mrs. Lyons begins to feels she&#x27;s too attached to Edward. She fires her, causing Mrs. Johnstone to demand her son back. Mrs. Lyons manipulates her into backing down by playing on her superstitious nature, telling her that &quot;if twins separated at birth learn that they were once one of a pair, they will both immediately die&quot; (&quot;Shoes Upon the Table&quot;).
Years later, a seven-year-old Mickey meets Edward by chance. After learning that they share the same birthday, the two boys make a pact to become blood brothers, with Mickey nicknaming Edward &quot;Eddie.&quot; Mrs. Johnstone finds them and sends Eddie away, fearing they&#x27;ll find out they&#x27;re twins. Later in the day, Mickey goes to Eddie&#x27;s house, but Mrs. Lyons throws him out when she realizes that he&#x27;s Edward&#x27;s twin.
Mickey plays with some neighbourhood children, including his friend Linda (&quot;Kids&#x27; Game&quot;). Afterwards, Mickey takes her to see Eddie, and the three of them sneak off to play. Mrs. Lyons worries about Eddie&#x27;s whereabouts (&quot;Gypsies in the Wood&quot;). The three are caught attempting to throw stones through a window by a police officer, and escorted home.

Mrs. Lyons, worried about Eddie&#x27;s friendship with Mickey, persuades her husband they should move. Eddie goes to Mrs. Johnstone&#x27;s house to say goodbye to Mickey and she gives him a locket, which she claims contains a picture of herself and Mickey. Edward asks Mrs. Johnstone why she doesn&#x27;t simply move away, causing her to dream about the seemingly impossible possibility of her moving away and beginning a new life (&quot;Bright New Day (Preview)&quot;). Mickey goes to visit Eddie but finds him gone (&quot;Long Sunday Afternoon / My Friend&quot;).
During the early 1970s, the Johnstone family are moved from the condemned inner-city slums of Liverpool to a new council house in the nearby overspill town of Skelmersdale (&quot;Bright New Day&quot;).

===Act Two===
Act Two rejoins the twins when they are 14 years old, some time in the early-to-mid 1970s. The Johnstone family are enjoying a better life now they have moved to a new home and a new area, and they have not seen Eddie in all this time (&quot;Marilyn Monroe 2&quot;). Mickey has now developed a crush on Linda, who is obviously interested in him too, but Mickey does not know how to approach her and is embarrassed by her honesty to being attracted to him. During their journey to school Sammy, Mickey&#x27;s older brother, pretends to be 14 to get a cheaper bus ticket. When he is confronted his violent nature becomes obvious; he swears violently at the driver, threatens him with a knife, steals some money and escapes.

Eddie is suspended from his boarding school for refusing to give up his locket to a teacher. Meanwhile, Mickey refuses to pay attention or co-operate during a class in his school, insulting the teacher, and is suspended. Linda is also suspended for defending him. When he returns home, Eddie refuses to tell Mrs. Lyons about the locket&#x27;s contents, and when she takes it and sees the picture inside she panics, and immediately assumes it is a picture of Eddie. She grows paranoid, having once thought she had buried the past by moving away, and questions Mrs. Johnstone&#x27;s presence in their lives (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Got Your Number&quot;). Eddie and Mickey, now teenage and insecure, both reminisce over their blood brother status, and after seeing each other but not realising they are seeing their blood brother, think about how they wish they had the qualities the other guy has (&quot;That Guy&quot;). After Mickey and Linda walk through a field in the countryside surrounding Skelmersdale, where Linda expresses her frustration at how Mickey has not yet asked her out, Mickey and Eddie meet by chance once again, revealing that the Lyons family moved close to Skelmersdale (where the Johnstone family now live) and they discover that they live near each other. Eddie gives Mickey humorously inexperienced advice on how to talk to Linda, and invites him to watch a pornographic film with him to &quot;see how it&#x27;s done&quot;.

An increasingly mentally deranged and paranoid Mrs. Lyons further questions whether she is truly free from Mrs. Johnstone (&quot;Shoes Upon The Table (Reprise)&quot;) as Mickey asks his mother for money to see a film while reintroducing Eddie. After she realises it is a pornographic film, the three have a humorous moment, before Mrs. Johnstone gives them the money and they leave. Mrs Lyons, by this point clearly mentally ill, discovers Mrs. Johnstone&#x27;s house and confronts her, believing that she followed her after they moved. After she admits that she “never made him [Eddie] mine”, she offers to pay off Mrs. Johnstone again. After Mrs. Johnstone stands her ground and declares she will not be paid off again, stating that she has made a good life for herself, an enraged Mrs. Lyons attempts to attack Mrs. Johnstone with a knife, but a now strong-willed Mrs. Johnstone fights back and kicks her out, with Mrs. Lyons fleeing in terror. Mrs. Lyons continues to deteriorate into insanity and it is implied that she has developed a reputation for madness. (“Mad Woman On A Hill”).

Mickey, Eddie, and Linda spend each summer as teens together, taking the play to the end of the 1970s, when an 18-year-old Eddie reveals to Linda that he is leaving for university in Liverpool the following day, but has not told her or Mickey. Linda reveals that Mickey still hasn&#x27;t asked her out, prompting Eddie to tell her what he would say to her if he were Mickey. Secretly, he is revealing his true feelings but has not acted on them out of respect for Mickey (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Saying A Word&quot;). Eddie leaves for university in Liverpool, but not before encouraging Mickey to ask Linda out.

During Eddie&#x27;s absence, Linda gets pregnant, and she and Mickey quickly marry and move in with Mrs Johnstone. Mickey is then made redundant from his factory job due to the recession of the early 1980s, which hits Merseyside particularly hard, and Mickey joins thousands of other Merseysiders on the dole shortly before Christmas (“Take A Letter, Miss Jones&quot;). Eddie returns at Christmas ready to party and have fun, but Mickey realises that they are now very different; after a small argument, they part. Mickey is persuaded to assist his brother Sammy, who now engages in criminal acts, in a robbery, to earn money to support Linda and their baby daughter Sarah. The robbery goes bad, and Mickey becomes an accessory to a murder committed by Sammy. He is sentenced to seven years in prison, and the incident destroys Mickey mentally.

In prison, Mickey is diagnosed as chronically depressed. When released early for good behaviour, he is still dependent on anti-depressants. He becomes withdrawn and turns away from Linda (&quot;Marilyn Monroe 3&quot;). Linda, unable to get Mickey off the anti-depressants, contacts Eddie, who is now a local councillor, who gets them their own house in Liverpool and Mickey a job (&quot;Light Romance&quot;), taking the focus of the play back to Liverpool. Linda worries about Mickey and continues to meet up with Eddie. A mentally ill Mrs. Lyons, now seemingly wanting to get back at Mrs. Johnstone in any way possible, even if it involves possibly being harmful to Eddie, sees Eddie and Linda together and tells Mickey about it, suggesting that the two are having an affair. Distraught over Eddie and Linda&#x27;s &#x27;affair,&#x27; Mickey grabs the gun that Sammy hid before he got arrested and storms down to the council offices to confront Eddie (&quot;Madman&quot;), who is giving a speech as Mickey storms in with the gun. Mickey asks why Eddie would take away the one good thing that Mickey had – Linda. Eddie denies this intention, and the police enter, demanding that Mickey put the gun down. After being informed by Linda of the incident, Mrs. Johnstone runs in and, in an attempt to stop Mickey from shooting Eddie, tells the two brothers the truth. Mickey furiously despairs that he was not the one given away, because then he could have had the life given to Eddie. Enraged, Mickey gestures with the gun toward Eddie and accidentally pulls the trigger. The gun fires, killing Eddie, with the police then shooting and killing Mickey.

As Mrs. Lyons had suggested all those years earlier, the superstition that the two brothers would die if they discovered the truth has finally materialised, and the narrator questions whether the differing backgrounds of the two boys was more to blame than superstition. (&quot;Tell Me It&#x27;s Not True&quot;).

=== Alternative ending ===
In another version, Mickey has a fake gun. Mrs. Johnstone rushes to stop him and reveals the truth, which provokes Mrs. Lyons to attempt to shoot Mickey in order to keep her own child. Eddie jumps in and takes the bullet, and Mrs. Lyons shoots Mickey in rage. This version ends with the narrator&#x27;s monologue. This alternative ending is very rare nowadays - only used for the Play

<doc id="554053" wikidata="Q7873903" url="?curid=554053" title="USS Savo Island">
<text>USS &quot;Savo Island&quot; (CVE-78) was the twenty-fourth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named to memorialize the U.S. casualties of the Battle of Savo Island, which was fought as part of the Guadalcanal campaign. The ship was launched in December 1943, commissioned in February 1944, and served as a frontline carrier throughout the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign. During the Battle of Okinawa, she provided air cover for the replenishment carrier fleet. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in December 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in February 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Savo Island&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, at the waterline, she was long, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft. During the Battle off Samar, she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft. During the Battle of Mindoro, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft. During the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 19 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 27 September 1943 under the name &quot;Kaita Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1115, the twenty-fourth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was renamed &quot;Savo Island&quot; on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. She was launched on 22 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Margaret Taffinder; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 3 February 1944, with Captain Clarence Eugene Ekstrom in command.

==Service history==
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Savo Island&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego, where she took on a load of replacement aircraft. Between 15 March 1944 and 2 July, she underwent two transport missions, ferrying aircraft to bases in the Southwest Pacific. On 6 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 27, which would be her aircraft contingent throughout the Marianas and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign of 1944–45. After a brief period of training off the waters of San Diego, she sailed west to Pearl Harbor, where similar exercises were conducted. There, on 4 August, she was assigned to Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group, commanded by Rear Admiral William Sample, of the Third Fleet, assigned to support the planned landings on the island of Peleliu, in the Palau Islands. Her aircraft contingent began combat operations on 11 September, strafing and bombarding the island to soften up the defenses for the landings. Following the landing of marines, her aircraft transitioned into providing close air support and patrol missions, up until 30 September.

On 3 October, she was assigned to and joined Task Group 77.4, which was gathering at Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, as part of the Seventh Fleet. She, accompanied by eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, steamed on 12 October for Leyte Gulf, where they were expected to support the landings on Leyte, which marked the beginning of the Philippines campaign. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2, otherwise known as &quot;Taffy 2&quot;, commanded by Rear Admiral Felix Stump, she was positioned to the direct south of &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, which was located to the direct east of the San Bernardino Strait. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the Sixth Army had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days.

On 23 October, the Battle of Leyte Gulf began. Almost the entirety of Japan&#x27;s remaining surface fleet had been concentrated into a counterattack against the U.S. forces in the vicinity of the Philippines, which had threatened to cut off Japan&#x27;s vital oil supply from Southeast Asia. Split into three groups, the Southern Force was defeated in the Battle of Surigao Strait, whilst Vice Admiral William Halsey Jr. sent the Third Fleet in an attack against the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, the escort carriers which continued providing ground support had no capital ship screening, even as Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force drove through the San Bernardino Strait during the night. On the early morning of 25 October, the Center Force emerged into the waters of Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some north of &quot;Savo Island&quot;, by surprise.

As the American command came to an understanding of the severity of the situation, with the Center Force consisting of four battleships, six cruisers, and a large destroyer screen, the entirety of Taffy 2&#x27;s aircraft were recalled to join the defense. &quot;Savo Island&quot;″s fighters and torpedo bombers were not equipped to attack surface ships, with most of her bombers being loaded with incendiary bombs and missiles for ground attacks. Nonetheless, aircraft from &quot;Savo Island&quot;″s VC-27 were amongst Taffy 2&#x27;s first wave of strikes, launched at 7:37 in the morning. Some of the destroyers within Taffy 2&#x27;s screen wandered north, before being confronted with some Japanese naval gunfire and being ordered to withdraw towards the escort carriers. Overall, &quot;Savo Island&quot; launched six strikes against the Japanese forces, with her aircraft notably landing a torpedo hit on a Japanese battleship and shooting down an Aichi E13A reconnaissance seaplane caught in the middle of the action.

Discouraged by the stiff resistance his Center Force had faced, including the loss of three cruisers, Kurita issued orders to withdraw in the late morning, sparing Taffy 3 from further destruction. As the Japanese forces withdrew, fighters from &quot;Savo Island&quot; took the opportunity to down four more Japanese planes. Nonetheless, the escort carriers underwent concentrated Japanese attack again in the afternoon, this time from the air, including some of the first usage of kamikaze suicide attacks. The carrier continued supporting ground operations until 30 October, when Taffy 2 was reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, and ordered to withdraw back to Manus Island to rearm and replenish. She sortied from Manus on 19 November, providing cover for convoys proceeding to Leyte Gulf from 22 November to 27 November, accompanied by two other escort carriers. Upon completing this task, she replenished at Kossol Roads, Palau, before she left on 10 December, this time in support of the landings on the island of Mindoro. Her aircraft provided air cover as the landing craft unloaded their troops, and provided close air support as they advanced. They also targeted air fields, from which kamikaze aircraft were beginning to make regular forays. The escort carriers were relieved by Army aircraft on 15 December, but she stayed offshore until 17 December because of indications of a Japanese surface raid, which never materialized. On 17 December, she steamed back to Manus Island.
At Manus Island, &quot;Savo Island&quot; was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.2., the San Fabian Carrier Group. On 27 December, the carriers, escorted by a large surface fleet, left Manus bound for Lingayen Gulf, to the west of Luzon. There, the carriers would support the 6th Army landings on Luzon. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2., &quot;Savo Island&quot; would provide air support and cover for the I Army Corps, which would land around the San Fabian area. Pausing at San Pedro Bay, the carriers entered the Sulu Sea on 3 January 1945, where they began being harried by aircraft, circling around on radar. Japanese planes continued appearing around the periphery of the American forces throughout 4 January, but it was not until 17:00 in the evening that the Japanese forces coalesced into a kamikaze strike, attacking at 17:12, achieving complete surprise, and sinking &quot;Savo Island&quot;″s sister .

The following day, on 5 January, the kamikazes returned. At 17:43 in the evening, the battleship reported planes approaching from her starboard bow, and shortly afterwards, &quot;Savo Island&quot;″s sister had been hit by two kamikazes, heavily damaging the ship. A few minutes after the attack on &quot;Manila Bay&quot;, a Nakajima Ki-43 kamikaze dove towards &quot;Savo Island&quot;. Engaged by several anti-aircraft batteries, the plane began trailing smoke some away from the carrier. As a reaction, &quot;Savo Island&quot; turned hard to starboard, whilst its searchlight was pointed at the aircraft to try to blind the pilot. The plane, moving erratically, passed between the carrier&#x27;s mast and the whip antenna, shearing off the carrier&#x27;s radar antenna, before diving into the sea.

On 6 January, the carriers proceeded into Lingayen Gulf, and started a heavy bombardment of Japanese defenses, flying 5,971 sorties in eleven days. On 9 January, the 6th Army moved onshore, encountering little resistance. &quot;Savo Island&quot; remained on station until 17 January, when the United States Air Force took over air operations on Luzon. She then proceeded south to operate to the northwest of Mindoro, to guard against any counterattacks on the American garrisons situated throughout the Northern Philippines, staying on station from 17 January until 29 January. During this period, on 19 January, Captain William Donald Anderson took command of the ship. Upon completing her patrols, she then provided cover for landings near Subic Bay on 29 and 30 January, before retiring to Ulithi, in the Caroline Islands, for repairs and replenishment. There, her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 27, was replaced with Composite Squadron 91, which had previously served upon &quot;Savo Island&quot;″s sister . Upon receiving replacement pilots, she began a brief period of training exercises, before being assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, in preparation for the Battle of Okinawa.

Transiting via Leyte, her aircraft provided air cover and patrols en route. On 26 March, along with two other escort carriers, she supported the 77th Infantry Division as it occupied the Kerama Islands. On 27 March, she began bombing the main island of Okinawa, with her fighters flying antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 7 April, the carrier left Task Unit 52.1.1., trading places with , part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group. Therefore, from 7 to 16 April, she screened a replenishment convoy proceeding to the east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of that task, she continued providing close air support for American forces advancing down Okinawa. On 27 April, her aircraft bombed Sakishima Gunto, an island situated halfway between Okinawa and Formosa. On 29 April, &quot;Savo Island&quot;, along with her sisters and , were discharged from their task group, all sailing for overhaul in San Diego. &quot;Savo Island&quot;″s aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 91, was traded for her sister &#x27;s Composite Squadron (VC) 84.

After finishing overhaul, &quot;Savo Island&quot; began a transport mission from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, before transiting back to Alameda, California, on the West Coast. On 6 August, she departed for the Aleutian Islands, arriving on 15 August, right as the Surrender of Japan was announced. On 31 August, she headed, along with six other escort carriers, to support the occupation of Japan in northern Honshū and Hokkaidō. After finishing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, where she was assigned to the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She first loaded occupation troops bound for Japan at San Francisco, before heading west. &quot;Savo Island&quot; made a total of three &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; voyages, repatriating troops from Guam, Pearl Harbor, and Okinawa, respectively. Upon arriving at Seattle on 14 January 1946, and finishing her final voyage, she transited to the Eastern seaboard, entering Boston Harbor on 16 March for inactivation.

&quot;Savo Island&quot; was decommissioned on 12 December, and mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, as part of its Boston group. Docked at the South Boston Naval Annex, she was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier (CVHE-78) on 12 June 1955. She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport (AKV-28) on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1959, and she was sold on 29 February 1960 to Comarket Inc., which broke her up in Hong Kong throughout June 1960. &quot;Savo Island&quot; received 4 battle stars for her World War II service. In addition, she received a Presidential Unit Citation for her service in the Western Carolines, the Philippines, and Okinawa from 6 September 1944 to 29 April 1945.
Clarence Ekstrom, the carrier&#x27;s commander during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, later received the Navy Cross for his leadership and courage in the action.

==In popular culture==
While the &quot;Savo Island&quot; spent the Korean War in mothballs as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, author James Michener fictionally had it in commission (as an Essex-class fleet carrier) and participating in that war as the primary setting for his novella &quot;The Bridges at Toko-ri&quot;. The 1954 movie version was filmed aboard the fleet carriers and with &quot;Oriskany&quot; still displaying its hull symbol of CV-34, but the ship was still referred to as the &quot;Savo Island&quot;.

<text>Priority [[traffic sign]]s indicate the order in which vehicles shall pass intersection points. Vehicles often come into conflict with other vehicles and pedestrians because their intended courses of travel intersect, and thus interfere with each other&#x27;s routes. The general principle that establishes who has the right to go first is called &quot;right of way&quot; or &quot;priority&quot;. It establishes who has the right to use the conflicting part of the road and who has to wait until the other does so. The vehicle that does not need to wait is said to &quot;have the right of way&quot; or to &quot;have priority.&quot;

== Types of sign ==


A Give way sign, also known as a yield sign in some countries, informs the driver that they must give way to vehicles on the major road. Under the Vienna Convention, the standard sign shall be a white or yellow inverted triangle with a red border. This originates in Denmark, with the red and white coming from the Danish flag. In some countries, the words &quot;Give Way&quot; or equivalent may be included with the sign. These signs are usually accompanied by a give way marking, normally one or multiple dashed lines or shark teeth across the carriageway.

<text>The school run is the modern practice of parents taking their children to school by car. Many parents park their cars in school car parks and driveways to drop off and pick up their children at the appropriate times.

== Background ==
In the past it was normal for children to walk to school, either on their own, with friends, or accompanied by an adult. Walking to school by primary school pupils in the UK fell from 61% in 1992/4 to 50% in 2004. In recent years walking to school has become less common as more and more students are dropped off at school by parents using cars, sometimes in a rota with other parents.

Reasons for this trend include:

*In many cases both parents work and do not have time to walk their children to school, and do not know any other parents who have the time either.
*Even if the children are old enough to walk on their own (or cycle), most parents are worried that something may happen to them, such as kidnapping or a car accident, partly due to media coverage of isolated cases.
*Often there is no convenient bus service, and the distance is too far for walking

The risk of children being run over near their schools is much higher than in the past due to parents driving their own children to school and parking in unsafe places near the school gates. It is not unusual to see drivers parking their cars in bus stops, on pedestrian crossings or facing the wrong way, with children getting in or out of the car.

== Problems arising from &#x27;the school run&#x27; ==

Some streets near schools now have a 20 mph (32 km/h) speed limit operating when the children are about, though traffic congestion often necessitates a lower speed.

With the increase in a choice of schools, children may have to travel further and are more likely to require a bus or car ride.

It is claimed that the school run is responsible for a large amount of the traffic problems in the morning rush hour.

The decreasing amount of exercise and associated increase in obesity are also partly blamed on the school run. To combat this, many schools have started arrangements to encourage children to walk to school, whilst mitigating the possible dangers. An example is the &quot;walking school bus&quot;, an organised group of children and volunteer parents walking to school.

The school run has become a popular target for some politicians and campaigners against the use of cars for journeys which could be better walked or cycled. One of the campaigns promoting this alternative is the walk to school campaign.

Some schools are now designed with winding drop-off lanes to accommodate long queues of private vehicles, making it more difficult to access the school by bike or foot.

<text>Texas Stadium was an American football stadium located in Irving, Texas, a suburb west of Dallas. Opened on October 24, 1971, it was known for its distinctive hole in the roof, the result of abandoned plans to construct a retractable roof.

The stadium was the home field of the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys for 38 seasons, through 2008, and had a seating capacity of 65,675. In 2009, the Cowboys moved to Cowboys Stadium (now AT&amp;T Stadium) in nearby Arlington.

Texas Stadium was demolished on April 11, 2010, by a controlled implosion.

==History==

The Cowboys had played at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas since their inception in 1960. However, by the mid-1960s, founding owner Clint Murchison, Jr., felt that the Fair Park area of the city had become unsafe and downtrodden, and did not want his season ticket holders to be forced to go through it. Murchison was denied a request by mayor Erik Jonsson to build a new stadium in downtown Dallas as part of a municipal bond package.

Murchison envisioned a new stadium with sky boxes and one in which attendees would have to pay a personal seat license as a prerequisite to purchasing season tickets. With two games left for the Cowboys to play in the 1967 season, Murchison and Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm announced a plan to build a new stadium in the northwest suburb of Irving.

Texas Stadium, along with Schaefer Stadium (1971), Arrowhead Stadium (1972), Rich Stadium (1973), and the Pontiac Silverdome (1975), was part of a new wave of football-only stadiums (all with artificial turf) built following the AFL–NFL merger. More so than its contemporaries, Texas Stadium featured a proliferation of luxury boxes, which provided the team with a large new income source exempt from league revenue sharing.

It hosted its first Cowboys game on October 24, 1971, a 44–21 victory over the New England Patriots, and became an icon of the Cowboys with their rise in national prominence. The Cowboys entered the season as defending NFC champions and won their first world title in Super Bowl VI in January 1972. The field was surrounded by a blue wall emblazoned with white stars, a design replicated in its successor, AT&amp;T Stadium.

Texas Stadium&#x27;s field alignment (between the goal posts) was southwest-to-northeast, perpendicular to the Cotton Bowl, which is southeast-to-northwest.

===Roof===
The most distinctive element of Texas Stadium was its partial roof, the only one in the NFL. The roof was originally supposed to be the first retractable roof in the NFL. However, it was discovered that the structure could not support the additional weight. This resulted in a partial roof that covered most of the stands but not the playing field itself. Cowboys linebacker D. D. Lewis once famously said that &quot;Texas Stadium has a hole in its roof, so God can watch His favorite team play&quot;.

The open roof allowed snow to cover the field in the Thanksgiving Day game against the Miami Dolphins in 1993. The unusual roof also introduced a unique difficulty in televising games, as sunlight would cover part of the field and make it hard for TV cameras to adjust for the changes in light.

The roof was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the city of Irving, the stadium&#x27;s owners. It was the first time the roof had been repainted since Texas Stadium opened.

===Other events===
Football

Texas Stadium hosted five NFC Championship Games. The 1973 Pro Bowl was held at Texas Stadium in front of 47,879 spectators.

The first football game played at Texas Stadium was on October 15, 1971, when Texas Southern defeated 34–21 in a college football game. The stadium hosted numerous neutral-site college football games and was the home field of the SMU Mustangs for eight seasons, from 1979 through 1986. After the school returned from an NCAA-imposed suspension in 1988, school officials moved games back to the school&#x27;s on-campus Ownby Stadium to signify a clean start for the football program (since replaced by Gerald J. Ford Stadium in 2000). The 2001 Big 12 Championship Game was held at the site.

In November and December, Texas Stadium was a major venue for high school football. It was not uncommon for there to be high school football tripleheaders at the stadium. Texas Stadium served as a temporary home for two Dallas-area high schools, Plano Senior High School in 1979 after its home stadium was damaged by a prank gone awry , and Highland Park High School while a new stadium on campus was being built.

The stadium has also played host to the two largest capacity crowds for Texas high school football playoff games. In 1977, Plano defeated Port Neches-Groves 13-10 in front of a record crowd of 49,953. In 2006, the matchup between Trinity High School from Euless, and Carroll Senior High School from Southlake, in the second round of the playoffs, ended in a 22-21 Southlake victory (on their way to a fourth 5A state championship in five years) before an announced crowd of 46,339 at Texas Stadium. These games marked two of the top three all-time attendance figures for a Texas high school football game and the stadium recorded three of the top 20 attendance records.

In 1988, Texas Stadium hosted the Class 5A championship game, where Dallas Carter, led by future New York Giants Pro Bowl linebacker Jessie Armstead, defeated Converse Judson 31-14. The University Interscholastic League later stripped Carter of its title due to numerous rule violations. Carter advanced to the final by defeating Odessa Permian 14-9 in the semifinals at Memorial Stadium in Austin in a game highlighted by the book &quot;Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream&quot; and its film adaptation. 

In 1994, the stadium hosted the John Tyler vs. Plano East high school football regional playoff, whose wild seesaw finish won it the 1995 Showstopper of the Year ESPY Award.

Soccer

In addition to American football, the Dallas Tornado of the NASL used it as their home stadium from 1972 to 1975 and again from 1980 to 1981 when the team folded.

On November 21, 1991, the U.S. Men&#x27;s National soccer Team played a friendly match against Costa Rica.

Supercross

Texas Stadium hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship from 1975 to 1977 and 1983 to 2008.

Bull riding

The Professional Bull Riders (PBR) held a Bud Light Cup event at Texas Stadium known as the &quot;Battle of the Bulls&quot; during the organization&#x27;s first two years of existence (1994 &amp; 1995). In both instances, the event was won by three-time PBR world champion Adriano Morães (in 1994 he was the co-champion along with Pat Yancey). The 1995 event was also notable because of rain which turned the dirt into mud, affecting the performance of several bulls.

Lacrosse

On May 25, 2008, Texas Stadium hosted the first ever professional lacrosse game in Texas when the two-time defending Major League Lacrosse champions Philadelphia Barrage played the Long Island Lizards. The Barrage disbanded after the 2008 season while the re-named New York Lizards remained as a member of MLL&#x27;s Eastern Conference until 2020 when the MLL merged with the Premier Lacrosse League.

Professional wrestling 

From 1984 to 1988, the stadium hosted the annual World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) David Von Erich &quot;Memorial Parade of Champions&quot; professional wrestling card every May. The initial 1984 card drew more than 40,000 fans, the highest attendance of any wrestling card in the state of Texas at that time.

Religious gatherings

The stadium hosted religious gatherings such as Promise Keepers and Billy Graham crusades; a Graham crusade was the first event held at Texas Stadium.

From October 17 to October 20, 2002, evangelist Billy Graham held the Metroplex Mission crusade in Texas Stadium. Several Christian musical groups also played during the event. Former president George H. W. Bush gave an introduction for Graham on the first night of the crusade.

===Concerts===
===In television===
The stadium appeared in numerous episodes of the television series, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993–2001), which was filmed in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

The stadium appeared in the 1999 movie &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; being the home of the &quot;Dallas Knights&quot; in the film.

The stadium has also appeared in the season one finale of &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; As a setting for the State Championship game between the Dillon Panthers and the West Cambria Mustangs.

Throughout the network run of the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, a number of scenes were filmed on location at Texas Stadium. An overhead shot of the stadium (looking down at the field from the hole in the roof) was also featured prominently as part of the show&#x27;s opening credits for each of its thirteen seasons on CBS. This trend has continued with the new series with AT&amp;T Stadium taking its place.

===Seating capacity===
===The Cowboys&#x27; departure===
When opened, the stadium had many amenities that included 381 luxury suites, a stadium club where fans gathered for parties and banquets, and The Corral that provided food, beverages, entertainment and large screen televisions. However, by the 2000s other NFL teams received new stadiums that had more club and luxury seating than Texas Stadium had, so the Dallas Cowboys asked for a new stadium.

The Cowboys left Texas Stadium after the 2008 NFL season for Cowboys Stadium (opened for the 2009 NFL season) that was partially funded by taxpayers in Arlington. In November 2004, Arlington voters approved a half-cent (.005 per U.S. dollar) sales tax to fund $325 million of the then estimated $650 million stadium by a margin of 55%-45%. Jerry Jones, the Cowboys&#x27; owner, spent over $5 million backing the ballot measure, but also agreed to cover any cost overruns which as of 2006 had already raised the estimated cost of the project to $1 billion.

AT&amp;T Stadium, which has a retractable roof system, also includes a setting that mimics a hole in the roof as a tribute to Texas Stadium.

The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the Baltimore Ravens, 33–24, on December 20, 2008.

====Closure====
The stadium was scheduled for demolition and implosion on April 11, 2010, as confirmed by the mayor of Irving on September 23, 2009.

Many of the items in the stadium were auctioned off by the city and the Dallas Cowboys including the stadium seats, scoreboard and other pieces of memorabilia.

The City of Irving announced that the Texas Department of Transportation would pay $15.4 million to lease the site for 10 years for use as a staging location for the State Highway 114/Loop 12 diamond interchange. The city has the right to relocate the staging area if redevelopment becomes available.

====Demolition====
On September 23, 2009, the City of Irving granted a demolition contract to Weir Brothers Inc., a local Dallas based company, for the demolition and implosion of the stadium.

On December 31, 2009, The City of Irving and Kraft Foods announced details of their sponsorship deal for the stadium&#x27;s implosion — including a national essay contest with the winner getting to pull the trigger that finishes off the stadium. Kraft paid the city $75,000 and donated $75,000 worth of food to local food banks to promote its &quot;Cheddar Explosion&quot; version of Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. The city council unanimously approved the sponsorship deal.

At 7:07 a.m. CDT on April 11, 2010, 11-year-old Casey Rogers turned the key to cause the demolition. From the first explosion, it took approximately 25 seconds for the stadium to completely fall. Debris removal continued until July 2010. Texas&#x27;s Department of Transportation is using the site as an equipment storage and staging area, after which Irving will decide long-term plans.

In 2013–15, the area around the former stadium has been the epicenter for at least 46 small earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 1.6 to 3.6.

<text>Sahibzada Mohammad Shahid Khan Afridi (, ; born 1 March 1977) is a Pakistani former cricketer and captain of the Pakistan national cricket team. An all-rounder, Afridi was a right-handed leg spinner and a right-handed batsman.

Afridi made his ODI debut in 1996 against Kenya. In his second ODI match against Sri Lanka, he played his first international innings and broke the record for fastest century in ODI cricket (doing so in 37 deliveries). He made his Test debut against Australia in 1998. Afridi made his T20I debut against England in 2006. Afridi was named player of the tournament of the 2007 T20 World Cup. Afridi was player of the match in the final of the 2009 T20 World Cup scoring an unbeaten 54 and getting figures of 1/20 off of 4 overs as Pakistan went on to win the final. Shortly after Pakistan&#x27;s win at the 2009 World Cup, Pakistan&#x27;s captain, Younis Khan, announced his retirement from T20Is and Afridi was appointed as his successor. In 2010, Afridi was appointed Pakistan&#x27;s ODI captain after the sacking of Mohammad Yousuf. Afridi was also appointed Pakistan&#x27;s Test captain but retired from the format after one match as captain. He led the Pakistan team in the 2011 Cricket World Cup where they reached the semi-finals before losing to rival India. In 2011, Afridi was removed as ODI captain. In 2015, Afridi retired from ODI cricket. After Pakistan&#x27;s group stage elimination from the 2016 T20 World Cup, Afridi stepped down from captaincy. He was not selected afterwards and on 19 February 2017, Afridi announced his retirement from international cricket. He made a brief return to international cricket after being selected to represent and captain the World XI against the West Indies in the 2018 Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge charity match. Following the conclusion of the match, Afridi announced his retirement from international cricket again on 31 May 2018. He served as the interim chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team for Pakistan&#x27;s series against New Zealand.

Afridi runs his own charity, the Shahid Afridi Foundation which aims to provide education and healthcare facilities. He also teamed up with UNICEF to promote the anti-polio campaign in the country. During the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, he was involved in helping people across Balochistan during the lockdown in the country. This led to him contracting COVID-19 on 13 June 2020. Afridi was also nominated among the top 20 most charitable athletes of 2015.

== Early and personal life ==
Afridi was born in Khyber Agency, Pakistan, to an Afridi tribe of Pashtuns in 1977.

He belongs to a family of Sufi pirs (teachers or spiritual masters) and his grandfather Maulana Muhammad Ilyas was a well-known spiritual figure in Bhutan Sharif, a locality in the Tirah Valley. His other grandfather, Sahibzada Abdul Baqi, was given the title &quot;Ghazi-e-Kashmir&quot; (conqueror of Kashmir) for his efforts during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948.

Afridi has six brothers, including fellow cricketers Tariq Afridi and Ashfaq Afridi, and five sisters. He is the fifth oldest of his siblings. He credits his uncle, a colonel in the Pakistan Army, for introducing him to sports in general and to cricket in particular. Afridi has said that he was inspired by the stories about Imran Khan&#x27;s captaincy throughout the 1992 Cricket World Cup and that the 1992 World Cup defined his cricket and taught him to never be afraid of failure.

He is married to his maternal cousin Nadia Afridi and has five daughters. In 2021, Afridi announced his daughter Ansha&#x27;s engagement to cricketer Shaheen Afridi. On 3 February 2023, his daughter, Ansha, married Shaheen Afridi in a nikah ceremony.

== Domestic career ==
Afridi was drafted to the Pakistan senior national team after fine performances at the under-19 championship circuit starting the 1994–95 season. Playing for the Karachi Whites, he helped his team win the title the following season picking 42 wickets in five matches at an average of 9.59. Later that season, Afridi had played against the visiting England A and West Indies Youth teams and a few first-class games for Karachi Whites in the senior National Championship. In 2001, Afridi signed a contract to represent Leicestershire. In five first-class matches he scored 295 runs at an average of 42.14, including a highest score of 164, and took 11 wickets at an average of 46.45; Afridi also played 11 one day matches for the club, scoring 481 runs at an average of 40.08 and taking 18 wickets at 24.04. His highest score of 95 came from 58 balls in a semi-final of the C&amp;G Trophy to help Leicestershire beat Lancashire by seven wickets. Derbyshire County Cricket Club signed Afridi to play for them in the first two months of the 2003 English cricket season.

==== IPL career ====
Afridi was signed by Deccan Chargers, and played in the inaugural season of the IPL. He could only score 81 runs in 10 matches and picked up 9 wickets in the tournament. He did not play in the 2nd edition of IPL due to the tense atmosphere after the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

He was signed by Bangla Tigers for the 2021–22 T10 League.

== International career ==
=== Early years ===
In October 1996, Afridi was drafted into the ODI team during the four-nation Sameer Cup 1996–97 as a replacement for the injured Mushtaq Ahmed. He made his debut on 2 October against Kenya; however, he didn&#x27;t bat and went wicketless. In the next match against Sri Lanka, Afridi batted at number three in the role of a pinch-hitter. In his first international innings, Afridi broke the record for fastest century in ODI cricket, reaching his hundred from 37 balls. The eleven sixes he struck also equaled the record for most in an ODI innings. Pakistan posted a total of 371, at the time the second-highest in ODIs, and won by 82 runs; Afridi was named man of the match. The record for fastest century in ODI was broken by New Zealand cricketer Corey Anderson on 1 January 2014 who scored his century from 36 balls.

Two years after his international debut, Afridi made his Test debut in the third game of a three-match series against Australia on 22 October 1998. By this point he had already played 66 ODIs, at the time a record before playing Tests. He opened the batting, making scores of 10 and 6, and took five wickets in the first innings. He played his second Test the following January during Pakistan&#x27;s tour of India; it was the first Test between the two countries since 1990. Again opening the batting, Afridi scored his maiden Test century, scoring 141 runs from 191 balls. In the same match he also claimed three wickets for 54 runs. After winning the first match by 12 runs, Pakistan lost the second to draw the series.

=== Rise in significance ===
Afridi made his presence felt in the third Test against India in March 2005, scoring a quick-fire second-innings half-century and taking five wickets in the match (including Tendulkar twice) to help Pakistan to win the game and register a series draw. In April, Afridi struck what at the time was the equal second-fastest century in ODIs; he reached 100 off 45 deliveries against India, sharing the record with West Indian Brian Lara. Afridi was more consistent with his batting and bowling throughout 2005. Pakistan&#x27;s coach, Bob Woolmer, helped Afridi to reach a fuller potential by improving his shot selection and giving him free rein over his batting attitude.

On 21 November 2005, Shahid Afridi was banned for a Test match and two ODIs for deliberately damaging the pitch in the second match of the three-Test series against England. Television cameras pictured him scraping his boots on the pitch scuffing the surface when play was held up after a gas canister exploded. Afridi later pleaded guilty to a level three breach of the ICC code of conduct relating to the spirit of the game. Match referee Roshan Mahanama said: &quot;This ban should serve as a message to players that this type of behaviour is not allowed.&quot;

On 12 April 2006, Afridi announced a temporary retirement from Test cricket so that he could concentrate on ODIs, with a particular focus on the 2007 World Cup, and to spend more time with his family. He said he would consider reversing his decision after the World Cup. Afridi had played ten Tests since being recalled to the side in January 2005, averaging 47.44 with the bat including four centuries. However, on 27 April he reversed his decision, saying that &quot;[Woolmer] told me that I am one of the main players in the team and squad and that Pakistan really needed me&quot;. Before Pakistan toured England in July to September, Afridi played for Ireland as an overseas player in the C&amp;G Trophy. In six matches, he scored 128 runs and took seven wickets. England won the four-match Test series 3–0; Afridi played two matches, scoring 49 runs and took three wickets. It was the last Test cricket Afridi played until 2010.

Afridi was charged on 8 February 2007 of bringing the game into disrepute after he was seen on camera thrusting his bat at a spectator who swore at him on his way up the steps after being dismissed. Afridi was given a four-game ODI suspension, the minimum possible ban for such an offence, meaning that he would miss Pakistan&#x27;s first two 2007 World Cup matches. The PCB and Afridi chose not to appeal the ban, despite feeling that the punishment was excessively harsh.

In the 2007 World Twenty20, he didn&#x27;t perform well in terms of batting but ended the tournament as the joint-second highest wicket taker, earning the Man of the Series award. In the final he failed to take a wicket in the final and was out for a golden duck. He also became the first person to receive the Player of the Tournament award in T20 World Cup history. But in the next T20 World Cup, Afridi performed well, scoring 50 runs in the semi-final and 54 in the final which lead to Pakistan winning the World Cup.

=== Captaincy (2009–2011) ===
Shortly after Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, the captain: Younis Khan, announced his retirement from Twenty20 cricket. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) subsequently announced that Shahid Afridi had taken over as captain in T20Is; the appointment was initially for one match, with a decision on the permanent replacement to be made later. His spell of 6–38 against Australia in 2010 was voted as the Best ODI Bowling Performance of 2009 by ESPNcricinfo. On 31 January 2010, Afridi was caught on camera biting into the ball towards the end of the 5th Commonwealth Bank ODI series in Australia. Later Afridi pleaded guilty to ball tampering and he was banned from two Twenty20 internationals.

In March 2010 the board announced that Shahid Afridi had been appointed ODI captain in place of the sacked Mohammad Yousuf. He led Pakistan in the 2010 Asia Cup and during his first three matches as ODI captain he scored two centuries against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh he finished as the tournaments highest runscorer with 265 runs from 3 matches.

On 25 May 2010, Afridi was appointed captain of the national team in all three formats, after he announced his return to Test cricket. In July 2010, Afridi captained Pakistan in the first Test of the series at Lord&#x27;s against Australia. He scored 31 off 15 deliveries in the first innings and 2 in the second but was dismissed succumbing to rash strokes in both the innings. After the match, he announced retirement from Test cricket again citing lack of temperament for Test cricket as the reason. Afridi was officially removed from the Test squad on the England tour, but after the spot-fixing scandal saw Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Test captain Salman Butt temporarily suspended by the International Cricket Council, he stated that he might return to Test cricket if &quot;the team needs it&quot;. According to a representative of Afridi, he had voiced his concerns about Mazhar Majeed – who had approached Pakistan&#x27;s players – in June. Majeed also confirmed that he approached Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Younis Khan and Saeed Ajmal but all off them refused to be affiliated with him of his fixing menace. No disciplinary action was taken against them by the ICC.

In October, Afridi stated in an interview with &quot;Express News&quot; that the squad for the series against South Africa had been selected without his consultation; the PCB gave him an official warning for the interview. Coach Waqar Younis also expressed his unhappiness at having no input in the selection; however, Mohsin Khan, the chief selector, defended the decision, stating, &quot;it is not written down in the PCB constitution that the coach and captain(s) must have a say in the selection of any squad&quot;. Pakistan lost the series 3–2.
The team toured New Zealand between December 2010 and February 2011 for two Tests, six ODIs, and three T20Is. Pakistan lost the first two T20Is but won the third; in final match Afridi became the first cricketer to reach 50 international wickets in the format. In the same match, he also became the first cricketer to have completed the double of 500 runs and 50 wickets in the T20 Internationals.
When Pakistan&#x27;s squad for the 2011 World Cup was announced no captain was named; Afridi, the incumbent ODI captain and Misbah-ul-Haq, the Test captain, were the front runners for the position. Pakistan lost the first match against New Zealand by 8-wickets, the second match got rained out and in the third Mohammad Hafeez scored a century and Afridi scored a blistering 65 from just 25 balls. The following match was a tight game but Pakistan prevailed by two-wickets thanks to three boundaries from Sohail Tanvir, the match was set up by a 93 not out from Misbah-ul-Haq. The fifth ODI was won for Pakistan by 43 runs courtesy of a maiden ODI-century from Ahmed Shehzad. Afridi helped in the lower order by scoring 24 and taking two crucial top order wickets to help guide Pakistan to a 43-run victory and their first ODI series win in two years.

After gaining victory as a captain against New Zealand, the PCB declared Shahid Afridi as Pakistan&#x27;s captain for the 2011 World Cup. In Pakistan&#x27;s opening match of the tournament, Afridi took 5 wickets for 16 runs against Kenya, giving him the best bowling figures by a Pakistan bowler in a World Cup. In the following match against Sri Lanka, which Pakistan won, Afridi claimed four more wickets to help his side to victory and became the second player to have scored 4,000 runs and taken 300 wickets in ODIs. He claimed 17 wickets from 6 matches in the first round of the Cup, including a five-wicket haul against Canada, as Pakistan finished top of their group and progressed to the next stage. After beating the West Indies in the quarter-final, with Afridi taking four wickets, Pakistan were knocked out of the semi-finals in a 29-run defeat to India. Afridi was the tournament&#x27;s joint-leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets, level with India&#x27;s Zaheer Khan, even though Afridi had played one match less than him.

Soon after the World Cup Pakistan toured the West Indies for a T20I, five ODIs, and two Tests. Pakistan lost the only T20I but won the ODI series that followed 3–2. Afridi took two wickets and scored 28 runs in the series. The coach, Waqar Younis, fell out with Afridi and in his report on the tour criticised Afridi, saying &quot;as a captain he is very immature, has poor discipline, lacks a gameplan and is unwilling to listen to others&#x27; opinions or advice&quot;. After the series, on 19 May, the PCB replaced Afridi as ODI captain with Misbah-ul-Haq for the two-match ODI series against Ireland later that month. In 34 ODIs as captain, Afridi led his side to 18 wins and 15 defeats. Afridi subsequently withdrew from the touring squad, citing the illness of his father.

=== Conditional retirement and return (2011–2015) ===
On 30 May, Afridi announced his conditional retirement from international cricket in protest against his treatment by the PCB. The condition on his return was that the board be replaced. The PCB suspended Afridi&#x27;s central contract, fined him 4.5 million rupees ($52,300), and revoked his no-objection certificate (NOC) which allowed Afridi to play for Hampshire. Afridi filed a petition with the Sindh High Court to overturn the sanctions. On 15 June, Afridi withdrew his petition after an out of court settlement and the PCB reinstated his NOC. When the PCB&#x27;s central contracts were renewed in August, Afridi&#x27;s was allowed to lapse. In October he withdrew his retirement as Ijaz Butt had been replaced as chairman of the PCB.
 Two weeks after his announcement, Afridi was included in Pakistan&#x27;s squad to face Sri Lanka in three ODIs and a T20I. In November 2011, Afridi became the only cricketer to score a half-century and take five wickets on two separate occasions in ODIs. Afridi achieved this feat in the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka which helped Pakistan to secure the one-day series. He also became the first person to play 50 T20Is.

In 2013 during the first ODI game against the West Indies in Guyana, Afridi scored 76(55) before taking figures of 7/12, the second best ODI bowling figures ever. In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s.

Afridi announced his retirement from ODI cricket after 2015 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan lost to Australia in the quarter-final and got eliminated from the tournament.

=== 2016 ICC World Twenty20 ===
In March 2016, Pakistan was unable to make it to the semi-finals in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing to New Zealand, India and Australia. Before Australia&#x27;s match, the PCB hinted at Afridi&#x27;s retirement. However, he went against their decision after the match and announced that he would make the decision himself after consulting family and other iconic players beforehand and also announce it in Pakistan. He also stated that &#x27;as a player, I am fit. As a captain, I am not fit&#x27;. Former Australian player Ian Chappell praised his honesty in this confession.

Waqar Younis, the head coach, was initially blamed and he accepted responsibility and offered to retire. However, a six-page report by Younis was later leaked by the PCB to the media where he was shown to be pointing much of the blame onto Afridi. First Younis claimed that Afridi was &#x27;unfair&#x27; to new cricketer Mohammad Nawaz by calling him up to bowl in the Asia Cup 2016 because it &#x27;destroyed the youngster&#x27;s confidence&#x27; after he gave 38-runs in 3 overs. Younis went on to accuse Afridi of being &#x27;non-serious&#x27; in the game along with saying that he missed training sessions and meetings. He also said that Afridi showed poor performance with the bat, ball and as a captain and was clearly not listened to by other players. Younis expressed great anger on the report being leaked as it led to fans criticising him for shifting the blame onto Afridi instead of accepting equal responsibility. Manager Intikhab Alam also called Afridi &#x27;clueless&#x27; in the 3 matches but said Younis was unable to ensure that the players were physically fit.

Afridi was asked to appear to the enquiry committee, made up of Misbah-ul-Haq and other iconic players, who would hear his view on the situation. However, it was said he refused to until it was revealed that his daughter was in hospital undergoing surgery at the time. He opted to be interviewed by phone.

Days after the match, Afridi posted a video on Twitter, in which he apologised to all his fans for the team&#x27;s disappointing performance. He said he didn&#x27;t care about what others were saying about him and only wanted to answer to his fans and wanted to apologise for letting them and Pakistan down. Despite earlier criticism, many fans supported him. Even during his arrival from Dubai back to Pakistan, a few days after the rest of the team, fans chanted &#x27;Boom Boom Afridi&#x27; at the airport amidst high security.

In April 2016, he finally announced he was stepping down as T20I captain, but was not retiring. He said he wanted to &quot;continue to play the game for my country&quot;. Sarfraz Ahmed was appointed as Pakistan&#x27;s T20I captain following Afridi&#x27;s resignation.

=== Retirement ===
In September 2016, the PCB announced that they wanted Afridi to retire. Afridi said it was unfair for them to announce their plans in the media, but then said that he wanted a farewell match, which didn&#x27;t happen as a result of him cancelling a meeting regarding the issue with the PCB. In February 2017, he announced his retirement from T20Is and international cricket. In April 2018, Afridi briefly returned to international cricket after he was named in the Rest of the World XI squad for the Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge. He went on to captain the side, after Eoin Morgan had to withdraw due to injury. After the match, Afridi stated that he would not be making a comeback to international cricket for Pakistan.

== Post-retirement ==

=== Cricket administration ===
On 24 December 2022, Afridi was named the interim chief selector of the Pakistani cricket team by the newly appointed PCB Chairman, Najam Sethi. His term lasted until the end of the New Zealand series with Pakistan drawing the Test series 0–0 and losing the ODI series 2–1. Sethi had offered him a longer term but Afridi refused due to his commitments to charity work and his foundation.

=== Business ===
In February 2022, Afridi opened a restaurant, Lala Darbar, in Dubai, which he described as an &quot;authentic desi restaurant chain&quot;.

In 2023, Afridi launched the Shahid Afridi Store, a menswear fashion brand.

== Playing style ==
=== Batting ===
His general style of batting was very aggressive and attack oriented. Due to this reason, Indian cricketer Ravi Shastri gave him the nickname &quot;Boom Boom&quot;. He scored six ODI centuries, including ones made from 37 and 45 balls, two of the fastest in history. Throughout his career, he had an ODI strike rate of 117 runs per 100 balls, one of the highest in the game&#x27;s history. This attitude was transferred to Test cricket as well, with Afridi scoring at a relatively high strike rate of 86.97.

He was known for hitting long sixes. He holds the record for having hit the most sixes in the history of ODI cricket. However, his aggressive style increased his risk of getting out and he was regarded as an inconsistent batsmen. This is reflected by the fact that he is the only player to score more than 8,000 ODI runs at an average under 30 (23.57 to be exact). Afridi has moved about the batting order, and this lack of consistency has made it difficult for him to settle. In the Indian subcontinent, where the ball quickly loses its shine, he preferred to open the batting; however, elsewhere he would come to bat at number six or seven.

On 22 August 2017, in his 256th Twenty20 match, Afridi hit his first century in the format, scoring 101 for Hampshire in the 2017 NatWest t20 Blast against Derbyshire and setting the highest T20 score by a batsman at the County Ground, Derby in the process.

=== Bowling ===
Having started as a fast bowler, Afridi decided to start bowling spin after he was told he was throwing. He modelled himself on Pakistan leg-spinner Abdul Qadir. Afridi began his career as primarily a bowler, but after scoring the fastest century in his maiden ODI innings more was expected of him with the bat. In 2011, he said, &quot;I consider myself a bowler first&quot;. He took 541 International wickets in his career, most of which were from the ODI format. While his stock ball is the leg break, his armoury also includes the googly and a &quot;quicker one&quot; which he can deliver in the style of a medium-pacer, reaching speeds of around .

On 23 August 2018, after a match winning all-round performance in the Caribbean Premier League for Barbados Tridents, Australian cricketer Steve Smith said that he tried to model the bowling action of Afridi. He praised Afridi, calling him &quot;a terrific leg-spinner&quot;. Afghani cricketer Rashid Khan has said that he grew up idolising Afridi and modelled Afridi&#x27;s bowling action.

== Philanthropy ==
In March 2014, Shahid Afridi established the Shahid Afridi Foundation which aims to provide healthcare and education facilities in Pakistan. He was named among the world&#x27;s most charitable athletes by Do Something in August 2015.

UNICEF and many Pakistani authorities have taken Shahid Afridi on board for the anti-polio campaign in the tribal belt of Waziristan region.

== Awards and recognition ==
On 23 March 2010, Afridi was awarded the Pride of Performance by President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari.

On 23 March 2018, he was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz by President of Pakistan Mamnoon Hussain.

== Controversies ==
In July 2016, Afridi said in an interview with BBC Urdu that there is no talent in Pakistan. This resulted in huge opposition against Afridi, while PCB issued a notice against him. Later, Afridi tried to clarify his statement by explaining that there is no competition among players in the present.

On 6 September 2018, in a Defence Day event at Rawalpindi, Afridi was reportedly caught on the camera chewing tobacco. He was highly criticised by the media for this. However, Afridi denied these claims and clarified that he had been eating fennel seeds and clove.

On 30 April 2019, Shahid Afridi was sued by Master Beverages for violating agreement. As per Master Beverages and Foods Limited, Shahid Afridi had signed a contract with Master Beverages as their brand ambassador, but also secretly signed an agreement to become a brand ambassador of another rival company. According to the agreement, Afridi couldn&#x27;t sign for any other company. Master Beverages instituted a lawsuit against Afridi in Sindh High Court for damages amounting to 60,000,000 and recovery of a car which Afridi received as part of the agreement.

In May 2019, Afridi stated that being a &quot;conservative&quot; and religious father, he had banned his daughters from playing outdoor sports. He said &quot;feminists can say what they want... I&#x27;ve made my decision,&quot; in response to the criticism.

=== Confusion about age ===
Shahid Afridi, who made his debut at 16 as per the records, had claimed that he was born in 1975 in his autobiography &#x27;Game Changer&#x27;. &quot;Also, for the record, I was just nineteen, and not sixteen like they claim. I was born in 1975. So, yes, the authorities stated my age incorrectly&quot;, he wrote in his book. Although that created confusion as if he was born in 1975, it would have meant that he was 21 at the time of debut and not 19 as he wrote. Afridi later clarified that his autobiography&#x27;s first edition carried the wrong year and it was confirmed that his year of birth was 1977. Afridi&#x27;s claims created further controversy as this would have meant that Afghani batsman, Usman Ghani, would hold the record for the youngest centurion in ODI cricket which Afridi currently holds.

=== Feud with Gautam Gambhir ===
Afridi has been infamously involved in several on and off the field feuds with Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir. On 14 November 2007, during an ODI between India and Pakistan, Afridi and Gambhir were involved in an altercation, followed by a heated argument, where on-field umpire Ian Gould intervened in between. Both Afridi and Gambhir were fined for the event, for conduct unbecoming and physical contact.

Afridi again came to feud with Gambhir on Twitter, when the former tweeted about the unrest in Kashmir in April 2018, where he also tagged the United Nations. In response to the tweet, Gambhir replied by mocking Afridi and stated that he has no understanding about Kashmir. In response to criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Afridi in May 2020, Gambhir stated by tweeting that &quot;Jokers like Afridi, Imran and Bajwa can spew venom against India &amp; PM @narendramodi ji to fool Pak ppl but won&#x27;t get Kashmir till judgment day! Remember Bangladesh?&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Irish pop group The Duckworth Lewis Method included a song called &quot;Boom Boom Afridi&quot; in their second album &quot;Sticky Wickets&quot;.

<text>Leyland Motors Limited (later known as the Leyland Motor Corporation) was an English vehicle manufacturer of lorries, buses and trolleybuses. The company diversified into car manufacturing with its acquisitions of Triumph and Rover in 1960 and 1967, respectively. It gave its name to the British Leyland Motor Corporation, formed when it merged with British Motor Holdings in 1968, to become British Leyland after being nationalised. British Leyland later changed its name to simply BL, then in 1986 to Rover Group.

After the various vehicle manufacturing businesses of BL and its successors went defunct or were divested, the following marques survived: Jaguar and Land Rover, now built by Jaguar Land Rover owned by TATA Motors; MG, now built by MG Motor, and Mini, now built by BMW. The truck building operation survived largely intact as Leyland Trucks, a subsidiary of Paccar.

==History==

===Beginning===


Leyland Motors has a long history dating from 1896, when the Sumner and Spurrier families founded the Lancashire Steam Motor Company in the town of Leyland in North West England. Their first products included steam powered lawn mowers. The company&#x27;s first vehicle was a 1.5-ton-capacity steam powered van. This was followed by a number of undertype steam wagons using a vertical fire-tube boiler. By 1905 they had also begun to build petrol-engined wagons. The Lancashire Steam Motor Company was renamed Leyland Motors in 1907 when it took over Coulthards of Preston, who had been making steam wagons since 1897. They also built a second factory in the neighbouring town of Chorley which still remains today as the headquarters of the Lex Autolease and parts company.

In 1920, Leyland Motors produced the Leyland Eight luxury touring car, a development of which was driven by J.G. Parry-Thomas at Brooklands. Parry-Thomas was later killed in an attempt on the land speed record when the car overturned. Rumours that a chain drive broke were found to be incorrect when the car was disinterred late in the 20th century as the chains were intact. At the other extreme, they also produced the Trojan Utility Car in the Kingston upon Thames factory at Ham from 1922 to 1928.

Three generations of Spurriers controlled Leyland Motors from its foundation until the retirement of Henry Spurrier in 1964. Spurrier inherited control of Leyland Motors from his father in 1942, and successfully guided its growth during the postwar years. Whilst the Spurrier family were in control the company enjoyed excellent labour relations—reputedly never losing a day&#x27;s production through industrial action.

===World War II===
During World War II, Leyland Motors, along with most vehicle manufacturers, was involved in war production. Leyland built the Cromwell tank at its works from 1943 as well as medium/large trucks such as the Hippo and Retriever.

After the war, Leyland Motors continued military manufacture with the Centurion tank.

===Post war===

In 1946, AEC and Leyland Motors formed British United Traction to build trolleybuses.

In 1955, through an equity agreement, manufacture of commercial vehicles under licence from Leyland Motors commenced in Madras, India at the new Ashok factory. The products were branded as Ashok Leyland.

Leyland Motors acquired other companies in the post war years:
* 1951: Albion Motors
* 1953: Collaboration with Danish Automobile Building (DAB), a bus manufacturer, later with a majority stake in the 1970s
* 1955: Scammell—military and specialist lorry manufacturer
* 1961: Standard-Triumph (Standard-Triumph International Limited), cars, vans and some agricultural machinery interests

===Holding company: Leyland Motor Corporation===

Donald Stokes, previously Sales Director, was appointed managing director of Leyland Motors Limited in September 1962. Originally a Leyland student apprentice he had grown up with the company. He became chairman in 1966. Chronologically, the 1960s growth of Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC) was as follows:

* 1962: Leyland Motors acquires Associated Commercial Vehicles (ACV), which incorporated AEC, Thornycroft, Park Royal Vehicles and Charles H Roe.
* 1962 a new group holding company was incorporated to own Leyland Motors Limited, ACV and new acquisitions
* 1965: Minority (25%) interests in Bristol Commercial Vehicles and Eastern Coach Works
* 1966: Acquisition of The Rover Company and their subsidiary car, aero-engine and armoured fighting vehicle manufacturer Alvis Car and Engineering Company
* 1967: Aveling-Barford was acquired This company mainly made road rollers and dumper trucks.

In 1968 Leyland Motors merged with British Motor Holdings (BMH) to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). BMH, which was the product of an earlier merger between the British Motor Corporation, the Pressed Steel Company and Jaguar, brought with it more marques, including Daimler, Guy, BMC, Austin, MG and Morris. Leyland diesel engines were used in Finnish Sisu and Vanaja lorries and buses in 1960s.

===British Leyland era===
The BLMC group was difficult to manage because of the many companies under its control, often making similar products. This, and other reasons, led to financial difficulties and in December 1974 British Leyland had to receive a guarantee from the British government.

In 1975, after the publication of the Ryder Report and the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, BLMC was nationalised as British Leyland (BL) and split into four divisions with the bus and truck production becoming the Leyland Truck &amp; Bus division within the Land Rover Leyland Group. This division was split into Leyland Bus and Leyland Trucks in 1981. Leyland Trucks depended on British sales as well as export markets, mainly Commonwealth and ex-Commonwealth markets. The early 1980s were very hard, with export sales drying up in many places such as oil-dependent Nigeria. In 1986, BL changed its name to Rover Group, with its name being derived from the Rover brand that Leyland had bought in the 1960s, and would eventually gain prominence as BL gradually retired most of its marques. The equity stake in Ashok Leyland was controlled by Land Rover Leyland International Holdings, and sold in 1987. At this point, while building about 10,000 trucks per annum, Leyland was more and more depending on outside engines as production of their own 98-series was steadily declining. The 1986 closure of Bedford Vehicles&#x27; heavy truck plant further harmed Leyland, as they had been planning on selling axles and other components to the General Motors subsidiary.

===Leyland name post-British Leyland===
====Buses====
The bus operations was sold in a management buyout to form Leyland Bus, and was subsequently bought by Volvo in 1988, which then discontinued most of its product range but kept the Olympian. Volvo reengineered and renamed it as the first named Volvo Bus model, the Volvo Olympian, and aside from minor frame changes the major alterations were the fitment of Volvo axles, braking system, and controls. Both were the best selling double-deck bus chassis of their time.

====Trucks====
* 1987 The Leyland Trucks division of Rover Group (formerly BL) (which included the Freight Rover division) merged with DAF Trucks of The Netherlands to form DAF NV (which in the UK traded as Leyland DAF and elsewhere as DAF), and was floated on the Dutch stock exchange. The new company had three plants; two truck plants in Eindhoven and Leyland, and a van plant in Washwood Heath.
* 1993 DAF NV went into bankruptcy. All three plants were bought through a management buy-out, the truck plant in Eindhoven resumed trading as DAF Trucks, the truck plant in Leyland resumed trading as Leyland Trucks and the van plant in Washwood Heath became LDV which continued trading until 2009. The spare parts operation, Multipart, was subject to a management buy-out, eventually becoming part of the LEX organisation.
* 1996/1998 Both DAF Trucks &amp; Leyland Trucks were acquired by the US truck manufacturer Paccar. Leyland Trucks now operates as a division of Paccar from the Leyland Assembly Plant in North West England manufacturing around 14,000 trucks per year of which about a third are sold in the EU, though marketed under the DAF name and not with the name Leyland.

===Ashok Leyland===
The Leyland name and logo continues as a recognised and respected marque across India, the wider subcontinent and parts of Africa in the form of Ashok Leyland. Part of the giant Hinduja Group, Ashok Leyland manufactures buses, trucks, defence vehicles and engines. The company is a leader in the heavy transportation sector within India and has an aggressive expansionary policy. In 1987 the London based Hinduja Group bought the Indian-based Ashok Leyland company. Today, Ashok-Leyland is pursuing a joint venture with Nissan, and through its acquisition of the Czech truck maker, Avia, is entering the European truck market directly. With its purchase of a 26% stake in UK-based bus manufacturer Optare in 2010, Ashok Leyland has taken a step closer to reconnecting with its British heritage, as Optare is a direct descendant of Leyland&#x27;s UK bus-making division. On 21 December 2011, Ashok Leyland bought an additional 49% stake in Optare, bringing its total to 75%.

==Products==

===Buses===
Historically, Leyland Motors was a major manufacturer of buses used in the United Kingdom and worldwide. It achieved a number of firsts or milestones that set trends for the bus industry. It was one of the first manufacturers to devise chassis designs for buses that were different from trucks, with a lower chassis level to help passengers board more easily. Its chief designer, John George Rackham, who had experience at the Yellow Coach Company in Chicago before returning to England, created the Titan and Tiger ranges in 1927 that revolutionised bus design. After 1945, Leyland created another milestone with the trend-setting Atlantean rear-engined double-decker bus design produced between 1956 and 1986.

The G-series cab was built in Bathgate and was available with several different names, such as Terrier, Clydesdale, and Reiver. After this cab was replaced the tooling was shipped to Turkey, where BMC&#x27;s Turkish subsidiary built it as the &quot;BMC Yavuz&quot; and then as the &quot;Fatih&quot; (with Cummins engines) from 1986 until 1996.

The Marathon was Leyland&#x27;s answer to the booming &quot;max cap&quot; truck fad at the start of the 1970s. Imports such as the Volvo F88 and Scania 110/140 were selling very well in the UK thanks to the previously unheard of levels of driver comfort, reliability, quality and performance.

Leyland had insufficient money for development of a complete new vehicle at the time, so designers were instructed to utilise as many existing in-house components as possible. It was perceived at the time that the resulting model would be a stopgap until the new T45 range was ready for production toward the latter half of the 1970s.
The cab was a re-worked version of the &quot;Ergomatic&quot; tilt cab of 1965, heavily modified with different lower panels, raised height etc., and was available in day and sleeper cab form. Engines were decided from the outset to be in the higher power category to be competitive with rival vehicles. The only existing engine within the Leyland empire suitable for such an application (following the demise of the ill-fated fixed-head 500 series and AEC&#x27;s underdeveloped and unreliable V8) was the AEC AV760 straight-six, which was turbocharged and designated as the TL12. Other engine options included a 200 bhp Leyland L11, as well as Cummins 10- and 14-litre engines at 250 and 330 bhp, respectively.

Production began in 1973, and various shortcomings were noted, including below-par heating and ventilation, and pronounced cab roll. However, road testers of the time were very impressed by the truck&#x27;s power and performance. In 1977, the redesigned &quot;Marathon 2&quot; was launched, an updated and revised vehicle that attempted to address some of the previous criticisms of the earlier vehicle. Relatively few Marathons of all types were sold before production ended in 1979 with the introduction of the T45 &quot;roadtrain&quot; range of vehicles.

====1980s====
=====Roadrunner=====
This was Leyland&#x27;s answer to the Ford cargo in the non-HGV 7.5-ton truck sector. Launched in 1984, it utilised a Leyland 698 straight-six engine until 1986, when a 5.9 L Cummins was introduced. It was notable at the time for its low-level passenger side windscreen, featured as a safety aid to enable the driver to see the kerb, although this was removed on later models. The basic cab had a long service life, being used later on the Leyland DAF 45.

=====Constructor=====
The Leyland Constructor was a 6x4, three axle wagon with gross weight up to 24 tonnes used as a tipper or on short haul distribution duties.

=====Roadtrain=====

The Leyland Roadtrain was a range of heavy goods vehicle tractor units manufactured by Leyland Trucks between 1980 and 1990. The nomenclature &quot;T45&quot; refers to the truck range as a whole and encompasses models such as the lightweight 7.5-ton Roadrunner, Freighter (fourwheel rigid truck), Constructor (multi-axle rigid tipper or mixer chassis – its chassis owing much to the outgoing Scammell 8-wheeler Routeman), and Cruiser (basic spec low weight tractor unit). The Roadtrain itself was a max weight model with distance work in mind.

The T45&#x27;s cab is called the C40 and its design was a joint effort between Leyland, BRS and Ogle Design and was seen as the height of modernity when compared with its predecessors, the idea being to have one basic design to replace the various outgoing models (for example, the Bathgate built the G cab on the Terrier, the Ergomatic cabbed the Lynx, Beaver etc.). This did indeed make good economic sense; however, there has been speculation that Leyland did in fact alienate a number of customers who had traditionally purchased other marques from within the Leyland empire—Albion, AEC, Scammell, etcetera – who were now left with no alternative but to have a Leyland-branded vehicle or purchase from elsewhere. Some Constructors, with their Scammell-based chassis, were built with Scammell badging as well.

Throughout its production run, engine choices included the AEC-based TL12, a straight carry over from the preceding &quot;stopgap&quot; model Marathon range, The Rolls-Royce Eagle 265/300 and the Cummins 290 L10 and 14-litre 350 coupled to a Spicer or Eaton transmission, although all versions produced a distinctive whine from the propshaft knuckle joint when approaching . The TL12 engine was dropped early on in the production run, with most large fleet buyers choosing the Rolls-Royce engine.

The Roadtrain was available in day- and sleeper-cabbed form, in high and low datum versions—this refers to the cab height—high datum versions were intended as long haul vehicles with higher mounted cabs and more internal space. 6x2 versions were built in high cab form only on a chassis that was basically that of the ageing Scammell trunker. The Constructor&#x27;s chassis was entirely Routeman behind the cab, albeit with altered suspension and with the front chassis rails splayed wider apart to fit the new C40 cab.

In 1986, the high roofed Roadtrain interstate was introduced, a top of the range long distance truck with standing room inside.

The Roadtrain was a common sight throughout most of the 1980s, with a great many of the major fleet users in the UK such as Tesco, Blue Circle Industries (unusually with high datum day cabs) and BRS running them. The firm of Swain&#x27;s based in Rochester, Kent had a number of roadtrains in its fleet which enjoyed a comparatively long service life (until the late 1990s) before being replaced by the newer DAF 85. Sales were never quite satisfactory, however, with the vacation closure extended in 1986 to reduce unsold stock.

Production ended in 1990, a few years after the sale of Leyland Trucks to Dutch firm DAF in 1987, although as a postscript DAF relaunched the model in low-datum form (it was already manufacturing the large DAF 95) as the DAF 80, using the Roadtrain cab with the DAF 330 ATi engine (quite ironic, given that this engine had its roots in the Leyland O.680). This model was produced for a relatively short time until 1993 with the launch of the brand new cabbed DAF 85.

Due partly to the cab&#x27;s propensity to rust and also to the admittedly short life of commercial vehicles, any Roadtrain in commercial operation is now a very rare sight indeed. However, a small number remain in use throughout the country as towing-and-recovery vehicles.

The army made use of an 8x6 version of the Roadtrain as a hook loader until recently. This is known to the British Army as Medium Mobility Load System (MMLS) Demountable Rack Offload and Pickup System (DROPS), which has seen action in Iraq and Afghanistan and is still in service, but has now been replaced by the MAN version. In this format the British Army purchased 1,440 vehicles plus a significant number of spare Roadtrain cabs, to allow for accident damage

====Landtrain====
The Leyland Landtrain was produced between 1980 and 1987, specifically for export markets. A bonneted design, it was built in the UK and exported in completed and kit form, the latter for local construction in Kenya and Nigeria.

=====Comet=====
The Leyland Comet was introduced in 1986, also designed for export markets mainly in the developing world. As such, it was a no-frills vehicle of a simple and sturdy design, with five- or six-speed transmissions rather than the multi-speed units used on European models. The cabin was a simplified all-steel version of that used by the Roadrunner, designed to enable local assembly. The three-axle version is called the Super Comet.

==Educational film==
Leyland Motors produced a film in 1977 entitled &quot;The Quality Connection&quot; showing the importance of quality control. It featured well known actors including Frank Windsor, George A Cooper, David Suchet, Michael Robbins, Madeline Smith and Trevor Bannister.

<text>In control theory, a causal system (also known as a physical or nonanticipative system) is a system where the output depends on past and
current inputs but not future inputs—i.e., the output formula_1 depends only on the input formula_2 for values of formula_3.

The idea that the output of a function at any time depends only on past and present values of input is defined by the property commonly referred to as causality. A system that has &quot;some&quot; dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible dependence on past or current input values) is termed a non-causal or acausal system, and a system that depends &quot;solely&quot; on future input values is an anticausal system. Note that some authors have defined an anticausal system as one that depends solely on future &quot;and present&quot; input values or, more simply, as a system that does not depend on past input values. 

Classically, nature or physical reality has been considered to be a causal system. Physics involving special relativity or general relativity require more careful definitions of causality, as described elaborately in Causality (physics).

The causality of systems also plays an important role in digital signal processing, where filters are constructed so that they are causal, sometimes by altering a non-causal formulation to remove the lack of causality so that it is realizable. For more information, see causal filter.

For a causal system, the impulse response of the system must use only the present and past values of the input to determine the output. This requirement is a necessary and sufficient condition for a system to be causal, regardless of linearity. Note that similar rules apply to either discrete or continuous cases. By this definition of requiring no future input values, systems must be causal to process signals in real time.

== Mathematical definitions ==

Definition 1: A system mapping formula_4 to formula_5 is causal if and only if, for any pair of input signals formula_6, formula_7 and any choice of formula_8, such that
:formula_9
the corresponding outputs satisfy
:formula_10

Definition 2: Suppose formula_11 is the impulse response of any system formula_12 described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation. The system formula_12 is causal if and only if
:formula_14
otherwise it is non-causal.

<text>In astronomical spectroscopy, the Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of distant galaxies and quasars arising from the Lyman-alpha electron transition of the neutral hydrogen atom. As the light travels through multiple gas clouds with different redshifts, multiple absorption lines are formed.

==History==
The Lyman-alpha forest was first discovered in 1970 by astronomer Roger Lynds in an observation of the quasar 4C 05.34. Quasar 4C 05.34 was the farthest object observed to that date, and Lynds noted an unusually large number of absorption lines in its spectrum and suggested that most of the absorption lines were all due to the same Lyman-alpha transition. Follow-up observations by John Bahcall and Samuel Goldsmith confirmed the presence of the unusual absorption lines, though they were less conclusive about the origin of the lines. Subsequently, the spectra of many other high-redshift quasars were observed to have the same system of narrow absorption lines. Lynds was the first to describe them as the &quot;Lyman-alpha forest&quot;. Jan Oort argued that the absorption features are due not to any physical interactions within the quasars themselves, but to absorption inside clouds of intergalactic gas in superclusters.

==Physical background==
For a neutral hydrogen atom, spectral lines are formed when an electron transitions between energy levels. The Lyman series of spectral lines are produced by electrons transitioning between the ground state and higher energy levels (excited states). The Lyman-alpha transition corresponds to an electron transitioning between the ground state (&quot;n&quot; = 1) and the first excited state (&quot;n&quot; = 2). The Lyman-alpha spectral line has a laboratory wavelength (or rest wavelength) of 1216 Å, which is in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar spectra result from intergalactic gas through which the galaxy or quasar&#x27;s light has traveled. Since neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium are at different degrees of redshift (due to their varying distance from Earth), their absorption lines are observed at a range of wavelengths. Each individual cloud leaves its fingerprint as an absorption line at a different position in the observed spectrum.

==Use as a tool in astrophysics==

The Lyman-alpha forest is an important probe of the intergalactic medium and can be used to determine the frequency and density of clouds containing neutral hydrogen, as well as their temperature. Searching for lines from other elements like helium, carbon and silicon (matching in redshift), the abundance of heavier elements in the clouds can also be studied. A cloud with a high column density of neutral hydrogen will show typical damping wings around the line and is referred to as a damped Lyman-alpha system.

For quasars at higher redshift the number of lines in the forest is higher, until at a redshift of about 6, where there is so much neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium that the forest turns into a Gunn–Peterson trough. This shows the end of the reionization of the universe.

The Lyman-alpha forest observations can be used to constrain cosmological models. They can also be used to constrain the properties of dark matter, such as the dark matter free streaming scale, which for thermal relic dark matter models is closely related to the dark matter particle mass.

<doc id="554090" wikidata="Q1518169" url="?curid=554090" title="Key lime pie">
<text>Key lime pie is an American dessert pie. It is made of Key lime juice, egg yolks, and sweetened condensed milk. It may be served with no topping, with a meringue topping made from egg whites, or with whipped cream. Traditionally, Key Lime pie is made using a graham cracker crust. It may be made with or without baking in a pie crust or without crust. The dish is named after the small Key limes, which are more aromatic than the common Persian limes, and which have yellow juice. The filling in a Key lime pie is typically yellow because of the egg yolks.

The filling is made similarly to a Magic Lemon cream pie, by mixing the ingredients without cooking: the proteins of the egg yolks and condensed milk and the acidic lime juice curdle, thickening the mixture without baking. The pies are usually baked to pasteurize the eggs and thicken the filling further.

==History==

Key lime pie is probably derived from the &quot;Magic Lemon Cream Pie&quot; published in a promotional brochure by Borden, a producer of condensed milk, in 1931. The recipe is attributed to Borden&#x27;s fictional spokesperson, Jane Ellison, and includes condensed milk, lemon juice and rind, and egg yolks. It is covered with meringue, baked, and served cold. According to the pastry chef Stella Parks, users of the recipe altered it with local ingredients; she describes it as &quot;a stunning reminder of how deeply America&#x27;s traditions are shaped by advertising&quot;. In the 1980s, food writer John Egerton dated the presence of key lime pie in the Florida Keys to at least the 1890s, a dating author Jean Anderson characterized as credible due to nature of refrigeration standards of the time.

A &quot;Tropical Lime Chiffon Pie&quot;, using condensed milk and egg yolks, is documented in a 1933 Miami newspaper article. An &quot;icebox lime pie&quot;, was mentioned as a specialty of the Florida Keys in 1935. and a recipe under the name &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot; was published in 1940.

No earlier solid sources are known, despite appeals to the public. A 1927 Key West Women&#x27;s Club cookbook does not mention the recipe. A 1926 restaurant menu includes &quot;lime pie&quot;, but it is unclear what it was. Various accounts claim that it was known earlier, but none were recorded before 1933. A widely reported story claims that William Curry&#x27;s cook Aunt Sally invented it in the late 19th century. But there is no evidence for this, and the oldest version of this story dates to only 1995, in promotional materials for a Bed and Breakfast in Curry&#x27;s former house.

It was in the 1950s that Key lime pie was promoted as Florida&#x27;s &quot;most famous treat&quot; and in 1987 as &quot;the greatest of all regional American desserts.&quot;

==Key limes==
Key lime (&quot;Citrus aurantifolia&quot; &#x27;Swingle&#x27;) is naturalized throughout the Florida Keys. While the tree&#x27;s thorns make harvesting them less tractable, and the fruit&#x27;s thin, yellow rind is more perishable than the common Persian limes seen year-round at grocery stores in the United States, Key limes are both more tart and more aromatic. They have not been grown commercially in the U.S. since the 1926 Miami hurricane, and are generally imported from Central or South America. Key lime juice, unlike regular lime juice, is a pale yellow. Bottled Key lime juice, invariably from concentrate, is widely available at retail in the United States.

==Legislation==

Florida State Representative Bernie Papy, Jr. is said to have introduced geographical indication legislation in 1965 calling for a $100 fine to be levied against anyone advertising Key lime pie not made with Key limes. The bill failed.

Florida statute 15.052, passed in July 2006, designates Key lime pie &quot;the official Florida state pie&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
In the television series &quot;Dexter&quot;, key lime pie features significantly in the episode &quot;Easy As Pie&quot;, in which Camilla Figg tasks Dexter to bring her the &quot;perfect key lime pie.&quot;

<text>The udonkiri (うどん切), sobakiri (そば切 or 蕎麦切り包丁), and kashikiri are a group of specialized knives used in the Japanese kitchen to make &quot;udon&quot; and &quot;soba&quot; noodles respectively. The &quot;udonkiri&quot; is also sometimes called &quot;menkiribocho&quot; (麺切り包丁), and is distinguished from the Soba and Kashikiri knives by a blade that drops in to cover less than half of the length of the handle rather that reaching the end of the handle like the &quot;soba&quot;. The &quot;sobakiri&quot; is characterized by a long blade that spans down the full length of the handle whereas the blade of the Kashikiri only curves to meet the top of the handle. To make &quot;soba&quot; or &quot;udon&quot; the dough is flattened and folded, and then cut with the &quot;menkiribocho&quot; to produce long rectangular noodles. For this purpose the &quot;menkiribocho&quot; has a straight and long cutting edge to cut the noodles straight to the board. The knife is usually heavy to aid in the cutting of the noodles, usually with a slight forward motion.

<text>As part of the Arab–Israeli conflict, especially during the Second Intifada from 2000 to 2005, Palestinian militant groups allegedly used children for suicide bombings. Minors were sometimes used as messengers and couriers, and according to Israeli sources as fighters. However, no evidence was found of systematic recruitment of children by Palestinian armed groups. The involvement of children in armed conflict was condemned by international human rights organizations.

Other militant movements in Palestine have also used minors as combatants. 

== Background ==

According to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, in the Second Intifada, children were used as &quot;messengers and couriers, and in some cases as fighters and suicide bombers in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians&quot; during the Second Intifada. Fatah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine have all been implicated in involving children in this way. The issue was brought to world attention after a widely televised incident in which a mentally handicapped Palestinian teenager, Hussam Abdo, was disarmed at an Israeli checkpoint.

== Suicide bombings by minors ==
In late 2004, Human Rights Watch claimed that at least 10 bombers aged under 18 had been used by Palestinian militants to carry out attacks against Israel in the past four years.

The main Palestinian militant groups have publicly stated their opposition to the use of children in suicide attacks.

Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigade were all linked to underage attacks in the HRW report.

A report by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, similarly stated that there were at least nine documented suicide bombings against Israeli soldiers and civilians involving Palestinian minors between October 2000 and March 2004.

The report also found that &quot;there was no evidence of systematic recruitment of children by Palestinian armed groups&quot;, and that &quot;there was no evidence that the Palestinian Authority (PA) recruited or used child soldiers&quot;.

Some senior Palestinian militant figures had previously said that they considered individuals aged 16 or above as adults.

After a 16-year-old child was involved in a suicide attack in November 2004, the group responsible, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, admitted it had made a mistake and vowed to improve its age checking procedures.

Umm Nidal, who sent three of her sons, including one 17-year-old, on suicide attacks, said &quot;I love my children, but as Muslims we pressure ourselves and sacrifice our emotions for the interest of the homeland. The greater interest takes precedence to the personal interest&quot;. She was later elected to the Palestinian legislature in 2006 on the Hamas-led Change and Reform electoral list.

== Searches and prosecution of minors ==

=== By the State of Israel ===

On March 24, 2004, one week after capturing a bomb in the bag of 12-year-old Abdullah Quran, Hussam Abdo, a 16-year-old Palestinian (who initially claimed he was 14), was captured in a checkpoint near Nablus wearing an explosive belt. The young boy was paid by the Tanzim militia to detonate himself at the checkpoint. IDF soldiers manning the checkpoint were suspicious of him and told him to stay away from people. Later, an EOD team arrived and by using a police-sapper robot, removed the explosive belt from him. Hussam allegedly said that he was offered 100 NIS and sex with virgins if he would perform the task. He said his friends mocked him in class.

On May 30, 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Israeli allegations that the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades were using children to recruit classmates as suicide bombers, and that one child, Nasser Awartani, 15, of Nablus allegedly recruited four of his classmates, one of whom was claimed by the Shabak report on Awartani to be Hussam Abdo.

On July 3, the Israeli Security Forces claim that they thwarted a suicide bombing that it claimed was to have been carried out by 16-year-old Muataz Takhsin Karini. Karini and two of his operators were arrested, while a 12 kg explosive belt was detonated safely by an Israeli EOD crew. On June 5, IDF forces detonated two explosive belts concealed in schoolbags. On July 14, the Shin Bet in Kfar Maskha arrested 17-year-old suicide bomber Ahmed Bushkar, from Nablus.

On September 23, 2004, a day before Yom Kippur, the Shin Bet and the Israel Police claimed they had captured of a 15-year-old suicide bomber and a 7 kg explosive belt in the village of Dir-Hana in the Western Galilee. The 15-year-old was part of joint terrorist cell of Tanzim and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Yamon village near Jenin. The four were Palestinians who worked illegally in Israel. The 15-year-old was allegedly paid 1000 shekels in order to blow himself up in Afula.

According to nrg Maariv, on September 27, 2004, a 15-year-old suspected suicide bomber was arrested in Nablus. On October 28, Ayub Maaruf, a 16-year-old Fatah suicide bomber, was arrested near Nablus along with his operator.

According to Israel Defense Forces, on February 3, 2005, Mahmoud Tabouq, a 15 or 16-year-old Palestinian, was arrested at the Huwara checkpoint near Nablus carrying a bag containing an explosive belt, an improvised gun, and 20 bullets. The belt was detonated safely by a Magav bomb squad.

According to Ynet, on April 12, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy identified as Hassan Hashash was caught at Huwara checkpoint hiding five pipe bombs under his coat. He tried to ignite them with a match when the soldiers apprehended him. Later he was disarmed, and sappers detonated the bombs safely. Family members of Hashash suggested that he deliberately carried bombs into an IDF checkpoint in order to be arrested and study for the &quot;Bagrut&quot; final exams in the Israeli jail.

According to Hebrew language sources, on April 27, two teenagers, aged 15 (though other sources cite their ages as 12 and 13), were arrested at a checkpoint near Jenin after 11 explosive charges were found on them. One teenager was recruited by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the other by the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades. The two told interrogators that they had been acting as couriers for terrorists, but security forces suspect they planned to get close to the soldiers and then detonate the charges.

According to Ynet, on May 22, Iad Ladi, a 14 or 15-year-old Palestinian suicide bomber was arrested at a Huwara checkpoint near Nablus. This was the 14th time during April and May that a Palestinian child was arrested as a bomber or a courier. Two days later, another 15-year-old Palestinian teen carrying two pipe bombs, was caught at the same checkpoint. On June 15, The Israeli press reported that the Shabak arrested a Palestinian militant cell in Nablus during the previous month. The cell included eight members, four of whom were child suicide bombers. The cell was on the verge of committing another suicide bombing attack using the four children. According to the Shin Bet, the cell was directed and funded by the Fatah&#x27;s Tanzim branch and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

According to Ynet, on October 11, 2005, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was arrested by IDF forces. He told the soldiers he was forced to agree to commit a suicide bombing when two terrorists from Fatah&#x27;s Tanzim faction threatened to murder him by spreading a leaflet accusing him of collaboration unless he agreed. They took pictures of him with a gun and the Qur&#x27;an and forced him to write his own will.

According to Ynet, on August 27, 2007, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy carrying two explosive devices on his body was arrested in the northern Gaza Strip after he attempted to carry out an attack against soldiers operating in the area against Palestinians launching Qassam rockets on Israeli civilians across the border inside Israel.

==Media depictions and public diplomacy==
In 2002, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli military used an image of a Palestinian toddler dressed as a suicide bomber as part of Israel&#x27;s public diplomacy. The photo provided to international media by the IDF allegedly showed an 18-month infant dressed like a suicide bomber. The BBC published the photo but said, &quot;there was no independent confirmation of the authenticity of the photograph&quot;. The IDF claimed to have found the photo in a private family photo album, while raiding a suspect&#x27;s home. Dawn News reported that the photo was found in the home of a wanted militant named &quot;Al Khalil&quot;. According to BBC News the baby&#x27;s grandfather, Redwan Abu Turki, said that the dressing of the infant baby as a bomber was from a rally at the university and &quot;the picture was taken just for the fun of it&quot;. Israeli newspapers published the photo under headlines such as &quot;Terror in Diapers&quot;. and &quot;Born to Kill&quot;. The image was also shown on Israeli television.

A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said, “The photograph of the baby suicide bomber symbolizes the incitement and hatred which the Palestinian leadership have been using to brainwash an entire generation of Palestinian children who have, unfortunately, taken in this message like mother&#x27;s milk”.

Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator and cabinet minister said, “These are lies that they use to cover their own crimes, the murder of our children ... This week alone, six children were killed at the hands of Israeli forces”.

The photo was obtained by the IDF from a family photo album, and only used in public diplomacy by Israel, there was no suggestion that photo had been used in any Palestinian media or any other organized public communications by Palestinians. Palestinian officials dismissed it as a propaganda trick, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that a Palestinian journalist in the Hebron area said she did not believe the picture was a fake and expressed surprise at the furor it caused in Israel, noting: &quot;I can find you many, many photos like this,&quot; she said. &quot;Many kids imitate adults and wear toy masks and guns, especially during marches. It&#x27;s not strange at all&quot;. She added that she had seen children as young as the one in the photograph wearing similar costumes: &quot;In our society it happens a lot. It&#x27;s a kind of phenomenon&quot;.

The BBC report said it was &quot;not uncommon&quot; for Palestinian children to dress as bombers, but did not give other examples. Other photos of Palestinian children dressed up as militants, but not suicide bombers, were published in the same BBC report, including a photo of two boys wearing militant insignia and holding (what looked like) guns, captioned: &quot;The militants are heroes for many Palestinian children&quot;. Children on both sides of the conflict see combatants from their own side as &quot;heroes&quot; and dress up as them. In 2024 (during the Israel–Hamas war) the most popular Purim costume for children in Israel was an IDF soldier. The Jerusalem Post reported a &quot;trend towards choosing real-life heroes over fictional ones&quot; to dress up as for Purim. The IDF costumes were controversial in the Jewish diaspora.

== International opinions ==
=== Human rights organizations ===

According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;Major Palestinian armed groups, including Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas, have publicly disavowed the use of children in military operations, but those stated policies have not always been implemented. Some leaders, including representatives of Islamic Jihad and Hamas, have said that they consider children of 16 to be adults. International law defines a child as any person under the age of eighteen. [...] Israeli government policy in the Occupied Territories defines Palestinians under the age of 16 as minors while Israeli children in the same territories are considered minors until they reach the age of 18&quot;.

According to Amnesty International, &quot;Palestinian armed groups have repeatedly shown total disregard for the most fundamental human rights, notably the right to life, by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and by using Palestinian children in armed attacks. Children are susceptible to recruitment by manipulation or may be driven to join armed groups for a variety of reasons, including a desire to avenge relatives or friends killed by the Israeli army&quot;.

=== Views of foreign academics ===

According to emeritus professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Vamik Volkan, &quot;Most suicide bombers in the Middle East are chosen as teenagers, &quot;educated&quot;, and then sent off to perform their duty when they are in their late teens or early to mid-twenties. The &quot;education&quot; is most effective when religious elements of the large-group identity are provided as solutions for the personal sense of helplessness, shame, and humiliation&quot;. Volkan gives the examples of beatings, torture, or the loss of a parent as typical humiliating events that might make a young person more susceptible to recruitment for suicide terrorism.

Anne Speckhard, an academic who studies Psychiatry at Georgetown University and the Free University of Brussels, says there is a &quot;cult of martyrdom&quot; in Palestinian society.

<text>Jan Brokoff, also known as Johann Brokoff, (23 June 1652 – 28 December 1718) was a baroque-era sculptor and carver.

Brokoff was of Carpathian German origin, born in Georgenberg, Royal Hungary today Spišská Sobota in Slovakia, and later working and living in Bohemia. He was the father of the sculptors Michael Brokoff and Ferdinand Brokoff.

In 1675, Brokoff moved from Hungary and worked at various places mainly in western Bohemia. Three years later, in 1692 he settled in Prague and gained burgher rights in Prague&#x27;s Staré město (Old Town). He and his wife Elisabeth () born Spingler had four children–sons, Michal Jan Josef, Ferdinand Maxmilian and Antonin Sebastian, and a daughter, Anna Eleonora. Two of the sons continued in his work (and the younger, Ferdinand Maxmilian, becoming the more prominent), the third son, Antonín Sebastian, later became the court poet in Vienna. Jan Brokoff died in Prague.

==Work==

The works attributed to him are of two kinds: some he made himself, others he only designed and let his son Ferdinand actually make them. Brokoff created the statuary of &quot;Lamenting of the Christ&quot; (Czech: &quot;Pieta&quot;) placed on the Charles Bridge in 1695, however this sculpture has been later (1859) moved to the Monastery of the Gracious Sisters of Charles Borromei (Sorores Misericordiae Congregationis S. Caroli Borromei) under the Petřín Hill in Prague.

Other notable pieces include: a wooden model of the statue of John of Nepomuk, according to which the bronze statue, that is now on Charles Bridge, has been cast, statues of &quot;St. Joseph&quot; and &quot;Christening of the Lord&quot; on Charles Bridge (both have been damaged during the revolution days in 1848 and today can be found in the lapidarium of the National Museum in Prague) and many other plastics around Bohemia such as the sculpture in the church of St. Barbara in Manětín or statues which decorate castles and chateaux in Klášterec nad Ohří, Červený Hrádek Chateau near Jirkov, Libochovice, Broumov Monastery, etc.

<text>Indoor cricket is a variant of and shares many basic concepts with cricket. The game is most often played between two teams each consisting of six or eight players.

Several versions of the game have been in existence since the late 1960s, whilst the game in its present form began to take shape in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The codified sport of indoor cricket is not to be confused with conventional cricket played indoors, or with other modified versions of cricket played indoors (see other forms of indoor cricket below).

==The game of cricket==
In terms of the concept of the game indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin, indoor cricket involves two batters, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler &quot;bowls&quot; the ball to the batters who must score runs. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its traditional counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained.

==International rules overview==

===Safety gear===
As a minimum, every male player, including the fielders have to wear an abdominal guard (box), with the person bowling the ball as an exception.
The batsman are required to use batting gloves, primarily for preventing the bat from slipping out of the hands. Indoor batting gloves are readily available at cricket stores, however some indoor cricket facilities also provide basic non-slip gloves that can be shared during the game.Some players prefer to use hard ball batting gloves to prevent their hands from serious injury, as the indoor cricket ball can cause serious damage.

One optional security gadget is safety goggles to prevent any serious injury to the eyes. As the game speed is usually very fast and the play rigorous, it is a demanding cardiovascular activity. It is recommended to have a doctor checkup before taking up indoor cricket, especially in advance age and/or with any medical conditions. It&#x27;s fielders right of way when a shot is played, so the batsman/fielder has to be watchful to avoid collisions.Indoor cricket causes more sporting injuries than casual outdoor cricket, due to the proximity of the ball and fielders. Therefore, a sports/team insurance is important.Some indoor sports facilities provide these insurances as part of the indoor tournaments.

===Playing arena===

The length of an indoor cricket pitch is the same as a conventional cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting.Whilst the pitch is the same length, however, the batters do not have to run the entire length.The striker&#x27;s crease is in the regulation place in front of the stumps, but the non-striker&#x27;s crease is only halfway down the pitch.

===Players===
Indoor cricket is played between 2 teams of 8 players. Each player must bowl 2 eight ball overs, and bat in a partnership for 4 overs.A faster version of the game exists, where each side is reduced to 6 players and each innings lasts 12 overs instead of 16.

===Equipment===
The stumps used in indoor cricket are not, for obvious reasons, stuck in the ground. Instead, they are collapsible spring-loaded stumps that immediately spring back to the standing position when knocked over. The ball used in indoor cricket is a modified cricket ball, with a softer centre.The ball also differs in that it is yellow to make it more obvious to see indoors against varied backgrounds. Both traditional outdoor cricket bats or more specialised lighter-weight indoor cricket bats may be used. The gloves are typically lightweight cotton with no protective padding on the outside.The palm-side of the gloves usually have embedded rubber dots to aid grip.

===Scoring===
Scoring in indoor cricket is divided into 4 types: physical runs, bonus runs, the usual extras/sundries, and penalty-minus runs.Physical runs are scored by both batters completing a run from one crease to the other.Bonus runs are scored when the ball hits a net.Bonus scores for particular parts of the nets follow:
*Zone A (front net – behind the keeper): 0 runs
*Zone B (side nets between the striker&#x27;s end and halfway down the pitch): 1 run
*Zone C (side nets between halfway and the bowler&#x27;s end): 2 runs
*Zone D (back net – behind the bowler): 4 or 6 runs depending on how the ball hit the back net.
**On the bounce: 4 runs
**On the full: 6 runs 
*Zone B or C onto Zone D: 3 runs
NB: For bonus runs to be scored, at least one physical run must be scored. The bonus runs are then added to the physical runs.For example, a batsman strikes the ball, hits the back net on the full (6), and he/she makes one physical run, for a total of 7 runs.
Extras/sundries are the same as those in formal cricket and consist of wides, no-balls etcetera.
Penalty-minus runs are the set number of runs deducted from a team&#x27;s score for each dismissal.

===Dismissals===
A batsman can be dismissed in the same ways they can be in conventional cricket – with variations in the case of LBW and mankad (see below) – and with the exception of &quot;timed out&quot;. When a batsman gets dismissed, however, five runs are deducted from their total and they continue to bat.Batters bat in pairs for 4 overs at a time, irrespective of whether they are dismissed. A player can also be &quot;caught&quot; by a ball rebounding off a net, except off a &quot;six&quot;, as long as it has not previously touched the ground. This negates any physical or bonus runs that might have been awarded.

A method of dismissal in indoor cricket that is far more prevalent than its outdoor counterpart is the mankad.A mankad is given out if the bowler completes their bowling action without releasing the ball, breaks the stumps at their end without letting go of the ball and the non-striker is out of their ground.

Whilst lbw is a valid form of dismissal in indoor cricket, it is a far rarer occurrence in indoor than it is in outdoor cricket.A batsman can only be dismissed lbw if he does not offer a shot and the umpire is satisfied that the ball would then have hit the stumps.

===Officials===
Indoor cricket is officiated by one umpire who is situated outside of the playing area at the strike batters&#x27; end of the court. The umpire sits or stands on a raised platform that is usually 3 metres above ground level. Secondary officials (such as scorers or video umpires) have sometimes been utilised in national or international competition.

===Result===
The team with the higher score at the conclusion of each innings is declared the winner of the match. The second innings continues for a full 16 overs even if the batting side passes the first innings total due to the possibility of a side finishing behind a total even after they have surpassed it (see dismissals above).

In most cases indoor cricket is played according to a skins system, where the batting partnerships from each innings are compared against one another and the higher of the two is deemed to have won the skin. For example, the second batting partnership in the first innings might score 5 runs whilst the second partnership in the second innings scores 10 – the latter would be deemed to have won the skin. The team that has won the greater of the four skins available is often awarded the win if the totals are tied.

== 3 Dot balls Rule ==
Most indoor cricket centres employ a dot ball rule, where the scoreboard has to change at least every third ball. This means if the batters play 2 consecutive balls without a change in the scorecard (applies on multiple batters over multiple overs), the scorecard has to change on the 3rd ball. It can be changed by batsman scoring a run, extra runs or in the case where a run is not scored on the 3rd consecutive ball, the batsman is declared out and 5 runs deducted off the score, hence changing the scorecard.

===Jackpot ball Rule===
Some indoor leagues have the first or last ball of a &#x27;Skin&#x27; declared a jackpot ball. This means any runs scored on the jackpot ball will be doubled. e.g. if a &#x27;7&#x27; is hit, it will counted as 14 runs and if a wicket is lost, it will be counted as minus 10 runs.

==Types of match and competition==

Indoor cricket is typically played either as a six- or eight-a-side match, and with six- or eight-ball overs respectively. The game can be played in men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and mixed competitions. Permutations of the game include bonus overs (where the bonus score is double, dismissals result in seven (7) runs (cf. five (5) runs) being deducted from the team score and fielding restrictions removed.)

===Test Match===
Test indoor cricket is the highest standard of indoor cricket and is played between members of the World Indoor Cricket Federation.

The first international Test matches were played between Australia and New Zealand in 1985. Those sides have since been joined on the international stage by England (1990), South Africa (1991), Zimbabwe (1998), Namibia (1998), India (2000), Pakistan (2000), Sri Lanka (2002), United Arab Emirates (2004), Wales (2007), France (2007), Guernsey (2007), Singapore (2013), Malaysia (2017).

Test matches are usually played in a group of matches called a &quot;series&quot; featuring two to four nations. These series can consist of three to five matches and where more than two nations are involved, may also include a finals series. Matches played at World Cup events are also considered Test matches.

International competition is also organised for juniors and masters age groups. The matches are considered Test matches within their respective divisions.

Since 1985, most Test series between Australia and New Zealand have played for the Trans Tasman trophy. Similarly, since 1990, Test series between Australia and England have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes, a name borrowed from the trophy contested by the same nations in outdoor cricket.

===National championships===
Each member nation of the WICF usually holds its own national titles. In Australia, states and territories compete in the Australian Indoor Cricket Championships (as well as the now defunct National League).

The national competition in New Zealand is referred to as the Tri Series and is contested by three provinces – Northern, Central and Southern.

National championships contested elsewhere in the world include South Africa&#x27;s National Championship and England&#x27;s National League.

===Minor Competition===
In addition to social competition played throughout the world there are several state leagues and competitions within each nation. Various states, provinces or geographical areas organise their own state championships (referred to in Australia as &quot;Superleague&quot; – not to be confused with the ill-fated Rugby League competition). Various districts, centres or arenas take part in these competitions including the Rec Club Miranda which is one of Sydney&#x27;s oldest indoor cricket centres.

===World Cup===

The Indoor Cricket World cup was first held in Birmingham, England in 1995 and has run every two or three years since. The event usually also features age-group, masters&#x27; and women&#x27;s competitions. The last World Cup was held in Wellington (NZ) in October 2014. Australia came first in the boys&#x27;, girls&#x27;, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s competitions. Australia has won all 9 Open Men World Cup titles (since 1995) and all 8 Open World Cup titles (since 1998).

==Origin and development of indoor cricket==
The first significant example of organised indoor cricket took place, somewhat unusually, in Germany. A tournament was held under the auspices of the Husum Cricket Club in a hall in Flensburg in the winter of 1968–69.

It was not until the 1970s that the game began to take shape as a codified sport. Conceived as a way of keeping cricketers involved during the winter months, various six-a-side leagues were formed throughout England in the first half of the decade, eventually leading to the first national competition held in March 1976 at the Sobell Center in Islington. This distinct form of indoor cricket is still played today.

Despite the early popularity of the sport in England, a different version of indoor cricket developed by two different parties in Perth, Western Australia in the late 1970s evolved into the sport known as indoor cricket today. Against the backdrop of the upheaval in the conventional game caused by World Series Cricket, torrential rain and a desire to keep their charges active led cricket school administrators Dennis Lillee and Graeme Monaghan to set up netted arenas indoors. Concurrently, entrepreneurs Paul Hanna and Michael Jones began creating an eight-a-side game that eventually led to the nationwide franchise known as Indoor Cricket Arenas (ICA). It was not long before hundreds of ICA-branded stadiums were set up throughout Australia, leading to the first national championships held in 1984 at a time where over 200,000 people were estimated to be participating in the sport.

The sport underwent several organisational changes, most notably in Australia and in South Africa (where competing organisations fought for control of the sport), but the game has changed little since that time and has risen in popularity in several nations. Under the auspices of the World Indoor Cricket Federation the sport has reached a point where is played according to the same standard rules in major competitions throughout the world.

==International structure of indoor cricket==
The World Indoor Cricket Federation is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded prior to the 1995 World Cup by representatives from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England.

Nations may either be full members or associate members of the WICF. Each member nation has its own national body which regulates matches played in its country. The national bodies are responsible for selecting representatives for its national side and organising home and away internationals for the side.

==Other forms of indoor cricket==

===Conventional cricket indoors===

Conventional cricket matches have taken place at covered venues (usually featuring a retractable roof) and can thus be regarded as cricket being played indoors, such as Docklands Stadium in Melbourne, Australia. Such matches are relatively infrequent and come with added complications in the event that the ball makes contact with the roof while in play.

===UK variant===

A version of indoor cricket (bearing greater resemblance to conventional cricket) is played exclusively in the United Kingdom. This variant sees the six players on each team utilise the same playing and protective equipment that can be found in outdoor cricket, and is played in indoor facilities that differ greatly from the international form of indoor cricket.

Despite lacking international competition, this form of indoor cricket enjoys a strong following in the UK, and, like its international counterpart, enjoys the support of the ECB.

<doc id="554120" wikidata="Q3274323" url="?curid=554120" title="Whitby-class frigate">
<text>The Type 12 or &quot;Whitby&quot;-class frigates were a six-ship class of anti-submarine frigates of the Royal Navy, which entered service late in the 1950s. They were designed in the early 1950s as first-rate ocean-going convoy escorts, in the light of experience gained during World War II. At this time, the Royal Navy were designing single-role escorts and the &quot;Whitby&quot;s were designed as fast convoy escorts capable of tackling high-speed submarines. However, this made the &quot;Whitby&quot;s more expensive and sophisticated to produce in large numbers in the event of a major war, and so the Type 14 &quot;utility&quot; or &quot;second-rate&quot; anti-submarine frigate was developed to complement the Type 12. Although themselves rapidly outdated, the Type 12 proved to be an excellent basis for a series of frigate designs used by the British and Commonwealth navies for the next 20 years.

==Design==
Critical to the design of the Type 12 was the capability to steam for long periods of time in heavy seas, economically and at high speed. For this reason a novel hull form was devised, which, despite its appearance, was totally unrelated to that of the earlier Type 41 / Type 61 design. The hull showed the fine lines more typical of a destroyer, but had a raised forecastle with considerable flare. The forecastle deck was level to maintain maximum freeboard aft of the stem where it is most likely that waves will break across the deck. These two features meant that the hull not only cut through the water, but that spray was thrown upwards and outwards, away from the bridge and gun turret. This was especially important in high latitudes where war experience had shown that spray could cause rapid and undesirable ice build-up on the forecastle. The deck edges and hull also met at a curve rather than an angle, the anchors were recessed, and protrusions were kept to a minimum to limit the potential sources of ice build-up and spray generation. The Mark 6 gunhouse was large and heavy, so had to be carried low to maintain stability and give a good view over it from the bridge. The forecastle therefore had a very distinctive kink, allowing the position of the guns to be lowered. This had the added benefit of moving the bridge aft, where there was considerably less motion, improving the lot of the watchkeeper. The hull form, coupled with a twin-shaft double-reduction geared steam turbine plant (the Y-100) that operated at high temperature and pressure (for efficiency) and low revolutions, with new five-bladed low-cavitation propellers (for efficiency and quietness) lent themselves to the perfect hull for a high-speed, all-weather anti-submarine vessel.

Experience with the Type 15 frigate program, rebuilding wartime destroyers into fast anti-submarine frigates, had led to the adoption of a bridge design characteristic of Royal Navy escorts up to the of 1969. The covered bridge, where the ship was conned, was located above the operations room where the ship was fought, and there was a small pilot&#x27;s position located to the front of the bridge, giving the indicative &quot;T&quot; shape when viewed from above. &quot;Whitby&quot; was unique in that her bridge face was vertical, her sisters having the windows mounted at an angle to the face, to cut down on internal reflections inside the bridge in low-light. There was also an open navigation bridge located above and behind the enclosed one.

The original funnel was a straight, cylindrical affair that was designed to resist a nuclear blast, but this was prone to down-draughting and did not clear the hot exhaust gasses particularly well. It was replaced by a heightened, raked, streamlined version with a characteristic domed top. This was incorporated in later build vessels, and in all of the subsequent . Only &quot;Scarborough&quot; retained the stubby vertical funnel throughout her career.

==Armament==
The armament was based around two Limbo Mark 10 anti-submarine mortars. This allowed a three-bomb salvo to be placed both above and below the target, creating a convergent pressure wave more likely to assure a kill. The Limbos were mounted in a well on the quarterdeck, with a 360° arc of fire. Again, wartime experience had shown that the quarterdeck, perhaps not an obvious location for an ahead throwing weapon, was indeed the best location for such weapons where they were out of the spray towards the front of the vessel. The Limbo mortars were controlled by three sonars, the Type 174 search set, Type 162 target classification set and the Type 170 &#x27;pencil beam&#x27; targeting set. The lattice foremast carried the Type 293Q target indication set and the Type 974 navigation set, and a Type 277Q height finder was carried on a stump mast between the bridge and the mainmast. These sets were all derived from units of Second World War vintage.

Carrying the Limbos aft allowed the forecastle to be left clear for the twin 4.5in Mark 6 gun for anti-surface and limited anti-aircraft fire, controlled by a Mark 6M director with Type 285 radar mounted behind the bridge. Further anti-submarine capability was to be afforded by twelve 21-inch Mark 20E &quot;Bidder&quot; anti-submarine homing torpedoes, carried in fixed tubes; Four pairs were fixed firing forward on either beam, with a trainable pair behind these on each side. Ultimately the E (for &quot;Escort&quot; vessels) version of the Mark 20 torpedo was a failure as it was not nearly fast enough to catch its intended target, and the tubes were removed (in those cases where they had been fitted at all) and the torpedoes never deployed.

Self-defence against aircraft was provided by the elaborate STAAG weapon, a complex and ultimately failed exercise in engineering. The STAAG (Stabilised Tachymetric Anti-Aircraft Gun), consisted of two Bofors 40 mm L/60 guns, the radar Type 262 fire control set and a tachymetric computer. All this was carried on a common, stabilised, powered-operated gun mounting. Intended to function much as the modern close-in weapon system does, this weapon was ahead of the limits of technology at the time; it was overweight and overly complex and its sensitive valve electronics were a maintenance nightmare. Ultimately STAAG would be replaced by a simple and ubiquitous Bofors 40 mm gun on the single Mark 7 mounting.

==Service==
The &quot;Whitby&quot;s served up until the 1970s, when increasing age and defence economies led to their gradual withdrawal or reassignment. In 1966, &quot;Blackpool&quot; was loaned to the Royal New Zealand Navy, while they waited for the delivery of , a &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate. It would remain in New Zealand service until 1971 when it returned to the Royal Navy, and decommissioned that same year. All other ships, except &quot;Eastbourne&quot; and , were decommissioned in the 1970s. The latter two ships were decommissioned in 1984 and 1985 respectively. &quot;Scarborough&quot; and &quot;Tenby&quot; were intended to have been sold to Pakistan, but the country could not afford the refits required for the two ships, and thus the sale was cancelled. &quot;Blackpool&quot; was decommissioned for use as a target vessel in the Firth of Forth. After HMS &quot;Eastbourne&quot; was rammed in the Third Cod War in 1976, structural damage prevented further sea service, although the frigate and its steam turbines were still in good condition and &quot;Eastbourne&quot; became an engine room training ship alongside at at Rosyth. &quot;Torquay&quot; was modified and fitted with Computer Assisted Action Information System (CAAIS) for use as a trials and training ship.

==Construction programme==

In 1959 Triang Minic Ships produced a series of 1:1200 (one inch to 100 feet) metal models of Type 12 frigates, carrying the names Whitby, Tenby, Torquay and Blackpool. These toys were mass-produced in large numbers between 1959 and 1965, and remain sought after by collectors today. At the same time the Frog (models) company produced an accurate plastic model kit of a Type 12 frigate to a scale of 1:500. The moulds for this were sold to Russia in 1976, and it has been re-issued under the &quot;Novo&quot; trademark on several occasions.

<text>The Daubechies wavelets, based on the work of Ingrid Daubechies, are a family of orthogonal wavelets defining a discrete wavelet transform and characterized by a maximal number of vanishing moments for some given support. With each wavelet type of this class, there is a scaling function (called the &quot;father wavelet&quot;) which generates an orthogonal multiresolution analysis.

==Properties==

In general the Daubechies wavelets are chosen to have the highest number &quot;A&quot; of vanishing moments, (this does not imply the best smoothness) for given support width (number of coefficients) 2&quot;A&quot;. There are two naming schemes in use, D&quot;N&quot; using the length or number of taps, and db&quot;A&quot; referring to the number of vanishing moments. So D4 and db2 are the same wavelet transform.

Among the 2&quot;A&quot;−1 possible solutions of the algebraic equations for the moment and orthogonality conditions, the one is chosen whose scaling filter has extremal phase. The wavelet transform is also easy to put into practice using the fast wavelet transform. Daubechies wavelets are widely used in solving a broad range of problems, e.g. self-similarity properties of a signal or fractal problems, signal discontinuities, etc.

The Daubechies wavelets are not defined in terms of the resulting scaling and wavelet functions; in fact, they are not possible to write down in closed form. The graphs below are generated using the cascade algorithm, a numeric technique consisting of inverse-transforming [1 0 0 0 0 ... ] an appropriate number of times.
Note that the spectra shown here are not the frequency response of the high and low pass filters, but rather the amplitudes of the continuous Fourier transforms of the scaling (blue) and wavelet (red) functions.

Daubechies orthogonal wavelets D2–D20 resp. db1–db10 are commonly used. Each wavelet has a number of &quot;zero moments&quot; or &quot;vanishing moments&quot; equal to half the number of coefficients. For example, D2 has one vanishing moment, D4 has two, etc. A vanishing moment limits the wavelets ability to represent polynomial behaviour or information in a signal. For example, D2, with one vanishing moment, easily encodes polynomials of one coefficient, or constant signal components. D4 encodes polynomials with two coefficients, i.e. constant and linear signal components; and D6 encodes 3-polynomials, i.e. constant, linear and quadratic signal components. This ability to encode signals is nonetheless subject to the phenomenon of &quot;scale leakage&quot;, and the lack of shift-invariance, which arise from the discrete shifting operation (below) during application of the transform. Sub-sequences which represent linear, quadratic (for example) signal components are treated differently by the transform depending on whether the points align with even- or odd-numbered locations in the sequence. The lack of the important property of shift-invariance, has led to the development of several different versions of a shift-invariant (discrete) wavelet transform.

==Construction==
Both the scaling sequence (low-pass filter) and the wavelet sequence (band-pass filter) (see orthogonal wavelet for details of this construction) will here be normalized to have sum equal 2 and sum of squares equal 2. In some applications, they are normalised to have sum formula_1, so that both sequences and all shifts of them by an even number of coefficients are orthonormal to each other.

Using the general representation for a scaling sequence of an orthogonal discrete wavelet transform with approximation order &quot;A&quot;,

:formula_2

with &quot;N&quot; = 2&quot;A&quot;, &quot;p&quot; having real coefficients, &quot;p&quot;(1) = 1 and deg(&quot;p&quot;) = &quot;A&quot; − 1, one can write the orthogonality condition as

:formula_3

or equally as

:formula_4

with the Laurent-polynomial

:formula_5

generating all symmetric sequences and formula_6 Further, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) stands for the symmetric Laurent-polynomial

:formula_7

Since

:formula_8 
:formula_9

&quot;P&quot; takes nonnegative values on the segment [0,2].

Equation (*) has one minimal solution for each &quot;A&quot;, which can be obtained by division in the ring of truncated power series in &quot;X&quot;,

:formula_10

Obviously, this has positive values on (0,2).

The homogeneous equation for (*) is antisymmetric about &quot;X&quot; = 1 and has thus the general solution

:formula_11

with &quot;R&quot; some polynomial with real coefficients. That the sum

:formula_12

shall be nonnegative on the interval [0,2] translates into a set of linear restrictions on the coefficients of &quot;R&quot;. The values of &quot;P&quot; on the interval [0,2] are bounded by some quantity formula_13 maximizing &quot;r&quot; results in a linear program with infinitely many inequality conditions.

To solve

:formula_14

for &quot;p&quot; one uses a technique called spectral factorization resp. Fejér-Riesz-algorithm. The polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) splits into linear factors

:formula_15

Each linear factor represents a Laurent-polynomial

:formula_16

that can be factored into two linear factors. One can assign either one of the two linear factors to &quot;p&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;), thus one obtains 2&quot;N&quot; possible solutions. For extremal phase one chooses the one that has all complex roots of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;) inside or on the unit circle and is thus real.

For Daubechies wavelet transform, a pair of linear filters is used. Each filter of the pair should be a quadrature mirror filter. Solving the coefficient of the linear filter formula_17 using the quadrature mirror filter property results in the following solution for the coefficient values for filter of order 4.

:formula_18

== The scaling sequences of lowest approximation order ==

Below are the coefficients for the scaling functions for D2-20. The wavelet coefficients are derived by reversing the order of the scaling function coefficients and then reversing the sign of every second one, (i.e., D4 wavelet formula_19 {−0.1830127, −0.3169873, 1.1830127, −0.6830127}). Mathematically, this looks like formula_20 where &quot;k&quot; is the coefficient index, &quot;b&quot; is a coefficient of the wavelet sequence and &quot;a&quot; a coefficient of the scaling sequence. &quot;N&quot; is the wavelet index, i.e., 2 for D2.

Parts of the construction are also used to derive the biorthogonal Cohen–Daubechies–Feauveau wavelets (CDFs).

==Implementation==
While software such as Mathematica supports Daubechies wavelets directly a basic implementation is possible in MATLAB (in this case, Daubechies 4). This implementation uses periodization to handle the problem of finite length signals. Other, more sophisticated methods are available, but often it is not necessary to use these as it only affects the very ends of the transformed signal. The periodization is accomplished in the forward transform directly in MATLAB vector notation, and the inverse transform by using the codice_1 function:

===Transform, D4===
It is assumed that &quot;S&quot;, a column vector with an even number of elements, has been pre-defined as the signal to be analyzed. Note that the D4 coefficients are [1 + , 3 + , 3 − , 1 − ]/4.
N = length(S);
sqrt3 = sqrt(3);
s_odd = S(1:2:N-1);
s_even = S(2:2:N);

s = (sqrt3+1)*s_odd + (3+sqrt3)*s_even + (3-sqrt3)*[s_odd(2:N/2);s_odd(1)] + (1-sqrt3)*[s_even(2:N/2);s_even(1)];
d = (1-sqrt3)*[s_odd(N/2);s_odd(1:N/2-1)] + (sqrt3-3)*[s_even(N/2);s_even(1:N/2-1)] + (3+sqrt3)*s_odd + (-1-sqrt3)*s_even
s = s / (4*sqrt(2));
d = d / (4*sqrt(2));
===Inverse transform, D4===

d1 = d * ((sqrt(3) - 1) / sqrt(2));
s2 = s * ((sqrt(3) + 1) / sqrt(2));
s1 = s2 + circshift(d1, - 1);
S(2:2:N) = d1 + sqrt(3) / 4 * s1 + (sqrt(3) - 2) / 4 * circshift(s1, 1);
S(1:2:N - 1) = s1 - sqrt(3) * S(2:2:N);
==Binomial-QMF==
It was shown by Ali Akansu in 1990 that the binomial quadrature mirror filter bank (binomial QMF) is identical to the Daubechies wavelet filter, and its performance was ranked among known subspace solutions from a discrete-time signal processing perspective. It was an extension of the prior work on binomial coefficient and Hermite polynomials that led to the development of the Modified Hermite Transformation (MHT) in 1987. The magnitude square functions of Binomial-QMF filters are the unique maximally flat functions in a two-band perfect reconstruction QMF (PR-QMF) design formulation that is related to the wavelet regularity in the continuous domain.

==Applications==
* The application of Daubechies wavelet transform as a watermarking scheme has been proved effective. This approach operates in a proficient multi-resolution frequency domain, enabling the incorporation of an encrypted digital logo in the format of QR codes.
* Daubechies wavelet approximation can be used to analyze Griffith crack behavior in nonlocal magneto-elastic horizontally shear (SH) wave propagation within a finite-thickness, infinitely long homogeneous isotropic strip.
* Daubechies wavelet cepstral coefficients can be useful in the context of Parkinson&#x27;s disease detection. Daubechies wavelets, known for their efficient multi-resolution analysis, are utilized to extract cepstral features from vocal signal data. These wavelet-based coefficients can act as discriminative features for accurately identifying patterns indicative of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, offering a novel approach to diagnostic methodologies.
* When it comes to analysis and detection of Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Complex Daubechies wavelets can be used to identify intricate details of the CAP affected areas in infected lungs to produce accurate results.
* The elastohydrodynamic lubrication problem involves the study of lubrication regimes in which the deformation of the contacting surfaces significantly influences the lubricating film. Daubechies wavelets can address the challenges associated with accurately modeling and simulating such intricate lubrication phenomena. Daubechies wavelets allows for a more detailed and refined exploration of the interactions between the lubricant and the contacting surfaces.
* Daubechies Wavelet can extract intricate details and features from the vibroacoustic signals, offering a comprehensive diagnostic approach for evaluating the condition and performance of diesel engines in combine harvesters. The Daubechies Wavelet spectrum serves as a powerful analytical tool, allowing the researchers to identify patterns, anomalies, and characteristic signatures within the signals associated with different engine conditions. This detailed spectral analysis aids in enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic assessments, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the vibrational and acoustic characteristics indicative of engine health or potential issues.
* In practical terms, the Daubechies wavelets facilitate a finely tuned examination of the temporal and spatial characteristics of dynamic waves within elastic materials. This approach enables a more nuanced understanding of how elastic solids respond to varying dynamic conditions over time. The integration of Daubechies wavelets into the finite wavelet domain method likely contributes to a more versatile and robust analytical framework for studying transient dynamic waves in elastic solids.
* The brachistochrone problem can be formulated and expressed as a variational problem, emphasizing the importance of finding the optimal curve that minimizes the time of descent. By introducing Daubechies wavelets into the mathematical framework, scaling functions associated with these wavelets can construct an approximation of the optimal curve. Daubechies wavelets, with their ability to capture both high and low-frequency components of a function, prove instrumental in achieving a detailed representation of the brachistochrone curve.

<text>Mohammad Yousuf PP SI (Punjabi, ; formerly Yousuf Youhana, ; born 27 August 1974) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer and captain, who played all three formats. Prior to his conversion to Islam, Yousuf was one of the few Christians to play for the Pakistan national cricket team. Yousuf scored 1,788 runs in 2006 which is a world record for most runs scored in a year in tests at an average of almost 100. He was a part of the Pakistan squad which finished as runners-up at the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

Yousuf was banned from playing international cricket for Pakistan by the Pakistan Cricket Board on 10 March 2010, following an inquiry into the team&#x27;s defeats during the tour of Australia. An official statement was released by the Pakistan Cricket Board, saying that he would not be selected again because he had created disciplinary problems and infighting within the team.

In reaction to the ban, Yousuf announced his retirement from international cricket on 29 March 2010. However, following Pakistan&#x27;s disastrous first Test against England in July/August 2010, PCB decided to ask Yousuf to come out of retirement.

==Early life==
Yousuf was born in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan to a Punjabi Christian family. As a boy, he couldn&#x27;t afford cricket gear and played street cricket with his brother&#x27;s taped tennis ball and wooden planks. As a 12-year-old, he was spotted by the Golden Gymkhana, and he subsequently joined Lahore&#x27;s Forman Christian College and continued playing until stopping abruptly in early 1994.

Yousuf, hailing from a poor background, was plucked from the obscurity of a tailor&#x27;s shop in the slums of the eastern city of Lahore to play a local match in the 1990s. His well-crafted shots attracted attention and he rose through the ranks to become one of Pakistan&#x27;s best batsmen.

==Conversion to Islam==
Until his conversion to Islam in 2005, Yousuf was the fourth Christian (and fifth non-Muslim overall) to play for the Pakistan cricket team, following in the footsteps of Wallis Mathias, Antao D&#x27;Souza and the Anglo-Pakistani Duncan Sharpe. He also has the distinction of being the first and so far only non-Muslim to captain the country, leading the team in the 2004–05 tour of Australia where he scored a century in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He converted to Islam after attending regular preaching sessions of the Tablighi Jamaat, Pakistan&#x27;s largest non-political religious grouping, whose preachers include Yousuf&#x27;s former teammate Saeed Anwar and his brother. His wife Tania converted along with him and adopted the Islamic name Fatima. However, the news was kept private for three months due to family reasons as well as his own decision to practice his faith, before his announcement of their conversion publicly in September 2005. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to give Yousuf my name after what he has done&quot;, his mother was quoted as saying by the &quot;Daily Times&quot; newspaper. &quot;We came to know about his decision when he offered Friday prayers at a local mosque. It was a shock&quot;, his mother was reported as saying. However, Yousuf told the BBC that &quot;I cannot tell you what a great feeling it is.&quot; As part of his conversion, Yousuf officially changed his name from Yousuf Youhana to Mohammad Yousuf.

Former Pakistan cricketer, sports commentator &amp; former PCB Chairman Ramiz Raja, who himself is Muslim, acknowledged the significance of Yousuf&#x27;s new faith: &quot;Religion has played an integral part in his growth not just as a cricketer but as a person.&quot;

== International career ==
===Early days===
He made his Test debut against South Africa in Durban and One Day International debut against Zimbabwe in Harare. He has scored over 9,000 One Day International runs at an average above 40 and over 7,000 Test runs at an average above 50 (2nd highest batting average amongst all Pakistani batsmen) with 24 Test centuries. He has the record of scoring the most runs without being dismissed in One Day International matches, with a total of 405 runs against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in 2002–2003. He has also scored a 23-ball fifty and a 68-ball hundred in One Day Internationals. In a Test match, he scored a 27-ball fifty, which is 3rd fastest by any player. He was the top scorer during the successive years of 2002 and 2003 in the world in One Day International match. In 2004, he scored 111 runs against the Australians in the Boxing Day Test. In December 2005, he scored 223 runs against England at Lahore, also earning him the man of the match award. Seven months later in July 2006, when Pakistan toured England, he scored 202 runs and 48 in the first Test, again earning himself the man of the match award. He followed up with 192 in the third Test at Headingley and 128 in the final Test at The Oval.

===Rise in ranks===
Yousuf was named CNN-IBN&#x27;s Cricketer of the Year for 2006, ahead of the likes of Australian captain Ricky Ponting, West Indies Brian Lara, Australian spinner Shane Warne, South Africa&#x27;s bowling spearhead Makhaya Ntini and Sri Lanka&#x27;s Muttiah Muralitharan. He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 2007 edition. Yousuf became the fourth recipient of the ICC &#x27;Test Cricketer of the Year&#x27; award for 2007, he scored 944 runs at an average of 94.40 including seven centuries and two fifties in just 10 innings and that was enough to be awarded the honour ahead of English batsman Kevin Pietersen and Australian batsman Ricky Ponting.

A year that started on a promising note, Yousuf carried it forward to break two world records, both held earlier by former West Indian batsman Viv Richards. The 32-year-old Pakistani batsman achieved an unparalleled 1788 runs in just 10 Test matches with the help of twelve centuries which became his second world record. Yousuf was known for his ability to score runs at exceptional rate through his great technique and composed strokeplay. Although capable of hitting the ball hard, Yousuf was quick between the wickets, although he was prone to being run out.

=== Golden 2006 ===

Statistically, the year 2006 is said to be the year of Australia, Muttiah Muralitharan and Yousuf. Yousuf scored 1788 runs at an average of 99.33 in 2006 and broke two of Viv Richards&#x27;s world records.

On 30 November 2006, during the third innings of the final Test between Pakistan and West Indies at Karachi, he surpassed Viv Richards&#x27;s thirty-year-old record and became the highest scorer in Test matches during a single calendar year. He also broke Zaheer Abbas&#x27;s record for the most runs made by a Pakistani batsman in a three-Test series. Abbas made 583 runs against the visiting Indians in 1978/79. Yousuf hit nine test centuries in 2006, which is a world record for most centuries in a calendar year. Yousuf also equaled the record held by former Australian batsman Donald Bradman, by scoring six centuries in successive Tests – although it took him only four matches compared with Bradman&#x27;s six.

After his 191 at Multan he became the first player in Test history to have been dismissed 3 times in the 190s, with all three innings coming in 2006. For his performances in 2006 and 2007, he was named in the ICC Test Team of the Year. For his performances in 2006, he was named in the World Test XI by ESPNcricinfo.

Yousuf is a skilful infielder, with a report prepared by ESPNcricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the seventh highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman. He is also distinguished by his characteristic celebration after hitting one hundred runs for his country, where he prostrates in thankfulness to Allah in the direction of Mecca. He has observed this act (known as the Sajdah) since his conversion to Islam.

=== Retirement and subsequent return ===
On 29 March 2010, Yousuf announced his retirement from international cricket, two days after the Pakistan Cricket Board imposed an indefinite ban on him. &quot;I received a letter from the PCB that my staying in the team is harmful for the team, so I announce my retirement from international cricket&quot;, he said at a press conference in Karachi. On 27 March, Yousuf said that he had decided to retire from international cricket. &quot;Yes, I have decided to retire as Pakistan player and my decision is not an emotional one&quot;, Yousuf told press agency AFP, &quot;It&#x27;s of no use playing if my playing is harmful to the team&quot;. He was placed under an indefinite ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board for his disciplinary problems on Pakistan&#x27;s tour of Australia 2009–2010.

On 1 August 2010, after Pakistan lost the first Test match against England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, Yousuf was called back in the squad for the rest of the series. He decided not to play the second Test because of tiredness and jet lag. Shortly after the completion of the second test, Pakistani captain Salman Butt announced that he expected Yousuf to return for the third test. The selectors decided to play Yousuf in a tour match against Worcestershire just before the third Test so that his form and fitness could be checked. Yousuf&#x27;s form check was positive, because on a day inflicted by rain he managed to score 40*. Yousuf then scored 56 against England in the third Test before being caught and bowled by Graeme Swann; in the process Yousuf became Swann&#x27;s 100th casualty in Test cricket;the day saw a much improved performance by Pakistan as they were eventually bowled out for 308.

In the same tour of England that summer, he participated in the Twenty20 series as well. Despite being considered an &quot;old boys cricketer&quot; and having participated in only a sole T20I in 2006 and considered one who does not slog as often (notable by the low number of sixes he has scored), Yousuf participated and scored 26 off 21 deliveries.

His return continued well when he scored 46 in the second ODI against England. He consistently scored during the five-match England series as Pakistan lost 3–2. Yousuf was subsequently called up to play for Pakistan in all three formats against South Africa in October 2010; however he was not selected for any of the matches.

==Controversy==
In 2007, after initially signing a contract to join the Indian Cricket League, Yousuf refused due to pressure from the Pakistan Cricket Board as he would later face a ban by the board. In return the PCB promised to get him into the Indian Premier League; however, no team bid for him as he faced litigation from the ICL.

In 2008, he once again threatened to join the ICL after the PCB dropped him from their squad. A PCB official was quoted as saying, &quot;We have banned all our cricketers who joined the ICL and if Yousuf also plays for the unauthorised league then he will have to face the same punishment. Yousuf is still our best Test batsman and has a future with the Pakistan team, but not if he joins the ICL.&quot; Yousuf decided to join the ICL again to play mid-way through the second season. The Pakistan Cricket Board reacted to the news by banning him from the national team. Yousaf&#x27;s chances of returning to Pakistani cricket improved on 2 February 2009 when a Pakistani court suspended the ban on ICL players.

Pakistan Cricket Board recalled batsman Mohammad Yousuf to the squad for their July 2009 Test series in Sri Lanka. Yousuf ended his association with the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League (ICL) in early May, in the hope of earning a recall for his country. His decision to join the ICL was made because of differences with former captain Shoaib Malik, who had since been replaced by Younus Khan. In July 2009, on his first match after returning to Test Cricket since 2007, Yousuf scored a century to announce his return to cricket.

Yousuf informed the Pakistan Cricket Board that he would not be taking part in the Champions Trophy 2008 because it would coincide with the holy month of Ramadan.

He along with another former Indian Cricket League player Abdul Razzaq were awarded &#x27;A&#x27; category mid-term central contracts by Pakistan Cricket Board after they left Indian Cricket League. A little over one year after being welcomed back by the PCB, Yousuf was made captain of the Test team for the tour of New Zealand after Younus Khan was allowed to take a break.

The Pakistan Cricket Board, on 10 March 2010, banned Yousuf and former captain, Younis Khan from playing for the national team indefinitely and imposed one-year bans on Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan. Despite receiving the ban Yousuf said that the series against South Africa in late 2010 could be a possibility. Pakistan then toured England in July 2010 and after losing the first test by 354 runs due to a weak batting line-up, the second innings total of 80 being the lowest total by Pakistan against England. Yousuf announced his return to International Cricket and was placed on the squad. He then required a visa which was granted but there was a concern that Yousuf could not come to England in time for that tour.

Yousuf captained his domestic team, the Lahore Lions, to victory in the 2010–11 Faysal Bank Twenty-20 Cup; the team defeated the Karachi Dolphins in the final. That was also the first time in five years that the trophy had gone to someone besides the Sialkot Stallions. Yousuf was given the award of fielder of the series. He did however injure his hamstring in training for the series against South Africa in October 2010. Chief Selector Mohsin Khan elected to withdraw Yousuf from the ODI and T20I squads but said that he should be ready to play in the Test match series. Yousuf&#x27;s replacement in the limited-overs squad was Younis Khan, who had successfully reconciled with the Pakistan Cricket Board. He managed to regain his fitness and participated in the two-match Test series against South Africa. Also, he managed to regain his fitness quickly enough to participate in the final ODI of the five-match series. Yousuf wore a shirt which had his name written on in ink, which was against regulations. The match-referee called him and Yousuf stated that because he came for the test series he did not bring coloured clothing because he did not think that he would play. Subsequently, the ICC cleared him of any wrongdoing. Minutes before the toss in the first Test match, Yousuf picked up a groin injury. The injury took two weeks to heal and subsequently Yousuf missed the two-match Test series. Amid his recent spate of injuries, former Pakistan captain Moin Khan suggested that Yousuf should retire from ODIs and T20s and focus on Tests only due to age and consistent injuries.

In January 2012 it was announced that Yousuf was holding talks with Leicestershire over becoming their overseas player for 2012. Talks broke down over Yousuf wanting to take time off for Ramadan. Yousaf received the Pride of Performance award in August 2012.

<text>In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the retina of the eye to adjust to various levels of light. Natural night vision, or scotopic vision, is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, rod cells are exclusively responsible for night vision, as cone cells are only able to function at higher illumination levels. Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen. In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence &quot;setting&quot;, increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude. This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds.

== Efficiency ==

The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.

The eye takes approximately 20–30 minutes to fully adapt from bright sunlight to complete darkness and becomes 10,000 to 1,000,000 times more sensitive than at full daylight. In this process, the eye&#x27;s perception of color changes as well (this is called the Purkinje effect). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to adapt from darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark for the first five minutes but the rods taking over after five or more minutes. Cone cells are able to regain maximum retinal sensitivity in 9–10 minutes of darkness whereas rods require 30–45 minutes to do so.

Dark adaptation is far quicker and deeper in young people than the elderly.

=== Cones vs. rods ===

The human eye contains three types of photoreceptors, rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rods and cones are responsible for vision and connected to the visual cortex. ipRGCs are more connected to body clock functions and other parts of the brain but not the visual cortex. Rods and cones can be easily distinguished by their structure. Cone photoreceptors are conical in shape and contain cone opsins as their visual pigments. There exist three types of cone photoreceptors, each being maximally sensitive to a specific wavelength of light depending on the structure of their opsin photopigment. The various cone cells are maximally sensitive to either short wavelengths (blue light), medium wavelengths (green light), or long wavelengths (red light). Rod photoreceptors only contain one type of photopigment, rhodopsin, which has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of approximately 500 nanometers which corresponds to blue-green light.
The distribution of photoreceptor cells across the surface of the retina has important consequences for vision. Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in a depression in the center of the retina known as the fovea centralis and decrease in number towards the periphery of the retina. Conversely, rod photoreceptors are present at high density throughout most of the retina with a sharp decline in the fovea. Perception in high luminescence settings is dominated by cones despite the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by rods (approximately 4.5 million to 91 million).

== Ambient light response ==

A minor mechanism of adaptation is the pupillary light reflex, adjusting the amount of light that reaches the retina very quickly by about a factor of ten. Since it contributes only a tiny fraction of the overall adaptation to light it is not further considered here.

In response to varying ambient light levels, rods and cones of eye function both in isolation and in tandem to adjust the visual system. Changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones in the eye are the major contributors to dark adaptation.

Above a certain luminance level (about 0.03 cd/m), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision; photopic vision. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing scotopic (night) vision. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the mesopic range, as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism. This adaptation forms the basis of the Duplicity Theory.

== Advantages of night vision ==

Many animals such as cats possess high-resolution night vision, allowing them to discriminate objects with high frequencies in low illumination settings. The &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; is a reflective structure that is responsible for this superior night vision as it mirrors light back through the retina exposing the photoreceptor cells to an increased amount of light. Most animals which possess a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; are nocturnal most likely because upon reflection of light back through the retina the initial images become blurred. Humans, like their primate relatives, do not possess a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; and therefore were predisposed to be a diurnal species.

Despite the fact that the resolution of human day vision is far superior to that of night vision, human night vision provides many advantages. Like many predatory animals, humans can use their night vision to prey upon and ambush other animals without their awareness. Furthermore, in the event of an emergency situation occurring at night, humans can increase their chances of survival if they are able to perceive their surroundings and get to safety. Both of these benefits can be used to explain why humans did not completely lose the ability to see in the dark from their nocturnal ancestors.

== Dark adaptation ==
Rhodopsin, a biological pigment in the photoreceptors of the retina, immediately photobleaches in response to light. Visual phototransduction starts with the isomerizing of the pigment chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans retinal. Then this pigment dissociates into free opsin and all-trans retinal. Dark adaptation of both rods and cones requires the regeneration of the visual pigment from opsin and 11-cis retinal. Therefore, the time required for dark adaptation and pigment regeneration is largely determined by the local concentration of 11-cis retinal and the rate at which it is delivered to the opsin in the bleached rods. The decrease in calcium ion influx after channel closing causes phosphorylation of metarhodopsin II and speeds up the cis-retinal to trans-retinal inactivation. The phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin is mediated by recoverin. The regeneration of the photopigments occurs during dark adaptation albeit at markedly different rates. Rods are more sensitive to light and so take longer to fully adapt to the change in light. Rods, whose photopigments regenerate more slowly, do not reach their maximum sensitivity for about two hours. Cones take approximately 9–10 minutes to adapt to the dark.
Sensitivity to light is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium ions and cyclic guanosine monophosphate.

The sensitivity of the rod pathway improves considerably within 5–10 minutes in the dark. Color testing has been used to determine the time at which rod mechanism takes over; when the rod mechanism takes over colored spots appear colorless as only cone pathways encode color.

Three factors affect how quickly the rod mechanism becomes dominant:
*Intensity and duration of the pre-adapting light: By increasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances, the duration of cone mechanism dominance extends, while the rod mechanism switch over is more delayed. In addition the absolute threshold takes longer to reach. The opposite is true for decreasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances.
*Size and location on the retina: The location of the test spot affects the dark adaptation curve because of the distribution of the rods and cones in the retina.
*Wavelength of the threshold light: Varying the wavelengths of stimuli also affect the dark adaptation curve. Long wavelengths—such as extreme red—create the absence of a distinct rod/cone break, as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long wavelengths. Conversely, at short wavelengths the rod/cone break is more prominent, because the rod cells are much more sensitive than cones once the rods have dark adapted.

===Intracellular signalling===
Under scotopic conditions, intracellular cGMP concentration is high in photoreceptors. cGMP binds to and opens cGMP gated Na channels to allow sodium and calcium influx. Sodium influx contributes to depolarization while calcium influx increases local calcium concentrations near the receptor. Calcium binds to a modulatory protein, which is proposed to be GUCA1B, removing this protein&#x27;s stimulatory effect on guanylyl cyclase. This reduces cGMP production by guanylyl cyclase to lower cGMP concentration during prolonged darkness. Elevated calcium concentration also increases the activity of phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to further reduce its concentration. This reduces opening of the cGMP gated Na channels to hyperpolarise the cell, once again making it sensitive to small increases in brightness. Without dark adaptation, the photoreceptor would remain depolarized under scotopic conditions and so also remain unresponsive to small changes in brightness.

=== Inhibition ===
Inhibition by neurons also affects activation in synapses. Together with the bleaching of a rod or cone pigment, merging of signals on ganglion cells are inhibited, reducing convergence.

Alpha adaptation, &quot;i.e.&quot;, rapid sensitivity fluctuations, is powered by nerve control. The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect. Thus that area of stimulation is inversely proportional to intensity of light, a strong stimulus of 100 rods equivalent to a weak stimulus of 1,000 rods.

In sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye.

=== Measuring Dark Adaptation ===
Ophthalmologists sometimes measure patients&#x27; dark adaptation using an instrument known as a dark adaptometer.

There are multiple commercial dark adaptometers (AdaptDx, MetroVision MonCvONE, Roland Consult DARK-Adaptometer). Besides those free-viewing devices, a fundus-tracked workflow has been recently introduced by modifying a microperimetry device that enables testing of patients with unstable fixation.

==== Using Dark Adaptation Measurement to Diagnose Disease ====
Numerous clinical studies have shown that dark adaptation function is dramatically impaired from the earliest stages of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), and other retinal diseases, with increasing impairment as the diseases progress. AMD is a chronic, progressive disease that causes a part of the retina, called the macula, to slowly deteriorate over time. It is the leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. It is characterized by a breakdown of the RPE/Bruch&#x27;s membrane complex in the retina, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the macula. Eventually, these deposits become clinically visible drusen that affect photoreceptor health, causing inflammation and a predisposition to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). During the AMD disease course, the RPE/Bruch&#x27;s function continues to deteriorate, hampering nutrient and oxygen transport to the rod and cone photoreceptors. As a side effect of this process, the photoreceptors exhibit impaired dark adaptation because they require these nutrients for replenishment of photopigments and clearance of opsin to regain scotopic sensitivity after light exposure.

Measurement of a patient&#x27;s dark adaptation function is essentially a bioassay of the health of their Bruch&#x27;s membrane. As such, research has shown that, by measuring dark adaptation, doctors can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident.

==Accelerating dark adaptation==

Several different methods, with varying levels of evidence, have been purported or demonstrated to increase the rate at which vision can adapt in the dark.

=== Red lights and lenses ===
As a result of rod cells having a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of 500 nanometers they cannot perceive all colours on the visual spectrum. Because rod cells are insensitive to long wavelengths, the use of red lights and red lens glasses has become a common practice for accelerating dark adaptation. In order for dark adaptation to be significantly accelerated an individual should ideally begin this practice 30 minutes prior to entering a low luminescence setting. This practice will allow an individual to maintain their photopic (day) vision whilst preparing for scotopic vision. The insensitivity to red light will prevent the rod cells from further becoming bleached and allow for the rhodopsin photopigment to recharge back to its active conformation. Once an individual enters a dark setting most of their rod cells will already be accommodated to the dark and be able to transmit visual signals to the brain without an accommodation period.

The concept of red lenses for dark adaptation is based upon experimentation by Antoine Béclère and his early work with radiology. In 1916, the scientist Wilhelm Trendelenburg invented the first pair of red adaptation goggles for radiologists to adapt their eyes to view screens during fluoroscopic procedures.

==== Evolutionary context ====
Although many aspects of the human visual system remain uncertain, the theory of the evolution of rod and cone photopigments is agreed upon by most scientists. It is believed that the earliest visual pigments were those of cone photoreceptors, with rod opsin proteins evolving later. Following the evolution of mammals from their reptilian ancestors approximately 275 million years ago there was a nocturnal phase in which complex colour vision was lost. Being that these pro-mammals were nocturnal they increased their sensitivity in low luminescence settings and reduced their photopic system from tetrachromatic to dichromatic. The shift to a nocturnal lifestyle would demand more rod photoreceptors to absorb the blue light emitted by the moon during the night. It can be extrapolated that the high ratio of rods to cones present in modern human eyes was retained even after the shift from nocturnal back to diurnal.

It is believed that the emergence of trichromacy in primates occurred approximately 55 million years ago when the surface temperature of the planet began to rise. The primates were diurnal rather than nocturnal in nature and therefore required a more precise photopic visual system. A third cone photopigment was necessary to cover the entire visual spectrum enabling primates to better discriminate between fruits and detect those of the highest nutritional value.

====Applications ====
*Aviators commonly wear red lensed glasses or goggles prior to taking off in the dark to ensure that they are able to see outside of the aircraft. Furthermore, throughout flight the cockpit is illuminated with dim red lights. This lighting is to ensure that the pilot is able to read instruments and maps while maintaining scotopic vision for looking outside.
*Submarines: Oftentimes submarines are &quot;rigged for red&quot;, meaning that the boat is going to be surfacing or coming to periscope depth at night. During such times illumination within certain compartments is switched to red light to allow the eyes of the lookouts and officers to adjust to the darkness prior to looking outside of the boat. Additionally, compartments on a submarine may be illuminated with red light in order to simulate night conditions for the crew.

=== Vitamin A ===
Vitamin A is necessary for proper functioning of the human eye. The photopigment rhodopsin found in human rod cells is composed of retinal, a form of vitamin A, bound to an opsin protein. Upon the absorption of light rhodopsin was decomposed into retinal and opsin through bleaching. Retinal could then have one of two fates: it could recombine with opsin to reform rhodopsin or it could be converted into free retinol. The American scientist George Wald was the first to recognize that the visual system expends vitamin A and is dependent upon diet for its replacement.

Vitamin A serves many functions in the human body outside of healthy vision. It is vital in maintaining a healthy immune system as well as promoting normal growth and development. The average adult male and female should consume 900 and 700 micrograms of vitamin A per day, respectively. Consumption above 3000 micrograms per day can lead to acute or chronic hypervitaminosis A.

==== Sources of vitamin A ====
Vitamin A is present in both animal and plant sources as retinoids and carotenoids, respectively. Retinoids can be used immediately by the body upon absorption into the cardiovascular system; however, plant-based carotenoids must be converted to retinol prior to utilization by the body. The highest animal-based sources of vitamin A are liver, dairy products, and fish. Fruits and vegetables containing high amounts of carotenoids are dark green, yellow, orange, and red in colour.

==== Evolutionary context ====
Vitamin A-based opsin proteins have been used for sensing light in organisms for most of evolutionary history beginning approximately 3 billion years ago. This feature has been passed from unicellular to multicellular organisms including Homo sapiens. This vitamin was most likely selected by evolution for sensing light because retinal causes a shift in photoreceptor absorbance to the visible light range. This shift in absorbance is especially important for life on Earth because it generally matches the peak irradiance of sunlight on its surface. A second reason why retinal evolved to be vital for human vision is because it undergoes a large conformational change when exposed to light. This conformational change is believed to make it easier for the photoreceptor protein to distinguish between its silent and activated state thus better controlling visual phototransduction.

==== Experimental evidence ====
Various studies have been conducted testing the effective of vitamin A supplementation on dark adaptation. In a study by Cideciyan et al. the length of dark adaptation was measured in a patient with systemic vitamin A deficiency (VAD) before and after vitamin A supplementation. The dark adaptation function was measured prior to supplementation, 1 day post-treatment, and 75 days post-treatment. It was observed that after merely one day of vitamin A supplementation the recovery kinetics of dark adaptation were significantly accelerated after photoreceptor bleaching. Dark adaptation was further accelerated following 75 days of treatment.

A subsequent study by Kemp et al. studied dark adaptation in subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis and Crohn&#x27;s disease, both of whom had vitamin A deficiency. Within 8 days of oral supplementation of vitamin A both patients had their visual function restored to normal. Furthermore, adaptation kinetics significantly improved in both subjects following supplementation.

Later independent studies in Sorby fundus dystrophy confirmed the effect of Vitamin A on dark adaptation. Likewise, Vitamin A was shown to accelerate (to a lesser extent) dark adaptation in AMD.

=== Anthocyanins ===

Anthocyanins make up the majority of the 4000 known flavonoid phytochemicals. This group of approximately 600 bioactive antioxidants carries the strongest physiological effects of any plant compound. These chemicals are also the most visible of the flavonoid phytochemicals because they provide bright blue, red, or purple pigmentation to many plant species. Anthocyanins also serve to protect the photosynthetic tissues from the direct rays of the sun.
In addition, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasoprotective properties of anthocyanins allow them to demonstrate diverse health effects. In humans, anthocyanins are effective for a variety of health conditions including neurological damage, atherosclerosis, diabetes, as well as visual impairment. Anthocyanins frequently interact with other phytochemicals to potentiate biological effects; therefore, contributions from individual biomolecules remains difficult to decipher.
As a result of anthocyanins providing bright colouration to flowers, the plants containing these phytochemicals are naturally successful in attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. The fruits and vegetables produced by such plants are also brightly pigmented attracting animals to eat them and disperse the seeds. Due to this natural mechanism anthocyanin-containing plants are widely abundant in most areas of the world. The high abundance and distribution of anthocyanin-containing plants make it a natural food source for many animals. Through fossil evidence it is known that these compounds were eaten in high amounts by primitive hominins.

During World Wars I and II British Air Force aviators were known to consume extensive amounts of bilberry jam. The aviators consumed this anthocyanin-rich food due to its many visual benefits, included accelerated dark adaptation, which would be valuable for night bombing missions.

==== Food sources ====

Brightly coloured fruits and vegetables are rich in anthocyanins. This makes sense intuitively because anthocyanins offer pigmentation to plants. Blackberries are the most anthocyanin-rich foods, containing 89-211 milligrams per 100 grams. Other foods that are rich in this phytochemical include red onions, blueberries, bilberries, red cabbage, and eggplant. The ingestion of any of these food sources will yield a variety of phytochemicals in addition to anthocyanins because they naturally exist together. The daily intake of anthocyanins is estimated to be approximately 200 milligrams in the average adult; however, this value can reach several grams per day if an individual is consuming flavonoid supplements.

==== Effect on dark adaptation====
Anthocyanins accelerate dark adaptation in humans by enhancing the regeneration of the rod photopigment, rhodopsin. Anthocyanins accomplish this by binding directly to opsin upon the degradation of rhodopsin to its individual constituents by light. Once bound to opsin, the anthocyanin changes its structure thereby accelerating its access to the retinal binding pocket. By having a diet rich in anthocyanins an individual is able to generate rhodopsin in shorter periods of time because of the increased affinity of opsin to retinal. Through this mechanism an individual is able to accelerate dark adaptation and achieve night vision in a shorter period of time.

==== Supportive evidence ====
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted by Nakaishi et al. a powdered anthocyanin concentrate derived from black currants was provided to a number of participants. Participants received one of three doses of anthocyanins to measure if the result occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The period of dark adaptation was measured prior to and two hours following supplementation in all participants. Results from this experiment indicate that anthocyanins significantly accelerated dark adaptation at merely one dose level compared to the placebo. Observing the data as a whole Nakaishi et al. concluded that anthocyanins effectively reduced the dark adaptation period in a dose-dependent manner.

==== Contradictory evidence ====
Despite the fact that many scientists believe anthocyanins to be beneficial in accelerating dark adaptation in humans, a study conducted by Kalt et al. in 2014 showed blueberry anthocyanins have no effect. In this study two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to examine dark adaptation following the intake of blueberry products. In neither study did the blueberry anthocyanin intake affect the length of dark adaptation. From these results Kalt et al. concluded that blueberry anthocyanins provide no significant difference to the dark adaptation component of human vision.

== Light adaptation ==
With light adaptation, the eye has to quickly adapt to the background illumination to be able to distinguish objects in this background. The process for light adaptation occurs over a period of five minutes.

The photochemical reaction is:
: Rhodopsin ⇌ retinal + opsin

=== Increment threshold ===

Using increment threshold experiments, light adaptation can be measured clinically. In an increment threshold experiment, a test stimulus is presented on a background of a certain luminance, the stimulus is increased until the detection threshold is reached against the background. A monophasic or biphasic threshold versus intensity TVI curve is obtained through this method for both cones and rods.

When the threshold curve for a single system (i.e., just cones or just rods) is taken in isolation it can be seen to possess four sections:

;1. Dark light: The threshold in this portion of the TVI curve is determined by the dark/light level. Sensitivity is limited by neural noise. The background field is relatively low and does not significantly affect threshold.
;2. Square root law: This part of the curve is limited by quantal fluctuation in the background. The visual system is usually compared with a theoretical construct called the ideal light detector. To detect the stimulus, the stimulus must sufficiently exceed the fluctuations of the background (noise).
;3. Weber&#x27;s law: Threshold increases with background luminance proportional to the square root of the background.
;4. Saturation: At saturation, the rod system becomes unable to detect the stimulus. This section of the curve occurs for the cone mechanism under high background levels.

== Insufficiency ==
Insufficiency of adaptation most commonly presents as insufficient adaptation to dark environment, called night blindness or &quot;nyctalopia&quot;. The opposite problem, known as hemeralopia, that is, inability to see clearly in bright light, is much rarer.

The fovea is blind to dim light (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night must be viewed from the side, so it stimulates the rods. This is not due to pupil width since an artificial fixed-width pupil gives the same results.

Night blindness can be caused by a number of factors the most common of which being vitamin A deficiency. If detected early enough nyctalopia can be reversed and visual function can be regained; however; prolonged vitamin A deficiency can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated.

Night blindness is especially prominent in developing countries due to malnutrition and therefore a lack of vitamin A in the diet. In developed countries night blindness has historically been uncommon due to adequate food availability; however, the incidence is expected to increase as obesity becomes more common. Increased obesity rates correspond to an increased number of bariatric surgeries, causing malabsorption of vitamin A in the human body.

<text>Muhammad Moin Khan (; born 23 September 1971) is a Pakistani cricket administrator, coach, and former cricketer, primarily a wicket-keeper-batsman, who remained a member of the Pakistani national cricket team from 1990 to 2004. He was a part of the Pakistani squad which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup. He has also captained the Pakistani side, and led the team to be the champions of the 2000 Asia Cup.

He made his international debut against the West Indies at Multan.

He took over 100 catches in Test cricket, has scored over 3,000 ODI runs, and has taken over 200 catches in ODI cricket.

He is credited with coining the name of Saqlain Mushtaq&#x27;s mystery delivery that goes from leg to off, as the &quot;doosra&quot;. It means the &quot;other one&quot; in Urdu.

==Personal life==
Khan&#x27;s elder son Owais married television actress Mariam Ansari in February 2021.

His younger son Azam Khan made his T20I debut for Pakistan against England in July 2021 and plays for Islamabad United in the PSL.

==Cricket career==
===International career===

Throughout his international career, Moin had to compete with another wicket-keeper, Rashid Latif. Moin kept wickets in the 1992 Cricket World Cup which Pakistan won and the 1999 Cricket World Cup where Pakistan finished runners-up. Latif kept wickets in the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

During the 1992 Cricket World Cup Semi-final against New Zealand, Pakistan needed 9 runs for 8 balls before Khan hit a six to make it 3 runs off 7 balls and then hit a boundary to help Pakistan set up a clash in the World Cup final with England. In the World Cup final, Pakistan was 249 from 50 overs with Khan not getting a chance to bat. However, he took three catches in the match including one of Ian Botham, who went for a duck against an inswinger bowled by Wasim Akram.

===Domestic career===
In 2005, Moin scored the first century in Pakistan domestic Twenty20 cricket when he smashed 112 off 59 balls for Karachi Dolphins against Lahore Lions in the ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup. At the end of the season, he retired from cricket finishing with 200 not out against Hyderabad, his highest first-class score.

In 2007, Moin signed with the unofficial Indian Cricket League and coached the Hyderabad Heroes. In the 2008 edition of the competition, he coached the expansion team, the Lahore Badshahs.

==Cricket administration and coaching career==

Moin Khan runs his own academy situated in Karachi, a city where he has relocated for many years, named &quot;DHA Sports Club Moin Khan Academy&quot;, that provides facilities not only for cricket but also for other sports such as football, squash, and swimming.

In July 2013, he replaced Iqbal Qasim as the chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team. But in 2015, during the Cricket World Cup 2015, he was removed from the position after the team&#x27;s poor performance during the World Cup.

In August 2013, he was appointed the manager of the team.

In February 2014, he was appointed as the new head coach of the national team, replacing Dav Whatmore.

Since 2016, he has been serving as the head coach of the PSL franchise Quetta Gladiators.

== Controversies ==
===Domestic violence===
In January 2007, Moin Khan was freed on bail after a short detention following his wife Tasneem Khan&#x27;s complaint to a local police helpline that she was beaten up.

===Casino visit===
In February 2015, Moin Khan, who was the chief selector of Pakistan team, went under investigation for allegedly visiting a casino before Pakistan team&#x27;s heavy loss to West Indies in World Cup 2015. Moin Khan later apologized for his actions but reiterated that he just went to the casino to have dinner. In March 2015, PCB accepted Moin Khan&#x27;s casino explanation and said that there will be no action taken against him.

<doc id="554136" wikidata="Q3296754" url="?curid=554136" title="Andrea Feldman">
<text>Andrea Feldman (April 1, 1948 – August 8, 1972) was an American actress and Warhol superstar. She committed suicide in 1972.

==Career==
Andrea Feldman was a native New Yorker. She attended Quintano&#x27;s School for Young Professionals, a high school for the performing arts. She starred in three Warhol films; &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot;, &quot;Trash&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot;.
A regular in the back room of Max&#x27;s Kansas City, she pioneered a performance which she called &quot;Showtime&quot;, in which she performed a striptease on the round table, at the center of the room. She became known for her dependence on drugs, particularly amphetamines.

Feldman was featured in a 1970 documentary called &quot;Groupies&quot;, where she referred to herself by a nickname given to her by the Warhol crowd; Andrea &quot;Whips&quot; Feldman. She also often referred to herself as &quot;Andrea Warhol&quot;. She was known by her friends as &quot;Crazy Andy.&quot; Feldman&#x27;s friend performer Penny Arcade recalled that &quot;a lot of people in the Warhol scene pretended to be crazy, but Andrea really was. She had endless money for everything but mental health.&quot;

Her suicide preceded the release of &quot;Heat&quot; in 1972, which she had a much larger role than in previous Warhol films. Feldman&#x27;s performance garnered positive reviews. Judith Crist, a critic for &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;The most striking performance, in large part non-performance, comes from the late Andrea Feldman, as the flat-voiced, freaked-out daughter, a mass of psychotic confusion, infantile and heart-breaking.&quot;

== Death ==
Several days after returning from Europe, Feldman summoned several ex-boyfriends, including poet Jim Carroll, to the New York City apartment of her parents to witness what she called her &quot;final starring role.&quot; On August 8, 1972, Feldman jumped to her death at 51 Fifth Avenue. She was holding a bible and a crucifix although she was Jewish.

Photographer Leee Black Childers was dating Feldman at the time and said leading up to her death she had begun to act strange towards him: &quot;Andrea and I were engaged at the time and we were going to get married. It was sort of a ploy at first but it started to get serious. Her parents would commit her to Bellevue now and then to keep her under their thumb.&quot; Childers recalled that the day before her suicide, &quot;Andrea stood up on a chair and held a picture of Marilyn Monroe over her head, and she just stood there ... After a long time of just standing there, she said, &#x27;Marilyn died; love me while you can!&#x27;&quot;

Feldman&#x27;s close friend Geraldine Smith wrote in her obituary for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and said &quot;Andrea left a note addressed to everyone she knew, saying she loved us all, but &#x27;I&#x27;m going for the big time, I hit the jackpot!&quot; Rumors spread that the note that Feldman left behind wasn&#x27;t as kind as Smith&#x27;s obituary implied. According to former &quot;Interview&quot; magazine editor Bob Colacello, &quot;the note wasn&#x27;t to everyone and it wasn&#x27;t about love; it was to Andy and it was very, very nasty.&quot; Many people associated with the Factory agreed that Warhol was not to blame for her death. Smith later said Feldman&#x27;s childhood trauma led to her suicide: &quot;Her mother left her alone when she was two years old and she never got over that. She was hospitalized a couple of times. She always planned to commit suicide. But she would blame Andy and say terrible things about him.&quot;

The sausages are heated in water—well short of boiling—for about ten minutes, which will turn them greyish-white because no colour-preserving nitrite is used in preparation.

Ways of eating include the traditional way, called (Bavarian for sucking), in which each end of the sausage is cut or bitten open, after which the meat is sucked out from the skin. Alternatively, the more popular and more discreet ways of consuming it are by cutting the sausage lengthwise and then &quot;rolling out&quot; the meat from the skin with a fork, or also to open it on one end and consume it very much like a banana, ever opening the peel further and dipping the sausage into the mustard.

<doc id="554144" wikidata="Q1788438" url="?curid=554144" title="Patience (George Michael album)">
<text>Patience is the fifth and final studio album by the English singer-songwriter George Michael, released on 15 March 2004. The much delayed follow-up to &quot;Older&quot;, at the time of its release it was considered Michael&#x27;s comeback album since it was his first album composed of original material since 1996, and his first for Sony Music since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot;. &quot;Patience&quot; spawned six singles. The first two, &quot;Freeek!&quot; and &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;, were already released in 2002 by Polydor, when the album was originally due.

In a 2004 interview with Adam Mattera for UK magazine &quot;Attitude&quot;, Michael explained how he felt reenergised and excited about the project: &quot;There&#x27;s something about the vocals on this album that&#x27;s a lot more confident, more certain. There are proclamations of love that I&#x27;ve never made before – certainly since Wham! – and then there&#x27;s going further into the truth at the same time, like on &quot;My Mother Had a Brother&quot; or &quot;Through&quot; – they&#x27;re trying to get closer to the truth.&quot;

== Return to Sony ==
On 17 November 2003, Michael re-signed with Sony Music, the company he had left after a legal battle in which Michael claimed that his contract was stifling him and was keeping him in &quot;professional slavery&quot;. As a result, his contract was sold by Sony to rival record companies Virgin Records and DreamWorks Records on 14 July 1995.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Patience&quot; went on sale in most of the world in late March 2004 and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and at number 2 in Australia on 22 March. It became one of the fastest-selling albums in the UK, selling over 275,000 copies in the first week. The album went on sale in the US on 18 May 2004; however, it did not contain &quot;Patience Pt. II&quot; and &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;. It debuted in the US at number 29 but after TV appearances, such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, the following week, it reached its chart peak of number 12. As of 2006, the album had sold 381,000 in the United States. It has sold around four million copies worldwide.

The first single &quot;Freeek!&quot; had already reached number one in Italy, Spain and Denmark in March 2002 and reached the top ten in the UK and top five in Australia. The album features a remixed version called &quot;Freeek! &#x27;04&quot;.

The second single, &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;, was released in July 2002. It was not released as a single in Canada or the US over sensitivity to the 11 September 2001 attacks, and was not included on the &quot;Patience&quot; album in those countries. While it reached the top five in Spain, Italy and Denmark, it failed to reach the top ten in the UK.

The third single from &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, was released in March 2004 and went to number one in Italy and Spain, also reaching number 4 in the UK and number 6 in Australia.

The fourth single, &quot;Flawless (Go to the City)&quot;, was released in June 2004 and reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. It reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

In November 2004, Sony released a fifth single from &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Round Here&quot;. The single reached number 32 on the UK charts.

&quot;John and Elvis Are Dead&quot;, the sixth single, was released in October 2005 and only sold through the Internet as a download.

== Anti-war song ==
The album contains the anti-war song &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;. When released in July 2002, &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot; had already proved to be controversial. It was highly critical of George W. Bush and Tony Blair in the leadup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The video showed a cartoon version of Michael astride a nuclear missile in the Middle East and Tony and Cherie Blair in bed with President Bush. The latter image was apparently intended as a homage to the 1986 video for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; by Genesis. The cartoon was produced by the makers of &quot;2DTV&quot;, a satirical animated television show broadcast weekly on the independent television station ITV in the UK.

In an interview with MTV, Michael said the song was primarily intended to highlight what he saw as a lack of consultation by Tony Blair about the decision of invading Iraq. &quot;People are looking at the song in context of an attack on America, as opposed to an attack on Tony Blair. And really, my attack is that Tony Blair is not involving the British in this issue. He&#x27;s perfectly happy staying up to watch the World Cup and enjoying the Jubilee, all things I&#x27;m perfectly guilty of, but there&#x27;s a serious discussion about Iraq, which hasn&#x27;t taken place. We don&#x27;t know what Saddam Hussein is capable of, the British public has no idea.&quot;

== Final album ==
Michael announced &quot;Patience&quot; would be his last album on sale to the public as a physical release as well as digital. He told BBC Radio 1 on 10 March 2004 that music he put out in the future would be available for download with fans encouraged to make a donation to charity. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been very well remunerated for my talents over the years so I really don&#x27;t need the public&#x27;s money. I&#x27;d like to have something on the Internet which is a charitable download site where anyone can download my music for free. I&#x27;ll have my favourite charities up there and people will hopefully donate to that.&quot; He stated that the decision would put less pressure to produce a new album every so often and allow him to have more of a private life.

&quot;Patience&quot; was Michael&#x27;s final studio album of original material before his death on 25 December 2016.

<text>Michael Johann Joseph Brokoff (; 28 April 1686 – 8 September 1721) was a Czech sculptor of the Baroque era, working with sandstone.

==Biography==
Michael Brokoff was born in Klášterec nad Ohří as the oldest son of Jan Brokoff, also a sculptor, and apprenticed in his workshop at first. Later he continued his education by Filip Ondřej Quitainer and possibly also Jan Oldřich Mayer, two distinct sculptors and carvers of the time. After his father&#x27;s death he took over his workshop for a short time in 1718. He is said to surpass the work of his father by technical excellency although he never achieved the supreme style of his younger brother Ferdinand Brokoff, to whom he forwarded leading of the family workshop.

Many important sculptures are attributed to him, at least as a co-author: the statue of &quot;St. Adalbert of Prague&quot; from 1709 on Charles Bridge, Prague (in collaboration with his brother Ferdinand), statue of &quot;St. Ludmila&quot; at Vyšehrad, Prague, &quot;Herculius&quot; at the garden of the Kolowrat Palace in Prague, statuary of &quot;Virgin Mary&quot; in Police nad Metují, etc.

In contrast to his brother, Michael Brokoff&#x27;s work is said to be &quot;less exacting&quot;; the expression of the statues is concentrated into the mimics of the heads, with the gestures of the body somewhat tense.

Brokoff died on 8 September 1721 in Prague, at the age of 35.

<text>The Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston (EOKA ; ) was a Greek Cypriot nationalist guerrilla organization that fought a campaign for the end of British rule in Cyprus, and for eventual union with Greece.

==Background==
Cyprus, an island in the Eastern Mediterranean inhabited mostly by Greeks, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire from 1571 and remained under its control until 4 June 1878, when in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War, it was handed to the British empire. By that time, a sizeable Turkish minority population had also been established in the island. As nationalistic tendencies grew in both major population groups, Greek Cypriots advocated for &quot;Enosis&quot; (Union with Greece) which was a part of the Megali idea. The origins of Enosis date back to 1821, the year when the Greek War of Independence commenced, and the archbishop of Cyprus, his archdeacon, and three bishops were beheaded by the Ottoman colonial administration, amongst other atrocities. In 1828, Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor of Greece, asked for the union of Cyprus with Greece, while small-scale uprisings also occurred. In 1878, when British general Wolsely came to Cyprus to formally establish British rule, he was met by the archbishop of Kition who, after welcoming him, requested that Britain cede Cyprus to Greece. Initially, the Greek Cypriots welcomed British rule, as they were aware that the British had returned the Ionian Islands to Greece in 1864. They were also hopeful for British investment in Cyprus, which the Ottoman occupation left as an impoverished island.

In 1912, the British government made an offer to Greece to exchange Cyprus for a naval base in Argostoli, in order to gain control of the Ionian Sea, an offer which was repeated in 1913. In 1915, the British offered Cyprus to Greece several times in exchange for Greece&#x27;s participation in World War I. While Greece was undecided whether it should enter the War, however, the British government withdrew its offer. By 1915, the Greek Cypriots&#x27; opposition to British rule had increased, seeing that neither the British investment nor Enosis had materialized. In the beginning, the Enosis movement had only few supporters, mainly from the upper classes. However, that was about to change as two groups, disappointed with the new ruler, began to form, namely the Church and the Usurers. A number of Cypriots studying in Greece in the following years became strong advocates of Enosis upon their return. On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriot community started to develop its own nationalism in the early 20th century, as news arrived in the island about the persecutions faced by Muslims in the countries that formed after the collapse of Ottoman Empire.

The November 1926 appointment of Ronald Storrs (a philhellene) as the new governor of Cyprus, fostered the idea among Greek Cypriot nationalists that British rule would be a stepping stone for the eventual union with Greece. Their relationship was to sour in 1928, when Greek Cypriots refused to take part in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the British occupation of Cyprus. Greece appealed for calm, limiting the spread of anti-colonial articles in Greek Cypriot newspapers. Education became another arena of conflict with the passage of the Education Act, which sought to curtail Greek influence in the Cypriot school curricula. Cypriot irredentists also lamented the supposedly preferential treatment of Malta and Egypt at the expense of Cyprus. Relations worsened further when the British authorities unilaterally passed a new penal code which permitted among other things the use of torture. In 1929, Legislative Council members Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos and Stavros Stavrinakis arrived in London, presenting a memorandum to the secretary of colonies Lord Passfield which contained demands for Enosis. As with previous such attempts the answer was negative.

In September 1931, Storrs blocked a Legislative Council decision to halt tax hikes that were to cover a local budget deficit. Greek Cypriot MPs reacted by resigning from their positions. Furthermore, on 18 October, Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos called Greek Cypriots to engage in acts of civil disobedience until their demands for Enosis were fulfilled. On 21 October 1931, 5,000 Greek Cypriots, mostly students, priests and city notables rallied in the streets of Nicosia while chanting pro–Enosis slogans in what came to be known as the October Events. The crowd besieged Government House, following three hours of stone throwing the building was set on fire. The rioters were eventually dispersed by police. At the same time British flags were stripped from public offices across the country, often being substituted with Greek ones. Order was restored by the beginning of November. A total of seven protesters were killed, thirty were injured, ten were exiled for life, while 2,606 received various punishments ranging from prison terms to fines on account of seditious activities.

The revolt damaged both the Enotic cause and the Anglo–Hellenic relations. The Legislative Council and municipal elections were abolished, the appointment of village authorities and district judges was relegated to the governor of the island. Propagating Enotic ideas and flying foreign flags was banned as was the assembly of more than 5 people. Cyprus thus entered a period of autocratic rule known as &quot;Palmerokratia&quot; (Παλμεροκρατία; ), named after governor Richmond Palmer, which started shortly before the revolt and would last until the beginning of World War II.

In the 1950s, EOKA was established with the specific aim of mounting a military campaign to end the status of Cyprus as a British crown colony and achieving the island&#x27;s unification with Greece. The leadership of AKEL at the time, the island&#x27;s communist party, opposed EOKA&#x27;s military action, advocating a &quot;Gandhiesque approach&quot; of civil disobedience, such as workers&#x27; strikes and demonstrations.

Initially, the struggle was political, as opposed to military. EOKA, in Grivas&#x27; words, wanted to attract the attention of the world through high-profile operations that would make headlines.

==Formation==

===Leadership===
EOKA was headed by Georgios Grivas, a Greek Army officer, World War I and World War II veteran. During the Axis occupation of Greece in World War II, he led a small, anti-communist resistance group, named Organization X. During the anti-communist struggle of December 1944 in Athens after the Axis withdrawal he was saved due to British intervention. Grivas assumed the nom de guerre &quot;Digenis&quot; in direct reference to the legendary Byzantine Digenis Akritas who repelled invaders from the Byzantine Empire. Second in command in EOKA was Grigoris Afxentiou, also a former officer of the Greek army. Afxentiou had graduated from the reserves Officers Academy in 1950 without previous experience on battlefield.

===Objectives===
The main objective of EOKA was Enosis. The organization adopted typical Greek national ideologies and displayed religious, conservative and anticommunist ideas. This was in agreement with the prevailing ideas of Cypriot society at the time. There was a widespread belief that leftists opposed national objectives and provided a certain support to the colonial regime contrary to other contemporary anti-colonial insurgencies in Africa or Asia, which were led by Marxists.

Grivas and Archbishop Makarios III disagreed about the way to rid the island of British rule. Grivas rejected Makarios&#x27; attempt to limit the campaign to acts of sabotage, avoiding loss of life. Nevertheless, he shared Makarios&#x27; view that victory would be won by diplomatic means. Grivas&#x27; goal was to subject the British to continued relentless harassment, making it clear to them that occupation carried a price, while keeping Enosis on the international diplomatic agenda. The British response to the EOKA campaign was crucial in this regard: repression would on the one hand alienate the Greek Cypriot population from British rule, and on the other hand provide Makarios and the Greek government with a stick to beat the British with before the United Nations. EOKA would ensure that there was a Cyprus problem and demonstrate to the world that the British could not resolve it.

===Preparations===
Grivas carried out a first reconnaissance in Cyprus as early as July 1951.
Makarios was certainly skeptical, telling Grivas on one occasion that he would not find supporters for an armed struggle. The British shared the same view. Grivas finally arrived on the island in early November 1954 and set about establishing his underground network. He recruited from the Cyprus Farmers&#x27; Union (PEK) in the villages and from the two main youth movements, the Church-controlled Christian Youth Movement (OHEN) and the nationalist Pancyprian Youth Movement (PEON) in the towns. Grivas intended to turn the youth of Cyprus &#x27;into the seedbed of EOKA&#x27;. The backbone of EOKA were the mountain groups, a conventional guerrilla force living in hidden camps in the forests, and the town groups, often continuing their civilian job or schooling. Supporting this armed wing was the much broader National Front of Cyprus (EMAK), which provided EOKA with intelligence, supplies, weapons, medicines, recruits and safe houses, confronted the British on the streets with demonstrations and riots and conducted the propaganda offensive.

===ANE===
ANE () was the EOKA youth movement during the struggle for enosis between 1955 and 1959. The youth organisation had a self-governing body that was directly responsible to the leader of EOKA, Digenis. Among its activities was demonstrating against the British rule in Cyprus.

==Armed campaign==
=== From April 1955 to the dismissal of governor Armitage (October) ===
The armed struggle started on the night of 29 March – April 1955. A total of 18 bomb attacks occurred in various locations across the island. Most notable incidents were those of Nicosia by the group of Markos Drakos as well as the demolition of the Cyprus Broadcasting Station&#x27;s transmitter. The attacks were accompanied by a revolutionary proclamation signed by &quot;The leader, Digenes&quot;. Grivas decided to keep his involvement secret at the moment and used the name of a Byzantine general who had defended Cyprus in the medieval era. Grivas also prohibited attacks on the Turkish Cypriots at the time, and only wanted British soldiers and Greek collaborators to be targeted. The British, not expecting this turn of events, reinforced their local military bases (Dhekelia and Akrotiri) by transferring troops from Egypt.

At the end of April EOKA attacks temporarily paused, giving time to Grivas to organize the youth. A second offensive was launched on 19 June with coordinated bomb and grenade attacks against police stations, military installations and the homes of army officers and senior officials. One of those bombings demolished the building of the Famagusta Police headquarters. Those attacks were usually followed by sporadic incidents: shootings, bombings and increased public disorder. This second wave of EOKA attacks lasted until the end of June, totaling 204 attacks since the beginning of the armed resistance.

In August, two Special Branch members were assassinated in separate incidents. The raising of the Greek flag during demonstrations usually led to clashes with the colonial authorities, the latter removing it by force if necessary. Another major EOKA success was the escape from Kyrenia castle prison of 16 EOKA members including a number of key figures, such as Markos Drakos and Grigoris Afxentiou.

==== British reactions ====
The situation seemed to be deteriorating out of control and the British authorities attempted to safeguard their position in Cyprus by diplomatic maneuvering and a counterinsurgency offensive. The first involved playing the Greek and Turkish governments off against each other. Eden saw Turkey as &quot;the key protecting British interests&quot; in Cyprus. By the end of September, as the crisis was escalating, the British Government decided to replace governor Armitage. Then, British policy also aimed at the dramatic increase in recruitment of Turkish Cypriots. By the start of 1956, they had come to dominate the police force numbering 4,000 compared to less than 1,000 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots were very much in the front line against EOKA. Inevitably, the use of Turkish Cypriot policemen against the Greek Cypriot community exacerbated relations between the two communities.

==== Turkish reactions ====
In August 1955, Adnan Menderes, the then Turkish president, announced that Turkey would not accept any changes in the status of Cyprus that were not in Turkey&#x27;s interests. In Turkey, public opinion was inflamed. Rumours spread in Turkish media that a slaughter of the Turkish Cypriot community was likely to occur; these were not totally unfounded, for in that June there had been a huge bomb explosion in the Turkish section of Nicosia, and Turkish Cypriot community leader Fazil Kucuk began receiving death threats. The increased tensions led to nationalist reactions in the country and the government-sponsored anti-Greek Istanbul pogrom of September 1955. At the same time, during the London Trilateral Conference between Britain, Turkey and Greece, an agreement failed to materialize due to Turkish concerns that what Greece meant by self-determination was an eventual annexation. During a meeting between the end of August and 7 September 1955, Turkey also argued that if the status of Cyprus under a British administration would not be respected, the whole Treaty of Lausanne would be questionable.

=== From October 1955 to March 1956 (Operation Forward Victory, phase I) ===
The new British governor John Harding arrived at 3 October. Harding sought to meet Archbishop Makarios, and both agreed on commencing what became known as &quot;Harding-Makarios negotiations&quot;. Increased security and stepping up military might was of Harding&#x27;s priorities. On 26 November, Harding declared a State of Emergency – that meant, amongst other things, implementation of the death penalty for non-fatality crimes. Repressive legislation and troop reinforcements did not succeed. The Greek Cypriot population was hostile and the Special Branch was neutered. The British response was large-scale cordon and search operations which rarely resulted in arrests or the discovery of arms caches, but which invariably alienated those whose houses were searched or who were roughed up and dragged off to be screened. Collective punishments, far from undermining support for EOKA, only succeeded in making the Greek Cypriots more hostile to British rule. Moreover, Harding viewed Cyprus very much as a pawn in the Cold War global situation: on 13 December he banned AKEL and detained 128 of its leading members, effectively crippling the only political party in Cyprus that opposed EOKA.

The inevitable result was to increase sympathy for EOKA and to assist its recruitment efforts. The problem was that the Greek Cypriot community was overwhelmingly in favour of Enosis. Far from moderates emerging with whom Britain could do a deal. It was this popular support, enabling Grivas and his small band of guerrillas to take on the growing security apparatus that Harding was marshaling against him, that sustained the armed struggle. It became clear that EOKA did have an effective intelligence apparatus and that the guerrillas were often forewarned of security intentions. Schoolchildren, domestic servants, civilian personnel on the military bases, the police, all were enlisted by Grivas in the intelligence war while the security forces were operating in the dark.

Operation &quot;Forward to Victory&quot; (Greek name) was launched on 18 November and was accompanied by several bomb attacks. In the urban areas, schoolchildren had a prominent role in the EOKA struggle. The &quot;Battle of Flags&quot;, escalated during the Autumn of 1955 and peaked in January and February 1956– that kept British forces busy away from chasing down EOKA. Schoolboys were not only participating in riots and stone-throwing against the police, but some of them were also trained to throw bombs and carry assassinations. Bombs by guerrillas and youngsters were thrown at British personnel houses, police stations and army camps. In some cases, EOKA members managed to steal some weaponry. The British were never to succeed completely eliminating EOKA agents from the police force.

The struggle continued in the mountains as the guerrillas expanded their network in the Troodos mountains. However, due to harsh winter conditions in addition to certain British military pressure, the activity of EOKA temporarily eased. By the end of February 1956 the British were involved in suppressing a veritable schoolchildren revolt that left one boy shot dead and the island&#x27;s school system almost completely closed down.

=== March 1956 to March 1957 (Operation Victory, phase II) ===

After the failure of Makarios-Harding negotiations the British government abruptly exiled Makarios to Seychelles on 9 March 1956. This triggered a week long general strike followed by a dramatic increase in EOKA activity: 246 attacks until 31 March including an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Harding. The offensive continued into April and May and the British casualties averaged two killed every week. While Harding&#x27;s forces were making ground up in the mountains, EOKA guerrillas and youth were trying to assassinate members of the security forces at their leisure time or alleged traitors.

EOKA focused its activity to urban areas during this period. House bombings and riots, mostly by schoolboys, forced army to keep forces away from the mountains where EOKA&#x27;s main fighters were hiding. Apart from individual citizens or soldiers in their leisure time, army and police facilities were attacked totaling 104 house bombings, 53 riots, 136 acts of Sabotage, 403 ambushes, 35 attacks on police, 38 attacks on soldiers and 43 raids on police stations. But as the pressure of Harding mounted, Grivas began targeting Turkish Cypriot policemen effectively sparking inter-communal riots and a series of strikes.

Harding escalated his fight against EOKA organizing a series of operations in April–July Harding also upgraded his intelligence network including the creation of the notorious X-platoon. On 10 May the first two EOKA prisoners were hanged and Grivas responded with the execution of two British soldiers. The British were concerned to counter EOKA&#x27;s mountain units. Large scale operations were launched however Grivas managed to escape. He decided to move to Limassol where he established his new headquarters. Although Grivas escaped, the Troodos operations had some success for the British: 20 guerrillas and 50 weapons were captured. However, they ended up with a disaster: at least 7 British soldiers were killed and additionally 21 were burned to death by accident. The last incident overshadowed the first real success against the EOKA guerrilla forces.

On 9 August the British authorities hanged three more EOKA prisoners; however, Grivas did not retaliate this time. Widespread strikes were held in protest. In November 1956 due to the Suez Crisis large numbers of British troops were transferred off Cyprus allowing Grivas to launch a new offensive. EOKA launched a wave of attacks in what would become for the British &quot;Black November&quot; with a total of 416 attacks, 39 killed, 21 of them British. After the Suez debacle, the British military strength was increased to 20,000 and Harding managed to direct a new offensive.

Although EOKA activity was severely suppressed in the mountains its armed struggle continued in the urban areas while the British forces were apparently impotent. Grivas declared truce on 14 March 1957 which lasted nearly one year.

=== From March 1957 to November 1957 ===
Harding continued to pressure EOKA despite the unilateral truce imposing security measures on villagers. This backfired at the British Forces as EOKA made gains in the field of propaganda.

Meanwhile, PEKA was continuing the struggle for Enosis with political means, while EOKA was trying to recruit new members. Priests and teachers, under strict secrecy, were the scouting for young men aged 14–24, and were mostly successful. Grivas reorganized EOKA&#x27;s structure. By Autumn, Grivas was increasing his autonomy from Greece and Makarios and was planning to attack the Left and the Turkish Cypriot community. The Greek government and Makarios were unable to prevent those initiatives.

==== Detention Camps and claims of torture ====
Detention of Persons Law, passed on 15 June 1955, gave the authority to the British authorities to enclose a suspect in a detention camp without a trial. PEKA and later Makarios and Greek Government pointed to the unhuman conditions in those camps. The situation of the inmates there was a matter of dispute International Committee of the Red Cross visited the camps twice and found no problems. Harding declined the torture allegations, describing it as propaganda by EOKA. Torture allegations had an impact in internal British politics. The precise use of torture methods remains a matter of dispute. According to Heinz Richter, while police or army was generally lawful, the British turned a blind eye to interrogators many of whom were deliberately under-educated Turkish Cypriots who were against &quot;Enosis&quot;. Another aspect that Richter highlights is that many claims of torture were made as the alleged victims were afraid for their lives as it was punished by death to speak to the British. David French on the other hand views that most – but not all – claims of torture were a propaganda tool of EOKA. In general Harding failed to win over the Greek Cypriot population especially when his security forces resorted to these measures.

Torture employed by the British in Cyprus included beatings, public floggings, clean beatings, forced standing, ice and drugs. Other torture included anal and vaginal insertion of hot eggs, a tactic also employed by the British in Kenya. A British Special Branch interrogator in Cyprus stated that he had devised the &quot;hot egg under the armpit technique&quot;. In a few instances electrotorture was also applied. Jack Taylor, a British policeman who was sent to Cyprus in September 1956 revealed that there were beatings of prisoners, while Brigadier Michael Harbottle confirmed that the Special Branch in Cyprus used torture. These statements confirm the use of torture in Cyprus by the British, although how widespread and frequent its use was remains unclear.

====Campaign against Greek Cypriot groups====
Initially, EOKA was intimidating the population not to co-operate with the security forces, but steadily the definition of traitor broadened as the security forces had some successes against EOKA at the end of 1956. EOKA members who had spoken to the security forces under interrogation were also considered as traitors and Grivas was in favour of the death penalty in such cases. Incidences happened where EOKA guerrillas killed others by their own initiative and not solely based on accusations for treason. The killings took place in public. Such activity peaked especially during summer-autumn 1956. The Greek Cypriot Left and in particular the communist party (AKEL) were also targeted. The latter aimed at a political role in the Greek Cypriot community challenging EOKA&#x27;s claim that Makarios was the sole leader of the community. As AKEL was growing in numbers it was practically denying Makarios&#x27; role. The British delicately fueled this hostility and in August 1957 a second wave of intra-Greek violence broke out. Another similar wave broke out in April–October 1958 when a peace agreement was imminent. AKEL held massive demonstrations and sought the help of Makarios which he granted. A number of scholars characterize EOKA as a terrorist organization due to attacks on public utilities, assassination of members of the security forces, civil servants and intimidation methods towards local population and targeting civilians.

====End of truce====
During this period the British were openly tolerating the Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organisations. The British had deliberately set out to use the Turkish Cypriot community on the island and the Turks government as a means of blocking the demand for Enosis. They had effectively allied themselves with the Turkish minority and turned them as the overwhelming majority in the police force. This had now got out of control as far as the British were concerned, but nevertheless they still managed to exploit the situation.

The truce against the colonial authorities lasted until 28 October 1957 (Ohi Day, Greek national holiday) when Harold Macmillan, British minister of foreign affairs, declined a proposal by Makarios.

===December 1957 – August 1958 (Foot governorship and intercommunal violence)===

Sir Hugh Foot arrived in Cyprus in December 1956, when it was obvious that a military victory for the British was not imminent. Grivas at that time was planning a gradual escalation of EOKA&#x27;s attacks on the British forces but in mid-December, he called for a truce to give space for negotiations to take place. The truce broke on 4 March 1958 when a new wave of attacks was unleashed but this time, Grivas ordered his guerrillas not to attack Turkish Cypriots to avoid intercommunal violence that could lead to partition.

==== EOKA and Turkish Cypriots ====

The Turkish Cypriot community objected to Enosis long before the 1950s from fear that unification with Greece would lead to their persecution and expulsion, a fear based on the fate of Cretan Turks after Crete&#x27;s union with Greece. Similarly, nationalism among Turkish Cypriots was constructed from various events that led to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Grass root paramilitary armed groups, such as Kıbrıs Türk Mukavemet Birliği (&quot;Turkish Cypriot Resistance Unit&quot;), Kara Çete (&quot;Black Gang&quot;) and Volkan, appeared as early as May 1955. All of them were absorbed later by TMT (Türk Mukavemet Teşkilatı/Turkish Resistance Organization) TMT was Turkey&#x27;s tool to fuel intercommunal violence in order to show that partition was the only possible arrangement. Like EOKA, TMT used violence against members of its own community (i.e. leftists) that were not willing to stay in line with their cause.

EOKA avoided conflict against the Turkish Cypriots but this changed later from January 1957. According to French, Grivas decided to attack Turkish Cypriots so as to spark intercommunal tensions and rioting in the towns of Cyprus, forcing the British to withdraw their troops from hunting EOKA up in the mountains and restore order in urban areas. From 19 January 1957 to the end of March, EOKA&#x27;s guerrillas attacked members of the Turkish community, starting with a Turkish Cypriot police officer, sparking riots lasting 3 days.

Intercommunal (and intra-communal) violence escalated in the summer of 1958 with numerous fatalities. French counted 55 assassinations by Turks on Greeks, and 59 assassinations by Greeks on Turks between 7 June-7 August. A substantial number of Turkish Cypriots were displaced due to the violence. In order to tackle the intercommunal clash, Foot mounted Operations &quot;Matchbox&quot; and &quot;Table Lighter&quot;. A truce was called in August, backed by the Greek and Turkish Governments.

=== From August 1958 to the Zurich and London Agreements ===

British authorities were unable to suppress EOKA activity, so the British government was trying to reach a solution that would not embarrass Britain. The MacMillan Plan put an effort in this direction. Greeks rejected the plan as they saw it as an open door leading to the partition of the island and Grivas cancelled the truce on 7 September. A new armed campaign was launched and the targets differed significantly from the previous periods. Grivas ordered guerrillas to &quot;strike indiscriminately at every English person wherever they can be found&quot; resulting in the death of 8 British citizens in 104 incidents attacks in the following two months. But while the military force of EOKA was growing, Greek Cypriots were getting frustrated from the intercommunal violence and the struggle against the British. Makarios hinted in an interview that he was ready to shift his stance and accept an independent Cyprus. This development infuriated Grivas but was backed by influential members of the Greek Cypriot Community. EOKA was losing its broad support base. 

During the last months of 1958, all parties had reasons to favour a compromise. Greek Cypriot side was afraid that partition was becoming more and more imminent, Greece was anxious that the ongoing situation could lead to a war with Turkey, Turkey had to manage the ongoing crises at its eastern borders and the British did not want to see NATO destabilizing because of Greek-Turkish war. On 5 December, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey acknowledged the situation and a series of meetings were arranged that resulted in London-Zürich Agreements. This was a compromise solution in which Cyprus would become an independent and sovereign country. Both Makarios and Grivas accepted the agreements with a heavy heart, but Turkish-Cypriot leadership was enthusiastic about the compromise. On 9 March 1959, Grivas issued a leaflet declaring his acceptance to London agreements.

According to historian Heinz Richter, the activities of EOKA resulted in the death of 104 British soldiers, 54 policemen (among them 15 Greek Cypriots, 22 Turkish Cypriots and 12 British) and 238 citizens (among them 26 British, 203 Greek Cypriots and 7 Turkish Cypriots)

== Aftermath ==

After Zurich-London agreement and the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, Makarios, who became the first president, staffed the Government and Civil service with EOKA members. Extremists of both communities stayed armed and continued to seek their ends, Enosis or Taksim. Ministers and other EOKA veterans joined the secret Akritas organisation, with Polycarpos Giorkatzis as new &quot;Digenis&quot;. As each community strived for opposite ends, the newly formed state soon collapsed, after Makarios changed the constitution unilaterally, paving the way to the intercommunal violence.

==Legacy==
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus consider the EOKA struggle as a struggle of national liberation and its members as heroic freedom fighters. The day of the beginning of the EOKA campaign, 1 April, is considered a national anniversary in the country today. Turkish narrative as written in a Turkish-Cypriot textbook considers the struggle of EOKA&#x27;s guerrillas as barbaric and illegal with the conclusion that &quot;Cyprus is and will remain Turkish&quot; (p. 61).&quot;

===Museums and Monuments===

A memorial museum dedicated to the EOKA campaign was created in 1960. It is located in the centre of Nicosia.

There are various monuments dedicated to the members of EOKA who died during the years of combat who are largely regarded as war-time heroes by Greek-Cypriots. Part of the central jail of Nicosia established by British governor Harding functions after the Cypriot independence as a museum. This includes the prisons cells, the gallows and the &quot;Incarcerated Graves&quot; of 13 EOKA fighters who were either executed or killed by the colonial authorities.

==Foreign Office declassified documents and EOKA lawsuits against the British government==
In 2012, Foreign Office released highly classified documents that described claims of torture and abuse between 1955–1959. In the reports it is revealed that officials of the colonial administration admitted to torture and abuse. In the same papers, there are allegations against British soldiers and security personnel concerning (among other incidents) the killing of a blind man, ordering a Greek Cypriot to dig his own grave, and hitting a pregnant woman who subsequently miscarried. Other allegations include the 1958 mass arrest and beating of 300 civilians by colonial forces. In the incident, it was alleged that the force involved left some civilians behind, thinking they were dead. A woman also alleged that she was raped in a forest, at the age of 16, by members of the Special Branch, and was subsequently subject to a &quot;brutal interrogation&quot; regarding her connection to EOKA which included a mock execution and forcibly wearing a noose. In another incident, a man lost his kidney following an interrogation at the notorious &quot;Red House&quot; building in Limassol.

Following the release of the documents, EOKA veterans announced that lawsuits were being planned against British authorities. The veterans association alleged that at least 14 Cypriots died and hundreds more could have been tortured during interrogations by the British during the 1955–1959 campaign. Two of those who allegedly died during interrogation were aged 17. The legal action comes on the back of the uncovering of secret documents released in 2011 which present similar practices during the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya, during the same period.

In 2018, Cypriot veterans won the right to claim damages over UK torture claims at court. The presiding judge dismissed arguments by the British government that the case should be judged under Cypriot law, which, if true, would have meant that the statute of limitations applied in the case. The judge commented that &quot;It seems to me that, in this case at any rate, where a state stands to be held to account for acts of violence against its citizens, it should be held to account in its own courts, by its own law and should not escape liability by reference to a colonial law it has itself made.&quot;

The case was settled out-of-court with the UK awarding Greek Cypriots with £1 million (to be distributed among alleged victims). The UK government denied any liability.

Declassified British archives have also revealed that the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret propaganda wing of the UK Foreign Office which dealt with Cold War propaganda, was responsible for spreading fake news claiming that EOKA rebels had raped schoolgirls as young as 12 years old. These black propaganda stories were spread to American journalists as a part of &quot;Operation TEA-PARTY&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
In Cyprus the EOKA struggle has, since its end, become a near mythological organisation due to its surprising victory and the motility from the Cypriot people of the then unborn nation for independence, and as such, there has been a plethora of movies, TV series and documentaries to the present day. EOKA has also been in British movies and documentaries but in antithesis, the approach of both being sympathetic to the British forces on the island and portraying EOKA as a terrorist organisation.
