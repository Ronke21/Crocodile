<text>The Lombard language (, , or , depending on the orthography; pronunciation: ) belongs to the Gallo-Italic group within the Romance languages. It is characterized by a Celtic linguistic substratum and a Lombardic linguistic superstratum and is a cluster of homogeneous dialects that are spoken by millions of speakers in Northern Italy and southern Switzerland. These include most of Lombardy and some areas of the neighbouring regions, notably the far eastern side of Piedmont and the extreme western side of Trentino, and in Switzerland in the cantons of Ticino and Graubünden. The language is also spoken in Santa Catarina in Brazil by Lombard immigrants from the Province of Bergamo, in Italy.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The most ancient linguistic substratum that has left a mark on the Lombard language is that of the ancient Ligures. However, available information about the ancient language and its influence on modern Lombard is extremely vague and limited. That is in sharp contrast to the influence left by the Celts, who settled in Northern Italy and brought their Celtic languages and culturally and linguistically Celticised the Ligures. The Celtic substratum of modern Lombard and the neighbouring languages of Northern Italy is self-evident and so the Lombard language is classified as a Gallo-Italic language (from the ancient Roman name for the Celts, Gauls).

Roman domination shaped the dialects spoken in the area, which is called Cisalpine Gaul (&quot;Gaul, this side of the mountains&quot;) by the Romans, and much of the lexicon and grammar of the Lombard language have their origin in Latin. However, that influence was not homogeneous since idioms of different areas were influenced by previous linguistic substrata, and each area was marked by a stronger or weaker Latinisation or the preservation of ancient Celtic characteristics.

The Germanic Lombardic language also left strong traces in modern Lombard, as it was the variety of Germanic that was spoken by the Germanic Lombards (or Longobards), who settled in Northern Italy, which is called Greater Lombardy after them, and in other parts of the Italian Peninsula after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Lombardic acted as a linguistic superstratum on Lombard and neighboring Gallo-Italic languages since the Germanic Lombards did not impose their language by law on the Gallo-Roman population, but they rather acquired the Gallo-Italic language from the local population. Lombardic left traces, mostly in lexicon and phonetics, without Germanicising the local language in its structure and so Lombard preserved its Romance structure.

=== From the 15th to the 17th century ===
From the 15th century onwards, literary Tuscan began to supplant the use of northern vernaculars such as Lombard, even regardless of the fact that Lombard itself began to be heavily influenced by the Tuscan vernacular. Prior to that, the Lombard language was widely used in administrative spheres. Among those who favoured the strengthening of Tuscan influences over Lombard culture was the Duke of Milan Ludovico il Moro; during his reign he brought numerous men of culture from the Republic of Florence to the Sforza court, the most famous of whom was certainly Leonardo da Vinci. At the same time, however, Lancino Curzio still wrote some works in Milanese dialect at the Sforza court.

Between the 15th and 16th centuries, the Lombard language was widely and actively discredited in Italian literary circles. Tuscan writers and humanists such as Luigi Pulci and Benedetto Dei recorded aspects of the language spoken in Milan in the form of parodies; similarly, the Asti-born writer Giorgio Alione parodied Milanese in his &quot;Commedia e farse carnovalesche nei dialetti astigiano, milanese e francese misti con latino barbaro&quot; (eng. &quot;Comedy and carnival farces in the Asti, Milanese and French dialects mixed with barbaric Latin&quot;) composed at the end of the 15th century. The Florentine humanist Leonardo Salviati, one of the founders of the Accademia della Crusca, an important Italian linguistic academy operating to this day, published a series of translations of a Boccaccian tale into various vernaculars (including Bergamo and Milanese) explicitly in order to demonstrate how ugly and awkward they were compared to Tuscan.

At the same time, the 15th century saw the first signs of a true Lombard literature: in the eastern parts of Lombardy, the Bergamo-born Giovanni Bressani composed numerous volumes of satirical poetry and the Brescia-born Galeazzo dagli Orzi wrote his &quot;Massera da bé&quot;, a sort of theatrical dialogue; in the west of the region area, the Mannerist painter Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo lead the composition of the &quot;arabesques&quot; in the Accademia dei Facchini della Val di Blenio, a Milanese academy founded in 1560.

At the beginning of the 17th century, the Ossola native Giovanni Capis published the &quot;Varon milanes de la lengua de Milan&quot; (eng. &quot;Varrone Milanese on the language of Milan&quot;), a sort of etymological dictionary was published. 
An example of a text in ancient Milanese dialect is this excerpt from &quot;Il falso filosofo&quot; (1698), act III, scene XIV, where Meneghino, a traditional Milanese character from the commedia dell&#x27;arte, presents himself in court (Lombard on the left, Italian translation on the right):
The 17th century also saw the rise of the figure of the playwright Carlo Maria Maggi, who normalised the spelling of the Milanese dialect and who created, among other things, the Milanese mask of Meneghino. A friend and correspondent of Maggi was Francesco De Lemene, author of La sposa Francesca (the first literary work in modern Lodi dialect) and of a translation of &quot;Gerusalemme liberata&quot;. Moreover, the 17th century saw the emergence of the first bosinade: popular poems written on loose sheets and posted in the squares or read (or even sung) in public; they were widely diffused until the first decades of the 20th century.

=== In the modern era ===
Milanese literature in the 18th century was quickly developing: some important names which emerged in that period include Domenico Balestrieri, who was associated the famous poet Giuseppe Parini. The latter wrote some compositions in the Lombard language. One of the most important writers of the period was the Bergamo-based abbot Giuseppe Rota, author of a substantial (unpublished) Bergamo-Italian-Latin vocabulary and of several poetic works in the Orobic idiom, which he always called &quot;lingua&quot;.

In this period the linguistic characteristics of Lombard were well recognizable and comparable to the modern ones, except for some phonetic peculiarities and the presence of a remote past tense, replaced almost fully by the past perfect tense by 1875.

The beginning of the 19th century was dominated by the figure of Carlo Porta, recognized by many as the most important author of Lombard literature, also included among the greatest poets of Italian national literature. With him some of the highest peaks of expressiveness in the Lombard language were reached, which clearly emerged in works such as &quot;La Ninetta del Verzee, Desgrazzi de Giovannin Bongee&quot;, &quot;La guerra di pret&quot; and &quot;Lament del Marchionn de gamb avert&quot;.

Milanese poetic production assumed such important dimensions that in 1815 the scholar Francesco Cherubini published an anthology of Lombard literature in four volumes, which included texts written from the seventeenth century to his day.

=== In the contemporary era ===
In the first part of the 20th century, the greatest exponent of Lombard literature was the Milanese lawyer Delio Tessa, who distanced himself from the Portian tradition by giving his texts a strong expressionist tone. In Bergamo, the most prominent advocate of Lombard language was Bortolo Belotti, a lawyer, historian and minister in the liberal governments of the time.

The Lombard language became known outside its linguistic borders thanks to I Legnanesi, a theatre company that performed comedies in the Legnanese dialect and which is the most famous example of travesti theatre in Italy. In their comic shows the actors propose to the public satirical figures of the typical Lombard court; founded in Legnano in 1949 by Felice Musazzi, Tony Barlocco and Luigi Cavalleri, it is among the most famous companies in the European dialect theatre scene.

The 21st century has also seen the use of Lombard in contemporary music, such as in the musical pieces of Davide Van De Sfroos and in the translations into Lombard of the works of Bob Dylan. There is no shortage of translations of great literary classics; in fact, there are numerous versions in Lombard of works such as Pinocchio, The Betrothed, The Little Prince, the Divine Comedy and – in religious literature – of the Gospels.

== Status ==
Lombard is considered a minority language that is structurally separate from Italian by both Ethnologue and the UNESCO &quot;Red Book on Endangered Languages&quot;. However, Italy and Switzerland do not recognize Lombard-speakers as a linguistic minority. In Italy, that is the same as for most other minority languages, which have been for a long time incorrectly classed as corrupted regional dialects of Italian. However, Lombard and Italian belong to different subgroups of the Romance language family, and Lombard&#x27;s historical development is not related to Standard Italian, which is derived from Tuscan.

=== Speakers ===

Historically, the vast majority of Lombards spoke only Lombard, as &quot;Italian&quot; was merely a literary language, and most Italians were not able to read or write. After the Italian economic miracle, Standard Italian arose throughout Italy and Lombard-speaking Switzerland, wholly-monolingual Lombard-speakers became a rarity as time went by, but a small minority may still be uncomfortable speaking Standard Italian. Surveys in Italy find that all Lombard-speakers also speak Italian, and their command of both two languages varies according to their geographical position as well as their socio-economic situation. The most reliable predictor was found to be the speaker&#x27;s age. Studies have found that young people are much less likely to speak Lombard as proficiently as their grandparents. In some areas, elderly people are more used to speaking Lombard than Italian even though they know both.

== Classification ==

Lombard belongs to the Gallo-Italic (Cisalpine) group of Gallo-Romance languages, which belongs to the Western Romance subdivision.

===Varieties===
Traditionally, the Lombard dialects have been classified into the Eastern, Western, Alpine and Southern Lombard dialects.

The varieties of the Italian provinces of Milan, Varese, Como, Lecco, Lodi, Monza and Brianza, Pavia and Mantua belong to Western Lombard, and the provinces of Bergamo, Brescia and Cremona are dialects of Eastern Lombard. All varieties spoken in the Swiss areas (both in the Canton of Ticino and the Canton of Graubünden) are Western, and both Western and Eastern varieties are found in the Italian areas.

The varieties of the Alpine valleys of Valchiavenna and Valtellina (Sondrio) and upper-Valcamonica (Brescia) and the four Lombard valleys of the Swiss canton of Graubünden have some peculiarities of their own and some traits in common with Eastern Lombard but should be considered Western. Also, dialects from the Piedmontese provinces of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and Novara, the Valsesia valley (province of Vercelli), and the city of Tortona are closer to Western Lombard than to Piedmontese. Alternatively, following the traditional classification, the varieties spoken in parts of Sondrio, Trentino, Ticino and Grigioni can be considered as Alpine Lombard, and those spoken in southern Lombardy such as in Pavia, Lodi, Cremona and Mantova can be classified as Southern Lombard.

== Literature ==

Lacking a standard language, authors in the 13th and 14th language created Franco-Lombard, a mixed language including Old French, for their literary works.
The Lombard variety with the oldest literary tradition (from the 13th century) is that of Milan, but Milanese, the native Lombard variety of the area, has now almost completely been superseded by Italian from the heavy influx of migrants from other parts of Italy (especially from Apulia, Sicily and Campania) during the rapid industrialization after the Second World War.

Ticinese is a comprehensive denomination for the Lombard varieties that are spoken in Swiss canton Ticino (Tessin), and the &quot;Ticinese koiné&quot; is the Western Lombard koiné used by speakers of local dialects (particularly those diverging from the &quot;koiné&quot; itself) when they communicate with speakers of other Lombard dialects of Ticino, Grigioni or Italian Lombardy. The koiné is similar to Milanese and the varieties of the neighbouring provinces on the Italian side of the border.

There is extant literature in other varieties of Lombard like &quot;La masséra da bé&quot;, a theatrical work in early Eastern Lombard, written by Galeazzo dagli Orzi (1492–?) presumably in 1554.

== Usage ==

Standard Italian is widely used in Lombard-speaking areas. However, the status of Lombard is quite different in the Swiss and Italian areas and so the Swiss areas have now become the real strongholds of Lombard.

=== In Switzerland ===
 In the Swiss areas, the local Lombard varieties are generally better preserved and more vital than in Italy. No negative feelings are associated with the use of Lombard in everyday life, even with complete strangers. Some radio and television programmes, particularly comedies, are occasionally broadcast by the Swiss Italian-speaking broadcasting company in Lombard. Moreover, it is common for people to answer in Lombard in spontaneous interviews. Even some television advertisements have been broadcast in Lombard. The major research institution working on Lombard dialects is in Bellinzona, Switzerland (&quot;CDE – Centro di dialettologia e di etnografia&quot;, a governmental (cantonal) institution); there is no comparable institution in Italy. In December 2004, it released a dictionary in five volumes, covering all Lombard varieties spoken in the Swiss areas.

=== In Italy ===

Today, in most urban areas of Italian Lombardy, people under 40 years old speak almost exclusively Italian in their daily lives because of schooling and television broadcasts in Italian. However, in rural areas, Lombard is still vital and used alongside Italian.

Lombard is spoken in Campione d&#x27;Italia, an exclave of Italy that is surrounded by Swiss territory on Lake Lugano.

== Phonology ==
The following tables show the sounds that are used in all Lombard dialects.

=== Consonants ===

In Eastern Lombard and Pavese dialect , and merge to and , and merge to . In Eastern Lombard, the last sound is often further debuccalized to .

=== Vowels ===

In Western varieties, vowel length is contrastive (Milanese &quot;to go&quot; and &quot;gone&quot;), but Eastern varieties normally use only short allophones.

Two repeating orthographic vowels are separated by a dash to prevent them from being confused with a long vowel: &quot;a-a&quot; in &quot;ca-àl&quot; &quot;horse&quot;.

Western long and short tend to be back and lower , respectively, and and may merge to .

=== Alternative spelling systems ===
There have been contemporary attempts to develop alternative spelling systems suitable for use by all variants of Lombard. Among these, there is the attempt to develop a unified spelling (lomb. urtugrafia ünificada), which has not taken root due to the excessive complexity and lack of intuitiveness (as well as the lack of adaptability to the Italian keyboard) of the system, which uses symbols such as ç for /z/ and /ʧ/, or ə for unstressed /a/, /ə/ and /e/, as well as the obligation to mark the vowel length, despite the elimination of the accents on the first grapheme of the digraph (aa and not àa).

<text>Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae.

&quot;Arctotis&quot; is native to dry stony slopes in southern Africa. Some of the plants are alternatively placed in the genus &quot;Venidium&quot;. The common name is &quot;African daisy&quot;, or &quot;Gousblom&quot; in Afrikaans. These plants have daisy-like composite flowers which tend to close in the late afternoon or in dull weather, but numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use which stay open for longer, and are available in a wide range of colours. Tender perennials are often grown in temperate regions as half-hardy annuals.

The garden hybrid &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;hybrida&quot; hort. &#x27;Flame&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

Vigorous &quot;Arctotis&quot; hybrids like &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27; and &#x27;Large Marge&#x27; are popular choices for garden design for the diverse colors of their blooms.

<text>Risdon Cove is a cove located on the east bank of the Derwent River, approximately north of Hobart, Tasmania. It was the site of the first British settlement in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, now Tasmania, the island state of Australia. The cove was named by John Hayes, who mapped the river in the ship &quot;Duke of Clarence&quot; in 1794, after his second officer William Bellamy Risdon.

In 1803 Lieutenant John Bowen was sent to establish a settlement in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. On the advice of the explorer George Bass he had chosen Risdon Cove. While the site was a good one from a defensive point of view, the soil was poor and water scarce.
 anchored at Risdon on the eastern shore of the Derwent River on Wednesday 8 September 1803, five days before the whaler arrived with Lt. Bowen on board.
The 49 people aboard the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; and Albion made a curious party of soldiers, sailors, settlers and convicts.

In 1804 Lieutenant Colonel David Collins arrived in the Derwent from Port Phillip on &quot;Ocean&quot;. Within a few days he rejected Risdon Cove as a suitable settlement site, for its inadequate source of fresh water, and moved his party across the river to Sullivans Cove. The military and convicts disembarked from &quot;Ocean&quot; near Hunter Island on 20–21 February 1804 and thus beginning what is now Hobart. &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; landed the free settlers at New Town Bay on 22 February.

One of the first land grants at Risdon Cove was made to Dr William F A I&#x27;Anson, the chief surgeon who arrived with Lieutenant-Governor Collins in 1804.

== 19th century ==

On 3 May 1804 a number of aboriginal Tasmanians were killed by guards of the fledgling British settlement. The events occurred in mysterious circumstances, perhaps as the result of a misunderstanding. The original records show that a large group of Aboriginals walked into the fledgling settlement. The settlement&#x27;s guards mistakenly thought they were under attack and killed some of the intruders.

== 20th century ==
The site at Risdon Cove was farmed until 1946. By the 150th anniversary celebrations (September 1954) land had been acquired by the State Government to add to the reserve. Angela McGowan excavated the site in 1978-80.

The hand-over of the Risdon Cove site, which includes the Bowen Memorial, was part of the Aboriginal Lands Act 1995. The transfer occurred on 11 December 1995, and since then Aboriginal Tasmanians have maintained and developed the site as a cultural and an educational facility.

==Plot==


===Season 1===
The series begins with the arrival of Dr. Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Brown (Treat Williams), a widower who leaves his successful job as a top Manhattan neurosurgeon to live in a small Colorado town, bringing his nine-year-old daughter Delia (Vivien Cardone) and 15-year-old son Ephram (Gregory Smith) with him. He chooses the town of Everwood because his late wife had told him of her emotional attachment to the town. Many of the story lines revolve around settling into a new town, dealing with the death of the mother and wife of the family, and the growing relationship between Andy and his son, who did not interact much in New York, due to the demands of Andy&#x27;s job. Andy at first finds some conflict with Dr. Harold Abbott (Tom Amandes), with whom his professional opinions differ. However, Harold&#x27;s cranky demeanor and Andy&#x27;s passive, cheerful attitude prove to mesh well, and the two begin a friendly rivalry. Ephram continually struggles with his emerging adolescence, his studies as a classical pianist, and his crush on Amy (Emily VanCamp), Harold&#x27;s daughter.

The first season revolves around the main storyline involving Colin Hart (Mike Erwin), Amy&#x27;s boyfriend and older brother Bright&#x27;s (Chris Pratt) best friend. Amy sees the arrival of Andy as an opportunity: Colin has been in a coma since July 4 of the previous summer, after Bright and he were in a car accident. Amy befriends Ephram in an effort to convince Andy to revive his neurosurgeon skills to save Colin. Andy reluctantly agrees. Amy is elated, but Bright is sullen and distant about the situation. Later, he tearfully confesses to his father that—contrary to what he had claimed all summer—he does in fact remember the accident: He was the one driving Colin&#x27;s father&#x27;s truck and the two boys were drunk at the time. His anguish is relieved when Andy is successful, and soon Colin is awake.

In the meantime, Ephram&#x27;s maternal grandparents come to visit their new home in the fall and Ephram decides he wants to move back to New York City to live with them. Ephram&#x27;s grandfather—also a surgeon—berates Andy into letting Ephram go. Delia and her grandmother befriend Edna Harper (Debra Mooney), a semi-retired Army nurse and Harold&#x27;s estranged mother. They decide to throw her a surprise birthday party at the Browns&#x27; home. During the party, in front of all the guests, Ephram and Andy have a loud fight about his moving to New York City. The two stalk to different parts of the house with no decision resolved. Andy and his father-in-law also begin to fight about the situation but are interrupted because Bright has collapsed. He needs his appendix removed, but the snow has prevented travel to the nearest hospital, so they do emergency surgery on him in Andy&#x27;s office. Andy sees how concerned and loving Harold is toward his son and resolves to try and patch things up with Ephram. He confesses that he will be &quot;half a person&quot; if Ephram leaves, and as a result Ephram decides to stay.

Andy meets his next-door neighbor Nina Feeney (Stephanie Niznik) after a loud fight with Ephram in the front yard. She is friendly but outspoken and honest. Nina eventually explains that she is serving as a surrogate mother for a woman who was unable to conceive. A scandal erupts when Nina has the baby and it is revealed that the mother is well over fifty, but Andy supports Nina&#x27;s decision.

All is not well for Colin. He returns home and re-enrolls in school, but he has lost most of his memory, including his memory of Amy. Under pressure to step back into his old life, Colin befriends Ephram since the latter is the only person who does not have a preconceived notion of him. Amy, meanwhile, struggles with emerging feelings for Ephram as he has an unsuccessful relationship with Colin&#x27;s sister, Laynie. His lingering attachment to Amy flares up at inopportune moments, causing Laynie to break it off.

Soon Colin begins lashing out violently and acting out emotionally and loses his friendship with Ephram. Ephram tries to let his friends know that Colin is not acting normally, but Amy believes he is just jealous of her relationship with Colin and that Colin is &quot;under a lot of stress&quot;. Bright, frustrated at Colin&#x27;s friendship with Ephram in the first place, refuses to listen as well, until Colin accosts Ephram outside the local diner, proceeding to uncharacteristically punch Bright in the face when he objects to Colin&#x27;s roughness. Andy believes Ephram (also following a grievous, self-inflicted hand injury during a homecoming ceremony) and brings the subject up with Colin&#x27;s parents. They are unwilling to believe that Colin is anything but fully recovered and fire Andy from Colin&#x27;s care. Physical symptoms begin to manifest as well, and eventually Colin collapses. It is learned there are complications from the first surgery. Colin&#x27;s parents ask Andrew to operate again, but then he experiences complications during the surgery.

===Season 2===
The beginning of Season 2 reveals Colin&#x27;s fate. The entire town blames Andy for &quot;killing&quot; Colin. They stop going to his practice and shun his children. Andy stands by his decision and eventually admits to Ephram that he could have saved Colin&#x27;s life, but he would have been mentally and physically disabled and, at Colin&#x27;s insistence, promised that he would not let him live that way.

Amy struggles with Colin&#x27;s death and falls into a deep depression, eventually going on medication and meeting Tommy Callahan, a drug-dealing loner who becomes more than a friend. She considers sleeping with Tommy but backs out of it every time he brings it up. Harold buys her a new car to try and cheer her up, but Amy continues to act out and fail in school. Rose (Merrilyn Gann), Harold&#x27;s wife and the town mayor, tells her husband that he is babying her and she is unwelcome in her house until she follows the rules, which forces Amy to move in with Edna. Amy&#x27;s downward spiral continues until Tommy takes her to a wild party. He gives her a bottle of water laced with GHB. Already intoxicated, Amy drinks it, then has a hallucination of Colin, who tells her to let him go and to get on with her life. The vision shocks her back to reality, and she realizes that Tommy has drunk most of the water himself and subsequently overdosed. Amy does the only thing she can think of and calls her father for help. Tommy recovers, but Amy is scared straight. She dumps him, moves back in with her parents, and begins to improve her behavior and mood.

Ephram, meanwhile, has found love with Madison, a 20-year-old college student whom Andy has hired to babysit Delia. She is a girl whom Ephram initially despises for her condescending attitude toward him. After a few false starts, he eventually loses his virginity to her.

The second season has several other important plot developments. Andy finds a new love interest in Linda Abbott, Harold&#x27;s globe-trotting sister, also a doctor but practicing in Africa. A scandal at Harold and Linda&#x27;s office occurs when it is revealed to the populace of Everwood that Linda had contracted HIV from a victim of an African civil war incident. As a result, Harold loses his liability insurance coverage, and Linda quits her holistic health practice and leaves town, also ending her romance with Andy. Harold tries to open a new bagel shop but meets with failure. Andy then invites him as a partner, since Andy&#x27;s insurance would cover Harold&#x27;s practice. Harold reluctantly agrees.

Nina goes through a divorce with her recently outed husband Carl and has to go to court over custody of her son Sam, a case which she eventually wins with Andy&#x27;s support.

A lonely Bright grows more tolerant of Ephram, and the two eventually become good friends.

Ephram continues his on-and-off relationship with Madison. In an effort to prove how mature he is, he sneaks into bars to see her band and produces many awkward moments by showing up when she is out with her college friends. Finally she decides that the timing of their relationship is off and breaks up with Ephram. She tries to continue working with the Browns, but Delia fires her, saying that she likes Madison but that Madison&#x27;s presence makes Ephram sad. She later confesses to Andy that she is pregnant with Ephram&#x27;s child. Andy tells her he will pay for all her expenses if she agrees to keep the pregnancy from Ephram. He believes that Ephram was forced to grow up very quickly by the death of his mother and that—if he learns of the pregnancy—his sense of decency will compel him to stay with Madison, something for which Andy believes he is not ready.

Amy asks Ephram to stay in Everwood, so that they can figure out if a romantic relationship would work between them. However, he is accepted to a summer program at the Juilliard School of Music. He is torn between going to New York and staying with Amy. When he leaves to study music at Juilliard, Amy accompanies him for ten days in Manhattan and, after she returns to Everwood, they continue their relationship long-distance.

===Season 3===
The third season opens with Andy receiving a letter from Madison telling him that she is in Denver, and is not going to tell him her decision regarding the pregnancy and she wants no further contact. Andy contemplates telling Ephram, but Harold convinces him not to do so, for the sake of Ephram and Amy.

Ephram returns from his summer classes at Juilliard with the disappointing news that he did not receive high marks and begins to intensify his piano studies, which places a strain on his relationship with Amy. The two, now in their senior year of high school, befriend an extremely shy girl, named Hannah (Sarah Drew), who is staying with Nina. Hannah is a junior and tells Amy that her parents are travelling in Hong Kong, but later reveals that her father, with whom she was extremely close, suffers from late-stage Huntington&#x27;s Disease and she was in fact sent to Everwood so she wouldn&#x27;t have to watch his suffering. With the support of Amy, Ephram, Harold, and Bright, Hannah decides to get tested and discovers that she didn&#x27;t inherit the Huntington&#x27;s gene from her father. 

After much discussion with Hannah, Amy decides to sleep with Ephram and they sneak away to the Abbotts&#x27; lake cabin, but Amy gets cold feet and backs out. Ephram is understanding and in the morning she has a change of heart and loses her virginity to Ephram. Around Christmas, Bright tells Ephram where Madison&#x27;s band is playing and he goes to see her and lies to Amy about it. Ephram misses seeing Madison, but feeling guilty confesses where he went to Amy. Amy is extremely upset telling Ephram that he is devoting all his time to the piano, while she has had to give up her hobbies and school activities to make time for their relationship and resents this. Ephram agrees to set aside more time for them and they make up. 

Bright gets a job at the County Clerk&#x27;s office with his mother Rose. His promiscuity catches up to him when one young intern accuses him of sexual harassment. Bright maintains that she misunderstood his actions, does not admit guilt and is cleared by an investigation. Rose, embarrassed and hurt, realizes that Bright has long treated women badly, and fires him anyway to teach him a lesson. Bright resolves to do better. 

The third season also sees the arrival of a new, younger doctor named Jake Hartman, whom neither Harold nor Andy like very much, due to his over-zealous attitude. He takes up residence in Harold&#x27;s former office. Nina, despite her feelings for Andy, believes that she has a future with Jake and begins dating him. 

Andy treats a patient, John Hayes, who has serious incapacitation caused by a stroke. Andy finds himself drawn to John&#x27;s wife Amanda, which they at first resist but eventually succumb to temptation. Andy&#x27;s guilt leads to an ulcer. Andy gets John admitted into a cutting-edge treatment program out of town and they resume the affair. John&#x27;s recovery is miraculous and Amanda returns to her husband. 

Ephram is granted an audition with the Juilliard School in New York City, where he runs into Madison. Andy, who accompanied Ephram, tries to patch things up with Madison and encourages her to tell Ephram about the pregnancy. She invites Ephram for coffee and tells him about the pregnancy and that the baby has been adopted by a couple in Marin, California. She conceals Andy&#x27;s role in her keeping it secret and leaving, but when Andy learns what Madison has said, he confesses to Ephram. Ephram is livid and bails on his audition to punish Andy for prioritizing his piano playing over his relationship with Madison. Back in Everwood, Ephram tells Amy, who reluctantly agrees to help Ephram locate the baby and the adoptive parents, but the two soon argue about it and break up. 

Rose is diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on her spine and must undergo chemotherapy, which proves to be initially unsuccessful. With some reluctance, Andy agrees to do the surgery to remove the tumor. Harold is incensed until the operation appears to be a success, and Rose slowly recovers.

Ephram, still angry with his father, skips graduation and sells his piano to buy a ticket to London and go backpacking around Europe. Amy graduates from high school and gets into Princeton University.

Jake agrees to give up his LA lifestyle, and settle down with Nina. They start a restaurant together, in the diner where Nina used to waitress. 

Hannah gets a boyfriend for the first time, but breaks up with him because she is still attracted to Bright, who decides to commit to a romantic relationship with her. Amy decides to defer her first semester at Princeton, so that she can help take care of her mother while she convalesces. With Ephram in Europe and Nina living with Jake, Andy considers accepting a job offer in Chicago and moving on, but Harold and others persuade him to stay in Everwood. He tells Nina that he still loves her.

===Season 4===
The fourth season opens with Edna and her husband Irv planning a vow-renewal ceremony. Rose is recovering well, and Jake has moved in with Nina. Amy lives at home while attending Colorado A&amp;M, instead of Princeton, to help Rose during her convalescence. Bright starts his second year at Everwood Community College and has moved into an apartment. A medical student, Reid, has caught Amy&#x27;s eye, and Amy convinces Bright to let Reid be his roommate. At the request of Delia, who desperately misses him, Ephram returns from Europe in time to attend the end of Irv and Edna&#x27;s ceremony.

When Ephram returns Andy tells him that he is welcome at home, but he will not pay Ephram&#x27;s living expenses anywhere else. Andy doesn&#x27;t want to damage Ephram and Delia&#x27;s relationship, so he tells Ephram that he will pay him $50 for every dinner they eat together as a family. After Amy tells Ephram that it was her idea to get a job, not her father&#x27;s, Ephram refuses Andy&#x27;s money, becomes a piano teacher, and starts his first semester at Everwood Community College with Bright, who asks him to be a third roommate. Reid and Amy date casually. Ephram begins giving piano lessons to a high-school freshman, Kyle Hunter. Although talented, Kyle is sullen and difficult. By helping out Kyle, Ephram gains a new appreciation for what he put his own father through. Also, Andy has a patient who is estranged from his daughter because he kept a secret from her for her whole life. Andy asks Ephram to talk to the daughter about forgiveness, and in the process, Ephram begins to let go of some of the resentment he felt towards Andy and their relationship continues to improve.

On a father/son camping trip with the Abbotts, Ephram reveals that he came back to Everwood because he is still in love with Amy, and Bright reveals that he might break up with Hannah because she doesn&#x27;t believe in premarital sex. Back in town Ephram asks Reid not to date Amy at all and he backs off. Amy and Ephram repair their friendship. Studying together late one night, they wind up sleeping together. Afterward Ephram, wanting to repair their romantic relationship as well, gives Amy a Christmas present and reveals that he wrote her postcards while in Europe but never sent them to her. She asks to take them home and read them but later explains that she does not want to become romantically involved with Ephram again because she is trying to figure out her own identity.

Harold and Rose struggle to get past her illness. Despite her recovery she loses her re-bid for mayor of Everwood and feels lost and useless. After a vacation on an African safari, Rose tells Harold that she wants to adopt a child.

Nina and Jake&#x27;s restaurant is doing well. Jake begins acting erratic and distant. When one of his visiting Los Angeles buddies has a serious biking accident, Jake is lost and stressed out. It is revealed that he is a recovering narcotics addict and he has &quot;fallen off the wagon&quot;. When he finally tells Nina the truth, she kicks him out of the house and cries in Andy&#x27;s arms.

Meanwhile, Irv has written a fictional book loosely based on his experiences in Everwood. The book, entitled &quot;A Mountain Town&quot;, goes on to be a thundering success.

Although they seem quite mismatched, Bright and Hannah continue to date. Her father finally passes away and Hannah&#x27;s mother lets her choose to move home or stay in Everwood. Hannah decides to stay. Bright is elated, but he is also frustrated at Hannah&#x27;s low self-esteem and forces her to see that she is beautiful by locking her in the bathroom and refusing to let her out until she looks at herself in the mirror. Hannah takes it one step further and invites Bright into the shower with her.

Ephram learns that his old piano teacher, Will Cleveland, has died and attends his wake. Instead of a sad and somber event, it is a celebration of his life, and Ephram is introduced to Will&#x27;s family as his star pupil. They coax him to play a piece, and it rekindles his love of the instrument. He re-buys a piano, and he helps Kyle prepare for a Juilliard audition. Kyle is still moody, and Ephram often returns to the Brown home to talk to Andy about his struggles and practice his own playing. When he convinces Kyle to meet his absentee father and Kyle is stood up, Ephram confesses to Andy that he thinks about his own child all the time and was using his experience with Kyle to work through his feelings of guilt and irresponsibility. Ephram also tries to help develop Kyle&#x27;s social skills, since he is always alone and awkward around his classmates. When Reid suggests Kyle might be gay, Ephram says he&#x27;s too young, attempting to shield him from adversity. Kyle initially denies it as well but eventually decides to come out. With their difficulties behind them, Ephram coaches Kyle successfully into Juilliard. After meeting a concert pianist, Ephram decides to transfer to Colorado A&amp;M and major in music education. In addition Ephram leaves Madison a voicemail, apologizing for his explosive reaction to their situation.

Bright breaks his hand trying to karate chop a piece of wood and wears a sling for several weeks. Hannah babies him incessantly, and they have a minor spat. Hannah obsesses over their relationship, and Bright runs into an old acquaintance, Ada (Kelly Carlson), an attractive blonde who once sold Bright and Ephram fake IDs. After a few beers together, he has a moment of weakness in judgment and lust and winds up sleeping with Ada. Ephram finds out, but Bright, although regretful, decides he isn&#x27;t going to tell Hannah. Ephram disagrees, and they stop speaking. Amy wheedles the truth out of Ephram and declares that, if Bright doesn&#x27;t tell Hannah, she will. Under pressure Bright admits the truth, and Hannah breaks up with him. She tells him she doesn&#x27;t want him in her life at all, even as just a friend.

Reid begins to fail medical school and, as a last-ditch effort, cheats on a test. He is caught and expelled but pretends that everything is fine. Ephram finds Reid one morning on the bathroom floor unconscious after having taken an entire bottle of sleeping pills. Ephram feels immense guilt for not realizing that Reid was depressed. Upon recovery Reid again tries to pretend that everything is just fine and asks Amy out on a date. It is predictably a disaster, and Amy tells Reid that she learned from Colin&#x27;s death that he has to deal with the things that made him try to commit suicide in the first place. Reid decides to move back home with his mother until he is fully recovered.

Harold and Rose&#x27;s adoption is in the final stages when it is revealed that Harold lied about Rose&#x27;s cancer on the admission forms. They lose their opportunity and are heartbroken. Rose develops a bruise on her back and convinces herself that her cancer is active. At the same time, Bright drinks excessively at his 21st birthday party—still hurt by his breakup with Hannah—and stands on a chair at a bar. With his arm in a sling, he loses his balance and falls through a plate glass window. He is rushed to the hospital with a head injury. At the hospital, Rose shares her fears, and Harold tells her that she is fine—the doctor called right before Bright&#x27;s accident. Subsequently, both Bright and Rose make successful recoveries. A schizophrenic patient of Harold&#x27;s is overwhelmed with her new baby and the sudden death of her husband. She panics and leaves the baby girl on the Abbotts&#x27; doorstep. After a half-hearted search for her, Harold and Rose apply for custody of the baby.

After returning from his book tour, Irv and Edna decide to buy an RV and travel the country. Just after purchasing it, Irv collapses from a second heart attack and dies. Edna maintains her usual, tough persona until Harold confronts her on her erratic behavior. She confesses that she is overwhelmed with grief. Harold and Rose fix up a guest bedroom in their house and invite Edna to live with them, thus ending a years-long battle between mother and son.

Nina agrees to forgive Jake and to take him back, and he begins a variety of recovery programs but is unsurprised when none of them work since they didn&#x27;t in the past. He decides to start a recovery group in Everwood, and then begins to design a program on his own. His old friends in Los Angeles are receptive to the idea, but they want him to move back. Jake asks Nina to come with him, and she sells her house and agrees. Andy—faced with the loss of Nina—impulsively buys her an engagement ring and shows it to Ephram, saying he simply needed to act on his feelings, even if he had no intention of asking her. At Irv&#x27;s funeral Ephram tells Nina about the ring, who tells Hannah, who convinces Nina to sneak in and look at it. Hannah ends up with the ring in her room, and Jake finds it while packing. He confronts Andy and Nina, and the latter insists that it means nothing. They make it to the airport when Jake realizes that he doesn&#x27;t want to be with someone who is so unsure and boards the plane alone. Nina shows up back at the Browns—a sleeping Sam in tow—as her house has already been sold. Andy takes a cathartic trip to New York to say goodbye to his late wife Julia one last time before flying back to Everwood to propose to Nina on the very spot they met. She happily agrees.

After his accident, Bright and Hannah decide to be friends again but do not rekindle their relationship. When Bright tells Hannah that he is transferring to Colorado A&amp;M, Hannah passes up a full scholarship to Notre Dame and applies to Colorado A&amp;M to stay in Everwood. The fate of Hannah and Bright&#x27;s romantic relationship was left open.

Ephram meets Stephanie while she is hanging ads for a new roommate. She is feisty and fun without drama; Ephram likes how refreshingly easy she is to be around. Delia invites her to her bat mitzvah, and while there a slightly tipsy Amy realizes she is still in love with Ephram. She struggles with this realization until she thinks of the exact best way to tell Ephram how she feels. Recreating a moment they shared during a festival soon after he first moved there, she enlists Rose&#x27;s help in ordering a Ferris wheel, stationing it outside his apartment. With this as her backdrop, she confesses that all their problems are her fault and asks him to give her another chance at a relationship, without the drama. Ephram, having loved Amy since the day he met her, easily agrees to be with her again, and the season and series end with Ephram and Amy embarking on a mature, adult relationship.

===Series finale===
&quot;Everwood&#x27;s&quot; series finale, which aired on Monday, June 5, 2006, was seen by 4.07 million viewers.

The final episode, &quot;Foreverwood&quot;, was written as both a season and a series finale. Because of the impending WB/UPN merger into the CW Television Network, the future of the series was uncertain, and the producers wrote two endings. Originally, the producers had scripted a montage for the &quot;series-finale cut&quot; that went forty years into the future to show a majority of the regular characters at Andy&#x27;s funeral, showing the series coming full circle; this was never filmed due to budgetary reasons as well as the producers&#x27; hopes that they would receive a fifth season.

&quot;Everwood&quot; was canceled in favor of a new show, &quot;Runaway&quot;, which Dawn Ostroff then canceled after only three episodes had been shown, and for a new season of &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, which had just had its series finale. The finale of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; had 7 million viewers. &quot;Everwood&quot; had an average of 4 million viewers (which, if it was sustained, would have put it in the top 5 CW ratings for the following year).

==Home media==

In Region 4, Warner Home Video has released the first season on DVD in Australia.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Robert Bianco for &quot;USA Today&quot; was not enthusiastic about the show&#x27;s premiere and gave it a two-star rating out of four. He found that &quot;Everwood&quot;″s main problem was that it &quot;never knows when the corn syrup is thick enough&quot; due to its clichés. On the more positive side, he wrote, &quot;Clearly, WB&#x27;s goal here is to find an acceptable time-period companion for &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and it&#x27;s entirely possible the network has. The scenery is pretty, Smith has the earmarks of a star in the making, and Williams actually is quite appealing—when the script isn&#x27;t forcing him to behave as if he were insane.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; was critical of the pilot episode and accused it of being a &quot;bit excessive and sentimental&quot; and self-consciously quirky, but that &quot;it&#x27;s beautifully acted, crisply written and has first-rate production values.&quot;

Advocacy group the Parents Television Council ranked &quot;Everwood&quot; as the group&#x27;s No. 1 &quot;worst network TV show for family viewing&quot; on their list of the 2003–04 season. The PTC criticized &quot;the careless and irresponsible treatment of sexual issues—especially when the teenaged characters are involved&quot; and stated &quot;&quot;Everwood&quot;″s reckless messages about sex without consequences are expressly targeted to impressionable teens.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewed positively the show&#x27;s third season in 2005 giving it an A− and commented, &quot;&quot;Everwood&quot;″s soap tropes—unexpected pregnancy, adultery—handles these stories artfully.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;Everwood&quot; one of &quot;The Best Shows You May Not Be Watching&quot;.

<text>The MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards is a film and television awards show presented annually on MTV. It began as the MTV Movie Awards in 1992, when its first edition was held, and adopted its current name in 2017, beginning with its 26th edition.

The awards ceremony has traditionally been tied to the start of the summer blockbuster season for the film industry, and since the launch of the television awards, the opening of that industry&#x27;s awards season. The nominees are decided by producers and executives at MTV. The winners are then decided by the general public. Presently, voting is done only through an official MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards voting website. Winners are presented with the &quot;Golden Popcorn&quot; statue made by New-York-firm Society Awards.
==Production process==
For much of its history, the ceremony was recorded for later broadcast, unlike the MTV Video Music Awards, which are usually live, but not live-to-tape, where the ceremony occurred in chronological order with appropriate edits. This meant that the ceremony was recorded out of order with the host segments recorded all at the start, followed by the musical performances and then award presentations, where those artists and actors nominated could choose to stay only for their award category and then depart after, with a seat filler filling their seat before or afterwards. After 2006, when &quot;Survivor&quot; producer Mark Burnett (who took over duties from Joel Gallen for the 2007 awards) took over production duties, it began to be broadcast live most years, though since 2017, it has been recorded live-to-tape, with a one or two-day delay before airing.

Since 2007, polls for several awards have been voted on through MTV&#x27;s web and social media presences.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 awards were cancelled. Internally, the network had discussed a permanent move of the ceremony to December, which would place it in the early portion of awards season before the Golden Globe Awards. Instead, MTV aired a Vanessa Hudgens-hosted clip show, &quot;MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards: Greatest of All Time&quot;, on December 6, 2020, which featured highlights from past ceremonies and highlighted notable moments from film and television since the 1980s.

The network stated that it aimed to hold a larger, weekend-long ceremony in 2021. On March 11, 2021, MTV announced that the 2021 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards would be held on May 16 and 17, 2021, with the first night focusing on films and scripted television, and a new, second night (M&quot;TV Movie &amp; TV Awards: Unscripted&quot;) focusing exclusively on awards in reality television. The 2022 ceremony maintained the split format, but with both segments airing back-to-back on a single night. The 2023 ceremony was originally to be hosted by Drew Barrymore, but Barrymore and other planned guests dropped out in solidarity with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. As a result, the in-person ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a pre-recorded virtual ceremony with no host. In May 2024, MTV cancelled the 2024 edition, stating that the event was being retooled for 2025.

==Film parodies==
Since 1993, scenes are spoofed, mostly from that year&#x27;s most popular films, although television shows and older movies have also been chosen. This may include sound and video montages, replacing some of the original cast with other actors (commonly, the hosts of each year&#x27;s show) generally mocking the scenes of that film. The diversity of the spoofs can vary greatly, from one dialogue (such as in 2005) to several long scenes, including fighting and action sequences (2003).

<text>Sir James Spearman Winter, (1 January 1845 – 6 October 1911) was a Newfoundland politician and Premier.

==Life==
Winter served in the Conservative government of Sir William Whiteway as Solicitor-General from 1882 to 1885 when he resigned along with a number of other Protestants as a result of sectarian riots at Harbour Grace. Winter was grand master of the Orange Order and intended to launch a new Protestant party but was sidelined when Sir Robert Thorburn formed the &quot;Reform Party&quot; on a &quot;Protestant Rights&quot; agenda. Winter served as Attorney General under Thorburn from 1885 to 1889 when the government was defeated and Winter lost his seat. Winter was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1893 but resigned to lead the Tory Party (which had emerged from the former &quot;Reform Party&quot;). Winter and his party won the 1897 election.

The Winter government faced criticism over the granting of railway contracts and was accused by the Liberal opposition of selling out Newfoundland&#x27;s interest to the Reid family as the minister of finance in Winter&#x27;s government was also on Reid&#x27;s payroll as his legal council while the contract was being negotiated. The scandal was a factor in the defeat of Winter&#x27;s government in 1900.

As a jurist, Winter represented Newfoundland at the 1887-1888 fisheries conference in Washington and was senior counsel for the British government when Newfoundland was before the arbitration tribunal at the Hague in 1910 over a fisheries dispute.

The town of Winterton was named after him.

His sons James and Harry both went on to serve as speakers for the Newfoundland assembly.

<doc id="538717" wikidata="Q4135339" url="?curid=538717" title="General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America">
<text>The General Convention is the primary governing and legislative body of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. With the exception of the Bible, the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, and the Constitution and Canons, it is the ultimate authority in the Episcopal Church, being the bureaucratic facility through which the collegial function of the episcopate is exercised. General Convention comprises two houses: the House of Deputies and the House of Bishops. It meets regularly once every three years; however, the House of Bishops meets regularly in between sessions of General Convention. The Bishops have the right to call special meetings of General Convention.

All diocesan, coadjutor, suffragan, and assistant bishops of the Episcopal Church, whether active or retired, have seat and vote in the House of Bishops. Each diocese of the Episcopal Church, as well as the Navajoland Area Mission and the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe, is entitled to representation in the House of Deputies by four clergy deputies, either presbyters or deacons, canonically resident in the diocese, and four lay deputies who are confirmed communicants in good standing. The Episcopal Church of Liberia is entitled to representation in the House of Deputies by two clergy deputies and two lay deputies, all with seat and voice but no vote. The Official Youth Presence is a group of eighteen high school youth, two from each province. They also have seat and voice but no vote. Resolutions must pass both houses in order to take effect.

The convention is divided into committees which consider resolutions. Resolutions arise from four different sources: 
# &quot;A&quot; resolutions from interim bodies whose work is collected in what is referred to as the &quot;Blue Book&quot; 
# &quot;B&quot; resolutions which come from Bishops 
# &quot;C&quot; resolutions which come from diocesan conventions and 
# &quot;D&quot; resolutions which originate from Deputies.

Each properly submitted resolution is referred to a convention committee which makes its recommendation to the House. When one house has acted on the resolution it is sent to the other house for consideration.

==Officers==

===Presiding Bishop===
The presiding officer of the House of Bishops is the Presiding Bishop. Both houses take part in the selection of a new Presiding Bishop. The members of the Joint Nominating Committee for the Election of the Presiding Bishop are elected from both houses. The House of Deputies elects one clerical and one lay delegate from each province, and the House of Bishops elects one bishop from every province to sit on the joint committee. When a new Presiding Bishop is to be elected, the houses meet together in a joint session, and the nominating committee nominates at least three bishops. During the joint session, any deputy or bishop can nominate additional candidates. The House of Bishops elects the Presiding Bishop from among all nominees. The results of the election are reported to the House of Deputies, which then votes to confirm or not to confirm the election.

===Other officers===
The presiding officers of the House of Deputies are the president and vice president.

A treasurer is elected by the two houses at every regular meeting of General Convention. The treasurer formulates the budget of the Episcopal Church, receives and disburses all money collected under the authority of the convention, and with the approval of the Presiding Bishop invests surplus funds. If the office of treasurer becomes vacant, the Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies appoints a treasurer until a new election is held. The treasurer of the General Convention and the Executive Council is Kurt Barnes.

At each regular meeting of General Convention, the secretary of the House of Deputies is by concurrent action of both houses made the secretary of the General Convention. The secretary oversees the publishing of the Journal of the General Convention. In addition, the secretary also notifies the bishops and secretaries of every diocese to actions of General Convention, especially alterations to the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and the constitution of the Episcopal Church. If the offices of president and vice president become vacant during the triennium, the secretary performs the duties of president until the next meeting of General Convention. The Secretary is also the corporate secretary of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, the corporate body of the Episcopal Church, and one of the four senior officers of the church. The Rev. Canon Michael Barlowe is the Secretary of the House of Deputies, having been appointed upon the retirement of his predecessor, the Rev. Gregory Straub in 2013.

Barlowe is also the Executive Officer of the General Convention, a position filled by joint appointment of the Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies. The Executive Officer &quot;oversees all aspects of the work of Church governance, from site selection through supervision and funding of the work mandated by the convention&quot;. He supervises the secretary, treasurer, and manager of the General Convention and heads the executive office of the General Convention which coordinates the work of the committees, commissions, boards, and agencies (CCAB&#x27;s).

==Interim bodies and standing commissions==
Interim bodies, meeting in between sessions of General Convention, include the Executive Council, various standing commissions, and task forces constituted by the Convention which study and draft policy proposals for consideration and report back to General Convention. Task forces may vary in their size, membership, and duration depending on the General Convention resolution that orders their formation. The Executive Council, composed of the officers of General Convention and members elected by the General Convention and provinces of the Church, oversees the execution of the programs and policies adopted by General Convention. Each standing commission consists of five bishops, five priests or deacons, and ten laypersons. Priests, deacons, and lay persons are not required to be deputies. Bishops are appointed by the Presiding Bishop while the other clergy and laypersons are appointed by the president of the House of Deputies. Members are appointed to rotating terms so that the term for half of the members expires at the conclusion of each regular meeting of the General Convention. The standing commissions are:
*Liturgy and Music
*Structure, Governance, Constitution and Canons
*World Mission

The Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies are ex officio members of all commissions and can appoint personal representatives to attend commission meetings without the right to vote. They jointly appoint Executive Council members as persons to provide communication between the council and each commission. These liaison persons are not commission members and cannot vote; though, they do have voice. The Presiding Bishop also appoints a staff member to assist each commission in its work.

Either house may refer matters to a commission, but one house cannot instruct a commission to take any action without the consent of the other house.

== History==
The American Revolution was very disruptive to the Episcopal churches in the United States. There had been no Anglican dioceses or bishops in the Thirteen Colonies before the Revolution, thus when the American congregations were separated from the Church of England, &quot;the chain which held them together [was] broken&quot;. In 1782, William White, the father of the Episcopal Church, wrote in his pamphlet &quot;The Case of the Episcopal Churches in the United States Considered&quot;, &quot;it would seem, that their future continuance can be provided for only by voluntary associations for union and good government&quot;. In America, the central unit of the church would be the congregation, rather than the diocese. White, a disciple of John Locke, believed that the church, like the state, should be a democracy. He proposed that congregations in each state should unite to form an annual convention (as opposed to a &quot;convocation&quot; or &quot;synod&quot;, terms which denote a body called together by a bishop) of clergy and lay representatives of the congregations. In White&#x27;s plan, the state conventions would send representatives to three provincial conventions which would elect representatives to the General Convention every three years.

The constitution written in 1789 was very similar to White&#x27;s plan, except that state conventions would elect representatives directly to the General Convention. Bishops would be democratically elected and responsible to the General Convention and their respective state (later diocesan) conventions. Bishops would be &quot;servants of the Church and not its lords&quot;. It is often said that the Constitutions of the United States and the Episcopal Church were written by the same people. While this is not true, both were written around the same time in Philadelphia by people who knew each other and who sought to &quot;replace hierarchical rule with egalitarian, democratic government&quot;.

The House of Deputies is the older of the two houses having been formed in 1785. William White was the first President of the House of Deputies. The House of Bishops was formed in 1789 to win the support of those who wanted a greater role for bishops. The House of Deputies had the advantage because with an 80 percent majority it could override a veto of the House of Bishops until 1808 when both houses were given absolute vetoes. White became the first Bishop of Pennsylvania and the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church.

== Notable Conventions ==
* 1785 Philadelphia—Initial General Convention of the Episcopal Church.
* 1817 New York City—Passed legislation founding General Theological Seminary.
* 1865 Philadelphia—After the close of the Civil War, bishops from two Confederate dioceses are warmly welcomed to General Convention, paving the way for the remaining Southern dioceses to rejoin the church soon afterward.

<doc id="538722" wikidata="Q891873" url="?curid=538722" title="Wall Street bombing">
<text>The Wall Street bombing was an act of terrorism on Wall Street at 12:01 pm on Thursday, September 16, 1920. The blast killed 30 people immediately, and another 10 later died of wounds that they sustained in the blast. There were 143 seriously injured, and the total number of injured was in the hundreds.

The bombing was never solved, although investigators and historians believe it was carried out by Galleanists, a group responsible for a series of bombings the previous year.

==Attack==
At noon, a horse-drawn wagon passed by lunchtime crowds on Wall Street and stopped across the street from the headquarters of the J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. bank at 23 Wall Street, on the Financial District&#x27;s busiest corner. Inside the wagon, of dynamite with of heavy, cast-iron sash weights exploded in a timer-set detonation, sending the weights tearing through the air. The horse and wagon were blasted into small fragments, but the driver was seen by witnesses leaving the vehicle and escaping down a side street.

The 40 fatalities were mostly young people who worked as messengers, stenographers, clerks, and brokers. Many of the wounded suffered severe injuries. The bomb caused more than US$2 million ($ million today) in property damage and destroyed most of the interior spaces of the Morgan building.

Within one minute of the explosion, William H. Remick, president of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), suspended trading in order to prevent a panic. Outside, rescuers worked feverishly to transport the wounded to the hospital. James Saul, a 17-year-old messenger, commandeered a parked car and transported 30 injured people to an area hospital. Police officers rushed to the scene, performed first aid, and appropriated all nearby automobiles as emergency transport vehicles.

==Reaction==
The Justice Department&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation (BOI, the forerunner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI) did not immediately conclude that the bomb was an act of terrorism. Investigators were puzzled by the number of innocent people killed and the lack of a specific target, other than buildings that suffered relatively superficial, non-structural damage. Exploring the possibility of an accident, police contacted businesses that sold and transported explosives. By 3:30 pm, the board of governors of the NYSE had met and decided to open for business the next day. Crews cleaned up the area overnight to allow for normal business operations, but in doing so they destroyed physical evidence that might have helped police investigators solve the crime. The Sons of the American Revolution had previously scheduled a patriotic rally for the day after (September 17) to celebrate Constitution Day at exactly the same intersection. On September 17, thousands of people attended the rally in defiance of the previous day&#x27;s attack.

The New York assistant district attorney noted that the timing, location, and method of delivery all pointed to Wall Street and J.P. Morgan as the targets of the bomb, suggesting in turn that it was planted by radical opponents of capitalism, such as Bolsheviks, anarchists, communists, or militant socialists. Investigators soon focused on radical groups opposed to U.S. financial and governmental institutions and known to use bombs as a means of violent reprisal. Often throughout the Gilded Age, radical ideology and violence was used as a form of protest by groups to initiate change. When simple protests were not enough, these extremists would resort to ruthless measures to be heard. Although the violence proved to be detrimental to their overall cause, many historians saw that this was a clear point of radical behavior aimed at facilitating transformation throughout the classes. They observed that the Wall Street bomb was packed with heavy sash weights designed to act as shrapnel, then detonated on the street in order to increase casualties among financial workers and institutions during the busy lunch hour.

Officials eventually blamed anarchists and communists for the Wall Street bombing. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the attack an &quot;act of war&quot;. The bombing stimulated renewed efforts by police and federal investigators to track the activities and movements of foreign radicals. Public demands to track down the perpetrators led to an expanded role for the BOI, including the bureau&#x27;s General Intelligence Division headed by J. Edgar Hoover. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) also pushed to form a &quot;special, or secret, police&quot; to monitor &quot;radical elements&quot; in the city.

On September 17, the BOI released the contents of flyers found in a post office box in the Wall Street area just before the explosion. Printed in red ink on white paper, they said: &quot;Remember, we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners, or it will be sure death for all of you.&quot; At the bottom was: &quot;American Anarchist Fighters&quot;. The BOI quickly decided that the flyer eliminated the possibility of an accidental explosion. William J. Flynn, director of the BOI, suggested the flyers were similar to those found at the June 1919 anarchist bombings.

==Investigations==
The BOI investigation stalled when none of the victims turned out to be the driver of the wagon. Though the horse was newly shod, investigators could not locate the stable responsible for the work. When the blacksmith was located in October, he could offer the police little information. Investigators questioned tennis champion Edwin Fischer, who had sent warning postcards to friends, telling them to leave the area before September 16. He told police he had received the information &quot;through the air&quot;. They found Fischer made a regular habit of issuing such warnings, and had him committed to Amityville Asylum, where he was diagnosed as insane but harmless.

The BOI and local police investigated the case for over three years without success. Occasional arrests garnered headlines but each time they failed to support indictments. Most of the initial investigation focused on anarchists and communists, such as the Galleanist group, whom authorities believed were involved in the 1919 bombings. During President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s administration, officials evaluated the Soviet Union and the Communist Party USA as possible masterminds of the bombing. In 1944, the FBI, successor to the BOI, investigated again. It concluded that its agents had explored many radical groups, &quot;such as the Union of Russian Workers, the I.W.W., Communist, etc. ... and from the result of the investigations to date it would appear that none of the aforementioned organizations had any hand in the matter and that the explosion was the work of either Italian anarchists or Italian terrorists.&quot;

One Galleanist in particular, Italian anarchist Mario Buda (1884–1963), an associate of Sacco and Vanzetti and the owner of a car which led to the arrest of the latter for a separate robbery and murder, is alleged by some historians, including Paul Avrich, to be the man most likely to have planted the bomb. Avrich and other historians theorize that Buda acted in revenge for the arrest and indictment of Sacco and Vanzetti. Buda&#x27;s involvement as the Wall Street bombmaker was confirmed by statements made by his nephew Frank Maffi and fellow anarchist Charles Poggi, who interviewed Buda in Savignano sul Rubicone, Italy, in 1955. Buda (at that time known by the alias of Mike Boda) had eluded authorities at the time of the Sacco and Vanzetti arrests, was experienced in the use of dynamite and other explosives, was known to use sash weights as shrapnel in his time bombs, and is believed to have constructed several of the largest package bombs for the Galleanists. These included the Milwaukee Police Department bombing, which was a large black powder bomb that killed nine policemen in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. However, he was neither arrested nor questioned by police.

After leaving New York, Buda resumed the use of his real name in order to secure a passport from the Italian vice-consul, then promptly sailed for Naples. By November, he was back in his native Italy, never to return to the United States. Galleanists still in the U.S. continued the bombing and assassination campaign for another 12 years, culminating in a 1932 bomb attack targeting Webster Thayer, the presiding judge in the Sacco and Vanzetti trial. Thayer, who survived the ensuing blast that destroyed his house and injured his wife and housekeeper, moved his residence to his club for the last year and a half of his life, where he was guarded 24 hours a day.

==In media==
The bombing has inspired several books, notably &quot;The Day Wall Street Exploded&quot; by Beverly Gage, &quot;The Death Instinct&quot; by Jed Rubenfeld. 

Upton Sinclair writes about this event in the book &quot;Oil!&quot; He argues that there was no conspiracy, rather the bombing was negligence from a truck driver carrying hazardous material who ignored the rules for their safe transport.

The bombing is the subject of the PBS series &quot;American Experience&quot; episode &quot;The Bombing of Wall Street&quot;, broadcast in February 2018.

Additionally, the bombing is depicted in the 2012 period thriller film &quot;No God, No Master&quot;.

Susan Kay Bogguss was born on December 30, 1956, in Aledo, Illinois, United States, the youngest of four born to Barbara &quot;B.J.&quot; (née Stewart) and Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Bogguss. Charles was an Army officer who served in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II, and later became a machinist who worked at an International Harvester plant at East Moline. B.J. was a secretary-auditor for a Midwest grocery chain. Her grandmothers played piano at theaters. At age 5, she began singing in the Angel Choir of the College Avenue Presbyterian Church in her hometown. With her parents&#x27; encouragement, she took lessons in piano and drums, and as a teenager picked up the guitar as well. In her youth, Bogguss would visit Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at their home in Apple Valley, California, as they attended the same church as her grandparents. She starred in several musicals at Aledo High School, where she was crowned homecoming queen. After graduating in 1975, she enrolled at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, but later transferred to Illinois State University (ISU) in Normal. She graduated from ISU in 1980 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in metalsmithing. She would later use these skills to design her own jewelry.

Bogguss later recalled of her interest in music, &quot;Being from a small town I didn’t realize that somebody had to make this stuff. I was so green. I also knew about Elton John and other big performers, but it never occurred to me that somebody like me from my small town could make a living making music.&quot; Having sung and played guitar and drums in local coffeehouses during her college years, Bogguss embarked on a nationwide tour as a folk troubadour after graduating from ISU. At the time, she was drawn to other singers such as Emmylou Harris, James Taylor and Bonnie Raitt. During this time, she produced her first independent album for Old Shack Recording: &quot;Suzy&quot;. The LP was available for purchase at her shows and is now a rare collector&#x27;s item. In 1984, while touring at the Huntley Lodge resort in Montana, Bogguss discovered that she spent most of her money on clothes for her later shows. She also realized that she had no health insurance, very little car insurance, and low chances of performing further, and there were no talent scouts.

After moving to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1985, Bogguss began working at the local Tony Roma&#x27;s restaurant on her first day there. While there, she performed a three-day audition for entertainer Dolly Parton at Silver Dollar City, a theme park which would eventually become Dollywood. The following year, she became the first featured female performer at the park, playing four solo shows at the park&#x27;s train station and appearing in the &quot;Jamboree&quot; show. On performing at the train station, Bogguss later recalled that &quot;I kept thinking, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to get black lung disease [from the coal train in Dollywood].&#x27;&quot; Bogguss said that performing at the park &quot;was the first situation where I knew that every time I introduced a song by a country artist, they knew who the artist&#x27;s mom was, who his or her brothers and sisters were and who he or she was married to.&quot; These performances prompted her to make a self-produced demo recording at a studio owned by folk singer Wendy Waldman, who would eventually become Bogguss&#x27;s first producer. Bogguss made several copies and sold them while performing in Dollywood. At the time, she recorded a demo of &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot;, a song written by Doug Crider that would become part of her debut studio album. Crider and Bogguss met each other, and eventually married in November 1986. The demo soon caught the attention of Capitol Records president Jim Foglesong, who offered her a recording contract on the Liberty/Capitol Nashville label.

==Liberty/Capitol recording career==
In 1987, Bogguss released her first three singles for Capitol, a cover of The Ink Spots&#x27; 1941 song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire,&quot; &quot;Love Will Never Slip Away,&quot; and &quot;Come as You Were&quot;. Two of these singles succeeded in making the lower reaches of the Billboard country music charts. Her debut studio album for Capitol, &quot;Somewhere Between&quot; was released in March 1989. &quot;Somewhere Between&quot;, with its blend of traditional and contemporary styles, drew positive reviews from critics. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Cross My Broken Heart,&quot; became a top-20 hit on the country music charts. The same year, Bogguss won the award for Top New Female Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music.

For her second album, &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, production tasks were taken over by new label-head and Nashville producer Jimmy Bowen, who moved Bogguss&#x27;s sound in a more polished direction. However, the album&#x27;s two singles failed to rise beyond the lower reaches of the Billboard charts. A duet she recorded with Lee Greenwood, &quot;Hopelessly Yours,&quot; went to No. 12 on the country singles chart and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.

In 1991 Bogguss released her third studio album, the platinum-selling &quot;Aces&quot;. The LP yielded four hit singles - &quot;Someday Soon&quot;, &quot;Outbound Plane&quot;, &quot;Aces&quot;, and &quot;Letting Go&quot;, the latter three reaching the country Top Ten. At the 1992 Country Music Association Awards Bogguss won the Horizon Award. In September of that year, Bogguss began designing women&#x27;s leather apparel; the apparel was sold in stores on the West Coast.

Her 1992 follow-up, &quot;Voices in the Wind&quot;, earned Bogguss her second straight gold record. The album&#x27;s first single, a cover of the 1988 song &quot;Drive South&quot; by John Hiatt, missed the No. 1 spot but gave Bogguss the highest-charting hit of her career to date. Her streak continued the following year with another gold record, &quot;Something Up My Sleeve&quot;, giving her two additional Top Five hits in &quot;Just Like the Weather&quot; and &quot;Hey Cinderella&quot;. The latter, which she cowrote with Matraca Berg and Gary Harrison, has gone on to become one of Bogguss&#x27;s signature songs. In May 1993, Bogguss appeared on the CBS television special &quot;The Women of Country&quot;.

Eventually, Bogguss became the sole producer of her sixth studio album, &quot;Simpatico&quot;. The album consisted of duets with long-time friend and guitarist Chet Atkins. The album was released in 1994, and though it was generally well reviewed, its only single, &quot;One More for the Road,&quot; did not chart. That same year, Bogguss&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was released and went gold. Later, Bogguss collaborated with Alison Krauss, Kathy Mattea, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash to contribute &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; to the AIDS benefit compilation album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Upon completing &quot;Simpatico&quot;, Bogguss temporarily set her music aside to start a family. Bogguss and Crider&#x27;s first child, Benton Charles Crider, was born on March 17, 1995. She also scaled down her touring dates as a result for three years. In May of that year, Bogguss performed at the White House with Kathy Mattea and Alison Krauss. This event later aired on PBS stations in September as &quot;Women of Country Music&quot;. In July 1996, she released her seventh studio album, entitled &quot;Give Me Some Wheels&quot;. During her break, the climate of country music had changed considerably, with more pop-oriented female singers such as Martina McBride, Faith Hill, and Shania Twain dominating the charts. Bogguss&#x27;s traditional, straightforward style failed to connect with younger listeners, and the record yielded low sales. In March 1997, Bogguss performed at the Every Woman&#x27;s Challenge charity concert, which was held at the Palm Springs Convention Center in California.

After her next album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt&quot;, also proved unsuccessful, Bogguss was dropped from Capitol. On February 18, 1999, Bogguss issued the following statement:

==Indie label recording career==

Following her departure from Capitol, Bogguss signed with Nashville-based fledgling label Platinum Records, headed by former Capitol executive George Collier. Within three months, she had released her self-titled ninth studio album, &quot;Suzy Bogguss&quot;. Once again, the album was commercially unsuccessful, with her only single &quot;Goodnight&quot; making an appearance on the country charts.

In 2001, Bogguss founded her own record label, Loyal Dutchess. The label&#x27;s first album, &quot;Live at Caffé Milano&quot;, documents three separate 1999 performances at the Caffé Milano in Nashville. This release is only available for purchase at Bogguss&#x27;s official website. In November 2001, she released the holiday album, &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, a compilation of new and previously available material included through a special licensing agreement with Capitol. In addition to being available at her website, the album was also offered through Amazon.com, select retailers, and at her live performances.

In March 2003, Bogguss and Loyal Dutchess Records signed a deal with Compadre Records. Her first release on this label was the Western swing album, &quot;Swing&quot;, that she had been recording with producer Ray Benson, the bandleader of Western swing group Asleep at the Wheel. Although the album saw only lukewarm sales (it reached No. 6 on the jazz album charts, but failed to appear on the Billboard 200), it was well received by critics. Bogguss&#x27; next album, &quot;Sweet Danger&quot;, was released in 2007. The album peaked at No. 4 on the jazz charts. In July 2011, Bogguss released her twelfth studio album, &quot;American Folk Songbook&quot;. The album consisted of renditions of several American folk songs, such as &quot;Red River Valley&quot;. In addition to the CD, Bogguss and husband Doug Crider also produced a companion hard cover song book that included lyrics, sheet music, and a short history of each song. A paperback version of the songbook became available in 2015.

In February 2014 Bogguss released &quot;Lucky&quot; a collection of songs written by Merle Haggard. To partially fund the promotion of the album she created a very successful Kickstarter crowd funding campaign which raised over $75,000 with the participation of nearly 1000 contributors. The album was promoted through the Americana format and was well received.

During the summer of 2016, Bogguss conducted a celebration via her Suzy Bogguss Music Facebook page, of the 25th anniversary of the release of her Platinum selling Aces Album in 1991. Aces also was her break out album which brought her serious attention on Country Radio and secured her future on Capitol Nashville for several more albums. On August 18, 2016, the actual 25th anniversary of the release of the original Aces album, she released a new re-imagined and rerecorded version of the album entitled &quot;Aces Redux&quot;. A release party and concert was held that night at the &quot;3rd and Lindsley&quot; venue in Nashville. &quot;Aces Redux&quot; was recorded with the help of a number of the musicians that have toured with Bogguss over the years and included background vocals by friends Beth Nielsen Chapman and Kim Carnes along with several others. The album takes a more acoustic and simpler production tack than the original which also reflects her more recent touring approach as a trio with Charlie Chadwick on standup Bass and Craig Smith on lead guitar.

Bogguss&#x27;s 17th studio album, &quot;Prayin&#x27; for Sunshine&quot;, was released on November 3, 2023. It marks the first time she is credited as a writer of all songs on one of her albums. MusicRow said the album &quot;captures the unvarnished essence of southern storytelling and the authentic roots of Americana music.&quot; In a review for the lead single, &quot;It All Falls Down to the River&quot;, American Songwriter called the song &quot;a lyrical gut-punch, shining a light on hard truths about life in the United States. From the site of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination to the levees of New Orleans that broke during Hurricane Katrina, Bogguss and The McCrary Sisters paint a powerful picture of our nation’s complex past and present.&quot; In an album review, No Depression said the album &quot;showcases Bogguss’ lyrical and musical ingenuity, her nod-and-a-wink humor, and her deep love for her community of friends and fans. And the album reminds us again just how radiant and transportive Bogguss’ vocals are.&quot;

<doc id="538731" wikidata="Q36385" url="?curid=538731" title="Moabite language">
<text>The Moabite language, also known as the Moabite dialect, is an extinct sub-language or dialect of the Canaanite languages, themselves a branch of Northwest Semitic languages, formerly spoken in the region described in the Bible as Moab (modern day central-western Jordan) in the early 1st millennium BC. 

The body of Canaanite epigraphy found in the region is described as Moabite; this is a very small corpus limited primarily to the Mesha Stele and a few seals.

Moabite, together with the similarly poorly-attested Ammonite and Edomite, belonged to the dialect continuum of the Canaanite group of northwest Semitic languages, together with Hebrew and Phoenician.

==History==
An altar inscription written in Moabite and dated to 800 BC was revealed in an excavation in Khirbat Ataruz. It was written using a variant of the Phoenician alphabet. Most knowledge about Moabite comes from the Mesha Stele, which is the only known extensive text in the language. In addition, there is the three-line El-Kerak Inscription and a few seals. The inscription on Mesha Stele is also referred to as “Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften” (KAI), which is German for “Canaanite and Aramaic Inscriptions.” It is to be read from right to left.

The following table presents the first four lines of the inscription of Mesha Stele including its transliteration and English translation by Alviero Niccacci.
== Grammar ==
The main features distinguishing Moabite from fellow Canaanite languages such as Hebrew and Phoenician are: a plural in &quot;-în&quot; rather than &quot;-îm&quot; (e.g. &quot;mlkn&quot; &quot;kings&quot; for Biblical Hebrew &quot;məlākîm&quot;), like Aramaic (also Northwest Semitic) and Arabic (Central Semitic); retention of the feminine ending &quot;-at&quot; or &quot;-ah&quot;, which Biblical Hebrew reduces to &quot;-āh&quot; only (e.g. &quot;qiryat&quot; or &quot;qiryah&quot;, &quot;town&quot;, Biblical Hebrew &quot;qiryāh&quot;) but retains in the construct state nominal form (e.g. &quot;qiryát yisrael&quot; &quot;town of Israel&quot;); and retention of a verb form with infixed &quot;-t-&quot;, also found in Arabic and Akkadian (&quot;w-’ltḥm&quot; &quot;I began to fight&quot;, from the root &quot;lḥm&quot;). Vowel values and diphthongs, which had potential to vary wildly between Semitic languages, were also largely typical of other Semitic tongues: there is inconsistent evidence to suggest that &quot;ā&quot; shifted to &quot;ō&quot; much like in Hebrew and later Phoenician, at the same time, there is evidence to suggest that the diphthongs /aw/ and /ay/ eventually contracted to &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;ē&quot;, another characteristic shared by Hebrew and later Phoenician. Moabite differed only dialectally from Hebrew, and Moabite religion and culture was related to that of the Israelites. On the other hand, although Moabite itself had begun to diverge, the script used in the 9th century BC did not differ from the script used in Hebrew inscriptions at that time.

=== Arrows ===
In numbered examples, non-Roman script representations are signaled by arrows, namely ⟶ or ⟵, to indicate the text&#x27;s direction of writing as it is presented in the volume. As for Ugaritic, Hebrew (epigraphic and Tiberian), Phoenician, and Moabite, the arrow will typically point in the same direction as the original writing.

=== Numerals ===
The absolute numeral precedes singular (collective) nouns, for instance “thirty years” is expressed as “šlšn.št” in line 2 of KAI; it has been transliterated as well as translated by Alvierra Niccani. Others are followed by a plural noun. Numeral phrases can stand in apposition with a noun (phrase) coming before or after. This is seen in KAI&#x27;s line 17: “ymh.wḥṣy.ymy.bnh.’rb’nšt,” meaning, “his days and half the days of his son, for forty years.”

== Controversy ==

=== Sentence boundaries ===
In the inscriptions on the Mesha Stele a vertical stroke, /, appears 37 times. However, its function is the subject of disagreement among researchers. Van Zyl claims that the strokes are used to divide clauses. Similarly, Segert explains that they can be seen as tools for the punctuation of sentences. A. Poebel offers a different explanation and states that vertical strokes are used to separate sentences forming a mentally cohesive group. According to Andersen the only two parallels that can be found in accordance with the stroke are in the Gezer Calendar. Rather, he suggest that a dot fulfills the function as a word divider based on its occurrence in a variety of Old Aramaic inscriptions, the Siloam Inscription and other texts of the early Hebrew.

=== Classification as Canaanite dialects ===
The geography of the dialects of the Levant has been revised the past few years. Dialects of Canaanite, including Moabite, show differences from one another.

==== Isogloss ====
A lexical isogloss exists between the Northwest Semitic languages Aramaic, Hebrew and Moabite. For example, the verb &#x27;to be&#x27;, from the root(s) *HWY/HYY. The coastal languages, Phoenician and Ugaritic, both used the root *KWN, and that seems to be the case in the mother tongue of the Amarna scribes from Canaan as well; and it is also standard in Arabic.

==== Syntactic features ====
A syntactic feature that Aramaic, Hebrew and Moabite share is the syntagma of the narrative preterit. Supported by three inscriptions, prefix preterite narrative sequences are found in Moabite as well as Old Southern Aramaic and Hebrew. First, it was discerned in the Old Aramaic inscription of Zakkur by king of Hamath and proclaimed to be of Canaanite influence on an Aramaic text. Second, it occurred in the Deir Alla Inscription. Finally the prefix preterite, appeared in the Tel Dan stele with and without the sequential conjunction. This feature is absent in Phoenician, a language that is certain to be Canaanite, which suggests that the classification of Moabite as a Canaanite dialect does not apply.

<doc id="538735" wikidata="Q5523621" url="?curid=538735" title="Garner State Park">
<text>Garner State Park is a state park in the community of Concan, Texas located in Uvalde County, Texas in the United States. Garner State Park, in the Texas Hill Country, is the most popular state park in Texas for overnight camping. It often fills by noon in peak parts of the season. The park is popular with campers and local residents for its activities on the Frio River and the dances held nightly during the spring and summer.

==History==

In the early 1930s the park was built to save a portion of the hill country for the public, and to provide work for unemployed men during the economic depression. The land for Garner State Park was acquired in 1934 through 1936. In 1934, the Texas State Parks Board approved the location for a future state park, and the Texas Legislature provided funding for state parks. The Civilian Conservation Corps built the park’s original improvements, which included a large pavilion and a concessions building. The property was conveyed to the State Parks Board in 1936, and it opened as Garner State Park in 1941. The park was named for John Nance Garner, former Vice-President of the United States who lived and practiced law in the Concan area. The park&#x27;s size more than doubled when were added in 1976.

Another park named Garner State Park, later known as Stephenville State Park, began construction in 1932 in Erath County, Texas, though the name was soon transferred to the Uvalde location. The city of Stephenville, which operated the park, returned the land to the state in the 1940s. The property was returned to the local Collier family in 1953 and, after being sold in 1982, is now known as Garner Park Ranch.

==Geology==

The area came about in the Cretaceous age when the Edwards Plateau was formed when a section of land was lifted 2000 feet along a curving fault. It is now located on the southwestern edge of the plateau in the sub-region Balcones Canyonlands. Today high mesas, limestone cliffs, deep canyons and clear streams fill the terrain.

===Mount Old Baldy===

Garner State Park is home to Mount Old Baldy, which overlooks the Frio River. At its peak, the mountain sits at 1,849 feet above sea level.

==Nature==
===Flora===
The area has rich vegetation due to the canyons angles from southeast to southwest as well as prevailing winds which cool and moisten the area.

====Bald cypress====
The bald cypress trees line the Frio River, can grow to 120 feet, and live up to 600 years. Their name is derived from the length of time that they are leafless, since they shed leaves in the fall and don’t bloom until late spring. The bald cypress help the Frio River by slowing floodwaters, trapping sediment and pollutants. They also provide nesting sites, food and shelter for wildlife.

====&quot;Arbutus xalapensis&quot;====
The &quot;Arbutus xalapensis&quot;, also known as the Texas madrone, is a rare tree that grows to about 20 to 30 feet. The trunk has red inner bark and peels in thin sheets of orange and brown. White bell-shaped flowers bloom in spring, and produce red and orange berries.

===Fauna===

There is much wildlife in the park such as white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, wild turkeys, striped skunks and other animals. Two endangered species of bird nest in this park.

====Golden-cheeked warbler==== 
The golden-cheeked warbler are birds that nest only in the mixed Ashe juniper and oak woodlands of Central Texas from March to July. They feed on insects and spiders from trees and use spider webs in building their nests. They are endangered due to loss of nesting habitat.

====Black-capped vireo==== 
The black-capped vireo are small birds that nest in Texas in the spring but from April to July. They make their nests in low shrubs, and are endangered because of the destruction of their habitat by grazing, clearing and fire suppression.

==Housing and facilities==

===Campsites===
Visitors require a reservation made in advance due to the popularity of the park. Visitors may choose between a tent/RV site, a screened shelter or a cabin. Some cabins have fireplaces, all have kitchen facilities and indoor plumbing. If a campsite or screened shelter is chosen, there are public restrooms and showers available to all park guests.

===Garner Grill===
During the day, the Garner Grill adjacent to the big pavilion is open. There is even a new souvenir cup style every season that can be collected. The Grill is open daily during the summer but is closed during the off-season, typically October through February.

===Gift shop===
At the gift shop one can purchase souvenirs like jewelry, boots, toys and other items. Customized apparel featuring the park&#x27;s name is available. There is also an online gift shop, updated regularly, providing merchandise as well.

==Recreation==

Activities at the park include hiking, nature study, picnicking, canoeing, fishing, paddle boat and kayak rentals (spring and summer), bicycling and miniature golf.

===Day Use Visitors===
Garner State Park is the most sought after park in the Texas State Parks system. Due to high demand, a Day Use reservation is highly recommended during the off-season months of October to February. During the high demand on-season months of March to September, Day Use reservations are required before visiting the park to guarantee entry.

===Ranger programs===
To learn more about the park, there are ranger instructional programs. In these programs, park rangers teach students about the nature, history, and traditions of the park and let campers participate in geology programs and can be led on nature hikes.

===Volunteer opportunities===
Volunteers can help by keeping the park clean by maintaining trails, renewing habitats, becoming a park host or leading educational programs.

<doc id="538737" wikidata="Q6837810" url="?curid=538737" title="Michigan Womyn's Music Festival">
<text>The Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival, often referred to as MWMF or Michfest, was a lesbian feminist women&#x27;s music festival held annually from 1976 to 2015 in Oceana County, Michigan, on privately owned woodland near Hart Township referred to as &quot;The Land&quot; by Michfest organizers and attendees. The event was built, staffed, run, and attended exclusively by women, with girls, young boys and toddlers permitted.

From 1991, the festival excluded trans women, adopting a &quot;womyn-born womyn&quot; policy, which drew increasing criticism. The festival was picketed by Camp Trans starting in the 1990s for its exclusionary policy. LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Michigan boycotted the event in 2014. Michfest drew criticism from the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the National LGBTQ Task Force, among others. The festival held its final event in August 2015.

==History==
===Background===
The first women&#x27;s music festivals in the United States were founded in the early 1970s, starting with day festivals at the Sacramento State and San Diego State University campuses, the Midwest Women&#x27;s Festival in Missouri, the Boston Women&#x27;s Music Festival, and the National Women&#x27;s Music Festival at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. These first regional women-only events exposed audiences to feminist and openly lesbian artists, most of whom operated independently of the mainstream recording industry. Festival gatherings offered an alternative to urban bars, coffeehouses and protest marches, which were some of the few opportunities for lesbians to meet one another in the early 1970s. The feminist separatism of the spaces was a direct outgrowth of, and solidarity with, the activism created by black power and other racial solidarity movements.

===1970s===
In 1976, Lisa Vogel, along with sister Kristie Vogel and friend Mary Kindig, founded the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival after attending an indoor festival of women&#x27;s music in Boston the year before. They were joined by local businesswoman Susan Alborell. When their application to form a non-profit collective was denied, the We Want the Music Corporation was structured as the parent company of MWMF. Michfest was initially conceptualized as an event attended by women and feminist men; however, it became a women-only festival when the characteristics of outdoor camping were taken into consideration. MWMF was thereafter established as &quot;an event for lesbians&quot;. Years later, author and feminist scholar Bonnie Morris would describe Michfest as &quot;an entire city run by and for lesbian feminists. Utopia revealed. And Eden—built by Eves.&quot;

===1980s===
In 1982, Michfest moved to what would become its long-term 650-acre location near Hart, Michigan. In subsequent years it would add an acoustic stage and an open mic stage, in addition to day stage and night stage programming. Cement-paved walkways were added to ease access for women with mobility challenges and baby strollers. Barbara &quot;Boo&quot; Price became Vogel&#x27;s business partner after the 1985 festival and was increasingly involved with production until the two parted ways in 1994. A 10th-anniversary double album was produced in 1985, and in 1986, the festival expanded to five days. The festival was hampered by an outbreak of shigella in 1988.

===1990s and 2000s===

In the 1990s, Michfest added a runway to the Night Stage and a mosh pit. Notable artists invited to the event during this era included the Indigo Girls and Tribe 8.

====Exclusion controversy====
In 1991, trans woman Nancy Jean Burkholder was asked to leave the festival. This was retroactively justified by the instatement of a &quot;womyn-born-womyn&quot; policy, as named by Vogel. Vogel stated in 2013 that Michfest was intended for &quot;womyn who at birth were deemed female&quot;. The practical effect was that trans women were excluded from the festival, which became the subject of increasing criticism.

In 1992, Burkholder had a survey circulated at Michfest that asked, &quot;Do you think male-to-female transsexuals should be welcome at Michigan?&quot; Although the sample was not &quot;randomly selected&quot;, the results were interpreted as indicating that the greater number of those who attended MWMF would be against the exclusion of transsexual women, and &quot;strongly suggest[ed] that the majority of Festigoers would support a &#x27;no penis&#x27; policy that would allow postoperative male-to-female transsexuals&quot; to attend Michfest. At the 2000 event, staff gave arrivals a sheet saying that the festival may deny &quot;admission to individuals who self-declare as male-to-female transsexuals or female-to-male transsexuals now living as men (or [ask] them to leave if they enter).&quot;

Critics argued that the womyn-born womyn intention constituted discrimination against transgender people and in 1995, Camp Trans, an annual protest event held concurrently with Michfest that operated adjacent to the festival venue, was launched.

In a 2005 interview with Amy Ray, Vogel defended the intention, stating that &quot;having a space for women, who are born women, to come together for a week, is a healthy, whole, loving space to provide for women who have that experience. To label that as transphobic is, to me, as misplaced as saying the women-of-color tent is racist, or to say that a transsexual-only space, a gathering of folks of women who are born men is misogynist. I have always in my heart believed in the politics and the culture of separate time and space.&quot; In a 2006 press release, Vogel stated that &quot;we strongly assert there is nothing transphobic with choosing to spend one week with womyn who were born as, and have lived their lives as, womyn.&quot;

Trans–bi activist Julia Serano, writing in 2007, criticized Michigan&#x27;s policy as transmisogyny and pointed to a double standard: trans men were allowed at the festival, but trans women were not; in effect, this meant that trans men were treated as if they were women. She accused Michigan&#x27;s policy of being inherently sexist against women and going against the very idea of a women&#x27;s music festival, rebutted various statements put forth by Michfest in support of their policy, and described the preventing of pre-op trans women as phallocentric.

In 2013, transgender activist Red Durkin launched a Change.org petition asking performers to boycott Michfest until the womyn-born womyn intention was abolished. In response, Vogel stated that &quot;I reject the assertion that creating a time and place for WBW to gather is inherently transphobic. This is a false dichotomy and one that prevents progress and understanding.&quot; Shortly after the petition was launched, the Indigo Girls announced that 2013 would be their last year at the festival while the intention was in place, releasing a statement that &quot;we strongly feel that the time is long overdue for a change of intention, to one that states very plainly the inclusion of Trans Womyn.&quot; Another performer, Lovers, expressed their opposition to the intention but chose to perform in 2013 anyway. They released a statement arguing that &quot;MWMF responds not to external, but internal pressure, and we believe that ultimately, the women who attend the festival are the ones who will decide future.&quot;

In 2014, LGBT advocacy group Equality Michigan boycotted Michfest. The boycott was joined by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), GLAAD, the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), and the National LGBTQ Task Force. Michfest accused the boycott of being &quot;based on misrepresentations, purposeful omissions, and selective editing of prior Festival statements on this issue,&quot; with Vogel referring to the boycott as &quot;McCarthy-era blacklist tactics&quot;. The NCLR and National LGBTQ Task Force would later withdraw their support for the boycott, as they felt it would not be &quot;ultimately productive&quot; in realizing its objective stating, &quot;We have not abandoned our efforts to work for a fully inclusive Michfest. Our goal is a Michfest that fully welcomes Trans women.&quot;

Protests against the intention resulted in criticism of artists who had performed or been invited to Michfest. Bitch, of the band Bitch and Animal, attracted criticism for choosing to play at MWMF, resulting in the Boston Dyke March canceling an appearance by her in 2007, and she was also pulled or dis-invited from several other music festivals. Members of The Butchies and Le Tigre claimed to have been &quot;verbally attacked, endlessly harassed and physically threatened&quot; for deciding to play at the festival. In October 2013, filmmaker Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to resign from the board of the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp for attending Michfest.

Michfest also had the stated intention that attendees&#x27; gender should not be challenged, and it was reported that transgender women attended the festival without revealing their status. This approach by the festival was criticized as equivalent to &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; by Emily Dievendorf of Equality Michigan, Riki Wilchins of GenderPAC, and Julia Serano.

===Closure in 2015===
Michfest celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015. On April 21, Lisa Vogel announced via Facebook that it would also be the last festival. Vogel wrote in her statement:
 There have been struggles; there is no doubt about that. This is part of our truth, but it is not — and never has been — our defining story. The Festival has been the crucible for nearly every critical cultural and political issue the lesbian feminist community has grappled with for four decades. Those struggles have been a beautiful part of our collective strength; they have never been a weakness.

==Operations==
===Activities and services===
Attendance at the Michfest ranged from 3,000 to 10,000. Women built the stages, ran the lighting and sound systems, made trash collection rounds, served as electricians, mechanics, security, medical and psychological support, cooked meals for thousands over open fire pits, provided childcare, and facilitated workshops covering various topics of interest to the attendees, who were referred to as &quot;festies&quot;. Up to one month was spent building the festival grounds, and dismantling them at the close of the event.

Management decisions were made through worker community meetings. Community service support included ASL interpretation at performances, mental and physical health care, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, camping for disabled women, as well as a tent solely for women of color.

Writing from a personal perspective for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in fall 1994, musician and Festival kitchen worker Gretchen Phillips (co-founder of the band Two Nice Girls) said: &quot;I had never seen so many breasts before, so many bare asses, so much damn skin on such a vast terrain. I decided to make that weekend all about studying my body issues&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve always used Mich as a place to charge my batteries for the rest of the year, planning my life around being there in August and learning my lessons, both fun and hard.&quot;

Male children age four and under were allowed within the festival. Childcare for girls and boys under five was provided. A summer camp, Brother Sun Boys Camp, was available for boys aged 5 to 10.

===Production and performances===
Artists from multiple genres performed at Michfest, including classical, jazz, folk, hard rock, acoustic, bluegrass and gospel. The Festival created a high-tech production with three stages in a rural outdoor venue. Notable performers included Margie Adam, BETTY, Bitch, Tracy Chapman, Lea DeLaria, Melissa Ferrick, Mary Gauthier, Indigo Girls, Marga Gomez, Valerie June, Holly Near, Carole Pope, Vicki Randle, Jane Siberry, Jill Sobule, Cheryl Wheeler, Dar Williams, Cris Williamson, and Sam Bettens (formerly Sarah Bettens).

===Michfest Half-Way Soirée===
In 2005, festival attendee Lisa A. Snyder created the &quot;Michfest Half-Way Soirée&quot; in New York City to support the local Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival community, female musicians, and women-owned businesses. Half-Way to Michfest Parties (sometimes also called Mid-Way Parties or Michfest Half-Way Parties) were subsequently held in many locations.

==Status of land property==
In 2017, non-profit organization We Want the Land Coalition entered into a contract to purchase the land from Lisa Vogel. WWTLC intends to make the land accessible to women who want to organize events on it. Smaller events were planned for the summer of 2019. Fern Fest, an event resembling Michfest, though trans inclusive, was held in August 2022.

<text>Kenneth Harry Olsen (February 20, 1926 – February 6, 2011) was an American engineer who co-founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1957 with colleague Harlan Anderson and his brother Stan Olsen.

==Background==
Kenneth Harry Olsen was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut and grew up in the neighboring town of Stratford, Connecticut. His father&#x27;s parents came from Norway and his mother&#x27;s parents from Sweden. Olsen began his career working summers in a machine shop. Fixing radios in his basement gave him the reputation of a neighborhood inventor.

After serving in the United States Navy between 1944 and 1946, Olsen attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned both a BS (1950) and an MS (1952) degree in electrical engineering.

==Career==
===Pre-DEC===
During his studies at MIT, the Office of Naval Research of the United States Department of the Navy recruited Olsen to help build a computerized flight simulator. Also while at MIT, he directed the building of the first transistorized research computer, the TX-0. Olsen was an engineer who had been working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the TX-2 project.

Olsen&#x27;s most important connection to Project Whirlwind was his work on the &quot;Memory Test Computer&quot; (MTC), described as &quot;a special purpose computer built to test core memory for the Whirlwind.&quot; Unlike the 18-bit TX-0, which was &quot;designed to be a predecessor for a larger 36 bit machine, the TX-2,&quot; Whirlwind and the MTC used 16 bits.

===Digital Equipment Corporation===
In 1957, Olsen and an MIT colleague, Harlan Anderson, decided to start their own firm. They approached American Research and Development Corporation, an early venture capital firm, which had been founded by Georges Doriot, and founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) after receiving $70,000 for a 70% share. In the 1960s, Olsen received patents for a saturable switch, a diode transformer gate circuit, an improved version of magnetic-core memory, and the line printer buffer. (The MIT professor Jay W. Forrester is generally credited with inventing the first practical magnetic-core memory).

Olsen was known throughout his career for his management style and his fostering of engineering innovation. Olsen&#x27;s valuing of innovation and technical excellence spawned and popularized techniques such as engineering matrix management, that are broadly employed today throughout many industries. Olsen valued humility, driving an economy car and keeping a simple office in an old mill building. He also was an accomplished pilot and flew his own plane.

In 1977, referring to computers used in home automation at the dawn of the home computer era, Olsen is quoted as saying &quot;There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.&quot; Olsen admitted to making the remark, even though he says his words were taken out of context and he was referring to computers set up to control houses, not PCs. According to Snopes.com, &quot;the out-of-context misinterpretation of Olsen&#x27;s comments is considered much more amusing and entertaining than what he really meant, so that is the version that has been promulgated for decades now&quot;.

In 1986, Fortune Magazine named Olsen &quot;America&#x27;s most successful entrepreneur&quot;, and the same year he received the IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award. Olsen was the subject of a 1988 biography, &quot;The Ultimate Entrepreneur: The Story of Ken Olsen and Digital Equipment Corporation&quot; written by Glenn Rifkin and George Harrar.

In 1993, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers awarded Olsen their IEEE Founders Medal.

He was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum in 1996. He was awarded the Vermilye Medal in 1980. He was inducted as an Honorary Member of UPE (the International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Sciences) on October 8, 1975.

In 2011, he was listed at #6 on the MIT150 list of the top 150 innovators and ideas from MIT for his work on the minicomputer.

==Later career history==
Commencing in 1987, Olsen in public appearances described UNIX as &quot;snake oil&quot;. Some believed he was making a general characterization of UNIX, while others believed he was specifically referring to its marketing exaggerating its benefits. While Olsen believed VMS was a better solution for DEC customers and often talked of the strengths of the system, he did approve and encourage an internal effort to produce a native BSD-based UNIX product on the VAX line of computers called Ultrix. However, this line never got enthusiastic comprehensive support at DEC.

Olsen was forced to retire from DEC, stepping down as president in 1992. He subsequently became the chairman of Advanced Modular Solutions. Olsen was also a major contributor to The Family, a religious and political organization.

Olsen was a trustee of Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. There, the Ken Olsen Science Center was named after him in 2006, and dedicated on 27 September 2008. Its lobby features a &quot;Digital Loggia of Technology&quot;, documenting Digital&#x27;s technology and history, and an interactive kiosk to which former employees have submitted their stories.

==Death==
Olsen died while in hospice care in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 6, 2011, aged 84. Gordon College, where he was a trustee and board member, announced his death, but did not reveal the cause. His family also did not comment on any details surrounding his death.

<doc id="538749" wikidata="Q120631" url="?curid=538749" title="Nashville Skyline">
<text>Nashville Skyline is the ninth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on April 9, 1969, by Columbia Records as LP record, reel-to-reel tape, and audio cassette.

Building on the rustic style he experimented with on &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; displayed a complete immersion into country music. Along with the more basic lyrical themes, simple songwriting structures, and charming domestic feel, it introduced audiences to a radically new singing voice from Dylan, who had temporarily quit smoking—a soft, affected country croon.

The result received a generally positive reaction from critics, and was a commercial success. Reaching in the U.S., the album also scored Dylan his fourth UK No. 1 album.

== Background ==
The concept of recording a country album in Nashville was first discussed with Dylan in 1965 by Johnny Cash, who expressed interest in producing such an album. &quot;I&#x27;ve got my own ideas about that Nashville sound and I&#x27;d like to try it with Bob,&quot; Cash said in a March 1965 interview with Music Business magazine. Those sessions never materialized and by June of that year, Dylan was going fully electric with the recording of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. By the time &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; was recorded, the political climate in the United States had grown more polarized. In 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy (a leading candidate for the presidency) were assassinated. Riots broke out in most major American cities, including a major one surrounding the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and racially motivated conflagrations spurred by King&#x27;s assassination. A new president, Richard Nixon, was sworn into office in January 1969, but the U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia, particularly the Vietnam War, would continue for several years. Protests over a wide range of political topics became more frequent. Dylan had been a leading cultural figure, noted for political and social commentary throughout the 1960s. Even as he moved away from topical songs, he never lost his cultural stature. However, as Clinton Heylin wrote of &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, &quot;If Dylan was concerned about retaining a hold on the rock constituency, making albums with Johnny Cash in Nashville was tantamount to abdication in many eyes.&quot;

&quot;Our generation owes him our artistic lives,&quot; observed Kris Kristofferson, who later sang with Cash in The Highwaymen, &quot;because he opened all the doors in Nashville when he did &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;. The country scene was so conservative until he arrived. He brought in a whole new audience. He changed the way people thought about it – even the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; was never the same again.&quot;

Helped by a promotional appearance on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; on June 7, &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; went on to become one of Dylan&#x27;s best-selling albums. Three singles were pulled from it, all of which received significant airplay on AM radio.

==Critical reception and legacy==

Despite the dramatic, commercial shift in direction, the press also gave &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; a warm reception. A critic for &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote of &quot;the great charm... and the ways Dylan, both as composer and performer, has found to exploit subtle differences on a deliberately limited emotional and verbal scale.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Paul Nelson wrote, &quot;&quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; achieves the artistically impossible: a deep, humane, and interesting statement about being happy. It could well be... his best album.&quot; However, Nelson would reconsider his opinion in a review for &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits Vol. II&quot; less than three years later, writing, &quot;I was misinformed. That&#x27;s why no one should pay any attention to critics, especially the artist.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau argued that &quot;the beauty of the album&quot; was in the &quot;totally undemanding&quot; and &quot;one-dimensional&quot; quality of the songs, believing Dylan had toyed with the public&#x27;s expectations again by embracing a country tenor voice and aesthetic. He later included it in his &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). It was voted number 579 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

A few critics expressed some disappointment. Ed Ochs of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;the satisfied man speaks in clichés, and blushes as if every day were Valentine&#x27;s Day.&quot; Tim Souster of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;One can&#x27;t help feeling something is missing. Isn&#x27;t this idyllic country landscape too good to be true?&quot;

Hip hop group Public Enemy reference it in their 2007 Dylan tribute song &quot;Long and Whining Road&quot;: &quot;Fans, if it&#x27;s not for you, there&#x27;d be no PE / From the Nashville Skyline, to the homeboys and girls of South Country&quot;.

<text>Abraham Baldwin (November 22, 1754March 4, 1807) was an American minister, patriot, politician, and Founding Father who signed the United States Constitution. Born and raised in Connecticut, he was a 1772 graduate of Yale College. After the Revolutionary War, Baldwin became a lawyer. He moved to the U.S. state of Georgia in the mid-1780s and founded the University of Georgia. Baldwin was a member of Society of the Cincinnati.

Baldwin served as a United States Senator from Georgia from 1799 to 1807. During his tenure, he served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate from 1801 to 1802.

==Early life, education and career==
Abraham Baldwin was born in 1754 in Guildford in the Connecticut Colony into a large family, the son of Lucy (Dudley) and Michael Baldwin, a blacksmith, and descended from Elder John Strong. His half-brother, Henry Baldwin, was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. After attending Guildford Grammar School, Abraham Baldwin attended Yale College in nearby New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a member of the Linonian Society. He graduated in 1772.

Three years later after theological study, he was licensed as a Congregationalist minister. He also served as a tutor at the college. He held that position until 1779. During the American Revolutionary War, he served as a chaplain in the Connecticut Contingent of the Continental Army. He did not see combat while with the Continental troops. Two years later at the conclusion of the war, Baldwin declined an offer from Yale&#x27;s new president, Ezra Stiles, to become Professor of Divinity. Instead, he turned to the study of law and in 1783 was admitted to the Connecticut bar.

==Move to Georgia==
Encouraged by his former commanding officer General Nathanael Greene, who had acquired the plantation at Mulberry Grove where Eli Whitney would later invent the cotton gin, Baldwin moved to Georgia. He was recruited by fellow Yale alumnus Governor Lyman Hall, another transplanted New Englander, to develop a state education plan. Baldwin was named the first president of the University of Georgia and became active in politics to build support for the university, which had not yet enrolled its first student. He was appointed as a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation and then to the Constitutional Convention; in September 1786 he was one of the state’s two signatories to the U.S. Constitution.
Baldwin remained president of the University of Georgia during its initial development phase until 1800. During this period, he also worked with the legislature on the college charter. In 1801, Franklin College, the University of Georgia&#x27;s initial college, opened to students. Josiah Meigs was hired to succeed Baldwin as first acting president and oversee the inaugural class of students. The first buildings of the college were architecturally modeled on Baldwin&#x27;s and Meigs&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot; of Yale where they both had taught. (Later the university sports team adopted as its mascot the bulldog, also in tribute to Baldwin and Meigs, as it is the mascot of Yale.)

==Politics==

Baldwin was elected to the Georgia Assembly, where he became very active, working to develop support for the college. He was able to mediate between the rougher frontiersmen, perhaps because of his childhood as the son of a blacksmith, and the aristocratic planter elite who dominated the coastal Lowcountry. He became one of the most prominent legislators, pushing significant measures such as the education bill through the sometimes split Georgia Assembly.

He was elected as representative to the U.S. Congress in 1788. The Georgia legislature elected him as U.S. Senator in 1799 (this was the practice until popular election in 1913.) He served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate from December 1801 to December 1802. He was re-elected and served in office until his death.

==Death and legacy==
On March 4, 1807, at age 52, Baldwin died while serving as a U.S. senator from Georgia. Later that month the &quot;Savannah Republican&quot; and &quot;Savannah Evening Ledger&quot; reprinted an obituary that had first been published in a Washington, D.C., newspaper: &quot;He originated the plan of The University of Georgia, drew up the charter, and with infinite labor and patience, in vanquishing all sorts of prejudices and removing every obstruction, he persuaded the assembly to adopt it.&quot; His remains are interred at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, DC.
* The United States Postal Service made a 7¢ Great Americans series postage stamp in his honor;
* Places and institutions were named for him, including:
** Baldwin County in Alabama and Georgia;
** Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, Georgia;
** Abraham Baldwin Middle School in Guilford, Connecticut;
** Baldwin streets in Madison, Wisconsin and Athens, Georgia;
* The University of Georgia erected a statue of Baldwin on the historic North Campus quad in his honor as its founding father.

<doc id="538756" wikidata="Q2287486" url="?curid=538756" title="Simon Fraser Tolmie">
<text>Simon Fraser Tolmie, (25 January 1867 – 13 October 1937) was a veterinarian, farmer, politician, and the 21st premier of British Columbia, Canada.

== Early life ==

Tolmie had a pioneer lineage, which aided him in his political aspirations. He was the son of Dr. William Fraser Tolmie, a prominent figure in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and a member of both the colonial assembly of Colony of Vancouver Island and the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. William Fraser was early supporter of Scottish industrialist reformer Robert Owen, and was a strong supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage in British Columbia. His maternal ancestry was Métis and representative of the marriages of First Nations women and French and Scottish men who worked in the fur trade. Tolmie&#x27;s mother, Jane Work, was the daughter of John Work, a prominent Victoria resident, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Chief Factor, and member of the former colony&#x27;s assembly. Jane&#x27;s mother was Josette Legace, a Métis daughter of a First Nations woman from the Spokane area and Pierre Legace, a French-Canadian trapper father. Born in Victoria, Tolmie spent his early life on his family&#x27;s vast farm, Cloverdale (the Victoria neighbourhood bears its name). He graduated from the Ontario Veterinary College in 1891 and later became the Dominion Inspector of Livestock.

== Early political career ==

Tolmie entered federal politics in the election of 1917, becoming Unionist MP for Victoria City. He was returned in the subsequent four elections as a Conservative (the riding changed its name to Victoria in 1924). Tolmie served as Minister of Agriculture in the governments of Sir Robert Borden and Arthur Meighen from 1919–1921, and in 1926.

Tolmie was part of a general anti-drug panic in 1922 with severe racist overtones. He supported amendments to drug laws calling for the deportation of all Asians convicted of trafficking and for the use of the &#x27;lash&#x27;.

== Premier of British Columbia ==

Tolmie was elected leader of the British Columbia Conservative Party in 1926 but continued to sit as a Member of Parliament until the 1928 provincial election, in which he ran and was elected MLA for Saanich. The Conservatives were victorious that year, taking 32 of the legislature&#x27;s 48 seats, including every seat in Vancouver and Victoria. Tolmie thus became Premier of the province, also serving as Minister of Railways. Between 1 June and 15 November 1933, he further served as the province&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture and President of the Council.

Like their federal counterparts, who returned to power in 1930, Tolmie&#x27;s Tories&#x27; commitment to applying &quot;business principles to the business of government,&quot; rebounded to their disadvantage when the Great Depression hit. By 1931, unemployment reached 28% - the highest in Canada - and Tolmie was finally forced to act, setting up remote relief camps. Tolmie acceded to the request from the business community that a royal commission be established to propose solutions to the province&#x27;s increasingly dire financial situation. The Kidd Report, issued in 1932, recommended such sharp cuts to social services that mainstream British Columbians were enraged. They had come to expect more from their provincial government than its traditional functions of maintaining law and order, providing physical infrastructure and encouraging private enterprise.

The strained situation took its toll on the provincial party, which became so wracked by internal discord that the executive decided to run no candidates in the 1933 election. Rather, each local riding association acted on its own. Some candidates ran as independents, some as Independent Conservatives. Those supporting Tolmie, ran as Unionists, and those grouped around William John Bowser, a former premier, ran as Non-Partisans. The result was easily foreseen. The Liberals captured 42% of the vote and 34 of the 47 seats, the new social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation became the official opposition, and the Conservatives who had run under various banners picked up just five seats. Tolmie lost his own seat.

== Later life ==

Tolmie returned to politics three years later, returning to his old federal seat of Victoria in a 1936 by-election. He died in Victoria a little over a year later.

Tolmie led the last Conservative provincial government in British Columbia.

<text>Robert Andrew Kreinar (November 26, 1937 – July 16, 2012), known as Bob Babbitt, was an American bassist, most famous for his work as a member of Motown Records&#x27; studio band, the Funk Brothers, from 1966 to 1972, as well as his tenure as part of MFSB for Philadelphia International Records afterwards. Also in 1968, with Mike Campbell, Ray Monette and Andrew Smith, he formed the band Scorpion, which lasted until 1970. He is ranked number 59 on &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time&quot;.

==Biography==
At Motown, Babbitt traded off sessions with original Motown bassist James Jamerson. When Motown moved to Los Angeles, Babbitt went in the opposite direction and ended up in New York as well as making occasional trips to Philadelphia. In this new city, he worked on recordings for Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow, Gloria Gaynor, Robert Palmer, and Alice Cooper. During this time, his most notable successes were &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot;(1973) by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips and &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot; by The Spinners.

The Pittsburgh-born Babbitt&#x27;s most notable bass performances include &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I&#x27;m Yours&quot; (1970) by Stevie Wonder; &quot;War&quot; (1970) by Edwin Starr; &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot; (1970) by Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles; &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; (1971) and &quot;Inner City Blues&quot; (1971) by Marvin Gaye; &quot;Band of Gold&quot; (1970) by Freda Payne; &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot;, &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot; (1971) and &quot;Masterpiece&quot; (1973) by The Temptations; &quot;Scorpio&quot; (1971) by Dennis Coffey; and &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Want to Be Lonely&quot; (1973) by The Main Ingredient.

He participated in hundreds of other hits, including &quot;Little Town Flirt&quot; by Del Shannon and &quot;Scorpio&quot; by Dennis Coffey &amp; the Detroit Guitar Band. He played on the Jimi Hendrix album &quot;Crash Landing&quot;. He also played bass on Cindy Bullens&#x27; 1979 album &quot;Desire Wire&quot;. He accepted an offer from Phil Collins to perform on his album of Motown and 1960s soul classics, &quot;Going Back&quot;, and also appeared in Collins&#x27; &quot;Going Back – Live at Roseland Ballroom, NYC&quot; concert DVD. He appeared on stage in an episode of &quot;American Idol&quot;, backing up Jacob Lusk&#x27;s performance of &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot; for AI&#x27;s Motown Week in March 2011.
In 2003, Babbitt played on Marion James&#x27; album &quot;Essence&quot;, and amongst others playing on the record were Beegie Adair, Reese Wynans, Jack Pearson (The Allman Brothers), and drummer Chucki Burke.

He was added to the Music City Walk of Fame in June 2012.

Babbitt died on July 16, 2012, aged 74, from brain cancer.

<text>The Pak Mun Dam (, , ) is a barrage dam and run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant 5.5 km west of the confluence of the Mun and Mekong Rivers in Khong Chiam District, Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand. It was constructed by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) with support from the World Bank at a total cost of US$240 million, and completed in 1994.

==Environmental impact==
The project has been criticized for adverse effects on the fisheries of the Mun River, insufficient compensation payments to affected villagers, and failure to produce the projected power output. The immediate impact of the dam was to flood 117 km2 of land and displace families. The original plan estimated the displacement of 262 families. In the end, 912 families were displaced and 780 households lost all or part of their land. In all, around 25,000 villagers claim to have been affected by the dam. Protests have been staged at the dam site and outside Government House in Bangkok and critics have called for the dam to be immediately decommissioned. , EGAT had paid out 377.7 million baht in relocation compensation, plus 356.9 million baht for loss of fisheries with unsettled fisheries claims amounting to an additional 200 million baht.

In response to concerns about the dam&#x27;s likely impact on fisheries on the Mun River, a fish ladder was incorporated into the scheme to allow fish into the Mun River to spawn. The fish ladder has been &quot;unsuccessful&quot;. A report from the World Commission on Dams found that of 265 fish species previously found in the Mun River, at least 50 had disappeared and numbers of others had declined significantly. The fish catch decreased by 60–80%. It is uncertain what proportion of this decrease is attributable to the dam, and what proportion to other factors.

In response to protests, the government opened the dam gates temporarily in June 2001. Subsequently, a study by Ubon Ratchathani University recommended keeping the gates open for a further five years, and a study by Living River Siam recommended decommissioning the dam. Instead, the Thai Cabinet decided to close the gates for eight months each year from November 2002.

As part of a two-year study to review the development effectiveness of large dams, the World Commission on Dams (WCD) commissioned the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) to conduct a case study on the Pak Mun Dam. TDRI&#x27;s report, published in 2000, concluded that &quot;...EGAT over-stated the case of project benefits and did no justice to the method of benefit-cost analysis in exaggerating the value of net gains in power production and in claiming irrigation benefits on invalid grounds.&quot;

<text>A review is an evaluation of a publication, product, service, or company or a critical take on current affairs in literature, politics or culture. In addition to a critical evaluation, the review&#x27;s author may assign the work a rating to indicate its relative merit. 

Reviews can apply to a movie, video game, musical composition, book; a piece of hardware like a car, home appliance, or computer; or software such as business software, sales software; or an event or performance, such as a live music concert, play, musical theater show, dance show or art exhibition. In the cultural sphere, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, for instance, is a collection of essays on literature, culture, and current affairs.

==In academia==
==User review==
A user review refers to a review written by a user or consumer of a product or service based on the author&#x27;s own experience as a user of the reviewed product. Popular sources for consumer reviews are e-commerce sites like Amazon.com and Zappos and social media sites like Tripadvisor and Yelp. E-commerce sites often have consumer reviews for products and sellers separately. Usually, consumer reviews are in the form of several lines of text accompanied by a numerical rating. This text is meant to aid in shopping decision of a prospective buyer. A consumer review of a product usually comments on how well the product measures up to expectations based on the specifications provided by the manufacturer or seller. It talks about performance, reliability, quality defects, if any, and value for money. Consumer reviews, also called &#x27;word of mouth&#x27; and &#x27;user-generated content&#x27; differ from &#x27;marketer-generated content&#x27; in their evaluation from consumer or user point of view. They often include comparative evaluations against competing products. Observations are factual as well as subjective in nature. Consumer reviews of sellers usually comment on service experienced, and dependability or trustworthiness of the seller. Usually, they comment on factors such as timeliness of delivery, packaging, and correctness of delivered items, shipping charges, return services against promises made, and so on.

Online consumer reviews have become a major factor in business reputation and brand image due to the popularity of TripAdvisor, Yelp, and online review websites. A negative review can damage the reputation of a business and this has created a new industry of reputation management where companies attempt to remove or hide bad reviews so that more favourable content is found when potential customers do research.

An &quot;expert review&quot; usually refers to a review written by someone who has tested several peer products or services to identify which offers the best value for money or the best set of features. An example of this is Amazon Vine. Amazon Vine is a program which was introduced to &quot;help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions&quot;. This program is invite-only and is designed to generate reviews for product vendors with whom Amazon works.

One type of user review can be in the physical world, such as a video reviewing a product or software. This is common on platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo.

==Book review==
A book review (or book report) is a form of criticism in which a book is analyzed based on content, style, and merit. It is often carried out in periodicals, as school work, or online. Its length may vary from a single paragraph to a substantial essay. In the case of a work of poetry or fiction, or of nonfiction in which the literary merits of the work are an important element, a review will commonly use the methods of literary criticism. Such a review often contains evaluations of the book on the basis of personal taste. Reviewers, in literary periodicals, often use the occasion of a book review for a display of learning or to promulgate their own ideas on the topic of a fiction or non-fiction work. At the other end of the spectrum, some book reviews resemble simple plot summaries. Reviews of non-fiction works intended for instructional or informational purposes may focus more directly on concerns such as practical usefulness and reader-friendliness.

==Music reviews==

===Performance reviews===
Reviews of live music performances are typically short articles that tell readers about the performers or group(s) that were involved and the pieces or songs that were performed. The comments made by reviewers fall, roughly into two categories: technical comments and subjective/artistic comments. The elements in the &quot;technical&quot; category include rhythmic &quot;togetherness&quot;, intonation, errors or slip-ups, and so on. These elements are fairly &quot;black and white&quot;; a pianist playing a concerto either played the right notes on a climactic scale run, or she missed it. The subjective comments refer to elements which are a matter of taste. The balance between the different elements in a review (information about the performer or group; information about the pieces/songs; commentary about the technical and subjective elements of the performance) depends on the audience that a music critic is writing for. Music reviewers writing in local newspapers or general-interest magazines may not be able to assume that the readers will be familiar with music performers and pieces/songs, so they may decide to include a great deal of &quot;background&quot; information.

===Recording reviews===
Music critics and music writers also review recordings of music, including individual songs or pieces or entire albums. In the case of a review of an entire album, the reviewer will not only judge the individual songs or pieces; they will also judge how well all of the songs or pieces work together or go together.

The age of digital downloads may considerably change the album review. Where previously albums were purchased as collections of songs, often with a common theme, the rise of individual song downloads may have significant impact on consumers&#x27; exposure to an artist&#x27;s music. Die-hard fans will most likely continue to explore an artist&#x27;s complete work, but individuals will most likely make significantly different choices and &quot;cherry-pick&quot; songs they have been exposed to. The concept of &quot;singles&quot; or individual hits marked for retail has been around for long time; however, the price for a single in the days of CDs or 45&#x27;s was much closer to the complete album price. When you consider that each song on an artist&#x27;s album is often priced at the same amount, the odds of the average consumer purchase the entire album instead of selecting the &quot;hit&quot; songs decreases significantly.

===Composition reviews===
In classical music, music critics may also do reviews of compositions, even if the piece or song has never been performed and it only exists on manuscript paper in a score. To review a composition in this fashion, the critic will use music theory skills such as harmonic analysis and thematic analysis, along with their knowledge of idioms and compositional practices etc.

==Motion picture, television and video reviews==
A motion picture review is a work of film criticism addressing the merits of one or more motion pictures. Generally, the term &quot;movie review&quot; implies a work of journalistic film criticism rather than of academic criticism. Such reviews have appeared in newspapers and printed periodicals since the beginning of the film industry, and now are published in general-interest websites as well as specialized film and film review sites. Television programs and other videos are now commonly reviewed in similar venues and by similar methods.

==Bought review==
A &quot;bought review&quot; is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review his new product. Primarily used in the car, movie, and game industry this system creates a kind of undercover advertising. Bought reviews tend to be biased due to the informative value of reviews. In some cases, a bought review may be independent, if the person that is hired to do the review has a strong reputation for independence and integrity. Even if a &quot;bought review&quot; from a respected critic is actually independent, the perception of potential bias will remain, due to the financial relationship between the company and the critic.

A similar type of review that may be biased is the so-called &quot;puff piece&quot;, a review of &quot;[a product]&quot;, film, or event that is written by a sympathetic reviewer or by an individual who has a connection to the product or event in question, either in terms of an employment relationship or other links. For example, a major media conglomerate that owns both print media and record companies may instruct one of its employees in one of its newspapers to do a review of an album which is being released by the conglomerate&#x27;s record company. Although some journalists may assert their professional independence and integrity, and insist on producing an unbiased review, in other cases, writers may succumb to the pressure and pen a biased &quot;puff piece&quot; which praises the product or event while omitting any discussion of any shortcomings. In some cases, &quot;puff pieces&quot; purport to provide a review of the product or event, but instead merely provide &quot;peacock words&quot; (&quot;An amazing recording&quot;); &quot;weasel words&quot; and tabloid-style filler which is peripheral or irrelevant to assessing the qualities of the product or event (&quot;During the filming, there were rumors that romantic sparks flew between the two co-leads, who were often seen talking together on the set&quot;).

Several online review manipulation strategies have also been reported, such as writing fake reviews and offering monetary compensation to remove negative reviews.

<doc id="538780" wikidata="Q390114" url="?curid=538780" title="LaSalle (automobile)">
<text>LaSalle was an American brand of luxury automobiles manufactured and marketed, as a separate brand, by General Motors&#x27; Cadillac division from 1927 through 1940. Alfred P. Sloan, GM&#x27;s Chairman of the Board, developed the concept for four new GM marques - LaSalle, Marquette, Viking and Pontiac - paired with already established brands to fill price gaps he perceived in the General Motors product portfolio. Sloan created LaSalle as a companion marque for Cadillac. LaSalle automobiles were manufactured by Cadillac, but were priced lower than Cadillac-branded automobiles, were shorter, and were marketed as the second-most prestigious marque in the General Motors portfolio. LaSalles were titled as LaSalles, and not as Cadillacs. Like Cadillac — named after Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac — the LaSalle brand name was based on that of another French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. 

==General Motors companion marque strategy==
The LaSalle had its beginnings when General Motors&#x27; CEO Alfred P. Sloan noticed that his carefully crafted market segmentation program was beginning to develop price gaps in which General Motors had no products to sell. In an era when American automotive brands were typically restricted to building a specific car per model year, Sloan surmised that the best way to bridge the gaps was to develop &quot;companion&quot; marques that could be sold through the current sales network.

As originally developed by Sloan, General Motors&#x27; market-segmentation strategy placed each of the company&#x27;s individual automobile marques into specific price ranges, called the &quot;General Motors companion make program&quot;. The Chevrolet was designated as the entry-level product. Next, (in ascending order), came the Pontiac, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Viking, Marquette, Buick, LaSalle, and Cadillac. By the 1920s, certain General Motors products began to shift out of the plan as the products improved and engine advances were made.

Under the companion marque strategy, the gap between the Chevrolet and the Oakland would be filled by a new marque named Pontiac, a quality six-cylinder car designed to sell for the price of a four-cylinder. The wide gap between Oldsmobile and Buick would be filled by two companion marques: Oldsmobile was assigned the up-market, V8 engined Viking, while Buick was assigned the more compact six-cylinder Marquette brand. Cadillac, which had seen its base prices soar in the heady 1920s, was assigned the LaSalle as a companion marque to fill the gap that existed between it and Buick.

== Design strategy ==

What emerged as the LaSalle in 1927 was introduced on the GM C platform with the Cadillac V8. The 1927 LaSalle was designed by Harley Earl, who had a 30-year career at General Motors, eventually gaining control of all design and styling at General Motors.

Prior to the 1927 LaSalle, automobile design essentially followed a set pattern, with design changes driven principally by engineering needs. For example, the Ford Model T evolved only slightly over its production run; A 1927 Model T was almost identical to a 1910 Model T, while GM made yearly appearance and model name changes across all brands starting in 1908.

Earl, who had been hired by Cadillac&#x27;s General Manager, Lawrence P. Fisher, conceived the LaSalle not as a junior Cadillac, but as something more agile and stylish. Influenced by the rakish Hispano-Suiza roadsters of the time, Earl&#x27;s LaSalle emerged as a shorter, yet elegant, counterpoint to Cadillac&#x27;s larger cars, unlike anything else built by an American automotive manufacturer.

==1927–1933==

Built by Cadillac to its high standards but at a dedicated factory at Wyoming Road Assembly, the LaSalle soon emerged as a trend-setting automobile. Earl was then placed in charge of overseeing the design of all of General Motors&#x27; vehicles. Earl&#x27;s design even included a nod to the inspirational Hispano-Suiza H6, with the marque&#x27;s circled trademark &quot;LaS&quot; cast into the horizontal tie bar between the front lights.

There were two wheelbase choices where Fisher offered eight selections while Fleetwood Metal Body offered four coachwork choices on the shorter while only Fisher offered an additional three coachwork choices on the longer . For 1927, the most exclusive Fleetwood body was the Transformable Town Cabriolet at US$4,700 ($ in dollars ). The LaSalles of this era were equipped with Cadillac&#x27;s &quot;Ninety Degree V-8&quot;, making the car fast, while its smaller size made it sportier and more agile.

On June 20, 1927, a LaSalle driven by Willard Rader, along with Gus Bell, on the track at the Milford Proving Grounds, achieved , averaging , with only seven minutes given over to refueling and tire changes. In comparison, the average speed at that year&#x27;s Indianapolis 500 was . The test at Milford would have continued, but a problem in the oil system drew the test to an early close.

The Series 303 continued for 1928, and as LaSalle sales began to progress, engineering advancements, appearance changes and optional equipment choices continued. Shock absorbers were now sourced from Lovejoy hydraulic units and the clutch was now upgraded to twin discs. The list of available coachwork choices from Fisher expanded to eleven selections on the 125&quot; wheelbase and six choices on the 134&quot;, while Fleetwood now provided two choices on the 125&quot; and only one choice on the 134&quot;, that being the Transformable Town Cabriolet at US$4,900 ($ in dollars ).

The first engine upgrade to the LaSalle was introduced in 1929 with the Series 328, which had slight differences to the Cadillac V8 which was also upgraded. The Victoria and business coupe were replaced with the Landau Cabriolet from Fisher while Fleetwood choices were all cabriolet coupes or sedans. Both wheelbase choices were both available for Fisher and Fleetwood coachwork selections. September 1929 is when Cadillac introduced its all-new 1930 Series 353, one month before the Cadillac V-12 and the Wall Street Crash of 1929

The ultra-luxury Cadillac V-16 made its grand introduction January 1930, and the LaSalle received another engine upgrade introduced in the LaSalle Series 340. Fisher body selections were reduced to seven closed while Fleetwood choices expanded to six. The only wheelbase used was 134&quot; and a radio was first introduced as an optional item for US$175 ($ in dollars ) and all LaSalle&#x27;s were prewired with an antenna imbedded in the roof. Wheels were available in hickory artillery style, wire wheels or solid pressed steel discs. The engine displacement of the 1930 LaSalle and the 1928–1929 Cadillac Series 341 were essentially identical so the LaSalle was labeled as Series 340 while the 1930 Cadillac V8 was upgraded to Series 353. In an attempt to further add exclusivity, Fleetwood convertible coachwork selections were further distinguished by the descriptions &quot;Fleetcliffe&quot;, &quot;Fleetlands&quot;, &quot;Fleetway&quot; and &quot;Fleetwind&quot; which didn&#x27;t continue for 1931. The next vehicle choice offered by GM was the all-new Buick Series 50 coupe or sedan with a straight-eight engine with a similar appearance and a Fisher Body for US$1,540 ($ in dollars ) while a LaSalle Series 340 sedan was listed at US$2,565 ($ in dollars ).

The 1931 LaSalle&#x27;s engine was again upgraded and the Series 345-A appeared with the same appearance, engineering and optional equipment changes. Fisher and Fleetwood coachwork choices were again changed based on popularity, and additional optional equipment was added retaining the 134&quot; wheelbase used the previous year. The Cadillac Heron or Goddess hood ornament made the options list for US$20 ($ in dollars ) while the latest fashion accessory called a radiator rock screen could be installed for US$33 ($ in dollars ).

From the mid-1910s, a V8 engine was regarded as a luxury expectation, while other manufacturers remained with straight-8 engines, but in 1932 the Ford V8 was introduced with a standard equipment V8 displacing . Body style selections and a wide arrange of Duco automotive lacquer paint color selections, introduced by DuPont, were beginning to become commonplace. The 1932 LaSalle Series 345-B and 1933 Series 345-C followed the same pattern of appearance, engineering upgrades and ever-growing options list.

==1934–1938==

Beginning with the 1934 model year, a significant portion of the LaSalle, now called the Series 50 Model 350, was more closely related to the Oldsmobile L-Series, Buick Series 40 and Buick Series 50 while sharing an appearance with the senior Cadillac Series 355s. This was marked by a shift to the Oldsmobile- and Buick-based B platform. Again, Earl&#x27;s work with the LaSalle resulted in a graceful vehicle, led by an elegantly thin grille that now concealed the previously exposed radiator, which was shared with Cadillac and Pontiac for that year. Earl&#x27;s other contribution was the modern, airplane-styled, semi-shielded portholes along the side of the hood. All bodies were now made by Fleetwood. 1933 was the first year all GM vehicles were installed with optional vent windows which were initially called “No Draft Individually Controlled Ventilation” later renamed &quot;Ventiplanes&quot; which the patent application was filed on Nov. 28, 1932. It was assigned to the Ternstedt Manufacturing Company, a GM subsidiary that manufactured components for Fisher Body and they were introduced on the Series 50 in 1934.

The Series 50 was also no longer available with a V8, which was a distinction shared with all Cadillacs, and now only available with an Oldsmobile sourced flathead inline-eight, while Buick continued to offer the more technologically advanced overhead valve straight-eight engine exclusive to Buick. The LaSalle was the first Cadillac to use hydraulic brakes sourced from Bendix and various components were sourced from within different GM Divisions in order to cut production costs. The Oldsmobile engine was not assembled by Oldsmobile then supplied to the LaSalle factory, instead the parts were sent to the LaSalle factory and assembled by Cadillac-trained LaSalle assembly teams to authentically declare it was manufactured by Cadillac engineers. The LaSalle sales department further invited clients to witness the cars being manufactured and listed the different companies that sourced various items that were used to manufacture the 1934 LaSalle.

This LaSalle Series 50 Model 350 listed at US$1,550 ($ in dollars ) for a choice of coupes, sedans or convertibles and was now priced US$1,000 ($ in dollars ) below the least expensive Cadillac. Its mission was not to fill a price gap, but to keep the luxury-car division out of the red. But as the economy began to recover, the LaSalle did not, at least not commensurate with the economy. Sales were 7,195 in 1934, 8,651 in 1935 and 13,004 in 1936 while Buick appeared to be more attractive yet frugal.

To further emphasize that the 1935 LaSalle was improved from the previous model, the name was, again, changed to Series 35-50, dropping the &quot;model&quot; designation, while the vehicle was largely the same with the usual appearance, options list changes, and mechanical advancements. Meanwhile, the Packard One-Twenty had been introduced in 1935 and was very successful. For 1936 the LaSalle was renamed the Series 36-50 and had additional competition from the Lincoln-Zephyr, introduced in 1936. The 1937 LaSalle was called the Series 37-50, a naming convention that would continue with the last LaSalle Series 40-50 and 40-52.

For 1937, Cadillac made the LaSalle its own again, giving it the designation Series 37-50 and the monobloc V8 of the Series 60, new styling, a lower price range, and a heavy promotion emphasizing that the car was completely Cadillac-built. It was too late. Model year sales of 32,000 LaSalles was a great improvement, but it remained far behind the Packard.

A 1934 LaSalle Series 50 Model 350 was chosen as the Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500, and a 1937 LaSalle Series 37-50 convertible also served as an Indy 500 Pace Car.

==1939–1941==

In its final years, the LaSalle Series 39-50 was once again more Cadillac-like in its appearance and details, and was essentially identical to the Cadillac Series 61. The narrow radiator grille opening was retained and was flanked by additional side grille work which aided in heat dissipation from the engine. Headlights, which had moved down and been secured to the body between the grille and the fender, were again attached to the radiator shell. LaSalle also added a sunroof, marketed as the &quot;Sunshine Turret Top&quot;. Sales climbed from 15,501 in 1938 to 23,028 in 1939.

The final 1940 LaSalles were introduced in October 1939 with a full array of semi-custom body styles, as it had in its first year, including a convertible sedan. Earl oversaw this redesign. The LaSalle emerged with a smooth-flowing design, its thin radiator flanked by a series of thin chrome slots. In its final year, sales of the LaSalle reached the second-highest level ever at 24,133. In addition to the Series 40-50, there was also the lower, wider Series 40-52 Special using General Motors&#x27; new &quot;Torpedo&quot;-style body.

===1941===
By the time the decision was made to drop the LaSalle, at least three wood-and-metal mockups had been made for potential 1941 LaSalle models. One was based on the notchback GM C platform, which ended up being shared by the Cadillac Series 62, the Buick Roadmaster and Super, the Oldsmobile 90, and the Pontiac Custom Torpedo. A second was based on the fastback GM B platform, which was eventually shared by the Cadillac Series 61, the Buick Century and Special, the Oldsmobile 70, and the Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo. A third was a modified notchback design, derived from the fastback B-body, but described as &quot;A-body-like&quot;, that was finally used by the Cadillac Series 63. Any or all of these could have ended up being part of the next LaSalle line. However, it is widely believed that of the three, the third design was most likely to have been a LaSalle, with that platform being assigned exclusively to LaSalle, and that the second design, whose platform was shared with the Series 61, was the next-most-likely. In 1941, sales of the Cadillac Series 61 and 63 were 29,258 and 5,030, respectively.

In retrospect, LaSalle sales initially had exceeded Cadillac&#x27;s since 1933, but since its introduction in 1935, the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935–1940 inclusively. It was decided to fold the LaSalle into the more prestigious Cadillac marque. LaSalle did not have the time to develop a prestigious name before the onset of the Great Depression and did not have the opportunity afterward. The Great Depression, combined with LaSalle&#x27;s stalling sales numbers, caused Cadillac to rethink its companion make. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had eliminated the Marquette and the Viking in 1930, their second model year. Cadillac also saw sales of its cars losing ground, as confirmed Cadillac buyers tried to trim pennies by buying the less expensive LaSalle. LaSalle sales also were falling, from a high of 22,691 models in 1929 to a low of 3,290 in 1932.

While the introduction of LaSalle showed there was a market for a luxury car that was more conservative in appearance and price, GM already had Buick which filled that role very successfully. The attention given to LaSalle could have been invested in Buick as the mainstream luxury brand, and concentrated on Cadillac being more elusive and unique to protect the brand image. The introduction of the &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot; headed up by Harley Earl and a shared design theme in all GM products further complicated the brand distinction between the original brands in that the only differences among Oldsmobile, Buick, LaSalle, and Cadillac were exterior design appearance, wheelbase length, and colors, while charging extra due to marketing and pricing objectives.

==LaSalle concept vehicles==
In his 2013 article, &quot;GM&#x27;s Road Not Taken&quot;, Robert Cumberford reviewed the restoration of GM&#x27;s 1955 Motorama La Salle II Roadster. Cumberford likened the Roadster to a harbinger of GM&#x27;s future. While the Roadster concept showcased important new technology, including an aluminum block, double overhead cam and fuel-injected V6, the technology went unrealized. GM instead emphasized styling over engineering advancement for the decades that followed and did not bring &quot;an aluminum block, fuel-injected, overhead-cam V-6 into production until 2004&quot;.

Cumberford described the Roadster as &quot;a signpost to the many wrong turns that led to the bankruptcy of what was in 1955 the largest business entity in the entire world (GM)&quot;.

There was nostalgia for the LaSalle name, and at various points in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, General Motors issued Motorama cars and proposed new consumer automobiles under the name. The year 1955 saw two Motorama concept cars, the LaSalle II four-door hardtop and the LaSalle II Roadster. Ordered to be destroyed, both the four-door hardtop and the roadster were shipped to the Warhoops Salvage Yard in Sterling Heights, Michigan; instead of being destroyed they were hidden in a corner of the facility.

In 1990, collector Joe Bortz purchased and restored the Roadster, which was featured in a 2013 article in Automobile (magazine), for which the author, Robert Cumberford won the 2013 &quot;Best Article of the Year Award&quot; from the Motor Press Guild for his Automobile magazine article, &quot;GM&#x27;s Road Not Taken&quot; about the &quot;La Salle II Roadster&quot;.

The LaSalle name was raised again when Cadillac was developing a new small luxury sedan, but it was passed over in favor of Cadillac Seville. Early mockups of what was to become the 1963 Buick Riviera were badged &quot;LaSalle II,&quot; as the Cadillac division was being considered for production of this successful personal luxury car.

== LaSalle in media ==

For media outlets, when referring to the cars in visual or print media reporting the proper nomenclature is to identify them &quot;LaSalle&quot; as they are a separate marque, and are registered under the &quot;Make&quot; name of LaSalle on automobile titles. While built by the Cadillac Division of General Motors, they are not a subordinate model under the Cadillac brand, thus, to call them &quot;Cadillac LaSalle&quot; is improper. 

Eddie Murphy’s character bails out of a 1939 coupe during a car chase in the movie Harlem Nights.

In the 1967 film &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;, gangster Mike Heitler (played by Leo Gordon) buys a used LaSalle for $750 (equivalent to about $12,000 in 2021), to be disguised as a Chicago police car for use in the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

In the 1970s television show &quot;All in the Family&quot;, Archie and Edith Bunker sing, &quot;Gee, our old LaSalle ran great&quot; in the program&#x27;s opening theme song, &quot;Those Were the Days.&quot; Many could not understand the now-obscure reference, and the opening was re-recorded in future seasons with the word ‘LaSalle’ enunciated a little more clearly.

In Season One, episode 21 of &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, Lew Ayres mentions the hubcap he finds as being from a 1934 LaSalle.

This is the car that the character Marcus Brody drives when he visits Indiana Jones in the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981).

W.E.B. Griffin’s WW2 novel &quot;Semper Fi &quot; includes a detailed subplot about a young marine’s cunning scheme to purchase a nearly-new LeSalle from an unscrupulous car dealer.

<text>A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance. Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly emerging market; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.&#x27;

Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are &quot;unincorporated&quot; joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are &quot;co-venturers&quot;.

A joint venture can take the form of a business. It can also take the form of a project or asset JV, created for the purpose of pursuing one specific project, as an &quot;industry utility&quot; that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants, or may be created for the purpose of defining standards industry standards.

== Terminology ==
In European law, the term &quot;joint venture&quot; is an exclusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of company law. In France, the term &quot;joint venture&quot; is variously translated as &quot; &quot;association d&#x27;entreprises&quot;, &quot;entreprise conjointe&quot;, &quot;coentreprise&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;entreprise commune&quot;.&quot;

== Process ==
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

* Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
* Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
* Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
* Together with public capital and/or bank debt

== Formation ==

In the UK, India, and in many common law countries, a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file its memorandum of association with the appropriate authority. This is a statutory document which informs the public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. Together with the articles of association, it forms the &quot;constitution&quot; of a company in these countries.

The articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000 or so pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions, special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the directors&#x27; decision to bear.

By its formation, the JV becomes a new entity with the implications that:
* it is officially separate from its founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
* it has separate legal liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
* the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies)
* it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

=== Shareholders&#x27; agreement ===
The agreement between the members of a joint venture may be called a Memorandum of Understanding. It is created in association with other activities necessary to form the JV.

Some of the issues that may be addressed by members of a JV in a shareholders&#x27; agreement are:

* Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and, say, the real estate of the other
* The control of the company either by the number of directors or its &quot;funding&quot;
* The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
* Management decisions – whether the board manages or a &quot;founder&quot;
* Transferability of shares – assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
* Dividend policy – percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
* Winding up – the conditions, notice to members
* Confidentiality of know-how and founders&#x27; agreement and penalties for disclosure
* First right of refusal – purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders&#x27; agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.

The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/proxy); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.

Often, JVs are created as 50:50 partnerships with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at board meetings.

=== Dissolution ===
A JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

* Aims of original venture met
* Aims of original venture not met
* Either or both parties develop new goals
* Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
* Time agreed for joint venture has expired
* Legal or financial issues
* Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
* One party acquires the other

== Risks ==
Joint ventures are risky forms of business partnerships. Literature in business and management has paid attention to different factors of conflict and opportunism in joint ventures, in particular the influence of parent control structure, ownership change, and volatile environment.

== Supplying to government ==
Government procurement regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in the United States, may specify how joint ventures are to be approached as suppliers or confirm that a joint venture or other form of contractor partnering is seen as a &quot;desirable&quot; arrangement for supplying to government. The FAR states that Under the rules applicable to public procurement in the European Union, public bodies may insist that suppliers intending to provide goods and services through a joint partnership accept joint liability for the execution of the contract.

== Worldwide ==
=== China ===
According to a 2003 report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world&#x27;s largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the US. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises. The US had 45,000 projects by 2004 with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.

Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001. The corpus of the law has improved since then.

Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.

Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment. Those five categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.

==== Equity joint ventures ====
The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability. Prior to China&#x27;s entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses, and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture&#x27;s registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.

The JV contract accompanied by the articles of association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence. These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report. There are also the ancillary documents (termed &quot;offsets&quot; in the US) covering know-how and trademarks and supply-of-equipment agreements.

The minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated,
where the foreign equity and debt levels are:
* Less than US$3 million, equity must constitute 70% of the investment;
* Between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
* Between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
* More than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.

The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.

==== Cooperative joint ventures ==== 

Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs) are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures. Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.

The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions – the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.

The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.

Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

* A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
* The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, &quot;not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution&quot;. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
* It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
* A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.
* During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
* Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV&#x27;s articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.

With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start. A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner&#x27;s business license, under a contractual arrangement. However, under the CJV, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.

There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV&#x27;s life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.

The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above. It is a non-binding document – the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study (submissions by the Chinese partner).

==== Wholly foreign-owned enterprises (WFOEs) ====
There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China&#x27;s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.

To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its &quot;Catalogs Investments&quot; (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.

The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.

WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.

WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises. Like with EJVs, but the liability of the directors, managers, advisers, and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.

An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its know-how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.
As of the 3rd Quarter of 2004, WFOEs had replaced EJVs and CJVs as follows:
(*)=Financial Vventures by EJVs/CJVs
(**)=Approved JVs

==== Foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS) ====
These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the number of shares purchased by each partner.

The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types &quot;A&quot; and Type &quot;B&quot; shares.

Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type &quot;B&quot; shares are denominated in Renminbi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in &quot;H&quot; share and in NYSE exchanges.

&quot;A&quot; shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. &quot;B&quot; shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade &quot;B&quot; shares.

==== Investment companies by foreign investors (ICFI) ====
Investment companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.

The total amount of the investor&#x27;s assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US$400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor&#x27;s intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV.

On March 15, 2019, China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress adopted a unified Foreign Investment Law, which comes into effect on January 1, 2020.

=== India ===
JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

* The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
* Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
* Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit) are allowed in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.

Through capital market operations, foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.

The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&amp;As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.

Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.

It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts. Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.

=== Ukraine ===
In Ukraine, most of joint ventures are operated in the form of Limited liability company, as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign investors is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine &quot;On Foreign Investment&quot;. In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement Under the Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of oil and gas production.

== Public perception ==
According to Gerard Baynham of Water Street Partners, there has been much negative press about joint ventures, but objective data indicate that they may actually outperform wholly owned and controlled affiliates. He writes, &quot;A different narrative emerged from our recent analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) data, collected from more than 20,000 entities. According to the DOC data, foreign joint ventures of U.S. companies realized a 5.5 percent average return on assets (ROA), while those companies&#x27; wholly owned and controlled affiliates (the vast majority of which are wholly owned) realized a slightly lower 5.2 percent ROA. The same story holds true for investments by foreign companies in the U.S., but the difference is more pronounced. U.S.-based joint ventures realized a 2.2 percent average ROA, while wholly owned and controlled affiliates in the U.S. only realized a 0.7 percent ROA.&quot;

<doc id="538787" wikidata="Q2393095" url="?curid=538787" title="Oʼodham language">
<text>Oʼodham (, ) or Papago-Pima is a Uto-Aztecan language of southern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico, where the Tohono Oʼodham (formerly called the Papago) and Akimel Oʼodham (traditionally called Pima) reside. In 2000 there were estimated to be approximately 9,750 speakers in the United States and Mexico combined, although there may be more due to underreporting.

It is the 10th most-spoken indigenous language in the United States, the 3rd most-spoken indigenous language in Arizona after Western Apache and Navajo. It is the third-most spoken language in Pinal County, Arizona, and the fourth-most spoken language in Pima County, Arizona.

Approximately 8% of Oʼodham speakers in the US speak English &quot;not well&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot;, according to results of the 2000 Census. Approximately 13% of Oʼodham speakers in the US were between the ages of 5 and 17, and among the younger Oʼodham speakers, approximately 4% were reported as speaking English &quot;not well&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot;.

Native names for the language, depending on the dialect and orthography, include , , and .

==Dialects==
The Oʼodham language has a number of dialects.
* Oʼodham
** Tohono Oʼodham
*** Cukuḍ Kuk
*** Gigimai
*** Huhuʼula (Huhuwoṣ)
*** Totoguanh
** Akimel Oʼodham
*** Eastern Gila
*** Kohadk
*** Salt River
*** Western Gila
** Hia C-ed Oʼodham


Due to the paucity of data on the linguistic varieties of the Hia C-eḍ Oʼodham, this section currently focuses on the Tohono Oʼodham and Akimel Oʼodham dialects only.

The greatest lexical and grammatical dialectal differences are between the Tohono Oʼodham (or Papago) and the Akimel Oʼodham (or Pima) dialect groupings. Some examples:

There are other major dialectal differences between northern and southern dialects, for example:

The Cukuḍ Kuk dialect has null in certain positions where other Tohono Oʼodham dialects have a bilabial:

==Morphology==
Oʼodham is an agglutinative language, where words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several morphemes strung together.

==Phonology==
Oʼodham phonology has a typical Uto-Aztecan inventory distinguishing 19 consonants and 5 vowels.

===Consonants===

The retroflex consonants are apical postalveolar.

===Vowels===

Most vowels distinguish two degrees of length: long and short, and some vowels also show extra-short duration (voicelessness).

* &quot;Seri&quot;
* &quot;permission&quot;
* &quot;you&quot;
* &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, &quot;who knows?&quot;

Papago is pronounced in Pima.

Additionally, in common with many northern Uto-Aztecan languages, vowels and nasals at end of words are devoiced. Also, a short schwa sound, either voiced or unvoiced depending on position, is often interpolated between consonants and at the ends of words.

===Allophony and distribution===

* Extra short is realized as voiceless and devoices preceding obstruents: → &quot;jackrabbit&quot;.
* is a fricative before unrounded vowels: .
* appears before and in Spanish loanwords, but native words do not have nasal assimilation: &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;meet&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot;. , , and rarely occur initially in native words, and does not occur before .
* and are largely in complementary distribution, appearing before high vowels , appearing before low vowels : &quot;sing&quot;. They contrast finally ( (1st imperfective auxiliary) vs. &quot;next to speaker&quot;), though Saxton analyzes these as and , respectively, and final as in as . However, there are several Spanish loanwords where occurs: &quot;number&quot;. Similarly, for the most part and appear before low vowels while and before high vowels, but there are exceptions to both, often in Spanish loanwords: &quot;wine&quot;, TO weco / AO veco (&quot;[de]bajo&quot;) &quot;under&quot;.

==Orthography==

There are two orthographies commonly used for the Oʼodham language: Alvarez–Hale and Saxton. The Alvarez–Hale orthography is officially used by the Tohono Oʼodham Nation and the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community, and is used in this article, but the Saxton orthography is also common and is official in the Gila River Indian Community. It is relatively easy to convert between the two, the differences between them being largely no more than different graphemes for the same phoneme, but there are distinctions made by Alvarez–Hale not made by Saxton.

The Saxton orthography does not mark word-initial or extra-short vowels. Final generally corresponds to Hale–Alvarez and final to Hale–Alvarez :

* Hale–Alvarez vs. Saxton &quot;cottontail rabbit&quot;
* Hale–Alvarez vs. Saxton &quot;I&quot;

===Disputed spellings===

There is some disagreement among speakers as to whether the spelling of words should be only phonetic or whether etymological principles should be considered as well.

For instance, vs. (&quot;frybread&quot;; the spellings and are also seen) derives from (a warm color roughly equivalent to yellow or brown). Some believe it should be spelled phonetically as , reflecting the fact that it begins with , while others think its spelling should reflect the fact that it is derived from ( is itself a form of , so while it could be spelled , it is not since it is just a different declension of the same word).

==Grammar==

===Syntax===

Oʼodham has relatively free word order within clauses; for example, all of the following sentences mean &quot;the boy brands the pig&quot;:
* 
* 
* 

In principle, these could also mean &quot;the pig brands the boy&quot;, but such an interpretation would require an unusual context.

Despite the general freedom of sentence word order, Oʼodham is fairly strictly verb-second in its placement of the auxiliary verb (in the above sentences, it is ):

* &quot;I am working&quot;
* but &quot;I am not working&quot;, not **&quot;pi cipkan ʼañ&quot;

===Verbs===
Verbs are inflected for aspect (imperfective , perfective ), tense (future imperfective ), and number (plural ). Number agreement displays absolutive behavior: verbs agree with the number of the subject in intransitive sentences, but with that of the object in transitive sentences:

* &quot;the boy is working&quot;
* &quot;the boys are working&quot;
* &quot;the boy is branding the pig&quot;
* &quot;the boys are branding the pig&quot;
* &quot;the boy is branding the pigs&quot;

The main verb agrees with the object for person ( in the above example), but the auxiliary agrees with the subject: &quot;I am branding the pigs&quot;.

===Nouns===
Three numbers are distinguished in nouns: singular, plural, and distributive, though not all nouns have distinct forms for each. Most distinct plurals are formed by reduplication and often vowel loss plus other occasional morphophonemic changes, and distributives are formed from these by gemination of the reduplicated consonant:

* &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;dogs&quot;, &quot;dogs (all over)&quot;
* &quot;car&quot;, &quot;cars&quot;, &quot;cars (all over)&quot;
* &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;cats&quot;

===Adjectives===
Oʼodham adjectives can act both attributively modifying nouns and predicatively as verbs, with no change in form.

* &quot;This water is cold&quot;
* &quot;I like cold water&quot;

==Sample text==
The following is an excerpt from Oʼodham Piipaash Language Program: (&quot;Roadrunner&quot;). It exemplifies the Salt River dialect.

In Saxton orthography:


The following is a song from O&#x27;odham Hoho&#x27;ok A&#x27;agida (O&#x27;odham Legends and Lore) by Susanne Ignacio Enos, and Dean and Lucille Saxton. It exemplifies the &quot;Storyteller dialect&quot;.

<text>Danny Tamberelli (born February 8, 1982) is an American actor and musician. He is known for his portrayal of Little Pete Wrigley in &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; from 1989 to 1995 and for his work as a cast member of the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot; from 1997 to 2000. He is also known for his portrayal of Jimmy De Santa in the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Tamberelli was raised in Maywood, New Jersey and moved to Wyckoff, New Jersey, where he attended Ramapo High School, graduating in 2000. Tamberelli is a graduate of Hampshire College, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in interdisciplinary arts focusing on music performance and booking management.

==Career==
Tamberelli&#x27;s first performance was in a Huggies commercial, according to a 1994 interview. His first regular television role, at age 4, was as Sean Novak on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. He originally appeared from 1986 to 1987, when his character, along with his on-screen parents, were written off the show. However, he returned to the role in the fall of 1988 when the Novak family was brought back, to help close up storylines in preparation for the &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; finale in January 1989.

Afterwards, Tamberelli played Jackie Rodowsky on the television series &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot;. It was around this time that he was cast as Little Pete Wrigley on &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, which first began as a series of 60-second shorts on Nickelodeon in 1989. After progressing to a batch of specials, &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; became a regular half-hour sitcom in 1993, and brought Tamberelli more recognition. During his time in the show, he met the musicians Iggy Pop and Mark Mulcahy, who inspired him to become a musician too; Iggy would teach him how to play the song &quot;T.V. Eye&quot; (from The Stooges&#x27; album &quot;Fun House&quot;) on bass in between breaks, when Tamberelli was 11. Around that time he provided the voice for Arnold in &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;, as well as appearing in the films &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;. He was also on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;All That&quot; from 1997 to 2000 and &quot;Figure It Out&quot; from 1997 to 1999, and guest starred in the &quot;Space Cases&quot; episode &quot;All You Can Eaty&quot;. In the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, he provided the voice and physical inspiration for Jimmy Townley/Jimmy De Santa.
Tamberelli is the bassist and vocalist for the rock band Jounce, formed in Northern New Jersey. They started in the early 2000s as a jazz funk quartet, but their sound later evolved into &quot;90s music-inspired post-punk&quot;. They released an eponymous debut album on July 18, 2006, followed by their sophomore effort, &quot;These Things&quot; on March 31, 2009. The EP titled &quot;Meet Me in the Middle&quot; was released digitally on April 4, 2011. As of 2016, the only remaining members from the original formation were Tamberelli and childhood friend and guitarist Matt DeSteno. Tamberelli was also the bassist for the folk/pop band Every Good Boy.

In 2013, he started a podcast with former &quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot; co-star Michael C. Maronna. He is also a founding member of the sketch comedy group Manboobs, along with Jeremy Balon. In May 2024, he and his wife Kate Tamberelli published their book &quot;The Road Trip Rewind&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tamberelli married author Katelyn Detweiler in early 2018. In 2019, they had a son, and in 2022, they had a daughter.

<doc id="538806" wikidata="Q768727" url="?curid=538806" title="Necrophobia">
<text>Necrophobia is a specific phobia, the irrational fear of dead organisms (e.g., corpses) as well as things associated with death (e.g., coffins, tombstones, funerals, cemeteries). With all types of emotions, obsession with death becomes evident in both fascination and objectification. In a cultural sense, necrophobia may also be used to mean a fear of the dead by a cultural group, e.g., a belief that the spirits of the dead will return to haunt the living.

The sufferer may experience this sensation all the time, or when something triggers the fear, like a close encounter with a dead animal or the funeral of a loved one or friend. The word &quot;necrophobia&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;nekros&quot; () for &quot;corpse&quot; and the Greek &quot;phobos&quot; () for &quot;fear&quot;.

== Causes ==
Necrophobia can have a variety of causes, many of which are still being researched. Many cases of Necrophobia are caused by a traumatic incident, such as a close loved one or pet dying, or encountering a dead body. It has also been found that phobias result from a cultural, or learned response, meaning that an adult&#x27;s anxiety, paranoia, and fear can be taught to a child that is observing it. That being said, some children can be more prone to anxiety and things of that sort through their genetics.

Another being influence can be the type of media that an individual is consuming. Movies and books from the Horror genre tend to generate a lot of fear around the dead. Researcher Matthew Hudson points out that &quot;our brains are continuously anticipating and preparing us for action in response to threat, and horror movies exploit this expertly to enhance our excitement.&quot; Although this is meant to be inducing feeling of excitement, it can harbor emotions of fear. In addition to this, unresolved stress tends to invoke &#x27;defensive and escaping behavior&#x27; and can be a contributing factor in necrophobia.

== Symptoms ==
When experiencing effects from necrophobia, symptoms can vary for each individual. Some people can experience physical symptoms caused by triggers (e.g. encountering a dead body/animal, portrayal of death, etc.). These symptoms can include:

* Dizziness or lightheadedness 
* Choking sensations 
* Shortness of breath 
* Sweaty palms 
* Racing heart 
* Prickly sensations like pins and needles 
* Excessive sweating 
* Tightness in chest 
* Hot and cold flashes 
* Trembling or shaking 

* Numbness

As well as some psychological symptoms, such as:

* An intense feeling of fear and discomfort 
* Feeling of losing control or fainting
* Fear of dying 
* Inability to distinguish reality 
* Feeling of detachment from one’s body 
* An urge to escape or avoid the situation

== Origin ==
Necrophobia&#x27;s known origins stem from Ancient Greek culture and have been present since the Neolithic period. At this time, it was a believed fear that the dead would arise in a state that was &quot;neither living or dead, but rather &#x27;undead.&#x27;&quot; They believed that the purpose for this was to harm the living. Because of this fear, many or corpses have been uncovered with stones and amphora fragments placed on them. This was done as a way to pin down the body as a means of ensuring that it will not rise.

The fear that the dead will rejoin the living seemingly connect to their belief in the body and soul separating at death, implying that the soul lives on in another form (e.g., reincarnation, afterlife, etc.). This belief lead people to think that the soul can also be reconnected to the body, or that another spirit could take its place. 

== Treatment ==
Although there are no known ways to prevent or cure Necrophobia, there are several treatment options that can help people that people that experienced it. Many treatments involve psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, and Exposure Therapy. Exposure therapy has actually been found to be the most effective at treating this disorder through desensitization. Medication can also be prescribed to treat this phobia. The antibiotic D-cycloserine is believed to facilitate fear extinction, and can be administered to treat specific phobias.

There are also ways to help yourself cope with phobias as well. These include:

* Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, etc. 
* Confide in a trusted person about your feelings. 
* Join a support group to share and learn from the experiences of others. 
* Try adopting mindfulness. 
* Don’t isolate yourself as that can lead to further complications.

<text>Leslie Eleazer Orgel FRS (12 January 1927 – 27 October 2007) was a British chemist and member of the National Academy of Sciences, known for his theories on the origin of life.

==Biography==

Leslie Orgel was born in London on . He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry with first-class honours from the University of Oxford in 1948. In 1951 he was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford and in 1953 was awarded his PhD in chemistry.

Orgel started his career as a theoretical inorganic chemist and continued his studies in this field at Oxford, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Chicago.

Together with Sydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, and Beryl M. Oughton he was one of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Francis Crick and James Watson, at the time he and the other scientists were working at Oxford University&#x27;s Chemistry Department. According to the late Dr. Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner who subsequently worked with Crick; Orgel himself also worked with Crick at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

In 1955 he joined the chemistry department at Cambridge University. There he did work in transition metal chemistry and ligand field theory, published several peer-reviewed journal articles, and wrote a textbook entitled &quot;Transition Metal Chemistry: Ligand Field Theory&quot; (1960). He developed the Orgel diagram showing the energies of electronic terms in transition metal complexes.

Orgel formulated his protein-translation error-catastrophe theory of aging in 1963, (prior to the use of the term by Manfred Eigen for mutational error catastrophe) which has since been experimentally challenged.

In 1964, Orgel was appointed senior fellow and research professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, where he directed the Chemical Evolution Laboratory. He was also an adjunct professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego, and he was one of five principal investigators in the NASA-sponsored NSCORT program in exobiology. Orgel also participated in NASA&#x27;s Viking Mars Lander Program as a member of the Molecular Analysis Team that designed the gas chromatography mass spectrometer instrument that robots took to the planet Mars.

Orgel&#x27;s lab came across an economical way to make cytarabine, a compound that is one of today&#x27;s most commonly used anti-cancer agents.

Together with Stanley Miller, Orgel also suggested that peptide nucleic acids – rather than ribonucleic acids – constituted the first pre-biotic systems capable of self-replication on early Earth.

His name is popularly known because of Orgel&#x27;s rules, credited to him, particularly Orgel&#x27;s Second Rule: &quot;Evolution is cleverer than you are.&quot;

In his book &quot;The Origins of Life&quot;, Orgel coined the concept of specified complexity, to describe the criterion by which living organisms are distinguished from non-living matter. He published over three hundred articles in his research areas.

In 1993, Orgel presented at the &quot;What is Life?&quot; Conference at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland along with many other prominent scientists exploring the origin of life research such as Manfred Eigen, John Maynard Smith and Stephen Jay Gould. Orgel&#x27;s talk was on &quot;Molecular Structure and Disordered Crystals.&quot;

Orgel died of pancreatic cancer on 27 October 2007 at the San Diego Hospice &amp; Palliative Care in San Diego, California.

== Research on the origin of life==

=== Nucleobase synthesis ===
Orgel proposed a novel solution to a problem with Juan Oro&#x27;s proposed mechanism of nucleobase synthesis on the early Earth, which relied on the reaction of five molecules of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to form adenine. The problem with this was that it would require much more concentrated hydrogen cyanide than evidence suggested was present.

Orgel suggested that the hydrogen cyanide was frozen in solution. This would concentrate HCN molecules in the spaces in between the crystal lattice of ice, and also solve the problem of HCN being too volatile in a liquid water solution.

=== Nucleoside formation ===
For nucleoside (nucleobase + ribose sugar) synthesis, Orgel suggested an almost opposite approach, heating a mixture of ribose and the purine nucleobases hypoxanthine, adenine, and guanine to dryness in the presence of magnesium ions. This reaction puts the glycosidic bond in the correct position in two ways: the nucleobase attaches to the correct carbon on ribose, and in the correct orientation (the beta anomer).

However, the synthesis was later criticised because it only worked most with hypoxanthine, a nucleobase that is not relevant to current life on Earth, and because it was not specific for the ribose sugar and could instead be applied to other sugars.

=== RNA polymerization ===
Continuing his work studying the prebiotic synthesis of RNA, Orgel explored mechanisms by which inorganic phosphate and nucleotide phosphoryl groups could be chemically activated for condensation into nucleic acid polymers. Starting in the 1960s, Orgel explored a variety of cyanide-based activating agents which could have plausibly been present on a young earth. A carbodiimide reagent was found to be effective at activating nucleotide phosphoryl groups and promoting the formation of short Adenosine dimers and trimers. In 2018, John D. Sutherland and co-workers proposed that methyl isocyanide and acetaldehyde could combine to form a pre-biotic phosphate activating agent which could plausibly have formed under early-earth conditions.

Orgel also theorised that one single strand of RNA could have been the template for the first life on Earth and that these imidazole-activated nucleotides could have used this RNA template strand to polymerise and replicate. Lohrmann and Orgel reported that the phosphorimidazolide derivative of adenosine monophosphate (in which a phosphoryl group oxygen is substituted by an imidazole ring) forms short adenosine oligomers in the presence of poly-uridine templates. They further discovered that the divalent metal cation used to catalyze the reaction influenced the regiochemistry of the inter-nucleotide linkage. Pb2+ gave primarily 5’-2’ linked nucleotides while Zn2+ gave primarily 5’-3’ linked nucleotides from guanosine phosphorimidazolides in the presence of a poly-cytidine template. Montmorillonite clay was also shown to promote the polymerization of adenosine phosphorimidazolide into oligonucleotides tens of bases in length starting from a poly-adenosine 10-mer primer. In the absence of montmorillonite, the primer was capped through the formation of a 5’ adenosine pyrophosphate.

The oligonucleotide products in early studies were typically characterized through a combination of 14C radiolabeling, gel electrophoresis, and paper electrophoresis. Enzymatic digestion was used to differentiate regioisomers. The advent of HPLC allowed the characterization of long oligomers of guanosine.

=== Directed panspermia ===
Though he later downplayed the hypothesis, Orgel, along with Francis Crick, proposed a detailed panspermia scenario for the origin of life on Earth, going so far as to suggest that life on Earth was designed by an alien species and sent to Earth. They proposed a design for the spaceship that aliens could have used to seed life on Earth.

=== RNA world ===
In the late 1960s, Orgel proposed that life was based on RNA before it was based on DNA or proteins. His theory included genes based on RNA and RNA enzymes. This view would be developed and shaped into the now widely accepted RNA world hypothesis.

Almost thirty years later, Orgel wrote a lengthy review of the RNA World hypothesis. This review highlighted many proposed syntheses for RNA and its parts in abiotic conditions, noted the significance of the discovery of ribozymes (RNA molecules that function as enzymes just as Orgel had once predicted) and at the same time, demonstrated nucleic acid polymers with alternatives to ribose such as threose nucleic acid (TNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA).

In conclusion, Orgel wrote, &quot;One must recognize that, despite considerable progress, the problem of the origin of the RNA World is far from being solved.&quot;

<text>Fred Clifford Clarke (October 3, 1872 – August 14, 1960) was an American Major League Baseball player from 1894 to and manager from 1897 to 1915. Clarke played for and managed both the Louisville Colonels and Pittsburgh Pirates. He was a left fielder and left-handed batter.

Of the nine pennants in Pittsburgh franchise history, Clarke was the player-manager for four of them. He and fellow Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Vic Willis led Pittsburgh to a victory over Ty Cobb and the Detroit Tigers in the 1909 World Series. Clarke batted over .300 in 11 different seasons. His 35-game hitting streak in 1895 was the second-longest in Major League history at the time. For six years, Clarke held the Major League record for wins by a manager. In 1945, Clarke was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life and career==
Fred Clarke was born on a farm near Winterset, Iowa. At age two, his family moved as part of a covered wagon caravan from Iowa to Kansas before relocating to Des Moines, Iowa, five years later. As a child in Des Moines, Clarke sold newspapers for the Iowa State Register where his boss was future Baseball Hall of Fame member, Ed Barrow. In 1892, a professional team in Hastings, Nebraska sent a railroad ticket to Des Moines semiprofessional player Byron McKibbon, but McKibbon backed out and gave the ticket to Clarke instead. Clarke impressed the Hastings team and he signed his first professional contract. He was in the Southern League at age 21 and played for teams in Montgomery, Alabama, and Savannah, Georgia.

Clarke was discovered in the minor leagues by Louisville part-owner, Barney Dreyfuss, and joined the Colonels in 1894. In his first game, he collected five hits in five at bats which is still a Major League record. In his second season, he asserted himself with a batting average of .347, 191 hits and 96 runs, which were all best on the team by far. In 1897, Clarke took over managerial duties while only 24 years old. As a player, he hit a career-high .390. Only the best average of Willie Keeler&#x27;s career stopped Clarke from winning his only batting title. (For many years, Clarke&#x27;s 1897 average was listed as .406, but further research led most official sources, including MLB.com, to list it at .390.) Despite Clarke&#x27;s excellent hitting and the presence of fellow Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Rube Waddell, the team struggled for several years. While in Louisville, Clarke was teamed up with pitcher Chick Fraser. Clarke and Fraser became brothers-in-law when they married sisters. When the Colonels folded, Barney Dreyfuss became the owner of the Pittsburgh franchise and tapped Clarke, Wagner, Waddell, Deacon Phillippe, and others to accompany him.

==Pittsburgh==

In 1900, Clarke joined the Pittsburgh Pirates as a player and manager, roles he would embrace until his retirement in 1915. was arguably the best hitting season of Clarke&#x27;s career as he led the Major Leagues in slugging average and OPS and led the National League in doubles. He finished second only to his teammate, Honus Wagner, for the National League batting title. In the first World Series, Clarke hit .265 but Boston&#x27;s Cy Young and Bill Dinneen outpitched Pittsburgh overall and won the series in eight games.

In the 1909 World Series, Clarke batted only .211 but hit both of Pittsburgh&#x27;s home runs and had more home runs and RBI than any player on either team. Clarke also set a record for most walks for one player in a World Series game with four in Game 7.

On August 23, 1910, Clarke recorded four assists from the outfield in one game, tying a Major League record. The following season, his last as a regular player, 38-year-old Clarke made 10 putouts in left field in one game on April 25, 1911. Clarke played just 12 more games after 1911, the last three as the oldest active player in the majors.

Clarke finished his career with a .312 batting average and is seventh on the all-time triples list with 220. He led his team to four National League pennants (1901, 1902, 1903 and 1909) and one World Series championship (1909). The 1902 Pirates lost only 36 games under Clarke&#x27;s guidance, tying a modern-era record. In , Clarke passed Cap Anson and Frank Selee, giving him the Major League record for wins by a manager. Clarke&#x27;s record, in turn, was broken by John McGraw in . In addition to the four pennants and one World Series, Clarke managed Pittsburgh to five second-place seasons, three third-place seasons, and two 100-win seasons.

==After his playing days==
After his managing days ended in 1915, Clarke returned to his &quot;Little Pirate Ranch&quot; near Winfield, Kansas, which he had purchased with a down payment during his first year in the majors. He made a considerable fortune when oil was discovered on his property. In 1924, he bought a minority stake in the Pirates and was named the team&#x27;s vice president. He was also allowed to sit in the dugout during games, making him manager Bill McKechnie&#x27;s bench coach in all but name. The Pirates won the World Series the following year.

During the 1926 season, several players felt that Clarke was trying to undermine McKechnie and become manager once again. When slumping veteran (and eventual Hall of Famer) Max Carey got word that Clarke tried to pressure McKechnie into benching him, Carey demanded that Clarke be removed from the bench. He was supported by Babe Adams, the only player on the 1909 world champions still on the team, as well as another veteran, Carson Bigbee. McKechnie initially appeared to side with Carey, Adams and Bigbee, but was forced to recant rather than risk appearing to criticize the front office. A resolution calling for Clarke&#x27;s removal from the bench only garnered the support of three other players. Ownership struck fast and hard; on August 13, the Pirates released Adams and Bigbee, and waived Carey. They finished 84–69, third in the league behind the St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds, and McKechnie lost his job.

Fred Clarke was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as one of the first to be elected by the Old-Timers Committee. He was one of 24 original inductees into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 1951. Clarke remained active and seemingly indestructible into his 70s. In 1947, while fishing in northern Minnesota, he and his wife were thrown into icy northern Minnesota waters by a storm, but he was back out fishing the next day. Soon after, he was nearly shot accidentally while quail hunting. He then survived a gas furnace explosion in his basement. While in Winfield he started the Winfield Country Club that is still in operation to this day. Fred Clarke died in Winfield at age 87.

<text>The Tasmanian temperate rain forests are a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion in western Tasmania. The ecoregion is part of the Australasian realm, which includes Tasmania and Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and adjacent islands.

Rainforest communities in Australia are classified as closed forests in which the canopy comprises 70–100% cover. It can be divided into tropical, subtropical, monsoon and temperate rainforest. Tasmanian rainforest is classified and as cool temperate rainforest, and represents the most floristically complex and best developed form of this forest type in Australia. In Tasmania, they can be found in the West, Savage River National Park, South West, North East and in patches on the East Coast. On the mainland of Australia, cool temperate rainforest have a wide variety of woodland trees, but Tasmania only has a limited number of woodland and vascular plants such as mosses, liverworts, lichen and fungi. Because of this, the definition of Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest was redefined in the 1980s to allow for communities that did not meet the canopy requirements and clearly separate cool temperate rainforest from mixed forest; The current definition states that cool temperate rainforests are those with trees usually greater than in height and capable of regenerating in the absence of large scale catastrophic events, such as fire. These forests are climax vegetation and are dominated by angiosperms such as &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot; (myrtle beech), &quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot; (sassafras), and &quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot; (leatherwood) as well as gymnosperms such as &quot;Athrotaxis selaginoides&quot; (King Billy Pine), &quot;Lagarostrobos franklinii&quot; (huon or macquarie pine) and &quot;Phyllocladus aspleniifolius&quot; (celery-top pine). The limited number of woody species is thought to be due to repeated glaciation.

Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest can be divided into four types: Callidendrous rainforest, Thamnic rainforest, Implicate rainforest and Open Montane. These four major types differ in many of their characteristics such as structure, floristics, distribution, level of endemism and ecology.

==Community composition and descriptions==
The Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest is composed of two alliances, the myrtle-beech &quot;(Nothofagus cunninghamii)&quot; alliance and the pencil pine (&quot;Athrotaxis cupressoides&quot;) alliance. The former is made up of callidendrous, thamnic and implicate, whilst the latter is all open montane.

===Callidendrous rainforest===

This is the simplest rainforest community in Tasmania; it is typically represented by medium to tall forests dominated by &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot; and/or &quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot;, often together with &quot;Leptospermum lanigerum&quot; (woolly tea-tree) or &quot;Acacia melanoxylon&quot; (Australian blackwood). Typically, these forests are at least in height. Trees are usually well formed and widely spaced, and the understorey is open and often described as park-like. The diversity of woody species is low, and they are usually sparse and inconspicuous throughout the understorey. However, at mid to low elevations, the understorey may contain a few small trees or shrubs such as &quot;Olearia argophylla&quot; (musktree), &quot;Pimelea drupacea&quot; (cherry riceflower), &quot;Pittosporum bicolor&quot; (cheesewood), &quot;Aristotelia peduncularis&quot; (heart berry) and &quot;Coprosma quadrifida&quot;.

Fern diversity is high in many areas, and in these areas, epiphytes often flourish. The dominant tree ferns are commonly &quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot; (soft tree fern) and/or &quot;Polystichum poliferum&quot; (mother shield fern). Common epiphyte species include &quot;Rumohra adiantiformis&quot; (leathery shieldfern or iron fern), &quot;Asplenium gracillimum&quot; (mother spleenwort), &quot;Asplenium terrestre&quot;, &quot;Microsorum diversifolium&quot; (kangaroo fern)&quot;,&quot; Hymenophyllum flabellatum&quot; (shiny filmy-fern), &quot;Hymenophyllum australe&quot; (austral filmy-fern), &quot;Hymenophyllum cupressiforme&quot;, and &quot;Polyphlebium venosum&quot; (veined bristle-fern). &quot;Histiopteris incisa&quot; (bat&#x27;s wing fern) and &quot;Hypolepis rugosula&quot; (ruddy ground-fern) occur in disturbed sites such as along roads where there have been breaks in the canopy.
As elevation increases, the height of the forest decreases, &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot; becomes multi-stemmed, develops crooked leaning stems and abundant epiphytic bryophytes, and lichens produce a patterned effect on the trunks. The typical understorey becomes dominated by &quot;Tasmannia lanceolata&quot; (mountain pepper) and &quot;Telopea truncata&quot; (Tasmanian waratah), and the ground layer becomes host to &quot;Oxalis megellancia&quot; and &quot;Lagenophora stipitata&quot; (blue bottle-daisy). The pteridophyte diversity decreases and only small species such as &quot;Lycopodium fastigiatum&quot; (alpine club moss),&quot; Hymenophyllum peltatum&quot;, &quot;Grammitis billardierei&quot; (common finger-fern) and &quot;Blechnum penna-marina&quot; (Antarctic hard-fern) persist.

Callidendrous rainforests occurs in the eastern half of the state and in northwestern and central Tasmania.

Table 1 Lyrebird nature walk, Mt Feild, Tasmania: species composition and structure of a mixed Callidendrous and Thamnic rainforest community; Height ~, 90% of ground litter cover, 5% rock and 5% bare ground.

===Thamnic rainforest===

Thamnic rainforests are characterised by well-formed trees of medium height, well below , and a distinct shrub layer. The canopy is typically dominated by a mixture of 2–5 species, including &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot;, &quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot;, &quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot;, &quot;Lagarostrobos franklinii&quot;, &quot;Eucryphia milliganii&quot; (dwarf leatherwood), &quot;Phyllocladus aspleniifolius&quot; (celery-top pine), &quot;Athrotaxis selaginoides&quot; and, rarely, &quot;Nothofagus gunnii&quot; (tanglefoot-beech).

The shrub layer is more prominent and has an increased diversity of woody trees. Common species are: &quot;Anopterus glandulosus&quot; (Tasmanian laurel), &quot;Anodopetalum biglandulosum&quot;, &quot;Acradenia frankliniae&quot; (whitey-wood or wirewood), &quot;Archeria hirtella&quot;, &quot;Archeria eriocarpa&quot;, &quot;Cenarrhenes nitida&quot; (native plum), &quot;Trochocarpa cunninghamii&quot;, &quot;Trochocarpa gunnii&quot; (sweet-scented trochocarpa), &quot;Orites diversifolia&quot; (silkwood), &quot;Prionotes cerinthoides&quot; (climbing heath), &quot;Richea pandanifolia&quot; (pandani or giant grass tree) and, at high elevations, &quot;Richea scoparia&quot; (honey richea). The increase in understorey shrub is due to the larger number of gaps in the canopy, and the differing light requirements of competing species. Fern diversity decreases, as a result, because of the decrease in light from the understorey. &quot;Parablechnum wattsii&quot; (hard water fern) is the main ground fern; it prefers damp shaded areas and forms a very dense layer in some areas but can be absent in others. Small epiphytes are widespread, these include &quot;Hymenophyllum rarum&quot; (a filmy fern) and &quot;Grammitis billardierei&quot;. &quot;Apteropteris applanata&quot; can occur in areas containing Athrotaxis. Other larger epiphytes are usually present, but they are rarely prominent. At higher elevations, the general appearance resembles that of a callidenderous rainforest, but the floristic differences remain the same.

Thamnic rainforests occur mostly in western and southwestern Tasmania.
Table 2: The Creepy Crawly Nature Walk, Mt Field, Tasmania: Species composition in Thamnic rainforest community; Height ~, 95% of ground leaf cover, scattered rock and bare ground.

===Implicate rainforest===
Low in stature, broken uneven canopies, height reduced below 20m. Dominance is usually shared between several species: &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii, Nothofagus gunnii, Eucryphia lucida, Atherosperma moschatum, Lagarostrobos franklinii, Eucryphia milliganii, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, Athrotaxis selaginoides, Diselma archeri, Leptospermum scoparium, Leptospermum glaucescens, Leptospermum nitidum, Leptospermum lanigerum, Acacia mucronata&quot; and &quot;Melaleuca squarrosa&quot;. &quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot; is usually represented by small diameter depauperate plants. Understorey is tangled and barely distinguishable from the canopy layer. It can from a continuous layer from the ground to the canopy but some scattered emergents can occur. Species diversity is high for trees and shrubs in this community, but very low for ferns. &quot;Anopterus glandulosus, Anodopetalum biglandulosum, Cenarrhenes nitida, Telopea truncata, Agastachys odorata, Comprosma nitida, Archeria eriocarpa, Archeria serpyllifolia, Archeria hirtella, Olearia persoonioides, Trochocarpa cunninghamii, Trochocarpa gunnii, Richea pandanifolia, Richea scoparia, Dracophyllum milliganii&quot; and &quot;Prionotes cerinthoides&quot; are all typical shrubs or small trees that comprise these communities. The ferns are dominated by &quot;Parablechnum wattsii&quot; but small epiphytes do prevail: &quot;Hymenophyllum rarum, Hymenophyllum marginatum, Grammitis billardierei and Apteropteris applanata&quot; occurs in communities where &quot;Athrotaxis&quot; are present. – occur mostly in western and southwestern Tasmania.

===Open montane rainforest===
Low and dominated by &quot;Athrotaxis cupressoides&quot; or &quot;Athrotaxis selaginoides&quot; (less commonly). Open canopy, widely spaced trees allow bright light to penetrate the lower levels of the forest. In some communities, the canopy can be dense and instead resemble a high-elevation callidendrous forest. Understorey may be dominated by either &quot;Poa&quot; (grasses) or &quot;Sphagnum&quot; (mosses) or commonly, low shrubs that are less than half the height of the forest. There is a high diversity of woody species but a low diversity of ferns. Multiple species from nearby treeless vegetation are present, but their classification as rainforest species is yet to be confirmed. Understorey shrubs include: &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii, Nothofagus gunnii, Diselma archeri, Podocarpus lawrencei, Richea pandanifolia, Richea scoparia, Richea sprengelioides, Orites acicularis, Orites revoluta, Microstobos niphophilus, Tasmannia lanceolata, Epacris serpyllifolia&quot; and &quot;Baeckea gunniana&quot;. Ferns are usually poorly developed with larger ground species absent or confined to rocks, &quot;Gleichenia alpina&quot; is the exception to this observation. Small species such as &quot;Hymenophyllum peltatum&quot; and &quot;Apteropteris applanata&quot; can sometimes make an appearance. – occur on the Central Plateau but can extend as small outliners to the mountains further south.

==Biological factors==
Geology and soils are important factors in Tasmanian ecology. Callidendrous forests require good-quality sites where fertile soils occur over rocks such as basalt, dolerite and the more nutrient-rich granites. Implicate forests are at the other extreme, and mostly grow in organic soils or mineral soils derived from nutrient-poor rock types such as quartzites and silicous conglomerates. Thamnic forests tend to prefer an intermediate substrate. With the exception of open montane forests, elevation seems to have little effect on the floristic differences between community types.

==Conservation==
In 1982, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the northern portion of the ecoregion a World Heritage Site.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas in the ecoregion include:
* Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park
* Hartz Mountains National Park
* Meredith Range Regional Reserve
* Mount Dundas Regional Reserve
* Narawntapu National Park
* Savage River National Park
* Southwest National Park
* West Coast Range Regional Reserve

<text>Nephology (; from the Greek word &quot;nephos&quot; for &#x27;cloud&#x27;) is the study of clouds and cloud formation. British meteorologist Luke Howard was a major researcher within this field, establishing a cloud classification system.
While this branch of meteorology still exists today, the term nephology, or nephologist is rarely used. The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century, and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth. Recently, interest in nephology has increased as some meteorologists have begun to focus on the relationship between clouds and global warming, which is a source of uncertainty regarding &quot;estimates and interpretations of the Earth&#x27;s changing energy budget.&quot;
* Since the late 1990s, some have suggested that when high solar activity lowers levels of cosmic rays, that in turn reduces cloud cover and warms the planet. Others say that there is no statistical evidence for such an effect. 
Some nephologists believe that an increase in global temperature could decrease the thickness and brightness (ability to reflect light energy), which would further increase global temperature.

Understanding the dynamics of cloud formation is essential, as clouds play a significant role in the Earth&#x27;s energy balance and climate system. Recent research has focused on how changes in cloud cover and characteristics may affect, and be affected by, the Earth&#x27;s changing climate.

== Cloud formation ==
Cloud formation is a complex process that begins with the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. This process typically occurs when moist air rises and cools to its dew point, leading to the formation of water droplets or ice crystals. Several factors influence cloud formation, including atmospheric temperature, humidity, and the presence of aerosols. Cloud types are classified based on their appearance and altitude, with major categories including cirrus, cumulus, and stratus. Understanding these processes is fundamental to studying weather patterns and climate dynamics.

== Cloud formation and climate change ==
The interaction between cloud formation and climate change is an aspect of atmospheric science. Clouds have a dual role in the Earth&#x27;s climate system: they can cool the Earth&#x27;s surface by reflecting incoming solar radiation (albedo effect) and warm it by trapping outgoing infrared radiation (greenhouse effect). The overall impact of clouds on global climate depends on factors such as cloud type, altitude, thickness, and the amount of water or ice they contain.

Thin, high-altitude cirrus clouds tend to have a net warming effect, since they allow incoming solar radiation to pass through while trapping heat radiating from the Earth&#x27;s surface. On the other hand, low-altitude, thick clouds like stratus or cumulus generally reflect more sunlight back into space, contributing to a cooling effect. However, the extent to which different types of clouds contribute to warming or cooling is still an area of ongoing research.

Climate change is expected to impact cloud formation patterns, potentially leading to feedback loops. Warmer temperatures can increase the rate of evaporation, leading to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which could result in more clouds. This increase in cloud cover could have a cooling effect due to increased albedo. However, if the increase is primarily in high-altitude thin clouds, the net effect could be additional warming. Conversely, a decrease in cloudiness in certain regions could lead to further surface warming.

Recent studies also suggest that cloud formation is sensitive to aerosols – tiny particles in the atmosphere. Aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei, around which cloud droplets can form. Changes in aerosol concentrations, due to human activities or natural processes, can therefore influence cloud properties and, consequently, the climate.

Moreover, climate models show varying degrees of sensitivity to cloud feedbacks, contributing to uncertainties in future climate projections. The challenge for scientists is to understand and accurately model the myriad ways clouds interact with atmospheric dynamics, solar radiation, and the Earth&#x27;s surface. This understanding is critical for predicting future climate scenarios and informing global strategies to address climate change.

== Recent research and studies ==
Recent research in nephology has delved into the relationship between cloud formation and climate change. One area of study has been the potential link between solar activity, cosmic rays, and cloud cover. One hypothesis suggests that high solar activity, which reduces cosmic ray flux, might lead to decreased cloud cover, thereby warming the planet. However, this theory remains a subject of debate among scientists. Work has been undertaken at CERN&#x27;s CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) experiment, investigating the microphysical interactions between cosmic rays and cloud formation. These studies aim to increase understand the cloud nucleation process and its implications for climate models.

== Implications ==
Understanding how clouds respond to and influence global warming is necessary for accurate climate modeling and prediction. Changes in cloud cover and type could either exacerbate or mitigate the effects of climate change, depending on their properties and distribution. For instance, thinning high-altitude clouds tend to have a net warming effect, while thick, low-altitude clouds generally have a cooling effect. Increased knowledge in this field can inform policy decisions and strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. It underscores the need for comprehensive climate models that accurately represent cloud dynamics and their feedback mechanisms in the Earth&#x27;s climate system.

<text>Louis Marie-Anne Couperus (10 June 1863 – 16 July 1923) was a Dutch novelist and poet. His oeuvre contains a wide variety of genres: lyric poetry, psychological and historical novels, novellas, short stories, fairy tales, feuilletons and sketches. Couperus is considered to be one of the foremost figures in Dutch literature. In 1923, he was awarded the &quot;Tollensprijs&quot; (Tollens Prize).

Couperus and his wife travelled extensively in Europe and Asia, and he later wrote several related travelogues which were published weekly.

==Youth==

Louis Marie-Anne Couperus was born on 10 June 1863 at Mauritskade 11 in The Hague, Netherlands, into a long-established, &quot;Indo&quot; family of the colonial landed gentry of the Dutch East Indies. He was the eleventh and youngest child of John Ricus Couperus (1816–1902), a prominent colonial administrator, lawyer and &quot;landheer&quot; or lord of the private domain (&quot;particuliere land&quot;) of Tjikopo in Java, and Catharina Geertruida Reynst (1829–1893). Through his father, he was a great-grandson of Abraham Couperus (1752–1813), Governor of Malacca, and Willem Jacob Cranssen (1762–1821), Governor of Ambon with a female-line, Eurasian lineage that goes back even earlier to the mid-eighteenth century.

Four of the ten siblings had died before Louis was born. Couperus was baptized on 19 July 1863 in the &quot;Eglise wallonne&quot; in The Hague. When Louis reached the age of five, his youngest sister, Trudy, was twelve years old and his youngest brother, Frans, eleven. In The Hague he followed lessons at the boarding school of Mr. Wyers, where he first met his later friend Henri van Booven. On 6 November 1872 the Couperus family left home, travelled by train to Den Helder and embarked on the steamboat &quot;Prins Hendrik&quot;, which would bring them back to the Dutch East Indies. They arrived on 31 December 1872 in Batavia, where they spent the night at the then famous Hotel des Indes. The family settled in a house in Batavia, located on the Koningsplein and the mother of Couperus and his brother Frans (who was suffering from peritonitis) returned to the Netherlands in December 1873; his mother returned to the Dutch East Indies in April 1874. So Couperus spent part of his youth (1873–1878) in the Dutch East Indies, going to school in Batavia.

Here he met his cousin, Elisabeth Couperus-Baud, for the first time. In his novel &quot;De zwaluwen neergestreken&quot; (The swallows flew down), he wrote about his youth:
: &quot;We are cousins and have played together. We danced together at children&#x27;s balls. We still have our baby pictures. She was dressed in a marquise dress and I was dressed as a page. My garment was made of black velvet and I was very proud of my first travesti.&quot;
In the Dutch East Indies, Couperus also met his future brother-in-law for the first time, Gerard de la Valette (a writer and official at the Dutch Indian Government who would marry his sister Trudy), who wrote in 1913 about his relationship with Couperus:
: We met first at Batavia, when he was a boy of ten years and I was a young man. We saw each other at rather large intervals. Yet I saw him often enough, as a boy and a young man, that we developed a good and familiar relationship.&quot;
After he finished primary school, Couperus attended the Gymnasium Willem III in Batavia. In the summer of 1878 Couperus and his family returned to the Netherlands, where they went to live in a house at the Nassaukade (plein) 4. In The Hague Couperus was sent to the H.B.S. school; during this period of his life, he spent a lot of time at the Vlielander-Hein family (his sister was married to Benjamin Marius Vlielander Hein); later their son, François Emile Vlielander Hein (1882–1919), was his favourite nephew, who helped him with his literary work. At the HBS Couperus met his later friend Frans Netscher; during this period of his life, he read the novels written by Émile Zola and Ouida (the latter he would meet in Florence, years later). When Couperus&#x27; school results did not improve, his father send him to a school where he was trained to be a teacher in the Dutch language. In 1883 he attended the opera written by Charles Gounod &quot;Le tribut de Zamora&quot;; he later used elements of this opera in his novel &quot;Eline Vere&quot;.

==Start of Couperus&#x27; career as a writer==
In 1885 plans were made to compose an operetta for children. Virginie la Chapelle wrote the music, and Couperus provided the lyrics for &#x27; (&quot;Sleeping beauty in the forest&quot;). The opera was staged by a hundred children at the Koninklijke Schouwburg (Royal Theatre) in The Hague. In January 1885 Couperus had already written one of his early poems, called &quot;Kleopatra&quot;. Other writings from this period include the sonnet &quot;Een portret&quot; (&quot;A Portrait&quot;) and &quot;Uw glimlach of uw bloemen&quot; (&quot;Your smile or your flowers&quot;). In 1882, Couperus started reading Petrarch and had the intention to write a novel about him, which was never realized, although he did publish the novella &#x27; (&quot;In the house near the church&quot;), loosely inspired by Plutarch. When Couperus just had finished his novella &quot;Een middag bij Vespaziano&quot; (&quot;An Afternoon at Vespaziano&quot;), he visited Johannes Bosboom and his wife Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint, whose works Couperus greatly admired. Couperus let Mrs. Bosboom-Toussaint read his novella, which she found very good. In 1883 Couperus started writing &quot;Laura&quot;; this novella was published in parts in &quot;De Gids&quot; (a Dutch literary magazine) in 1883 and 1884. In 1885 Couperus&#x27; debut in book form, &quot;&quot; (&quot;A ribbon of poems&quot;) was published (by publisher J.L. Beijers with a book cover designed by painter Ludwig Willem Reymert Wenckebach). In these days a person Couperus greatly admired for his sense of beauty and intelligence was writer Carel Vosmaer, whom he frequently met while walking in the center of The Hague.

In 1883 Couperus saw Sarah Bernhardt performing in The Hague, but was more impressed by her dresses than her performance itself. The next year, John Ricus Couperus, father of Louis Couperus, sold his family estate &quot;Tjicoppo&quot;, located in the Dutch East Indies and gave order to build a house at the Surinamestraat 20, The Hague. Here Couperus continued writing poetry and his study of Dutch literature. In June 1885 he was appointed member of the very prestigious Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde (Society of Dutch Literature), two years after he published &quot;&quot; (&quot;Orchids. A Bundle of Poetry and Prose&quot;), which had received mixed reviews. Journalist Willem Gerard van Nouhuys wrote that &quot;Orchideeën&quot; lacked quality, Jacob Nicolaas van Hall was positive, and Willem Kloos called it &quot;literary crap&quot;. Couperus passed his exam on 6 December 1886 and received his certificate, which allowed him to teach at secondary schools. However, he did not aspire to a teaching career and decided to continue writing literature instead. At the end of 1887 he started to write what was to become his most-famous novel, &quot;Eline Vere&quot;.

==Eline Vere, the beginning of success==
Shortly before Couperus wrote &#x27;, he had read &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, written by Leo Tolstoy. The structure of Couperus&#x27; book &quot;Eline Vere&quot; was similar to that of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (division into short chapters). He had also just read &quot;Ghosts&quot;, a play written by Henrik Ibsen; reference to the leading character of &quot;Ghosts&quot; is made when Eline Vere is delirious with fever and cries: &quot;Oh god, the ghosts, approaching grinning&quot; – also the suicide by the main characters in &quot;Eline Vere&quot; and in &quot;Ghosts&quot; by taking an overdose of morphine is the same. Between 17 June until 4 December 1888, the novel &quot;Eline Vere&quot; was published in the Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Vaderland&quot;; a reviewer in the &quot;Algemeen Handelsblad&quot; wrote: &quot;The writer has talent&quot;.
Meanwhile, Couperus wrote a novella called &quot;Een ster&quot; (&quot;A Star&quot;), which was published in &quot;Nederland&quot; and made a journey to Sweden. In this period of his life, Couperus was an active member of the drama club of writer Marcel Emants (&quot;Utile et Laetum&quot; meaning &#x27;useful and happy&#x27;), and here he met a new friend, Johan Hendrik Ram, a captain of the grenadiers, who would later commit suicide (December 1913). In April 1890 the &quot;Nieuwe Gids&quot; (New Guide) published a review of &quot;Eline Vere&quot;, written by Lodewijk van Deyssel, in which he wrote &quot;the novel of Mr. Couperus is a good and a literary work&quot;. Couperus also met a new friend, writer Maurits Wagenvoort, who invited Couperus and painter George Hendrik Breitner to his home.

A second edition of &quot;Eline Vere&quot; was published within a year. Couperus finished his next novel, &quot;Noodlot&quot; (&quot;Fate&quot;) in May 1890; this novel was then published in &quot;De Gids&quot;. It is possible that the leading character of &quot;Noodlot&quot;, Frank, was inspired by the character of Couperus&#x27; friend, Johan Hendrik Ram, a strong and healthy military person. Couperus now started reading Paul Bourget&#x27;s novel &quot;Un coeur de femme&quot;, which inspired him during the writing of his novella &quot;Extaze&quot; (&quot;Ecstasy&quot;). In July 1890 he completed &quot;Eene illuzie&quot; (&quot;An Illusion&quot;) and on 12 August 1890 received the prestigious D.A. Thiemeprijs (D.A. Thieme prize, named after the noted publisher). In October that same year, he travelled to Paris, where he received a letter from his publisher-to-be, L.J. Veen, asking permission to publish &quot;Noodlot&quot;, which offer Couperus rejected because this book was supposed to be published by Elsevier. When his uncle Guillaume Louis Baud died, Couperus went back to The Hague to attend the funeral. Here Couperus decided to marry his cousin Elisabeth Couperus-Baud. The marriage took place on 9 September 1891 in The Hague.
==More successes as a writer==
On 21 September 1891, Couperus and his wife settled in a small villa at the Roeltjesweg (now Couperusweg) in Hilversum; after Couperus finished his new book &quot;Extaze&quot; in October 1891 he wrote &quot;Uitzichten&quot; (&quot;Views&quot;) and started with his new romantic and spiritual novella &quot;Epiloog&quot; (&quot;Epilogue&quot;). &quot;Extaze&quot; was published in 1892 in &quot;The Gids&quot;, and Couperus asked publisher L.J. Veen to publish it as a novel, but refused the offer Veen made him. In 1891 an English translation of &quot;Noodlot&quot;, &quot;Footsteps of Fate&quot; (translation made by Clara Bell) and in 1892 an English translation of &quot;Eline Vere&quot; were released. Meanwhile, L.J. Veen made Couperus a better offer, which he accepted, and Couperus received from Oscar Wilde his novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;; Wilde had read the translation of Couperus&#x27; &quot;Footsteps of Fate&quot;. and wrote to Couperus to compliment him with his book. Elisabeth Couperus-Baud translated Wilde&#x27;s novel into Dutch: &quot;Het portret van Dorian Gray&quot;. Dutch critics wrote divergent reviews about &quot;Extaze&quot;: writer and journalist Henri Borel said that, &quot;the book was something like a young boy messing with an egg&quot;, while Lodewijk van Deyssel found it great. Frederik van Eeden wrote that he had a specific aversion against the book. Couperus and his wife moved to The Hague, where Couperus wrote &quot;Majesteit&quot; (&quot;Majesty&quot;), after he had read an article in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; about Nicholas II of Russia. Gerrit Jäger, a play writer, wrote a theatre performance of &quot;Noodlot&quot;; it was performed in 1892 by the Rotterdam theatre company, and the then-famous Dutch actor , who was an acquaintance of Couperus, played one of the leading characters. On 1 February 1893 Couperus and his wife left for Florence, but they had to return because of the death of Couperus&#x27; mother. He wrote about how she rested on her deathbed in his novel &quot;Metamorfoze&quot; (&quot;Metamorphosis&quot;). During this time Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was translating George Moore&#x27;s novel &quot; Vain Fortune&quot;, while &quot;Majesteit&quot; was published in &quot;The Gids&quot;.

In 1894 Couperus joined the editorial board of &quot;De Gids&quot;; other members were Geertrudus Cornelis Willem Byvanck (a writer), Jacob Nicolaas van Hall (writer and politician), Anton Gerard van Hamel (professor in the French language), Ambrosius Hubrecht and Pieter Cort van der Linden. In September 1893 Couperus and his wife left for Italy for the second time. In Florence they stayed in a pension close to the Santa Maria Novella; here Couperus wrote in November 1893 a sketch, &quot;Annonciatie&quot;, a literary description of the painting of the same name by Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi in the Uffizi gallery. In December Couperus and his wife visited Rome, where Couperus wrote &quot;San Pietro&quot; (his impression of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica), &quot;Pincio&quot;, Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;cupola&quot;, &quot;Via Appia&quot; and &quot;Brief uit Rome&quot; (&quot;Letter from Rome&quot;). In these works, Couperus gave references to the works he had read about Rome: &quot;Ariadne&quot; by Ouida, &quot;Rienzi&quot; by Bulwer, &quot;Transformation&quot; by Hawthorne, &quot;Voyage en Italie&quot; by Taine and &quot;Cosmopolotis&quot; by Bourget. In February 1894 Couperus travelled to Naples and Athens, and then returned to Florence, where he visited Ouida. Couperus and his wife returned to the Netherlands, where Elisabeth Couperus-Baud made a translation of George Moore&#x27;s &quot;Vain Fortune&quot;; they went to live in the house at the Jacob van der Doesstraat 123. During this time Gerrit Jäger committed suicide by drowning. Couperus now started working on what was to become &quot;Wereldvrede&quot; (&quot;World Peace&quot;) and wrote a translation of Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;La Tentation de Saint Antoine&quot;.

==Consolidation phase==

In 1894 an English translation was made by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos of &quot;Majesteit&quot;; reviewers were not satisfied, and in the Netherlands Couperus new novel &quot;Wereldvrede&quot; was seen by critics as a flat novel, intended for women. Apart from that Lodewijk van Deyssel wrote a review in which he asked Couperus to get lost (&quot;De heer Couperus kan van mij ophoepelen&quot;), and Couperus himself ended his editorship at &quot;De Gids&quot; (April 1895). In October 1895 Couperus and his wife travelled to Italy again, where they visited Venice; they stayed at a hotel near the Piazza San Marco, and Couperus studied the works of Tintoretto, Titian and Veronese. The next city they visited was Rome, where Couperus would receive a number of bad reviews of his book &quot;Wereldvrede&quot;. In Rome he met Dutch sculptor Pier Pander and Dutch painter Pieter de Josselin de Jong. In March 1896 Couperus and his wife returned to the Netherlands. In 1896 &quot;Hoge troeven&quot; (&quot;High Trumps&quot;) was published with a book cover designed by Hendrik Petrus Berlage, and in April 1896 Couperus started writing &quot;Metamorfoze&quot; (&quot;Metamorphosis&quot;). In September Couperus visited Johan Hendrik Ram in Zeist, where Ram stayed with his father. Couperus spoke with Ram about &quot;Metamorfoze&quot;. That same year Couperus spend some time in Paris.
In 1897 Couperus finished writing &quot;Metamorfoze&quot;, which was to be published in &quot;De Gids&quot;. Meanwhile, Elisabeth Couperus-Baud translated Olive Schreiner&#x27;s &quot;Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland&quot;. That same year Couperus and his wife left for Dresden but also spend some time in Heidelberg. In August 1897 Couperus started with his new book &quot;Psyche&quot; and was appointed officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau. In January 1898, &quot;De Gids&quot; started publishing chapters of &quot;Psyche&quot;.

In February 1898 Couperus travelled to Berlin, where he visited Else Otten, the German translator of his books and who would also translate &quot;Psyche&quot; into German. With Elisabeth Couperus-Baud he left the Netherlands in May 1898 for a short trip to London, where they met friends and visited Ascot Racecourse; Alexander Teixeira de Mattos introduced Couperus and his wife during a high tea to English journalists and literary people. Couperus also met Edmund Gosse, who had written a foreword to &quot;Footsteps of Fate&quot; in 1891, and English painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who was a brother-in-law of Gosse. Via Oxford, Couperus and his wife returned to the Netherlands, where he finished &quot;Fidessa&quot; in December 1898. Couperus and his wife then left for the Netherlands Dutch Indies and arrived at the end of March 1899 in Tanjung Priok. In June they visited Couperus sister Trudy and her husband Gerard Valette, who was working as a resident at Tegal. Here Couperus started to write his new novel, &quot;Langs lijnen der geleidelijkheid&quot; (&quot;Inevitable&quot;). When Gerard Valette and his wife had to move to Pasuruan because of Valette&#x27;s work, Couperus and his wife spend some time in Gabroe (Blitar), where Couperus observed a spirit; this experience he would later use in his novel &quot;The Hidden Force&quot; (1900).

==After &quot;The Hidden Force&quot;==
Many of the details about the life and works of a resident in the Dutch East Indies Couperus derived from his brother-in-law De la Valette. He characterized &quot;The Hidden Force&quot; as: &quot;The Hidden Force gives back especially the enmity of the mysterious Javanese soul and atmosphere, fighting against the Dutch conqueror.&quot; Meanwhile, Couperus received a letter from his friend Johan Hendrik Ram, in which Ram wrote that he and lieutenant Lodewijk Thomson were about to travel to South Africa to follow the course of the Boer Wars as military diplomats. In March 1900 Couperus and his wife travelled back to the Netherlands, where in &quot;De Gids&quot; the text of &quot;Inevitable&quot; was published. In October 1900 Couperus and his wife moved to Nice, where Couperus read Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27; &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;, &quot;The Deluge&quot; and &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, while his own &quot;The Hidden Force&quot; was published in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Couperus started to work on his new novels &quot;Babel&quot; and &quot;De boeken der kleine zielen&quot; (&quot;The Book of Small Souls&quot;). In 1902 he was asked to become a member of the editorial board of a new magazine called &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;, together with W.G. van Nouhuys and Cyriel Buysse. In October 1902 Couperus&#x27; father died at the age of 86. His house at Surinamestraat 20, The Hague was eventually sold to Conrad Theodor van Deventer. Couperus and his wife kept living in Nice, but Couperus went in January 1903 to Rome, where he met Pier Pander again and also received a letter from his publisher L.J. Veen, in which he complained that Couperus&#x27; books did not sell. In May 1903 Couperus published &quot;Dionyzos-studiën&quot; (&quot;Studies of Dionysus&quot;) in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;, in which Couperus paid tribute to classical antiquity (a doctrine without original sin) and especially to the god Dionysus.

Couperus left that year (1903) again for Italy (Venice) and went to Nice in September. During the winter of 1903–1904, he read Jean Lombard&#x27;s work about Roman emperor Elagabalus; in 1903 Georges Duviquet published his &quot;Héliogabale&quot;, which was just what Couperus needed for his idea to write a novel about a crazy emperor (&quot;De berg van licht&quot;, &quot;The Mountain of Light&quot;). Meanwhile, to pay his bills, he wrote &quot;Van oude menschen, de dingen, die voorbij gaan&quot; (&quot;Of old people, the things that pass&quot;). In 1905 he published &quot;De berg van licht&quot;, which was rather controversial as it dealt with the subject of homosexuality. In 1906 Couperus and his wife left for Bagni di Lucca (Italy), where they stayed at Hotel Continental and were introduced to Eleonora Duse. In May 1907 &quot;Aan den weg der vreugde&quot;, a novella Couperus wrote while staying at Bagni di Lucca, was published in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;; he received another letter from L.J. Veen, saying that Couperus&#x27; books did not sell well, and so Couperus wrote a farewell letter to Veen in which he told Veen this was the end of their business relationship. During the summer of 1907 Couperus wrote in Siena the story &quot;Uit de jeugd van San Francesco van Assisi&quot;&#x27;(&quot;From the youth of St. Francis of Assisi&quot;) to be published in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;. From this period on Couperus claimed that the days of novels were counted and that short stories (called short novels by Couperus) were the novels of the future. Couperus would write a series of short stories, which he published the then coming years in magazines such as &quot;De Locomotief&quot;, &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; and the &quot;Kroniek&quot;.

==Endless travelling==
During the winter of 1908 Couperus resided in Florence, where he translated John Argyropoulos&#x27; &quot;Aristodemus&quot;; he published his translation in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;. In August 1908 Couperus and his wife started a pension lodge in Nice and placed an advert in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; to attract future guests. As of 27 November 1909 Couperus started publishing weekly serials in the Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Vaderland&quot;; he also published &quot;Korte arabesken&quot; (&quot;Short Arabesques&quot;, 1911, with publisher Maatschappij voor
goede en goedkoope lectuur) and a cheap edition of &quot;De zwaluwen neêr gestreken...&quot; (&quot;The Swallows Flew Down&quot;, with publisher Van Holkema &amp; Warendof). In December 1910 Couperus wrote in his sketch &quot;Melancholieën&quot; (&quot;Melancholia&quot;) about the death of his father, mother, sister and brother:
: &quot;They are the ghosts of Death ... These are the shades of my grey father, my adored mother, they are the ghosts of my sister, brother and friend. And between their shadows are the pale ghosts of the Commemorations ... Because the room is full of ghosts and ghosts. My silent, staring eyes are full of tears and I feel old and tired and afraid.&quot;
In the second part of 1910, Couperus started to write a novel again, despite the fact he earlier had said he never would write one again. This novel was to be called &quot;Antiek toerisme, een roman uit Oud-Egypte&quot; (&quot;Tourism in Antiquity, a Novel from Ancient Egypt&quot;) and was published in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;. The book would be rewarded with the &quot;&quot;Nieuwe Gids&quot; prize for prose&quot; in 1914. At the end of 1910, Couperus and his wife gave up their pension in Nice and travelled to Rome. In Rome Couperus collected and rearranged some of his serials, which he intended to publish in a book, &quot;Schimmen van schoonheid&quot; (&quot;Shadows of Beauty&quot;).

Since Couperus and publisher L.J. Veen were unable to agree on the payment of Couperus, Couperus then published &quot;Schimmen van schoonheid&quot; and &quot;Antiek Toerisme&quot; with publisher Van Holkema en Warendorf. In Rome Couperus visited Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica, San Saba, the Villa Madama and the Colosseum (among other things). He also paid a visit to the Borgia Apartment and wrote a number of sketches about Lucrezia and Pinturicchio, who had painted her. In 1911 he wrote in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot; a sketch about Siena and Ostia Antica. He read Gaston Boissier&#x27;s &quot;Promenades archéologiques&quot; and made long walks through the ancient ruins of Rome. He also visited the exhibition in the Belle Arti in Florence, where also Dutch painters exhibited their work. Here he met Willem Steelink and Arnold Marc Gorter, who gave him a warm welcome. Couperus wrote about the travelling he and his wife constantly did: &quot;your living or not living, what hast thou found, O thou poor seekers, O thou poor vagabonds, rich in suitcases?&quot; Couperus spend the winter of 1911–1912 in Florence; meanwhile the Greco-Turkish War broke out and influenced life in Florence as well. Couperus wrote a sketch called &quot;De jonge held&quot; (&quot;The Young Hero&quot;) about the son of friends in Italy who returned wounded from the front. In December Couperus and his wife left for Sicily but spent some time in Orvieto, where they stayed in the same hotel that Bertel Thorvaldsen had once visited. Hereafter they travelled to Naples, where Couperus admired the Farnese Hercules, which inspired him to start writing his next novel, &quot;Herakles&quot;.

==Trading places==
The first chapters of &quot;Herakles&quot; appeared during the first half of 1912 in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;. Couperus then stayed in Sicily, where he visited Syracuse and Messina; he and his wife then returned to Florence. During this period he visited Pisa and then travelled to Venice, where he attended the inauguration of the then-restored St Mark&#x27;s Campanile (tower), and wrote about it in his sketch &quot;Feest van San Marco&quot; (&quot;The party of San Marco&quot;). Meanwhile, publisher L.J. Veen gave a positive answer to Couperus&#x27; question if he would be willing to publish the bundled sketches. As a result, in 1912 and 1913 &quot;Uit blanke steden onder blauwe lucht&quot; (&quot;From white cities under blue sky&quot;) appeared in two parts. Couperus travelled from Venice to Igis and to Munich, where he visited a performance of Calderóns &quot;El mayor encanto, amor&quot; in the Künstler-Theater and a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Residenz-Theater. When Couperus celebrated his 50th birthday, &quot;Het Vaderland&quot; paid tribute to him by letting his friends and admirers publish praising words. Those friends and admirers included but were not limited to Frans Bastiaanse, Emmanuel de Bom, Henri van Booven, Ina Boudier-Bakker, Marie Joseph Brusse (the father of Kees Brusse), Herman Heijermans and Willem Kloos. A committee was formed to collect the funds required for Couperus to make a journey to Egypt. Members of that committee were for example Pieter Cornelis Boutens, Alexander Teixeira de Mattos and K.J.L. Alberdingk Thijm. Couperus however could not make this journey to Egypt because of World War I.

On 29 September 1913, Johan Hendrik Ram killed himself, shooting a bullet into his head. Couperus returned to Florence later that year and attended the futuristic meeting of 12 December, which was also attended by Giovanni Papini and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, at whom potatoes were thrown. Couperus admired them for their courage to speak despite the fact the public made so much noise they could hardly be heard. He also went to see the Mona Lisa, which had been found after it was stolen, at the Uffizi. Couperus said about new things such as futurism: &quot;The only thing that always will triumph in the end, above everything, is beauty&quot;. In these years he started reading Giovanni Papini&#x27;s &quot;Un uomo finito&quot;; he compared the new literary movement to which Papini belonged, with those of the Tachtigers in the Netherlands. He wrote an article about Papini&#x27;s book, which he called magnificent, an almost perfect book, and he compared Papini with Lodewijk van Deyssel. Papini and Couperus met in Florence and Couperus found Papini rather shy. Meanwhile, Elisabeth Couperus-Baud translated Pío Baroja&#x27;s &quot;La ciudad de la niebla&quot;. During this time Couperus&#x27; &quot;Wreede portretten&quot; (Cruel portraits) were published in &quot;Het Vaderland&quot;. De &quot;Wrede portretten&quot; were a series of profiles of pension guests whom Couperus had met during his travels in Rome and elsewhere. He also had a meeting with Dutch actress Theo Mann-Bouwmeester, who suggested to change &quot;Langs lijnen van geleidelijkheid&quot; into a play; although this plan did not come into reality for Couperus it opened possibilities for his books in future.

==Public performances==
When World War I began, Couperus was in Munich. On 27 August 1914 the son of Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, Luitpold, died of polio and Couperus went to see his body in the Theatrine Church. During this time he admired the German: &quot;I admire them because they are tragic and fight a tragic struggle, like a tragic hero fights.&quot; In September he returned to Florence and in February 1915 to the Netherlands, where he visited the premiere of Frederik van Eeden&#x27;s &quot;De heks van Haarlem&quot; (The witch of Haarlem) and met Van Eeden. He made a translation of Edmond Rostands &quot;Cantecler&quot;, although the play was never performed on stage. During this time Couperus started making performances as an elocutionist. His first performance at the art room Kleykamp for an audience of students from Delft was a huge success. The decor consisted of a Buddha and a painting made by Antonio da Correggio that Abraham Bredius had lent for this occasion. Couperus read &quot;De zonen der zon&quot; (Sons of the sun) aloud. While Couperus made his performances, L.J. Veen published the first parts of &quot;Van en over alles en iedereen&quot; (By and about everything and everyone) and publisher Holkema &amp; Warendorf &quot;De ongelukkige&quot; (The unfortunate) (1915). Couperus himself wrote that year &quot;De dood van den Dappere&quot; (The death of the brave one), which dealt with the end of El Zagal and started to write &quot;De Comedianten&quot; (The comedians), inspired by the Menaechmi; this book was published with Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar in 1917. Couperus read Ludwig Friedländers &quot;Darstellungen aus der Sittengeschichte Roms in der Zeit von August bis zum Ausgang der Antonine&quot; to increase his knowledge of Ancient Rome which he needed for &quot;De Comedianten&quot;.

In these years Couperus met S.F. van Oss, who was the founder of &quot;De Haagsche Post&quot;, who asked if Couperus would be willing to write for his magazine. Couperus later published his travelogues (made during his travels to Africa, Dutch East Indies and Japan) as a result in De Haagsche Post, as well as many epigrams. For his friend Herman Roelvink he translated the play written by George Bernard Shaw, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1916). As from December 1916 he restarted writing his weekly sketch in &quot;Het Vaderland&quot;, for example &quot;Romeinsche portretten&quot; (Roman portraits), during which he was inspired by Martial and Juvenal. He also continued giving performances for the public in the evening. In 1917 he wrote the novel &quot;Het zwevende schaakbord&quot; (The floating chessboard), about the adventures of Gawain; this novel was first published as a serial in the Haagsche Post. He read as research for this book Jacob van Maerlant&#x27;s &quot;Merlijns boec&quot; and Lodewijk van Velthem&#x27;s &quot;Boec van Coninc Artur&quot; (&quot;Book of King Arthur&quot;). In July 1918 publisher L.J. Veen sent Couperus a translation of Vitruvius&#x27; &quot;De architectura&quot; and Couperus wrote about it in &quot;Het Vaderland&quot;. Meanwhile, het Hofstadtoneel (Residence Theater) was about to perform the stage version (made by Elisabeth Couperus-Baud) of &quot;Eline Vere&quot;; this play received bad product reviews. During this period of his life Couperus read the works written by Quintus Curtius Rufus, Arrian and Plutarch to find inspiration for his next work &quot;Iskander&quot;. The year 1919 was not a happy one for Couperus: his favourite nephew Frans Vlielander Hein died together with his wife when his ship was hit by a mine and L.J. Veen, his publisher and his brother-in-law Benjamin Marinus Vlielander Hein died that year as well.

==Last years==
In 1920 &quot;Iskander&quot; (a novel about Alexander the Great) was published in &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;; critics were not positive because of the many gay scenes. In October 1920 Couperus travelled for the &quot;Haagsche Post&quot; to Egypt; his travelogues were published weekly. In Africa he visited Algiers, travelled to Constantine, Biskra, Touggourt and Timgad and then continued his journey to Tunis and the ruins of Carthage, where he met a pupil of Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier. After this Couperus went back to Algiers, because he wanted to see the boxing skills of Georges Carpentier. Afterwards he wrote: &quot;I thought that in my life I have written too many books and boxed too little.&quot; On 3 May 1921 Couperus and his wife returned to Marseille and travelled to Paris, in time to be present at the festivities held for the canonization of Joan of Arc. On 1 June, Couperus and his wife left for England, where they would meet Alexander Teixeira de Mattos and during which visit Couperus wrote &quot;With Louis Couperus in London-Season&quot;; these stories were published in the &quot;Haagsche Post&quot;. In England Couperus met Stephen McKenna and Edmund Gosse. McKenna had written the forewords for &quot;Majesty&quot; and &quot;Old People and the Things that Pass&quot;. He also met Frank Arthur Swinnerton during a lunch and went to a Russian ballet in the Prince&#x27;s Theater, where the orchestra was conducted by Ernest Ansermet.

He also met with his English publisher, Thornton Butterworth, visited a small concert, where Myra Hess played and also had meetings with George Moore and George Bernard Shaw. Couperus also had his photograph taken by E.O. Hoppé after which he had a meeting with the Dutch consul in London, René de Marees van Swinderen and a diner at the house of H. H. Asquith. The next day Couperus went to the Titmarsh club, where he met William Leonard Courtney, and heard Lady Astor, whom he had previously met in Constantine, speak in the House of Commons. Soon after this Couperus and his wife returned to the Netherlands.
In the Netherlands Couperus prepared himself for his journey to the Dutch East Indies, China and Japan. He and his wife left for the Dutch East Indies on 1 October 1921 aboard the mail ship &quot;Prins der Nederlanden&quot;. They left the ship at Belawan to stay with their friend Louis Constant Westenenk at Medan. In Batavia he dined with Governor-General Dirk Fock and also held public performances, where he would read out his books. After a visit to the Borobudur Couperus and his wife visited Surabaya and Bali. On 16 February they left for Hong Kong and Shanghai. In Japan they visited Kobe and Kyoto; in this last place Couperus became seriously ill, was diagnosed with Typhoid fever and was sent to the International Hospital in Kobe. After seven weeks he was fit enough to travel to Yokohama. He and his wife stayed for two weeks at the Fujiya Hotel, where Couperus read Kenjirō Tokutomi&#x27;s novel &quot;Nami-Ko&quot;. He and his wife then travelled to Tokyo, where they stayed with the Dutch consul and visited Nikkō. They returned to the Netherlands on 10 October 1922.

==Death and tributes==
Back in the Netherlands, it turned out that Couperus&#x27; kidneys and liver were affected. Despite his illness Couperus wrote a series of sketches for &quot;Het Vaderland&quot; and &quot;Groot Nederland&quot;. He also was able to visit the opera again and went to see &quot;Aida&quot;. In 1923 the couple moved to De Steeg, where Couperus received the rather prestigious Tollens prize. Meanwhile, a committee was formed to celebrate Couperus&#x27; 60th birthday and gather funds as a birthday gift. Couperus&#x27; health deteriorated rapidly and apart from lung and liver problems Couperus suffered from an infection in his nose. During Couperus birthday party a sum of 12,000 guilders was handed over to him and speeches were held by Lodewijk van Deyssel and minister Johannes Theodoor de Visser; Couperus was also appointed knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. During the following reception minister Herman Adriaan van Karnebeek and Albert Vogel, among many others, paid Couperus their respect. On 11 July 1923, Couperus was brought to hospital (in Velp), because the infection in his nose had not healed, but came back home a day later. He now suffered from erysipelas as well as sepsis in the nose. He fell into a coma on 14 July, remained in that state for two days with high fever and died on 16 July 1923. He was cremated at Westerveld, where Gustaaf Paul Hecking Coolenbrander (a nephew), among others, spoke to remember Couperus.

<text>The mayor of Philadelphia is the chief executive of the government of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
as stipulated by the Charter of the City of Philadelphia. The current mayor of Philadelphia is Cherelle Parker, who is the first woman to hold the position.

==History==
===18th century===
The first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.

In 1704, alderman Griffith Jones was elected but declined to serve, for which he was fined twenty pounds. In 1706, Thomas Story, also an alderman, was similarly fined for refusing office. 

In 1745, Abraham Taylor, a Philadelphia alderman, was fined thirty pounds for refusing to assume the office. The city council then elected Joseph Turner, who also refused and was likewise fined. Others who refused election included Richard Hill (1717), Issac Norris (1722), John Mifflin, and Alexander Stedman. In other cases, William Coxe pleaded illness (1758), Samuel Mifflin (1761), William Coxe and Daniel Benezet (1762), and John Barclay and George Roberts (1792). Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, and ended up 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor in Philadelphia history.

In 1747, at the request of retiring Mayor William Attwood, Council resolved to institute an annual salary of 100 pounds for the office. The same year, Anthony Morris secretly fled to Bucks County to avoid being notified of his election as the city&#x27;s mayor. When he could not be located after three days of searching, a new election was scheduled, and Attwood was reelected to a second term.

===19th century===
In 1826, the Philadelphia City Council altered its protocols for electing a mayor, permitting any Philadelphia citizen to run for the office. Beginning in 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) determined the winner between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 Philadelphia mayoral election.

The term of office for the mayor was extended to two years in 1854, to three years in 1861, and to four years in 1885. The Act of 1885 also prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.

===20th century===
The consecutive term limitation for mayor was lifted in the 1940s, which permitted incumbent Bernard Samuel to run for reelection. In 1951, the city&#x27;s Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for Philadelphia mayors. The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. 

The mayor of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats for over seven decades, since 1952. The only Republican who has been competitive in the general election for mayor since then was Sam Katz, who came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in 1999.

<doc id="538849" wikidata="Q956923" url="?curid=538849" title="Battle of Heavenfield">
<text>The Battle of Heavenfield was fought in 633 or 634 between a Northumbrian army under Oswald of Bernicia and a Welsh army under Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. The battle resulted in a decisive Northumbrian victory. The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (Annals of Wales) record the battle as &quot;Bellum Cantscaul&quot; in 631. Bede referred to it as the Battle of &quot;Deniseburna&quot; near &quot;Hefenfelth&quot;.

==Background==
An alliance between Cadwallon of Gwynedd and King Penda of Mercia had led to an invasion of Northumbria. This was an odd alliance between a Christian king of Brythonic descent and a pagan king of Anglian descent. At the Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633, the invading Welsh and Mercians had killed Northumbrian king Edwin and Northumbria was split between its two sub-kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira. Cadwallon&#x27;s army laid waste to Northumbria.

Eanfrith, who had been exiled under Edwin, became king of Bernicia, whilst Deira was ruled by Osric, a cousin of Edwin. According to Bede, Osric was killed by Cadwallon whilst trying to besiege him in the summer of 634, after which Cadwallon ruled both regions as a tyrant. Eanfrith&#x27;s reign was short, as he was killed by Cadwallon after leaving Bernicia to negotiate peace later in the year. Eanfrith&#x27;s brother, Oswald, then returned from seventeen years of exile, possibly including time spent in Dál Riata, to claim the crown of Bernicia.

==Battle==
It seems that the Welsh army advanced northward from York along the line of Dere Street. Oswald&#x27;s forces took up a defensive position beside the Roman Wall, about north of Hexham. It was claimed that the night before the battle, Oswald had a vision of Saint Columba, in which the saint foretold that Oswald would be victorious. Oswald placed his army so that it was facing east, with its flanks shielded by Brady&#x27;s Crag to the north and the Wall to the south. According to Bede, Oswald raised a cross, and prayed for victory alongside his troops.

It is believed that the Welsh had greater numbers, but they were forced to attack from the east along the narrow front between the Wall and Brady&#x27;s Crag, where they were hemmed in and unable to outflank the Northumbrians. It is not known how long the battle lasted or what the losses were, but the Welsh line finally broke. This began a headlong flight southward by the Welsh, pursued by the vengeful Northumbrians. Many Welsh soldiers were cut down as they ran, and according to Bede, Cadwallon was caught around south of Heavenfield and killed at a place called &quot;Denisesburna&quot; (&#x27;Brook of Denisus&#x27;), now identified as the Rowley Burn (sometimes Rowley Brook) near Whitley Chapel.

Afterwards, due to the miraculous victory by Oswald&#x27;s smaller force, the main battle site became known as Heavenfield (Heofenfeld) and became a place of pilgrimage for Christians at the time.

==Aftermath==
After the battle, Oswald re-united Deira with Bernicia and became king of all Northumbria. Bede believed that the importance of the battle was that it restored Christianity to Northumbria. Oswald spent eight years upon the Northumbrian throne before he was killed in the Battle of Maserfield. Oswald was succeeded as king of Northumbria by his brother Oswiu.

==Site today==

The road east of Chollerford that runs alongside the Roman Wall (B6318) has a wooden cross standing alongside it to mark the site of the Battle of Heavenfield. On the hill to the north of the cross stands St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Heavenfield, marking the spot where Oswald was believed to have raised his battle standard. The site is around east of the River North Tyne.

Another possibility is near Devil&#x27;s Water, as per Max Adams; Bede names the site as Denisesburn, now known to be close to Devil&#x27;s Water, per a 1233 charter to Thomas of Whittington discovered in 1864 (Tom Corfe, 1997). Adams posits that the battle began on the east bank of Devil&#x27;s Water, moving to the ford at Peth Foot.

St Oswald&#x27;s featured in an episode of Vera (series 10, episode entitled Dirty).

<doc id="538851" wikidata="Q314993" url="?curid=538851" title="Maurice Leblanc">
<text>Maurice Marie Émile Leblanc (; ; 11 December 1864 – 6 November 1941) was a French novelist and writer of short stories, known primarily as the creator of the fictional gentleman thief and detective Arsène Lupin, often described as a French counterpart to Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s creation Sherlock Holmes.

The first Arsène Lupin story appeared in a series of short stories that was serialized in the magazine &quot;Je sais tout&quot;, starting in No. 6, dated 15 July 1905. Clearly created at editorial request, it is possible that Leblanc had also read Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s &quot;Les 21 jours d&#x27;un neurasthénique&quot; (1901), which features a gentleman thief named Arthur Lebeau, and he had seen Mirbeau&#x27;s comedy &quot;Scrupules&quot; (1902), whose main character is a gentleman thief.

By 1907, Leblanc had graduated to writing full-length Lupin novels, and the reviews and sales were so good that Leblanc effectively dedicated the rest of his career to working on the Lupin stories. Like Conan Doyle, who often appeared embarrassed or hindered by the success of Sherlock Holmes and seemed to regard his success in the field of crime fiction as a detraction from his more &quot;respectable&quot; literary ambitions, Leblanc also appeared to have resented Lupin&#x27;s success. Several times he tried to create other characters, such as private eye Jim Barnett, but he eventually merged them with Lupin. He continued to pen Lupin tales well into the 1930s.

Leblanc also wrote two notable science fiction novels: &quot;&quot; (1919), in which a scientist makes televisual contact with three-eyed Venusians, and &quot;Le Formidable Evènement&quot; (1920), in which an earthquake creates a new landmass between England and France.

Leblanc was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; for his services to literature, and died in Perpignan in 1941. He was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery. Georgette Leblanc was his sister.

== Life ==

Maurice Leblanc was the second child of Émile Leblanc, 34-year-old ship-owner merchant, and of Mathilde Blanche (née Brohy) daughter of rich dyers, aged 21 and was delivered by Achille Flaubert, Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s brother. He had an elder sister Jehanne (born in 1863) and a younger sister Georgette Leblanc (born in 1869) who from 1883 until the 1920s was an actor and star operatic soprano.

During the Franco-German War of 1870, his father sent Maurice to Scotland. Upon his return to France, he completed his studies in Rouen. The young Maurice received his first education in a free institution, the Patry pension. Then, from 1875 to 1882, completed his secondary studies at the Lycée Corneille. As a teenager, he frequently encountered Gustave Flaubert and Guy de Maupassant.

Refusing the career that his father intended for him at a card factory, Maurice instead headed to Paris in 1888, to pursue writing. First a journalist, then novelist and storyteller. His first novel, &quot;Une femme&quot; (A Woman), published in 1893 was very successful, and was followed by other works, such as &quot;Des couples&quot; (The Couples), &quot;Voici des ailes&quot; (Here are wings) and his only play, &quot;La pitié&quot;, released in 1902, which is a failure, causing him to give up the theater for a while. In 1901, he published &quot;L&#x27;Enthousiasme&quot;, an autobiographical novel.

In 1905, Pierre Lafitte, the director of the monthly &quot;Je sais tout&quot;, commissioned a short story from Leblanc, that was to be in the vein of A.J Raffles by Ernest William Hornung and the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The resulting &quot;L&#x27;Arrestation d&#x27;Arsène Lupin&quot; (The Arrest of Arsène Lupin) proved to be a great public success. Two years later, the book &quot;Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Burglar&quot; was released, containing the first nine stories depicting the character that were published in the French magazine &quot;Je sais tout&quot;. By 1907, Doyle or his representatives had threatened legal action over the unauthorized use of the character, and Leblanc&#x27;s following collection of stories was titled &quot;Arsène Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes&quot;.

Maurice Leblanc received the Legion of Honor on January 17, 1908, presented by then Under-Secretary of State for Fine Arts, . While a supporter of French radical socialists and free-thinker in his early age, Leblanc became more bourgeois around the time of the First World War. Leblanc would start to grow weary of writing Arsène Lupin stories. As early as 1910, he tried to kill his hero in the novel &quot;813&quot;, but would resuscitate the character in &quot;The Crystal Stopper&quot;.
In 1918, Maurice Leblanc bought a half-timbered Anglo-Norman house in Étretat (which he would name Clos Lupin), where he wrote 19 novels and 39 short stories. Faced with the imminent war with Nazi Germany, he left Clos Lupin in 1939 and took refuge in Perpignan, where he died of pneumonia in 1941. Disinterred from the Saint-Martin cemetery in Perpignan in 1947, he was reburied on 14 October of the same year at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris, alongside his wife Marguerite and other members of his family (notably his step-brother René Renoult).

== Private life ==
At the end of 1888, Maurice Leblanc decided to leave Rouen for Paris where he married, on 10 January 1889, Marie-Ernestine Flannel (1865-1941). They divorced in 1895. By Marie-Ernestine Flannel he fathered Louise Amélie Marie Leblanc (1889-1974). Maurice later fell in love with Marguerite Wormser (1865-1950) who already had a son Claude Oulmann (1902-1994), who was subsequently authorized by decree to bear the name of Leblanc. Maurice had health problems and sank into a depression, which was compounded by Marguerite&#x27;s divorce from her first husband taking time to go through the courts. Leblanc and Wormser did not marry until 31 January 1906.

== Legacy ==

The &quot;Association des Amis d&#x27;Arsène Lupin&quot; (Association of Friends of Arsène Lupin) was founded in 1985 by the philosopher . Its members are sometimes known as &quot;lupinophiles&quot;.

Leblanc&#x27;s work inspired Gaston Leroux (creator of Rouletabille), as well as Souvestre and Allain (creators of Fantômas).

Arsène Lupin&#x27;s exploits took place in the capital and in Pays de Caux, which Maurice Leblanc knew well. Being a collector of postcards, he had listed no less than four hundred manors between Le Havre, Rouen and Dieppe. The &quot;lupinophiles&quot; roam the places mentioned in the intrigues of Leblanc in Normandy: Étretat and &quot;the treasure of the kings of France&quot;, Tancarville, the underground passage of Jumièges leading to the medieval treasure of the abbeys, etc.

=== In popular culture ===

The Japanese character Lupin III, first appearing in manga series &quot;Lupin III&quot; in 1967, was written as the grandson of Arsène Lupin. As this was done without permission from Leblanc&#x27;s estate, this was later the source of a lawsuit, though the copyright on Leblanc&#x27;s work has since expired. When the anime version was broadcast in France, the character was renamed &quot;Edgar, le détective cambrioleur&quot; (&quot;Edgar, the Burglar Detective&quot;). The authors of various &quot;Lupin the Third&quot; properties sometimes draw on Leblanc&#x27;s novels as inspiration; notably, the film &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; was loosely based on &quot;La Comtesse de Cagliostro&quot; (&quot;The Countess of Cagliostro&quot;).

Leblanc and his gentleman-thief character are also referenced in &quot;Persona 5&quot;, where the main character&#x27;s persona is Arsène. During the game, the main character resides in the attic of Café Leblanc.

Most recently, the main character of the Netflix series&quot; Lupin&quot;, released in January 2021, used Lupin as an inspiration for his own grand theft. Inspired by one of the Lupin books, he tries to avenge his father&#x27;s wrongful accusation of stealing a necklace years earlier. He decides to steal the same necklace from the Louvre by mimicking the style of Arsène Lupin. Parts of the final episode of Part One were filmed in the town of Étretat. This location is significant because Maurice Leblanc lived in the commune. Some of the works were written at his residence there. The building is now the Clos Lupin Museum.

<doc id="538859" wikidata="Q5126301" url="?curid=538859" title="Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve">
<text>Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve is a small regional park mainly located in the city of Oakland, California, and administered by the East Bay Regional Park District. The park is named for the canyon in which it is situated, Claremont Canyon, out of which Claremont Creek flows on its way to its confluence with Temescal Creek. Previously the canyon was named Harwood&#x27;s Canyon, and then later as Telegraph Canyon. The name was changed to Claremont by a developer of the nearby Claremont district.

==History==
Claremont Canyon was part of an 1820 Spanish land grant called Rancho San Antonio. It was used as a transportation route by Americans from the eastern United States. In 1858, a transcontinental telegraph line was built through the canyon. Starting in the 1860s, the Pony Express carried mail through the canyon to and from the eastern part of the United States.

EBRPD first bought an parcel of surplus state land east of the U.C. Berkeley campus in 1978. Then it acquired some more acreage in the immediate area from several individuals. Finally, it bought a parcel in Gwin Canyon. These acquisitions were combined to become Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve.

==General description==
Despite its small size of , Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve forms an important link in the chain of parks that line the Berkeley Hills. It rises from a height of about 420 ft (130 m) above sea level, just behind the Clark Kerr campus of the University of California, Berkeley to the average 1300 ft (400 m) ridge of the East Bay hills, linking by way of other conserved land belonging to the university and the East Bay Municipal Utility District to other parks such as Tilden Regional Park and Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve. It thus offers direct pedestrian access to the park system, with connections to public transportation, from the lower-lying residential areas of Berkeley and Oakland.

== Plant Communities ==
Claremont Canyon contains a variety of plant communities, both native and introduced. Coastal scrub is an important part of the preserve, housing coyote brush, French broom, lupine, monkeyflower brush, and California coastal sagebrush. Redwood groves can also be found in the canyon, containing both older and recently planted trees. Eucalyptus stands have been planted in the area throughout the years, though many local residents now are concerned they may pose a fire hazard.

==Activities==
The Preserve is relatively undeveloped and offers almost no amenities to visitors other than two hiking trails: Stonewall Panoramic Trail and Gwin Canyon Trail.

===Stonewall Panoramic Trail===
The Stonewall Panoramic Trail begins at a parking area on Stonewall Road, behind the historic Claremont Hotel. The trail is long and ascends .
The steep path up to the ridge gives splendid views across the cities of Berkeley and Oakland, and beyond to San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco. On clear days, especially in winter, the Farallon Islands, about 44 miles (70 km) away, can be seen beyond the Golden Gate.

===Gwin Canyon Trail===
Within the Preserve is a side canyon called Gwin Canyon with a trail accessible from the end of Norfolk Road near Strathmoor Drive in the Oakland Hills. The trail ends just above Claremont Creek, from the trailhead.

While the upper reaches of Claremont Canyon are technically outside the Preserve, there are an additional of open space contiguous to it owned and managed by the University of California. A local non-profit citizens&#x27; organization, the Claremont Canyon Conservancy, works with the public landowners offering stewardship services and educational programs.

==Access==
There is very little public parking available either within or very near the Preserve. Street parking is prohibited. Visitors can use mass transit to reach the UC Berkeley campus, then enter the Preserve by hiking.

<text>Erwin Rohde (; 9 October 1845 – 11 January 1898) was one of the great German classical scholars of the 19th century.

Rohde was born in Hamburg and was the son of a doctor. Outside of antiquarian circles, Rohde is known today chiefly for his friendship and correspondence with fellow philologist Friedrich Nietzsche. The two were students together in Bonn and Leipzig, where they were studying philology taught by Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl. In 1872, Rohde became a professor at the University of Kiel. He later was professor in Jena (1876), Tübingen (1878) and finally Heidelberg, where he died in 1898 after suffering from a gradual decline in health.

His &quot;Psyche&quot; (1890-1894) remains a standard reference work for Greek cult practices and beliefs related to the soul.

His work, &quot;Der Griechische Roman und seine Vorläufer&quot; (1876), was considered by Mikhail Bakhtin to be &quot;the best book on the history of the ancient novel&quot;, and it is still regarded as one of the greatest &quot;monuments of 19th century classics scholarship in Germany&quot;.

It is a concept album focused on the media coverage of a hoax formulated by the band claiming that &quot;Christianity Is Stupid&quot; from their previous album, &quot;Escape from Noise&quot;, had inspired David Brom to murder his family in Rochester, Minnesota, as well as other moral panics related to popular music.

==Structure==
The first half of the album is composed of the tracks &quot;Prologue&quot; and &quot;Helter Stupid&quot;. The two together form an extended piece lasting over 22 minutes. The concept, and some of the sampled material, came from a San Francisco television news program that was duped by a media hoax perpetrated by Negativland while promoting its previous album, &quot;Escape from Noise&quot;. Other samples used include those from Rev. Estus Pirkle (further samples from &quot;If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?&quot;, as used on &quot;Christianity Is Stupid&quot;), &quot;Spring Rain&quot; by Bebu Silvetti, Lenny Bruce, an interview with Charles Manson, and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; by the Beatles (in reference to the Helter Skelter theory of the Tate–LaBianca murders).

Parts of the &quot;Perfect Cut&quot; tracks on Side 2 draw from samples of &quot;The Winning Score&quot;, a 1977 presentation by TM Century, producers of radio jingles and imaging.

Chumbawamba sampled &quot;Helter Stupid&quot; extensively on their 2000 album &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;as inspired propagandists coming to terms with an ability to manipulate the truth, Negativland shifted their mindfuck campaign to a higher plane with &quot;Helter Stupid&quot;. &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; called &quot;Helter Stupid&quot; &quot;probably [the band&#x27;s] best and most accessible album.&quot;

<text>The Buick Electra is a full-size luxury car manufactured and marketed by Buick from 1959 to 1990, over six generations. Introduced as the replacement for the Roadmaster lines, the Electra served as the flagship Buick sedan line through its entire production and was offered as a two-door sedan, two-door convertible, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon.

The Electra initially used GM&#x27;s rear-drive C Platform, undergoing a significant downsizing for 1977.

For its sixth generation, introduced for model year 1985, the Electra underwent another significant downsizing, and adopted unibody construction as well as GM&#x27;s new front wheel drive C Platform — becoming along with its rebadged variants, the Oldsmobile 98 and Cadillac Deville and Fleetwood, the company&#x27;s first full-size, unibody, transverse engine, front-drive cars.

For 1991, Buick retired the Electra nameplate, migrating its front-drive premium sedan to the Buick Park Avenue nameplate, previously used as an upper trim level of the Electra itself. The Electra Estate was redesigned, becoming the Roadmaster Estate for 1991.

In late 2022, Buick announced plans to revive the &quot;Electra&quot; nameplate for its forthcoming 2024 electric models.


== Origin of name ==
The Buick Electra was named after Texas socialite and sculptor Electra Waggoner Biggs, sister-in-law of GM President Harlow H. Curtice. Also namesake of the Lockheed L-188 Electra airliner, Biggs owned a portion of the Waggoner Ranch (one of the largest ranches in Texas) and as a sculptor created busts of two US presidents and other American figures.

== First generation (1959–1960) ==
Following World War II, the Roadmaster constituted the upper echelon of Buick&#x27;s lineup. For 1958, Buick returned the Limited nameplate (dormant since 1942), slotted between the Roadmaster and the Cadillac Series 62.

For 1959, the Super was renamed the Invicta, the Roadmaster was renamed the Electra and Electra 225, and the unsuccessful Limited model was discontinued. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level Invicta and the entry level LeSabre. The Electra 225 nameplate was a nod to the car&#x27;s overall length of over 225 in (5,715 mm), earning it the street name &quot;deuce and a quarter.&quot;

The Electra 225 Riviera was the top-line model and it shared its six window hardtop roofline exclusively with Cadillac (which offered it on all of its models). Buick first applied the &quot;Riviera&quot; name to a premium trimmed 2-door Roadmaster hardtop in the middle of the 1949 model year, and thereafter denoted all Buick hardtops Rivieras. Also, from 1950 through 1953, Buick made a premium trimmed, stretched wheelbase sedan, exclusively in the Roadmaster and Super lines, that was called Riviera. But 1959 was the first year that not all Buick hardtops were called Rivieras. A standard 4-window four-door hardtop was also available, as was a 4-door 6-window pillared sedan, along with a stripped chassis of which 144 were built in 1959 and 1960. The two-door convertible was only available as an Electra 225, and the 2-door hardtop as an Electra.

For 1959, the Electra and Electra 225 both used the General Motors C-body shared with the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs, riding on a longer wheelbase than the B-body LeSabre and Invicta, both of which rode on . The standard and only available engine was the 401 cubic-inch Wildcat V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression ratio and mated to a two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission, which was also standard equipment along with power steering and power brakes using Buick&#x27;s unique finned aluminum brake drums. Power windows and seat and leather interiors were standard on the Electra 225 convertible and optional on all other models. Front bucket seats were optional on the convertible. Electra interiors were trimmed in nylon Mojave cloth or broadcloth combinations with &quot;Cordaveen&quot;. Electra 225 convertibles were trimmed in leather. Standard Electra features included horizontal Red-line speedometer, two-speed electric windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, electric clock, trunk light, glovebox light, power steering, power brakes, full wheelcovers and dual exhaust. In addition Electra 225s had Super Deluxe wheelcovers and an outside rearview mirror as standard equipment. Padded dashboards were also standard. The Electra, along with all other 1959 Buicks, featured all new styling not shared with other GM divisions that included slanted headlights in front along with a highly chromed square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and &quot;Delta-Fins&quot; back along with round taillights. The &quot;slanted&quot; headlights were also shared with the 1958–60 Lincoln Continental. Exterior distinction from other Buicks came from extra-wide moldings, with a massive Electra emblem on the front fender extension. The Electra 225 script was found on the front fenders ahead of the wheelhouse. The 4-door models had a lower bright rear fender molding as well.

The 1960 Electra and Electra 225 received a minor facelift with a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick&#x27;s then-new &quot;Trishield&quot; logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome VentiPorts first introduced in 1949 and last seen in 1957. Electra and Electra 225 models featured four VentiPorts on each front fender while lesser LeSabre and Invicta models had three VentiPorts. Electras featured wider rocker panel bright moldings and the Electra script on the front fenders ahead of the wheelhouse. Electra 225s featured a badge that was circled on the deck lid. The Electra 225 name was found on the front fenders in place of the Electra name.

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured &quot;Mirromatic&quot;, where the speedometer, odometer and any warning light indicators are reflected from an adjustable tilt mirror inside the dashboard for comfortable viewing that would reduce unwanted glare and reflection. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. Brisbane cloth interiors graced closed models while the convertible was trimmed in leather. Convertibles also had a two way power seat adjuster and power windows standard. The bucket seat option introduced on Electra 225 convertibles in 1959 was now available on Electra coupes and included a center consolette with storage compartment. Standard Electra features included windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, a single-key locking system, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, electric clock, trunk light, license plate frames, glovebox light, power steering and power brakes. In addition Electra 225s had back-up lights, a Glare-proof rear view mirror, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, map light and Super Deluxe wheelcovers as standard equipment.
== Second generation (1961–1964) ==

The Electra, along with the Invicta and LeSabre, was redesigned for 1961 with drastically shrunken fins, and was joined with the all-new compact sized Skylark/Special. Electras featured bright rocker panel and wheelhouse moldings. Four VentiPorts per front fender were a hallmark, with identification spelled out on the front fender plaques. Electra 225s had four &quot;hash marks&quot; interrupting behind the wheelhouse of the rear fender. Electra 225 nameplates were found on the front fenders. Electra interiors were trimmed in fabric. Electra 225s were trimmed in Calais cloth or leather trim, except for convertibles which were trimmed in vinyl. An optional Custom interior featured leather trim, while another featured vinyl with contrasting vertical stripes and front bucket seats with a storage consolex and power two-way seat adjustment. Standard equipment on the Electra included Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, &quot;Mirromatic&quot; instrument panel, directional signals, full-flow oil filter, electric windshield wipers, Deluxe steering wheel, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, Step-On brake, dual armrests, cloth and vinyl trim, combinations, carpeting, power steering, power brakes, two-speed windshield wiper/washer system, glovebox light, Custom-padded seat cushions and Deluxe wheelcovers. Two-tone Electras had the color accent on the rear cove. In addition Electra 225s had back-up lights, Glare-proof rearview mirror, parking lights, signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seat, Super Deluxe wheelcovers with gold accents and power windows. The Electra and Electra 225 were the same length in 1961. Buick discontinued the Electra nameplate at the end of the 1961 model year, leaving only the Electra 225 starting in 1962.


The big Buick of 1962 carried four VentiPorts per front fender and featured a rakish sculptured restyle of its 1961 guise. The hardtop coupe and standard hardtop sedan featured a convertible inspired semi-formal roofline, while the Riviera hardtop sedan continued to use six-window pillarless configuration. Electra 225 rear fenders had a group of vertical hashmarks, with Electra 225 spelled out in block letters just above. A full length bright strip crowned the upper body ridge, while the tower rocker molding and wheelhouses were accented with bright trim. Wheelcovers had a gold accent ring. Interiors were of the finest cloth and, on the convertible, leather was used. Standard features included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield washer/wipers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-on parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, power brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings.

Buick&#x27;s largest, plushest and most expensive models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders culminating in a sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges were found on the rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick&#x27;s new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.


The large General Motors C-body was used to create the 1964 Electra 225, Buick&#x27;s richest full-size car. Vertical, narrow taillamps were found in the nearly straight-cut rear fender ends, and the so-called &quot;Deuce-and-a Quarter&quot; came with fender skirts. Four traditional VentiPorts were found on the front fenders, with heavy die-cast grille accenting the frontal aspect. Wide front lower body moldings were used along with a bright deck cove insert. Electra 225 lettering was found on the rear fenders and specific full wheelcovers were featured. Vinyl and brocade cloth interior trims were found in closed models, while leather upholstery was offered for seats in the convertible. Among the Electra&#x27;s exclusive standard equipment were power steering; power brakes; two-speed electric wipers with windshield washer; foam padded seats; electric clock; license frame; trunk light; two-way power seat and power windows for the convertible; safety buzzer; and additional courtesy lights. The two-speed Dynaflow automatic was replaced by the 3-speed TH-400 as standard equipment.
== Third generation (1965–1970) ==
All GM passenger vehicles received a major redesign in 1965 dominated by flowing &quot;Coke bottle&quot; lines and fastback roof profiles on its coupe models, and the 6 window-body style was eliminated. For 1965, Buick also changed its marketing strategy and offering the Electra 225 in two trim levels, base and Custom. Along with the new body came a new chassis with a full perimeter frame including side rails that replaced the previous &quot;X&quot; frame used since 1961. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1964 including the standard 401 V8, and two versions of the larger 425 V8 that were rated at with a four-barrel carburetor or with two four barrels. The three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission was standard equipment. A new body style introduced for 1965 was the thin-pillar 4-door sedan, which featured frameless window glass with a thin, chrome fixed &quot;B&quot; pillar.

The 1966 Electra 225 saw only minor styling changes including a new grille and a revised full-width taillight and trunk lid that included an &quot;Electra 225&quot; script rather than the &quot;BUICK&quot; nameplate spelled out in 1965. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1965 with the exception that the dual-quad 425 was downgraded from a factory option to dealer-installed. Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a horizontal sweep speedometer, fuel gauge and warning lights. Front seat headrests became an option.

A moderate facelift highlighted the 1967 Electra 225 including a Pontiac/Oldsmobile-like divided split grille. Both base and Custom models were continued with a new &quot;Limited&quot; option package available Electra 225 Custom 4-door hardtop reviving a nameplate that graced Buick&#x27;s ultra-luxury flagship in the late 1930s (and again in 1958), which included an ultra-luxurious interior trim. Under the hood a new 430 cubic-inch V8 rated at with four-barrel carburetor replaced the previous &quot;Nailhead&quot; 401 and 425 V8s. Power front disc brakes were available as a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player.

The 1968 Electra 225 received a revised grille and taillight trim along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside, there was a revised instrument panel with a square speedometer and other instruments, plus a new steering wheel. Shoulder seat-belts were standard for both the driver and front passenger. Base and Custom models were still offered, with the Limited trim option available on the Electra 225 Custom hardtop sedan.

1969 brought a major restyling to the Electra 225 and other GM B-body and C-body cars with somewhat crisper bodylines than 1965–68 models, but continued with the same chassis and inner body structure introduced with the 1965 model, however the wheelbase was increased one inch to . The 1969s were also the first to offer headrests as standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate, and the steering column with ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel with the transmission in &quot;Park&quot;, a feature found on all 1969 GM cars one year before it became a federal safety mandate in 1970. Also new was a variable-ratio power steering system combined with revised front suspension tuning called &quot;Accu-Drive.&quot; Other changes included ventless front windows. The same assortment of base and Custom models were offered in 1969 with the &quot;Limited&quot; trim package available on Custom sedans and coupes. A new option available with the Limited package was a split 60/40 bench seat with center armrest. Finned aluminum drum brakes were again offered as standard equipment, while the Bendix four-piston disk brake units were also available. vented steel rotors were coupled with the cast iron caliper assemblies. A dual exhaust was available as an option. Five different rear axles were available: a 2.56 Economy as well as 2.73, 3.08, 3.23:1 gear ratios. The special PX-Code &quot;AC Delete&quot; 3.91 performance gear option was also available. The standing quartermile was completed in 15.5 seconds at a terminal velocity of for the dual exhaust engine with the 2.73 gear ratio in a Custom Convertible.

Only a minor facelift with revised grille and taillight trim marked the 1970 Electra 225. The big news was under the hood, where a new 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This was the final year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum brake drums and high compression engines. New this year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Also new for 1970 was the Estate Wagon, which shared the Electra&#x27;s 455 V8 and four VentiPorts, but was a B-body car like the LeSabre and the Wildcat and consequently shared the smaller cars&#x27; wheelbase and interior. This was Buick&#x27;s first full-sized station wagon since 1964. The following year the Buick Estate would move up to Electra&#x27;s larger body and more voluminous interior.
== Fourth generation (1971–1976) ==



Like the other GM brands, Buick completely restyled its B-body and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than ever before or after. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3-inch front shoulder room and 63.4-inch rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid 1990s. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass. All Electra 225s were hardtops in the 1971 to 1973 model years, eliminating the previous four-door pillared sedan variant and the convertible. In 1974 Buick adopted GM&#x27;s pillared coupe body and fitted it with the &quot;Landau&quot; option on the Electra Limited coupe. Optional driver and passenger airbags were also available from 1974 to 1976, but they were unpopular due to their cost.

In the first year for new GM C-body shared with Oldsmobile 98 and Cadillac, the 1971 Electra 225 rode on a new body chassis which retained the wheelbase with styling evolutionary from previous models. The new design included a double-shell roof for improved roll-over protection and noise reduction. Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel shared with B-body LeSabre and Centurion models that grouped all instruments with easy reach of the driver. Under the hood, the 455-cubic-inch V8 was retained as standard equipment, but featured a lower compression of 8.5 to 1 compared to 10.25 to 1 in 1970 as part of a GM corporate mandate requiring all engines to run on 91 Research octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasolines. Horsepower also dropped from 370 to 315 as a result. Standard equipment continued to consist of variable-ratio power steering and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission. Power front disc brakes were now standard equipment on Electras, replacing the finned aluminum drum brakes used in full-sized Buicks since the late 1950s. Also new for the 1971 Electra 225, as well as the B-body LeSabre and Centurion, and E-body Riviera, was a new power ventilation system. The system, shared with other GM B-, C- and E-body cars along with the compact Chevrolet Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn&#x27;t work. Within weeks of the 1971 models&#x27; debut, however, Buick—and all other GM dealers—received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.

From 1971 to 1976, Buick&#x27;s full-sized Estate Wagon shared the wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Electra 225, and shared its interior and exterior styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). And although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre&#x27;s, the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. These were the first Buick station wagons to be built on Buick&#x27;s largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53. The Estate Wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new &#x27;clamshell&#x27; tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. The clamshell system, heavy and complex, made it easier to load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy. At shipping weight, or about curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Estate Wagons are easily the heaviest Buicks ever built, even heavier than the Buick Limited limousines of 1936–42.

A new egg-crate grille and taillight trim highlighted the 1972 Electra 225s. The trouble-prone ventilation system used in 1971 was replaced by a new system using vents in the doorjambs instead of the trunk-mounted vents of 1971. The 455 V8 was carried over and now rated at 250 net horsepower compared to 315 gross horsepower in 1971. The differences in advertised horsepower in the two years was due to an industry-wide switch from &quot;gross&quot; (dynometer-rated and not installed in vehicle) to &quot;net&quot; (as installed in vehicle with accessories and emission controls installed) horsepower measurements. The 1972 Buick was available as: Electra 225, Electra 225 Custom, and Electra 225 Custom Limited.

A revised egg-crate grille above a new federally-mandated front bumper and revised taillights were among the most noticeable changes for the 1973 Electra 225. All engines now featured EGR valves to meet increasingly stringent 1973 emission standards (the EGR valve was featured on Buick engines for California cars in 1972).

New grillework and a new rear with revised taillights and a federally mandated rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Electra 225, still available in base and up level Electra Custom models. The Electra Limited, previously a luxurious trim option on the Custom models, was upgraded to full model status. Electra Limited models also got power windows, power driver&#x27;s seat and a new digital clock as standard equipment, along with an optional leather upholstery trim, the first Buicks (along with that year&#x27;s Riviera) to offer real leather seats since the 1963 Riviera. The 1974 Buick Electra Limited had velour seats and door panels that were the same as the 1974 Oldsmobile 98 Regency. The 455 V8 was revised to meet the 1974 federal and California emission standards with horsepower dropping from 250 in 1972–73 to 230 for 1974. A one-year only option for the &#x27;74 Electra was the high-performance Stage 1 455 engine with dual exhausts and a rating. 1974 was the last year for the pillarless hardtop coupe, although the 4 door hardtop would continue to be produced until 1976. Inside, the wrap-around instrument panel was substantially revised and optionally available for the first time (and seldom ordered) was a driver&#x27;s-side airbag system with an exclusive steering wheel design. 1974 was the final year for the Max Trac traction control option. New options for 1974 included radial tires and a &quot;low fuel&quot; warning light came on when the gas tank was down to only four gallons. A new distinctive &quot;Landau&quot; option was available on the Limited coupe that included the now-popular rear side opera windows and rear-quarter vinyl roof.

1975 brought about changes in all of General Motors C-body cars. In 1975, all Electra 225 coupes had fixed rear side windows and center posts. 1975 also brought along a newer front end and interior design. Rectangular headlights became standard on all GM C-body cars, along with many others. This supposedly would allow engineers to lower the front end to reduce wind resistance, but this wasn&#x27;t very apparent with the new design. The Electra received a new metal &quot;eggcrate&quot; style grille, which covered most of the front end, and wrapping under the headlights. The grille included running lights on either side. There was a choice of a base model Electra 225, whose trim and appointments were upgraded to the same level as the previous year&#x27;s Electra 225 Custom, an upscale Limited, and the Park Avenue. The 1975 Electra was also the longest Buick ever built at , which is over 19 feet. These cars dwarfed the newer front-wheel drive Electras and Park Avenues in sheer size and weight. Power windows and a power driver&#x27;s seat became standard on all Electra models in 1975. Also new to the standard equipment list were radial-ply tires. The 1975 Electra was one of the first GM vehicles to offer an Air Cushion Restraint System or &quot;airbag&quot;. Inside, a new flat instrument panel (shared with LeSabre, Estate Wagon and Riviera) with horizontal sweep speedometer (silver facing with black lettering) replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and door panel trim was revised. The speedometer was scaled back from to and kilometer readings were added. The 1975 Buick Electra Limited got an all new interior. Technical changes for 1975 included the addition of a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.

1976 brought about a few changes on the Electra. The front-end was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and turn signal lights underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights. There were also some minor interior differences. The brake release handle was black instead of chrome, the seat material was slightly different, on the limited, notch-back diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a &quot;corduroy&quot; form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance. The engine air cleaner did not have a &quot;cold-air&quot; ram air intake hose like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about the same size as the 1975 at , making them among the biggest Buicks ever.

The 1975 Buick Electra 225 Limited was the longest four-door hardtop car GM ever built, as the Cadillac Sixty Special (which was a bit longer) was unavailable as a hardtop sedan since the mid-sixties. The model also ushered in a return of the six window configuration that Buick offered between 1959 and 1964.

All Electras were powered by Buick&#x27;s 455 cu. in. (7.5 L) engine between 1971 and 1976. The 1971 model had , but that was reduced to by the 1976 model year; increasingly stringent exhaust emission limits reduced engine output, and an industry-wide 1972 change in rating systems reduced the horsepower numbers produced by any given engine. Even at its weakest state, the Buick-built 455 engine still produced of torque at 2000 rpm. The 455 was the standard engine on the Electra, but there were some built with Buick 350s during the GM strike, when 455 production halted. The 350 engine also came with a price rebate. The 455 engine disappeared after the 1976 model year, in favor of smaller, more efficient engines.

To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States, the standard colors available on all Buicks were Judicial Black, Liberty White, Pewter Gray, Potomac Blue, Continental Blue, Concord Green, Constitution Green, Mount Vernon Cream, Buckskin Tan, Musket Brown, Boston Red and Independence Red, with specially available colors on select models Congressional Cream, Revere Red, Colonial Yellow and Firecracker Orange.

Total production for this generation was 794,833.

Electra Limited Park Avenue: Introduced for the 1975 model year, as an option package for the Electra Limited sedan, the Park Avenue, was originally an interior comfort and appearance package, which gave buyers velour, pillow-topped seating, velour headliner, thicker carpet, and an upscale door panel design. The Park Avenue&#x27;s seats were designed by Flexsteel. This seating design was similar to the Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special with the Talisman (1974–1976) option and stayed with Park Avenue through the 1980 model year. The Park Avenue option also offered a full-size center console which eliminated the front, middle passenger space. The center console was eliminated in 1977. 1975 also offered a more luxurious Park Avenue Deluxe, which was sold only in 1975, and included every option available on the Electra (Positive Traction, 15-inch rallye sport wheels, rear automatic leveling, etc.). The Park Avenue Deluxe was an expensive option not popular with buyers; only 37 were built. The Park Avenue would remain as the top-level trim package through 1988. In 1989, the Electra Park Avenue Ultra debuted as the top model. In 1991, the Electra name would be dropped completely and Park Avenue would replace it as the flagship Buick sedan.

== Fifth generation (1977–1984) ==
For 1977, a fifth-generation Electra was introduced as GM downsized its C-body full-size lines. Again a counterpart of the Oldsmobile 98, the Electra shed over 11 inches of length and over 800 pounds of curb weight. Coinciding with the major size reduction, Buick ended production of hardtop body styles, with both two-door and four-door Electras offered only as pillared sedans. The downsized model brought increased sales, with 161,627 Electras produced in 1977.

As a consequence of the lighter body and chassis, the 455 V8 of the previous generation was retired entirely, with a 4-barrel Buick 350 V8 returning as the standard engine. The Oldsmobile 403 V8 was introduced as an optional engine.

The Electra was offered in standard, Electra 225, and Electra Limited trims; the Park Avenue option was added, though the full-length center console option was deleted from the option package. The Estate Wagon shifted to the B-body chassis of the LeSabre, though adopting the front fascia of the Electra (with premium versions sharing interior trim). For 1978, the Electra Park Avenue was added as a distinct trim level.

From 1977 to 1979, the exterior of the Electra saw minor yearly revisions. For 1978, the grille was updated along with revised taillamps; for 1979, the front fascia was restyled with a flatter look, adding the Buick emblem to the taillamps.

1980 update: For 1980, all GM B and C-bodies underwent a mid-cycle model update, with multiple aerodynamic enhancements to the body. Distinguished by a slightly lower hoodline, the sloped headlamp housings made their return, with a vertically-slatted grille. In a notable change, the Electra &quot;225&quot; model name (in use since 1959) was retired. To improve fuel economy, the Electra was no longer offered with a standard V8 engine, replaced with a Buick 4.1 L V6. The Buick 350 now became an option, with the Oldsmobile 5.7 L diesel V8 introduced as an additional option. 

For 1981, the Oldsmobile 307 V8 replaced the Buick 350. The 4.1 L V6 and 307 V8 engines were paired with the new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission, which used a lockup torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With this new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range. The 3-speed THM350 transmission was still used with the 5.7 L diesel V8. Also for 1981, the VentiPorts were deleted from non-Park Avenue trims. On Electra Park Avenues, the Ventiports became vestigial indentations in the chrome fender trim.

For 1982, all engines were now paired with the 4-speed overdrive transmission.

For 1985, General Motors downsized nearly all of its full-size lines a second time. While the Chevrolet Caprice Classic (which replaced the Impala entirely) and GM full-size station wagons remained, Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac shifted to the front-wheel drive C-body and H-body platforms; Cadillac adopted the C-body for much of its lineup, with the Cadillac Brougham (replacing the de Ville and Fleetwood Brougham) remaining to support livery and professional car sales.

Production of the rear-wheel drive Electra ceased in April 1984. Though it would use the slightly smaller B-body chassis (from the 1977–1985 LeSabre); the 1992–1996 Buick Roadmaster served as a functional successor of the 1977–1984 Buick Electra. As of current North American production, the Roadmaster remains the final rear-wheel drive Buick sedan powered by a V8 engine.

Buick Estate While GM downsized its C-body sedans for 1985, Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac full-size station wagons retained the full-size B-body platform for 1985. Buick continued the use of the Electra Estate name for its highest-trim station wagon, which also served as the flagship station wagon of General Motors (as Cadillac did not offer a station wagon at the time). For 1990, Buick renamed its full-size wagon as the Buick Estate Wagon (dropping Electra and LeSabre). For 1991, the B-body wagons were redesigned, with Buick introducing the Buick Roadmaster Estate.

== Sixth generation (1985–1990) ==
For its sixth and final generation, GM downsized the 1985 Electra, using the company&#x27;s newly developed C platform shared with the Oldsmobile 98 and the Cadillac Deville as well as their variants. Beginning with 1985 models, these were GM&#x27;s first front-drive, transverse-engine, full-size cars — offered in two- and four-door sedan body styles. Launched in April 1984, the 6th generation Electra was marketed briefly alongside its rear-wheel drive predecessor, which ended production the same month.

The C platform was essentially identical to GM&#x27;s H platform, shared with the Buick Lesabre (1986–1999), Oldsmobile 88 (1986–1999) and Pontiac Bonneville (1987-1999). 

Using unibody rather than body-on-frame construction, the sixth generation was significantly shorter (24 inches), narrower, lighter (604 lbs) and more fuel efficient than the previous generation — nearly matching the key interior dimension of their predecessors, losing only one cubic foot of interior volume while providing a more nearly flat passenger compartment floor. Automotive journalist for Popular Science, Jim Dunne, nonetheless noted the cars did feel smaller inside; they featured thinner front seats and more tumblehome, thereby locating the side glass as well as the windshield closer to passengers. 

Introduced in early 1984, for model year 1985, the line was offered in three trim levels: &quot;Electra&quot; (300, 380 or 430 correlating to engine displacement); &quot;Park Avenue&quot;, the luxury variant; and the &quot;T-Type&quot;, a more sporty variant. In 1989, Buick would introduce the &quot;Park Avenue Ultra,&quot; a more luxurious trim variant. Engines initially included a 3L Buick V6; 3.8L Buick V6, and 4.3L Oldsmobile diesel V6. By model year 1986, Buick would offer only one engine, the 3.8L V6 — which would continue to evolve as the sole engine for the Electra line.

Standard features included a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive; multi-port (later, sequential) fuel injection with mass airflow sensor; four wheel-independent suspension, marketed as &quot;Dynaride&quot;; 14-inch steel wheels with covers; power windows; air conditioning; rack and pinion steering; and electronic fuel door release. &quot;Park Avenue&quot; trim included coach lamps, cruise control, acoustics package, electric door locks and trunk release. &quot;T-Type&quot; trim included the 3.8-liter engine; upgraded, firm suspension marketed as &quot;Grand Touring&quot; suspension, ceiling console, quartz analog gage cluster, black-wall radial all season tires, re-calibrated steering, 15-inch alloy wheels, 45/45 bucket front seats with floor console; leather-wrapped steering wheel; and passenger assist straps.

Optional features included two-position memory driver seat, electronic instrument/gage cluster; analog instrument/gage cluster; 14-inch alloy wheels; driver&#x27;s sill-mounted button-operated keypad entry system, passenger and driver powered seats, and electronic climate control. An electronic rear load-leveling suspension was offered, using air-pressurized rear Chapman struts to maintain a level ride height. 

Aside from its waterfall grill, the Electra was differentiated from its Oldsmobile and Cadillac counterparts by an engine hood that slid forward several inches on opening, and pivoted forward from its leading edge to provide engine access from each side. A similar, &#x27;clamshell&#x27; approach had been initially considered for the trunk. On Park Avenue trims, an articulated chrome band that ran the length of the car, integrating the front and rear bumpers, and all trims featured a rear drop-in license plate holder (shared with the LeSabre as well as the contemporary Riviera) and tilt-up taillight assemblies for convenient bulb changing. All C-bodies as well as H-bodies, benefited from GM&#x27;s first effort to begin addressing the &quot;design&quot; of the engine bay, to provide a more logical, organized layout. 

1986: For 1986, the 3.8L Buick V6 became the sole engine choice. The spare tire and wheel were relocated from an upright position at the forward trunk bulkhead, to a flat position under the load floor; the federally-mandated Center High Mount Stop Lamp (CHMSL) was introduced; a revised &quot;shell system&quot; carpeting with an insulation layer and a preformed backing layer was introduced; anti-lock brakes became optional; electronic digital instrumentation became available; cell phone pre-wiring becameoptional; a retractable clothes hanger became standard equipment on the Park Avenue trim level.

1987: For 1987, flush composite headlamps replaced previous exposed sealed-beam headlamps, with fixed glass and replaceable bulbs accessible from under hood; outside sideview mirrors were redesigned. For 1987, a &quot;Electra Limited&quot; trim replaced the Electra &#x27;number nomenclature&#x27; trim.

1988: The two-door body style was eliminated for model year 1988, after an approximate total production of 15,000. For 1988, Buick introduced the 3800 V6, a major engine redesign, with the previous 3.8 L V6 version offered in some Electra models through model year 1988.

1989: In compliance with U.S. passive restraint standards, front seat-belts were door-mounted for the front outboard positions and three-point at the rear outboard positions. An optional remote keyless entry system with fob superseded the previously optional, sill-located, button-activated keyless entry. 

As a running change during the 1989 model year, Buick introduced the flagship &quot;Park Avenue Ultra&quot; trim. The Ultra featured silver lower body cladding replacing chrome trim, silver B-pillar overlay, trim-specific 15-inch alloy wheels, ant-lock brakes, trim-specific grille and C-pillar badging, vinyl roof with a &quot;frenched&quot; stitching and limousine-style rear window (as a no-cost option), leather trim on the steering wheel, all seat surfaces, door panels, rear pull straps, front and rear center arm rest and glove compartment door; dark burled wood trim; a package of 14 acoustic enhancements (at the roof, trunk floor, rear seat back, rear shelf, and rear shock wells), tinted glass marketed as &quot;Soft-ray&quot; glass; smoked tail lamps, silver accent body stripe; and a split front bench seat with a split frame design and dual 20-way adjustment, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro — similarly marketed by Cadillac on their 1987-1989 Fleetwood Sixty Special model. Originally offered in six two-tone paint colors (one extra cost Firemist color) and four interior colors (blue, gray, red and beige), the Ultra offered a no-cost-delete vinyl roof, power moonroof, cornering lamps, automatic climate control, and Twilight Sentinel. The Ultra reached a production of 4,815 for 1989.

1990: Standard equipment included a Delco radio with cassette and rear window defogger; door secondary seals were revised to reduce wind noise; windshield wiper system was made more robust, and the bodywork received structural improvements, including at the upper rails; junction of upper rails and tie bars; front lower rails, rear rails as well as a wider floor pan center section.

1991: For the 1991 model year, the C-body sedans were redesigned, with Buick retiring the &quot;Electra&quot; nameplate and making the Park Avenue a stand-alone model line, rather than an Electra trim level.

Engines: The sixth-generation Buick Electra was introduced with three engines: the 110 hp 3.0-liter V6 (Electra 300) served as the standard engine, along with an optional 3.8-liter V6 (Electra 380) and a 4.3-liter naturally-aspirated diesel V6 (Electra 430). For 1986, the 3.0 and 4.3-liter engines were dropped; the 3.8-liter V6 becoming the sole engine; and the 300/380/430 nomenclature was retired. The 3.8 was upgraded and now produced . For 1988, Buick introduced the LN3 3800 3.8L V6 – a major engine redesign, featuring a balance shaft and now producing and . The previous 3.8 L V6 version was still offered in some Electra models through the 1988 model year, denoted by VIN code 3. Electras with the new 3800 V6 were designated by VIN code C.

<text>The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) is the air branch of the Nigerian Armed Forces. It is the youngest branch of the Nigerian Armed Forces, established four years after the nation became independent. As at 2021, the air force is one of the largest in Africa, consisting of over 18,000 personnel. Some of its popular aircraft include the Chengdu F-7s, Dassault-Dornier Alpha Jets, JF-17 Thunder Block II, T129 Atak, Agusta Westland 109, Eurocopter EC135 and Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano.

==History==

Although an air force was originally proposed in 1958, many lawmakers preferred to rely on the United Kingdom for air defense. But during peacekeeping operations in Congo and Tanganyika, the Nigerian Army had no air transport of its own, and so in 1962, the government began to recruit cadets for pilot training in various foreign countries, with the first ten being taught by the Egyptian Air Force.

===1960s===
The Nigerian Air Force was formally established on 18 April 1964 with the passage of the Air Force Act 1964. The Act stated that the &quot;Nigerian Air Force shall be charged with the defense of the Federal Republic by air, and to give effect thereto, the personnel shall be trained in such duties as in the air as well as on the ground.&quot; The NAF was formed with technical assistance from West Germany (now Federal Republic of Germany). The air force started life as a transport unit with the first air crew trained with the Ethiopian Air Force. The second set of cadets underwent training in February 1963 with the Royal Canadian Air Force while some cadets were sent to train with the Indian Air Force.

The head of the German Air Force Assistance Group (GAFAG) was Colonel Gerhard Kahtz, and he became the first commander of the NAF. The nucleus of the NAF was thus established with the formation of the Nigerian Air Force headquarters at the Ministry of Defense.

The NAF did not acquire combat capability until several Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 aircraft were presented by the Soviet Union in support of Nigeria&#x27;s war effort during the Nigerian Civil War. On 13 August 1967, following several damaging attacks by Biafran aircraft, the USSR started delivering the first MiG-17s from Egypt to Kano IAP, simultaneously sending a large shipment aboard a Polish merchant ship. Initially two MiG-15UTI (NAF601 and NAF 602), and eight MiG-17 (NAF603 to NAF610) were supplied to Nigeria. Later six Il-28 bombers, initially flown upon deployment by Egyptian and Czech pilots, were delivered from Egypt and stationed at Calabar and Port Harcourt.

===1970s===
In July 1971, the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated that NAF had 7,000 personnel and 32 combat aircraft: six Ilyushin Il-28 medium bombers, eight MiG-17, eight Aero L-29 Delfín jet trainers, and 10 P-149D trainers. Other aircraft included six C-47, 20 Do-27/28, and eight Westland Whirlwind and Alouette II helicopters.

During the 1970s, Nigeria bought Lockheed C-130 Hercules from the United States. Six were acquired at a total cost of $45 million. 25 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21MFs and six MiG-21UM were delivered in 1975 upon the advent of the Murtala-Obasanjo administration that replaced the regime of General Yakubu Gowon. Most of these aircraft were deployed, making the NAF one of the most formidable air forces in Africa during this period.

Jimi Peters wrote: &quot;...the 1975-1980 NAF development plan restructured NAF formations&quot; into group (air force) level units that reported to air force headquarters. That structure, he went on, was found too cumbersome, and thus two intermediate commands (military formations) were formed in 1978: NAF Tactical Air Command and NAF Training Command.

===1980s===
From 1984, 18 SEPECAT Jaguar fighters (13 Jaguar SNs and 5 Jaguar BNs) were delivered and operated from Makurdi. They retired in 1991. Nigeria purchased 24 Aero L-39 Albatros armed jet trainers in 1986–87, having retired its fleet of L-29 that were donated to the Republic of Ghana Air Force at the inception of the West African Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) operations in Liberia. A subsequent attempt to expand the fleet by acquiring 27 more in 1991 was not executed.

===2000s===

In 2005, under the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo, the Nigerian Parliament appropriated US$251 million to purchase 15 Chengdu F-7 fighter aircraft from China. The deal included 12 F-7NI (NI-Nigeria) single-seat fighter variant, and 3 FT-7NI dual-seat trainer aircraft. The $251 million package included $220 million for 15 aircraft, plus $32 million for armaments: live PL-9C AAM, training PL-9 rounds, unguided rockets, and 250/500 kg bombs. The pioneer NAF pilots on the aircraft trained in China in 2008, while delivery of the aircraft began in 2009. Nigeria had previously considered a $160 million deal to refurbish its fleet of MiG-21s by Aerostar/Elbit Systems, IAI, and RSK MiG. However, it was considered more cost-effective to opt for acquiring the F-7s which were brand new. Nigeria also initiated modification of its variant of the F7, including installing some western equipment and avionics and hence its official designation as &quot;F7-Ni&quot; to reflect that its variant differs in some respects from a typical Chinese F-7. With this acquisition, the fleet of MiG 21s was subsequently retired. The Federal Government of Nigeria under the same dispensation acquired some ATR Maritime Patrol aircraft, built by EADS and Finmeccania / Alenia Aeronautica, boosting the capacity of the service to carry out extensive Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions on land and far into the sea.

From September 2009, Nigeria began refurbishing some of its C-130 aircraft beginning with the NAF 917 which it brought back to life with the support of U.S. Air Forces Africa and 118th Airlift Wing. The NAF has subsequently further improved its domestic capacity with the increase in the serviceability of a good number of its transport aircraft.

===2010s===
The NAF designed and built its first indigenous UAV, the &quot;Gulma,&quot; which was unveiled by former president Goodluck Jonathan in Kaduna, who said that the &quot;Gulma&quot; would be useful in aerial imaging/mapping, telecommunications, and weather monitoring. According to him, the UAV was rapidly becoming an important tool in news coverage, environmental monitoring, and oil and gas exploration.

On 24 March 2011, the new Air Officer Commanding of NAF Mobility Command, Air Vice Marshal John Aprekuma, explained the rationale behind the establishment of the headquarters of the newly established Air Force Mobility Command in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State as being part of the Federal Government&#x27;s strategy to protect its socio-economic interest in the Niger Delta, affirming that the presence of the command&#x27;s headquarters would bring about security and calm to the people of the State.

On 9 December 2011, the Nigerian Air Force commissioned its first female pilot, Blessing Liman, following a directive to the NAF hierarchy by former President Goodluck Jonathan, for the service to start offering flying opportunities to qualified Nigerian female citizens, especially since women had long been flying civil aviation aircraft in the country but did not get a chance to fly in the military.

In March 2014, the Nigerian Government approached Pakistan for the purchase of joint Chinese-Pakistani made CAC/PAC JF-17 &quot;Thunder&quot; multi-role fighter aircraft. In December 2015, the Government of President Muhammadu Buhari presented a budget to the National Assembly that included N5bn for three JF-17 aircraft. On 28 March 2018, &#x27;The Diplomat&#x27; reported Pakistan as confirming the sale of three JF-17s to Nigeria. In March 2020, NAF Chief of Air Staff announced the delivery schedule of three JF-17 Thunder to be affected in November 2020. It is understood that the Buhari administration will expand the fleet of JF-17 fighter aircraft upon an expression of satisfaction by NAF Generals, with the performance of the initial batch procured.

In December 2017, NAF formally announced that the United States of America had agreed to sell the A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft to Nigeria after the deal had previously stalled.

In November 2018, Sierra Nevada was officially awarded the contract for the 12 Super Tucano aircraft for the NAF, with an estimated completion date by 2024.

On 2 January 2019, one Mi-35M attack helicopter from the Nigerian Air Force helicopter squadron crashed in Damasak, Borno State while providing close-air support for troops of the 145 Battalion combating Boko Haram insurgents, killing all on board. The Mi-35 in the fleet of the NAF is the top-of-the-range model acquired in the life of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari that had also ordered several Mi-171 and Agusta 109 helicopters from both Mil Moscow Helicopters of Russia and Italy&#x27;s Leonardo Aerospace for the service.

On 15 October 2019, the NAF winged its first female combat fighter jet pilot, Flight Lieutenant Kafayat Sanni, and its first female combat helicopter pilot Lieutenant Tolulope Arotile. They were amongst thirteen other pilots also winged on the same day.

In April 2020, Embraer reported the completion of the first set of Super Tucanos out of the 12 on order, with an expected full delivery in 2021.

== Structure ==
The Air Force includes a service headquarters, 6 principal staff branches, 4 direct reporting units, and 4 operational commands.

The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) is the principal or lead adviser to the President and also the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Defense Staff, on air-related defense matters. The Nigerian Air Force headquarters is responsible for establishing long and short-term mission objectives and articulating policies, carrying out plans and procedures for the attainment of peace and stability. Also, HQ Nigerian Air Force liaises with the Nigerian Army and Nigerian Navy on joint operational policies and plans. The headquarters Nigerian Air Force consists of the office of the Chief of the Air Staff and 8 staff or branches namely; Policy and Plans Branch, Operations Branch, Air Engineering Branch, Logistics Branch, Administration Branch, Accounts and Budget Branch, Inspections Branch and Air Secretary Branch respectively. Each of these branches is headed by an Air Vice Marshal as branch chief.

==Incidents and Accidents ==
===Crashes===
*On 26 September 1992, a NAF Lockheed C-130H Hercules serial number &quot;911&quot; crashed three minutes after take-off from Lagos, Nigeria, when three engines failed, possibly due to high take-off weight. All 158 people on board were killed, including eight foreign nationals.
*On 25 January 2015, a photo appeared online at Beegeagle&#x27;s Blog, appearing to show a CASC Rainbow CH-3 UCAV which crashed upside down near Dumge village in the Mafa District of Borno State. The two anti-tank missiles on the CH-3&#x27;s wings appear to be intact. Borno is the area where much of the Boko Haram violence, including the massacre of 2,000 civilians, occurred in 2015. The Nigerian military is fighting to hold onto the city of Maiduguri against a Boko Haram onslaught, so it appears likely that the CH-3 in question was flying reconnaissance and fire support missions for the military when it crashed. The use of armed drones by Nigerian forces in combat makes Nigeria one of the first five countries to do that in combat history.
*On 28 September 2018, a fatal air collision involving two F-7 aircraft occurred during a formation flying exercise involving an Aeritalia G.222 and three Alpha Jets as they practiced flight maneuvers for the 58th Independence Day celebrations in the capital, Abuja. As the F-7 jets turned to the formation flying, their wings clipped each other&#x27;s side. Both planes lost stability due to the collision and it resulted to the spiral loss of both jets and they both crashed at the Katampe district of Abuja. Three pilots ejected out of the crippled jets. The two pilots who were on the F-7Ni ejected and landed with minor G-force injuries, and the third pilot on the F-7 ejected and sustained head injuries due to the problems from the parachute as it deployed. The pilot died on the way to the hospital as emergency services rushed to the scene of the crash. The Nigerian Air Force was notified and responded with search and rescue for all three pilots, while witnesses helped in evacuating the pilots from their stricken planes.
*On 2 January 2019, one Mi-35M attack helicopter from the Nigerian Air Force helicopter squadron crashed in Damasak, Borno State while providing close-air support for troops of the 145 Battalion combating Boko Haram insurgents, killing all on board.
*On 31 March 2021, an Alpha Jet crashed near Borno State in North Eastern Nigeria, after it was conducting an air interdiction on Boko Haram. At about 5:08 p.m., the jet was reported to have stopped pinging on radar and presumed to have crashed. The wreckage was reported missing and found nineteen months later by Nigerian Army troops.
*On 18 July 2021, while returning from an air interdiction mission in the North Western region of Nigeria along the Kaduna-Zamfara state boundaries, an Alpha Jet piloted by Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo was shot down by &quot;armed bandits&quot; in Zamfara State. Flight Lieutenant Dairo successfully ejected from the plane, evaded capture and made his way to a Nigerian Armed Forces base in the area with minor injuries. He was given a &quot;hero&#x27;s return&quot; by the Chief of Defense Staff and other top officers, Armed Forces of Nigeria, General Lucky Irabor, alongside other military top brass.
*On 14 July 2023, while on a routine training exercise in Markudi, Benue State, a Chengdu FT-7 crashed at 4:15 pm WAT local time. Both pilots ejected out of the jet and were rescued by the Air Force personnel assigned to search and rescue.
*On 14 August 2023, a NAF MI-171 Helicopter, which was involved in on &quot;casualty evacuation mission&quot;, encountered a crash at approximately 1:00 pm. The helicopter&#x27;s initial point of departure was Zungeru Primary School, with its destination set for Kaduna state. However, it was later determined that the helicopter had suffered a crash in the proximity of Chukuba Village, situated within the administrative jurisdiction of the Shiroro Local Government Area in Niger State. The number of passengers or crew members could not be ascertained. Meanwhile, Islamic Jihadists claimed responsibility for the incident.

===Errant Missions===

The Nigerian military has made several mistakes while conducting air strikes in recent times. One particularly fatal error happened in December 2023, when the Nigerian forces accidentally hit a village with an armed UAV in northwestern Nigeria killing 85 civilians celebrating a Muslim festival. The army said they thought the people were rebels.

In 2024, a Christmas Day airstrike in Sokoto state killed at least 10 people and injured many others. The military targeted the terror group Lakurawa in the villages of Gidan Sama and Rumtuwa, but civilians were caught in the crossfire. The incident raised concerns among human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which called on the Nigerian military to review its procedures and avoid such deadly accidents in the future.

Other reported and noteworthy incidents include:
*January 2017: The air force bombed a camp of internally displaced people in Rann, killing more than 100 refugees and aid workers
*April 25, 2021: A fighter jet mistakenly bombed a Nigerian Army truck, killing over 20 officers
*September 2021: The air force bombed a fish market in Daban Masara, killing at least 60 people
*December 18, 2022: An air strike killed 64 people in Mutumji village
*January 24, 2023: An air strike killed more than 40 herders in Doma region
*December 5, 2023: A drone attack killed more tgan 85 civilians who were villagers that the remote pilots reportedly mistook for terrorists.
*December 27, 2024: At least 10 people were killed and several wounded when military jets mistakenly bombed civilians in the northwestern state of Sokoto.
*On January 13, 2025, it was reported that at least 16 civilians in Nigeria&#x27;s north-western Zamfara State were killed in a military air strike, apparently after being mistaken for criminal gangs.

According to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based research firm, more than 400 Nigerian civilians have died during these types of incidents between 2017 and 2025.
Unfortunately, no significant lessons or operational changes have resulted from these mishaps as they seem to regularly recur.

<text>Warren Carlos Sapp (born December 19, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for 13 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, winning the Lombardi Award, Bronko Nagurski Trophy, and Bill Willis Trophy as a junior. Sapp was selected by the Buccaneers in the first round of 1995 NFL draft. He spent nine seasons with the Buccaneers and was a member of the Oakland Raiders in his last four seasons. Since 2024, he has served as a graduate assistant for the Colorado Buffaloes.

With Tampa Bay, Sapp made seven Pro Bowl appearances, earned first-team All-Pro honors four times, and was part of the team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII. He compiled 96.5 career sacks by the time of his retirement, which are the third-highest career sacks for a defensive tackle and the 28th-highest overall for a defensive lineman. His career, however, was also checkered by controversy from his hard-hitting style of play and occasional verbal outbursts. Along with Lee Roy Selmon and teammate Derrick Brooks, Sapp is one of three players to have his number retired by the Buccaneers. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Early life==
Sapp was born in Orlando, Florida, and raised in Plymouth, Florida, by a single mother. During the late 1980s, he was honored for outstanding football play at Apopka High School in Apopka, Florida at linebacker, tight end, place-kicker and punter. He holds school records for sacks, tackles for a loss, and longest field goal. A two-sport athlete in high school, he also played on the basketball team as a power forward. In high school football, his hard tackle of Johnny Damon in a game against Dr. Phillips High School team gave the future major league baseball star a concussion.

In 2007, Sapp was named to the Florida High School Association All-Century Team comprising the top 33 players in a hundred years of high school football in his home state.

==College career==
Many top nationally ranked college football programs recruited Sapp and he played at the University of Miami for the Hurricanes, where he was a defensive standout. He converted to defensive lineman and in 1994 won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (for best defensive player), the Lombardi Award (for best lineman or linebacker), and the Bill Willis Award (for best defensive lineman). As a junior at Miami in 1994, he had 84 tackles and led the Hurricanes in sacks with 10.5 sacks. He also finished sixth in Heisman Trophy voting that year.

==Professional career==


===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===

==== 1995 NFL draft ====
Ahead of the 1995 NFL draft, Sapp ran the fastest time in the 40-yard dash for a defensive tackle (4.69 sec). Sapp was considered a potential top five or 10 pick, but due to reports of multiple failed cocaine and marijuana tests released the night before the draft, many teams passed on him. He was ultimately selected 12th overall by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round. The NFL released a statement strongly denying the rumors and Sapp believed an anonymous individual attempted to intentionally sabotage his draft chances.

====1996–1999====
Sapp was almost immediately given the starting job as the right defensive tackle, which he held for his entire nine-year stay in Tampa. He flourished in the Tampa 2 defense, which included teammates Derrick Brooks and John Lynch. With his devastating combination of size and speed, he was able to disrupt opposing offenses even when double- or even triple-teamed on the line.

He finished his rookie season with 27 tackles and one interception and continued to be a prolific tackler for the Buccaneers. He registered 51 tackles and nine sacks in 1996, and 58 tackles and 10.5 sacks in 1997. His Pro Bowl selection in 1997 was the first of seven straight. In 1998, he signed a contract extension paying $36 million over six years. He was honored as NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1999.

==== 2002 ====
In 2002, the Bucs led the league in defense and won Super Bowl XXXVII over the Oakland Raiders. Sapp made five tackles and two sacks during that postseason.

===== Week 12: Mike Sherman confrontation =====
On November 24, 2002, at Raymond James Stadium, Sapp was strongly criticized for a blindside hit on the Green Bay Packers&#x27; Chad Clifton. The hit occurred during a Buccaneers interception return, when Sapp hit Clifton as the latter was jogging downfield, away from the main action. The hit inflicted a severe pelvic injury and hospitalized Clifton for almost a week, after which he could not walk unaided for the next five weeks. In 2005, the NFL Competition Committee agreed on new guidelines for &quot;unnecessary roughness&quot;, making hits such as Sapp&#x27;s on Clifton illegal.

In an exchange caught by television cameras following the game, Packers coach Mike Sherman approached Sapp and said to him, &quot;That was a chickenshit play.&quot; In response, Sapp screamed at Sherman: &quot;You talk tough? Put a jersey on!&quot; Sapp later called Sherman &quot;a lying, shit-eating hound. ... If I was 25 years old and didn&#x27;t have a kid and a conscience, I would have given him an ass-kicking right there at the 30-yard line.&quot; Sherman later added, &quot;The joviality that existed after [the hit] when a guy&#x27;s lying on the ground, with numbness in his legs and fingers, I just thought that wasn&#x27;t appropriate for any NFL player.&quot;

===== Week 16: First skipping incident =====
During pregame warmups for the December 23, 2002 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game at Raymond James Stadium, Sapp skipped among the Pittsburgh Steelers as they warmed up. Steelers running back Jerome Bettis shoved him, touching off a heated argument between the two teams. Sapp was not fined for the incident, but it added to his controversial image and he felt he had been made an example by the NFL by being fined for a second Monday night skipping incident (described below). &quot;That&#x27;s all this is about,&quot; said Sapp. &quot;In my nine years in this league, no one&#x27;s been fined for verbally abusing officials. It&#x27;s unprecedented.&quot; The Buccaneers had been earlier ridiculed by Steelers&#x27; Lee Flowers as being &quot;paper champions.&quot;

==== 2003 ====
In 2003, during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Indianapolis Colts on October 6, Sapp was scolded for skipping through and disrupting the Colts, who were spread out on the field stretching during warmups. Much anticipation and national interest going into the game had been generated by the return of former head coach Tony Dungy to Tampa. The Colts wound up erasing a 21-point deficit in the final four minutes and defeating the Buccaneers 38–35 in overtime, sending the defending champions into a downslide.

The next Sunday, October 12, 2003, before the Buccaneers took on the Washington Redskins, Sapp, while running onto the field, bumped into an NFL referee and drew a $50,000 fine. His response: &quot;It&#x27;s a slave system. Make no mistake about it. Slavemaster say you can&#x27;t do it, don&#x27;t do it. They&#x27;ll make an example out of you.&quot;

===Oakland Raiders===

In 2004, Sapp was reportedly interested in accepting a contract offer from the Cincinnati Bengals for four years worth $16 million, but on March 20 he announced he had agreed to terms on a seven-year, $36.6 million contract with the Oakland Raiders, the same team he had helped rout in the Super Bowl in early 2003.

He started all 16 games in his first season in Oakland, splitting time at defensive end and defensive tackle, recording 30 tackles (18 solo) and 2.5 sacks and recovering two fumbles after having lost an estimated 20 pounds before joining the Raiders for the 2004 season.

His 2005 season got off to a great beginning back in his familiar defensive tackle position. He started the first ten games of the season with 29 tackles (26 of them solo), and finished second on the team to Derrick Burgess with five sacks before being sidelined for the last six games of 2005 with a shoulder injury.

He returned to his All-Pro form in 2006. He had 10 sacks to go along with 32 tackles (16 solo) and one forced fumble.

==== 2007 ====
He lost 49 lb before the 2007 season, and recorded 37 tackles (24 solo), 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles.

On December 23, 2007, Sapp got ejected after an altercation with the officials near the end of the second quarter of the Raiders&#x27; game at Jacksonville. The incident began when linesman Jerry Bergman mistakenly assumed that the Raiders would decline a ten-yard Jaguar penalty. Sapp, the defensive captain, shot back at referee Jerome Boger, that the Raiders wanted to accept the penalty. The conversation became heated, with Sapp gesturing and swearing, provoking Boger to flag him for unsportsmanlike conduct. But Sapp and the rest of the Raider defense continued to mouth off at the officials, resulting in a second unsportsmanlike against Sapp and a third unsportsmanlike against teammate Derrick Burgess. Finally, the coaches ran onto the field and, along with the officials, began physically separating the disgruntled players. Boger claimed that Sapp had &quot;bumped&quot; him in the process, while Sapp denied any physical contact. In any event, Boger then levied a third unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Sapp (fourth against the team) and ejected him. The league eventually fined him $75,000, and Burgess $25,000 (i.e., $25,000 for each unsportsmanlike penalty).

On January 3, 2008, Sapp told Raider owner Al Davis over the phone that he would retire and confirmed this on his website qbkilla.com in just two words: &quot;I&#x27;M DONE!&quot; The retirement became official on March 4, 2008.

===Legacy===

At the time of his retirement, Sapp was one of only twelve defensive players in NFL history to make the Pro Bowl, be named Defensive Player of the Year and win a Super Bowl or pre-Super Bowl NFL title. The others are Mean Joe Greene, Jack Lambert, Mel Blount, Lester Hayes, Mike Singletary, Lawrence Taylor, Bob Sanders, Deion Sanders, Reggie White, Ray Lewis, Rod Woodson, and Sapp&#x27;s former teammate, Derrick Brooks. Michael Strahan, James Harrison, Ed Reed, Troy Polamalu, Charles Woodson, Terrell Suggs, Stephon Gilmore, and Aaron Donald have since joined the list. He is now considered to be the prototype three-technique defensive tackle, and ever since his retirement NFL teams scouting defensive tackles have reportedly been looking for a &quot;Baby Sapp&quot;. He was selected to seven Pro Bowls, was named a first-team All-Pro four times and a second-team All-Pro twice, voted to the 1990s and 2000s All-Decade Teams, and earned Defensive Player of the Year honors after a 12.5-sack season in 1999.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
In January 1998, Sapp married Jamiko Vaughn. The couple have two children, daughter Mercedes in 1998 and son Warren Sapp II in 2000.

In 2023, Sapp graduated from Texas Seminary Christian University with a Bachelor of Arts in Christian Sports Management. The degree allowed him to work as a Colorado Buffaloes football staff member.
===Activities===
Sapp, Devin Bush and a developer created an &quot;Urban Solutions Group&quot; in 2006 to construct low-income housing in Fort Pierce, Florida. The PNC Bank loaned the group money, but by 2008 the real estate market tanked and the project ended in failure.

On August 19, 2008, Sapp was hired as a studio analyst for &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; on Showtime, a position he held until 2011.

In the fall of 2008, Sapp appeared as a contestant on the seventh season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Sapp&#x27;s partner for the competition was professional dancer Kym Johnson; the pair made it to the finals where they were eventually named runner-up of season 7.

He made his stand-up comedy debut at the Comedy Central Roast of Larry the Cable Guy on March 16, 2009.

He worked for NFL Network as an analyst featured on &quot;NFL Total Access&quot; and &quot;NFL GameDay Morning&quot; until he was fired in 2015 following his arrest for solicitation. In the summer of 2012 he released a book titled &quot;Sapp Attack&quot; through St. Martins Publishing.

In June 2012, Sapp teamed up with the NOC (Network of Champions), a YouTube premium content channel, to produce a TV show series called &quot;Judge Sapp&quot;. He also participated in Fox&#x27;s dating game show &quot;The Choice&quot;.

In January 2013, Sapp worked with Dr. Jonathan Greenburg to raise awareness about the importance of getting tested and treated for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea.

He was also a celebrity judge on the second season of the reality show &quot;BBQ Pitmasters&quot;.

On July 27, 2016, Sapp was bitten by a shark while lobstering off the coast of Florida.

In October 2020 the internet sportsbook BetUS announced Warren Sapp and Brian Jones as the hosts of the weekly podcast &quot;BetUS Unfiltered&quot;. Sapp and Jones have interviewed celebrities such as Derrick Johnson, Adam Schefter, Ray Lewis, Kevin Carter, Rick Neuheisel, and Jen Welter on the podcast.

===Legal troubles===
On February 7, 2010, Sapp was arrested in South Florida and charged with domestic battery while in Florida as an analyst for the NFL Network&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XLIV, but following the arrest the NFL Network cancelled his appearance. On March 24, however, the charges against Sapp were dropped.

On February 2, 2015, the day after Super Bowl XLIX, Sapp was arrested on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute and assault. Later that day it was revealed Sapp&#x27;s contract had been terminated by the NFL Network. In May 2015 the charges were dismissed.

===Bankruptcy===
In 2010, PNC Bank was awarded a judgment of $988,691.99, and in December 2011 filed a monthly lien of $33,333 against Sapp&#x27;s $45,000 NFL Network paycheck. He also owed the Internal Revenue Service $853,003 from income in 2006 and $89,775 for 2010. He was $876,000 behind on alimony and child support for his former spouse, owed $68,738 for unpaid property taxes in Windermere and owed money to attorneys, friends and a speech therapist as well.

On April 7, 2012, the Associated Press reported that Sapp had filed for bankruptcy in an effort to discharge debt from failed businesses. In these Chapter 7 filings, he claimed to have lost his University of Miami championship rings and his Buccaneer Super Bowl ring. The balance in his checking and savings accounts was said to be less than $1,000. He claimed no credit card debt and owns no automobiles, but owes National Car Rental $90,685 through his business, Nine-Nine LLC. Court filings indicated Sapp&#x27;s assets totaled $6.45 million against a debt of $6.7 million. His monthly income was reported as $115,861. On November 1, 2012, Sapp&#x27;s house in Windermere was auctioned off and sold for $2.9 million.

<text>Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. In a secondary meaning, it may refer to streaming television where all viewers watch the same stream simultaneously, rather than watching video on demand.

Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, reality programs and, occasionally, episodes of scripted television series.

Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some scripted television shows remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others.

== Types of programs ==
From the early days of television until about 1958, live television was used heavily, except for filmed programs such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Although videotape was invented in 1956, it cost $300 per one hour reel ()
slowing its adoption. Some genres, such as soap operas, did not completely abandon live broadcasts until the mid-1970s.

In general, a live television program was more common for broadcasting content produced specifically for commercial television in the early years of the medium, before technologies such as video tape appeared. As video tape recorders (VTR) became more prevalent, many entertainment programs were recorded and edited before broadcasting rather than being shown live.

=== Morning shows ===
As of September 2021, Television networks provide most live television for morning shows with television programs such as: &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;Breakfast with Eamonn and Isabel&quot;, etc. broadcast live in the UK; &quot;Sunrise&quot; live in Australia; &quot;Your Morning&quot; live in Canada; and &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; in the U.S., which air live only in the Eastern Time Zone. The only exceptions are &quot;CBS Saturday Morning&quot; and &quot;Sunday Today with Willie Geist&quot;, which air live in the Eastern and Central time zones. Spanish-language morning shows (such as &quot;Despierta America&quot; and &quot;Un Nuevo Día&quot;), unlike their English speaking counterparts, air live in across the mainland U.S. except for viewers in the Pacific time zone, which, along with viewers in Hawaii and Alaska, have tape-delayed shows.

A few daytime talk shows in the U.S. broadcast live before a studio audience in select time zones. Shows such as &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; and &quot;Sherri&quot; air live in the Eastern time zone only, while ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; air live in the Eastern and Central time zones. A separate program is taped on Thursday afternoon for airing on Friday. Affiliates in the remaining time zones air these programs on a tape delay. Most other daytime talk shows and late night programs are taped before a live studio audience earlier in the day and edited for later broadcast.

=== Entertainment shows ===
Major entertainment events, such as award shows and beauty pageants, are often broadcast live in primetime hours based on U.S. East Coast&#x27;s schedule. In the 21st century, reality competition franchises began to emerge (such as, in the United States, &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot;), where viewers could vote for their favorite acts featured in live performances, but &quot;American Idol&quot;, as of 2025, is the only reality competition series to have broadcast live in all U.S. territories at the same time.

Scheduling of live entertainment programming may be complicated in countries that span multiple time zones, such as Mexico, Canada and the United States, where programming is aired live in the easternmost time zones, but may be delayed in order to air in local primetime hours in western markets (although since the last decade, Canada and Mexico have regularly televised all major live events simultaneously across all of their territories).

Historically, live global sports and breaking international news programming are usually broadcast live in all time zones worldwide. Several award shows began to air live in all time zones worldwide in order to avert the need to avoid &quot;spoilers&quot; via the internet and social media outlets in the onset of the latter&#x27;s rise in the late 2000s. For decades, the Academy Awards have continuously broadcast live in Alaska and both U.S. coasts (and now including Hawaii and American Samoa by the late 2010s), and are later joined by the Golden Globe Awards since the early 2010s. In recent years, the Primetime Emmy Awards, Grammy Awards and Tony Awards have joined airing live in all U.S. territories.

Some award shows like the Billboard Music Awards and the MTV Video Music Awards have switched annually between delayed and live nationwide telecasts since the mid-2010s as a result of the declining viewership across live event television in the same period.

=== News shows ===
Most local television station newscasts are broadcast live in the U.S. as they are an essential medium for providing up-to-the-minute weather forecasts and breaking news stories. Broadcast television networks in the United States typically air their evening newscasts live in the Eastern and Central time zones. A separate &quot;Western Edition&quot; is broadcast to viewers in the Pacific Time Zone to account for latest news updates, and may sometimes be a second live broadcast with the same running time as the original East Coast airing. When a major breaking news event occurs, whether nationally or globally, broadcast television networks will break into regularly scheduled programming and will televise a live &quot;special report&quot; in all time zones. Local television stations break into regularly scheduled programming in the event of severe weather warnings or major local breaking news stories that occur within their viewing area.

Cable news outlets (such as CNN and Fox News Channel) air continuous live programming during the day, and air rebroadcasts of earlier live shows during the late night hours, except in cases where breaking news occurs. The &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; airs live on PBS stations in the Eastern Time Zone. Sunday morning news programs in the USA such as &quot;Meet The Press&quot; on NBC, &quot;This Week&quot; on ABC, and &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; air live in the Eastern Time Zone (including a limited number of small markets in the Central Time Zone), while &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;Face The Nation&quot; on CBS air live in the Eastern and Central time zones.

Cable outlets (such as CNN and Fox News Channel) incorporate the word &quot;LIVE&quot; in their network logo (also known as a digital on-screen graphic) when those networks broadcast live content. Some (but not all) sports cable networks will opt to insert the word &quot;LIVE&quot; somewhere on the corner of the screen. With the exception of special breaking news reports and overseas sporting events, broadcast television networks rarely display such a graphic during its live programming. (although NBC did display the word LIVE next to their logo during its Olympic coverage when live content was being broadcast, a practice that was continued by its sister station, NBCSN, until its closure in 2021.)

Local television station newscasts display time and temperature during their broadcasts, and only display the word LIVE when they air a news report or a live shot on location. Some networks have begun to insert (in addition to the word LIVE) the local time of where that news report is originating from, particularly when that report is airing live via satellite from overseas.

=== Sports and other events ===
As of the current decade, major sporting events like the World Series, Super Bowl, World Cup, NBA Finals, and Olympic Games have been broadcast entirely live in all U.S. territories, encompassing both prime time hours of both U.S. coasts, simultaneous with the live global telecasts of these events in accordance with the official international broadcasters of such games.

Other events that air live all across U.S. territories include multi-network coverage of U.S. presidential and congressional elections, U.S. presidential inaugurations, the State of the Union Address, presidential news conferences, Presidential Addresses to the Nation, the Tournament of Roses Parade, and funerals of major national or international public and religious figures. Local television stations air live local election coverage and special events, such as large scale parades, big city marathons, funerals of major local public and religious figures, inauguration ceremonies of big city mayors and governors, installation masses of cardinals or bishops in a major Catholic archdiocese, and pep rallies for a major sports team. In the UK, events such as the State Opening of Parliament are broadcast live.

==Uses of live television==
Live television is often used as a device, even in scripted programming to take advantage of these often to great success in terms of attracting viewers. The NBC live comedy/variety program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, for example, has been on that network continuously since 1975 and airs live in the Eastern and Central zones (including the Pacific and Mountain zones beginning 2017 in its transition to its first live season all across the continental U.S. beginning 2018) during the show&#x27;s season which runs from October though May.

On September 25, 1997, NBC aired two separate live broadcasts (for viewers in both U.S. coasts) of an episode of &quot;ER&quot;, which at the time was the most watched U.S. television program overall. Many television news programs, particularly local news ones in North America, have also used live television as a device to gain audience viewers by making their programs appear more exciting. With technologies such as production trucks, satellite truck uplinks, a news reporter can report live &quot;on location&quot; from anywhere where a story is happening in the city. This technique has attracted criticism for its overuse (like minor car accidents which often have no injuries) and resulting tendency to make stories appear more urgent than they actually are.

The unedited nature of live television can pose problems for broadcasters because of the potential for mishaps, such as anchors being interrupted or harassed by bystanders shouting profane phrases. In 2015, a female CityNews journalist confronted a group of young men who had used such a phrase; one of them later lost his job after he was identified. Channels often broadcast live programs on a slight delay (usually of less than ten seconds) to give them the ability to censor words and images while keeping the broadcast as &quot;live&quot; as possible.

==Notable events on live television==
Many events have happened on live television broadcasts that are well-remembered, sometimes because they were part of a major breaking news story already, and always because they happened unexpectedly and before audiences of thousands or millions of viewers.

He later described the incident as a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. The incident caused outrage among religious groups and demands for the FCC to crack down on in decency on television and radio. It resulted in broadcast television networks imposing a seven-second delay on all future live programming.
* April 21, 2004 – After commenting on a UEFA Champions League match on ITV1, Ron Atkinson thought that the broadcast had finished. However, although transmission in the UK had finished, he was still on air to various countries in the Middle East and proceeded to say that &quot;... he is what is known in some schools as a fucking lazy thick nigger&quot; towards Marcel Desailly.

Although all programs were once live, the use of video tape means that very few television programs in the modern era have ever attempted such a feat. In the U.S., soap operas including &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; were broadcast live until 1975.

On rare occasions, a scripted series will do an episode live to attract ratings. In the U.S. and Canada, the episode is occasionally performed twice: once for the east coast which is composed of the Eastern Time Zone and Central Time Zone and again three hours later for the west coast which is composed of the Mountain Time Zone and the Pacific Time Zone unless they have Dish Network or Direct TV who provides the live feed in all states. The most recent scripted series to air all live episodes was &quot;Undateable&quot; on NBC during its third season, which aired from October 2015 until January 2016.

In the case of soap operas, they usually broadcast live episodes to celebrate a milestone anniversary.

Notable examples of shows that have had a live episode include:

*&quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; (1985)
*&quot;Roc&quot; (The entire second season, 1993)

Since 2000, there have been a number of special films broadcast live. These include the remakes of &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (2005). Some recent examples of live episodic TV series include shows such as &quot;Melissa and Joey&quot; (2010), &quot;Whitney&quot; (2011) and &quot;Undateable&quot; (2014).

A live television advertisement was shown for the first time in 40 years to celebrate the arrival of the new Honda Accord in the United Kingdom. It was broadcast on Channel Four on 29 May 2008 at 20:10 during a special episode of &quot;Come Dine With Me&quot;. The ad featured skydivers forming the letters of the word Honda over Spain.

==Live television specials==
Many live television specials were telecast during the pre-videotape era. Among the most successful were the 1955 and 1956 telecasts of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, a 1954 musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1904 play, starring Mary Martin, and Cyril Ritchard. This was such a hit that the show was restaged and rebroadcast (this time on videotape) with the same two stars and most of the rest of the cast in 1960, and rerun several times after that. The &quot;Peter Pan&quot; telecasts marked the first-ever telecasts of a complete Broadway musical with most of its original cast.

On December 5, 2013, NBC broadcast a live television special called &quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot; starring Carrie Underwood. This program aired live in the Eastern and Central time zones, and was the first television musical special to air live on NBC in almost fifty years. On January 31, 2016, Fox became the first non-Big Three American network to produce a musical special when it aired the television adaptation of &quot;Grease&quot; live in the Eastern and Central time zones.

<text>The Knife River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 120 mi (193 km) long, in North Dakota in the United States.

Knife is an English translation of the Native American name.

It rises in west central North Dakota, in the Killdeer Mountains in Dunn County. It flows east, and is joined by Spring Creek near Beulah. It joins the Missouri north of Stanton, at the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site.

Much of the terrain surrounding the river valley still remains in native grasslands, supporting many species of wildlife, including Whitetail Deer, Mule Deer, Coyote, Fox, Native Grouse, Pheasant, etc. Many of the small tributaries such as the Little Knife support local farms and ranches; some have been family owned for over 100 years. Some of the larger ranches include the Circle Five Ranch, Dressler Ranch, Perhus Bros. Ranch, and Greenshield Ranch.

The river consistently floods after spring melting (frequently as high as 10,000 cfs) but is two to three magnitudes lower during the summer months. The confluence of the river (near Stanton, ND) was largely blocked by sand after the Missouri River flood of 2011 but had cut a new channel by the summer of 2012. At Hazen, the river&#x27;s discharge averages 171 cubic feet per second.

<doc id="538875" wikidata="Q7346817" url="?curid=538875" title="Robert Lee Morris">
<text>Robert Lee Morris (born 1947) is an American jewelry designer and sculptor, who attributes much of his inspiration to organic forms he admires in nature and to designing for an imaginary futuristic society. His designs have been made in gold, silver and bronze and he is known for his 24 carat matte gold plating and rich deep red copper and green patina. He has collaborated or designed collections for fashion designers Geoffrey Beene, Kansai Yamamoto, Calvin Klein, Anne Klein, Karl Lagerfeld, Michael Kors and Donna Karan. Morris was awarded the Coty Award (1981) and the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award by the CFDA Awards (2007).

== Early life and education ==
He was born in 1947 in Nuremberg, Germany, where his parents were stationed after the end of World War II. His father was in the US Air Force. They were also stationed in Japan when he was nine for four years and later in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He graduated from Beloit College with honors in 1969. In early adulthood he eventually settled down in Bellows Falls, Vermont, living on a commune and learning about metal working.

Morris was discovered in 1971 by New York gallery owner Joan Sonnabend and first exhibited his work at her art jewelry outpost in the Plaza Hotel called, &quot;Sculpture to Wear&quot;.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Artwear Gallery&quot; ===
Shortly after the closing of &quot;Sculpture to Wear&quot; in 1977, he opened the first edition of &quot;Artwear Gallery&quot; at 28 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side, near the couture district on Madison Avenue. &quot;Artwear Gallery&quot; relocated to SoHo in August 1978 where it would be surrounded by contemporary art galleries. The new location also gained new celebrity clientele, including Issey Miyake, Geoffrey Beene, Madonna, Cher, Bianca Jagger, Janet Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, among others. Jewelry designers shown at &quot;Artwear Gallery&quot;, besides Morris included Ted Muehling and Cara Croninger. Morris own jewelry work in the 1980s was known as, &quot;modern urban warrior pieces&quot; and tapped into primitivism.

=== Other work ===
A few years later a second, larger location opened nearby, followed by another on Madison Avenue in what is now the Sony building. A location on Königsallee in Düsseldorf, Germany was short-lived. Morris closed Artwear in 1995 and the RLM Robert Lee Morris Gallery opened in September 1995 at 400 West Broadway, focusing exclusively on Morris&#x27;s own work.

His career took off after he appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1976. His work has appeared in over a dozen issues Vogue magazines.

In 1985 he worked with fashion designer Donna Karan for her first collection, they paired Karan&#x27;s sleek, monochromatic, luxurious fabric clothing designs with his organic, oversized, and sculptural gold jewelry. He has collaborated with many leading fashion designers, including Geoffrey Beene, Karl Lagerfeld, Kansai Yamamoto, Calvin Klein, Anne Klein, and Michael Kors. Morris has designed Karan&#x27;s perfume bottle, &quot;Gold&quot; for Estée Lauder. He also designed a special edition lipstick and compact for Elizabeth Arden in 1990.

In the 1990s through the 2000s, Morris created a fine jewelry line called &quot;RLM Collection&quot; on QVC. He has a presence on QVC television, selling RLM Studio, designed exclusively for QVC.

In 2007, Morris was the first jewelry designer to be awarded the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). He won the Coty Award in 1981 for his collection for Calvin Klein. He has received two other CFDA Awards for accessory design, in 1985 and 1994.

In 2008, Morris developed a jewelry collection for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen&#x27;s clothing line, Elizabeth &amp; James.

In 2011, Manhattan-based, Haskell Jewels, LLC announced its acquisition of Robert Lee Morris.

Morris launched his Soho line at national department stores in September 2012. His higher end Collection line was launched in September 2012 at fine retailers nationwide. The Collection launched with Morris&#x27;s first national ad campaign in American fashion magazines, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;W&quot; Magazine and &quot;Elle&quot;. 

In 2017, MAC Cosmetics collaborated with Morris on a limited collection of products.

<doc id="538876" wikidata="Q2706259" url="?curid=538876" title="Richard Cumberland (philosopher)">
<text>Richard Cumberland (15 July 1631 (or 1632) – 9 October 1718) was an English philosopher, and Bishop of Peterborough from 1691. In 1672, he published his major work, &quot;De legibus naturae&quot; (&quot;On natural laws&quot;), propounding utilitarianism and opposing the egoistic ethics of Thomas Hobbes. 
Cumberland was a member of the Latitudinarian movement, along with his friend Hezekiah Burton of Magdalene College, Cambridge and closely allied with the Cambridge Platonists, a group of ecclesiastical philosophers centred on Cambridge University in the mid 17th century.

==Early life==
He was born in the parish of St Ann, near Aldersgate, where his father was a tailor. He was educated in St Paul&#x27;s School, where Samuel Pepys was a friend, and from 1649 at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he obtained a fellowship. He took the degree of BA in 1653; and, having proceeded to the MA in 1656, was incorporated the following year into the same degree in the University of Oxford.

For some time he studied medicine; and although he did not adhere to this profession, he retained his knowledge of anatomy and medicine. He took the degree of BD in 1663 and that of DD in 1680. Among his contemporaries and intimate friends were Hezekiah Burton, Sir Samuel Morland, who was distinguished as a mathematician, and Orlando Bridgeman, who became Lord Keeper of the Great Seal.

Cumberland&#x27;s first preferment, bestowed upon him in 1658 by Sir John Norwich of the Rump Parliament, was the rectory of Brampton Ash in Northamptonshire. In 1661 he was appointed one of the twelve preachers of the university. The Lord Keeper, who obtained his office in 1667, invited him to London, and in 1670 secured for him the rectory of All Saints at Stamford. In this year Cumberland married Anne Quinsey. He acquired credit by the fidelity with which he discharged his duties. In addition to his ordinary work he undertook the weekly lecture.

==&quot;De legibus naturae&quot;==
In 1672, at the age of forty, he published his earliest work, entitled &quot;De legibus naturae&quot;. It is dedicated to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, and is prefaced by an &quot;Alloquium ad Lectorem,&quot; contributed by Hezekiah Burton. It appeared during the same year as Pufendorf&#x27;s &quot;De jure naturae et gentium&quot;, and was highly commended in a subsequent publication by Pufendorf. Stephen Darwall writes that

&quot;the Treatise was regarded as one of the three great works of the modern natural law tradition&quot;,

the others being Grotius&#x27;s &quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot;, and Pufendorf&#x27;s &quot;De jure naturae&quot;. It has been described as a

&quot;restatement of the doctrine of the law of nature as furnishing the ground of the obligation of all the moral virtues. The work is heavy in style, and its philosophical analysis lacks thoroughness; but its insistence on the social nature of man, and its doctrine of the common good as the supreme law of morality, anticipate the direction taken by much of the ethical thought of the following century.&quot; (From &quot;The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907–21)&quot;.)

English translations of the treatise were published in 1692, by James Tyrrell, and 1727, by John Maxwell.

==Other works==
Cumberland next wrote &quot;An Essay towards the Recovery of the Jewish Measures and Weights&quot; (1686). This work, dedicated to Pepys, obtained a copious notice from Jean Leclerc, and was translated into French.

About this period he was apprehensive about the rise of Catholic influence. &quot;Sanchoniatho&#x27;s Phoenician History&quot;, on the author usually now known as Sanchuniathon, was translated from the first book of Eusebius.
According to Parkin, Cumberland&#x27;s work was in an anti-Catholic vein, accounting for its posthumous appearance. His domestic chaplain and son-in-law, Squier Payne, edited it for publication soon after the bishop&#x27;s death.

The preface contains an account by Payne of the life, character and writings of the author, published also in a separate form. A German translation by Johan Philip Cassel appeared under the title of &quot;Cumberlands phonizische Historie des Sanchoniathons&quot; (Magdeburg, 1755). The sequel to the work was likewise published by Payne: &quot;Origines gentium antiquissimae&quot; (1724).

==Later life==

One day in 1691 he went, according to his custom on a post-day, to read the newspaper at a coffee-house in Stamford, and there, to his surprise, he read that the king had nominated him to the bishopric of Peterborough. The bishop elect was scarcely known at court, and he had resorted to none of the usual methods of advancing his temporal interest. &quot;Being then sixty years old,&quot; says his great-grandson, &quot;he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the offer, when it came to him from authority. The persuasion of his friends, particularly Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at length overcame his repugnance; and to that see, though very moderately endowed, he for ever after devoted himself, and resisted every offer of translation, though repeatedly made and earnestly recommended. To such of his friends as pressed an exchange upon him he was accustomed to reply, that Peterborough was his first espoused, and should be his only one.&quot; He discharged his new duties with energy and kept up his episcopal visitations till his eightieth year.

His charges to the clergy are described as plain and unambitious, the earnest breathings of a pious mind. When David Wilkins published the New Testament in Coptic (&quot;Novum Testamentum Aegyptium, vulgo Copticum&quot;, 1716) he presented a copy to the bishop, who began to study the language at the age of eighty-three. &quot;At this age,&quot; says his chaplain, &quot;he mastered the language, and went through great part of this version, and would often give me excellent hints and remarks, as he proceeded in reading of it.&quot;

He died on 8 October 1718, in the eighty-seventh year of his age; he was found sitting in his library, in the attitude of one asleep, and with a book in his hand. He was buried in Peterborough Cathedral the following day. The grave lies at the east end in a group of floor stones dedicated to the bishops.

His grandson was Denison Cumberland, who married Johanna (daughter of Richard Bentley), and his great-grandson was Richard Cumberland, the dramatist.

Bishop Cumberland was distinguished by his gentleness and humility. He could not be roused to anger, and spent his days in unbroken serenity. His favourite motto was that a man had better &quot;wear out than rust out.&quot;

==Philosophical views==
The philosophy of Cumberland is expounded in &quot;De legibus naturae&quot;. Its main design is to combat the principles which Hobbes had promulgated as to the constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to prove that self-advantage is not the chief end of man, that force is not the source of personal obligation to moral conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and that the state of nature is not a state of war. The views of Hobbes seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of religion, morality and civil society. He endeavours, as a rule, to establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from denunciation, and is a fair opponent up to the measure of his insight.

The basis of his ethical theory is . According to Parkin (p. 141)

&quot;The &quot;De legibus naturae&quot; is a book about how individuals can discover the precepts of natural law and the divine obligation which lies behind it. [...] Could, or should, natural philosophy claim to be able to reveal substantial information about the nature of God&#x27;s will, and also divine obligation? For writers who accepted a voluntarist and nominalist understanding of the relationship between God and man (both Cumberland and Hobbes), this was not an easy question to answer.&quot;

Darwall (p. 106) writes that Cumberland

&quot;follows Hobbes in attempting to provide a fully naturalistic account of the normative force of obligation and of the idea of a rational dictate, although he rejects Hobbes&#x27;s theory that these derive entirely from instrumental rationality.&quot;

===Laws of nature/natural laws===
Laws of nature are defined by him as

 &quot;immutably true propositions regulative of voluntary actions as to the choice of good and the avoidance of evil, and which carry with them an obligation to outward acts of obedience, even apart from civil laws and from any considerations of compacts constituting government.

This definition, he says, will be admitted by all parties. Some deny that such laws exist, but they will grant that this is what ought to be understood by them. There is thus common ground for the two opposing schools of moralists to join issue. The question between them is, Do such laws exist or do they not? In reasoning thus Cumberland obviously forgot what the position maintained by his principal antagonist really was.

Hobbes did not deny that there were laws of nature, laws antecedent to government, laws even in a sense eternal and immutable. The virtues as means to happiness seemed to him to be such laws. They precede civil constitution, which merely perfects the obligation to practise them. He expressly denied, however, that &quot;they carry with them an obligation to outward acts of obedience, even apart from civil laws and from any consideration of compacts constituting governments.&quot;

Many besides Hobbes must have felt dissatisfied with the definition. It is ambiguous and obscure. In what sense is a law of nature a &quot;proposition&quot;? Is it as the expression of a constant relation among facts, or is it as the expression of a divine commandment? A proposition is never in itself an ultimate fact although it may be the statement of such a fact. And in what sense is a law of nature an &quot;immutably true&quot; proposition? Is it so because men always and everywhere accept and act on it, or merely because they always and everywhere ought to accept and act on it? The definition, in fact, explains nothing.

The existence of such laws may, according to Cumberland, be established in two ways. The inquirer may start either from effects or from causes. The former method had been taken by Hugo Grotius, Robert Sharrock and John Selden. They had sought to prove that there were universal truths, entitled to be called laws of nature, from the concurrence of the testimonies of many men, peoples and ages, and through generalizing the operations of certain active principles. Cumberland admits this method to be valid, but he prefers the other, that from causes to effects, as showing more convincingly that the laws of nature carry with them a divine obligation. It shows not only that these laws are universal, but that they were intended as such; that man has been constituted as he is in order that they might be. In the prosecution of this method he expressly declines to have recourse to what he calls &quot;the short and easy expedient of the Platonists,&quot; the assumption of innate ideas of the laws of nature.

He thinks it ill-advised to build the doctrines of natural religion and morality on a hypothesis which many philosophers had rejected, and which could not be proved against Epicureans, the principal impugners of the existence of laws of nature. He cannot assume, he says, that such ideas existed from eternity in the divine mind, but must start from the data of sense and experience, and thence by search into the nature of things to discover their laws. It is only through nature that we can rise to nature&#x27;s God. His attributes are not to be known by direct intuition. He, therefore, held that the ground taken up by the Cambridge Platonists could not be maintained against Hobbes.

His sympathies, however, were all on their side, and he would do nothing to diminish their chances of success. He would not even oppose the doctrine of innate ideas, because it looked with a friendly eye upon piety and morality. He granted that it might, perhaps, be the case that ideas were both born with us and afterwards impressed upon us from without.

===Ethical theory===
Cumberland&#x27;s ethical theory is summed up in his principle of universal benevolence, the source of moral good. &quot;No action can be morally good which does not in its own nature contribute somewhat to the happiness of men.&quot;

Cumberland&#x27;s Benevolence is, deliberately, the precise antithesis to the egoism of Hobbes. Cumberland maintained that the whole-hearted pursuit of the good of all contributes to the good of each and brings personal happiness; that the opposite process involves misery to individuals including the self. Cumberland never appealed to the evidence of history, although he believed that the law of universal benevolence had been accepted by all nations and generations; and he abstains from arguments founded on revelation, feeling that it was indispensable to establish the principles of moral right on nature as a basis.

His method was the deduction of the propriety of certain actions from the consideration of the character and position of rational agents in the universe. He argues that all that we see in nature is framed so as to avoid and reject what is dangerous to the integrity of its constitution; that the human race would be an anomaly in the world had it not for end its conservation in its best estate; that benevolence of all to all is what in a rational view of the creation is alone accordant with its general plan; that various peculiarities of man&#x27;s body indicate that he has been made to co-operate with his fellow men and to maintain society; and that certain faculties of his mind show the common good to be more essentially connected with his perfection than any pursuit of private advantage. The whole course of his reasoning proceeds on, and is pervaded by, the principle of final causes.

===Utilitarianism===
He may be regarded as the founder of English utilitarianism. His utilitarianism is distinct from the individualism of some later utilitarians; it goes to the contrary extreme, by almost absorbing individual in universal good. To the question, &quot;What is the foundation of rectitude?,&quot; he replies, the greatest good of the universe of rational beings. This is a version of utilitarianism.

Nor does it look merely to the lower pleasures, the pleasures of sense, for the constituents of good, but rises above them to include especially what tends to perfect, strengthen and expand our true nature. Existence and the extension of our powers of body and mind are held to be good for their own sakes without respect to enjoyment.

Cumberland&#x27;s views on this point were long abandoned by utilitarians as destroying the homogeneity and self-consistency of their theory; but John Stuart Mill and some other writers have reproduced them as necessary to its defence against charges not less serious than even inconsistency. The answer which Cumberland gives to the question, &quot;Whence comes our obligation to observe the laws of nature?,&quot; is that happiness flows from obedience, and misery from disobedience to them, not as the mere results of a blind necessity, but as the expressions of the divine will.

===Reward and punishment===
Reward and punishment, supplemented by future retribution, are, in his view, the sanctions of the laws of nature, the sources of our obligation to obey them. To the other great ethical question, How are moral distinctions apprehended?, he replies that it is by means of right reason. But by right reason he means merely the power of rising to general laws of nature from particular facts of experience. It is no peculiar faculty or distinctive function of mind; it involves no original element of cognition; it begins with sense and experience; it is gradually generated and wholly derivative.

This doctrine lies only in germ in Cumberland, but will be found in full flower in Hartley, Mackintosh and later associationists.

<text>Today&#x27;s Best Hits was an American radio network with a Hot Adult Contemporary format. It played many contemporary songs. It also featured many retro (1980s) hits, and on Saturday night, it played only requested retro songs. The network was previously known as Best Hits, Best Variety. Today&#x27;s Best Hits was a property of Cumulus Media Networks (now Westwood One).

&quot;Retro Radio&quot;, the first nationwide radio broadcast devoted solely to music from the 1980s, was launched on Saturday nights in 1997. The show was created and hosted by Thom &quot;Booray&quot; Daniels until 2000. The format was dissolved as Cumulus Media Networks merged with Westwood One, as there was already a &quot;Hot AC&quot; satellite-fed format provided by that network.

<doc id="538880" wikidata="Q3203833" url="?curid=538880" title="The Man Who Folded Himself">
<text>The Man Who Folded Himself is a 1973 science fiction novel by American writer David Gerrold. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1974 and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1974. The book explores the psychological, physical, and personal challenges that manifest when time travel is possible for a single individual at the touch of a button.

==Plot summary==
In 1975, Daniel Eakins, a young college student, is visited by his Uncle Jim. Uncle Jim offers to increase Daniel&#x27;s monthly allowance for living expenses as long as Daniel promises to keep a diary. Shortly after, Uncle Jim dies, and Daniel inherits a &quot;Time-belt&quot; from him that allows the wearer to easily travel through time. Daniel quickly learns how to use the Time-belt and makes a few short jumps into his own future. He meets a future version of himself, who goes by &quot;Don&quot;, who accompanies him to a race-track where the pair make a fortune betting on horse-racing.

The following day, Daniel realises that it is his turn to act as Don and guide his younger self through the previous day at the races; through this and other events the time-travelling Daniel learns more about the belt, about the nature of the &quot;timestream,&quot; and about his personal identity.

Daniel repeatedly encounters alternate versions of himself, sometimes known as Don, and enjoys his own company, ultimately having sex with himself and beginning a relationship with himself. He learns that the changes he has made to his timeline have erased all traces of his childhood and early life.

Though Daniel has been able to become closer to himself than he has in any other relationship, at some point he comes to find that he no longer meets other versions of himself. Lonely and hoping to correct the situation, he jumps many millennia backwards in time, where his jumps have not altered the timeline, and there he meets a female version of himself called &quot;Diane&quot;. Diane&#x27;s future is a mirror of Daniel&#x27;s—she was given the Time-belt by her Aunt Jane, and she had also begun a relationship with her other selves, called Donna. Daniel begins a relationship with Diane and Diane becomes pregnant.

Daniel and Diane each secretly desire a son and a daughter, respectively, and unbeknownst to each other each uses technology from the future to make their own changes to ensure that Diane gives birth to a child with the desired gender. Shortly after the birth of their child, Daniel and Diane separate.

Daniel raises his son in 1950s America. As Daniel ages, he misses the relationship he had with Diane, but the interference of an obsessive, deranged version of himself has erased the point in the past where the two can meet. Daniel spends much of his time at a house party set in 1999, enjoying the company of dozens of versions of himself at different ages. At one point late in the party an elderly version of Daniel dies after a jump, and Daniel is consumed with the thought of his own inevitable death.

Daniel eventually realizes that he has now become his Uncle Jim, and that his son will grow up to be the young version of himself who will inherit the Time-belt, and that his life has &quot;come full circle.&quot; He makes preparations for after his death to ensure that the young Daniel experiences the same events that Daniel did and has his own experiences with time travel.

The book ends with a young Daniel, who has read the now-complete diary, having to decide whether he will use the Time-belt.

==Updated edition==
Mentions were added in the 2003 edition of both the American Airlines Flight 191 crash in May 1979 and the destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, events which did not occur until 6 years and 28 years respectively after initial publication in 1973.

==Characters==
Almost all of the different characters in the story are, in fact, alternate versions of Daniel from another point in time.

When Daniel first meets his future self from one day into the future, the future version identifies himself as &quot;Don,&quot; ostensibly Daniel&#x27;s twin brother. The next day, when it becomes Dan&#x27;s turn to meet a version of himself from yesterday, he adopts the role of Don. (When a third Daniel appears, he is sometimes identified as Don II, or &quot;ultra-Don&quot;.)

The female version of Danny has a similar relationship with alternate versions of herself; she is Diane when she meets a version of herself from the future, but when she plays the role of the future traveler she adopts the name Donna. Diane has an Aunt Jane, who is the elderly version of herself, and the female equivalent of Danny&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Jim&quot;.

After Daniel and Diane find out about Diane&#x27;s pregnancy, each respectively desires a son and a daughter who is exactly like them. Unbeknownst to each other, they both obtain future technology to make their own changes, that ensure that Diane gives birth to the desired child. The contrary changes create a split between their timelines, in which they have either a son or daughter, and after their separation take the child of their own sex back to their own future, creating the closed time loops of the man and the woman.

The only named character who is &quot;not&quot; some version of Daniel is a lawyer who calls him on the phone to tell him of his Uncle Jim&#x27;s death, and the lawyer is vaguely identified as &quot;Biggs-or-Briggs-or-something&quot;.

==Critical reception from science fiction authors==
Reviewing the novel in 1974 for &quot;Vector&quot;, Christopher Priest thought that Gerrold had unintentionally replicated the closed-loop timelines of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s short stories &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot; (1941) and —All You Zombies— (1959, also featuring a protagonist who becomes his own parents), only less successfully. Priest commented that while it was &quot;a polished, readable, clever book... [it lacks] even the most rudimentary forms of characterisation, subtlety, description or originality... is he going to get a Nebula? Probably.&quot;
Douglas Lain commented in 2012 that &quot;The most interesting and perhaps most overlooked move that David Gerrold makes in his fractal time travel book &quot;The Man Who Folded Himself&quot; is that he writes the whole story in the second person without alerting you, the reader, directly to this fact.&quot; S. L. Huang wrote in 2019 that &quot;The book folds in on itself like a fabulous origami of paradoxes that somehow make sense... It is one of the best time-travel stories I have ever seen... It is also very queer.&quot;

<text>The University of Denver (DU) is a private research university in Denver, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1864, it has an enrollment of approximately 5,700 undergraduate students and 7,200 graduate students. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The main campus is a designated arboretum and is located five miles (8 km) south of downtown Denver.

== History ==
In March 1864, John Evans, former governor of the Colorado Territory, appointee of President Abraham Lincoln, founded the Colorado Seminary in the newly created (1858) city of Denver, which was then a mining camp. Evans, governor and superintendent of Indian affairs of the Colorado Territory, lost his government position as a result of the November 1864 Sand Creek massacre (which was carried out by Colonel John Chivington, later a member of the Colorado Seminary&#x27;s Trustees).

At its founding the seminary was non-sectarian and operated by the Methodist Episcopal Church. It struggled in the early years of its existence. In 1880, it was renamed the University of Denver. The first buildings of the university were located in downtown Denver in the 1860s and 1870s, but concerns that Denver&#x27;s rough-and-tumble frontier town atmosphere was not conducive to education prompted a relocation to the current campus, built on the donated land of potato farmer Rufus Clark, some six miles (11 km) south of the downtown core. The university grew and prospered alongside the city&#x27;s growth, appealing primarily to a regional student body prior to World War II. After the war, the large surge in G.I. Bill students pushed DU&#x27;s enrollment to over 13,000 students, the largest the university has ever been, and helped to spread the university&#x27;s reputation to a national audience.

==Campus==
The heart of the campus has a number of historic buildings. The longest-standing building is University Hall, which has served DU since 1890, and was built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Just a few blocks off campus sits the historic Chamberlin Observatory, opened in 1894. Still a fully operational observatory, it is open to the public twice a week as well as one Saturday a month.
The central campus area also includes Evans Memorial Chapel, an 1870s-vintage small church which was once located in downtown Denver, and was relocated to the DU campus in the early 1960s. Buchtel Tower (1913) is all that remains of the former Buchtel Chapel, which burned in 1983.
The administrative offices are located in the Mary Reed Building, a former library built in 1932 in the Collegiate Gothic style. Margery Reed Hall (named for the daughter of Mary Reed) was also built in the collegiate gothic style in 1929. Margery Reed Hall houses the Undergraduate Program for the Daniels College of Business; an $8 million overhaul and renovation was completed early 2014. The building was updated to include more classroom space, a larger hall to host guest speakers, as well as mechanical and technical improvements.

F.W. Olin Hall opened in 1997, housing Biological and Natural Sciences. The 40,000 square foot structure was the first building on campus constructed to meet a new set of design and aesthetic standards emphasizing load-bearing masonry, organic designs, and timeless architectural features. Olin Hall includes a two-story rotunda topped with an elliptical copper dome, a sentinel in the university skyline.

The Daniels College of Business was completed in September 1999 at the cost of $25 million. The business school has been nationally recognized by organizations such as &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, &quot;Business Week&quot;, and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; where it is ranked second in the nation for producing students with high ethical standards.

In 2002, the university opened the $70 million Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts, which houses the acclaimed Lamont School of Music. The center includes the June Swaner Gates Concert Hall, a four-level opera house seating just under 1,000, the Frederic C. Hamilton Family Recital Hall, a 222-seat recital hall with the largest (2,850 pipes) &quot;tracker&quot; organ in the region, and the Elizabeth Ericksen Byron Theatre, a flexible theatre space seating up to 350. The Newman Center serves as home to many professional performing arts groups from the Denver region as well as the university&#x27;s &quot;Newman Center Presents&quot; multi-disciplinary performing arts series.

Nelson Hall, opened in 2002, is a LEED residence hall housing sophomores in dorm- and apartment-style suites. Its castle-like design and gold leaf-topped tower anchors the south end of campus.

In autumn 2003, DU opened a new $63.5 million facility for its College of Law, later named the &quot;Sturm College of Law.&quot; Donald and Susan Sturm, owners of Denver-based American National Bank, had given $20 million to the University of Denver College of Law. The gift is the largest single donation in the 112-year history of the law school and among the largest gifts ever to the university. The building includes a three-story library.

In 2005 the Graduate School of Social Work completed the renovation and significant expansion of its building, renamed Craig Hall. The building features extensive stained glass artwork and a large events space.
In January 2006, DU opened a new building for the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management (Fritz Knoebel School of Hospitality Management), later named the Joy Burns Center. The building contains classrooms, a large wine cellar, meeting rooms, and an all-purpose dining room that hosts numerous city and university events, weddings, and formal parties. The school helps DU rank near the top of all hotel schools in the United States. The program had its first graduating class in 1946.

Nagel Hall, a five-story 150,000 square foot residence hall, whose distinguishing characteristic is a tower topped by a 12-ton copper-clad cone, was completed in the Fall of 2008 to accommodate sophomores and upperclassman. The project was partially funded by a 30-year $45.7 million revenue bond and a $4 million donation from DU Trustee Ralph Nagel and his wife Trish. Nagel Hall also houses works donated from the Nagels&#x27; art collection, with over 50 paintings from Colorado artists including many by Ralph Nagel himself. In 2012, the building was certified Gold in LEED standards in recognition of its environmentally friendly and sustainable design. The building also houses offices for the Department of Psychology and a bike repair shop in its lower level.

DU completed the first ever (Peter S. Barton) lacrosse-only stadium that was specifically designed for the sport in 2005, as well as the Ciber Field Soccer Stadium (2010) on the northern end of campus, adjoining the Nagel studio space for the School of Art, as well as the Pat Bowlen varsity sports weight training facility underneath the stands.

The environmentally friendly $25 million Morgridge College of Education was opened in June 2010.

At the beginning of the summer of 2011, the 41-year-old Penrose Library closed for a $32 million renovation, and reopened in the spring of 2013 as the Anderson Academic Commons, a 21st-century high-tech collaboration and study space.

In May 2016, the 47,000 square foot Anna &amp; John J. Sie International Relations Complex opened as an addition to Cherrington Hall. The addition rises five stories, and includes classrooms, offices, and an expansive event space and deck on the fifth floor. The building also features a blue-tiled tower prominent in the university&#x27;s skyline.

In 2016, the university opened the 130,000 square foot Daniel Felix Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science on the southern end of campus, adjacent to Olin Hall. The building features classroom, laboratory, and office spaces for faculty, as well as a cafe on the first floor. The structure is notable for its zinc and limestone dome rising five floors above the main entrance.

In 2018, then-Chancellor Rebecca Chopp and university architect Mark Rodgers introduced the Denver Advantage Campus Framework Plan, which aimed to provide a path forward for the university&#x27;s physical campus.

In September 2020, the Dimond Family Residential Village opened to house first-year students, and the Burwell Center for Career Achievement opened to house alumni engagement and career services offices, replacing the Leo Block Alumni Center. Both are on track to achieve LEED certification and are the first structures completed under the Denver Advantage Campus Framework Plan.

In October 2021, the establishment of the James C. Kennedy Mountain Campus was announced with a $26 million gift from a university alumnus.

DU&#x27;s Office of International Education also offers to their students support and advice for all undergraduate students who want to study abroad.

=== Magazine ===
The &quot;University of Denver Magazine&quot; is published quarterly. 

The &quot;Denver Quarterly&quot; was founded in 1966 by novelist John Edward Williams.

== Fraternities and sororities ==
The University of Denver has hosted fraternities and sororities for over 130 years. 

==Athletics==

DU&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Denver Pioneers. The school has been fielding athletic teams since 1867, winning 35 NCAA Division One titles since 1949—among the top 15 of all schools. Denver is best known as a major power in winter sports, in particular, skiing and ice hockey. DU has won 24 NCAA national team skiing championships (more than any other school). Ice hockey is DU&#x27;s flagship spectator sport, with 10 NCAA titles (first among all schools), most recently in 2024 and including back-to-back crowns in 2004 and 2005. The program has produced 75 NHL players and regularly sells out the 6,000 seat Magness Arena on campus, the showpiece of the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness.
The Pioneers&#x27; major conference affiliations changed in July 2013. Denver moved its primary affiliation from the Western Athletic Conference to The Summit League, hockey moved from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association to the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, and men&#x27;s lacrosse moved from the ECAC Lacrosse League to the Big East Conference. The women&#x27;s lacrosse team also moved from the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) to the Big East Conference in 2017 and in 2019 they reached the Elite 8 (quarterfinals) of the NCAA tournament. In addition, the women&#x27;s gymnastics team joined the newly formed Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference in 2013 and later moved to the Big 12 Conference in July 2015.

===Pioneers moniker controversy===
The school has used the Pioneers nickname since 1925 after previously being known at the Fighting Parsons or Fighting Ministers (1919-1925). Under the Pioneers moniker, DU athletic teams have had the following mascots: Pioneer Pete (1925 to 1968), Denver Boone (1968 to 1998), Ruckus the red-tailed hawk (1999 to 2007), and since 2008, the school has been without an official mascot. Denver Boone first fell into controversy in 1984 when university administrators began to phase out the Daniel Boone-inspired mascot due to &quot;male gender stereotyping and its specifically western symbolism&quot;. By 1999, the transition away from Boone was complete with the unveiling of Ruckus by Chancellor Daniel Ritchie. Ruckus was eventually phased out in 2008 after failing to gain traction with students, student-athletes, and alumni. In 2013, a task force was formed to generate three new mascot options - a jackrabbit, an elk, or a mountaineer - under the Pioneers moniker. Although a survey found 70% of respondents would be receptive or neutral on a new mascot, respondents did not coalesce around any option to merit selection.

Despite the removal of Denver Boone as the official mascot, the university maintains Pioneers as the moniker for its athletics and general university representation. The use of the Pioneers moniker has generated controversy among faculty, staff, and students. The university founder territorial governor John Evans was found culpable in the Sand Creek massacre. In November 1864, US Cavalry attacked the Cheyenne and Arapahoe people at a site near Eads, in Southeastern Colorado, killing mostly women, children, and elders. DU has deep ties to the Sand Creek Massacre. Not only was John Evans the founder of the university, Colonel John Chivington who led the attack was also one of the early donors and Board of Trustees members. In 2014, the DU John Evans Study Committee Report was produced and found Evans culpable for the massacre, given his &quot;aggressively anti-Native rhetoric and actions leading up to the massacre&quot;.

The scholars on the DU Evans Committee recommended removing the Pioneers moniker, as it glorified the violent legacy of settler colonialism that was specifically perpetrated against Native peoples in the area. Since the university is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, the report argues that removing this horrific reminder is necessary: &quot;Instead of asking Native community members whose ancestors were sacrificed before the march of American settler pioneers to sacrifice yet again for the sake of our &#x27;brand,&#x27; the University of Denver should finally lay the Pioneer moniker to rest.&quot;

In 2016 and 2017, some students demanded change from the university administration. In October 2017, the Native Student Alliance organization started the #NoMorePios movement. During the civil rights uprising in summer 2020, a new student group called Righteous Anger! Healing Resistance! came together to demand the removal of the Pioneers moniker and other actions that would support students from marginalized communities.

Fierce resistance to removing the moniker came from students, fans, and alumni who are attached to the name. They have been supported by Chancellor Haefner, who made a final decision to keep the moniker.

<doc id="538890" wikidata="Q29477" url="?curid=538890" title="Devil's food cake">
<text>Devil&#x27;s food cake is a moist, rich chocolate layer cake. 

Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the 20th century, it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil&#x27;s food from the more standard chocolate cake. However, it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake, making it darker in color and with a heavier texture. 

Devil&#x27;s food cake was invented in the United States in the early 20th century.

==Ingredients==
Devil&#x27;s food cake traditionally uses unsweetened chocolate baking squares in lieu of unsweetened cocoa powder. However, contemporary recipes typically use cocoa powder for its convenience over the more traditional chocolate baking squares. Also, because of its reduced amount of cocoa butter, cocoa powder has a more intense chocolate flavor than unsweetened chocolate. Moreover, coffee is frequently added as a liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor. Some recipes use hot or boiling water as the cake&#x27;s main liquid, rather than milk. Its antithetical counterpart, the angel food cake, is a very light white cake that uses stiffly beaten egg whites and no dairy.

Devil&#x27;s food cake is sometimes distinguished from other chocolate cakes by the use of additional baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), which raises the pH level and makes the cake a deeper and darker mahogany color. Devil&#x27;s food cake incorporates butter (or a substitute), flour, and less egg than other chocolate cakes.

== Presentation ==
The cake is often paired with a rich chocolate frosting. 

== History ==
Recipes for devil&#x27;s food cakes appeared in two cookbooks published in 1902. Chocolate cake had become popular in the late 19th century, eventually leading toward development of devil&#x27;s food cake.

The name probably had several sources of inspiration, including the culinary term to describe flavorful foods like deviled eggs and the contrast of this dark, dense, flavorful cake with the light and airy angel food cake. The name has inspired humorous comments; one of the first printed recipes declares it to be &quot;Fit for Angels&quot;, and another early recipe recommends topping it with divinity frosting.

The first commercial cake mix for devil&#x27;s food cake was marketed by P. Duff and Sons, Inc. of Pennsylvania in the 1930s.

The Heart River rises in the prairie country of Billings County, in the Little Missouri National Grassland near the south unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It flows generally eastwardly through Stark County to Gladstone, past Belfield and South Heart, through the Patterson Reservoir and past Dickinson.

It is joined by the Green River at Gladstone, and turns east-southeastward into Grant County, passing through Lake Tschida, which is formed by the Heart Butte Dam. Below this dam, the river turns northeastward into Morton County, where it joins the Missouri River at Mandan.

<doc id="538901" wikidata="Q3052933" url="?curid=538901" title="Antiques Roadshow">
<text>Antiques Roadshow is a British television programme broadcast by the BBC in which antiques appraisers travel to various regions of the United Kingdom (and occasionally in other countries) to appraise antiques brought in by local people (generally speaking). It has been running since 1979, based on a 1977 documentary programme.

The series has spawned many international versions throughout Europe, North America and other countries with the same TV format. The programme is hosted by Fiona Bruce and in 2024 was in its 47th series.

== History ==
The programme began as a BBC documentary that aired in 1977, about a London auction house doing a tour of the West Country in England. The pilot roadshow was recorded in Hereford on 17 May 1977 and presented by contributor Bruce Parker, a presenter of the news/current affairs programme &quot;Nationwide&quot;, and antiques expert Arthur Negus, who had previously worked on a similarly themed show, called &quot;Going for a Song&quot;. The pilot was so successful that it was transmitted. The show has been running since 1979 and the format has remained almost unchanged ever since, though fewer and fewer antiques are featured in recent series, being replaced with Lego, Barbie Dolls, modern ceramics, Star Wars and other film memorabilia. Negus appeared on &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; until 1983. In the original BBC programme, various towns or famous places are advertised as venues. The show has since visited a number of other countries (including Canada in 2001 and Australia in 2005) and has been imitated by other TV production companies around the world.

In the United Kingdom, annual children&#x27;s Christmas specials aired from 1991 until 2006, under the title &quot;Antiques Roadshow: The Next Generation&quot; (except for the 1991 edition, which was titled &quot;Antiques Roadshow Going Live&quot;) and used a specially reworked version of the regular theme music. However, there was no children&#x27;s special in 2007; instead an edition was devoted to &quot;antiques of the future&quot; dating from the 1950s to the present day. Since then individually themed specials have been aired, though not every year.

A spin-off programme, &quot;20th Century Roadshow&quot;, focusing on modern collectibles, aired between April and June 2005. It was hosted by Alan Titchmarsh. Two other spin-off programmes, &quot;Antiques Roadshow Gems&quot; (1991) and &quot;Priceless Antiques Roadshow&quot; (2009–10), revisited items from the show&#x27;s history and provided background information on the making of the show and interviews with the programme&#x27;s experts.

The most valuable item to ever appear on the show featured on 16 November 2008. This was an original 1990s maquette of the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; sculpture by Antony Gormley, owned by Gateshead Council, which was valued at £1,000,000 by Philip Mould. Glassware expert Andy McConnell later valued a collection of chandeliers at seven million pounds (their actual insurance value), noting as he did so that this beat Mould&#x27;s record; however these were fixtures of the building in which the show was being filmed (Bath Assembly Rooms) rather than an item that had been brought in. In reality, the two most expensive objects to be sold as a result of being discovered on the show are the 1932 camera found by Marc Allum, which realised over $600,000 (US) in 2013 and the Christofle et Cie Japonisme jardiniere filmed by Eric Knowles, which sold for £668,450 (including buyers premium).

Conversely, many items brought before the experts are without commercial value, if not outright counterfeits. They are seldom shown in the broadcast episodes, to spare embarrassment for the individuals involved, although counterfeit objects are sometimes included, to give experts an opportunity to explain the difference between real and fake items. Value is not the only criterion for inclusion; items with an interesting story attached, or of a provenance relevant to the show&#x27;s location, will often be featured regardless of value. Items directly related to The Holocaust may have their stories featured, but are not given valuations. An episode commemorating the end of the First World War and featuring personal mementoes, included no valuations. All items are appraised, although most appraisals take place off-camera, with only the most promising items (around 50 on an average day) being filmed, of which about 20 appear in the final programme.

Some significant items have been acquired by museums after being sold once their owners were appraised of their true value. An example is the watercolour painting &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Halt in the Desert&quot; by Richard Dadd, discovered and shown by Peter Nahum in 1986 and purchased the next year by the British Museum for £100,000. Another such item, later dubbed &quot;Ozzy the Owl&quot;, is a Staffordshire slipware jug, valued by Henry Sandon on a 1990 show at £20,000 to £30,000, and subsequently acquired by Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery.

The original theme music was Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 (for several years in a Moog synthesiser version by Wendy Carlos), but was changed in the early 1990s to an original piece. This theme was written by Paul Reade and Tim Gibson and published by Air Edel.

In March 2023, for an edition from Eden Project in Cornwall, the guest was Camilla, Queen Consort. The programme is hosted by Fiona Bruce and in 2024 was in its 47th series.

==Format==

Visitors (predominantly from the area being visited by the show) bring along their possessions to be evaluated for authenticity and interest (especially related to the venue) and an approximate valuation is given. The production team selects the items whose appraisal is to be televised. Often, the professional evaluators give a rather in-depth historical, craft, or artistic context to the item, adding a very strong cultural element to the show. This increases the show&#x27;s appeal to people interested in the study of the past or some particular crafts, or certain arts, regardless of the monetary value of the objects. At the core, however, the focus of the production is on the interplay between the owner and the evaluator.

== International versions ==
===Australia===
In 2005, part of the BBC team visited Australia and produced six one-hour episodes in conjunction with The LifeStyle Channel (XYZnetworks). These were titled &quot;Antiques Roadshow Australia&quot;. A special was also made about the visit to Australia, entitled &quot;Antiques Roadshow Australia: Behind the Scenes&quot;.

===Belgium===
In Flanders, VTM has been broadcasting a local version, called &quot;Rijker dan je denkt?&quot; (&quot;Richer than you thought?&quot;) since 2012, which is hosted by Staf Coppens.

===Canada===
In Canada, &quot;Canadian Antiques Roadshow&quot; – a programme based on the British and American versionsdebuted in January 2005 on CBC Television and CBC Newsworld and ran until 2009. The show has also been aired on CBC Country Canada. It was hosted by Valerie Pringle.
The most expensive item featured was Henry Nelson O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; oil on canvas. Recommended insurance: CDN$500,000, later sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London for £164,800 (about CDN$300,000 at the 2008 exchange rate).

===Finland===
The Finnish version, known as &quot;Antiikkia, antiikkia&quot;, (&quot;Antiques, antiques&quot;), has been running on YLE TV1 since 1997.

===Germany===
In Germany, various versions are broadcast regularly on the public regional channels of the ARD, the oldest being the BR production &quot;Kunst und Krempel&quot; (&quot;Art and Junk&quot;), airing since 1985. Other versions include &quot;Lieb &amp; teuer&quot; (&quot;Near &amp; dear&quot;), shown on NDR, &quot;Kitsch oder Kunst?&quot; (&quot;Kitsch or Art?&quot;), shown on HR, and &quot;Echt Antik?!&quot; (&quot;Genuinely antique?!&quot;), shown on SWR.

===Netherlands===
The show &quot;Tussen Kunst &amp; Kitsch&quot; (&quot;Between Art &amp; Kitsch&quot;) has been running in the Netherlands since 1984. First shown on AVRO, the programme is usually set in a museum somewhere in the Netherlands, sometimes in Belgium and Germany. Due to its popularity, special episodes have been made in which the experts take the viewers on &quot;cultural art excursions&quot; to places of great importance in the history of art.

In 2011, a painting of Joost van Geel with the title &quot;Het Kantwerkstertje&quot; (&quot;The Little Lacemaker&quot;) was discovered with an estimated value of 250,000 euros, the highest-appraised item on the show. The programme has been presented by Cees van Drongelen (1984–2002), Nelleke van der Krogt (2002–2015), and Frits Sissing (2015–), and it celebrated its 40th series in 2024.

===Sweden===

The Swedish version started out as a co-production between SVT Malmö and the BBC, whose &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; visited Scandinavia for two programmes. &quot;Antikrundan&quot; (&quot;Antiques Round&quot;), its Swedish version, premiered in August 1989 on TV2, and SVT has produced a new season every year since.

As of 2019, 30 seasons have been shown and most of the experts have been with the programme since its start. Jesper Aspegren was the original host. He left in 2000, and from the 2001 season onwards, Antikrundan has been hosted by Anne Lundberg.

The BBC original is also run on Swedish television, under the name &quot;Engelska Antikrundan&quot; (&quot;English Antiques Round&quot;).

===United States===

American public broadcaster PBS created a show in 1997 inspired by the Antiques Roadshow. The American version of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; is produced by WGBH, a PBS member station in Boston, Massachusetts. Mark Walberg is host and Marsha Bemko is executive producer.

PBS also airs the original BBC programme, though it is called &quot;Antiques Roadshow UK&quot; to differentiate it from the PBS version. Values of items in United States dollars are often superimposed over the pound sterling values given in the original broadcast.

<doc id="538905" wikidata="Q24745328" url="?curid=538905" title="Bradykinin">
<text>Bradykinin (BK) (from Greek &quot;brady-&quot; &#x27;slow&#x27; + &quot;-kinin&quot;, &quot;kīn(eîn)&quot; &#x27;to move&#x27;) is a peptide that promotes inflammation. It causes arterioles to dilate (enlarge) via the release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and makes veins constrict, via prostaglandin F2, thereby leading to leakage into capillary beds, due to the increased pressure in the capillaries. Bradykinin consists of nine amino acids, and is a physiologically and pharmacologically active peptide of the kinin group of proteins.

A class of drugs called angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) increase bradykinin levels by inhibiting its degradation, thereby increasing its blood pressure lowering effect. ACE inhibitors are FDA approved for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.

== Structure ==
Bradykinin, sometimes referred to as BK, is a 9–amino acid peptide chain. The amino acid sequence of bradykinin is: Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg (RPPGFSPFR). Its empirical formula is therefore .

==Metabolism==

The kinin–kallikrein system makes bradykinin by proteolytic cleavage of its kininogen precursor, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK or HK), by the enzyme kallikrein. Moreover, there is compelling evidence that plasmin, a fibrinolytic enzyme, is able to generate bradykinin after HMWK cleavage.

In humans, bradykinin is broken down by many different kininases: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II), neprilysin, NEP2, aminopeptidase P (APP), carboxypeptidase N (CPN, kininase I), Carboxypeptidase M, Neutral endopeptidase 24.15, Endothelin converting enzyme-1, Endothelin converting enzyme-2.

== Function ==
===Effects===
Bradykinin is a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator and mild diuretic, which may cause a lowering of the blood pressure. It also causes contraction of non-vascular smooth muscle in the bronchus and gut, increases vascular permeability and is also involved in the mechanism of pain.

During inflammation, it is released locally from mast cells and basophils during tissue damage. Specifically in relation to pain, bradykinin has been shown to sensitize TRPV1 receptors, thus lowering the temperature threshold at which they activate, thus presumably contributing to allodynia.

Initial secretion of bradykinin post-natally causes constriction and eventual atrophy of the ductus arteriosus, forming the ligamentum arteriosum between the pulmonary trunk and aortic arch. It also plays a role in the constriction and eventual occlusion of a number of other fetal vessels, including the umbilical arteries and vein. The differential vasoconstriction of these fetal vessels compared to the vasodilator response of other vessels suggests that the walls of these fetal vessels are different from other vessels.

===Receptors===

* The B1 receptor (also called bradykinin receptor B1) is expressed only as a result of tissue injury, and is presumed to play a role in chronic pain. This receptor has been also described to play a role in inflammation. It was shown that the kinin B1 receptor recruits neutrophil via the chemokine CXCL5 production. Moreover, endothelial cells have been described as a potential source for this B1 receptor-CXCL5 pathway.
* The B2 receptor is constitutively expressed and participates in bradykinin&#x27;s vasodilatory role.

The kinin B1 and B2 receptors belong to G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family.

==Disorders==
Bradykinin is also thought to be the cause of the dry cough in some patients on widely prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs. It is thought that bradykinin is converted to inactive metabolites by ACE, therefore inhibition of this enzyme leads to increased levels of bradykinin; increased bradykinin sensitizes somatosensory fibers and thus causes hyperalgesia. Bradykinin may mediate this via pro-inflammatory peptides (e.g. substance P, neuropeptide Y) and a local release of histamine.

In severe cases, the elevation of bradykinin may result in angioedema, a medical emergency. People of African descent have up to five times increased risk of ACE inhibitor induced angioedema due to hereditary predisposing risk factors such as hereditary angioedema. This refractory cough is a common cause for stopping ACE inhibitor therapy.

Overactivation of bradykinin is thought to play a role in a rare disease called hereditary angioedema.

Low levels of bradykinin in the body correlate to with obesity in adolescents; it has been proposed that bradykinin can be used as a biomarker for metabolic syndrome.

Bradykinins have been implicated in a number of cancer progression processes. Increased levels of bradykinins resulting from ACE inhibitor use have been associated with increased lung cancer risks. Bradykinins have been implicated in cell proliferation and migration in gastric cancers, and bradykinin antagonists have been investigated as anti-cancer agents.

Bradykinin has been proposed as an explanation for many symptoms associated with COVID-19, including dry coughs, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, headaches, decreased cognitive function, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death.

==Therapeutic implications==
A bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) which increases both the duration and magnitude of the effects of bradykinin on vasodilation and the consequent fall in blood pressure, was discovered in &quot;Bothrops jararaca&quot; venom. On the basis of this finding, a non-protein analog of BPF which was effective orally was developed: the first angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypertension in 1981.

Currently, bradykinin inhibitors (antagonists) are being developed as potential therapies for hereditary angioedema. Icatibant is one such inhibitor. Additional bradykinin inhibitors exist. It has long been known in animal studies that bromelain, a substance obtained from the stems and leaves of the pineapple plant, suppresses trauma-induced swelling caused by the release of bradykinin into the bloodstream and tissues. Other substances that act as bradykinin inhibitors include aloe and polyphenols, substances found in red wine and green tea.

==History==
Bradykinin was discovered in 1948 by three Brazilian physiologists and pharmacologists working at the Biological Institute, in São Paulo, Brazil, led by Dr. Maurício Rocha e Silva. Together with colleagues Wilson Teixeira Beraldo and Gastão Rosenfeld, they discovered the powerful hypotensive effects of bradykinin in animal preparations. Bradykinin was detected in the blood plasma of animals after the addition of venom extracted from the &quot;Bothrops jararaca&quot; (Brazilian lancehead snake), brought by Rosenfeld from the Butantan Institute. The discovery was part of a continuing study on circulatory shock and proteolytic enzymes related to the toxicology of snake bites, started by Rocha e Silva as early as 1939. Bradykinin was to prove a new autopharmacological principle, i.e., a substance that is released in the body by a metabolic modification from precursors, which are pharmacologically active. According to B.J. Hagwood, Rocha e Silva&#x27;s biographer:The discovery of bradykinin has led to a new understanding of many physiological and pathological phenomena including circulatory shock induced by venoms and toxins.

<doc id="538913" wikidata="Q16000462" url="?curid=538913" title="Indefinite and fictitious numbers">
<text>Indefinite and fictitious numbers are words, phrases and quantities used to describe an indefinite size, used for comic effect, for exaggeration, as placeholder names, or when precision is unnecessary or undesirable. Other descriptions of this concept include: &quot;non-numerical vague quantifier&quot; and &quot;indefinite hyperbolic numerals&quot;.

== Umpteen ==

Umpteen, umteen or umpty is an unspecified but large number, used in a humorous fashion or to imply that it is not worth the effort to pin down the actual figure. Despite the &quot;-teen&quot; ending, which would seem to indicate that it lies between 12 and 20, umpteen can be much larger.

The oldest reference to &quot;umpty&quot; — in a June 17, 1848 issue of the &quot;Louisville Morning Courier&quot; — indicates that at that time it was slang for empty. This is confirmed by a humorous short story in the North Carolina &quot;Hillsborough Recorder&quot; of June 30, 1852.

By 1905, &quot;umpty&quot;, in the expression &quot;umpty-seven&quot;, had come to imply a multiple of ten. &quot;Umpty&quot; came from a verbalization of a dash in Morse code.

&quot;Umpteen&quot;, adding the ending &quot;-teen&quot;, as in &quot;thirteen&quot;, is first attested in 1884, and has become by far the most common form.

In Norwegian, &quot;ørten&quot; is used in a similar way, playing on the numbers from &quot;tretten&quot; (13) to &quot;nitten&quot; (19), but often signifying a much larger number.

Similarly, though with a larger base, Portuguese has &quot;&quot;, which is derived from the words &quot;mil(har)&quot; (1000) and the suffix &quot;-entos&quot;, present in words like &quot;trezentos&quot; (300) or &quot;quinhentos&quot; (500), roughly meaning &quot;hundred&quot;.

== Zillion==
Words with the suffix &quot;-illion&quot; (e.g., zillion, gazillion, bazillion, jillion, bajillion, squillion, and others) are often used as informal names for unspecified large numbers by analogy to names of large numbers such as &quot;million&quot; (106), &quot;billion&quot; (109) and &quot;trillion&quot; (1012). In Estonian, the compound word &quot;mustmiljon&quot; (&quot;black million&quot;) is used to mean an unfathomably large number. In Hungarian, &quot;csilliárd&quot; is used in the same &quot;indefinitely large number&quot; sense as &quot;zillion&quot; in English, and is thought to be a humorous portmanteau of the words &quot;csillag&quot; (&quot;star&quot;, referring to the vast number of stars) and &quot;milliárd&quot; (&quot;billion&quot;, cf. long scale).

These words are intended to denote a number that is large enough to be unfathomable and are typically used as hyperbole or for comic effect. They have no precise value or order. They form ordinals and fractions with the usual suffix &quot;-th&quot;, e.g. &quot;I asked her for the jillionth time&quot;, or are used with the suffix &quot;-aire&quot; to describe a wealthy person.

==Sagan==
A sagan or sagan unit is a facetious name for a very large number inspired by Carl Sagan&#x27;s association with the phrase &quot;billions and billions&quot;. It is not to be confused with Sagan&#x27;s number, the number of stars in the observable universe.
== Specific values used as indefinite ==

In context, a specific numeric value may be used to mean an unspecific quantity. Following are examples.

Some words that have a precise numerical definition can be used indefinitely. For example: couple (2), dozen (12), score (20); myriad (10,000). 

When a quantity word is prefixed with an indefinite article then it is sometimes intended or interpreted to be indefinite. For example, &quot;one million&quot; is clearly definite, but &quot;a million&quot; could be used to mean either a definite (she has a million followers now) or an indefinite value (she signed what felt like a million papers).

The title &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; &quot;a thousand nights and one night&quot;) impiles a large number of nights. Many book titles use this convention as well; such as &quot;1,001 Uses for ...&quot;.

In Chinese, , 108,000 li, means a great distance.

In Danish, &quot;hundrede og sytten&quot; (&quot;a hundred and seventeen&quot;) can mean any arbitrary number.

In French, 36 and 36,000 are occasionally used as a synonym for &quot;very many&quot;.

In Hebrew and other Middle Eastern traditions, the number 40 is used to express a large but unspecific number, as in the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot;, &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;, and the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. This usage is sometimes found in English as well (for example, &quot;&quot;).

In Irish, 100,000 (&quot;céad míle&quot;) is used, as in the phrase , &quot;a hundred thousand welcomes&quot; or Gabriel Rosenstock&#x27;s poetic phrase (&quot;my hundred thousand loves&quot;).

In Japanese, , 8000, is used: (&quot;lit.&quot; 8,000 herbs) means a variety of herbs and (&quot;lit.&quot; 8,000 generations) means eternity.

In Latin, (600) was used to mean a very large number, perhaps from the size of a Roman cohort. The modern word &quot;million&quot; derives from an Italian augmentative of the Latin word for thousand, .

In Polish, &quot;tysiąc pięćset sto dziewięćset&quot; (&quot;one thousand five hundred one hundred nine hundred&quot;) is used, to refer to an indefinitely large number.

In Scottish Gaelic, 100,000 (&quot;ceud mìle&quot;) is used to mean a great number, as in the phrase &quot;ceud mìle fàilte&quot;, &quot;a hundred thousand welcomes.&quot;

In Swedish, or is used ( &quot;fifty-eleven&quot; and &quot;seventy-eleven&quot;, although never actually intended to refer to the numbers 61 and 81).

In Thai, ร้อยแปด (&quot;roi paed)&quot; means both 108 and miscellaneous, various, plentiful.

In Welsh, &quot;cant a mil&quot;, literally &quot;a hundred and thousand&quot;, is used to mean a large number in a similar way to English &quot;a hundred and one&quot;. It is used in phrases such as &quot;cant a mil o bethau i&#x27;w wneud&quot; &quot;a hundred and one things to do&quot; i.e. &quot;many, many things to do&quot;.

The number 10,000 is used to express an even larger approximate number, as in Hebrew &quot;revâvâh&quot;, rendered into Greek as , and to English &quot;myriad&quot;. Similar usage is found in the East Asian or (&quot;lit.&quot; 10,000; ), and the South Asian lakh (&quot;lit.&quot; 100,000).

<text>In music notation, dal segno (, , ), often abbreviated as D.S., is used as a navigation marker. Defined as &quot;from the sign&quot; in Italian, D.S. appears in sheet music and instructs a musician to repeat a passage starting from the sign shown at right, sometimes called the &quot;segno&quot; in English.

Two common variants:
*D.S. al coda instructs the musician to go back to the sign, and when &quot;Al coda&quot; or &quot;To coda&quot; is reached jump to the coda symbol.
*D.S. al fine instructs the musician to go back to the sign, and end the piece at the measure marked &quot;fine&quot;.
Al segno indicates that the player should go to the sign. Da capo al segno (D.C. al Segno), &quot;From the beginning to the sign (𝄋).&quot;

In operas of the 18th century, dal segno arias were a common alternative to da capo arias which began with an opening ritornello, which was then omitted in the repeat (the sign being placed after the ritornello).

==Encoding==
The &quot;segno&quot; sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as .
