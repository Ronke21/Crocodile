<text>Holsworthy is a suburb in south-western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located roughly 31 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool. It is the largest suburb in Sydney by area.

Holsworthy is best known for the Holsworthy Barracks, a large Australian Army reserve where training exercises frequently occur. The reserve lies adjacent to Heathcote Road, which connects to Bankstown, Liverpool, Lucas Heights, Engadine, and Heathcote. Signs around the perimeter warn potential trespassers about the use of laser-guided and conventional gunfire.

The residential area lies north of the railway station. Anzac Village, situated in the northern part of the suburb and extending into the adjacent suburb of Wattle Grove, features a recent development called &#x27;Mornington.&#x27; Additionally, a new shopping centre has been constructed in the area.

==History==
The area was named after Holsworthy, Devon, England, where Governor Lachlan Macquarie married Elizabeth Campbell on November 3, 1807. It was originally spelt Holdsworthy until after World War II, when the &#x27;d&#x27; was dropped.

This land was occupied by the Tharawal people. With the arrival of the First Fleet, indigenous people were pushed back from their traditional lands in the area surrounding Sydney. In 1795, explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders explored the Georges River, and in 1798, grants of land for farming were made in the area. The soil was good and crops of corn, wheat, and vegetables were soon being harvested.

However, tensions developed with the Tharawal. In 1801, Governor King ordered soldiers to fire on the aborigines to keep them from settler&#x27;s properties. By 1815, Governor Macquarie declared a state of open warfare against aborigines in the Georges River area and forbade them carrying weapons within a mile of any British settlement. Ultimately, the British prevailed.

A settlement named Eckersley was established in 1835 on what is now military land. By the 1880s, a number of vineyards were established in the area. The land was acquired by the army in 1913. During World War I, it was home to a large internment camp for civilians of German or Austro-Hungarian background. The camp absorbed prisoners from the infamous Torrens Island Concentration Camp in 1915. The modern village of Holsworthy evolved after World War II to the north, with the barracks to the south. The streets are named with a military theme, such as Tarakan, Bardia, Wewak, Lae, Brunei, Finschhafen, Madang, Gona, Anzac, Light Horse, Infantry, Cavalry, Sabre, Gunners Row, and Trooper Row. In Anzac Village, Australian Generals are remembered with Birdwood, Monash, Bridges and Blamey.

On 3 September 1997, a controversial proposal for plans of an airport at Holsworthy was eliminated by the Federal Government.

The Holsworthy bushland retains many indigenous sites and has been referred to as &quot;Sydney&#x27;s Kakadu&quot;. There are more than 500 significant Tharawal sites in the area, including campsites, tool-making sites, and rock art. The art is mostly engravings of hands, boomerangs, animals, birds, and fish.

==Climate==
Holsworthy has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), like most of Sydney, with warm summers and cool to mild winters, and precipitation spread throughout the year. Thunderstorms are common in the summer months and provide most of the precipitation in that season. Winters are pleasantly cool and sunny, although east coast lows can bring large amounts of rainfall. Snow has never occurred, although frost is a fairly common occurrence in winter. Being inland from the coast and away from Sydney City, Holsworthy receives up to 500mm (20Â in) less precipitation than coastal areas, just away.

==Population==
According to the , Holsworthy had a population of . There were a high number of families with children (63.4%), and the median age of Holsworthy residents (31) was seven years younger than the national median. Defence was a major industry of employment, covering 16.7% of the suburb&#x27;s residents. The median family income ($ per week) was substantially higher than the national median ($).

59.9% of people were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth included India 8.2%, the Philippines 2.8%, Bangladesh 2.4%, China (excluding Special Administrative Regions (SARs) and Taiwan) 2.3%, and New Zealand 1.8%. 56.7% of people only spoke English at home; other languages spoken at home included Hindi 3.3%, Bengali 3.2%, Mandarin 2.8%, Arabic 2.4%, and Malayalam 2.3%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.4%, Catholic 21.5%, Hinduism 12.2%, and Anglican 8.4%; a further 7.1% of respondents for this area elected not to disclose their religious status.

<doc id="556734" wikidata="Q5142348" url="?curid=556734" title="Cold Spring station (Metro-North)">
<text>Cold Spring station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Cold Spring, New York.

==History==

The Hudson River Railroad was built through Cold Spring in 1851 in order to expand the Troy and Greenbush Railroad from the Albany area to New York City. HRR was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1864, which also built a depot here in 1893. A pedestrian tunnel was added in 1929 connecting the two sections of Main Street, and a road bridge over the tracks was built in 1930, but the station was closed to passengers in 1954, despite remaining in use.

As with all stations along the Hudson Line, it was converted into a Penn Central Railroad station upon the merger of NYC with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968. Bankruptcy for Penn Central in 1970 forced them to turn passenger service over to the MTA in 1972, the same year that the former station house was converted into a restaurant after spending 18 years as a car dealership.

MTA control of passenger service continued through the period when it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, and then by Metro-North Railroad in 1983. Cold Spring station was one of the last stations within the system to be rebuilt and relocated with high-level platforms, a pedestrian bridge, and elevators. The former station house is within the boundaries of the Cold Spring Historic District. The current Cold Spring station is located slightly south of the old one, still standing at the foot of Cold Spring&#x27;s Main Street. Walkways on both sides of the tracks connect the old and new station, and the pedestrian tunnel built by New York Central Railroad is still in use by both commuters and local residents. 

==Station layout==
The station has two high-level side platforms each six cars long.

<doc id="556735" wikidata="Q2569715" url="?curid=556735" title="Kneeboarding (towsport)">
<text>Kneeboarding is an aquatic sport where the participant is towed on a buoyant, convex, and hydrodynamically shaped board at a planing speed, most often behind a motorboat. Kneeboarding on a surf style board with fin(s) is also done in waves at the beach. In the usual configuration of a tow-sport kneeboard, riders kneel on their heels on the board, and secure themselves to the deck with an adjustable Velcro strap over their thighs. Most water ski kneeboards do not have fins to allow for easier surface spins. As in wakeboarding or water skiing, the rider hangs onto a tow-rope. The advantages of kneeboarding versus other tow-sports seems to be an easier learning curve and a sense of being closer to the water when falls occur.

<doc id="556737" wikidata="Q1458053" url="?curid=556737" title="The Mix (Kraftwerk album)">
<text>The Mix is the tenth studio album by the German electronic music band Kraftwerk. It was released on 10 June 1991 by Kling Klang and EMI in Europe and by Elektra Records in North America. It features entirely re-arranged and re-recorded versions of a selection of songs which had originally appeared on Kraftwerk&#x27;s albums &quot;Autobahn&quot; (1974) through &quot;Electric CafÃ©&quot; (1986). Some of the songs, such as &quot;The Robots&quot; and &quot;Radioactivity&quot;, feature new additional melodies and/or lyrics.

==Background==
In 1990, Kraftwerk had made a return to the stage, following a nine-year hiatus from touring. Ralf HÃ¼tter stated in interviews that he regarded &quot;The Mix&quot; as a type of &quot;live&quot; album, as it captured the results of the band&#x27;s continual digital improvisations in their Kling Klang studio. The versions of songs on &quot;The Mix&quot; subsequently became staples of the band&#x27;s live set. 

Karl Bartos stated in a 1998 interview with &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; that the original idea for &quot;The Mix&quot; was to release a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, a suggestion from Bob Krasnow at the band&#x27;s U.S. record label, Elektra Records. Bartos elaborated that the idea &quot;didn&#x27;t really appeal to [Ralf], so he came up with the idea of making a remix record. He was really thinking ahead, but I think if you made the original record, you shouldn&#x27;t do the remix yourself. Somebody else should have done it.&quot; In a 1991 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, HÃ¼tter said that &quot;Kraftwerk is always a work-in-progress. We have no five-year plan. It&#x27;s all about what&#x27;s happening in the music, the &quot;zeitfenster&quot; at the time. So our &quot;Mix&quot; album is about these times, the remixing, cutting up and regeneration of old tracks.&quot; During this period, the band was converting their Kling Klang studio to digital, transferring its sound library from 24-track analogue tape to disc, which factored into the album&#x27;s creation. This conversion project proved to be an ongoing task, as new upgrades and equipment were continually made available in the years following the album project. 

Bartos stated that he was responsible for &quot;all of the programming&quot; on the record but went uncredited. The prolonged production period for the album led band members Wolfgang FlÃ¼r and, later, Bartos to leave the group before its release. They were replaced by Fritz Hilpert and Fernando Abrantes.

==Reception==

&quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Robert Christgau praised the album at the time, calling it a &quot;best-of with the bass boosted&quot;.

In retrospective reviews, AllMusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson observed that &quot;Dance clubs had long been a key part of Kraftwerk&#x27;s following, and the dance club was the obvious target of &quot;The Mix&quot; â a collection of highly enjoyable, often clever remixes&quot;, adding that it was a &quot;welcome addition to the Kraftwerk catalog&quot;. Tom Ewing of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; cited the new versions of &quot;Autobahn&quot; and &quot;Radioactivity&quot; as highlights, adding that, &quot;unlike most mix albums of the period this one had a purpose: these more physical and propulsive versions have fed into Kraftwerk&#x27;s live set ever since&quot;. David Kavanagh of &quot;Uncut&quot; called it &quot;a surprisingly addictive re-imagining of 11 classic tracks in a dancefloor context&quot;. While Andrew Harrison of &quot;Select&quot; awarded the album five stars out of five, his opinion was that &quot;HÃ¼tter and Schneider threw themselves into techno as if they&#x27;d invented it (which they had), but updating Kraftwerk was always rather pointless, as their music has never dated at all&quot;. Chris Power of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; called it the band&#x27;s &quot;most idiosyncratic release&quot;, observing, &quot;At its lowest ebb, crushingly, &quot;The Mix&quot; deals in an excruciating neutering of its source material ... its other sins being ones of redundancy rather than active damage.&quot; However, he singled out elements of &quot;Autobahn&quot; as what the album &quot;could have been if Kraftwerk had elected to really work these tracks over in a radical way, rather than essentially updating them to dance music&#x27;s early-Nineties industry standard&quot;.

&quot;The Mix&quot; was placed first in &quot;The Wire&quot;â³s year-end poll for 1991, the first time that the magazine â previously known for its focus on jazz â had an all-genre category.

==Re-release==
A newly remastered edition of the album was released by EMI Records, Mute Records and Astralwerks Records on CD, digital download and heavyweight vinyl in OctoberâNovember 2009. Because of licensing restrictions imposed by Warner Music Group, this version has only been made available in the US and Canada as a part of &quot;The Catalogue&quot; box set.

==Track listing==

* &quot;Home Computer&quot; also includes elements from &quot;It&#x27;s More Fun to Compute&quot;
* &quot;Music Non Stop&quot; also includes elements from &quot;Boing Boom Tschak&quot; and &quot;Techno Pop&quot;

<doc id="556739" wikidata="Q348577" url="?curid=556739" title="Tony Abbott">
<text>Anthony John Abbott (; born 4 November 1957) is a British-born Australian former politician who served as the 28th prime minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015. He held office as the leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and was the member of parliament (MP) for the New South Wales division of Warringah from 1994 to 2019.

Abbott was born in London, England, to an Australian mother and a British father, and moved to Sydney at the age of two. He studied economics and law at the University of Sydney, and then attended The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After graduating from Oxford, Abbott briefly trained as a Roman Catholic seminarian, and later worked as a journalist, manager, and political adviser. In 1992, he was appointed director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, a position he held until his election to parliament as a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Warringah at the 1994 Warringah by-election, before the election of the Howard government in 1996.

Following the 1998 election, Abbott was appointed Minister for Employment Services in the second Howard ministry. He was promoted to cabinet in 2001 as Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. In 2003, Abbott became Minister for Health and Ageing, retaining this position until the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 election. Initially serving in the shadow cabinets of Brendan Nelson and then Malcolm Turnbull, Abbott resigned from the front bench in November 2009, in protest against Turnbull&#x27;s support for the Rudd government&#x27;s proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Forcing a leadership ballot on the subject, Abbott narrowly defeated Turnbull to become the party&#x27;s leader and leader of the opposition. Abbott led the Liberal-National Coalition to the 2010 federal election, which resulted in a hung parliament, and an eventual victory for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Abbott remained leader, and led the Coalition to a landslide victory at the 2013 election.

After assuming office, the Abbott government implemented Operation Sovereign Borders in an effort to halt unauthorised maritime arrivals. It abolished several reforms enacted by the preceding government, including the Minerals Resource Rent Tax and Australia&#x27;s carbon pricing scheme. His government aimed to rein in a federal budget deficit that reached A$48.5Â billion by June 2014, and established the National Commission of Audit to advise on restoring the federal budget to surplus. Abbott instituted the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption; founded the Medical Research Future Fund; and produced white papers on developing Northern Australia and the Agricultural Competitiveness. In international affairs, Abbott concluded free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea. He challenged the Russian president Vladimir Putin over Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine and over the shooting down of Malaysian Flight MH17 in Ukraine. He committed Australian forces to the battle against ISIS during the Syrian conflict, and agreed to resettle an additional 12,000 refugees from the region. He launched the New Colombo Plan to encourage educational exchange with the Indo-Pacific region. Domestically, Abbott campaigned for recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution, and promised a plebiscite on the issue of same-sex marriage.

Abbott&#x27;s &quot;budget repair&quot; measures proved unpopular, with his government&#x27;s austere 2014 budget being widely criticised. Due to Abbott&#x27;s poor opinion polling and personal unpopularity, he was defeated by rival Malcolm Turnbull in a September 2015 leadership spill, and replaced as prime minister. He remained in the Parliament as a backbencher, until he lost his seat of Warringah to independent candidate Zali Steggall at the 2019 federal election. In September 2020, he was named an adviser to the British government&#x27;s Board of Trade. Abbott continues to contribute to international public debate as a writer, public speaker and advocate for conservative causes.

== Early life ==
===Birth and family background===
Abbott was born on 4 November 1957 at the General Lying-In Hospital in Lambeth, London, England. He is the oldest of four children born to Fay (nÃ©e Peters; b. 1933) and Richard Henry &quot;Dick&quot; Abbott (1924â2017). He has three younger sisters, including Christine Forster, who has also been involved in politics. His mother was born in Sydney, while his father was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.

At age 16, Dick Abbott moved to Australia with his parents. Two years later, in 1942, he was called up to the Royal Australian Air Force. Dick Abbott and his mother returned to the UK in 1954 where he met and married Fay Peters, a dietitian.

=== Childhood and education ===
On 7 September 1960, Abbott, his parents, and younger sister Jane, left the UK for Australia on the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme ship SS &quot;Oronsay&quot;. Settling in Sydney, the family first lived in the suburb of Bronte and later moved to Chatswood. Dick Abbott established what was to become one of the largest orthodontics practices in Australia, retiring in 2002.

Abbott attended primary school at St Aloysius&#x27; College at Milson&#x27;s Point, before completing his secondary school education at St Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview, both Jesuit schools. During his time at St Ignatius&#x27; College, one was his teachers was John Kennedy, who would later go on to serve as the member for Hawthorn. He graduated with a Bachelor of Economics (BEc) in 1979 and a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) in 1981 from the University of Sydney. He resided at St John&#x27;s College and was president of the Student Representative Council. Influenced by his chaplain at St Ignatius&#x27;, Father Emmet Costello, he then attended The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, where in June 1983 he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) and on 21 October 1989 proceeded by seniority to Master of Arts.

During his university days, Abbott gained media attention for political opposition to the then dominant left-wing student leadership. Once he was violently beaten at a university conference. According to the &quot;Sun-Herald&quot; newspaper, it was &quot;an ugly and often violent time&quot;, and Abbott&#x27;s tactics in student politics were like &quot;an aggressive terrier&quot;. Abbott organised rallies in support of Governor-General John Kerr after he dismissed the Whitlam government in November 1975, as well as a pro-Falklands War demonstration during his time at Oxford. At St. Ignatius College, Abbott had been taught and influenced by the Jesuits. At university, he encountered B. A. Santamaria, a Catholic layman who led a movement against Communism within the Australian labour movement in the 1950s, culminating in the 1955 Labor Party split and the formation of the Democratic Labor Party. Santamaria has been described as Abbott&#x27;s &quot;political hero&quot;. He wrote the foreword to a novelisation of Santamaria&#x27;s life written by Alan Reid, and in 2015 launched a biography of Santamaria written by Gerard Henderson. In 1977, Abbott faced charges of common and indecent assault after allegedly groping trainee teacher Helen Wilson while she was making a speech at the College of Advanced Education in Kuring-gai, Sydney. Abbott pleaded not guilty, and the charges were ultimately dropped.

Abbott was a student boxer, earning two Blues for boxing while at Oxford.

When Abbott was a student, on one occasion he rescued a child who had been pulled out into the sea by the current. On another occasion, while drinking at a pub, he helped rescue children from the burning house next door. On both of these occasions, he left the scene after the rescues and did not wait to be thanked.

=== Early adult life and pre-political career ===
Following his time in Britain, Abbott returned to Australia and told his family of his intention to join the priesthood. In 1984 at the age of 26, he entered St Patrick&#x27;s Seminary, Manly. Abbott did not complete his studies at the seminary, leaving the institution in 1987. Interviewed before the 2013 election, Abbott said of his time as a trainee priest: &quot;The Jesuits had helped to instil in me this thought that our calling in life was to be, to use the phrase: &#x27;a man for others&#x27;. And I thought then that the best way in which I could be a &#x27;man for others&#x27; was to become a priest. I discovered pretty soon that I was a bit of a square peg in a round hole â¦ eventually working out that, I&#x27;m afraid, I just didn&#x27;t have what it took to be an effective priest.&quot;

Abbott worked in journalism, briefly ran a concrete plant, and began to get involved in national politics. Throughout his time as a student and seminarian, he was writing articles for newspapers and magazinesâfirst for &quot;Honi Soit&quot; (the University of Sydney student newspaper) and later &quot;The Catholic Weekly&quot; and national publications such as &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. He eventually became a journalist and wrote for &quot;The Australian&quot;.

At birth, Abbott was a British citizen by birth in the UK and by descent from his British-born father. He did not hold Australian citizenship from birth, as at the time Australian citizenship by descent could only be acquired from the father. Abbott became a naturalised Australian citizen on 26 June 1981, apparently so as to become eligible for a Rhodes scholarship. On 12 October 1993, he renounced his British citizenship to be eligible to run for parliament under section 44 of the constitution.

== Political career ==

=== Early career ===
Abbott began his public life when he was employed as a journalist for &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, an influential news magazine, and later for &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper. While deciding his future career path, Abbott developed friendships with senior figures in the New South Wales Labor Party, and was encouraged by Bob Carr, as well as Johno Johnson, to join the Labor Party and run for office. Abbott felt uncomfortable with the role of unions within the party, however, and wrote in his biography that he felt Labor &quot;just wasn&#x27;t the party for me.&quot;

From 1990 to 1993, he was press secretary to Liberal Leader John Hewson, helping to develop the Fightback! policy. Prime Minister John Howard wrote in his autobiography that Abbott considered working on his staff before accepting the position with &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, and it was on Howard&#x27;s recommendation that Hewson engaged Abbott. According to Howard, he and Abbott established a good rapport, but Hewson and Abbott fell out shortly before the 1993 election, and Abbott ended up in search of work following the re-election of the Keating government. He was approached to head Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (ACM), the main group organising support for the maintenance of the Monarchy in Australia amidst the Keating government&#x27;s campaign for a change to a republic. Abbott renounced his British citizenship in 1993. Between 1993 and 1994, Abbott was Executive Director of ACM. According to biographer Michael Duffy, Abbott&#x27;s involvement with ACM &quot;strengthened his relationship with John Howard, who in 1994 suggested he seek pre-selection for a by-election in the seat of Warringah&quot;. Howard provided a glowing reference and Abbott won pre-selection for the safe Liberal seat.

Despite his conservative leanings, Abbott acknowledged he voted for Labor in the 1988 NSW state election as he thought that &quot;Barrie Unsworth was the best deal Premier that New South Wales had ever had&quot;. Nevertheless, Abbott then clarified that he has never voted for Labor in a federal election.

=== Member of Parliament, 1994â2009 ===

Abbott won Liberal preselection for the federal Division of Warringah by-election in March 1994 following the resignation of Michael MacKellar. He easily held the safe Liberal seat in the Liberals&#x27; traditional Northern Beaches heartland, suffering a swing of only 1 percentage point in the primary vote. He easily won the seat in his own right at the 1996 general election. Before 2019, he only dropped below 59 percent of the two-party vote once, in 2001; that year independent Peter Macdonald, the former member for the state seat of Manly, held Abbott to only 55 percent.

Abbott was the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (1996â1998), Minister for Employment Services (1998â2001), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Small Business (2001), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (2001â03) and Minister for Health and Ageing from 2003 to November 2007. From early 2002 to October 2007, he was also the Leader of the House in the House of Representatives.

In 1998, Abbott established a trust fund called &quot;Australians for Honest Politics Trust&quot; to help bankroll civil court cases against the One Nation Party and its leader Pauline Hanson. Prime Minister John Howard denied any knowledge of existence of such a fund. Abbott was also accused of offering funds to One Nation dissident Terry Sharples to support his court battle against the party. However, Howard defended the honesty of Abbott in this matter. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the Howard government was &quot;a very big factor&quot; in his decision to pursue the legal attack, but he also claimed to be acting &quot;in Australia&#x27;s national interest&quot;. Howard also defended Abbott&#x27;s actions saying &quot;It&#x27;s the job of the Liberal Party to politically attack other parties â there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.&quot;

As a Parliamentary Secretary, Abbott oversaw the establishment of the &quot;Green Corps&quot; program which involved young people in environmental restoration work. As Minister for Employment Services, he oversaw the implementation of the Job Network and was responsible for the government&#x27;s Work for the Dole scheme. He also commissioned the Cole Royal Commission into &quot;thuggery and rorts&quot; in the construction industry and created the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner in response and to lift productivity.

The Liberal Party allowed members a free choice in the 1999 republic referendum. Abbott was one of the leading voices within the party campaigning for the successful &quot;No&quot; vote, pitting him against future parliamentary colleague and leading republican Malcolm Turnbull.

==== Cabinet minister (1998â2007) ====
When Abbott was promoted to the Cabinet in 1998, Prime Minister Howard described him as an effective performer with an endearing style, whereas the Opposition described him as a &quot;bomb thrower.&quot; Howard appointed Abbott to replace Kay Patterson as Minister for Health in 2003, during a period of contentious Medicare reform and a crisis in Medical indemnity Insurance, in which the price of insurance was forcing doctors out of practice. The Australian Medical Association was threatening to pull out all Australian doctors. Abbott worked with the states to address the crisis and keep the system running.

Health care initiatives instigated by Abbott include the Nurse Family Partnership, a long term scheme aimed at improving conditions for indigenous youth by improving mother-child relationships. The scheme was successful in reducing child abuse and improving school retention rates.

In 2005, Abbott was holidaying with his family in Bali when the Bali bombings occurred. Abbott visited the victims of the bombings in hospital, and in his capacity as Health Minister organised for Australians who required lifesaving emergency surgery and hospitalisation to be flown to Singapore.

In 2006, Abbott controversially opposed access to the abortion drug RU486, and the Parliament voted to strip Health Ministers of the power to regulate this area of policy. During this time, Abbott likened the act of having an abortion to committing a murder, saying &quot;we have a bizarre double standard, a bizarre double standard in this country where someone who kills a pregnant woman&#x27;s baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply exercising choice&quot;.

Abbott introduced the Medicare Safety Net to cap the annual out-of-pocket costs of Medicare cardholders to a maximum amount. In 2007, he attracted criticism over long delays in funding for cancer diagnostic equipment (PET scanners).

According to &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s&quot; political editor, Peter Hartcher, before the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 election, Abbott had opposed the government&#x27;s centrepiece WorkChoices industrial relations deregulation reform in Cabinet, on the basis that the legislation exceeded the government&#x27;s mandate, was harsh on workers, and was politically dangerous to the government. John Howard wrote in his 2010 autobiography that Abbott was &quot;never a zealot about pursuing industrial relations changes&quot; and expressed &quot;concern about making too many changes&quot; during Cabinet&#x27;s discussion of WorkChoices.

Abbott campaigned as Minister for Health at the 2007 election. On 31 October, he apologised for saying &quot;just because a person is sick doesn&#x27;t mean that he is necessarily pure of heart in all things&quot;, after Bernie Banton, an asbestos campaigner and terminal mesothelioma sufferer, complained that Abbott was unavailable to collect a petition. In &quot;The Australian Doctor&quot;&#x27;s 2015 poll, Tony Abbott was ranked as the third &quot;worst health minister in 35 years&quot;, as voted on by doctors. Peter Dutton was ranked the overall worst.

==== Shadow minister (2007â2009) ====
The Coalition lost government in 2007 and Abbott was re-elected to the seat of Warringah with a 1.8% swing toward the Labor Party. Following Peter Costello&#x27;s rejection of the leadership of the Parliamentary Liberal Party, Abbott nominated for the position of party leader, along with Malcolm Turnbull and Brendan Nelson. After canvassing the support of his colleagues, Abbott decided to withdraw his nomination. He seemingly did not have the numbers, noting that he was &quot;obviously very closely identified with the outgoing prime minister.&quot; He said he would not rule out contesting the leadership at some time in the future. Of the three candidates, Abbott was the only one who had previous experience in Opposition. Nelson was elected Liberal leader in December 2007 and Abbott was assigned the Shadow Portfolio of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. As indigenous affairs spokesman, Abbott said that it had been a mistake for the Howard government not to offer a national apology to the Stolen Generations; spent time teaching at remote Aboriginal communities; and argued for the Rudd government to continue the Northern Territory National Emergency Response which restricted alcohol and introduced conditional welfare in certain Aboriginal communities.

During this period in Opposition, Abbott wrote &quot;Battlelines&quot;, a biography and reflection on the Howard government, and potential future policy direction for the Liberal Party. In the book, Abbott said that in certain aspects the Australian Federation was &quot;dysfunctional&quot; and in need of repair. He recommended the establishment of local hospital and school boards to manage health and education, and discussed family law reform, multiculturalism, climate change, and international relations. The book received a favourable review from former Labor Party speech writer Bob Ellis and &quot;The Australian&quot; described it as &quot;read almost universally as Abbott&#x27;s intellectual application for the party&#x27;s leadership after the Turnbull experiment&quot;.

The number of unauthorised immigrant arrivals in boats to Australia increased during 2008. Abbott claimed that this was an effect of the Rudd government&#x27;s easing of border protection laws and accused Kevin Rudd of ineptitude and hypocrisy on the issue of unauthorised immigrants upon boats arriving, particularly during the Oceanic Viking affair of October 2009, saying, &quot;John Howard found a problem and created a solution. Kevin Rudd found a solution and has now created a problem&quot;.

During November 2009, Abbott resigned from shadow ministerial responsibilities due to the Liberal Party&#x27;s position on the Rudd government&#x27;s Emissions trading Scheme (ETS), leading to the resignation of other shadow ministers.

== Leader of the Opposition (2009â2013) ==
On 1 December 2009, Abbott was elected to the position of Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia over Turnbull and Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Abbott proposed blocking the government&#x27;s ETS in the Senate whereas Turnbull sought to amend the bill which the majority of the Liberal Party did not support. Abbott named his Shadow Cabinet on 8 December 2009.

Abbott described Prime Minister Rudd&#x27;s Emission Trading plan as a &#x27;Great big tax on everything&#x27; and opposed it. The Coalition and minor parties voted against the government&#x27;s ETS legislation in the Senate and the legislation was rejected. Abbott announced a new Coalition policy on carbon emission reduction in February, which committed the Coalition to a 5 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. Abbott proposed the creation of an &#x27;emissions reduction fund&#x27; to provide &#x27;direct&#x27; incentives to industry and farmers to reduce carbon emissions. In April, Rudd announced that plans for the introduction his ETS would be delayed until 2013.

When appointed to the Liberal leadership, Abbott&#x27;s Catholicism and moral beliefs became subjects of repeated media questioning. Various commentators suggested that his traditionalist views would polarise female voters. He told press gallery journalist Laurie Oakes that he did not do doorstop interviews in front of church but regularly faced pointed questions about his faith which were not being put to Prime Minister Rudd, who conducted weekly church door press conferences following his attendances at Anglican services.

Abbott reportedly missed the 2009 vote on the Rudd government $42Â billion stimulus package because he fell asleep in his parliamentary office after a night of drinking. When asked by a journalist whether he had been drunk, Abbott said &quot;that is an impertinent question&quot; and that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t keeping count&quot; but thought it was &quot;maybe two&quot; bottles of wine.

In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview aired on 7 March 2010, Abbott was asked: &quot;Homosexuality? How do you feel about that?&quot;. He replied: &quot;I&#x27;d probably feel a bit threatened â¦ it&#x27;s a fact of life and I try to treat people as people and not put them in pigeonholes.&quot; In later interviews Abbott apologised for the remark. In 2013, Abbott stated on 3AW that if his sister Christine Forster were to have a marriage ceremony with her partner Virginia he would attend.
In March 2010, Abbott, announced a new policy initiative to provide for six months paid parental leave, funded by an increase in corporate tax by 1.7 percentage points on all taxable company income above $5Â million. Business groups and the government opposed the plan, however it won support from the Australian Greens.

While Opposition Spokesman for Indigenous Affairs, Abbott spent time in remote Cape York Aboriginal communities as a teacher, organised through prominent indigenous activist Noel Pearson. Abbott repeatedly spoke of his admiration for Pearson, and in March 2010, introduced the &quot;Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill&quot; to Parliament in support of Pearson&#x27;s campaign to overturn the Queensland government&#x27;s &quot;Wild Rivers&quot; legislation. Abbott and Pearson believed that the Queensland law would &#x27;block the economic development&#x27; of indigenous land, and interfere with Aboriginal land rights.

Abbott completed an Ironman Triathlon event in March 2010 at Port Macquarie, New South Wales. In April he set out on a 9-day charity bike ride between Melbourne and Sydney, the annual Pollie Pedal, generating political debate about whether he should have committed so much time to physical fitness. Abbott described the events as an opportunity to &quot;stop at lots of little towns along the way where people probably never see or don&#x27;t very often see a federal member of Parliament.&quot;

In his first Budget reply speech as Opposition Leader, Abbott sought to portray the Rudd government&#x27;s third budget as a &quot;tax and spend&quot; budget and promised to fight the election on the new mining &quot;super-profits&quot; tax proposed by Rudd.

=== 2010 election ===

On 24 June 2010, Julia Gillard replaced Kevin Rudd as Australian Labor Party leader and prime minister. The replacement of a first-term prime minister was unusual in Australian political history and the Rudd-Gillard rivalry remained a vexed issue for the Gillard government into the 2010 election and its subsequent term. On 17 July, Gillard called the 2010 federal election for 21 August. Polls in the first week gave a view that Labor would be re-elected with an increased majority, with Newspoll and an Essential poll showing a lead of 10 points (55â45) two party preferred.

The two leaders met for one official debate during the campaign. Studio audience surveys by Channel 9 and Seven Network suggested a win to Gillard. Unable to agree on further debates, the leaders went on to appear separately on stage for questioning at community fora in Sydney and Brisbane. In Sydney on 11 August, Abbott&#x27;s opening statement focused on his main election messages around government debt, taxation and asylum seekers. An exit poll of the Rooty Hill RSL audience accorded Abbott victory. Gillard won the audience poll at Broncos Leagues Club meeting in Brisbane on 18 August. Abbott appeared for public questioning on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; program on 16 August.

Labor and the Coalition each won 72 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, four short of the requirement for majority government, resulting in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election.

Abbott and Gillard commenced a 17-day period of negotiation with crossbenchers over who would form government. On the crossbench, four independent members, one member of the National Party of Western Australia and one member of the Australian Greens held the balance of power. Following the negotiations, Gillard formed a minority government with the support of an Australian Greens MP and three independent MPs on the basis of confidence and supply. Another independent and the WA National gave their confidence and supply support to the Coalition, resulting in Labor holding a 76â74 tally of votes on the floor of the Parliament. The Coalition finished with 49.88 percent of the two party preferred vote, obtaining a national swing of around 2.6%.

During negotiations, the Independents requested that both major parties&#x27; policies be costed by the apolitical Australian Treasury. The Coalition initially resisted the idea, citing concerns over Treasury leaks, however they eventually allowed the analysis. Treasury endorsed Labor&#x27;s budget costings but projected that Coalition policies would add between $860Â million and $4.5Â billion to the bottom line over the next four years, rather than the $11.5Â billion
projected by the Coalition. The close result was lauded by former prime minister John Howard, who wrote in 2010 that Abbott had shifted the dynamic of Australian politics after coming to the leadership in 2009 and &quot;deserves hero status among Liberals&quot;.

=== After the 2010 election ===
Following the 2010 election, Abbott and his deputy, Julie Bishop, were re-elected unopposed as leaders of the Liberal Party. Abbott announced his shadow ministry on 14 September, with few changes to senior positions, but with the return of former leadership rival Malcolm Turnbull, whom he selected as Communications spokesman. Abbott announced that he wanted Turnbull to prosecute the Opposition&#x27;s case against the Gillard government&#x27;s proposed expenditure on a National Broadband Network.

Following the 2010â2011 Queensland floods, Abbott opposed plans by the Gillard government to impose a &quot;flood levy&quot; on taxpayers to fund reconstruction efforts. Abbott said that funding should be found within the existing budget. Abbott announced a proposal for a taskforce to examine further construction of dams in Australia to deal with flood impact and food security.

In February 2011, Abbott criticised the Gillard government&#x27;s handling of health reform and proposal for a 50â50 public hospitals funding arrangement with the states and territories, describing the revised Labor Party proposal as &quot;the biggest surrender since Singapore&quot;. Although Abbott had previously stated that he considered a carbon tax the best way to set a price on carbon, he opposed Prime Minister Gillard&#x27;s February 2011 announcement of a proposal for the introduction of a &quot;carbon tax&quot;, and called on her to take the issue to an election. Abbott said that Gillard had lied to the electorate over the issue because Gillard and her Treasurer Wayne Swan had ruled out the introduction of a carbon tax in the lead up to the 2010 election.

In April 2011, Abbott proposed consultation with Indigenous people over a bipartisan Federal Government intervention in Northern Territory towns including Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek, which would cover such areas as police numbers and school attendance in an effort to address what he described as a &quot;failed state&quot; situation. April saw Abbott announce a $430Â million policy plan to improve the employment prospects of people with serious mental health problems.

Following the first Gillard government budget in May 2011, Abbott used his budget-reply speech to reiterate his critiques of government policy and call for an early election over the issue of a carbon tax. Rhetorically echoing Liberal party founder, Robert Menzies, Abbott addressed remarks to the &quot;forgotten families&quot;.

In June 2011, Abbott for the first time led Gillard in a Newspoll as preferred prime minister. In September 2011, he announced a plan to develop an agricultural food bowl in the north of Australia by developing dams for irrigation and hydroelectricity. Coalition task force leader Andrew Robb claimed that Australia currently produced enough food for 60 million people, but that the Coalition plan could double this to 120Â million people by 2040. The head of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce expressed concerns about the economic and environmental viability of this plan as well as its effects on the indigenous Australian communities in northern Australia.

Reflecting on indigenous issues on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on Australia Day 2012, Abbott said that there had been many positive developments in indigenous affairs in recent decades including Rudd&#x27;s apology and moves to include indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution. Later that day, Abbott became the target of protesters from the &quot;Embassy&quot; after one of Gillard&#x27;s advisers contacted a union official who advised Tent Embassy protesters of Abbott&#x27;s whereabouts and misrepresented Abbott&#x27;s views on Aboriginal affairs to them, saying he intended to &quot;pull down&quot; the embassy. A major security scare resulted, which was broadcast around the world, resulting in Gillard and Abbott being rushed to a government car amid a throng of security due to fears for their safety.

In an address to the National Press Club on 31 January 2012, Abbott outlined some of his plans for government if elected. These included an intent to live one week of every year in an indigenous Australian community, and to prune government expenditure and cut taxes. Abbott also announced &quot;aspirational&quot; targets for a disability insurance scheme and a subsidised dentistry program once the budget had been restored to &quot;strong surplus&quot;.

Abbott responded to the February 2012 Labor leadership crisis by criticising the cross bench independents for keeping Labor in power and renewed his calls for a general election to select the next prime minister of Australia.

In criticising the Gillard government on foreign policy, Abbott said that &quot;foreign policy should have a Jakarta rather than a Geneva focus&quot;. Following his attendance at the 10th anniversary commemoration of the Bali bombing in Bali, Abbott travelled to Jakarta with his Shadow Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Immigration for a meeting with Indonesian president Yudhoyono and Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa. Abbott promised a &quot;no-surprises principle&quot; for dealings with Indonesia. The presidential reception was an unusual occurrence for an opposition leader.

In November 2012, Abbott launched his fourth book, &quot;A Strong Australia&quot;, a compilation of nine of his &quot;landmark speeches&quot; from 2012, including his budget reply and National Press Club addresses.

====Gillard misogyny speech====
On 9 October 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard accused Tony Abbott of misogyny and hypocrisy in a speech to Parliament that gained international notice.

== Prime Minister (2013â2015) ==
=== Early policy implementation ===
At the federal election on 7 September 2013, Abbott led the Liberal-National coalition to victory over the incumbent Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd. Abbott and his ministry were sworn in on 18 September 2013. He was the subject of criticism for his decision to only include one woman, Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop, in his cabinet.

On the first day of the new Parliament, Abbott introduced legislation into Parliament to repeal the Carbon Tax, and commenced Operation Sovereign Borders, the Coalition&#x27;s policy to stop the maritime arrival of asylum seekers, which received strong public support.

Abbott announced a Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption on 11 February 2014. This was followed by amendments to the Fair Work Act, and a &quot;Repeal Day&quot;, where more than 10,000 &quot;red tape&quot; regulations were repealed.

As prime minister, Abbott oversaw free trade agreements signed with Japan, South Korea and China.

The Carbon Tax Repeal Bill passed both houses of Parliament on 17 July 2014 and the Mining Tax Repeal Bill passed both houses of Parliament on 2 September 2014 after negotiations with the Palmer United Party.

=== 2014 budget ===
The 2014 Australian federal budget, the Abbott government&#x27;s first budget, delivered by Treasurer Joe Hockey, was criticised by the Opposition as &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; and a large number of budget saving measures were blocked by the crossbench in the Senate. Hockey and Abbott were both criticised for their inability to &quot;sell&quot; the necessity of the budget cuts to the cross bench or the public. Hockey was further criticised for several &quot;out of touch&quot; and &quot;insensitive&quot; comments in subsequent months, however, the prime minister continuously publicly backed the treasurer, refusing to replace him with a better performing minister.

=== Knighting of Prince Philip===
On 25 March 2014, Abbott announced that he had advised the Queen to reinstate the knight and dame system of honours to the Order of Australia. Outgoing Governor-General Quentin Bryce and her successor, Peter Cosgrove, became the first recipients of the reinstated honours. On Australia Day 2015, Abbott announced that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen&#x27;s husband and a resident of the United Kingdom, would be appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia. This decision was widely criticised, including by members of the government, and fuelled speculation that the prime minister&#x27;s leadership could be challenged. Abbott described the decision as a &quot;captain&#x27;s call&quot;, later admitting that he &quot;probably overdid it on awards&quot;. On 2 November 2015, new prime minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that knights and dames had been removed from the Order of Australia, as &quot;not appropriate in our modern honours system&quot;, although existing titles would not be affected.

=== February 2015 leadership spill ===

On 6 February 2015, Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins announced that he would move a motion, at a meeting of the party room, for a spill of the federal Liberal Party&#x27;s leadership positions. Simpkins stated that such a motion would give Liberal members of parliament and senators the opportunity to either endorse the Prime Minister or &quot;seek a new direction.&quot; The meeting was held on 9 February 2015 and the spill motion was defeated by 61 votes to 39. Both Malcolm Turnbull and deputy leader Julie Bishop were speculated to be considering a leadership run if the spill motion had succeeded. Prime Minister Abbott described the leadership motion as a &quot;near death experience&quot; and declared that &quot;good government starts today&quot;, promising to consult his colleagues more, to shy away from his so-called &quot;captain&#x27;s calls&quot; and to reduce the role of his chief of staff Peta Credlin.

=== Operations against Islamic State ===

Following the Ãle-de-France attacks, the Kuwait mosque bombing and the mass shooting in Sousse, Tunisia, Abbott announced that &quot;Isis is at war with Australia.&quot; Australia had already begun anti-terrorism measures against the group in 2014. However, by September, the Royal Australian Air Force was readying a wing of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, along with an E-7A Wedgetail and KC-30, for operations in Eastern Syria, making strikes against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Australian commitment, known as Operation Okra involved 400 personnel, came at the formal request of President Barack Obama. Australian forces integrated with British Armed Forces, United States Armed Forces and other coalition members within Operation Inherent Resolve. It is understood that Australia&#x27;s air operations were complemented by operations of the 4 Squadron of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment.

=== Choppergate ===
In July 2015, Bronwyn Bishop, who had been successfully nominated by Abbott in November 2013 for the position of Speaker of the House, came under intense media scrutiny after details of her use of taxpayer-funded political entitlements were made public, including chartering a helicopter flight between Melbourne and Geelong to attend a Liberal party fundraiser. Abbott was criticised over his handling of the entitlements scandal as he allowed the controversy to drag on for weeks because of his refusal to sack the Speaker, a close friend and political mentor. Despite Abbott&#x27;s support, Bishop resigned as Speaker on 2 August 2015.

=== Same-sex marriage debate ===
During Abbott&#x27;s prime ministership, Australian law continued to define marriage as a union of a man and a woman, while recognising same-sex couples as de facto couples in areas such as taxation law, social security law, immigration and superannuation, and Abbott did not support changing the law. During Abbott&#x27;s time as opposition leader and prime minister, the position of the Labor Party and opinion polls shifted towards favouring same-sex marriage. Abbott determined that a national plebiscite, rather than a Parliamentary vote should settle the issue.

As an Opposition front bencher in 2008, Abbott wrote: &quot;The love and commitment between two people of the same sex can be as strong as that between husband and wife... There is more moral quality in a relationship between two people devoted to each other for decades than in many a short-lived marriage. Still, however deeply affectionate or long lasting it may be, the relationship between two people of the same sex cannot be a marriage because a marriage, by definition, is between a man and a woman... Let&#x27;s celebrate all strong relationships, whether they are between a man and a woman or between people of the same sex but let&#x27;s be careful about describing every lasting sexual bond as a &#x27;marriage&#x27;.&quot; The First Rudd government and Gillard government held similar views (although the short-lived second Rudd government reversed Labor&#x27;s position on the issue).

Abbott reaffirmed that he did not support changing the law to recognise same-sex marriage, and did not alter Coalition policy on the issue â however he permitted Coalition members to advocate for change if they felt strongly on the issue, and indicated that if a bill were to come before the new parliament, the Coalition party room would discuss its stance on the issue. Opinion polls suggested growing support for change. On 11 August 2015, after renewed debate about same-sex marriage in Australia, Abbott called a Coalition Party room vote and Coalition MPs voted against allowing a free vote on the issue 66 to 33. Some MPs said they were willing to cross the floor on the issue and Abbott was criticised by some pro-gay marriage Liberal MPs, including Christopher Pyne, for holding the vote in the Coalition party room, rather than the Liberal party room (as the inclusion of National Party votes decreased chances of a pro-change outcome). To settle the issue, Abbott proposed a plebiscite following the next election. Although he remained personally opposed to change, he said Parliament should respect the outcome of the national vote on the issue. A national plebiscite regarding same-sex marriage would eventually be held in 2017, under the subsequent Turnbull government.

=== September 2015 leadership spill ===

On 14 September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull, the Minister for Communications, resigned and stated his intention to challenge the Liberal Party leadership in a leadership spill. A party-room meeting held that evening saw Abbott defeated by Turnbull on a 54â44 vote. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Abbott was ousted due to poor opinion polling, lacklustre economic management, and involvement in several political gaffes and scandals. In comments just after the result was announced, Turnbull praised Abbott for his &quot;formidable achievements&quot; as prime minister. By the time he was removed from premiership, Abbott was one of the most unpopular world leaders, and he has been regarded by critics and political experts as one of Australia&#x27;s worst prime ministers.

== Later years in parliament (2015â2019) ==

After Malcolm Turnbull successfully challenged Abbott for the Liberal Party leadership in 2015, Abbott returned to the government backbench and pledged to remain in Parliament. In a final media conference as prime minister, Abbott told reporters: &quot;Leadership changes are never easy for our country. My pledge today is to make this change as easy as I can. There will be no wrecking, no undermining, and no sniping. I&#x27;ve never leaked or backgrounded against anyone. And I certainly won&#x27;t start now [...] I am proud of what the Abbott government has achieved. We stayed focused despite the white-anting [...] The nature of politics has changed in the past decade. A febrile media culture has developed that rewards treachery. If there&#x27;s one piece of advice I can give to the media, it&#x27;s this: refuse to print self-serving claims that the person making them won&#x27;t put his or her name to. Refuse to connive at dishonour by acting as the assassin&#x27;s knife.&quot;

; Turnbull government

Malcolm Turnbull gave the former prime minister no portfolio in the new government. As a backbencher, he continued to defend the record of the Abbott government, and speak out on a range of issues. Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, he backed Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi call for a &quot;revolution in Islam&quot; in a speech in Singapore, and told Sky News, &quot;All of those things that Islam has never had â a Reformation, an Enlightenment, a well-developed concept of the separation of church and state â that needs to happen.&quot; He defended the Abbott government&#x27;s 2014 Budget measures and called on future prime ministers to follow his commitment to spending a week a year in indigenous communities. Abbott declared he would have won the 2016 Election. In a December 2015 editorial, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; accused Abbott of contradicting his undertaking that there would be &quot;no undermining of Malcolm Turnbull&quot;.

On 24 January 2016, Abbott confirmed that he would stand for Liberal preselection for the Division of Warringah in the federal election. He was re-elected with a small swing against him, matching the statewide swing against the Government. Following his re-election, he voiced various concerns about the direction of the Turnbull government. In February 2017, he told a book launch that the Turnbull government was perceived by many conservatives as &quot;Labor lite&quot;, and risked a &quot;drift to defeat&quot; at the upcoming election if it failed to improve its performance. Turnbull&#x27;s ousting of Abbott had divided the Liberal Party rank and file and tensions continued in the parliamentary Party. Abbott said Turnbull supporters had plotted against him.

In the lead up to the 2017 postal survey on same sex marriage, Abbott campaigned for the retention of the status quo. During the campaign, Abbott was headbutted in Hobart by protester Astro Labe, who was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Following the &quot;yes&quot; vote in the plebiscite, Abbott said he accepted the result, and that the matter was settled.

In October 2015, The Australian reported that a &quot;poll of 1631 voters shows 62 per cent of Australians believe the Liberal Party did the right thing&quot; in ousting Abbott. Abbott was returned as the Member for Warringah at the subsequent election, but the Coalition&#x27;s majority in the House of Representatives was reduced from 29 seats to one seat. In April 2018, the now-elected Turnbull government reached the 30-consecutive-Newspoll-losses benchmark Turnbull had used to unseat Abbott. Turnbull resigned after losing the support of the Party in room during the Liberal leadership spills of 2018. Abbott supported Peter Dutton in the leadership vote. Following the election of Scott Morrison as party leader, Abbott said the Coalition now had a better chance of re-election in the upcoming poll, telling the Centre for Independent Studies: &quot;I am confident, given the ministerial appointments that he&#x27;s made, that there will be better policy, there will be a united party, and there will be a sharper difference with our opponents.&quot;

; Morrison government

Following Turnbull&#x27;s resignation, Abbott was appointed as Prime Minister Scott Morrison&#x27;s Special Envoy on Indigenous Affairs, with a brief to focus on indigenous school attendance and performance. Abbott presented his first report to Parliament as Special Envoy in December 2018. He recommended increasing substantially the salary supplements and the retention bonuses for teachers in very remote areas; waiving HECS debt of longer term teachers in very remote schools; incentives for communities to adopt debit card arrangements; an extension of the Remote School Attendance Strategy, with more local school buy-in and engagement; extension of the Good to Great Schools program that has reintroduced phonics and disciplined learning for further evaluation and emulation; and that the government should match the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation&#x27;s private and philanthropic funding on an ongoing basis.

On 18 May 2019, during the federal election, Abbott lost his seat of Warringah to independent candidate and former Olympic skier Zali Steggall, marking the first time the seat had been lost by the Liberals and their predecessors since its creation in 1922. Steggal ran as a pro-climate action candidate and her campaign won extensive media coverage and the backing of the left wing GetUp! lobby group. Abbott went into the election holding Warringah on a two party preferred margin of 61 percent. However, he lost over 12 percent of his primary vote from 2016, and finished over 4,100 votes behind Steggall on the first preference count and over 13,000 after preferences were distributed - losing by 57.2% to 42.8%. Abbott had won the seat at nine elections and served 25 years as the Member for Warringah.

==Post-parliamentary career==

Abbott has been on the board of the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation since 2016. In 2019 he was appointed to the board of the Australian War Memorial.

On 4 September 2020, Abbott was appointed as an adviser to the UK&#x27;s Board of Trade with the stated aim of providing &quot;a range of views to help in its advisory function, promoting free and fair trade and advising on UK trade policy to the International Trade Secretary&quot;. The role involves advising on the negotiation of international trade deals for the UK, but it was reported that Abbott would not be involved in advising the government on the country&#x27;s Brexit process. He will be joined on the board by other senior political figures, including Patricia Hewitt, a former UK Secretary of State for Health, Daniel Hannan, a former Member of the European Parliament, and Linda Yueh, a writer and broadcaster. News of the appointment prompted UK Opposition politicians to question his suitability for the job because of comments previously made by Abbott about climate change, women and same-sex marriage. Boris Johnson, the UK&#x27;s Prime Minister, said that he could not agree with the views of everyone in his government, but that Abbott had been elected as prime minister by that &quot;great, liberal democratic nation of Australia&quot; which he said &quot;speaks for itself&quot;.

=== Possible Senate appointment ===
After the death of Senator Jim Molan, former Victorian Liberal president Michael Kroger in an interview with Sky News Australia suggested the idea of Abbott taking Molan&#x27;s Senate seat. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton told ABC News that there was &quot;no question Tony Abbott would be an asset&quot; but also stated that &quot;there will be many other candidates who are very credible as well&quot;. Abbott has not confirmed whether he is interested in returning to public life.

=== Board appointments ===
In February 2023, Abbott joined the board of UK think-tank Global Warming Policy Foundation which is known for its climate change scepticism.

As of July 2023, he holds the role of a Senior Advisor at New Direction, a think tank affiliated with the European Conservatives and Reformists Party in the European Parliament.

In November 2023, Abbott was appointed to a board seat at Fox Corporation. His nomination came the day after Rupert Murdoch announced his retirement.

== Political views ==
Abbott is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party.

The term &quot;Abbottism&quot; has been coined by several media outlets to refer to his political ideology. Abbottism has been compared to several other eponymous political ideologies, namely Hansonism (the views of Pauline Hanson) and Trumpism (the views of Donald Trump).

=== Aboriginal affairs ===
Abbott has an active interest in indigenous affairs. As Opposition Leader, Abbott promised to prioritise indigenous affairs. As prime minister, Abbott reformed the administration of the portfolio, moving it into the Department of Prime Minister.

As Health Minister, Abbott established the Nurse Family Partnership to improve conditions for indigenous youth. As Opposition Leader, he worked with Cape York Aboriginal activist Noel Pearson, volunteered as a teacher in remote Aboriginal Communities and gave a commitment to continue to live one week a year in such communities if elected prime minister. In contrast to his mentor John Howard, Abbott praised Rudd&#x27;s National Apology to the Stolen Generation.

While the Coalition and Labor were engaged in negotiations with crossbenchers to obtain minority government in 2010, Noel Pearson lobbied Rob Oakeshott to back Abbott. Rising to support the passage of the Gillard government&#x27;s historic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill through the House of Representatives in 2013, Abbott said:

In November 2012, Abbott flew to Alice Springs to back Aboriginal Country Liberal Party (CLP) MLA Alison Anderson to run in the federal seat of Lingiari and to become the first Indigenous woman to enter Parliament. Anderson eventually did not run as the CLP candidate for Lingiari in the 2013 federal election.

In August 2015, he rejected the request of Aboriginal leaders Patrick Dodson and Noel Pearson for the federal government to fund a series of Indigenous-only conventions on the wording for the referendum, citing concerns it could be potentially divisive.

Abbott opposed the Indigenous Voice to Parliament in the 2023 referendum, arguing it would divide Australians. Abbott served on the advisory board of Advance Australia, a conservative lobby group supporting the No campaign against the Voice.

=== Constitutional monarchy ===
Abbott supports the Australian monarchy. Before entering parliament, he worked as the Executive Director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy from 1993 to 1994.

In March 2014, Abbott advised the Queen to reintroduce the grade of Knight/Dame to the Order of Australia, without discussing it in the Cabinet and despite stating in December 2013 that he did not plan to do so. The Fraser government initially introduced the grade of Knight/Dame of the Order of Australia in 1976; the Hawke government discontinued it in 1986.

=== Climate change ===
Before becoming opposition leader, Abbott initially supported proposals by Liberal leaders Howard and Turnbull to introduce floating prices to reduce carbon emissions, but also expressed some doubts as to the science and economics underlying such initiatives. In 2009, Abbott announced his opposition to Turnbull&#x27;s support for the Rudd government&#x27;s Emissions Trading Scheme proposal, and successfully challenged Turnbull for the Liberal leadership, chiefly over this issue. As Opposition Leader, Abbott declared that he accepted that climate change was real and that humans were having an impact on it, but rejected carbon pricing as a means to address the issue, proposing instead to match the Labor government&#x27;s 5% emissions reduction target through implementation of a plan involving financial incentives for emissions reductions by industry, and support for carbon storage in soils and expanded forests. On the eve of the 2013 election, Abbott told the ABC:

Before becoming opposition leader in November 2009, Abbott questioned the science of climate change and an ETS. In November 2009, Abbott outlined his objections to the Rudd government&#x27;s carbon pricing plan on the ABC&#x27;s Lateline program. Upon becoming Leader of the Opposition, Abbott put the question of support for the Government&#x27;s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) to a secret ballot and the Liberal Party voted to reject the policy â overturning an undertaking by Turnbull to support an amended version of the government&#x27;s scheme. Under Abbott, the Coalition joined the Greens and voted against the CPRS in the Senate, and the bill was defeated twice, providing a double dissolution trigger. The Rudd government eventually deferred its CPRS legislation until 2013.

With Abbott as opposition leader, the Liberal party opposed a carbon emissions tax and an Emissions Trading Scheme. Abbott predicted in March 2012 that the Gillard government&#x27;s carbon tax would be the world&#x27;s &quot;biggest&quot;. A January 2013 OECD report on taxation of energy use measured Australia&#x27;s effective tax rate on carbon at 1 July 2012 as among the lower rates in the OECD. In July 2011, Abbott criticised the proposed powers of the government&#x27;s carbon tax regulator.

In October 2017, Abbott spoke in London at the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate-skeptic lobby group, where he described climate change as &quot;probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm.&quot; He argued that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide act as &quot;plant food&quot; and &quot;are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields.&quot;

On 15 December 2019, he claimed that the world was &quot;in the grip of a climate cult&quot;.

===Social policy===
Abbott opposed the legislation of same-sex marriage in Australia. Abbott is an opponent of embryonic stem cell research and euthanasia. He supports the right for women to have an abortion. As Health Minister, he tried, but failed, to block the introduction of the abortion pill RU-486. As Health Minister, Abbott advocated for reducing the number of abortions performed each year as a national priority, and referred to abortion as the &quot;easy way out&quot;. Abbott opposed allowing the introduction of embryonic stem cell research or &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; in a conscience vote.

In his 2009 book &quot;Battlelines&quot;, Abbott proposed that consideration should be given to a return to an optional at-fault divorce agreement between couples who would like it, similar to the &quot;Matrimonial Causes Act&quot;, which would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual drunkenness, cruelty, desertion, or a five-year separation before a divorce would be granted. Abbott said that this would be a way of &quot;providing additional recognition to what might be thought of as traditional marriage&quot;.

Early on in his prime ministership, the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly passed the Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act 2013, a bill to allow same-sex couples to legally marry. Abbott announced that the federal government would challenge this decision in the High Court. The case was heard on 3 December. Nine days later, on 12 December, the High Court gave judgement that the Same Sex Act would be dismantled as it clashed with the Federal Marriage Act 1961. When the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017, which posed the question of whether same-sex couples should be able to marry, was presented to members of parliament, Abbott abstained from voting. Ultimately, same-sex marriage would be passed into law in December 2017.

Abbott supported Peter Dutton&#x27;s call to give &quot;special treatment&quot; to white South African farmers seeking asylum.

=== National Broadband Network ===
Abbott was opposed to a majority Fibre-to-the-Home (FttH) National Broadband Network (NBN). In 2010, as Leader of the Opposition, Abbott stated that he would &quot;ferociously&quot; hold the Labor government to account over what he believed to be &quot;a white elephant on a massive scale&quot; and would &quot;demolish&quot; the NBN.

In 2010, Abbott argued that an LTE network could meet Australia&#x27;s future broadband needs, with &quot;a tower on every street corner&quot;.

In 2011, he called for the NBN to be scrapped entirely with funding diverted to assist with recovery efforts following the Queensland floods, stating &quot;The National Broadband Network is a luxury that Australia cannot now afford. The one thing you don&#x27;t do is redo your bathroom when your roof has just been blown off.&quot;

With Malcolm Turnbull as Shadow Minister for Communications and Broadband, the Liberal/National Coalition proposed an alternative - The Multi-Technology Mix (MTM), which heavily utilised Fibre to the Node (FttN) technology - in the lead up to the 2013 Australian federal election. Abbott said that if elected, all Australians would have access to a minimum broadband speed of 25Â Mbit/s by the end of their first term of government. They promised download speeds between 25 and 100Â Mbit/s by the end of 2016 and 50 to 100Â Mbit/s by 2019, with the rollout completed by the end of 2019.

===China and Taiwan===
Abbott called the AUKUS (Australia, United Kingdom and United States) defence pact, which is directed at countering Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region, &quot;the biggest decision that any Australian government has made in decades&quot; as &quot;it indicates that we are going to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States and the United Kingdom in meeting the great strategic challenge of our time, which obviously, is China&quot;. Abbott said that Australia would be safer as a result, and cited China&#x27;s increasing naval firepower as a justification for the deal.

Abbott strongly supports the &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation. In 2021, Abbott attended a regional forum hosted in Taipei and met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. During a speech, he stated that he wants to help Taiwan end its isolation from global affairs and reaffirmed Australia&#x27;s solidarity with the country amid increasing tensions with China. In the speech, he also referred to China as a &quot;bully&quot; and Chinese President Xi Jinping as &quot;the new red emperor&quot;. Chinese officials highly criticised Abbott&#x27;s visit and speech, although Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his government defended his visit.

==Personal life==
In March 2020, an Australian computer security researcher obtained Abbott&#x27;s passport number and personal phone number after Abbott posted a photo of his aeroplane boarding pass on Instagram. The researcher found a security flaw in the online check-in portal of the airline carrier Qantas, that divulged sensitive information given details printed on the pass.

Abbott has admitted to having smoked cannabis once.

In September 2021, during the second COVID-19 lockdown in Sydney, Abbott was fined $500 for not wearing a mask in breach of COVID-19 health orders.

===Marriage and children===
When Abbott was 22, his girlfriend at the time became pregnant and claimed he was the biological father. The couple did not marry and put the child up for adoption. For 27 years, Abbott believed that he was the father of the child. In 2004, the man sought out Abbott, and it was publicly revealed he was an ABC sound recordist who worked in Parliament House, Canberra, and was involved in making television programmes in which Abbott appeared. The story was reported around the world, but DNA testing later revealed that Abbott was not the man&#x27;s father.

Following his departure from the seminary, Abbott met and married Margaret &quot;Margie&quot; Aitken, a New Zealander working in Sydney. The couple have three daughters (Louise, Bridget and Frances), and became grandparents in 2021.

=== Religion ===
Abbott is a Roman Catholic. Before the 2013 Election, Abbott spoke of his religious outlook:
As a former Catholic seminarian, Abbott&#x27;s religiosity has come to national attention and journalists have often sought his views on the role of religion in politics. According to John Warhurst of the Australian National University, academics have at times placed an &quot;exaggerated concentration on the religious affiliation and personal religious background of just one of [the Howard government&#x27;s] senior ministers, Tony Abbott.&quot; Journalist Michelle Grattan wrote in 2010 that while Abbott has always &quot;worn his Catholicism on his sleeve&quot;, he is &quot;clearly frustrated by the obsession with [it] and what might hang off that&quot;. Abbott has said that a politician should not rely on religion to justify a political point of view:
Various political positions supported by Abbott have been criticised by church representatives, including aspects of Coalition industrial relations, asylum seeker, and Aboriginal affairs policies. After criticisms of Liberal Party policy by clergy, Abbott has said, &quot;The priesthood gives someone the power to consecrate bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. It doesn&#x27;t give someone the power to convert poor logic into good logic.&quot;

== Community service ==

Abbott is an active volunteer member for the Davidson, NSW Rural Fire Service. He is also an active volunteer member of the Queenscliff Surf Life Saving Club.

Abbott participates in the Pollie Pedal, an annual 1,000Â km charity bike ride. In April 2007, he launched the tenth annual Pollie Pedal, to raise money for breast cancer research.

In 2008, Abbott spent three weeks teaching in a remote Aboriginal settlement in Coen on Cape York, organised through Indigenous leader Noel Pearson. He taught remedial reading to Aboriginal children and worked with an income management group helping families manage their welfare payments. In 2009, he spent 10 days in Aurukun on Cape York working with the truancy team, visiting children who had not been attending school. Abbott&#x27;s stated goal for these visits was to familiarise himself with Indigenous issues.

== Writings ==
Abbott has published four books. In 2009, he launched &quot;Battlelines&quot;; a personal biography, reflections on the Howard government and discussion of potential policy directions for the Liberal Party of Australia. Previously he had published two books in defence of the existing constitutional monarchy system, &quot;The Minimal Monarchy&quot; and &quot;How to Win the Constitutional War&quot;. In 2012, he released a compilation of key speeches from that year, entitled &quot;A Strong Australia&quot;.

<text>Dick Godfrey Harry Adams (born 29 April 1951) is a former Australian politician who served as a Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives. He represented the Division of Lyons in central Tasmania from the 1993 federal election until the 2013 federal election. He was born in Launceston, Tasmania, and was a meat worker, rural worker and an organiser with the Australasian Meat Industry Employees&#x27; Union and the Liquor and Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers&#x27; Union (Miscellaneous Division) before entering politics. He is currently serving as a councillor on Northern Midlands Council

Adams was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Franklin division from the 1979 state election until the 1982 state election, serving as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 1980 until 1981, and as Minister for National Parks, Lands, Aged Persons and Community Welfare from 1981 until 1982.

Since being elected to the federal parliament, Adams played an active role in the conduct of Parliamentary affairs. He was a member of the Speakers&#x27; Panel from 1996 to 2013. He also participated in a number of Parliamentary Standing Committees, including the Parliamentary Library joint committee which he served as a member and chair from 2006. From 2007 he was the chairman of the Primary Industries and Resources Standing Committee and the National Capital and External Territories Standing Committee, and was an inaugural member of the Standing Committee on Petitions which was established to receive and process petitions to the Federal Parliament from citizens and groups. Adams was also on the Joint Committee for Public Accounts &amp; Audit, Standing Committee of Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries, and Forestry, and Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence &amp; Trade and all relevant sub committeesâAdams was the only member of parliament to sit on all of the Foreign Affairs, Defence &amp; Trade committees.

Adams was narrowly defeated by Liberal candidate Eric Hutchinson at the 2013 election suffering a 13.5 percent two-party swing, the largest in the nation.

Adams was a National Ambassador of the National Year of Reading for 2012.

In 2019, Dick Adams was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to Australian and Tasmanian Parliaments, and to adult literacy.

<doc id="556743" wikidata="Q444705" url="?curid=556743" title="Mary Coughlan (politician)">
<text>Mary Coughlan (born 28 May 1965) is an Irish former Fianna FÃ¡il politician who served as TÃ¡naiste from 2008 to 2011, Deputy leader of Fianna FÃ¡il from 2008 to 2011, Minister for Health and Children from January 2011 to March 2011, Minister for Education and Skills from 2010 to 2011, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from 2008 to 2010, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food from 2004 to 2008, Minister for Social and Family Affairs from 2002 to 2004 and Minister of State for the Gaeltacht and the Islands from 2001 to 2002. She served as a Teachta DÃ¡la (TD) for the Donegal South-West constituency from 1987 to 2011.

==Early life==
Coughlan was born in Donegal Town in the south of County Donegal in May 1965. Her father was Cathal Coughlan, a Fianna FÃ¡il TD, who died in office in June 1986. She was educated at: Ballydevitt National School, on the outskirts of Donegal Town; the Ursuline College in Sligo, where she was a boarder from 1978 to 1983; and later at University College Dublin (UCD), graduating with a Social Science degree. She worked as a social worker for a brief period before becoming involved in politics.

==Political career==
===Early political life===
Coming from a political family, Coughlan was always interested in politics and joined a Fianna FÃ¡il &quot;Cumann&quot; (a local party branch) at the age of 16. She was first elected to DÃ¡il Ãireann at the 1987 general election as a Fianna FÃ¡il TD for the Donegal South-West constituency. At the age of 21 years and nine months, Coughlan was the youngest member of the 25th DÃ¡il. Her uncle Clement Coughlan was a TD from 1980 until his death in 1983 in a road traffic accident, while her father Cathal Coughlan was a TD from 1983 to 1986 when he died after a short illness. The death of her father resulted in Coughlan being co-opted onto Donegal County Council in 1986, which launched her political career.

She remained on the backbenches of the DÃ¡il for the first thirteen years of her career as a TD, before being appointed a junior Minister. During this period she served on several Oireachtas committees, including the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Joint Committee on the Irish language where she served as chairperson. Coughlan was also a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body. In 1994, Bertie Ahern became leader of Fianna FÃ¡il and Leader of the Opposition. In early 1995 he named his new front bench, including Coughlan as Spokesperson on Educational Reform. She served in this position until 1997 but was not included in the cabinet or junior ministerial team when the party came to power.

===Minister of State===
In February 2001, Coughlan was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and Islands. In this role for just sixteen months, she was responsible for securing Government approval for the general scheme of the Official Languages Equality Bill, which aimed to confirm the language rights of citizens and outline their rights when dealing with the State in either official language. She also oversaw the coming-into-force of an amended Gaeltacht Housing Act, updating the supports available for Irish-speaking households building in or moving to the Gaeltacht. The Commission on Irish in the Gaeltacht () also completed its work under her guidance and Coughlan saw its report approved and published. During her time in this role, she also established a Working Group on the Creation of Employment in the Gaeltacht. In addition, during her tenure Coughlan oversaw significant investment in island infrastructure and the connection of islands to the national electricity grid, including Inishbofin Island, off the County Donegal coast, which was connected for the first time in 2002 by using an underwater cable from the mainland.

===Cabinet career (2002â2011)===
====Minister for Social and Family Affairs (2002â2004)====
After the 2002 general election Coughlan was promoted to the cabinet as Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Her time in Social and Family Affairs saw increases in social welfare payments and the extension of family support. She established the Family Support Agency with a mandate to support families, promote stability in family life, prevent marital breakdown and foster a supportive community environment for families at a local level.

Coughlan received criticism for changes she made regarding the availability of rent supplements. This was portrayed as targeting the weaker sections of society at a time when the Irish economy was reasonably strong. She was also widely criticised for cuts she made as Minister to entitlements for widows and widowers after the death of a spouse. The cuts were part of a wider drive for a reduction in government spending in the autumn of 2002. However, many considered these and other similar cutbacks to have been forced upon her by Charlie McCreevy, who was Minister for Finance at the time, and who was blamed for many of his decisions. She was also involved in resolving a dispute over payments with the country&#x27;s dentists.

During her time as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Coughlan was praised for introducing large increases in child benefits and pensions. Her work on the pensions element of her portfolio also saw her introduce Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. Coughlan also established the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and provided additional funding and support for the State&#x27;s Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).

====Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (2004â2008)====
In a 2004 reshuffle, Coughlan succeeded Joe Walsh as Minister for Agriculture and Food, becoming the first woman to hold that portfolio in the Republic of Ireland (her fellow Donegal woman, BrÃ­d Rodgers, had become the first woman to be appointed as a full-ranking Agriculture Minister in Ireland when she had been appointed Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the Northern Ireland Executive in December 1999, serving until October 2002).

During her time in this role the country&#x27;s last two remaining sugar factories, owned by Greencore, were closed. The Carlow factory closed on 11 March 2005. Mallow, Ireland&#x27;s last sugar factory to remain open, closed on 12 May 2006, after operating for 77 years. Farmers and others were critical of the decision. They criticised the government&#x27;s and the Minister&#x27;s roles, both were seen as not doing enough to try to stop the closures, though they had retained some control over the factories since they had been privatised several years before. As sugar beet growers now had nowhere to sell their sugar beet, cultivation of the crop ceased in Ireland. Coughlan also headed this department at a time when the spread of bird flu from abroad looked very likely to occur, especially in 2006.

Coughlan was re-appointed to the portfolio on 14 June 2007 following the 2007 general election, with the additional responsibility of fisheries as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Shortly after her re-appointment Coughlan had to put in place measures to deal with the threat of the potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease from Great Britain in early August 2007.

Throughout her time in this ministry, Coughlan was involved in ongoing WTO trade talks. During these trade talks, in which Irish agriculture was threatened by attacks on EU farm subsidies and free access to EU markets, she allied with French ministers to resist the proposals.

====TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (2008â2010)====
Following Bertie Ahern&#x27;s resignation on 6 May 2008, Coughlan, in a cabinet re-shuffle, became TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 7 May 2008, by newly appointed Taoiseach Brian Cowen.

As a proponent of the Treaty of Lisbon, Coughlan was noted to have &quot;quietly withdrawn&quot; from the first referendum campaign after she embarrassed the Government in a radio interview by not knowing the number of European Commissioners. Over a period of four days Coughlan stated that the EU&#x27;s larger nations still had two Commissioners each. In fact, the bigger states had lost their second places on the Commission in 2004. According to an editorial in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;how someone who had spent several years around an EU Council of Ministers&#x27; table could not know that is extraordinary&quot;.

Responding to a row over medical cards she displayed insufficient mathematical skill, saying &quot;Of the savings of â¬100 million, â¬86 million is for GPs and â¬30 million is for pharmacists&quot;.

Her performance as TÃ¡naiste in defence of the October 2008 budget was criticised by opposition politicians and the media, with Fine Gael&#x27;s Leo Varadkar publicly comparing Coughlan to gaffe-prone Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin. Varadkar&#x27;s comments were challenged by broadcaster John Bowman and &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; journalist Justine McCarthy, as well as by Coughlan herself.

Coughlan announced a third change in the budgetary position, in her local constituency, before cabinet agreement and five days before the responsible Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced it to the nation, via RTÃ Radio.

Coughlan acted to clean up years of wasteful spending by executives at FÃS, the state training and employment agency, and was considered to have taken a tough line with Director General, Rody Molloy, who was forced to resign in November 2008.

The 2008 fall in the value of sterling against the euro saw the price gap between North and South widen and shoppers cross to Northern Ireland to the perceived detriment of businesses within the Republic of Ireland. Coughlan asked multiple retailers within the Republic to reduce their margins and provide better value to consumers in the Republic. Research from ForfÃ¡s, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers&#x27; larger margins in the Republic about their operations in the North, and Coughlan queried why the price differential in many identical goods was substantially more than 5%. Coughlan said: &quot;I don&#x27;t own a shop. The Government doesn&#x27;t own a shop. It&#x27;s up to Tesco, it&#x27;s up to Superquinn, it&#x27;s up to Aldi, it&#x27;s up to Lidl; it&#x27;s up to them to cut their prices. They need to ensure that that happens; they have to do something about it.&quot; When retailers continued to remain silent on the price differential, Coughlan sent in the Competition Authority to investigate supply chains in the retail sector.

Coughlan was condemned for doing &quot;too little too late&quot; in relation to large-scale loss of employment at a Dell facility in Limerick, despite successfully retaining 2,000 Dell employees in Ireland. She also successfully secured over â¬22 million of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund money to the benefit of the workers made redundant in Limerick.

Coughlan was accused by an opposition spokesperson of being unable to debate exchequer figures.

Coughlan acted to close loopholes in company law that made it possible for bank directors not to have to disclose the full extent of their indebtedness to the bank in its published accounts. She also strengthened the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to enforce company law provisions.

On 24 April 2009, one of Coughlan&#x27;s demoted junior ministers, John McGuinness, criticised Coughlan and Cowen for the lack of leadership being given to the country, saying: &quot;She&#x27;s not equipped to deal with the complex issues of dealing with enterprise and business within the department. And neither is the department&quot;. McGuinness&#x27; credibility was subsequently undermined when it was revealed that he had hired external PR advice in an effort to undermine Coughlan and enhance his own profile as a Minister of State within her department.

In April 2009, she denied there would be a supplementary budget â one was announced five days later â also claiming that the public finances were under control at the same time.

In September that year Coughlan was described as &quot;Calamity Coughlan&quot;, having been left red-faced after erroneously referring to the theory of evolution as having been formulated by Einstein. Later that month she apparently let slip the date of a general election while speaking about the budget when Brian Cowen was in New York. She also called her Green Party colleagues &quot;&quot; â Irish language for &quot;the vegetables&quot;.

====Minister for Education and Skills (2010â2011)====
On 23 March 2010, as part of a cabinet reshuffle, she was appointed as Minister for Education and Skills, while retaining the position of TÃ¡naiste. One of Coughlan&#x27;s first initiatives in the portfolio was to voice her support for the introduction of a CAO points bonus for students studying higher level maths. She revamped the Student Maintenance Grant application procedure, streamlining administration and getting the scheme out two months earlier than in previous years. Following the resignation of Mary Harney in January 2011, Coughlan was also appointed as Minister for Health and Children.

===Loss of seat===
At the 2011 general election, Coughlan lost her seat to Independent candidate Thomas Pringle. Her first preference vote more than halved from 26.5% in 2007 to just over 11%. Her running mate Brian Ã Domhnaill also failed to be elected, leaving Donegal South-West without a Fianna FÃ¡il TD for the first time in its history. The loss of her seat was considered the most high-profile casualty of the Fianna FÃ¡il meltdown. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper described it as &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Portillo moment&quot;. Coughlan received a lump sum of â¬237,000, and an annual pension of â¬140,000. In 2022, Coughlan stepped back into public life when she was appointed Chair of the National Conference on Women in Farming by her successor as Donegal Fianna FÃ¡il TD, the Minister for Agriculture, Charlie McConalogue.

==Views on LGBT rights==
During her time as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Coughlan became involved in several LGBT rights controversies. In March 2004, she introduced the Social Welfare Amendment Act 2004 in response to a case involving same-sex partner benefits. Under the Equal Status Act 2000, a gay pensioner successfully petitioned the Equality Authority to allow his male partner to travel as his &#x27;spouse&#x27; using the pensioner&#x27;s travel pass. The legislation which Coughlan subsequently produced limited the meaning of the word &#x27;spouse&#x27; to include only married couples; this was regarded by the Opposition parties and LGBT rights campaigners as discriminatory towards same-sex couples as there had been no legal recognition of same-sex unions in the Republic of Ireland at the time. Two months later, Coughlan caused comment at a European Union conference on family and social policy by stating that Ireland would never be ready for same-sex marriage or gay adoption.

During her time in Social and Family Affairs, Coughlan produced a report discussing new definitions of &#x27;the family&#x27; which recommended a more progressive approach to the matter. This influenced the government&#x27;s 2008 civil union legislation.

==Personal life==
Coughlan is a fluent Irish speaker. 
In 1991 Coughlan married David Charlton, a Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na officer who was working at Leinster House. Several years after their marriage, Charlton was seriously injured in a car accident, losing his leg. The couple have two children - a son and a daughter. They lived at Frosses, a village just west of Donegal town. Charlton died from cancer on 2 September 2012.

Coughlan served as secretary of the St Naul&#x27;s GAA club.

<doc id="556745" wikidata="Q335697" url="?curid=556745" title="Anthony Albanese">
<text>Anthony Norman Albanese ( or ; born 2 March 1963) is an Australian politician who is the 31st and current prime minister of Australia since 2022. He has been the leader of the Labor Party (ALP) since 2019 and a member of parliament (MP) for the New South Wales division of Grayndler since 1996. Albanese previously served as the 15th deputy prime minister under the second Rudd government in 2013. He held various ministerial positions from 2007 to 2013 in the governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard.

Albanese was born in Sydney to an Italian father and an Irish-Australian mother, who raised him as a single parent. Albanese attended St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral College and studied economics at the University of Sydney. As a student, he joined the Labor Party and later worked as a party official and research officer before entering Parliament.

Albanese was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1996 election, winning the seat of Grayndler in New South Wales. He was first appointed to the shadow cabinet in 2001 by Simon Crean and went on to serve in a number of roles, eventually becoming Manager of Opposition Business in 2006. After Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2007 election, Albanese was appointed Leader of the House, and was also made Minister for Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. In the subsequent leadership tensions between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2010 to 2013, Albanese was publicly critical of the conduct of both, calling for party unity. After supporting Rudd in the final leadership ballot between the two in June 2013, Albanese was elected the deputy leader of the Labor Party and sworn in as deputy prime minister the following day, a position he held for less than three months, as Labor was defeated at the 2013 election.

Rudd retired from politics, so Albanese stood against Bill Shorten in the October 2013 Australian Labor Party leadership election. Although Albanese won a large majority of the membership, Shorten won more heavily among Labor MPs and became leader. Shorten subsequently appointed Albanese to his Shadow Cabinet. After Labor&#x27;s surprise defeat in the 2019 election, Shorten resigned as leader, with Albanese becoming the only person nominated in the leadership election to replace him; he was subsequently elected unopposed as leader of the Labor Party, becoming Leader of the Opposition.

In the 2022 election, Albanese led his party to victory against Scott Morrison&#x27;s Liberal-National Coalition. He was sworn in on 23 May 2022. Albanese&#x27;s first acts as prime minister included proposing a change to the Constitution to include an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, updating Australia&#x27;s climate targets to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and supporting an increase to the national minimum wage. Albanese led his government&#x27;s response to Australia&#x27;s cost-of-living crisis caused by the 2021â2023 inflation surge, created the National Anti-Corruption Commission, made major changes to Australian labour law, introduced a ban on children under the age of sixteen from using social media platforms, established the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme and expanded paid parental leave. In foreign policy, Albanese pledged further logistical support to Ukraine to assist with the Russo-Ukrainian war, attempted to strengthen relations in the Pacific region, and oversaw an easing of tensions and trade restrictions put on Australia by China. He also administered the official commencement of the AUKUS security pact between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

== Early life ==
=== Family and background ===
Albanese was born on 2 March 1963 at St Margaret&#x27;s Hospital in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst. He is the son of Carlo Albanese and Maryanne Ellery (1936â2002). His mother was an Australian of Irish descent, while his Italian father was from Barletta in Apulia, Southern Italy. His parents met in March 1962 on a voyage from Sydney to Southampton, England, on the Sitmar Line&#x27;s TSS &quot;Fairsky&quot;, where his father worked as a steward, but did not continue their relationship afterwards, going their separate ways. Albanese&#x27;s mother adopted Carlo&#x27;s surname for herself and named Anthony after his cousin Anthony Howett, who had died in a car accident in Northern New South Wales four years earlier.

Growing up, Albanese was told that his father had died in a car accident; he did not meet his father, who was in fact still alive, until 2009, tracking him down initially with the assistance of John Faulkner, Carnival Australia&#x27;s CEO Ann Sherry (the parent company of P&amp;O, which acquired the Sitmar Line in 1988) and maritime historian Rob Henderson, and then later the Australian Embassy in Italy and ambassador Amanda Vanstone. He made contact with his father in 2009, visiting him a number of times in Italy, and also took his family there. His father died in 2014. He subsequently discovered that he had two half-siblings. During the Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis of 2017, it was noted that, although birth to an Italian father would ordinarily confer citizenship by descent, Albanese had no father recorded on his birth certificate and thus meets the parliamentary eligibility requirements of section 44 of the Constitution.

=== Childhood and education ===
Albanese grew up with his mother and maternal grandparents in a Sydney City Council home in the Inner West suburb of Camperdown, opposite the Camperdown Children&#x27;s Hospital. His grandfather died in 1970, and the following year his mother married James Williamson. He was given his stepfather&#x27;s surname, but the marriage lasted only 10 weeks, as Williamson proved to be an abusive alcoholic. Albanese&#x27;s mother worked part-time as a cleaner but suffered from chronic rheumatoid arthritis, with the family surviving on her disability pension and his grandmother&#x27;s age pension.

Albanese attended St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School in Camperdown and then St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral College. In 1979, at 15 years old, Albanese joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP). After finishing school, he worked for the Commonwealth Bank for two years before studying economics at the University of Sydney. There, he became involved in student politics and was elected to the Students&#x27; Representative Council. It was also there where he started his rise as a key player in the ALP&#x27;s Labor Left. During his time in student politics, Albanese led a group within Young Labor that was aligned with the left faction&#x27;s Hard Left, which maintained &quot;links with broader left-wing groups, such as the Communist Party of Australia, People for Nuclear Disarmament and the African National Congress&quot;.

=== Pre-parliamentary career and travel ===
After completing his economics degree in 1984, Albanese took on a role as a research officer to the then Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services, Tom Uren, who became a mentor to him. In 1989, the position of Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party became vacant when John Faulkner was elected to the Senate. The election to replace him was closely disputed between the Labor Left&#x27;s Hard Left and Soft Left groupings, with Albanese being elected with the backing of the Hard Left, taking on that role for the next six years. In 1995, he left the position to work as a senior adviser to New South Wales Premier Bob Carr.

Albanese&#x27;s first overseas trip was in 1986, accompanying his friend Jeremy Fisher to Vanuatu. In 1987, Albanese joined his boss Tom Uren on a visit to South-East Asia, which included: a meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok, Thailand; an Anzac Day dawn service at the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery with John Carrick; and a tour of Cambodia alongside Bill Hayden&#x27;s daughter Ingrid. He then travelled extensively in 1988, visiting Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Western Europe on a Contiki tour, and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia as a backpacker. Upon returning to Australia, he began dating Carmel Tebbutt, with whom he would holiday in Europe and South-East Asia, plus a backpacking trip to India in 1991. Sometime during his 20s, Albanese also took part in a tour of the United States by the U.S. State Department, with a thematic focus on the interaction of advocacy groups with the U.S. Government.

In 1990, Albanese bought a semi-detached two-bedroom house in the Inner West Sydney suburb of Marrickville.

== Early political career ==
=== Entry to Parliament ===

When Jeannette McHugh announced she would not seek re-election in her seat of Grayndler at the 1996 election, Albanese won preselection for the seat. The campaign was a difficult one, with aircraft noise a big political issue following the opening of the third runway at Sydney Airport, and the newly established No Aircraft Noise party (NAN) having polled strongly in the local area at the 1995 New South Wales election. Veteran political pundit Malcolm Mackerras predicted NAN would win the seat. However, NAN&#x27;s candidate finished third, with less than 14% of the vote. Despite suffering a six-point swing against Labor, Albanese was elected with a comfortable 16-point margin.

In his maiden speech to the House of Representatives, he spoke about the building of a third runway at Sydney Airport, aircraft noise and the need to build a second airport to service Sydney, as well as his support for funding public infrastructure in general, multiculturalism, native title, the social wage and childcare. He concluded by saying, &quot;For myself, I will be satisfied if I can be remembered as someone who will stand up for the interests of my electorate, for working-class people, for the labour movement, and for our progressive advancement as a nation into the next century.&quot;

In his first year in Parliament he continued this theme, speaking in favour of the Northern Territory&#x27;s euthanasia legislation, the rights of the Indigenous community in the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy, and entitlement to superannuation for same-sex couples.

This last issue became a cause to which he was particularly dedicated. In 1998 he unsuccessfully moved a private member&#x27;s bill that would have given same-sex couples the same rights to superannuation as de facto heterosexual couples. Over the next nine years, he tried three more times without success, until the election of the Rudd government in 2007 saw the legislation passed. Albanese subsequently turned his attention to campaigning for same-sex marriage.

=== Appointment to Shadow Cabinet ===

In 1998, Albanese was appointed a parliamentary secretary, a position which assists ministers and shadow ministers and is often a stepping stone to a full ministerial position.

In 2001, Albanese was promoted to the opposition Shadow Cabinet, taking the portfolio of ageing and seniors. A 2002 reshuffle saw him become Shadow Minister for Employment Services and Training, and in 2004 he became Shadow Minister for Environment and Heritage. It was during this latter role that then prime minister John Howard and science minister Brendan Nelson started raising the idea of nuclear power for Australia. Albanese campaigned strongly against them, as well as elements within his own party, arguing that &quot;Nuclear energy doesn&#x27;t add up economically, environmentally or socially, and after more than 50 years of debate, we still do not have an answer to nuclear proliferation or nuclear waste.&quot;

In 2005, Albanese was given the additional role of Shadow Minister for Water alongside his existing responsibilities, and was also appointed Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House. In December 2006, when Kevin Rudd first became Leader of the Labor Party, Albanese took over from Julia Gillard as Manager of Opposition Business in the House, a senior tactical role on the floor of the parliament, and was appointed Shadow Minister for Water and Infrastructure.

== Cabinet minister ==
=== Rudd government ===
Following Labor&#x27;s victory at the 2007 election, Albanese&#x27;s rise in standing within the party was evidenced by his appointment as Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Minister for Regional Development and Local Government and Leader of the House in the Rudd ministry. Rudd was sworn in alongside his colleagues on 3 December 2007.

The Labor Party had gone to the election criticising the previous government for ignoring &quot;long-term nation building in favour of short-term political spending&quot;. One of Albanese&#x27;s first moves as Minister for Infrastructure and Transport was the establishment of an independent statutory body, Infrastructure Australia, to advise the Government on infrastructure priorities. Armed with advice from this independent body and his own persuasive skills in the Cabinet, he was able to argue for a doubling of the roads budget and a tenfold increase in rail investment. The establishment of Infrastructure Australia was regarded by many as a success; projects delivered through the Infrastructure Australia process included Melbourne&#x27;s Regional Rail Link, the Hunter Expressway, the Ipswich Motorway, the Gold Coast light rail system , the Redcliffe Peninsula railway line, the extension of the Noarlunga Centre railway line to Seaford, South Australia and various projects along the Pacific Highway in NSW and Bruce Highway in Queensland.

=== Gillard government ===

After Julia Gillard replaced Rudd as prime minister following the leadership spill in June 2010 she retained Albanese in his roles. Following the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament, Albanese was a key player in negotiating the support of independent members Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott through his role of Leader of the House. Albanese was also responsible for managing legislation through the House in the first hung parliament since the 1940s.

In 2011, Albanese introduced two more major policy reforms. The first on urban planning drew on the work of Danish designer Jan Gehl and set out plans for urban design with better transport links and safety. The second, on shipping, was notable for gaining the approval of both the conservative Australian Shipowners Associations and the radical Maritime Union of Australia. However, he also attracted controversy when a convoy of trucks from North Queensland dubbed the &quot;convoy of no confidence&quot; descended on Canberra&#x27;s Parliament House to protest against rising fuel costs and carbon pricing. During question time, Albanese labelled the protesters outside as &quot;the convoy of no consequence&quot;. This caused outrage among supporters of the protest and a week later a public rally in support of the truckies was held outside Albanese&#x27;s electorate office in , New South Wales.

Following a series of poor polls, leadership instability descended again on the Labor government. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd resigned as Minister for Foreign Affairs in February 2012 to unsuccessfully challenge Julia Gillard for the leadership. Shortly before the ballot, Albanese came out in support of Rudd, stating that he had always been unhappy with the manner of Rudd&#x27;s removal. He tearfully explained how he had offered his resignation as Leader of the House to the prime minister, but that she had refused to accept it, and called on Labor to cease leadership divisions and unify. In response to a question on his personal feelings around the leadership spill, he stated &quot;I like fighting Tories. That&#x27;s what I do.&quot;

=== Deputy Prime Minister of Australia ===

In June 2013, Rudd defeated Gillard in a final leadership election. That same ballot saw Albanese elected by the caucus as Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, and the following day Albanese was sworn in as deputy prime minister. He held this role until Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2013 election, and was replaced by Warren Truss on 18 September.

== Return to Opposition ==
=== 2013 leadership election ===
Following the defeat of Labor at the 2013 election, Albanese announced his candidacy to be Leader of the Labor Party, standing against Bill Shorten. Shorten was announced as the winner after a month-long contest that was the first to involve a combined vote of MPs and rank-and-file members. Although Albanese won comfortably among party members, Shorten held a greater lead among MPs, and was subsequently elected.

=== Shorten Opposition ===
In October 2013, shortly after the leadership election, Shorten appointed Albanese Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Shadow Minister for Tourism; he held these roles throughout Shorten&#x27;s time as leader. In September 2014, Albanese was given the additional role of Shadow Minister for Cities. Following Labor&#x27;s narrow loss in the 2016 federal election, it was reported by Sky News that Albanese was preparing to challenge Shorten for the leadership of the party. However, Albanese ruled out such a challenge, and Shorten was re-elected unopposed as Labor leader.

== Leader of the Opposition (2019â2022) ==

=== 2019 leadership election ===
Bill Shorten announced his resignation as Leader of the Labor Party on 18 May 2019, following Labor&#x27;s unexpected defeat in the 2019 election. The day after, Albanese announced his candidacy in the subsequent leadership election. On 21 May, Chris Bowen announced he would also contest the ballot; however, the next day, he announced his withdrawal, citing his lack of support among the party membership. With no other candidate stepping forward, Albanese took the leadership unopposed on 30 May, with Richard Marles as his deputy. Aged 56 when he took office, he became the oldest first-time Opposition Leader in 59 years, since Arthur Calwell (aged 63) took office in 1960. Albanese unveiled his shadow ministry on 1 June 2019.

=== 2022 federal election ===
Albanese led the Labor Party into the 2022 federal election. On the first day of campaigning, Albanese was unable to name either the official cash rate or unemployment rate, which drew criticism. On 20 April, Albanese faced prime minister Scott Morrison in a debate hosted by Sky News, with Albanese being deemed the winner through an audience vote. However, the next day, Albanese tested positive for COVID-19, forcing him to isolate at home in Sydney. He returned to campaigning the following week and, on 1 May, hosted Labor&#x27;s campaign launch in Perth which was the first time any major party launched in Western Australia. At the launch, Labor unveiled policies to reduce the cost of medicine and childcare, increase manufacturing in Australia, and introduce a shared equity housing scheme to assist first-time home buyers. Albanese faced Morrison in two further debates, hosted by Channel Nine and Channel Seven, respectively. Opinion polling indicated that support for the two major parties had reached record lows, due to high levels of support for minor parties and independent candidates.

== Prime Minister of Australia (2022âpresent) ==
At the election on 21 May 2022, Labor was victorious over the incumbent Liberal-National Coalition, with Albanese becoming the 31st prime minister of Australia. Despite a decrease in the party&#x27;s primary vote, Labor received a 3.66 percent two-party preferred swing towards it. The Coalition also lost several seats to &quot;teal independents&quot;, allowing Labor to become the party with the most seats in Parliament.

Although it was not certain on election day that Labor would win a majority of seats, it soon became apparent that no other party could realistically form a government. Accordingly, two days after the election, Albanese, deputy Labor leader Richard Marles, Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher were sworn in as an interim five-person ministry. Albanese is the first Italian-Australian prime minister in the country&#x27;s history.

Albanese secured confidence and supply from several crossbenchers in the event that he was unable to form majority government. However, on 30 May, it was projected that Labor had won at least 76 seats, enough to win a majority for the first time at the federal level since the 2007 election. Albanese&#x27;s full ministry was sworn in on 1 June.

=== Domestic affairs ===
====Economy and taxation====
Albanese&#x27;s first term has been dominated by Australia&#x27;s cost-of-living crisis, which has been attributed to the worldwide inflation surge of 2021â23. Monthly inflation peaked at a high of 8.4% in December 2022, and the Reserve Bank of Australia increased interest rates twelve times, reaching a rate of 4.35% by November 2023, the highest since 2011. In the 2023 Australian federal budget, the Albanese government delivered a surplus of $22.1 billion (equivalent to 0.9% of Australia&#x27;s GDP); this was Australia&#x27;s first budget surplus in 15 years, and the largest ever Australian budget surplus. In the 2024 budget, the government posted a second consecutive surplus of $9.3 billion.

In January 2024, the Albanese government made changes to the previously legislated stage three tax cuts, which would see individuals earning less than A$150,000 receive a larger tax cut than under the original plan. These changes were met with some criticism, particularly by the Opposition and conservative media outlets, and was viewed as a breach of a pre-election promise, as Albanese had repeatedly stated he would not alter the tax cuts if elected. Despite this, the changes proved popular with the public, and the overhauled tax cuts were passed by the Senate on 27 February 2024.

==== Immigration and asylum ====
On 25 May 2022, in one of its first acts upon coming to government, the Albanese government allowed the Murugappan family to stay in Australia after the previous Morrison government had attempted to deport them. In February 2023, the Albanese government abolished temporary protection visas, allowing up to 19,000 asylum seekers to stay in Australia permanently. On 8 November 2023, the High Court of Australia ruled on &quot;NZYQ v Minister for Immigration&quot;, striking down the precedent established by &quot;Al-Kateb v Godwin&quot; and holding that indefinite detention of immigrants was illegal, leading to the immediate release of 148 people, some of whom had committed serious crimes. In response, the government enacted emergency legislation to put those released under strict visa conditions â including mandating the use of ankle monitoring and a mandatory curfew â and establish a preventive detention scheme to re-detain people who were found to pose a high risk to the community. However, in November 2024, the High Court would also find these laws unconstitutional, striking them down on the grounds they were too punitive. To circumvent this ruling, Albanese&#x27;s government unveiled legislation that gave the federal government comprehensive powers to deport non-citizens. Despite vociferous criticism from human rights and refugee advocacy groups, the necessary bills passed on 29 November 2024.

In 2023â24, the number of migrant arrivals decreased to 667,000, down from 739,000 a year earlier. Net overseas migration was 536,000 in 2022â23, up from 170,900 in 2021â22. On 11 December 2023, the Albanese government announced its ten-year migration strategy designed to overhaul the immigration system and reduce Australia&#x27;s annual net migration intake to 250,000 by June 2025. His government also announced it would introduce caps on the annual intake of international students, but attempts to pass these into law were blocked by the opposition and the Greens in Parliament.

==== Environment and climate change ====
On 16 June 2022, Albanese submitted a new Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations which formally committed Australia to reducing carbon emissions by 43% on 2005 levels. This represented an increase from the 26 to 28% target under the previous government. In September 2022, the Albanese government passed legislation to write this climate target into law. Albanese&#x27;s government also entered a bid for Australia and its Pacific island neighbours to host the 2024 United Nations Climate Change conference. Albanese supported a major expansion of gas production. In December 2024, he approved the expansion of four coal mines. He declared that he would not lift the moratorium on nuclear power in Australia.

In late-2022, his government announced reforms to the &quot;safeguard mechanism&quot;, an emissions trading scheme that requires Australia&#x27;s largest carbon emitters to keep their emissions under a &quot;baseline limit&quot;, either by reducing them, or by purchasing carbon credits. The mechanism was introduced by the Turnbull government in 2016, but failed to reduce emissions as the rules were often left unenforced. In March 2023, the Albanese government received the necessary support to pass the legislation from the Greens, who negotiated a &quot;hard cap&quot; on emissions that cannot be offset by carbon credits. The bill was passed on 30 March 2023, marking the most significant piece of climate change legislation passed through the Australian parliament since the &quot;Clean Energy Act 2011&quot;.

In December 2023, the government legislated a &quot;nature repair market&quot; to create a biodiversity market to encourage private companies to invest in projects that protect biodiversity, and has committed to establishing a federal environmental protection agency.

In May 2024, the government legislated a vehicle emission standard for new vehicles sold in Australia from 1 July 2025.

==== &#x27;Future Made in Australia&#x27; manufacturing policy ====
In April 2024, Albanese announced a major industrial policy called &#x27;Future Made in Australia&#x27;, which seeks to promote Australian manufacturing in sustainable energy.

As part of the policy, the government&#x27;s third budget contained $22.7 billion over a decade in support of domestic green hydroden, solar-panel manufacturing, and mining of critical minerals. This includes a $1 billion &#x27;Solar Sunshot&#x27; program to support solar panel manufacturing in Australia, and a $566 million &#x27;Resourcing Australia&#x27;s Prosperity&#x27; initiative for geomapping for mining resources.

In July 2024, his government introduced legislation to give further effect to the policy, which passed the Parliament in November 2024.

==== Government integrity and national anti-corruption commission ====
In November 2022, Albanese&#x27;s government fulfilled its election commitment to legislate the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), with the commission commencing on 1 July 2023.

Following the revelation that former prime minister Scott Morrison had secretly sworn himself into several ministerial positions, Albanese and his government successfully moved a censure motion against him in November 2022.

==== Industrial relations and employment ====
In one of his first acts as prime minister on 27 May 2022, Albanese confirmed that his government would make a submission to the Fair Work Commission in support of an increase to the national minimum wage. On 2 June 2023, the Albanese government contributed to a decision by the Fair Work Commission with another letter encouraging a rise in the minimum wage in line with inflation. The government announced that a submission had been formally made to the commission on 3 June 2022 and that a &quot;deliberate&quot; policy of lower wages was not the policy of the new government. The Fair Work Commission subsequently announced on 15 June 2022 that the minimum wage would be raised by 5.2%.

The government passed new workplace harassment laws through the Parliament on 28 November 2022. The new laws are in line with Albanese&#x27;s promise to implement the recommendations of the Respect@Work Report by creating a positive duty requiring employers to implement measures to prevent sexual harassment.

On 2 December 2022, the government passed its &quot;Secure Jobs, Better Pay&quot; law through the Parliament. The new law allows unions to negotiate multi-employer pay deals in an effort to secure wage increases across particular sectors such as child care and aged care. The law also aims to close the gender pay gap by prohibiting pay secrecy employment clauses and secures the right of workers to seek flexible working arrangements.

Throughout 2023, the Albanese government attempted to pass additional industrial relations reforms through Parliament, dubbed the &quot;Closing Loopholes&quot; bill, which aimed to ensure temporary workers employed through labour hire were paid the same wage as regular workers, criminalise wage theft and make companies responsible for industrial manslaughter, among other changes. Despite fierce opposition from the Liberal Party and business lobbies, the first part of the bill was passed by the Senate on 7 December 2023. The second tranche of legislation, which introduced minimum standards for gig workers and allowed workers the right to disconnect, was passed on 8 February 2024.

==== Housing ====
Albanese took office amid a major housing affordability crisis, with the average Australian house price being nine times the average household income by 2024. To remedy supply-side issues that contribute to rising prices, in August 2023, Albanese reached an agreement with National Cabinet to build 1.2 million houses over five years. On 13 September 2023, the government passed the Housing Australia Future Fund, a $10 billion investment fund controlled by the Future Fund that is designed to build 30,000 new social and affordable homes over the following five years in a further effort to increase supply. On 25 September 2024, his government instructed the Treasury to examine negative gearing. As a divisive wedge issue in Australian politics, changes to negative gearing rules were proposed by Labor prior to the 2019 election, in which they were defeated. Albanese had previously pledged not to modify negative gearing as Opposition Leader, leading to criticism from the Coalition and conservative media outlets for appearing to backtrack on this promise. After intense media speculation, Albanese ruled out making changes to negative gearing the next day. In November 2024, the Albanese government legislated a &quot;help-to-buy&quot; shared equity scheme that aims to allow up to 40,000 first-time home buyers to purchase a home with a shared contribution with the government, and a tax concession to incentivise developers to build houses specifically for the purpose of renting.

==== Indigenous affairs ====
In his victory speech on election night, Albanese expressed his support for the &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot;, and stated that his government would implement it in full within its first term. He pledged to hold a referendum to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament to assist the government with Indigenous issues, and recognise Indigenous Australians in Australia&#x27;s constitution.

The referendum was held on 14 October 2023 and the change to the Constitution was rejected by the majority of Australian voters and passed in no state or territory, bar the Australian Capital Territory.

At Albanese&#x27;s first press conference as Prime Minister, the podium flags in the blue room at Parliament were changed to include Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander flags in addition to the Australian flag. Upon the opening of the new Parliament, both flags began to be displayed in the House of Representatives and Senate chambers.

====Other====
In June 2024, Albanese pledged to introduce legislation that would force social media companies to ensure users under 16 years old could not create accounts, in an effort to curb the negative effects of social media on children. This plan was criticised by industry groups and major social media companies such as Meta (parent company of Facebook). The &quot;Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024&quot; was passed by Parliament on 28 November 2024, making Australia the first country in the world to legislate a minimum age for social media use. The ban is due to commence by the end of 2025.

=== International affairs ===
Albanese took his first international trip on 23 May 2022 immediately after being sworn in as prime minister when he flew to Tokyo to attend a Quadrilateral Security Dialogue meeting with fellow world leaders: US president Joe Biden, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. At the meeting, Albanese committed his new government to the goals of the Quad and confirmed that his government would seek to take stronger action in reducing carbon emissions. On 5 June, Albanese and Penny Wong visited Indonesian president Joko Widodo in Jakarta to develop AustraliaâIndonesia relations. Albanese said he would not &quot;publicly intervene&quot; to prevent WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from being extradited to the United States. Instead, he and his government engaged in what was dubbed &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; with the United States, including raising the issue directly with president Biden. Assange was released from custody after striking a plea deal in June 2024. Barrister Greg Barns, who acted as a legal advisor to Assange, credited Albanese&#x27;s government as &quot;instrumental&quot; to Assange&#x27;s release.
Later in June, Albanese attended the 2022 NATO Madrid summit to discuss security threats facing the Pacific region. On 30 June, Albanese met with French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris to &quot;reset&quot; AustraliaâFrance relations, which had been damaged following the cancellation of a submarine deal by the preceding government. The next day, Albanese travelled to Ukraine to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, making him the first Australian prime minister to make a diplomatic visit to Ukraine. Albanese pledged a further $100 million in aid to assist with the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.

On 26 September 2022, Albanese travelled to Japan to attend the state funeral of former prime minister Shinzo Abe.
The relationship between Australia and China started to improve since Albanese became prime minister. In November 2022, Albanese held a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, bringing an end to the longest diplomatic freeze in 50 years between Australia and China. In early 2023, China ended its unofficial ban on imports of Australian coal, with all restrictions reportedly being lifted by 14 March. China agreed to lift its ban on barley imports from Australia in April, and imports of Australian timber in May, further improving the relations.

In February 2023, Albanese hosted his New Zealand counterpart Chris Hipkins, who undertook his first official visit. While the two leaders reaffirmed Australian-New Zealand bilateral relations, they also discussed the controversial Section 501 deportation policy. Albanese confirmed that his government would amend the deportation policy to take into account individuals&#x27; connections to Australia and the length of time they had lived in the country.

In March 2023, Albanese visited India to attend the Australia-India Annual Leaders&#x27; Summit in New Delhi. During the visit, he also led a trade delegation, which included Trade Minister Don Farrell and Resources Minister Madeleine King, after the implementation of the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) between Australia and India on 29 December 2022. He also attended the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event hosted by PM Modi at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad to celebrate 75 years of strong diplomatic and cricketing ties between the two nations. The PMs attended a match of the BorderâGavaskar Trophy where Albanese handed over Australian Cricket Captain Steve Smith his test cap.
On 13 March 2023, Albanese travelled to San Diego to officially commence the AUKUS security pact with President Biden and United Kingdom prime minister Rishi Sunak. Through the deal, which was signed by Albanese&#x27;s predecessor, Australia will procure $368 billion worth of defence materiel, including nuclear-powered submarines in an effort to counter China&#x27;s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. The deal has been negatively received by China and former prime minister Paul Keating, who called it the &quot;worst deal in all history&quot;.
AustraliaâPhilippines relations upgraded to a strategic partnership when Albanese visited Manila on 8 September 2023, the first bilateral visit to the Philippines by an Australian prime minister in two decades. He and President Bongbong Marcos agreed for their defence ministers to meet annually due to &quot;rising security challenges&quot; in the Indo-Pacific.

Between 4 and 7 November, Albanese visited Shanghai and Beijing, becoming the first Australian prime minister to visit China in seven years. The trip, described as an effort to get relations between Australia and China on track, coincided with the 50th anniversary of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam&#x27;s visit to China, the first by an Australian prime minister. During the trip, Albanese gave a speech at the China International Import Expo, and met with Premier Li Qiang and President Xi Jinping. The following week, he signed the Falepili Union treaty with the Pacific island country of Tuvalu. Described as &quot;groundbreaking&quot; by legal scholar Jane McAdam, the treaty entrenches bilateral relations between the two countries, with Australia agreeing to provide funds to help the country deal with the effects of climate change and also resettle 280 Tuvaluans a year, as the country is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

In April 2024, Albanese told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Australians were outraged by the death of an Australian citizen in Israel&#x27;s attack on aid workers in Gaza. Albanese condemned the Iranian strikes in Israel and reiterated the necessity for sanctions against Iran.

In August 2024, Albanese and Indonesian President-elect and Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto announced a new defense cooperation agreement to strengthen AustraliaâIndonesia security ties.

===Appointments===
====Public service====
On 3 April 2024, Albanese announced Sam Mostyn as the new governor-general of Australia, replacing the outgoing David Hurley. She began her term on 1 July 2024. On 25 July 2024, Albanese announced jointly with the energy minister Bowen that former New South Wales energy minister Matt Kean would become the new Chair of the Climate Change Authority. In July 2024, Albanese appointed Jillian Segal as Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism in a response to an increase in anti-semitic rhetoric and violence since the beginning of the IsraelâHamas war. He similarly appointed Muslim faith leader Aftab Malik as Special Envoy to Combat Islamophobia in October 2024.

====Judiciary====
On 17 October 2022, Albanese&#x27;s government appointed Jayne Jagot as a Justice of the High Court of Australia, giving the High Court a majority of female Justices for the first time in its history. On 22 August 2023, his government appointed Stephen Gageler as chief justice of Australia.

== Political views ==
Albanese has described his political views as progressive, and is aligned with the Labor Left faction. Several journalists and analysts have noted his ideological shift to centrism during the 2022 election campaign and upon becoming prime minister.

Albanese is a republican, and supports replacing Australia&#x27;s current constitutional monarchy. In a debate to mark the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee, he told the Australian Parliament, &quot;Even many Australians who do not hold with the principle of monarchy feel regard for her. You can be a republican, as I am, and still have the deepest respect for the Queen. She has done her duty with fidelity, integrity, humanity and, as she sometimes lets slip, a sly sense of humour.&quot; He has stated his desire to give constitutional recognition to Indigenous Australians, and pledged to hold a referendum regarding an Indigenous Voice to Parliament upon becoming prime minister. He has stated that this recognition should come before any referendum regarding Australia&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarchy vs. a republic.

=== Environmental issues ===
While serving in the Gillard government, Albanese supported the introduction of carbon pricing, and voted, along with the rest of the Labor Party, to establish the &quot;Clean Energy Act 2011&quot;, which instituted a carbon pricing scheme in Australia. After the Abbott government abolished the scheme in July 2014, Albanese stated that carbon pricing was no longer needed, as &quot;the circumstances have changed&quot;.

Albanese is a prominent backer of renewable energy in Australia and has declared that the country&#x27;s &quot;long-term future lies in renewable energy sources&quot;. Upon his election in 2022, he said he would &quot;end the climate wars&quot; and mitigation and policies to address climate change in Australia would be a priority for his government, in contrast with those preceding it.

=== Foreign policy ===
Albanese&#x27;s foreign policy beliefs have been the subject of media attention. Writing for the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;, James Curran noted his shift from an &quot;idealistic left-wing critic of globalisation&quot; to &quot;a true believer in the American alliance&quot;. Albanese was staunchly opposed to the US-led invasion of Iraq, saying in February 2003 that &quot;Whatever criticisms can be made of the Iraqi regime, Islamic fundamentalism is not one of them. This is one of the reasons the United States supported Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, including supplying his regime with weapons of mass destruction, which he then used against both the Iranians and the Kurds.&quot; Albanese has repeatedly urged for the release of Australian whistleblower and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who was being held in custody in the United Kingdom until 2024.

Albanese&#x27;s views on the IsraeliâPalestinian conflict have also been the subject of media interest, with &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; categorising him as a supporter of Palestine. Alongside Joe Hockey, Albanese established the parliamentary &quot;Friends of Palestine&quot; group in 1998. Despite this, he has been a critic of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, calling it &quot;clumsy and counterproductive&quot;. During the 2014 Gaza War, he called Israel&#x27;s bombardment of the Gaza Strip a &quot;collective punishment&quot; that was &quot;completely unacceptable&quot;. In 2018, he challenged a decision by the Australian government to vote against a UN human rights council motion calling for an investigation into the killings of Palestinian protesters during the Great March of Return. Shortly before the 2022 election, Albanese told &quot;The Australian Jewish News&quot; that any decision he takes on Israel-Palestine will contribute &quot;to a peaceful resolution of the conflict and to progress towards a two-state solution&quot;. When asked about a 2018 resolution to recognise the State of Palestine, Albanese insisted the motion &quot;has no greater or lesser weight&quot; than it did previously. In October 2022, his government reversed the Morrison government&#x27;s decision to recognise West Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. In December 2023, Albanese signed a joint statement, along with the prime ministers of Canada and New Zealand, calling for a ceasefire in the 2023 IsraelâHamas war.

In February 2022, Albanese condemned Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, remarking in a press release that it was a &quot;grave moment for humanity&quot;.

In May 2022, Albanese said Australia&#x27;s relationship with China would remain &quot;a difficult one&quot;. He said that &quot;Australia values human rights. We have spoken out about the treatment of Uyghurs, about what&#x27;s occurred in Hong Kong, about Taiwan, about other minorities including in Tibet, that are suffering from human rights abuses.&quot;

=== Social issues ===

Albanese supports abortion rights, stating in an interview in August 2019 that he believes &quot;women do have a right to choose&quot;. He is also in favour of legalising voluntary euthanasia; in December 2022, his government repealed the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;, which prevented the territories of Australia from legalising euthanasia.

Albanese is a supporter and advocate for LGBT rights, and has regularly participated in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras since 1983. When Labor Party members were granted a conscience vote on the &quot;Marriage Amendment Bill 2012&quot;, which would have legalised same-sex marriage in Australia, Albanese voted in favour of the bill, which was unsuccessful. He opposed holding a plebiscite for same-sex marriage, stating that &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t be having a public vote where we get to judge other families&quot;. In 2017, Albanese also voted in favour of the &quot;Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017&quot;, the bill which ultimately legalised same-sex marriage. Albanese has voiced support of transgender rights, saying that &quot;people coming to terms with their identity and who they are, I think that they need to be respected&quot;, although has voted against transgender rights in the past.

Early in his political career, Albanese supported drug decriminalisation, telling Parliament in 1997 that &quot;drug use by individuals is a health issue, not a criminal issue&quot;. However, in February 2022, he declined to commit to decriminalisation of hard drugs, commenting that the &quot;current settings are appropriate&quot;.

In July 2015, Albanese stated his opposition to the government&#x27;s policy of turning back asylum seekers who arrive to the country via boat, saying: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t ask someone else to do something that I couldn&#x27;t see myself doing ... if people were in a boat including families and children, I myself couldn&#x27;t turn that around.&quot; During the 2022 federal election campaign, Albanese clarified that boat turnbacks would be incorporated into his government&#x27;s policy, leading to some critics accusing him of &quot;flip-flopping&quot; on the issue. In August 2021, after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, Albanese urged the Morrison government to give Afghan refugees permanent residency in Australia.

In May 2024, Albanese voiced his support for raising the age at which a child can open a social media account from 13 to 16, citing concerns over the mental health of young people.

== Personal life ==
In 2000, Albanese married Carmel Tebbutt, a future Deputy Premier of New South Wales. They had met in Young Labor during the late 1980s, and have one son together. The two separated in January 2019. In June 2020, it was reported that Albanese was in a relationship with Jodie Haydon. Albanese said they had met at a dinner event in Melbourne a year after his separation from Tebbutt. Albanese is the first divorcee to be appointed prime minister. In February 2024, Albanese announced his engagement to Haydon after proposing to her at The Lodge in Canberra, making him the first prime minister of Australia to be engaged while in office. Their wedding will be held after the 2025 Australian federal election.

Albanese describes himself as &quot;half-Italian and half-Irish&quot; and a &quot;non-practising Catholic&quot;. He is also a music fan who, not long after becoming prime minister, attended a Gang of Youths concert at the Enmore Theatre and previously intervened as transport minister to save a Dolly Parton tour from bureaucratic red tape. In 2013, he co-hosted a pre-election special of music program &quot;Rage&quot; and his song selection included the Pixies, the Pogues, the Smiths, the Triffids, PJ Harvey, Nirvana, Hunters &amp; Collectors and Joy Division. On 30 November 2023, Albanese posted his Spotify Wrapped to his Instagram story, indicating his top artists to be Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift, Hilltop Hoods, Bruce Springsteen, and Lily Allen.

As a lifelong supporter of the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club, Albanese was a board member of the club from 1999 to 2002 and influential in the fight to have the club readmitted to the National Rugby League (NRL) competition. During October 2009, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Albanese had opposed an attempt to appoint the former Liberal prime minister John Howard to a senior position in the NRL. Albanese stated he had phoned the NRL chief executive, David Gallop, as well as other league officials, to advise them against the idea. He then implored officials at Souths to help stop the suggestion from gaining momentum. In 2013, he was made a life member of the club. He is also a fan of Australian rules football, and supports the Hawthorn Football Club, with Albanese attending the 1991 AFL Grand Final which saw Hawthorn claim its 9th premiership.

Albanese was injured in a side collision while driving in Marrickville, New South Wales, on 8 January 2021. He underwent treatment at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and was reportedly &quot;injured externally and internally and had suffered considerable shock in the immediate aftermath of the impact&quot;. The other driver was a 17-year-old who received a ticket for negligent driving. Emergency workers told Albanese that if the teen&#x27;s car had hit just 30 centimetres either side of where it did, Albanese &quot;would almost certainly have been killed&quot;. Shortly following this accident, Albanese lost over 18 kilograms (39 pounds) by cutting out carbohydrates and reducing his alcohol intake, in an effort to be &quot;match fit&quot; for his election campaign.

<text>Peter James Andren AM (28 August 1946 â 3 November 2007) was an Australian politician. He was an independent member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1996 until October 2007, representing the electorate of Calare, New South Wales.

==Biography==
Peter Andren was born in Gulargambone, New South Wales, and attended Normanhurst Boys High School and Macquarie University, Sydney. He was a teacher, television reporter, presenter and producer and radio and television news editor with Prime Television and 2GZ before entering politics.
In the 1996 election, he stood for election in Calare. He was not only displeased with the quality of candidates in the field to succeed longtime Labor incumbent David Simmons, but felt that rural Australia was losing its voice in Canberra. It was initially thought that Simmons&#x27; retirement gave the Nationals a chance to take the seat. However, owing partly to his name recognition (Prime&#x27;s service area covered most of the electorate), Andren won the seat after Labor&#x27;s preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him, taking 63 percent of the two-candidate vote. He held the seat without serious difficulty in the next three elections; his two candidate-preferred vote of over 75 per cent in 2001 made Calare the second-safest seat in Australia.

He attempted to implement changes to politicians&#x27; superannuation, involving giving members the opportunity to opt out of the parliamentary scheme. He introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to this extent, which failed to pass through either house. He had been an active opponent of genetically modified crops, and was involved with the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. Andren was known to join with the other two rural independent members, Bob Katter and Tony Windsor, in raising regional issues with the Parliament and media. He was also a vocal critic of Australia&#x27;s policy on asylum seekers, and the Iraq War.

A redistribution of electoral boundaries in 2006 effectively cut Calare in half and reduced Andren&#x27;s notional majority, leading to speculation that he might have stood for the neighbouring seat of Macquarie, which now included former Calare cities Bathurst and Lithgow, at the next election. On 29 March 2007, he instead made an announcement that he would stand down from Calare to contest a New South Wales seat in the Senateâa race that it was widely believed he would win.

However he subsequently announced on 10 August 2007 that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and that &quot;the diagnosis and available interventions to treat this cancer are not very encouraging.&quot; Due to his illness, he had to abandon his candidacy for a seat in the Senate and he saw out his term as member for Calare until the parliament was dissolved on 17 October, before the 2007 election. He died less than three weeks later, on 3 November, survived by his partner Valerie Faber, his two sons Greg and Josh and his ex-wife Jenny Price. His funeral at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Orange was attended by an estimated 600â1000 people.

Andren&#x27;s seat of Calare was won by John Cobb for the National Party at the 2007 election.

On 9 June 2008 Andren&#x27;s appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia was posthumously announced. The award cited his services in Parliament and to rural and regional Australia.

After his death, the Orange Aboriginal Medical Service set up a $5,000 medical scholarship named in Andren&#x27;s honour.

<text>Martin Cullen (born 2 November 1954) is an Irish former Fianna FÃ¡il politician who served as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism from 2008 to 2010, Minister for Social and Family Affairs from 2007 to 2008, Minister for Transport from 2004 to 2007, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from 2002 to 2004 and Minister of State at the Department of Finance from 1997 to 2002. He served as a Teachta DÃ¡la (TD) for the Waterford constituency from 1987 to 1989 and from 1992 to 2010. He was a Senator from 1989 to 1992, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

==Background, early and private life==
Martin Cullen was born in Waterford in 1954. He was educated at Waterpark College and the Regional Technical College, Waterford. He is married and has four children â three sons and one daughter. However, in late 2004 he stated that he was separated from his wife, Dorthe.

Cullen&#x27;s father and grandfather had been Mayor of Waterford, a position Martin Cullen himself later occupied in 1993â1994.

Cullen worked as a sales manager for a wine company before becoming interested in politics. He was also Chief Executive of the Irish Transport Operators.

==Political career==
Cullen was one of 14 Progressive Democrats TDs elected to DÃ¡il Ãireann at the 1987 general election, the first election after the party was founded. During his first period as a TD he served as his party&#x27;s spokesperson on Tourism, Transport and Communications (1987â1988) and Industry and Commerce (1988â1989). Cullen lost his seat at the 1989 general election but was subsequently nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad Ãireann. During the intervening period he was elected to Waterford City Council, before returning to the DÃ¡il at the 1992 general election.

In the following year Cullen was appointed party spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment. He became disillusioned with the party, and joined Fianna FÃ¡il in September 1994.

===Ahern Government===
In 1997, Cullen was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance by the Fianna FÃ¡ilâProgressive Democrats coalition government that came to office after the general election. He was given responsibility for the Office of Public Works where he made huge progress in restoring the reputation of that department with number of high-profile projects, such as Leinster House 2000 and the purchase of the Farmleigh estate from Edward Guinness.

After the Government&#x27;s re-election in 2002, Cullen joined the Cabinet as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. As Minister responsible for elections, he inherited a previous government decision to move to an electronic-based system which was successfully tested by the previous government. However a media-led campaign which became highly politicized, derailed public confidence in the new system coupled with a desire to retain the old paper system. The electronic system was ultimately scrapped by government years later. He took a strong interest in Environmental Policies and introduced the highly successful &quot;Race Against Waste Campaign&quot; which had a huge impact on how domestic waste was separated and collected. Ireland assumed the European Presidency during his tenure, and he became President of the European Environmental Council and played a significant role at the world Earth Summits.

In a cabinet reshuffle in 2004 Cullen was appointed Minister for Transport. During that appointment he became embroiled in even more controversy. Two independent reports have cleared him of any wrongdoing in the awarding of lucrative Public Relations contracts to Monica Leech, who subsequently became President of Waterford Chambers of Commerce.

With the support of a majority of DÃ¡il Ãireann, he was the minister responsible for the stock market flotation of Aer Lingus, Ireland&#x27;s national airline. According to the government this was done as the EU would not easily permit direct government investment in the airline. The sale included Aer Lingus&#x27; access slots to various airports including London Heathrow Airport. Some critics at the time suggested that it was important that Ireland, as an island nation, retain control of an airline in order to ensure connectivity to nearby countries. In May 2005, Minister Cullen told DÃ¡il Ãireann that &quot;in the context of any decision to reduce State ownership in Aer Lingus, all the options available within the regulatory framework will be examined to ensure adequate ongoing access to Heathrow for Irish consumers&quot;. Others, including members of Seanad Ãireann and DÃ¡il Ãireann raised the issue of the Heathrow slots.

Shortly after the privatisation, Irish-based private airline Ryanair attempted a takeover of Aer Lingus which was eventually blocked by other shareholders including the government (who retained a 28.3% share), Aer Lingus employee groups and Irish businessman Denis O&#x27;Brien. Cullen maintained throughout that the sale of Aer Lingus was &quot;the right decision&quot;.

In August 2007, Aer Lingus announced that it would cease flying from Shannon Airport to London Heathrow Airport, instead using its Heathrow slots to fly from Belfast International Airport in Northern Ireland. This decision caused considerable controversy in the Republic of Ireland. principally due to the loss of connectivity from businesses in the West of Ireland to a major international hub. Local representatives in the Shannon area have claimed that Minister Cullen ignored calls to ring-fence slots for Shannon airport. The airport access slots are held by Aer Lingus for historical reasons, as the national carrier for the Republic of Ireland. This was the first time since the privatisation of Aer Lingus that traditional Irish slots were transferred outside the state. Aer Lingus has admitted that it has further slots to lease at Heathrow. It has also been revealed that it intended removing flights from Cork Airport.

===30th DÃ¡il===
Following the 2007 general election, he was appointed as Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

On 7 May 2008, when Brian Cowen became Taoiseach, Cullen was appointed as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. He commented a week later, &quot;My private life has all been about the arts. There&#x27;s probably not an opera theatre in the world that I haven&#x27;t been in, all in my own private time, I hasten to add&quot;.

In December 2008 he courted controversy by commenting on national radio that he would be supportive of having an Irish football club taking part in England&#x27;s Premier League, despite the damage such a development would have on domestic football in Ireland, and the comments were also seen as unsuitable for the Minister for Arts, Sports, and Tourism. His comments that he would like to &quot;see a European [football] team playing out of Dublin&quot; suggested he was not aware of, or interested in, the six Dublin-based teams currently playing in domestic football.

In March 2009, a helicopter which was carrying him from Killarney to Dublin made an emergency landing shortly after take-off, because a door had fallen off. The minister was uninjured, but was reported to be &quot;shaken&quot;. It was reported that the flight had cost nearly â¬6,000. Cullen dismissed criticism of his use of the Air Corps helicopter, and said there had been no unnecessary spending on his travel.

On 21 January 2010, he published his speech to the forum on Defamation Law, in which he spoke of his experiences of false allegations of adultery in the press. He felt it had been &quot;like waking up every morning and being raped&quot;, that he had been photographed on the front pages of Sunday newspapers for 13 consecutive weeks and that his sons had &quot;had the living daylights&quot; beaten out of them for defending their father&#x27;s honour and had to be removed from school due to &quot;horrendous bullying&quot;. Cullen described how he had been pursued by the media, with reporters harassing him, photographers following him, even once a photograph of him, the Taoiseach and his secretary, and a third man at a state function was altered to make it appear he was dining alone with the woman. &quot;The impacts on one&#x27;s life are completely horrendous. I would go so far as to say in my case they are life-changing,&quot; he said. He later defended his use of the word &quot;rape&quot;.

Cullen announced his resignation from his ministerial office and as a TD on 8 March 2010, due to a back ailment that had been troubling him severely in the preceding months. He stepped down from cabinet on 23 March 2010 when Brian Cowen announced a cabinet reshuffle and resigned as a TD the following day.

<text>John Neil Andrew (born 7 June 1944) is a former Australian politician. He served in the House of Representatives for over 20 years from 1983 to 2004 representing the Division of Wakefield in South Australia for the Liberal Party. He became the 24th Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1998, a position he held until 2004.

==Early life==
Andrew was born in Waikerie, South Australia, and was a horticulturalist before entering politics. He was a councillor in the District Council of Waikerie from 1976 to 1983.

==Politics==
Andrew was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1983 federal election. Having served as Deputy Chairman of Committees, and Government Chief Whip, he became Speaker of the House after the October 1998 elections. He presided over the House during the special sitting in May 2001 to mark the centenary of the Parliament of Australia, which met in the Victorian Legislative Assembly after meeting in the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, as did the first Parliament in 1901. In 2003, he &quot;named&quot; Greens Senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle after they interjected during George W. Bush&#x27;s speech to Parliament.

In the international sphere, Andrew did much to raise Australia&#x27;s reputation as being a country which punched well above its weight, and could be relied upon to keep its word, once given. He participated in bilateral meetings wherever possible. For example, he held bilateral meetings with the Finno-Ugric group at Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) meetings in Chile in 2003 to explain Australia&#x27;s participation in the intervention in the Middle East.

One of Neil Andrew&#x27;s most significant parliamentary contributions was made in the advancement of parliamentary administration and reform, as was acknowledged in the citation for his recognition in the Order of Australia. Together with the then President of the Senate, he authorised the review into parliamentary administration by the Parliamentary and Public Service Commissioner Andrew Podger. Subsequently, Andrew sponsored measures to reform the Parliament&#x27;s administration, conducting sensitive private and public briefings, and providing moral support in the maneuvering of reform proposals through the Australian Senate. His efforts resulted in the success of reforms which had been advocated on at least a dozen occasions, without success over the previous 90 years, starting with Prime Minister Fisher in 1910.

Andrew previously represented a large swath of rural territory north of Adelaide. However, a redistribution ahead of the 2004 elections pushed his seat well to the south to take in heavily pro-Labor northern Adelaide suburbs that had previously been in the safe Labor seat of Bonython. Meanwhile, most of his former rural territory was redistributed to neighbouring Grey and Barker. Andrew held his old seat with a comfortably safe majority of 14 percent, but the reconfigured Wakefield had a Labor majority of just over one percent. Prior to the new boundaries being announced, Andrew notified Prime Minister John Howard that he would not renominate for Wakefield in the upcoming election. He remained Speaker until David Hawker was elected to succeed him on 16 November.

==Honours==
Andrew was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2008 Australia Day Honours list &quot;for service to the Parliament of Australia through the advancement of parliamentary administration and reform, and to the community in the areas of agricultural research, development and education&quot; particularly as Chair of the Crawford Fund in Australia.

He was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE) in 2006.

<doc id="556754" wikidata="Q1184885" url="?curid=556754" title="Richmond, New South Wales">
<text>Richmond is a historic town northwest of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Richmond is in the local government area of the City of Hawkesbury and is part of the Sydney metropolitan area. It is located 19 metres above sea level on the alluvial Hawkesbury River flats, at the foot of the Blue Mountains. It is about 62Â km by road from Sydney, 22Â km from Penrith, 25Â km from Blacktown, 39Â km from Parramatta, 78Â km from Lithgow and 7Â km from Windsor. Richmond is now part of the Sydney urban area, with access to various amenities.

==History==
The Darug people were the Aboriginal peoples in the area in 1788.

The area was originally explored by British settlers in 1789 and the nearby eminence to the west of the Hawkesbury River was known by them as &#x27;Richmond Hill&#x27;. The name was given by Governor Arthur Phillip, in honour of Charles Lennox, the third Duke of Richmond who was Master General of Ordnance in the Pitt administration. Richmond was the fifth oldest area to have European settlement in Australia after Sydney, Parramatta, Kingston and Windsor. The first 22 European settlers came to the area in 1794 and established town. They came to farm a total of in what is now Pitt Town Bottoms. They needed good farming land to help overcome the desperate need for food in the new colony. By 1799 this region was producing about half the grain produced in the colony.

The &quot;Battle of Richmond Hill&quot; took place in May and June 1795 between the Darug people and British Marines.

Around 1811 Macquarie officially established the five &quot;Macquarie Towns&quot; in the area: Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh, Wilberforce and Pitt Town. One of the early settlers, James Blackman, built Bowman Cottage from brick nog, a common construction technique in the colony, using money borrowed from William Cox. The house was constructed between the years 1815 and 1818. James was unable to pay his debts and was forced to sell the property to George Bowman. The building was restored by the NSW Public Works Department and then became a Division of the Australian Foundation for the Disabled, providing employment for the disabled.

During WWII the RAAF operated a top secret operations bunker from somewhere in Richmond. It was either half or completely underground. The location of this bunker is unknown but it has been reported that this bunker was identical to the Bankstown Bunker which is currently buried under a public park in Bankstown. It has also been reported that this bunker could still be intact.

RAAF Base Richmond is a Royal Australian Air Force base at Richmond which was established in 1923. The air base is currently the home to the RAAF&#x27;s transport squadrons. During the Vietnam War, logistic support and medical evacuations were supplied by the C-130 Hercules aircraft from RAAF Richmond.

==Geography==

The expansion of the Sydney suburban area has almost reached Richmond and it is now considered to be an outer suburb of Sydney. Bells Line of Road which leads into, over and across the Blue Mountains, finishing in Lithgow, starts in Richmond. Richmond railway station is the terminus of the Richmond branch. Richmond is surrounded by the 329Â km2 Richmond Woodlands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of the importance of the patches of remnant eucalypt woodland it contains for endangered regent honeyeaters and swift parrots. Numerous times Richmond area has been flooded as its staying near to Hawkesbury River.

Richmond is surrounded by 1327 hectares land of Western Sydney University Hawkesbury campus, 270 hectares land of RAAF Base Richmond Airport and Richmond Lowlands near Hawkesbury River. So it is the one and only isolated town in Sydney without having high density housing and population.

==Transport==
Richmond is connected with road, rail, water (Hawkebury River) and air (RAAF Base Richmond) network. Major roads are Richmond Road to Blacktown, M7 and Sydney; Hawkesbury Valley Way to Windsor, A2, M2 and Sydney; Bells Line of Road to Kurrajong, Bilpin and Lithgow; Londonderry Road to Penrith and Castlereagh Road to Blue Mountains and Penrith. Richmond Railway Station which is a terminus, serves T1 and T5 Sydney Train Networks in Richmond railway line with a service every half an hour to Sydney Central or Leppington. RAAF Base Richmond is a Defence Airport whereas nearby public airports are Sydney Airport and Western Sydney Airport (under construction). Bus services are to Windsor, Penrith (via Londonderry and Agnes Banks), Kurrajong, Bligh Park, Grose Vale, Berambing and night bus service to Sydney (Town Hall Park St). Hawkesbury River is the main reason settlement happened in the Richmond area with boats and cruises. Still people are using river for recreational purposes.

==Climate==
Richmond has a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen: &quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. Due to its inland location, Richmond has hotter summer days than Sydney CBD, with temperatures sometimes reaching highs of . Richmond&#x27;s extreme summer temperatures are also credited to fÃ¶hn wind sweeping off the Central Tablelands down into the foothills of the suburb. Winter nights are colder than Sydney CBD&#x27;s and they can drop below with significant frost. Richmond has 91.5 days of clear skies annually, in contrast to Sydney CBD&#x27;s 104 days. On 14 January 1939, Richmond recorded a temperature of , the highest in the Sydney region until a 2020 reading of at Penrith. Its lowest maximum winter temperature was , recorded on 6 July 1957. 

After Mitchell, Queensland, Richmond has the second largest overall temperature range recorded in Australia; to , a range of 56.1 Â°C.

<doc id="556758" wikidata="Q6395733" url="?curid=556758" title="Kevin Andrews (politician)">
<text>Kevin James Andrews (9 November 1955 â 14 December 2024) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the Liberal Party and served as a cabinet minister in the Howard and Abbott governments. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2022, representing the Victorian seat of Menzies.

Andrews was raised in Sale, Victoria. He studied arts and law at the University of Melbourne and worked as a barrister prior to entering politics, specialising in health law and bioethics. He was elected to parliament at the 1991 Menzies by-election and became known for his social conservatism. He was responsible for the private member&#x27;s bill which became the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;, outlawing euthanasia in federal territories. Andrews became a senior figure in the Howard government, serving as Minister for Ageing (2001â2003), Employment and Workplace Relations (2003â2007), and Immigration and Citizenship (2007). He was appointed to cabinet in 2003 and as employment minister was responsible for the government&#x27;s controversial WorkChoices reforms to industrial relations.

After the Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 federal election, Andrews remained a senior figure in the Liberal Party&#x27;s conservative faction. He played a key role in the 2009 Liberal leadership spill which saw Tony Abbott replace Malcolm Turnbull as party leader. He returned to cabinet under Abbott after Coalition returned to power at the 2013 election, serving as Minister for Social Services (2013â2014) and Defence (2014â2015). He was removed from cabinet after the 2015 leadership spill which saw Turnbull return as leader and replace Abbott as prime minister. He remained in parliament as a backbencher until his retirement at the 2022 election, having earlier been defeated for Liberal preselection by Keith Wolahan.

==Early life and education==
Andrews was born on 9 November 1955 in Sale, Victoria, the son of Roy Gebhardt Andrews and Sheila Rosina O&#x27;Connor. He was educated at the Rosedale Primary School, St Patrick&#x27;s College, Sale, and the University of Melbourne, where he resided at Newman College and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1979 and a Bachelor of Arts in 1980. At university, he was president of the Newman College Students&#x27; Club and the National Association of Australian University Colleges. He later completed a Master of Laws degree at Monash University in 1986.

Andrews was a racing commentator in the 1970s and 80s, calling various sporting events including athletics, cycling and motor sports, and writing for a number of publications including Australian Auto Action. He was also secretary of the Melbourne University Athletics Club and a director of the Victorian Amateur Athletics Association. At Melbourne University, he trained with .

== Legal practice ==
After graduation, he worked for the Law Institute of Victoria from 1980 to 1983, as a research solicitor and co-ordinator of Continuing Legal Education. From 1983 to 1985, he served as associate to Sir James Gobbo, Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, and subsequently the Governor of Victoria. He practised as a barrister from 1985 until his election to Parliament in 1991.

While practising law Andrews specialised in health law and bioethics and was involved with the St Vincent&#x27;s Bioethics Centre, the Mercy Hospital for Women, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the Lincoln School of Health Sciences. He was also a board member of Caritas Christi Hospice. In 1986, he represented the grandfather of a newborn infant with spina bifida in a case in the Supreme Court of Victoria, following allegations the Queen Victoria Hospital had attempted to withhold care. Judge Frank Vincent subsequently granted an order making the infant a ward of the court and mandating the hospital continue to provide treatyment, which was &quot;believed to be the first time an Australian hospital has been forced to maintain the life of a person&quot;.

==Early political career==
Andrews was elected to the House of Representatives for the Liberal Party at the 1991 Menzies by-election in Victoria. Andrews has never lived in his electorate but in the neighbouring Jagajaga. He won Liberal preselection for Menzies against 25 other candidates.

Andrews was a member of the Lyons Forum, a socially conservative Christian group within the Coalition that was disbanded in the mid-1990s. Andrews served as the Forum Secretary and is credited with suggesting the name for the group.

Andrews was shadow minister for schools but was removed from the position when Alexander Downer replaced John Hewson as Liberal leader in May 1994.

==Howard government (1996â2007)==
As a backbencher, Andrews chaired the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He presented a private member&#x27;s bill, the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996&quot;, which was passed in 1997 and overrode the Northern Territory&#x27;s legislation, the &quot;Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995&quot;, that legalised euthanasia in the Territory.

Andrews called for an end to trials of the RU-486 drug, and voted against a bill in 2006 that took away the Health Minister&#x27;s power to veto applications to allow the drug to be used.

In taking a stance against stem cell research in 2002, he stated that it was the &quot;first time&quot; that &quot;human beings can be treated as a commodity&quot;. He also took a stance against stem cell research during a debate in 2006, which resulted in the overturning of a previous ban on the research.

After the Coalition&#x27;s third victory in 2001, Andrews was brought into the outer ministry as Minister for Ageing, a portfolio in which he served from 26 November 2001 to 7 October 2003. He was subsequently appointed to Cabinet as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and was responsible for introducing the Howard government&#x27;s major changes to industrial relations law in 2005, commonly known as WorkChoices, which introduced a national system of workplace relations in Australia. In a reshuffle in early 2007, Andrews was made Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, a position which he held until the swearing-in of the First Rudd Ministry on 3 December 2007, following the defeat of the Howard government in the 2007 election.

==Opposition (2007â2013)==
During 2008 and 2009, he served as Chairman of the Coalition&#x27;s Policy Review Committee, reviewing and developing the Opposition&#x27;s policies, until he was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet (to the position of Shadow Minister for Families, Housing and Human Services) in December 2009 by the newly elected Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott. He was also appointed Deputy Chairman of the Coalition Policy Development Committee.

In November 2009, Andrews declared his candidacy against Malcolm Turnbull in a vote for a leadership spill, in opposition to Turnbull&#x27;s support for the government&#x27;s emissions trading scheme. He had declared himself a climate change sceptic, saying that &quot;the jury is still out&quot; on human contributions to global warming. However, the partyroom voted down a leadership spill 41 votes to 35 and Andrews&#x27; challenge consequently did not eventuate. After continued leadership speculation, a second party room meeting was held, at which point the leadership was declared vacant. Tony Abbott, Joe Hockey, and Malcolm Turnbull all stood for the leadership, and Tony Abbott was ultimately successful. Following his election as Leader, Abbott promoted Andrews to the Shadow Cabinet as Minister for Families, Housing and Human Services.

At the 2010 federal election, Andrews was re-elected to the seat of Menzies with a 2.7-point swing against the Labor Party. He was subsequently re-elected in 2013, 2016 and 2019, becoming the &quot;Father of the Parliament&quot;.

Andrews chaired the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the Human Rights Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Joint Select Committee on Australia&#x27;s Family Law System, the Coalition Policy Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and the AustraliaâChina Parliamentary Friendship Group. He was also co-chair of the informal Parliamentary Friends of Hong Kong.

==Abbott government (2013â2015)==
In the Abbott government, Andrews served as Minister for Social Services from September 2013 to December 2014. He was then Minister for Defence from December 2014 to September 2015.

On 14 September 2015, after Deputy Leader Julie Bishop announced she would support Malcolm Turnbull in challenge against Prime Minister Tony Abbott for the leadership of the Liberal Party, Andrews announced he supported Abbott and would stand for the deputy leadership against Bishop. Bishop retained the position of Deputy Liberal Leader with 70 votes to Andrews&#x27; 30. Upon the appointment of the Turnbull government Andrews was dropped from the new Ministry and moved to the backbench.

==Final years in parliament==
With the retirement of Philip Ruddock at the 2016 federal election, Andrews became the Father of the House. Although Warren Snowdon was first elected in 1987, Andrews was the longest continuously serving member, because Snowdon was out of the House between 1996 and 1998. Andrews was one of three parliamentary survivors of the Hawke government, the others being Snowdon and Russell Broadbent. From 2019 until his retirement in 2022, Andrews was the &quot;Father of the Parliament&quot;, the currently longest, continuously serving member of the Australian Parliament.

On 31 January 2021, Andrews lost the Liberal Party&#x27;s endorsement in a preselection ballot to barrister Keith Wolahan (181 votes to 111). He retired at the 2022 election.

== Controversies ==
===Haneef affair===

As Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Andrews attracted controversy after he revoked on character grounds the visa of Dr Muhamed Haneef, who had been granted bail on charges of aiding terrorists. This was criticised as a move to keep Haneef in detention; upon posting bail, Haneef would have been transferred from Brisbane&#x27;s Wolston Correctional Centre to Sydney&#x27;s Villawood Detention Centre. Andrews defended his actions as being in accordance with the &quot;Migration Act&quot; and Haneef&#x27;s lawyers challenged his interpretation of the Act in the Federal Court.

Following the Director of Public Prosecutions dropping all charges against Haneef, Andrews refused calls to reinstate Haneef&#x27;s visa, stating that his personal evidence was still valid. Andrews&#x27; refusal resulted in calls for a public inquiry into the incident by then Queensland Premier Peter Beattie.

Andrews&#x27; justification of his decision, that he had a reasonable suspicion that Haneef had associated with suspected terrorists and therefore failed the test of good character that a person must pass to keep a visa, was rejected in the Federal Court, and the revocation of Haneef&#x27;s visa was overturned. However, in November, e-mails released under the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot; appeared to indicate that Andrews&#x27; office had a plan to revoke the visa before the case went to court, in the case that bail was granted.

On 23 December 2008, a government-ordered inquiry report was released. Mr. Clarke, the head of the judicial inquiry, determined Mr. Andrews did not act with an improper motive.

===Publications record===
Following Andrews&#x27; criticism of irregularities discovered in the CV of an Indian doctor working on the Gold Coast, various media organisations carried reports disputing Andrews&#x27; claim on parliamentary and ministerial websites to have co-authored three books, having contributed only a chapter to each. Andrews argued in his own defence that
:&quot;In common, everyday parlance, as one of the authors (of a chapter) I presumed you called yourself a co-author â that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve simply done. I wasn&#x27;t aware, to be frank, of some publishing convention that someone&#x27;s referred to (that suggests otherwise). If that offends people&#x27;s sensibilities well so be it, basically.&quot;

===2007 African immigration controversy===

During Andrews&#x27; tenure as immigration minister, he reacted to the murder of a young Sudanese-Australian man, Liep Gony, by stating &quot;Some groups of immigrants aren&#x27;t settling and adjusting into the Australian life as quickly as we would hope.&quot; When it emerged that Gony had been murdered by two White Australians, Andrews declined to apologise, stating &quot;Iâm not proposing to apologise for saying what people are concerned about.&quot;
In October 2007, Andrews&#x27; decision to cut Australia&#x27;s refugee intake from African nations was described by some critics as racist and a use of the race card to appeal to &quot;racist&quot; voters before the 2007 Australian federal election. 
The Queensland Labor Premier, Anna Bligh, described Andrews&#x27; criticism of Sudanese as &quot;disturbing&quot;. She said: &quot;It has been a long time since I have heard such a pure form of racism out of the mouth of any Australian politician.&quot; Labor politician Tony Burke described Andrews&#x27; decision as &quot;incompetent&quot;. However, Andrews&#x27; actions were applauded by then former One Nation politician, Pauline Hanson. In addition members of the Australian community viewed Andrews as responsible for creating a racial tension leading to anti-African sentiment in the community and racially based attacks on Sudanese migrants in Australia. Andrews stated in 2011 he did not regret raising the issue.

=== Use of parliamentary entitlements ===
In February 2016, Andrews used $1,855 in taxpayer funds as part of approved &quot;study allowance&quot; to attend the US National &quot;prayer breakfast&quot; in Washington DC, a bipartisan annual event which is addressed by the President of the United States, address the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, about Australia&#x27;s security policy, and have a series of policy discussion meetings in Washington DC and in the process missed the first week of Parliament, which had been approved by the party Whip.

=== Religious bakeries ===
In November 2017, Andrews advocated for &quot;Jewish bakers&quot; to have the legal right to refuse to bake cakes for Islamic weddings and the other way around.

==Causes and views==
Andrews was a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party during the Morrison government.

Andrews was associated with, or gave speeches to, many organisations over the years. His most significant non-Parliamentary speeches are published in the volume &quot;One People One Destiny&quot;.

On 9 April 2003, Andrews made a speech to the Endeavour Forum, a conservative Christian group, founded to counter the feminist movement, which opposes abortion, equal opportunity and affirmative action.

Andrews was an adviser to the board of Life Decisions International (LDI), an anti-abortion group. He described his role with LDI as an &quot;honorary patronage&quot;. In 2007, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that, on his entry in the Parliamentary Register of Pecuniary Interests, Andrews did not declare his wife&#x27;s patronage of the board of advisors of Life Decisions International.

Andrews gave several speeches over the years at the Family Council of Victoria, an organisation opposed to homosexuality, sex-education, and anti-homophobia policies in public schools, which it claims is &quot;pro-homosexual indoctrination&quot; of students. He was a vocal public opponent of same-sex marriage and publicly stated he would vote against any bill, regardless of the results of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. He abstained from voting for the bill to legalise same-sex marriage in the Australian Parliament.

Andrews supported immigration as a way to slow population ageing in Australia. During an address to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, he said that &quot;The level of net overseas migration is important as net inflows of migrants to Australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population. Just under 70% of the migrant intake are in the 15â44 age cohort, compared to 43% of the Australian population as a whole. Just 10% of the migrant intake are 45 or over, compared with 38% of the Australian population.&quot;

In 2011, as a Liberal Shadow Cabinet frontbencher, Andrews published a critique of the Greens&#x27; policy agenda in Quadrant Magazine in which he wrote that the Australian Greens&#x27; &quot;objective involves a radical transformation of the culture that underpins Western civilisation&quot; and that their agenda would threaten the &quot;Judeo-Christian/Enlightenment synthesis that upholds the individual&quot; as well as &quot;the economic system that has resulted in the creation of wealth and prosperity for the most people in human history.&quot;

Andrews supported the move to make Australia a republic at the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998.

Andrews was an adjunct lecturer in politics and in marriage education at the John Paul II Institute for Marriage and Family in Melbourne.

He long advocated the critical importance of Australia&#x27;s reliance on natural resources. He is credited with suggesting the title of the Coalition&#x27;s then pro-national resources interest group, the Monash Forum.

He served on many bodies in addition to serving in Parliament since 1991, including the Marriage Education Programme Inc, the Australian Association of Marriage Education, the Newman College council, the Institute for Social NeuroScience, and the council of the National Archives.

He published a policy journal, &quot;Australian Polity&quot;, from 2008 until his death.

==Personal life==
Andrews was a Catholic.

Andrews was a keen cyclist, participating in many charitable rides, including the annual Pollie Pedal event, and competing in Masters racing. His youngest son, Ben, rode as a professional cyclist in Australia, on the Asian circuit, and in the kermesse series in Europe. Andrews&#x27; last book, &quot;Great Rivalries&quot;, is the story of cycling and the history of Italy from 1860 to 1960.

Andrews died on 14 December 2024, at age 69. He had been affected by cancer for a year when he died.

In the 2025 Australia Day Honours Andrews was posthumously appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for &quot;significant service to the people and Parliament of Australia, to the Catholic Church, and to the community.&quot;

<text>Lawrence James Anthony (born 17 December 1961) is an Australian former politician. He was a National Party of Australia member of the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Richmond, New South Wales, from the March 1996 election until his defeat in the 2004 election. He held the seat that was previously held by his father, Doug Anthony, and his grandfather, Larry Anthony, senior. The Anthonys became the first three-generation dynasty in the history of the House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Anthony was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and educated at Canberra Grammar School before attending university at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. He was a businessman and stockbroker before entering politics.

==Politics==
Anthony first ran in Richmond in 1993, losing to Labor incumbent Neville Newellâthe first time that a member of the Anthony family had lost an election. He sought a rematch in 1996, and defeated Newell as part of the Coalition&#x27;s decisive win that year.

However, due to demographic changes over the previous two decades that made Richmond much more compact and urban, Anthony was never able to establish nearly as secure a hold on the seat as his father and grandfather possessed when they held it for 47 consecutive years from 1937 to 1984. He barely held onto his seat in 1998 (against Newell) and 2001, surviving both times on One Nation preferences. In 2004, he was defeated by Labor&#x27;s Justine Elliot, being the only Coalition MP from a rural electorate to lose his seat and the first member of the Anthony family to be unseated at an election. On the seventh count, Elliot picked up a large flow of Green preferences, allowing her to defeat Anthony by 301 votes.

Anthony was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade 1998â99, Minister for Community Services 1999â2001 and Minister for Children and Youth Affairs from 2001 to 2004.

<text>Waterfall is a small suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is south of the Sydney central business district in the Sutherland Shire. It is the southernmost suburb of Sydney in the eastern corridor, on the Princes Highway, bordering Helensburgh. 

==Geography==
Waterfall is bordered to the north by the suburb of Heathcote, with Engadine further north; by The Royal National Park to the east; and by Heathcote National Park to the west. Helensburgh is the next town, traveling south. Waterfall marks the southern border of the Sutherland Shire. It is approximately 230 metres above sea level.

Waterfall has only seven streets. The bushland gives the small suburb a natural surrounding and walking tracks lead from it into the neighbouring national parks. To the west is a dammed lake and behind it is Mount Westmacott.

== History ==
Waterfall began in 1884 as a railway construction workers&#x27; camp and staging point for the construction of the South Coast Railway between Sydney and Wollongong in the late 19th century. The site was the last point where the railway alignment and Illawarra Road (now Princes Highway) were in close proximity. A large number of railway construction workers were needed for the extensive excavation and tunnelling works beyond Waterfall to the south. It is the site of the highest point on the line, with a steep rising gradient at one end, and a falling gradient at the other end, and sidings were provided in both directions to allow freight wagons to be stowed and shunted. A reservoir was built nearby and water pumped to the railway to re-water steam trains after their ascent. The original Waterfalls railway station opened in 1886. This railway station, railway buildings and houses were located 600m to the south of the present station and the school opened nearby. As rail traffic and facilities grew, the railway was duplicated and a larger, permanent settlement became established.

Waterfall derived its name either from the waterfalls close to the railway station or from steam trains re-watering or making their &#x27;fall&#x27; for water. A South Waterfall existed until 1914. McKell Avenue, the southern border of the Royal National Park, was originally called Waterfall Road.

The Waterfall State Sanatorium was established in 1909 for the treatment of tuberculosis patients, some of whom were forcibly quarantined. Later, the facility was used for quarantine treatment during the influenza pandemic. The facility had its own cemetery. Later still, it became the Garrawarra Hospital and Garrawarra Centre aged care facility. Construction of Woronora Dam, southwest of Waterfall, from 1927, contributed to the growth of the settlement. A nudist community was established to the southwest of the settlement. A Boy Scout camp was built on a Crown lease to the west of the settlement. In 1973 Australia&#x27;s first Community Advanced Driver Training Centre was opened in Waterfall but closed a few years later.

Bushfires have been a recurrent danger and destroyed Waterfall houses. On 3 November 1980, five volunteer firefighters were killed by a fireball that engulfed them and their truck on the Uloola track just east of the settlement.

The Waterfall train collision on 20 December 1994 involved two S-set electric trains which collided at low speed in the early hours of the morning during a shunting procedure at Waterfall station in the south of Sydney. Both trains were empty of passengers. Carriages jack-knifed in spectacular fashion onto the platform, causing demolition of a concrete ramp to the overbridge and part of the station canopy.

The Waterfall train disaster on 31 January 2003 involved an interurban train service operated by a Tangara, unit G7, which crashed just south of Waterfall. The cause of G7&#x27;s crash was determined to be the heart attack of the driver and a failure of the safety equipment and the guard to stop the train.

== Heritage listings ==
Waterfall has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Woronora Dam Road: Woronora Dam

==Population==
In the 2021 Census, there were 522 people in Waterfall. 84.1% of people were born in Australia and 92.1% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 44.1% and Anglican 18.0%.

== Transport ==
Waterfall is the last suburb heading south on the Princes Highway before it leads into the Princes Motorway (formerly known as the F6 freeway) to the city of Wollongong.

Waterfall railway station is the terminus for the Sydney Trains suburban Illawarra railway line. However, some trains do terminate one stop further on at Helensburgh. Waterfall is also a stop on the NSW TrainLink South Coast Line, with platform 1 to Central and platform 2 to Port Kembla, Dapto and Kiama.

==Education==
Waterfall&#x27;s local primary school has only two rooms which have kindergarten to 2nd class in one room, and 3rd class to 6th class in another.

==Bushwalking==
Waterfall is connected by a pair of hiking trails, the Couranga and Lake Cooloomba, which lead through vast tracts of bushland within two national parks.

Waterfall also has an unmarked track along Kangaroo Creek, that leads up to the popular swimming hole, Karloo Pool. From the pool, the Uloola Trail can be followed back to the town.

Another hiking trail in Waterfall is the Bullawaring Track, a popular walk that goes through Heathcote National Park, to Heathcote.

<text>Garrison station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Philipstown, New York.

==History==
Rail service in Garrison can be traced as far back as the 1850s with the Hudson River Railroad. Prior to this, the only major transportation in the community was the ferry to West Point. Garrison Landing was built around the station, which, along with the line, was acquired by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad (NYC&amp;HR) in 1864, and like many others on the Hudson Line, it is also right on the Hudson River. In 1892, NYC&amp;HR rebuilt the station with elements of the Italianate, Victorian Gothic and Hudson River Bracketed styles, similar to stations such as Dobbs Ferry. On October 24, 1897, the Garrison train crash occurred south of the station at Kings Dock, resulting in 19 deaths (mostly from drowning) and hundreds of injuries. A pedestrian tunnel was added to the station beneath the tracks in 1929. In April 1945, the station was a stop on the funeral train of Franklin D. Roosevelt, where West Pointers could pay tribute to the dead president as his body was transported to Hyde Park.
The station house became a Penn Central station upon the merger between NYC and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, like many NYCRR stations in Putnam County. Bankruptcy for Penn Central in 1970 forced them to turn passenger service over to the MTA in 1972, even through the period when it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, and then by Metro-North Railroad in 1983 which rebuilt a new station south of the former NYC station house. The former station house became a contributing property to the Garrison Landing Historic District in 1982, and has been the headquarters of the Philipstown Depot Theatre since 1996.

==In popular culture==

The original Garrison Depot building (still standing just north of the current Metro-North station), the surrounding buildings, the overpass, and the tunnel just north of the depot were prominently seen in 1969 film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; during the &quot;Put On Your Sunday Clothes&quot; number. The building was given some retro facade work and was &quot;dressed up&quot; as Yonkers, New York.

==Station layout==
The station has two high-level side platforms each six cars long. The Garrison Landing Historic District is immediately to the northwest of the station.

<doc id="556765" wikidata="Q117444" url="?curid=556765" title="Eugeniusz Bodo">
<text>Eugeniusz Bodo (born Bohdan EugÃ¨ne Junod; 28 December 1899 7 October 1943) was a film director, producer, singer, pianist and one of the most popular Polish actors and comedians of the interwar period. He starred in some of the most popular Polish film productions of the 1930s, including &quot;His Excellency, The Shop Assistant&quot; (Polish: &quot;Jego ekscelencja subiekt&quot;), &quot;Czy Lucyna to dziewczyna?&quot;, and &quot;PieÅniarz Warszawy&quot;.

A skilled singer, he became an icon of Polish musical comedy and a &quot;symbol of Polish commercial cinema&quot;. In the late 1930s he also became a successful entrepreneur â co-owner of a successful film studio, cafÃ©, and producers&#x27; company. Arrested by the Soviet &quot;NKVD&quot; in the aftermath of the German and Soviet invasion of Poland, he perished in the Soviet &quot;Gulag&quot;.

== Biography ==
Bohdan EugÃ¨ne Junod was born on 28 December 1899. His birthplace is uncertain; sources name Warsaw, ÅÃ³dÅº, and Geneva, Switzerland. His mother was Jadwiga Anna Dorota nÃ©e Dylewska. His father, Teodor Junod, was a Swiss citizen who moved to Russian-held Poland and in 1903 settled in ÅÃ³dÅº. There he opened a revue-cinema, &quot;Urania&quot; â the first permanent cinema theatre in that city. It was there that Bodo made his stage debut at the age of six.

In 1917 Junod moved to PoznaÅ where he joined &quot;Teatr Apollo&quot;. In 1919 (under a new stage name of Eugeniusz Bodo, the surname created from the initials of his own first name Bohdan and his mother&#x27;s â Dorota) he started acting in various Warsaw-based theatres, variÃ©tÃ©s and cabarets (&quot;Qui Pro Quo&quot;, &quot;Perskie Oko&quot; and &quot;Cyrulik Warszawski&quot; being the most famous). He also played major roles in Warsaw-based &quot;Teatr Polski&quot; and Wilno-based &quot;Teatr Lutnia&quot;.

He is best known for his film roles; he played in more than thirty films. His screen debut was a 1925 silent film &quot;Rywale&quot;. With the advent of sound film Bodo in a matter of years became one of the best-known Polish actors. Usually appearing in musical comedies, already in 1932 he was voted the &quot;King of Polish Actors&quot; by &quot;Film&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers. His popularity rose following three &quot;mistaken identity&quot; comedies: 1933 &quot;His Excellency, The Shop Assistant&quot;, 1935 &quot;His Excellency, the Chauffeur&quot; (both directed by MichaÅ WaszyÅski and co-starring Ina Benita) and 1934 &quot;Czy Lucyna to dziewczyna?&quot; (co-starring Jadwiga Smosarska). Always appearing well-dressed, in 1936 Bodo was awarded the title of &quot;King of Style&quot; by the readers of Film magazine.

In 1931 Bodo became a co-founder of the B.W.B. film studio, and, in 1933, he opened a private producers&#x27; company &quot;Urania&quot;, named after his fathers&#x27; cinema in ÅÃ³dÅº. His best-known film was &quot;Neighbors&quot; (&quot;PiÄtro wyÅ¼ej&quot;) (1937), which he wrote and produced himself. On 10 January 1939 Bodo with his business partner Zygmunt Woyciechowski opened a restaurant and a cafÃ© â the &quot;CafÃ© Bodo&quot; â at Warsaw&#x27;s prestigious Pierackiego street (modern Foksal). By that time his popularity reached far beyond the borders of Poland, to the extent that Yugoslavian press dubbed him &quot;Polish Maurice Chevalier&quot;. Bodo himself toured Germany promoting Polish-made feature films on that market.

During the invasion of Poland he organized recitals for the Polish soldiers and civilians during the Siege of Warsaw. He then fled to LwÃ³w, where he joined the &quot;Tea-Jazz&quot; band led by Henryk Wars. With that troupe he toured the Soviet Union in 1940, he also published a record containing Russian-language versions of his songs. Simultaneously he started efforts to leave the Soviet Union using his Swiss passport. However, shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union he was arrested by the NKVD and sentenced to 5 years of lager/labor camp as a result of NKVD Interrogation carried out by NKVD chief Pyotr Fedotov signed on 20 October 1942 (source: documents sent to Poland by the Russian Red Cross in 1992). Initially imprisoned in Butyrki prison in Moscow, he was not released following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement as the Soviet authorities argued that he was not a Pole but rather a Swiss citizen and hence the Amnesty for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union did not apply to him. Eugeniusz Bodo starved to death on his way to a remote Soviet gulag camp, in Kotlas. He was declared dead on 7 October 1943.

His whereabouts remained unknown for another 50 years. Before the collapse of communism in 1989, the Soviets gave the false version that Bodo had been murdered by the Germans in 1941. This version is repeated even in some modern publications. It was only in 1991 that the Soviet authorities revealed his fate. The tragic circumstances surrounding Bodo&#x27;s death became the subject of a documentary by StanisÅaw Janicki &quot;Eugeniusz Bodo: Za winy niepopeÅnione&quot; (&quot;For Crimes Not Committed&quot;). The title of the 1997 documentary refers to a 1938 film in which Bodo starred.

In October 2011 in Kotlas, where he died, a cenotaph in his honor was unveiled at a local cemetery.

<doc id="556767" wikidata="Q1619619" url="?curid=556767" title="Grimethorpe">
<text>Grimethorpe is a village in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. As of the 2011 census it has a population of 4,672. Grimethorpe is located in eastern Barnsley, and until the local government reorganisation of 1974, it was part of the Hemsworth district and constituency. The village is part of the North East ward of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council.

For much of the 20th century Grimethorpe&#x27;s economy was rooted in coal mining. Since the 1984â85 miners&#x27; strike, the downscaling of UK coal mining greatly accelerated and international cheap open-cast mining provoked closure of its colliery in May 1993. In 1994 it was regarded as the poorest village in Britain.

There are roads linking the village to some of the country&#x27;s biggest arteries, and the village is home to approximately 51 businesses, including the online fashion retailer ASOS.

==History==
The name Grimethorpe originates from &quot;Grim&#x27;s Torp&quot;, a mixture of Anglo-Saxon and Viking names, meaning a torp or hamlet owned by a Viking named Grimey. Grimethorpe is at the foot of the hill upon which is the village of Brierley. In fact, Grimethorpe was named such as a Norse farm built close to Brierley village. Following the Norman Conquest, the Brierley-Grimethorpe area came under the rule of the De Laceys of Pontefract. In 1066, the village&#x27;s owner was Ernui who was said to have six carucates of land at Brerelia and Hindelia, valued at forty shillings. (A carucate was as much land as could be ploughed in one year by one plough and eight oxen. An acre was as much land as could be ploughed in one day by one plough and a pair of oxen.)
This land was given after the Norman conquest to Airic who was given the whole of Staincross wapentake by Ilbert de Lacey, the Norman of Pontefract. All of Yorkshire was divided into wapentakes, Staincross being the one for the Barnsley area. It was about ten miles from north to south and about twenty miles from east to west, its boundaries being in the northeast the high ridge on which Brierley stands and in the south-west, the watershed of the Pennines. A stone cross called Ladycross was erected near Grimethorpe by the monks of Monk Bretton Priory as a place of sanctuary, there being an old law protecting people on Church lands. The Ladycross figures on many deeds relating to the priory. The Lady referred to in the place names of Ladycross, Ladywell and Ladywood is probably Mary Magdalene to whom Monk Bretton Priory was dedicated.

On a well-hidden site between Brierley and Grimethorpe stood the fortified Manor of Hall Steads (the name means &#x27;hall site&#x27;), which belonged to the early Brearley estate. Hall Steads is not mentioned until 1284 in connection with a later Lord of Brierley Manor. Hall Steads was surrounded first by a high, stone wall and then by a moat. The site covered an area of approximately five acres. The building was mainly of local sandstone and many of the stones can still be seen in the soil. Fragments of 14th and 15th-century pottery have been found amongst these stones.

==Mining==

The 1981 census recorded that 44% of all workers in Grimethorpe were miners. The two pits in the village were &#x27;Grimethorpe&#x27; and &#x27;Ferrymoor&#x27; which merged with &#x27;Riddings&#x27; in 1967, which in turn merged with &#x27;South Kirkby&#x27; in 1985. Grimethorpe colliery was one of the deepest pits in Britain and, following similar mergers with &#x27;Houghton Main&#x27; and &#x27;Dearne Valley&#x27;, employed 6,000 men at the time of its closure in May 1993. During mid-October of the 1984â85 miners&#x27; strike, there was a series of riots in Grimethorpe and local residents complained that the policing was too heavy-handed. Relations between the community and the police remained cold for the next decade.

St Luke&#x27;s Church was built in 1904 after St Paul&#x27;s Church, the church of Brierley, was deemed insufficient to accommodate the village&#x27;s growing population.
==Deprivation==

After the closure of the mines and other local industries, Grimethorpe entered a period of decline. Unemployment was above 50% for much of the 1990s. Long-term deprivation was identified by local social workers, the public sector, and charities by the 2000s. This sparked a period of regeneration and much of the denser basic housing was demolished and replaced with new housing stock.

Historically Grimethorpe had road links to the major compass points without natural barriers but was distant to major cities and its public transport was represented by long-distance bus routes; comparable ex-mining-centric villages in West Yorkshire such as Fitzwilliam and South Elmsall have rail links to Leeds and a greater population supporting local retail and commerce.

==Regeneration projects==

Several regeneration projects have taken place in the village over the years. The Dearne Valley link roads have been constructed and Park Springs Industrial Estate has been developed. This has brought many jobs to the area especially the construction of a huge unit occupied by South Yorkshire-based furniture company Symphony. The ex-regional NCB Offices have been converted into managed workshops and offices for small businesses and named &#x27;The Acorn Centre&#x27;, The largest employer on site is Honest Home Care Ltd which employs over 40 people. The village has seen the construction of four private housing estates, a medical centre, a dental surgery, and a village hall. Regeneration was praised by former Deputy prime minister John Prescott on his visit to the village in March 2010.

Since this time regeneration work has continued with the opening of the large ASOS distribution centre, and many other industrial units on the Park Springs Industrial Estate.

==Education==
The village has two primary schools, Milefield and Ladywood. The village also used to have a secondary school, Willowgarth High School, but it was demolished and replaced with the larger Outwood Academy Shafton, the main secondary school for Grimethorpe, Shafton, Brierley, Cudworth, Monk Bretton, and Lundwood.

The village used to have another school, Springvale Primary School, which burned down in the 1980s. It was replaced with the aforementioned Milefield.

==Band==

Grimethorpe is known for its past as a mining village, its brass band, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and its use as the location for the film &quot;Brassed Off&quot; â a black comedy which tells the plight of the village and the effect on its band. In 2010 Grimethorpe Colliery band recorded a version of the hymn &quot;Jerusalem&quot; which was played when the English team won a gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in India.

==Sport==
Grimethorpe previously had two senior football clubs â Grimethorpe Athletic and Grimethorpe Miners&#x27; Welfare.

In 2018 former Barnsley FC player Bruce Dyer opened a branch of his &#x27;love life&#x27; football academy in the village.

In the Viz comic strip Billy the Fish, the fictional Grimethorpe City is the arch-rival of Fish&#x27;s team Fulchester United.

<doc id="556770" wikidata="Q1100162" url="?curid=556770" title="Manitou station">
<text>Manitou station is a limited-service stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line. It serves the hamlet of Manitou in the southwestern corner of Philipstown in Putnam County, New York. The station is open part-time, serving one weekday peak hour train in each direction and six weekend trains each direction.

The Manitou station is one of three stations â along with Breakneck Ridge on the Hudson Line and Appalachian Trail on the Harlem Line â that receives limited passenger service. Like these stations, it serves mainly hikers visiting nearby state parks in the Hudson Highlands. There is no elevated platform and facilities at the station, one of two on the line adjacent to a grade crossing, are limited to a small shelter with the current schedule posted inside. The station predates the merger of New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads.

This station is the least used station in Putnam County, with only 42 passengers per week in 2018.

== History ==
The station closed on July 1, 1973 along with several other stations in Penn Central&#x27;s Metropolitan Region. It reopened in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station has two short low-level side platforms, which are each long enough for just one door of one car to receive and discharge passengers.

==In popular culture==
The Manitou station was featured in the television series &quot;Girls&quot;, in the episode &quot;Video Games,&quot; in which Lena Dunham&#x27;s character Hannah accompanies Jessa on a visit to her estranged father.

<doc id="556773" wikidata="Q7160175" url="?curid=556773" title="Peekskill station">
<text>Peekskill station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Peekskill, New York.

The former station building built by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1874 still stands, although it is no longer staffed.

==History==
Rail service in Peekskill began on September 29, 1849 with the Hudson River Railroad. The freight depot was the site of a February 19, 1861 visit by Abraham Lincoln who stopped there during his train trip to his inauguration. The railroad was acquired by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in November 1869, and they rebuilt the passenger station in 1874. NYC&amp;HR rebuilt the freight depot around 1890 and today it is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Standard House which served the railroad, as well as ships on the Hudson River.

A 1943 New York Central schedule lists Peekskill as the northern terminus of its Hudson Division commuter service. Trains continuing north of Peekskill were &quot;long distance&quot; trains, continuing not just to Poughkeepsie but also to Albany and other destinations.

With the railroads in decline during the post-WW II era, New York Central merged with their long time rival Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 and the station became a Penn Central station. Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in 1971, but Peekskill station continued to serve only the expanded Penn Central Hudson Division trains which by that time ran to Poughkeepsie and were subsidized by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Conrail took over Penn Central in 1976 and ran Hudson Branch trains as far north as Albany until 1981 when they reverted to Poughkeepsie where it has remained ever since. MTA assigned the station to the newly established Metro-North Commuter Railroad in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station has four tracks and two high-level side platforms each six cars long. Tracks 4 and 6 terminate at the north end of the station while tracks 1 and 2 continue on. The station is located just south of a grade crossing.

<text>Kwela is a pennywhistle-based street music from southern Africa with jazzy underpinnings and a distinctive, skiffle-like beat. It evolved from the marabi sound and brought South African music to international prominence in the 1950s.
The music has its roots in southern Africa but later adaptations of this and many other African folk idioms have permeated Western music (listen to the albums &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Safari&quot; by the Bert Kaempfert Orchestra (1962) and &quot;Graceland&quot; by Paul Simon (1986)), giving modern South African music, particularly jazz, much of its distinctive sound and lilting swagger. The Piranhas&#x27; 1980 UK Top Ten hit &#x27;Tom Hark&#x27; was based on an earlier 1950s Kwela hit song.

One reason for the use of the pennywhistle is that it is cheap and portable, but it also lends itself as a solo or an ensemble instrument. The popularity of the pennywhistle may have been based on the fact that flutes of different kinds have long been traditional instruments among the peoples of the more northerly parts of South Africa and the pennywhistle thus enabled the swift adaptation of folk tunes into the new marabi-influenced music.

==Origin==

The most common explanation for the word &quot;kwela&quot; is that it is taken from the Zulu for &quot;climb&quot;, though in township slang it also referred to police vans, the &quot;kwela-kwela&quot;. Thus, it could be an invitation to join the dance, as well as serving as a warning. It is said that the young men who played the pennywhistle on street corners also acted as lookouts to warn those enjoying themselves in the shebeens of the arrival of the police. White people, unaware of its meaning, then thought that it referred to the music when they heard people shouting &quot;Here comes the kwela, kwela!&quot; warning of the police&#x27;s presence.

Kwela music was influenced by blending the music of Malawian immigrants to South Africa with the local South African sounds. In Chichewa, &quot;kwela&quot; has a similar meaning to the South African one: &quot;to climb&quot;. The music was popularised in South Africa and then brought to Malawi, where contemporary Malawian artists have also begun producing kwela music.
Although it has been asserted that kwela music exclusively uses the chord progression I-IV-Iformula_1-V., others maintain that there is no specific kwela chord progression, or that I-IV-V-I and I-I-IV-V are particularly prevalent.

==Artists==
Artists such as Lemmy Mabaso were renowned for their pennywhistle skills, and Spokes Mashiyane was one of the most prominent with his kwela pennywhistle tunes.
Other artists include The Skylarks, Jack Lerole, Aaron Lerole, The Solven Whistlers, Kippie Moeketsi, Donald Kachamba and Gwigwi Mrwebe.

<text>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a commercial open-source Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the commercial market. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is released in server versions for x86-64, Power ISA, ARM64, and IBM Z and a desktop version for x86-64. Fedora Linux and CentOS Stream serve as its upstream sources. All of Red Hat&#x27;s official support and training, together with the Red Hat Certification Program, focuses on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform.

The first version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to bear the name originally came onto the market as &quot;Red Hat Linux Advanced Server&quot;. In 2003, Red Hat rebranded Red Hat Linux Advanced Server to &quot;Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS&quot; and added two more variants, Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS.

Red Hat previously used strict trademark rules to restrict free re-distribution of their officially supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux but still freely provided its source code. Third-party derivatives were able to be built and redistributed by stripping away non-free components like Red Hat&#x27;s trademarks. Examples include community-supported distributions like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux, and commercial ones like Oracle Linux. In 2023, Red Hat decided to stop making the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux available to the public. The code is still available to Red Hat customers, as well as developers using free accounts, though under conditions that forbid redistribution of the source code.

==Variants==
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server subscription is available at no cost for development purposes. Developers need to register for the Red Hat Developer Program and agree to license terms forbidding production use and redistribution of the source code. This free developer subscription was announced on March 31, 2016.

There are also &quot;Academic&quot; editions of the Desktop and Server variants. They are offered to schools and students, are less expensive, and are provided with Red Hat technical support as an optional extra. Web support based on the number of customer contacts can be purchased separately.

It is often assumed the branding ES, AS, and WS stand for &quot;Entry-level Server&quot;, &quot;Advanced Server&quot; and &quot;Work Station&quot;, respectively. The reason for this is that the ES product is indeed the company&#x27;s base enterprise server product, while AS is the more advanced product. However, nowhere on its site or in its literature does Red Hat say what AS, ES, and WS stand for.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 there are new editions that substitute former Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS/ES/WS/Desktop:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform (former AS)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (former ES) (limited to two CPUs)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Workstation and Multi-OS option
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Workstation option (former WS)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Multi-OS option
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop (former Desktop)

Red Hat had also announced its Red Hat Global Desktop Linux edition &quot;for emerging markets&quot;.

RHEL 4, 3, and prior releases had four variants:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS for mission-critical/enterprise computer systems.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES for supported network servers
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS for technical power user enterprise desktops for high-performance computing
* Red Hat Desktop for multiple deployments of single-user desktops for enterprises.

==Relationship with Fedora Linux==
The Fedora Project provides the following explanation:

Fedora is a free distribution and community project and upstream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Fedora is a general purpose system that gives Red Hat and the rest of its contributor community the chance to innovate rapidly with new technologies. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial enterprise operating system and has its own set of test phases including alpha and beta releases which are separate and distinct from Fedora development.Originally, Red Hat sold boxed versions of Red Hat Linux directly to consumers and business through phone support. The Fedora Project began in 2002 as a set of community supported packages for Red Hat Linux. However, the six month release cycle of Red Hat Linux was too disruptive for business users and Red Hat wanted a more reliable revenue stream. In 2002 Red Hat began releasing Red Hat Enterprise Linux based on Red Hat Linux, but with a much more conservative release cycle and a subscription based support program. A year later, Red Hat discontinued the Red Hat Linux product line, merging it with the Fedora community packages and releasing the resulting Fedora distribution for free.

 RHEL source code is also not freely available, as those that obtain it are forbidden from redistribution. For example, RHEL 5 was forked from Fedora at the end of 2006 (approximately at the time of the Fedora Core 6 release) and released more or less together with Fedora 14. By the time RHEL 6 was released, many features from Fedora 13 and 14 had already been backported into it. The Fedora Project lists the following lineages for older Red Hat Enterprise releases:

* Red Hat Linux 6.2/7 to Red Hat Linux Enterprise Edition 6.2E
* Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.2A to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1
* Red Hat Linux 9 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
* Fedora Core 3 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
* Fedora Core 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Fedora 12, 13 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Fedora 19, 20 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Fedora 28 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* Fedora 34 to CentOS Stream 9 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
* Fedora 40 to CentOS Stream 10 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10

In addition, the Fedora project publishes a set of packages for RHEL called the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL). EPEL packages can be expected to work in RHEL, but it is up to willing community members to maintain the packages and back port any upstream changes. As such, packages &quot;may come and go&quot; during the ten-year lifespan of the RHEL release and Red Hat support plans do not include resolving issues caused by EPEL packages.

==Derivatives==
Originally, Red Hat&#x27;s enterprise product, then known as &quot;Red Hat Linux&quot;, was made freely available to anybody who wished to download it, while Red Hat made money from support. Red Hat then moved towards splitting its product line into &quot;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&quot; which was designed to be stable and with long-term support for enterprise users and Fedora as the community distribution and project sponsored by Red Hat. The use of trademarks prevents verbatim copying of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is derived completely from free and open source software. Until 2023, Red Hat made the source code to its enterprise distribution publicly available through its FTP website. Accordingly, several groups used the source code to compile their own derivatives, typically with changes including the removal of any references to Red Hat&#x27;s trademarks and pointing the update systems to non-Red Hat servers. Groups which have undertaken this include AlmaLinux, CentOS, MIRACLE LINUX, Oracle Linux, CloudLinux OS, Rocky Linux, Scientific Linux, StartCom Enterprise Linux, Pie Box Enterprise Linux, X/OS, Lineox, and Bull&#x27;s XBAS for high-performance computing. However, as of June 2023, Red Hat no longer makes the source code freely available; while they still provide the source code to customers and developers. The GNU GPL forbids terms and conditions that prevent users from redistributing the source code of GPL-licensed software, including but not limited to the GNU core utilities (such as cat, ls, and rm), which is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 or later as of version 6.10, and the Linux kernel itself (licensed under the GPLv2 only). This led to AlmaLinux, one of the RHEL derivative Linux distributions, moving away from &quot;1:1 bug for bug&quot; compatibility to &quot;application binary interface (ABI) compatible&quot;, while Oracle, SUSE, and CIQ (the company behind Rocky Linux) collaborated to form the Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA) in order to provide &quot;open and free Enterprise Linux (EL) source code&quot;.

Derivatives of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are free but do not get any commercial support or consulting services from Red Hat and lack software, hardware or security certifications from Red Hat. They also do not get access to Red Hat services like Red Hat Network.

Unusually, Red Hat took steps to obfuscate their changes to the Linux kernel for RHEL 6.0 by not publicly providing the patch files for their changes in the source tarball, and only releasing the finished product in source form. Speculation suggested that the move was made to affect Oracle&#x27;s competing rebuild and support services, which further modifies the distribution. This practice however, still complies with the GNU GPL since source code is defined as &quot;[the] preferred form of the work for making modifications to it&quot;, and the distribution still complies with this definition. Red Hat&#x27;s CTO Brian Stevens later confirmed the change, stating that certain information (such as patch information) would now only be provided to paying customers to make the Red Hat product more competitive against the growing number of companies offering support for products based on RHEL. CentOS developers had no objections to the change since they do not make any changes to the kernel beyond what is provided by Red Hat. Their competitor Oracle announced in November 2012 that they were releasing a &quot;RedPatch&quot; service, which allows public view of the RHEL kernel changes, broken down by patch.

== Related products and add-ons ==
A number of commercial vendors use Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a base for the operating system in their products. Two of the best known are the Console Operating System in VMware ESX Server and Oracle Linux.

==Version history and timeline==
=== Naming convention ===
Each release is given a codename which is selected by a vote of the developers. The codenames don&#x27;t have a specific pattern (unlike Ubuntu or Debian).

=== RHEL 10 ===
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 beta is available. RHEL 10 is due to reach general availability in mid-2025. 

=== RHEL 9 ===
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 was announced at Red Hat Summit on May 10, 2022, and was officially released on . In this version of the system introduced a Linux Kernel 5.14.0 and Gnome 40.

RHEL 9 was the first to be based on CentOS Stream, itself based on Fedora Linux, while historically RHEL was based directly on Fedora Linux.

The first beta for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (&quot;Plow&quot;), based on Fedora Linux 34, was released on November 3, 2021.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (&quot;Plow&quot;) was released on May 18, 2022. The name &quot;Plow&quot; was the Appalachian Trail nickname for Tim Burke, one of the founders of RHEL and retired leader of RHEL engineering.

==Product life cycle==
The life cycle of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is at least seven years for versions 3 and 4, and spans at least 10 years for versions 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The life cycle comprises several phases of varying length with different degrees of support. During the first phase (&quot;Production 1&quot;), Red Hat provides full support and updates software and hardware drivers. In later phases (&quot;Production 2&quot; and &quot;Production 3&quot;), only security and other important fixes are provided and support for new hardware is gradually reduced.

In the last years of the support lifecycle (after seven years for version 4 and earlier, and after 10 years for version 5 and later), critical and security-related fixes are only provided to customers who pay an additional subscription (&quot;Extended Lifecycle Support Add-On&quot;) that is available for versions 3, 4, 5 and 6. This covers a limited number of packages. Red Hat only supports major version upgrades from version 6 to version 7 and from version 7 to version 8.


===Kernel backporting===
To maintain a stable application binary interface (ABI), Red Hat does not update the kernel version, but instead backports new features to the same kernel version with which a particular version of RHEL has been released. New features are backported throughout the Production 1 phase of the RHEL lifecycle. Consequently, RHEL may use a Linux kernel with a dated version number, yet the kernel is up-to-date regarding not only security fixes, but also certain features. One specific example is the socket option which was added to Linux kernel 3.9, and was subsequently backported and became available since RHEL 6.5, which uses version 2.6.32 of the Linux kernel.

== Extended Update Support (EUS) / Z Tree ==

The Extended Update Support (EUS) allows an organization / company to choose when they change to a new minor version. For the first 6 months of the EUS channel / yum repo, features may be added, but then the channel is locked down so that only bug and security fixes are patched. The organization / company then has 24 months to move to a new EUS branch. EUS allows the organization / company to stay on a minor version if required by a third-party application which is only tested with a particular minor version of RHEL, such as Oracle Database, IBM Db2, IBM Cloud Orchestrator, Hortonworks. There may also be extra costs associated with using the EUS repos/channels depending on the agreement the organization / company has with Red Hat. For more information on what is Included/Excluded from the EUS see.

=== Note ===
* The EUS update mechanism for using older minor version branches is not available to CentOS, Oracle Linux and Scientific Linux, as Red Hat do not publish source packages for rebuilding. As such, projects clearly state to ensure users run on the latest available minor version within a supported major release.

=== Updates ===
In general one can move from z streams to the next version of the z stream.

* The 7.4.z EUS channel after the release of 7.4.
* The 7.5.z EUS channel after the release of 7.5.
Any 7.y.z EUS channel where y is greater than 1.
The standard base channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, which is the most recent minor release aka rhel 7Y where y is the latest greatest.

One can not go back in time, aka 7.5.z to 7.4.z and will NOT be supported.

===RHEL 6===
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was forked from Fedora 12 and contains many backported features from Fedora 13 and 14.

<doc id="556785" wikidata="Q5173353" url="?curid=556785" title="Cortlandt station">
<text>Cortlandt station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Montrose, New York. Trains leave for New York City every hour on weekdays, and about every 25 minutes during rush hour. It is from Grand Central Terminal and travel time to Grand Central is about 62 minutes.

== History ==
Cortlandt is the second newest station on the Hudson Line (and seventh-newest on the Metro-North system). The station replaced the low-level Montrose and Crugers stations at a point midway between them on June 30, 1996. Those stations were replaced as part of the last stage of expanding the Hudson Line to six-car high-level platforms. They could not be extended because of the curvature of their platforms. Cortlandt is the first station north of CrotonâHarmon, where electrification begins southbound.

On February 15, 2012, Metro-North completed the expansion project of the station. The new facility includes an overpass extension that ties the original station east of the tracks with a new entrance on the west side off NYÂ 9A near the VA Hospital, new parking and a landscaped, canopy-covered, intermodal drop-off plaza. The new overpass has a spacious, heated waiting area with numerous benches and a coffee concession.

==Station layout==
The station has one six-car-long high-level island platform.

<doc id="556799" wikidata="Q12317810" url="?curid=556799" title="Thujopsis">
<text>Thujopsis () is a genus of conifers in the cypress family (Cupressaceae), the sole member of which is Thujopsis dolabrata. It is endemic to Japan, where it is known as asunaro (). It is similar to the closely related genus &quot;Thuja&quot; (arborvitae), differing in its broader, thicker leaves and cones.

== Etymology ==
A popular allegory for the etymology of &quot;asunaro&quot; is &quot;asu wa hinoki ni narou&quot; (), literally &quot;tomorrow it will become a hinoki cypress&quot;, i.e. the tree looks like a smaller version of the common hinoki cypress. 

In Japan, it is also known as hiba (), among many regional variations: asunaro is called &quot;ate&quot; () in Ishikawa, &quot;atebi&quot; on Sado Island, among other names. Outside of Japan, it is also known as false arborvitae or hiba arborvitae.

== Description ==
&quot;Thujopsis&quot; is a medium to large evergreen tree, reaching up to 40 m tall and 1.5 m trunk diameter, with red-brown bark which peels in vertical strips. The leaves are arranged in decussate pairs, scale-like, 3â10Â mm long, glossy green above, and marked with vivid white stomatal bands below; they have a distinctive thick, almost fleshy texture. The seed cones are ovoid, 7â15Â mm long and 6â10Â mm diameter, with 6â12 thick scales, brown with a violet-white wax bloom when fresh. A characteristic extractive, a natural product named as thujaplicinol, has been found in this species, mostly in its needles, outer bark and xylem.

== Taxonomy ==
There are two varieties:
* &quot;Thujopsis dolabrata&quot; var. &quot;dolabrata&quot;. Central and southern Japan. Shoots less densely branched with slightly larger leaves, and strongly thickened cone scales.
* &quot;Thujopsis dolabrata&quot; var. &quot;hondai&quot;. Northern Japan. Shoots more densely branched with slightly smaller leaves, and less thickened cone scales.

==Uses==
The &quot;asunaro&quot; is a valued ornamental tree both in its native Japan, where it is commonly planted around temples as well as in gardens, and also in Europe and North America. In the latter two regions, planting is confined to areas with good rainfall or in gardens with reliable irrigation, as the species is not drought tolerant. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

It is also used to a small extent in forestry in Japan, grown for the valuable wood, which is durable and scented, similar to that of &quot;Thuja plicata&quot;.

<text>Clover Margaret Moore (nÃ©e Collins, born 22 October 1945) is an Australian politician. She has been the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney since 2004 and is currently the longest serving Lord Mayor of Sydney since the creation of the City of Sydney in 1842. She was an independent member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 2012, representing the electorates of Bligh (1988â2007) and Sydney (2007â2012). Moore is the first popularly elected woman Lord Mayor of Sydney.

==Early life and education==
Clover Margaret Collins was born on 22 October 1945 and grew up in the suburb of Gordon, on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. 

She attended Loreto Kirribilli at Kirribilli and Elm Court Dominican Convent, Moss Vale. Moore matriculated to the University of Sydney, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1969 and a Diploma of Education from the Sydney Teachers&#x27; College, while residing at Sancta Sophia College. 

After graduation she began work as an English and history teacher at St Ives High School and Fort Street High School, before moving to London to teach for several years. Moore married Peter Moore, an architect, before returning to Australia.

==Local government==
As a young mother in the Labor Party-dominated South Sydney Municipal Council, Moore became involved in a local resident action group. She decided to run for Council in 1980, after she and other members of the group had met, after three years of attempts, with then-mayor, Bill Hartup regarding a local park. Hartup had demanded to have its grass replaced with asphalt (to aid street-sweepers in seeing broken glass), surrounded by barbed wire (to keep out the drunks at night), and to have its lone tree removed (a nuisance).

Moore was elected as an independent alderman for Redfern Ward on South Sydney Municipal Council at the 1980 local government elections. Moore was one of three independents elected to the Council that formed a de facto opposition to the 9-member Labor caucus and Mayor Hartup who controlled the council and generally made most decisions in closed caucus meetings prior to Council meetings. However, in December 1981, the New South Wales Government amalgamated the South Sydney Council with the City of Sydney, and Moore became a Redfern Ward Alderman of the newly formed Sydney City Council from 1 January 1982. Moore developed a visible profile in the community, campaigning on a variety of issues both in her position as alderman and in the broader community, particularly in her home suburb of Redfern. Moore was interested in the environment, conservation, and heritage preservation, being involved in the unsuccessful campaign to save the 1936 Rural Bank Building in Martin Place and describing the ALP Lord Mayor, Doug Sutherland, as the &quot;Judas of Martin Place&quot; for his role in approving its demolition in 1982.

Moore ran again for re-election to the three-member Redfern Ward in the 14 April 1984 Council Election, and was highly successful, taking first position, outpolling Bill Hartup with a 21% swing against the ALP, and enabling the election of the second candidate on her independent ticket, Sue Willis, ahead of the sitting Labor Alderman Stan Champley. In May 1984, Moore ran for the position of Deputy Lord Mayor after the election, but was defeated by the main right-wing Labor candidate, Stan Ashmore-Smith, when the two Independent Communist Aldermen (Jack Mundey and Brian McGahen) sided with the Labor caucus in the vote. Moore proved a high profile campaigner on heritage preservation and environment conservation, gaining the ire of the Miscellaneous Workers&#x27; Union when she confronted a Council worker who was undertaking unsympathetic pruning to trees on a street in Redfern exclaiming &quot;its hard enough for trees to survive city pollution without their being massacred by untrained workmen sent to prune them&quot;, and denouncing the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust as &quot;architectural barbarians, insensitive to the traditions of the ground&quot; for approving the demolition of the historic 1909 Sheridan Stand of the Sydney Cricket Ground, which was nonetheless razed in 1986.

In late 1986, Moore started her campaign to become the city&#x27;s first female Lord Mayor and defeat incumbent Doug Sutherland, declaring &quot;I think everyone would agree it is time for a breath of fresh air and a Lord Mayor committed enough to stay in Sydney to do the job&quot; in a criticism of Sutherland&#x27;s frequent international trips. However, in March 1987 the state government abruptly sacked the Sydney City Council and appointed a board of commissioners to run it until new elections could be held. Having been unceremoniously dismissed from her elected office, Moore, along with five other fellow former independent aldermen Frank Sartor, Bill Hunt, Brian McGahen, Sue Willis and Jack Mundey, formed Independent Watch, an informal grouping with the purpose of scrutinising the decisions of the appointed commissioners and pressing for elections for a new council.

==Member of Parliament==

Instead of standing again for council, Moore decided to run for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent at the 1988 election, like her previous rival for the Lord Mayor position and fellow former independent alderman, Frank Sartor, who had decided to run as an independent in the inner Sydney seat of McKell. Despite not having the backing of a party, she won the seat of Bligh, narrowly defeating Liberal member Michael Yabsley.

In 1991, she co-authored the New South Wales Charter of Reform of Government. In the same year, she was re-elected for a second term with a massive swing in her favour, increasing her share from 26.7 per cent to 43 per cent. Her power also increased dramatically when, along with fellow independents Peter Macdonald and Tony Windsor, she gained the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly. Moore was to again take the spotlight when the Independent Commission Against Corruption handed down a finding that was sharply critical of Liberal Premier Nick Greiner on 1 June 1992. While the findings were still pending a ruling in the NSW Court of Appeals, Moore and two other Independent MPs made a symbolic march to the NSW Parliament with a threat to withdraw their support of the Coalition&#x27;s minority government. Hence before the Court ruling was handed down, Greiner&#x27;s hand was forced, and he resigned on 24 June 1992.

She went on to hold her seat with a largely safe margin at the 1995 and 1999 elections. The LGBT community thanked her for her support by featuring likenesses of her in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade that year. She was re-elected again in 2003.

Prior to the 2007 election, the Electoral Commission redistributed electoral boundaries, renaming Bligh to &quot;Sydney&quot;, and moving the seat north and west to encompass the Sydney CBD. Moore was elected to the new seat of Sydney.

Although she sat as an independent in parliament, Moore often worked with other minor parties and independents, particularly with the Australian Democrats, who sponsored some of her bills in the upper house and Moore encouraged voters at the 2011 state election to vote for the Democrats in the upper house, along with South Coast Independent MP, John Hatton.

Moore resigned as a state MP as a result of new state laws (labelled in the media as the &quot;Get Clover&quot; laws) preventing dual membership of state parliament and local councils. Following her re-election as mayor in the 2012 elections, she was forced to resign the state seat she held for 24 years before the first meeting of the new council. This resulted in a 2012 Sydney by-election on 27 October in which she endorsed independent candidate Alex Greenwich of the Australian Marriage Equality advocacy group who won in a landslide victory.

==Lord Mayor of Sydney==

In early 2004, the Labor Party government under Bob Carr sacked and re-amalgamated the City of Sydney and South Sydney Councils. The move came largely as a surprise, with then-Lord Mayor Lucy Turnbull being notified by a fax posted under her door. The decision to amalgamate the two councils was widely interpreted by the media as an attempt to get the Labor candidate, former federal minister Michael Lee, elected as Lord Mayor, as it would bring a large area of largely Labor-voting suburbs into the City of Sydney. However, several of these suburbs also made up Moore&#x27;s state electorate of Bligh.

When Turnbull announced soon after that she would not seek re-election, Lee appeared to have the position won. Then, on 24 February, Moore entered the race, labelling the council&#x27;s sacking a &quot;cynical grab for power.&quot; Despite her ideological differences with Turnbull, she also sharply denounced the sacking of a democratically elected mayor. By the following day, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; was already predicting that she would present a serious challenge to Lee. Moore won the election, finishing with more than double the vote of Lee, and ABC election analyst Antony Green announced that she would &quot;romp through&quot; to win, only 90 minutes after counting began. This made her the first popularly elected woman Lord Mayor of Sydney.

In 2008 NSW local government elections Moore was re-elected as Lord Mayor of Sydney. She was returned on a reduced majority in 2012, winning 51.1% of the Mayoral vote. At the 2016 election she was comfortably returned to office, improving her vote 8.0% to win 59.1% of the popular vote.

After introducing bike lanes through many parts of inner Sydney, Moore broke an ankle on &quot;Ride to Work Day&quot; in October 2010, while dismounting from her bike, necessitating that she attend some events in a wheelchair.

===Energy efficiency===
Under Moore&#x27;s leadership, the city of Sydney is aiming to reduce carbon emissions 70 per cent by 2030. It has installed bicycle lanes; upgraded its car fleet to hybrids; planted 10,000 trees; provided 600 on-street car-share spaces; installed Sydney&#x27;s largest building-based solar photovoltaic system; installed water harvesting in 11 major parks and voted to install two new trigeneration plants.

Moore stated in an article on Impakter.com in September 2018 that emissions in Sydney have been reduced by 52% and the use of water by 36% since the year 2006 and that the city aims to become carbon neutral.

===Building and infrastructure===
Moore has overseen the construction of the:
* Surry Hills City of Sydney Library by FJMT (Francis-Jones Morehen Thorpe)

She introduced a system of cycleways within the City of Sydney. These angered some local residents for reducing parking, and critics attacked the cost, while other groups, including local headmasters and school groups, applauded them. The Bourke Street Cycleway won a Sydney Design Award in 2012. The state government removed one, subsequently reinstated, and co-funded another one down Oxford Street, noting that cycling increased with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

===Controversies===
On 27 October 2007, Moore proposed a Private Members Bill that would ban the sale of dogs, cats and other mammals in NSW pet stores, and effectively ban the breeding of crossbred dogs. The Pet Industry Association responded with a petition opposing the legislation. The RSPCA Australia gave its support to the measure, although it was rejected by NSW purebred dog breeders.

The &quot;City of Sydney Amendment (Elections) Bill&quot; became law in September 2014, replacing one optional vote per business with two compulsory votes.

Between 2014 and 2017 &quot;Cloud Arch&quot;, a steel sculpture intended to be installed over George Street in Sydney, had its budget rise from to 11.3 million dollars. It was criticised for both the rise in cost, after a re-design, and for not being suited to the city&#x27;s aesthetic.

In 2023 Moore proposed cutting Moore Park Golf Course from 18 holes to 9, in order to create a new park, which drew criticism from golfers, who suggested that it was her self-interest which drove the proposal, as Moore lives nearby. The state government supports the move, and the park was in its planning stages .

==Honours==
Moore was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;distinguished service to local government, to the people and Parliament of New South Wales, and to the community of Sydney&quot;.

<doc id="556818" wikidata="Q3096334" url="?curid=556818" title="CrotonâHarmon station">
<text>CrotonâHarmon station () is a train station in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. It serves the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line and all Amtrak lines running along the Empire Corridor. It is the main transfer point between the Hudson Line&#x27;s local and express service and marks the northern endpoint of third-rail electrification on the route.

Nearly all electric trains running on the Hudson Line originate and terminate here, though a handful of peak-direction rush hour trains do so further south at Greystone, Irvington, or Tarrytown. As the line&#x27;s electrification ends just north of the station, trains traveling to or from points north (primarily the northern terminus, Poughkeepsie) are powered by dual-mode (electric/diesel) GE P32AC-DM locomotives.

==History==

The Hudson River Railroad, one of the forerunners of the New York Central Railroad, ran commuter trains to Poughkeepsie via Croton-on-Hudson as early as 1849. However, little is known of what became of earlier stations. The present station dates from the late 1950s, and was expanded to a multi-level facility in 1988.

Until April 1963, the station was known as simply Harmon. Trains continuing north of Harmon, including the flagship &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;, would exchange their electric locomotive for a steam or diesel locomotive to continue the journey to points north and west.

As of August 2006, daily commuter ridership was 3368 and there are 1903 parking spots.

The &quot;Berkshire Flyer&quot; began running on July 8, 2022, providing direct service to on summer weekends.
==Station layout==
The Village of Croton-on-Hudson operates the station parking lot. A great number of spots are reserved for long-term permit holders and village residents. There is also ample parking for daily use.

The station has three high-level island platforms, each 10 cars long.

<doc id="556829" wikidata="Q360235" url="?curid=556829" title="Ma'anshan">
<text>Ma&#x27;anshan (), also colloquially written as Maanshan, is a prefecture-level city in the eastern part of Anhui province in Eastern China. An industrial city stretching across the Yangtze River, Ma&#x27;anshan borders Hefei to the west, Wuhu to the southwest, and Nanjing to the east. It is a satellite city in the Nanjing metropolitan area and is also a city in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone.

As of the 2020 census, Ma&#x27;anshan was home to 2,159,930 inhabitants, of whom 1,253,960 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of Huashan and Yushan urban districts and Dangtu County, which is largely urbanized.

One can notice that Ma&#x27;anshan is now being conurbated with Nanjing making a combined built-up area of 8,419,252 inhabitants.
After the August 2011 administrative re-regionalization of Anhui Province, its population rose to 2.16 million, as two additional counties (&quot;He&quot; and &quot;Hanshan&quot;) were placed under its administration.

==Administration==

==Name==
The name of the city means &quot;Horse Saddle Mountain&quot;. According to legend, the name came to be when the Western Chu hegemon Xiang Yu was fleeing from the Battle of Gaixia. Rather than be captured, the defeated general killed himself at the area now known as Ma&#x27;anshan after ensuring that his beloved horse would be ferried across the river to safety. Upon seeing his master die, the grief-stricken horse leapt into the river and was drowned. As a tribute, the boatman buried the horse&#x27;s saddle on a nearby hill, giving Ma&#x27;anshan its name.

== City Flower and City Tree ==
Osmanthus fragrans is the city flower of Ma&#x27;anshan and is widely planted in Ma&#x27;anshan. The climate of Ma&#x27;anshan is more rainy and mild, suitable for the growth of sweet-scented osmanthus. Generally from mid-September to Chinese National Day, the sweet-scented osmanthus blooms.

Camphor tree is the city tree of Ma&#x27;anshan. Camphor trees are very popular among residents of Ma&#x27;anshan. Residents of Ma&#x27;anshan City often regard camphor trees as landscape trees and feng shui trees. Feng shui in China means warding off evil spirits, longevity and good luck.

==History==
The south bank of the Yangtze River from Ma&#x27;anshan upstream for , has long been a mining area. The coming of a railroad and the opening of the Huai-nan coalfield in the 1930s made it possible for the Japanese to open an iron and steel works in 1938. Although destroyed at the end of the Second World War, the industries were restored to production in 1953, and Ma&#x27;anshan grew rapidly under the Communists&#x27; first and second Five-Year Plans. Ma&#x27;anshan also has sulfur and limestone mines, and chemical and cement factories.
In 1954, Ma&#x27;anshan was elevated to town level, and, on October 12, 1956, Ma&#x27;anshan City was declared to be founded.

==Geography and climate==

Surrounded by low hills (the name of the city means &quot;horse saddle mountain&quot;), Ma&#x27;anshan is not as polluted as other major Chinese steelmaking cities, thanks to the environmental policies taken by the local government that granted the city the recognition as one of the &quot;Ten Green Cities of China.&quot;

Its climate is similar to other cities in the Yangtze River Delta, with lower humidity that makes its summers and winters less extreme. There are frequent showers during July and August.

Caishi Rock (; ), a famous ancient battlefield from the JinâSong Wars lying to the southwest of the city, is regarded as the best of three rocks that project over the Yangtze River. Taibai pavilion is one of four famous pavilions along the Yangtze river. Caishi scenic area is a national tourism spot, with a combination of natural and cultural attractions.

==Economy==
The main industry is the steel industry (MaGang) which employs much of the workforce of Ma&#x27;anshan. 
At present (2005) major expansions of the steel plant are underway to increase production drastically.

Ma&#x27;anshan city has an annual manufacture investment ranking No.1 in Anhui Province and her GDP ranks No.4 in Anhui Province after Hefei, Anqing and Wuhu. Ma&#x27;anshan&#x27;s population ranks No.16 in the province and has a GDP per capita of US$7,118 which is No.1 in Anhui Province and near the average of Yangtze River Delta.

Maanshan has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Ma&#x27;anshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.

* Bowang Wind fish: When wind fish was founded, the exact age is no longer available. There is a saying that in the late Qing Dynasty, an outsider was involved in the management of fishing in the Shijiu Lake area of Bowang. Since there were a lot of bream fish, and they could not be refrigerated in that era, he created a way to dry the fish for long-term preservation. It was recognized as a national green food in 2008.

<doc id="556838" wikidata="Q795556" url="?curid=556838" title="Common tailorbird">
<text>The common tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius) is a songbird found across tropical Asia. Popular for its nest made of leaves &quot;sewn&quot; together and immortalized by Rudyard Kipling as &quot;Darzee&quot; in his &quot;Jungle Book&quot;, it is a common resident in urban gardens. Although shy birds that are usually hidden within vegetation, their loud calls are familiar and give away their presence. They are distinctive in having a long upright tail, greenish upper body plumage and rust coloured forehead and crown. This passerine bird is typically found in open farmland, scrub, forest edges and gardens. Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider silk to make a cradle in which the actual nest is built. Punjab tailor birds produce shiny red eggs, but became extinct around 1975 due to laying their eggs in fields used to grow fodder crops.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The scientific name &quot;sutorius&quot; means &quot;cobbler&quot; rather than &quot;tailor&quot; while &quot;Orthotomus&quot; means &quot;straight-cutting&quot;.

The species was earlier placed in the family Sylviidae but more recent molecular studies place the species within the family Cisticolidae, along with &quot;Prinia&quot; and &quot;Cisticola&quot;.

A number of subspecies are recognized within its widespread range in South Asia and Southeast Asia.

* &quot;O.s. sutorius&quot;: Lowlands of Sri Lanka
* &quot;O.s. fernandonis&quot;: Highlands of Sri Lanka
* &quot;O.s. guzuratus&quot;: Indian peninsula, West to Pakistan
* &quot;O.s. patia&quot;: The Terai of Nepal along the Himalayan foothills until Myanmar. A small population of &quot;O. s. patia&quot; is also found in the northern Eastern Ghats (Wangasara).
* &quot;O.s. luteus&quot;: Hills of Northeast India
* &quot;O.s. inexpectatus&quot; and &quot;O.s. maculicollis&quot;: Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam
* &quot;O. s. inexpectatus&quot; and &quot;O. s. maculicollis:&quot; South east China, including the island of Hainan
* &quot;O. s. longicauda&quot;: Tonkin in Vietnam
* &quot;O. s. edela&quot;: Java

==Description==
The common tailorbird is a brightly coloured bird, with bright green upperparts and creamy underparts. They range in size from and weigh . They have short rounded wings, a long tail, strong legs and a sharp bill with curved tip to the upper mandible. They are wren-like with a long upright tail that is often moved around. The crown is rufous and the upperparts are predominantly olive green. The underside is creamy white. The sexes are identical, except that the male has long central tail feathers in the breeding season, although the reliability of sexing data accompanying museum specimens used in determining this sexual dimorphism has been questioned. Young birds are duller. When calling, the dark patches on the sides of the neck become visible. These are due to the dark pigmented and bare skin that are present in both sexes and sometimes give the appearance of a dark gorget.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Like most warblers, the common tailorbird is insectivorous. The song is a loud &quot;&quot; with variations across the populations. The disyllabic calls are repeated often. Tailorbirds are found singly or in pairs, usually low in the undergrowth or trees, sometimes hopping on the ground. They forage for insects and have been known to feed on a range of beetles and bugs. They are attracted to insects at flowers and are known to favour the inflorescences of mango. They also visit flowers such as those of &quot;Bombax&quot;, &quot;Salmalia&quot; for nectar and are sometimes covered in pollen, giving them a golden-headed appearance.

The birds roost alone during the non-breeding season but may roost side-by-side during the breeding season, sometimes with the newly fledged juvenile sandwiched between the adults. The roost sites chosen are thin twigs on trees with cover above them and were often close to human habitation and lights.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is March to December peaking from June to August in India, coinciding with the wet season. In Sri Lanka the main breeding periods are March to May and August to September, although they can breed throughout the year.

Although the name is derived from their nest construction habit, the nest is not unique and is also found in many &quot;Prinia&quot; warblers. The nest is a deep cup, lined with soft materials and placed in thick foliage and the leaves holding the nest have the upper surfaces outwards making it difficult to spot. The punctures made on the edge of the leaves are minute and do not cause browning of the leaves, further aiding camouflage. The nest lining of a nest in Sri Lanka that was studied by Casey Wood was found to be lined with lint from &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; and &quot;Bombax malabaricum&quot; species. Jerdon wrote that the bird made knots, however no knots are used. Wood classified the processes used by the tailorbird in nest as sewing, rivetting, lacing and matting. In some cases the nest is made from a single large leaf, the margins of which are rivetted together. Sometimes the fibres from one rivet are extended into an adjoining puncture and appearing more like sewing. The stitch is made by piercing two leaves and drawing fibre through them. The fibres fluff out on the outside and in effect they are more like rivets. There are many variations in the nest and some may altogether lack the cradle of leaves. One observer noted that the birds did not utilize cotton that was made available while another observer, Edward Hamilton Aitken, was able to induce them to use artificially supplied cotton. The usual clutch is three eggs.

The incubation period is about 12 days. Both male and female feed the young. Mortality of eggs and chicks is high due to predation by rodents, cats, crow-pheasants, lizards and other predators. The young birds fledge in about 14 days. The female alone incubates according to some sources, while others suggest that both sexes incubate; however, both parents take part in feeding and sanitation. The males are said to feed the incubating female. An unusual case of a pair of tailorbirds adopting chicks in an artificially translocated nest belonging to a different pair has been recorded. Nests are sometimes parasitized by the Plaintive Cuckoo (&quot;Cacomantis merulinus&quot;).

==In culture==
&quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot;, one of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot; stories, includes a tailorbird couple, &quot;Darzee&quot; (which means &quot;tailor&quot; in Urdu) and his wife, as two of the key characters. Darzee&#x27;s wife is said to have feigned injury, but this behaviour is unknown in this species. A classic book of children&#x27;s folk tales in Bengali by Upendrakishore Ray is titled &quot;Tuntunir Boi&quot;, after the local name for the species, &quot;tuntuni&quot;.

<text>Ernst Alfred Cassirer ( ; ; July 28, 1874 â April 13, 1945) was a German philosopher. Trained within the Neo-Kantian Marburg School, he initially followed his mentor Hermann Cohen in attempting to supply an idealistic philosophy of science.

After Cohen&#x27;s death in 1918, Cassirer developed a theory of symbolism and used it to expand the &quot;logic and psychology of thought&quot; into a more general &quot;logic of the cultural sciences&quot;. Cassirer was one of the leading 20th-century advocates of philosophical idealism. His most famous work is the &quot;Philosophy of Symbolic Forms&quot; (1923â1929).

Though his work received a mixed reception shortly after his death, more recent scholarship has remarked upon Cassirer&#x27;s role as a strident defender of the moral idealism of the Enlightenment era and the cause of liberal democracy at a time when the rise of fascism had made such advocacy unfashionable. Within the international Jewish community, Cassirer&#x27;s work has additionally been seen as part of a long tradition of thought on ethical philosophy.

==Biography==
Cassirer was born in Breslau in Silesia (modern-day southwest Poland), into a Jewish family. After graduating from Johannesgymnasium Breslau he studied Jurisprudence at Friedrich Wilhelms UniversitÃ¤t Berlin and Leipzig University, Germanic Philology, Contemporary Literary History, and Philosophy at Ruprecht Karls UniversitÃ¤t Heidelberg and Friedrich Wilhelms UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, and Philosophy and Psychology at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He then did his doctoral work at University of Marburg where he studied Philosophy under Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp and Mathematics under Friedrich Schottky. In 1899 he graduated with a dissertation on RenÃ© Descartes&#x27;s analysis of mathematical and natural scientific knowledge entitled [&quot;Descartes&#x27; Critique of Mathematical and Scientific Knowledge&quot;]) and completed his habilitation in 1906 at the University of Berlin with the dissertation [&quot;The Problem of Knowledge in Philosophy and Science in the Modern Age: Volume I&quot;]).

Politically, Cassirer supported the liberal German Democratic Party (DDP). After working for many years as a at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, Cassirer was elected in 1919 to the philosophy chair at the newly founded University of Hamburg, where he lectured until 1933, supervising amongst others the doctoral theses of Joachim Ritter and Leo Strauss. 
On 30 January 1933, the Nazi Regime came to power. Cassirer left Germany on 12 March 1933 â one week after the first Reichstagswahl under that Regime â because he was Jewish.

After leaving Germany he taught for a couple of years at the University of Oxford, before becoming a professor at Gothenburg University. When Cassirer considered Sweden too unsafe, he applied for a post at Harvard University, but was rejected because thirty years earlier he had rejected a job offer from them. In 1941 he became a visiting professor at Yale University, then moved to Columbia University in New York City, where he lectured from 1943 until his death in 1945.

Cassirer died of a heart attack in April 1945 in New York City. The young rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, who was a student of Cassirer&#x27;s at Columbia University, conducted the funeral service. His grave is located in Westwood, New Jersey, on the Cedar Park BethâEl Cemeteries in the graves of the Congregation Habonim. His son, Heinz Cassirer, was also a Kantian scholar. 

Other members of his prominent family included the neurologist Richard Cassirer, the publisher and gallery owner Bruno Cassirer and the art dealer and editor Paul Cassirer.

==Influences==
Donald Phillip Verene, who published some of Cassirer&#x27;s papers kept at Yale University, gave this overview of his ideas:
&quot;Cassirer as a thinker became an embodiment of Kantian principles, but also of much more, of an overall movement of spirit stretching from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, and on to Herder&#x27;s conception of history, Goethe&#x27;s poetry, Wilhelm von Humboldt&#x27;s study of the Kavi language, Schelling&#x27;s , Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, and Vischer&#x27;s conception of the aesthetic symbol, among many others. Cassirer&#x27;s own position is born through a mastery of the whole development of this world of the humanistic understanding, which included the rise of the scientific world view â a mastery evident both in his historical works and in his systematic philosophy.&quot;

==Work==

===History of science===
Cassirer&#x27;s first major published writings were a history of modern thought from the Renaissance to Kant. In accordance with his Marburg neo-Kantianism he concentrated upon epistemology. His reading of the Scientific Revolution, in books such as &quot;The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy&quot; (1927), as a &quot;Platonic&quot; application of mathematics to nature, influenced historians such as E. A. Burtt, E. J. Dijksterhuis, and Alexandre KoyrÃ©.

===Philosophy of science===
In &quot;Substance and Function&quot; (1910), he writes about late nineteenth-century developments in physics including relativity theory and the foundations of mathematics. In &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity&quot; (1921) he defended the claim that modern physics supports a neo-Kantian conception of knowledge. He also wrote a book about Quantum mechanics called &quot;Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics&quot; (1936).

===Philosophy of symbolic forms===
At Hamburg Cassirer discovered the Library of the Cultural Sciences founded by Aby Warburg. Warburg was an art historian who was particularly interested in ritual and myth as sources of surviving forms of emotional expression. In &quot;Philosophy of Symbolic Forms&quot; (1923â29) Cassirer argues that man (as he put it in his more popular 1944 book &quot;Essay on Man&quot;) is a &quot;symbolic animal&quot;. Whereas animals perceive their world by instincts and direct sensory perception, humans create a universe of symbolic meanings. Cassirer is particularly interested in natural language and myth. He argues that science and mathematics developed from natural language, and religion and art from myth.

===The CassirerâHeidegger debate===

In 1929 Cassirer took part in a historically significant encounter with Martin Heidegger in Davos during the Second Davos Hochschulkurs (the CassirerâHeidegger debate). Cassirer argues that while Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; emphasizes human temporality and finitude, he also sought to situate human cognition within a broader conception of humanity. Cassirer challenges Heidegger&#x27;s relativism by invoking the universal validity of truths discovered by the exact and moral sciences.

===&quot;Philosophy of the Enlightenment&quot;===
Cassirer believed that reason&#x27;s self-realization leads to human liberation. Mazlish (2000), however, notes that Cassirer in his &quot;The Philosophy of the Enlightenment&quot; (1932) focuses exclusively on ideas, ignoring the political and social context in which they were produced.

===&quot;The Logic of the Cultural Sciences&quot;===
In &quot;The Logic of the Cultural Sciences&quot; (1942) Cassirer argues that objective and universal validity can be achieved not only in the sciences, but also in practical, cultural, moral, and aesthetic phenomena. Although inter-subjective objective validity in the natural sciences derives from universal laws of nature, Cassirer asserts that an analogous type of inter-subjective objective validity takes place in the cultural sciences.

===&quot;The Myth of the State&quot;===
Cassirer&#x27;s last work, &quot;The Myth of the State&quot; (1946), was published posthumously; at one level it is an attempt to understand the intellectual origins of Nazi Germany. Cassirer sees Nazi Germany as a society in which the dangerous power of myth is not checked or subdued by superior forces. The book discusses the opposition of logos and mythos in Greek thought, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, the medieval theory of the state, Machiavelli, Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s writings on hero worship, the racial theories of Arthur de Gobineau, and Hegel. Cassirer claimed that in 20th-century politics there was a return, with the passive acquiescence of Martin Heidegger, to the irrationality of myth, and in particular to a belief that there is such a thing as destiny. Of this passive acquiescence, Cassirer says that in departing from Husserl&#x27;s belief in an objective, logical basis for philosophy, Heidegger attenuated the ability of philosophy to oppose the resurgence of myth in German politics of the 1930s.

<text>Wojciech Å»ywny (; 13 May 175621 February 1842) was a Czech-born Polish pianist, violinist, teacher and composer. He was FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin&#x27;s first professional piano teacher.

== Life ==
Å»ywny was born in MÅ¡eno, Bohemia, and became a pupil of Jan KuchaÅ. As a youth, during the reign of StanisÅaw August Poniatowski, he moved to Poland to become the music tutor to the children of Princess Sapieha. He later moved to Warsaw.

He was the first professional piano teacher of FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin, who received lessons from him between 1816 and 1821. Å»ywny instilled in Chopin a lasting love of Bach, Haydn, Clementi and Mozart while avoiding contemporary composers like Beethoven and Weber. Chopin&#x27;s piano skills soon surpassed those of his respected teacher. In 1821, eleven-year-old Chopin dedicated a Polonaise in A-flat major to Å»ywny as a name-day gift.

Å»ywny died in February 1842, aged 85, in Warsaw, Poland.

== Works ==
Å»ywny wrote many pieces for piano, and violin, as well as orchestral works, few of which are known or published today. They show refined mastery of the classical style, with definite romantic influences. Another influence on his music was Central European folk music.

<text>Tone Float is the only album by the German band Organisation zur Verwirklichung gemeinsamer Musikkonzepte (Organisation). Organisation is best remembered for having the two founders of Kraftwerk as members, Ralf HÃ¼tter and Florian Schneider-Esleben, which they did after the album&#x27;s release and band&#x27;s disbandment.

==Recording and release==
The album was produced by Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank. Of the album&#x27;s recording, HÃ¼tter would later say:

Sales were poor and RCA opted to drop the band, which then dissolved following the departure of HÃ¼tter and Schneider-Esleben to Kraftwerk.

The album has never been officially reissued, although bootleg CDs, LPs and cassettes appeared since the 1990s. These often included a bonus audio-track, erroneously titled &quot;Vor dem blauen Bock&quot;, which in fact is an instrumental track named &quot;RÃ¼ckstoÃ Gondoliere&quot;, from a 22 May 1971 performance by Kraftwerk on the Bremen &quot;Beat-Club&quot; TV show. This song features the short-lived line-up of Florian Schneider, Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger (Ralf HÃ¼tter had left the group during this period to study architecture). Rother and Dinger left Kraftwerk shortly afterwards to form Neu!.

In 2021, the album was unofficially rereleased on digital services under the name &quot;Tone Float Beat-Club 1971,&quot; along with a new album cover by record label Media Champ. This release additionally includes, and correctly names, &quot;RÃ¼ckstoÃ Gondoliere.&quot;

<text>Gideon Brand van Zyl, PC (; 3 June 18731 November 1956) was Governor-General of the Union of South Africa from 1945 to 1950.

Born in Cape Town, he was the son of a prominent attorney, and he joined the family firm after qualifying at the University of Cape Town. During the Anglo-Boer War (1899â1902), he was a legal adviser to the British War Office.

In World War I (1914â1918), he was Deputy Director of War Recruiting, and served in the Cape Peninsula Garrison Regiment (a home defence unit).

He was a member of the Cape Provincial Council (the provincial legislature) until 1918, and then a member of Parliament until 1942. He was Deputy Speaker from 1934 to 1942 (the Speaker being Dr Ernest George Jansen, who was later also governor-general).

From 1942 to 1945, Van Zyl was Administrator of the Cape Province. He served as Governor-General from 1945 until 1950. He was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1945. In 1947, he hosted King George VI and the British Royal Family when they toured South Africa.

<doc id="556860" wikidata="Q1024921" url="?curid=556860" title="Boe, Guinea-Bissau">
<text>Boe (full name Madina do Boe) is a settlement in the southeastern GabÃº Region of Guinea-Bissau. The population is mostly of poor Fulani speaking herders. Although geologically rich in bauxite, the mineral deposits have not been exploited to any great degree due to the ecological sensitivity of the surrounding BoÃ© National Park.

==History==
The Boe area was pivotal during the war of independence that would eventually end the colonial regime in Portuguese Guinea. On 6 February 1969, rebel forces ousted the colonial garrison (known as the Companhia de CaÃ§adores 1790) from Boe. The men retreated north and needed to cross the Corubal River 22Â km away. There, in what became known as the Cheche Disaster, 47 Portuguese soldiers and five of the local Boe garrison were killed when one of the overloaded river-rafts capsized.

Boe was the site where the 2nd Congress of the PAIGC was held in July 1973 and where independence was declared on September 24, 1973. Boe itself briefly served as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital until Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s independence was finally recognised in 1974, following the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon. Thereafter, Bissau was declared the national capital of the newly independent country and Boe returned to relative obscurity.

<doc id="556868" wikidata="Q4189548" url="?curid=556868" title="Arseny Zverev">
<text>Arseny Grigoryevich Zverev (; 2 March 1900 â 27 July 1969) was a Soviet and Russian politician, economist and statesman whose career spanned the rules of Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev, but culminated during the Stalin years. Zverev was born in a little village just outside Moscow. After years in local politics, he rose to prominence as a Deputy Commissar of Finance, but he also held other lesser posts such as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

As Deputy Commissar of Finance he was able to work up, and eventually get promoted to People&#x27;s Commissar for Finance (renamed to Ministry in 1946). Later, Zverev gained a seat in both the Central Committee and the Presidium. During the Great Patriotic War he was responsible for providing funds for the Soviet military machine to fight the Germans. After the war he lost his Ministership, but was again made Minister of Finance late in 1948. He was replaced as Minister of Finance by Vasily Garbuzov in 1960. Zverev then held the office of Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for four convocations. He died in July 1969.

==Early life and career==
Zverev was born in Tikhomirovo Klin, Klinsky Uyezd, Moscow Oblast to a working-class family. Before attending university, Zverev worked from 1913 to 1919 at two factories, the first being Vysokovsky manufactory located in Moscow Oblast and Trekhgorny factory in the city of Moscow. By 1919 he had joined both the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP(b)) and the Red Army to fight in the Russian Civil War. He became a platoon commander over a cavalry regiment before the demobilization of the army in 1922. In 1922, he became the head of the local Agitation and Propaganda Department, and two years later, an agent of the provincial Financial Department of Moscow. He did however continue his work as an industrial worker for a short-period of time, before leaving for good. In 1927 he became Chairman of the Executive Committee of Klin, and later in 1929, Head of Tax Administration of the Financial Department of Smolensk Oblast. The following year he also became the Head of the Financial Department of Bryansk Oblast. From 1931 to 1932 he attended the Moscow Institute of Finance and Economics and from 1936 to 1937 a District Council Chairman in Moscow. In 1937 he became the First Secretary of the Molotov District Committee of the RCP(b) of Moscow. Zverev graduated and got his degree from the Moscow Institute of Finance in 1949.

==Minister of Finance (1938â1960)==
Due to mass arrests perpetrated by the Soviet state in the 1930s, known as the Great Purge, Zverev along with many others were quickly promoted to the top of Soviet bureaucracy. He was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1950 and again from 1954 to 1962. In the meantime he held a range of offices in government, the first being the position of Deputy Commissar for Finance in September 1937 but was again quickly promoted, this time to the office of the People&#x27;s Commissar for Finance, the head of Soviet finance. Zverev was given a seat in the Central Committee in 1939. During the Great Patriotic War, Zverev was responsible for providing the necessary funds for the Soviet military for the production of new equipment. During the war, the price for goods also increased. In 1948, from February to December that same year, he was downgraded to Deputy Minister of Finance. He got his old office back in December 1948 and in October 1952 became a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee. He lost his seat following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953.

==Later years and death==
Following his departure from the office of Minister of Finance, he became Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on 1-2 and 4-5 convocations before leaving politics for good. In 1961 he became a Professor of the All-Union Correspondence of Financial Institution. Zverev died in Moscow on 27 July 1969. He was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>The Gaelic revival () was the late-nineteenth-century national revival of interest in the Irish language (also known as Gaelic) and Irish Gaelic culture (including folklore, mythology, sports, music, arts, etc.). Irish had diminished as a spoken tongue, remaining the main daily language only in isolated rural areas, with English having become the dominant language in the majority of Ireland.

Interest in Gaelic culture was evident early in the nineteenth century with the formation of the Belfast Harp Society in 1808 and the Ulster Gaelic Society in 1830, and later in the scholarly works of Robert Shipboy MacAdam, John O&#x27;Donovan and Eugene O&#x27;Curry, and the foundation of the Ossianic Society. Concern for spoken Irish led to the formation of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language in 1876, and the Gaelic Union in 1880. The latter produced the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot;. Irish traditional sports were fostered by the Gaelic Athletic Association, founded in 1884.

The Gaelic League () was established in 1893 by Eoin MacNeill and other enthusiasts of Gaelic language and culture. Its first president was Douglas Hyde. The objective of the league was to encourage the use of Irish in everyday life in order to counter the ongoing anglicisation of the country. It organised weekly gatherings to discuss Irish culture, hosted conversation meetings, edited and periodically published a newspaper named , and successfully campaigned to have Irish included in the school curriculum. The league grew quickly, having more than 48 branches within four years of its foundation and 400 within 10. It had fraught relationships with other cultural movements of the time, such as the Pan-Celtic movement and the Irish Literary Revival.

Important writers of the Gaelic revival include , Patrick Pearse () and .

==Early movements==
===The Belfast &quot;renaissance&quot;===
The Belfast &quot;renaissance of Irish music&quot;, that saw the staging of the Belfast Harpers Assembly in July 1792, has been seen as &quot;the precursor by a century of the Irish Gaelic Revival&quot;, and to have been &quot;the beginning of a long association between northern Protestants&quot; and the struggle to preserve and advance the Irish language&quot;. In 1795, with the aim of preventing &quot;the total neglect and to diffuse the beauties of this ancient and much-acclaimed language&quot;, the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, the newspaper of the United Irishmen, produced the Irish-language grammar, dictionary and anthology, &quot;Bolg an tSolair.&quot; In the same year, the &quot;Star&quot; advertised classes in the language offered by PÃ¡draig Ã Loingsigh (Patrick Lynch) at the Belfast Academy.

In 1808, one the harp festival&#x27;s principal organisers, the physician and polymath, James MacDonnell established the Belfast Harp Society. In addition to &quot;preserving the national music and national instrument of Ireland&quot;, it sought to procure and disseminate &quot;information relative to the language, history and antiquities of Ireland&quot;.

With an additional subscription from MacDonnell, and with the enthusiastic support of Mary Ann McCracken (who is known to have studied from Charles Vallency&#x27;s Irish grammar), and her Gaeilgeoir friend, the poetess Mary Balfour of Limavady, the Society organised Irish language classes. These were provided by James Cody. who used &quot;An Introduction to the Irish Language&quot; (1808) compiled by the Presbyterian minister William Neilson (Uilliam Mac NÃ©ill).

From 1828/30, MacDonnell resumed this work as chairman of &quot;Cuideacht Gaoidhilge Uladh&quot; (the Ulster Gaelic Society). The society focussed on the contemporary Irish vernacular, rather than in the classical language of manuscripts, but abjured the religious evangelism that persuaded other Protestants to pursue a similar interest. With TomÃ¡s Ã Fiannachta, Robert Shipboy MacAdam, joint secretary of the society, published &quot;An introduction to the Irish language intended for the use of Irish classes in the Royal Belfast Academical Institution&quot; &quot;â&quot; a grammar for the school founded on progressive principles by William Drennan and other United Irish veterans.

After the Ulster Gaelic Society ceased to operate in 1843, MacAdam employed the poet Aodh Mac Domhnaill (Hugh McDonnell) as a full-time scribe and collector of songs, folklore, and Irish-language manuscripts. MacAdam himself collected extensively, sometimes finding his material among Irish-speaking immigrants to Belfast.

===Dublin societies===
Early pioneers of more rigorous Irish scholarship were John O&#x27;Donovan (who was to become professor of Celtic Languages at Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast), Eugene O&#x27;Curry and George Petrie. O&#x27;Donovan and O&#x27;Curry found an important outlet for their work in the Irish Archaeological Society, one of the first text publication societies of Ireland, founded in 1840. In 1854 it merged with the Celtic Society, to form the Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society.

From 1853, translations of Irish literary works, particularly mythological works of the Ossianic Cycleâassociated with the Fiannaâwere published by the Ossianic Society, in which Standish Hayes O&#x27;Grady was active. The Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language was formed in 1877 by, among others, George Sigerson and Thomas O&#x27;Neill Russell. The secretary of that society, Father John Nolan, split with it in 1880 and formed the Gaelic Union, of which the president was The O&#x27;Conor Don, and whose members included Douglas Hyde and Michael Cusack. Cusack&#x27;s interest in Gaelic culture was not restricted to the language; he took a keen interest in the traditional games of Ireland, and in 1884, with Maurice Davin, he would found the Gaelic Athletic Association to promote the games of Gaelic football, hurling and handball. In 1882 the Gaelic Union began publication of a monthly journal, the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot;. Its first editor was David Comyn; he was followed by John Fleming, a prominent Irish scholar, and then Father Eugene O&#x27;Growney.

==Gaelic League==
In November 1892 Douglas Hyde gave a lecture to the National Literary Society entitled &quot;The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland.&quot; He said that the Irish people had become almost completely anglicised, and that this could only be reversed through building up the language. Eoin MacNeill followed this up with an article in the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot;, &quot;A Plea and a Plan for the Extension of the Movement to Preserve and Spread the Gaelic language in Ireland&quot;, and set about forming an organisation to help bring this about, together with Eugene O&#x27;Growney and J. H. Lloyd (). The Gaelic League () was founded on 31 July 1893. Hyde was elected president, MacNeill secretary, and Lloyd treasurer, and Thomas O&#x27;Neill Russell was among those elected to the council.

The Gaelic League held weekly meetings that were a combination of classes and conversation. Its focus on the vernacular form of language and modern literature distinguished it from the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language, The Celtic Society and the Gaelic Union. Within months it had branches in Cork and Galway. After four years it had 43 branches, and after ten years more than 400. Although it was more concerned with fostering the language in the home than with teaching it in schools, it was nonetheless successful in having Irish added to the curriculum; the number of schools teaching it rose from about a dozen in the 1880s to 1,300 in 1903. The League took over the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot; in 1894, when O&#x27;Growney retired as editor, with MacNeill replacing him. In January 1898 it began publication of a weekly newspaper, . In March of the following year, following a dispute with the owner, this was replaced by , with MacNeill again as editor. In 1901 MacNeill was replaced as editor by Eoghan Ã Neachtain, who was in turn replaced in 1903 by Patrick Pearse. The League also concerned itself with the folk music of Ireland, and was involved in the movement which led to the organisation of the Feis Ceoil (Festival of Music) by Annie Patterson in 1897.

The League&#x27;s relations with contemporary cultural movements were strained, and sometimes hostile, despite the fact that some of the League&#x27;s leaders were on friendly terms with those movements. Pan-Celticism was viewed with suspicion by many members because its leaders in Ireland, especially Lord Castletown, were closely associated with the Irish establishment. When Douglas Hyde was invited to the planned Pan-Celtic Congress of 1900âto be held in Dublinâas a delegate of the League, the (executive committee) refused to send any representative, though Hyde might attend as an individual if he wished. Hyde reluctantly declined to attend. The Irish Literary Revival was denounced because its works were written in English, not Irish, and therefore tended even more towards anglicisation. Eoin MacNeill wrote, &quot;Let them write for the &#x27;English-speaking world&#x27; or the &#x27;English-speaking race&#x27; if they will. But let them not vex our ears by calling their writings Irish and national.&quot; Patrick Pearse said of the Irish Literary Theatre, recently founded by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, that it should be &quot;strangled at birth&quot;.

==Writers==
 (Father Peter O&#x27;Leary), a parish priest from Castlelyons in County Cork, began contributing to the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot; in 1894, and in November of that year he published the first instalment of , which was to become his best-known work. It was described by the journal as a &quot;specimen of Munster Irish, one of the best samples, if not the very best, of southern popular Gaelic that has ever been printed.&quot; was the first major work of modern literature in Irish. serialised the in the &quot;Cork Weekly Examiner&quot; in 1900â1901, and followed it up with a series of modern renderings of ancient Irish tales such as , , and , all of which eschewed scholarship in favour of colloquial, entertaining Irish. After , his best-known work is his autobiography, . All his works are written in what was called (the language of the people).

Patrick Pearse (), the editor of âand later a revolutionary leader in the Easter Risingâwrote poetry, short stories and plays. He is considered the first modernist writer in Irish. Pearse rejected what he called the imposition of &quot;dead linguistic and literary forms on a living language&quot;, but at the same time rejected the idea that only native speakers like could produce &quot;Irish Irish&quot;. He produced two books of short stories, (1907) and (1916). His collection of poems, (1914) contains his most famous poem, &quot;&quot; (&quot;I am Ireland&quot;).

 is sometimes considered to be the best writer of the period. He wrote more than 400 short stories between 1901 and his death in 1928. His stories were darker than those of his contemporaries. According to his entry in the &quot;Dictionary of Irish Biography&quot;, they deal with &quot;isolation, conflict between good and evil, the tragedy of life, hatred, blindness, despair, and madness.&quot; He wrote one novel, (Exile), described by John T. Koch as a &quot;strange and brooding psychological novel, the first of the genre in Irish&quot;, about a Connemara man living in London. &#x27;s works were controversial, addressing themes such as alcoholism and prostitution, which and others within the movement found objectionable.

<doc id="556874" wikidata="Q1328946" url="?curid=556874" title="Eliakum Zunser">
<text>Eliakum Zunser (Eliakim Badchen, Elikum Tsunzer) (October 28, 1840 â September 22, 1913) was a Lithuanian Jewish Yiddish-language poet, songwriter, and &quot;badchen&quot; who lived out the last part of his life in the U.S. A 1905 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded him as &quot;the father of Yiddish poetry&quot;. About a quarter of his roughly 600 songs survive. He influenced and was influenced by Brody singer Velvel Zbarzher, although it is not believed that they ever met.

Born in Vilna, he grew up poor and first worked braiding lace in Kovno, where he was associated with the devout, moralistic Musar movement of Rabbi Israel Salanter. Later, he was drawn to the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, and adopted a more modern Orthodox Judaism that renounced superstition.

Forcibly conscripted into the Russian Army just before his twentieth birthday, he was soon released due to Czar Alexander II&#x27;s revocation of the harsh conscription law. The plight of Jewish draftees, or &quot;cantonists&quot; would be a major subject of his early poetry and songs.

Sol Liptzin describes Zunser&#x27;s songs as having &quot;simple words and catchy tunes&quot;, singing of the &quot;melancholy fate and few joys of the inarticulate masses&quot; and writes that &quot;his songs spread by word of mouth... until all Yiddish-speaking Jews were familiar with them&quot;. [Liptzin, 1972, 48]

In 1861 he published a booklet of songs entitled &quot;Shirim Khadoshim&quot;, the first of about 50 publications in his lifetime. At this time, he was, in Liptzin&#x27;s words, &quot;primarily a Maskil&quot;âa propagator of the Haskalahâ&quot;interested in instructing and aiding his people&quot;. However, his life took a tragic turn: not only did his wife die of cholera in the next decade, but all of their nine children as well, and he became, again quoting Liptzin, &quot;a prophet of doom, admonishing his co-religionists not to venture too date along the alluring road of western enlightenment and assimilation...&quot; [Liptzin, 1972, 49] When that doom came, in the form of the anti-Semitic reaction and pogrom after the assassination of Alexander II, he became again a comforter, as well as a Zionist, affiliated with the Hovevei Zion and Bilu pioneers, writing songs such as &quot;Die Sokhe&quot; (&quot;The Plough&quot;) and &quot;Shivath Zion&quot; (&quot;Homecoming to Zion&quot;).

Zunser emigrated to New York City in 1889, and worked as a printer. However, life in New York was not conducive to his muse, and he wrote little in the years after his arrival in America, mostly poems rather than songs. &quot;En route&quot; to the New World, he wrote the hopeful &quot;Columbus and Washington&quot;; once there, he followed this with the far more disillusioned &quot;Dos Goldene Land&quot; (&quot;The Golden Land&quot;) and &quot;Der Greener&quot; (&quot;The Greenhorn&quot;). His Zionism continued in a song urging the Jewish people to give up peddling and become farmers.

Zunser was saved from penury in his final years by a benefit performance on his behalf held at Cooper Union on March 30, 1905, which raised enough money to give him a pension. He died on September 22, 1913, and was buried in Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn.

<text>Richard Adolf Zsigmondy (; 1 April 1865 â 23 September 1929) was an Austrian-born chemist. He was known for his research in colloids, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1925, as well as for co-inventing the slit-ultramicroscope, and different membrane filters. The crater Zsigmondy on the Moon is named in his honour.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Zsigmondy was born in Vienna, Austrian Empire, to a Hungarian gentry family. His mother Irma SzakmÃ¡ry, a poet born in MartonvÃ¡sÃ¡r, and his father, Adolf Zsigmondy Sr., a scientist from Pressburg (Pozsony, today&#x27;s Bratislava) who invented several surgical instruments for use in dentistry. Zsigmondy family members were Lutherans. They originated from Johannes () Sigmondi (1686â1746, BÃ¡rtfa, Kingdom of Hungary) and included teachers, priests and Hungarian freedom-fighters. Richard was raised by his mother after his father&#x27;s early death in 1880, and received a comprehensive education. He enjoyed hobbies such as climbing and mountaineering with his siblings. His elder brothers, Otto (a dentist) and Emil (a physician), were well-known mountain climbers; his younger brother, Karl Zsigmondy, became a notable mathematician in Vienna. In high school, Richard developed an interest in natural science, especially in chemistry and physics, and experimented in his home laboratory.

He began his academic career at the University of Vienna Medical Faculty, but soon moved to the Technical University of Vienna, and later to the University of Munich, to study chemistry under Wilhelm von Miller (1848â1899). In Munich, he conducted research on indene and received his PhD from the University of Erlangen in 1889.

===Career===
In 1885 Zsigmondy published his very first article as a joint publication with his Viennese professor Rudolf Benedikt on a method of determining glycerin. His 1887 article &quot;Neue LÃ¼ster und Farben auf Glas&quot; (about colours on glass) marked the beginning of a research area on which he would work for another 30 years. Zsigmondy left organic chemistry to join the physics group of August Kundt at the University of Berlin.

In July 1892 Zsigmondy held a colloquium at Graz University of Technology assessed among others by Albert von Ettingshausen and Friedrich Emich in order to qualify as assistant professor. There he also completed his habilitation in 1893. Because of his knowledge about glass and its colouring, in 1897 the Schott Glass factory offered him a job which he accepted. He invented the Jenaer Milchglas and conducted some research on the red Ruby glass. Lecturing activities in Graz were documented until 1899.

Zsigmondy left Schott Glass in 1900, but remained in Jena as private lecturer to conduct his research. Together with the optical instrument manufacturer Zeiss, he developed the slit ultramicroscope. His scientific career continued in 1908 at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, where he stayed for the rest of his professional career as professor of inorganic chemistry. In 1925, Zsigmondy received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on colloids and the methods he used, such as the ultramicroscope upon which based his investigation on the Purple of Cassius.

Before Zsigmondy finished his PhD thesis in organic chemistry, he published research on colouring glass with silver salts and dissolved silver particles, which he recovered by dissolving the glass in hydrofluoric acid.

During his stay in Graz, Zsigmondy accomplished his most notable research work, on the chemistry of colloids. The exact mechanism which yields the red colour of the Cranberry or Ruby glass was a result of his studies of colloids.

In later years he worked on gold hydrosols and used them to characterize protein solutions. While in Jena, he developed the slit ultramicroscope together with Henry Siedentopf. After moving to GÃ¶ttingen, Zsigmondy improved his optical equipment for the observation of finest nanoparticles suspended in liquid solution. As a result, he introduced the immersion ultramicroscope in 1912.

Together with Wilhelm Bachmann, Zsigmondy developed a new membrane filter (1916). He later transferred his patents to a company established by him, other shareholders and Sartorius AG which was incorporated to Sartorius in the late 1970s.

===Private life===
In 1903 Zsigmondy married Laura Luise MÃ¼ller, with whom he had two daughters, Annemarie and KÃ¤the.

Richard Zsigmondy died due to his arteriosclerosis only a few months after retiring from his university position in GÃ¶ttingen in early March.

He was a cousin of the architect Frigyes Schulek, whose mother was Auguszta Zsigmondy. He is also related to the violinist DÃ©nes Zsigmondy.

<doc id="556894" wikidata="Q3617" url="?curid=556894" title="Karlovac">
<text>Karlovac () is a city in central Croatia. In the 2021 census, its population was 49,377.

Karlovac is the administrative centre of Karlovac County. The city is located southwest of Zagreb and northeast of Rijeka, and is connected to them via the A1 highway and the M202 railway.

==Name==
The city was named after its founder, Charles II, Archduke of Austria. The German name &quot;Karlstadt&quot; or &quot;Carlstadt&quot; (&quot;Charlestown&quot;) has the equivalence in various languages: in Hungarian it is known as &quot;KÃ¡rolyvÃ¡ros&quot;, in Italian as &quot;Carlovizza&quot;, in Latin as &quot;Carolostadium&quot;, and in Kajkavian dialect and Slovene as Karlovec.

==History==
The Austrians built Karlovac from scratch in 1579 in order to strengthen their southern defences against Ottoman encroachments. The establishment of a new city-fortress was a part of the deal between the Protestant nobility of Inner Austria and the archduke Charles II of Austria. In exchange for their religious freedom the nobility agreed to finance the building of a new fortress against the Ottoman Empire. It was founded as a six-pointed star fortress built on the Zrinski estate near the old town of Dubovac at the confluence of the Kupa and Korana rivers. As the city later expanded, the urban area reached as far as the MreÅ¾nica and Dobra rivers. The star shape can still be seen around the town. It was originally known as Karlstadt (&quot;Charles&#x27;s Town&quot; in German), after the ruling family, upon whose orders construction began on 13 July 1579. The architect of the city was Matija Gambon, whilst work on the new fortress was supervised by George KhevenhÃ¼ller. It was intentionally built on terrain exposed to flooding and disease from unhealthy water, with the intent to hamper the Turkish advance.

The fortress itself was largely complete by September 1580, while moats and ramparts were finished later, between 1582 and 1589. The first church (of the Holy Trinity) was built in the central square in 1580, but all of the city buildings burned down in the fire of 1594. By 1610, moats and ramparts were repaired, and houses were rebuilt.
As a military outpost of the Habsburg monarchy, Karlovac was one of the first headquarters of the general command of the Military Frontier. It was the site of the trial and execution of the best-known leader of the rebel Uskoks from the coastal fort of Senj, Ivan VlatkoviÄ. He was executed in Karlovac on 3 July 1612 as an example to his troops who were creating difficulties for the Habsburgs by their piracy against Venetian shipping on the Adriatic Sea, and by marauding raids into the Ottoman hinterland. In 1615 their piracy went so far as creating an open war between Venice and Austria. When the Treaty of Paris (ratified in Madrid) was concluded in 1617, bringing an end to the war between Venice and the Habsburgs, under the terms of the treaty the Uskok families were forcibly removed from Senj and disbanded into the hinterland, most notably in the Å½umberak hills north of Karlovac.

The forces of the Ottoman Empire laid siege to Karlovac seven times, the last time in 1672, but failed to occupy it. The plague epidemic of 1773 also afflicted the city, killing almost half the population of the time.

Meanwhile, the fort was becoming too crowded for the city&#x27;s expanding population and the Military Frontier government could not allow for its further growth. On 6 December 1693 the city received some limited self-government.

After the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) and the Ottomans withdrawal, Karlstadt was of less military significance. By the end of the 18th century, the town was a major marketplace for wheat, corn, salt, timber and tobacco, and the source of supply for the Austrian army in Austro-Turkish Wars.

Queen Maria Theresa, after long insistence from the Croatian Diet, restored the towns of Karlovac and Rijeka (Fiume) to the Croatian crownland on 9 August 1776. Maria Theresa was also responsible for the founding of Gymnasium Karlovac, and later King Joseph II reaffirmed it as a free town with an official charter in 1781. This allowed the citizens to expand the city and exploit the potential of being at the crossroads of paths from the Pannonian plains to the Adriatic coast. The town blossomed in the 18th and 19th centuries with the development of roads to the seaside and waterways along the Kupa River. The construction of the Zidani Most-Zagreb-Sisak railway line in 1861, however, marked the end of the era of Karlovac as a major trade and transport center.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Karlovac was a district capital in the Zagreb County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
===20th century===
In 1990, City Council proclaimed Saint Joseph as city&#x27;s patron saint. Karlovac suffered damage during the Croatian War of Independence (1991â1995). The southern sections of the city found themselves close to the front lines between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Serbian Krajina, with shelling devastating the neighborhoods of Turanj, Kamensko, as well as parts of MekuÅ¡je, Mala Å varÄa and LogoriÅ¡te. The city center, the city hall, and numerous other buildings also suffered damage. It was also the site of the Korana bridge killings.

The Karlovac City Museum has transformed the old Austrian military barracks of Turanj into a museum exhibition dedicated to the military history of Karlovac and in particular, through the exhibited weapons, of the Croatian War of Independence.
Until the early 2000s, Karlovac&#x27;s main industry consisted of brewing the beer &quot;KarlovaÄko&quot;, produced by KarlovaÄka pivovara. By 2007, the rapidly growing firearms manufacturer HS Produkt had become the city&#x27;s largest private employer. HS Produkt is arguably best known as the designer and manufacturer of the HS2000 pistol, sold in the United States as the Springfield Armory XD.

On 22 October 2016 Croatia&#x27;s first freshwater aquarium, and the biggest in that part of Europe, named &quot;Aquatika&quot; was opened in Karlovac.

==Description==
Croatians know Karlovac as &quot;grad parkova&quot; (the city of parks) and &quot;grad na Äetiri rijeke&quot; (the town on four rivers) for its numerous green areas and four rivers, of which MreÅ¾nica, Korana, and Kupa flow through built-up areas, and Dobra is a few kilometers outside the city centre. A documentary film made by DuÅ¡an VukotiÄ in 1979 on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the founding of the city plays much on that theme, and shows pictures of happy bathers on the Korana&#x27;s Fogina beach (Foginovo kupaliÅ¡te) in the city centre.

One of the rarer trees found in the parks is the &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, which local primary school children are taken out to see as part of their classes on nature and society. Most of the parks are planted in the former trenches dug around the old military fort that were once filled with water as an added layer of protection from the marauding Ottoman armies. One part of the city centre maintains the name of Å anac (&#x27;trench&#x27;) after the old trenches which preserve the old hexagonal form of the historic centre.

Much of the population of Karlovac has changed since the beginning of the 1991â95 Croatian War of Independence, with numerous families of Croatian Serbs fleeing and being replaced by people who were themselves displaced from parts of Croatia that were held by rebel Serbs during the war (such as from the town of Slunj), as well as by families of Bosnian Croats who started arriving during the war. The migration outflow was mostly towards Serbia, the Republika Srpska entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to countries of Western Europe, North America and Australia.

<doc id="556900" wikidata="Q2171193" url="?curid=556900" title="Royal Yacht Squadron">
<text>The Royal Yacht Squadron (RYS) is a British yacht club. Its clubhouse is Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. Member yachts are given the suffix RYS to their names, and are permitted (with the appropriate warrant) to wear the White Ensign of the Royal Navy rather than the merchant Red Ensign worn by the majority of other UK registered vessels. The club&#x27;s patron was Queen Elizabeth II.

The Royal Yacht Squadron entered the 2021 America&#x27;s Cup in Auckland, New Zealand, with the Ineos Team UK syndicate led by Sir Ben Ainslie, but did not win. In March 2021, an entity associated with the RYS, called Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd, was officially accepted as the Challenger of Record for the 37th America&#x27;s Cup competition.

==History==
Founded on 1 June 1815 in the Thatched House Tavern in St James&#x27;s, London as The Yacht Club by 42 gentlemen interested in sea yachting, the original members decided to meet in London and in Cowes twice a year, to discuss yachting over dinner.Membership was restricted to those who owned a vessel not under 10 tons. 

The Earl of Yarborough, later first commodore of the club, welcomed the Prince Regent as a member in 1817. In 1820, when the Prince Regent became George IV, it was renamed the Royal Yacht Club.

The club started organising racing as a principal feature of the annual regatta, which is now known as Cowes Week. In 1833, William IV renamed the club The Royal Yacht Squadron.
Its association with the Royal Navy began early and Nelson&#x27;s captain at Trafalgar, Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, headed the list of naval members. The spirit of invention led to yachts &quot;of such celerity in sailing and beauty of construction&quot; that they were of utility to the Royal Navy.
In 1829, the Admiralty issued a warrant to wear what is now the navy&#x27;s White Ensign. The burgee (a triangular shaped flag identifying yacht club membership) is differenced with a St George&#x27;s Cross and crown on a white background.

In 1851, one of the &quot;forred&quot; hands, on board the yacht &quot;America&quot; concerning the first sailing of the America&#x27;s Cup, 1851 wrote &#x27;The Royal Yacht ClubâIn a fix&#x27; (tune). &quot;Come listen to my ditty, and a song to you I&#x27;ll sing...&quot;

Another naval connection is that the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. To enable the application of naval discipline on board a civilian ship, he registered the &quot;Terra Nova RYS&quot; as a yacht of the squadron and sailed under the White Ensign on his second and final expedition to Antarctica in 1910.

In August 2013, the members of Royal Yacht Squadron voted to allow full membership to women, which had been restricted since its foundation.

==Racing==

In 1851, the club&#x27;s commodore, visiting the Great Exhibition, issued a challenge for the squadron&#x27;s Â£100 Cup for a race around the island. The New York Cityâbased &quot;America&quot;, representing the New York Yacht Club, triumphed in this race, giving its name to one of the oldest and best-known trophies: the America&#x27;s Cup. The victory was witnessed by Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, later commodore of the club and Edward VII.

The site is also used as the start of the Round the Island Race which occurs annually.

During the American Civil War &quot;Deerhound RYS&quot; witnessed the fight between USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and the Confederate cruiser CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;. &quot;Gazelle RYS&quot; rescued the Empress Eugenie at the end of the Franco-Prussian War and the squadron yachts supplied British soldiers in the Crimean War.

The German Kaiser brought the 1887 America&#x27;s Cup challenger &quot;Thistle&quot; to Cowes in 1892, which encouraged the Prince of Wales to build the royal cutter yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;, one of the most successful racing yachts of all time.

==The Pavilion==

The Pavilion, designed by the architect Thomas Croft, was opened in 2000. This building provides on shore facilities for yachtsmen and their families while allowing the castle to retain its &#x27;country house&#x27; ambience.

<doc id="556903" wikidata="Q216928" url="?curid=556903" title="Andy Cole">
<text>Andrew Alexander Cole (born 15 October 1971) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. His professional career lasted from 1988 to 2008, and is mostly remembered for his time with Manchester United, who paid a British record transfer fee to sign him from Newcastle United. Cole spent six years with Manchester United and won nine trophies, including five Premier League titles and the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999.

As well as Manchester United and Newcastle United, Cole also played in the top division of English football for Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Fulham, Manchester City, Portsmouth and Sunderland, as well as in The Football League for Bristol City, Birmingham City, Burnley and Nottingham Forest. He is the fourth-highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 187 goals, and used to hold the Premier League records for most goals scored in a 42-game season (34), the fastest player to score 50 goals (65 matches), and the first player to top both the Premier League&#x27;s goalscoring and assist charts in the same season (1993â94).

Cole has the distinction of having won every top-level team competition in English football at least once, as well as the primary European competition, the UEFA Champions League. As an individual he has won the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Cole was capped 15 times for the England national team between 1995 and 2001, scoring once against Albania in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Cole began his career as a youth player for Arsenal on leaving school in 1988, signing professional in 1989. He made his only league appearance for Arsenal, aged 19, as a substitute against Sheffield United at Highbury during a First Division match on 29 December 1990. Arsenal won 4â1 but Cole did not score. He also made a substitute appearance against Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield in 1991 and almost made an immediate impact, hitting the side netting from outside the penalty area. The following season, Cole was loaned to Fulham in the Third Division, where he scored three goals in 13 matches.

Cole joined Second Division Bristol City on loan in March 1992 before signing in a Â£500,000 permanent deal in the summer of 1992, at the time becoming their most expensive player. Having proved himself as a competent young goalscorer with Bristol City (who began the 1992â93 season in the new Football League Division One following the creation of the Premier League), Cole was quickly one of the hottest prospects in England and his name was frequently linked with Premier League clubs throughout the 1992â93 season.

===Newcastle United===
In February 1993, Division One leaders Newcastle United broke their club transfer record by paying Â£1.75Â million to sign Cole. He then scored 12 goals in as many league matches as Newcastle cruised to the Division One title and won promotion to the Premier League. His 12 goals included two hat-tricks, the first against Barnsley on 7 April, the second on the final day of the season in a 7â1 hammering of Leicester City. He also scored the first of the club&#x27;s two goals in their 2â0 promotion clinching win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 4 May.

After David Kelly was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers, manager Kevin Keegan brought in Peter Beardsley as Cole&#x27;s strike partner for the 1993â94 Premier League campaign.

Cole scored 34 goals in 40 matches during Newcastle&#x27;s first Premier League season as they finished third, and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time since the 1970s. His first top division goal was in a 1â1 draw against defending league champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on 21 August 1993. This was Newcastle&#x27;s first goal in the Premier League. Exactly three months later, Cole scored all three goals as Newcastle defeated Liverpool 3â0 at home. Another emphatic hat-trick followed against Coventry City in late February and with Peter Beardsley almost as lethal as his strike partner. Cole scored 41 total goals in all competitions â breaking the club&#x27;s goalscoring record which had been set by Hughie Gallacher nearly 70 years earlier (Gallacher still holds the record for the highest number of league goals in a season with 36). Cole scored in 26 different Premier League appearances for Newcastle in 1993â94, which is a season record in the competition by a player.

Cole was subsequently voted PFA Young Player of the Year for that season.

Cole then scored 9 goals in 18 Premier League matches for Newcastle after the start of the 1994â95 season, and also scored a hat-trick against Royal Antwerp in the UEFA Cup.

In all, Cole scored 68 goals in 84 matches for Newcastle, giving him a strike rate of 81%. Cole&#x27;s last goal for Newcastle United came in the 1â1 home draw with Ipswich Town on 26 November 1994.

===Manchester United===
On 10 January 1995, Cole was suddenly sold in a shock deal to Manchester United for a deal worth Â£7Â million â Â£6Â million cash plus Â£1Â million-rated Keith Gillespie going in the opposite direction, setting a new record for the most expensive British transfer. Newcastle fans were saddened and confused with Keegan for selling Cole, leading to Keegan publicly confronting fans at St James&#x27; Park, against the advice of chairman Sir John Hall and first team coach Terry McDermott, explaining his reasons on the day of the transfer. Cole stated his sadness at leaving the club, however felt the iconic status Newcastle fans aligned with him was premature and affecting him personally, while he cited Newcastle&#x27;s November loss to Wimbledon as permanently damaging his relationship with Keegan. McDermott stated in his autobiography that Keegan decided to sell Cole citing a drop in form and enthusiasm, while also hoping to sign Queens Park Rangers striker Les Ferdinand shortly following Cole&#x27;s departure. Ferdinand signed for Newcastle that summer.

Despite joining halfway through the 1994â95 season, Cole still managed to score 12 goals in just 18 Premier League matches for United. This included his first, the winner in a 1â0 victory over Aston Villa on 4 February at Old Trafford and five in the 9â0 rout of Ipswich Town, making him the first player to score five goals in a Premier League match. He also scored twice in away wins over Leicester City and Coventry City during the season&#x27;s final stages, as his new team kept up the pressure and cut the gap between themselves and league leaders Blackburn Rovers.

However, Cole missed two goal chances in the final minutes against West Ham United on the final day of the season as they could only manage a 1â1 draw and the league title went to Blackburn Rovers instead. He was cup-tied for the FA Cup Final a week later. Without him, United lost to Everton 1â0. United were also without the banned Eric Cantona and the injured Andrei Kanchelskis, the club&#x27;s two other highest scoring players that season.

Cole&#x27;s first full season in 1995â96 with Manchester United proved to be difficult, as Cole struggled to find his trademark form in a side now built around the much heralded return of Eric Cantona. Though Cole scored in four consecutive matches halfway through the season, including an important opening goal in United&#x27;s 2â0 defeat of title rivals Newcastle United on 27 December, Cole was badgered by fans and critics alike across much of the season for only scoring 14 times and missing many chances. However, Cole picked up his form in the final stages of the season and scored crucial goals including the equaliser in the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea to help send United to Wembley Stadium again. He then collected his first Premier League title winners medal and scored the second goal in United&#x27;s 3â0 defeat of Middlesbrough on the final day of the season to help United win the Premier League title for the third time in four years - a remarkable turnaround as his new club had been 10 points behind his old club at Christmas.

He also played in United&#x27;s FA Cup final victory to become part of England&#x27;s first ever side to win the double twice.

Before the 1996â97 season began, Cole had to deal with being offered to Blackburn Rovers as part-exchange in a Â£12Â million deal that would have brought Alan Shearer to Old Trafford, but the offer was rejected and Shearer joined Newcastle instead. Despite Alex Ferguson&#x27;s clear indication to Cole that he was looking for another striker, after the Shearer deal fell through, Cole fought to stay at the club and was handed the number 9 shirt, having previously worn 17. The arrival of Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r â and being the victim of two broken legs suffered after a tackle by Neil Ruddock in a reserve match against Liverpool, restricted Cole&#x27;s first-team chances further. However, he managed to recover by December 1996 and still played in 20 Premier League matches (ten as a substitute) for the season. Cole then ended the season strongly with several crucial goals in both the league (such as away at title rivals Arsenal), and in the UEFA Champions League (where he scored a goal voted the season&#x27;s best European goal against Porto) to complete his comeback from injury. Cole then scored the title sealing goal in a landmark 3â1 win for United at Anfield â the scene of his broken legs a few months earlier - as United moved closer to another title triumph.

For the 1997â98 season, the retirement of Eric Cantona saw Cole emerge as first choice striker once again, and he discovered his best form ever for the club. He found himself starting most of United&#x27;s games that season, either alongside Solskjaer or new signing Teddy Sheringham.

He became the joint top goalscorer in the Premier League during the course of the season with 18, several of which were spectacular efforts. The most notable was perhaps a chip against Everton, which fans voted as the Manchester United goal of the season. Cole also developed a strong partnership with Teddy Sheringham (despite considerable personal friction between the two), but United finished trophyless for only the second time in the 1990s as they surrendered their lead of the Premier League to Arsenal during the final two months of the season.

Cole achieved several personal landmarks in this campaign, scoring his first European hat-trick for the club in an away match at Feyenoord, as well as ending the season as runner-up in the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award to Arsenal&#x27;s Dennis Bergkamp. Despite this accreditation, and being the leading goalscorer in all competitions that season with 25, Cole was omitted from England&#x27;s 1998 FIFA World Cup squad by national coach Glenn Hoddle. Cole remained upbeat when interviewed and when asked about his new-found return to success, he claimed he had found freedom in his life after the injuries and erratic form of his earlier time at Old Trafford, saying he had great joy with his young son and lived for him and his family in his faith as a born-again Christian. He also claimed the friendship of Ryan Giggs, his roommate on away matches, was a major motivating factor through the tough times when fans and media doubted him at United.

Cole faced competition from new signing Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r during the 1998â99 season, but ended up developing an immensely successful partnership with Yorke. The two contributed 53 goals between them and were rated as one of the most feared attacking partnerships in Europe, with the pair scoring against sides like Barcelona away at the Camp Nou, and repeating the form all season with incredible one-touch passes and assists that at times seemed to demonstrate a telepathic understanding. Although Solskjaer still managed to excel on occasions whether as a starting player or a substitute, and Sheringham also managed to do well and score crucial goals when he played.

Cole played a key role in the side&#x27;s unique treble of the Premier League title, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Cole scored the winning goal in United&#x27;s final Premier League match of the season against Tottenham Hotspur, a result which meant United finished one point ahead of rivals Arsenal to win the Premier League title. He also scored United&#x27;s third and winning goal in their Champions League semi-final second leg against Juventus, sealing their place in the final. Also in this season, Cole scored his 100th Premier League goal in a top-of-the-table clash against Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 February; the match ended 1â1.

During United&#x27;s pre-season tour of Australia in July 1999, Cole was involved in a tackle which left 19-year-old Australian defender Simon Colosimo sidelined for six months and requiring a complete knee reconstruction. Before the injury, Colosimo was one of Australia&#x27;s best young players and was about to make a big money move to Europe, and was never able to complete a career in Europe, despite a handful of appearances for Manchester City.

Cole was United&#x27;s second top scorer again in 1999â2000 with 19 goals in 28 Premier League matches. He collected his fourth Premier League title medal in five seasons, and scored over 20 goals in all competitions for the third successive season. Cole scored many goals for United including the only goal of the game in their top-of-the-table clash against their closest rivals Leeds United. He also joined an elite group during this season by scoring his 100th goal for the club in a 2â2 draw against Wimbledon.

Another title followed in 2000â01 when, despite suffering from an injury that restricted his appearances, Cole scored 13 goals in all competitions, including four in the UEFA Champions League, allowing him (at the time) to become Manchester United&#x27;s record goal scorer in European competition of all time, eclipsing the record set some 30 years earlier by Denis Law.

The following 2001â02 season saw Cole face fresh competition from new signing Ruud van Nistelrooy, as well as Dwight Yorke, Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r and also Paul Scholes for places up front, with Sir Alex Ferguson adopting a more conservative approach, especially in European matches, by playing Scholes behind Van Nistelrooy with Roy Keane and Juan SebastiÃ¡n VerÃ³n in a three-man midfield. Despite this, Cole managed to score seven goals before leaving for Blackburn Rovers halfway through the season after falling behind to the formidable partnership of Van Nistelrooy and SolskjÃ¦r, meaning that he was often a substitute during the final months of his United career.

More than five years after his Old Trafford exit, a 35-year-old Cole made one last appearance for Manchester United in the UEFA Celebration Match six years later, on 13 March 2007, coming on at half-time for a friendly match between Manchester United and a European XI, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the European Community and 50 years of Manchester United in the European Cup.

===Blackburn Rovers===
The arrival of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Juan SebastiÃ¡n VerÃ³n counted against Cole&#x27;s first-team chances at Man Utd in the 2001â02 season, and on 29 December 2001, Cole was sold to Blackburn Rovers for Â£8Â million. Within two months of arriving, he had collected a League Cup winners medal, scoring the winning goal for Blackburn in the final against Tottenham Hotspur, who were managed by the former England manager and open critic of Cole, Glenn Hoddle. This victory meant that, in the space of seven seasons, Cole had won all four domestic trophies plus a European trophy. Cole ended the season with a total of 18 goals in all competitions, 5 for Manchester United and 13 in just 20 matches for Blackburn.

Rovers finished sixth the following season and qualified for the UEFA Cup. That campaign saw Cole reunited with Dwight Yorke, who had signed for Blackburn from Manchester United for Â£2Â million in July 2002.

Cole had a frustrating season in 2003â04 season, as Rovers slid into the bottom half of the Premier League, finishing 15th. He scored 11 goals but his relationship with manager Graeme Souness hit rock bottom after Cole reported him to the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (&quot;PFA&quot;) accusing him of unfair treatment. Cole scored 37 goals in 100 appearances in all competitions for Blackburn.

===Later career and retirement===

Thirteen years after spending a month on loan at Fulham, Cole returned to Craven Cottage for the 2004â05 season, joining them on a one-year contract. He was the club&#x27;s top scorer and scored one of the goals of the season against Liverpool. Despite this successful period at Fulham, he decided to leave the club after only one season as his family wanted to return to the North West.

Cole signed for Manchester City on a free transfer at the beginning of the 2005â06 season, and enjoyed a good start to his career at Eastlands. Stuart Pearce&#x27;s side spent most of the season in the top half of the table, but Cole&#x27;s season was ended by injury in March.

Despite signing a new contract with Manchester City only months earlier and leaving Fulham in 2005 to return to the north, Cole signed for south coast club Portsmouth on transfer deadline day (31 August 2006) for an undisclosed fee, reported as Â£500,000 with the potential to rise to Â£1Â million depending on appearances. He scored his first league goal for his new club in the 2â0 win at home to West Ham United on 14 October. However, Cole struggled to break into Harry Redknapp&#x27;s side and in March 2007, he signed on loan for Birmingham City of the Championship until the end of the season. Cole returned to Portsmouth after five appearances and one goal (against Wolverhampton Wanderers) for Birmingham. He was released on 3 August 2007.

After being released by Portsmouth at the end of the 2006â07 season, Cole signed a one-year contract with Sunderland on a free transfer, reuniting him once more with former Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers strike partner Dwight Yorke, and under the management of former United teammate Roy Keane. After seven matches for the club, Cole spent three months on loan at Burnley where he scored six goals for the Championship club, including a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Reflecting on his time at Turf Moor, Cole stated, &quot;I went to Burnley and spoke to Owen Coyle and got a great vibe. He brought the best out of me and made me feel a lot younger than my age.&quot; Cole was released by Sunderland at the end of the 2007â08 season.

On 4 July 2008, Cole signed a 12-month deal with Nottingham Forest, his 12th club and his local from his time growing up in Nottingham. However, on 31 October 2008, Forest confirmed Cole&#x27;s contract had been cancelled by mutual consent after 11 appearances and 0 goals.

On 11 November 2008, Cole announced his retirement from football, ending a 19-year career.

==International career==
Despite first being capped for England in 1995, Cole earned only 15 caps by the time he announced his retirement from international football after failing to be selected for the 2002 World Cup squad. He scored one goal for England, in a World Cup qualifying match against Albania in March 2001. He also scored in his single appearance for the England B team.

Glenn Hoddle, in defence of his decision not to select Cole for the World Cup in 1998, accused Cole of needing six or seven chances to score one goal.

A persistent toe injury in the lead up to UEFA Euro 2000 led to Cole missing out on another major competition for his country.

Cole earned his first four caps under four different managers. He made his debut in a friendly against Uruguay under Terry Venables in March 1995, coming on as a substitute for Teddy Sheringham; he appeared next against Italy under Glenn Hoddle at the Tournoi de France in 1997; made his third appearance against France under caretaker Howard Wilkinson in 1999; and finally earned his fourth cap against Poland under new manager Kevin Keegan in his first starting appearance a few weeks later.

==Coaching career==
In August 2009, Cole was hired by his former Manchester United and England teammate, Milton Keynes Dons manager Paul Ince, to coach the club&#x27;s forwards on an initially temporary basis. However, one week later, Cole agreed to spend at least two days a week working on finishing with the forwards at Huddersfield Town, under his former Newcastle United and Fulham teammate Lee Clark.
In December 2010, Cole was back at Manchester United, working at the Carrington training ground while finishing his coaching badges.
In October 2019, Cole was named as forward and attack coach assisting manager, Sol Campbell at Southend United. On 30 June 2020, manager Campbell and his three assistants including Cole left the club by mutual consent.

==Recording career==
In 1999, Cole signed to WEA/Warner Music and released a cover of the Gap Band&#x27;s &quot;Outstanding&quot; which reached number 68 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Personal life==

Cole&#x27;s father, Lincoln, emigrated to the UK from Jamaica in 1957 and worked as a coal miner in Gedling, Nottinghamshire, from 1965 to 1987.

Cole married his long-time girlfriend Shirley Dewar in July 2002. Their son, Devante, is also a professional footballer who plays as a forward for West Bromwich Albion.

In 2008, Cole was questioned by police after an alleged assault on his wife at their home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, before being released on bail. Six months later, Cole, through his representative law firm Schillings, won damages in an action against the owners of the &quot;Daily Star&quot; for defamation regarding the publication of material concerning the assault allegations and for harms caused against his family by sensationalist reports.

In April 2016, Cole was named in the Panama Papers.

Cole has condemned racial incidents in football on various occasions. In a CNN interview, Cole said that football&#x27;s authorities are not doing enough to fight racism in the sport and are content to &quot;sweep it under the carpet&quot;. In another interview, he condemned an incident involving Real Madrid&#x27;s VinÃ­cius JÃºnior where a fan racially abused the player. Cole said that the comments from the head of La Liga, suggested a permissive attitude towards racism.

===Health===
In June 2014, Cole suffered kidney failure after developing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In April 2017, he underwent a kidney transplant. His nephew Alexander was the donor.

===Charity work===
In 2000, Cole visited Zimbabwe and returned to set up his own charitable foundation, called the Andy Cole Children&#x27;s Foundation, which helped AIDS orphans in the country. The charity has since closed down. He has since set up the Andy Cole Fund to raise money for Kidney Research UK, after suffering kidney failure in 2015 after contracting an airborne virus.

==Relationships with other players==
Neil Ruddock considered Cole to be the player he most enjoyed playing against. In a candid interview with Talksport, he jokingly referred to the incident that resulted in Cole suffering two broken legs in 1997 as &quot;not big, and not clever&quot;, adding &quot;but it was great&quot;, and that &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean to break both of his legs if I&#x27;m honest, I only meant to break one&quot;.

In 2010, Cole wrote in his column in &quot;The Independent&quot; he had &quot;loathed&quot; and &quot;pretty much detested&quot; former Manchester United and England teammate Teddy Sheringham &quot;for 15 years&quot; after Sheringham did not offer to shake Cole&#x27;s hand as Cole was substituted on for Sheringham to make his England debut in a match against Uruguay at Wembley in 1995.

<text>A bazaar or souk is a marketplace consisting of multiple small stalls or shops, especially in the Middle East, the Balkans, Central Asia, North Africa and South Asia. They are traditionally located in vaulted or covered streets that have doors on each end and served as a city&#x27;s central marketplace.

The term &quot;bazaar&quot; originates from Persian, where it referred to a town&#x27;s public market district. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer collectively to the merchants, bankers and craftsmen who work in that area. The term &quot;souk&quot; comes from Arabic and refers to marketplaces in the Middle East and North Africa.

Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, the earliest evidence for the existence of bazaars or souks dates to around 3000 BCE. Cities in the ancient Middle East appear to have contained commercial districts. Later, in the historic Islamic world, bazaars typically shared in common certain institutions, such as the position of the , and certain architectural forms, such as roofed streets and courtyard buildings known in English as caravanserais. The exact details of their evolution and organization varied from region to region.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Western interest in oriental culture led to the publication of many books about daily life in Middle Eastern countries. Souks, bazaars and the trappings of trade feature prominently in paintings and engravings, works of fiction and travel writing.

Shopping at a bazaar or market-place remains a central feature of daily life in many Middle-Eastern and South Asian cities and towns and the bazaar remains the beating heart of West Asian and South Asian life; in the Middle East, souks tend to be found in a city&#x27;s old quarter. Bazaars and souks are often important tourist attractions. A number of bazaar districts have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to their historical and/or architectural significance.

== Terminology ==

=== Bazaar ===

The origin of the word &quot;bazaar&quot; comes from New Persian &quot;bÄzÄr&quot;, from Middle Persian &quot;wÄzÄr&quot;, from Old Persian &quot;wÄÄar&quot;, from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;*wahÄ-Äarana&quot;. The term spread from Persian into Arabic, now used throughout the Middle East and in the Indian subcontinent.

In North American and Europe, the English word &quot;bazaar&quot; can denote more generically a shop or market selling miscellaneous items. It can also refer in particular to a sale or fair to raise money for charitable purposes (e.g. charity bazaar).

==== Variations ====
In Turkish, the word was borrowed as , but it refers to an outdoor market held at regular intervals, not a permanent structure containing shops. English place names usually translate &quot;Ã§arÅÄ±&quot; (shopping district in a downtown or downtown itself) as &quot;bazaar&quot; when they refer to an area with covered streets or passages.

=== Souk ===

The word &quot;souk&quot; in the Arabic-speaking world is roughly equivalent to &quot;bazaar&quot;. The Arabic word is a loan from Aramaic &quot;Å¡Å«qÄ&quot; (&quot;street, market&quot;), itself a loanword from the Akkadian &quot;sÅ«qu&quot; (&quot;street&quot;). The Arabic word &quot;&quot; was then borrowed into English via French () by the 19th century. The English word can also be spelled &quot;suq&quot; or &quot;souq&quot;.

In Modern Standard Arabic the term refers to markets in both the physical sense and the abstract economic sense (e.g., an Arabic-speaker would speak of the &#x27; in the old city as well as the &#x27; for oil, and would call the concept of the free market , ).

In Israel, the term &quot;shuk&quot; or &quot;shuq&quot; () shares a common Aramaic origin of the Arabic &quot;souk&quot;, and holds a prominent role in everyday life. Markets such as Mahane Yehuda in Jerusalem are often covered rows of stalls much like those seen elsewhere in the region, selling produce, spices, halvah, and even clothing.

==== Variations ====

In northern Morocco, the Spanish corruption &quot;socco&quot; is often used as in the Grand Socco and Petit Socco of Tangiers.

== History ==

=== Origins in antiquity ===

Scholar Mohammad Gharipour has pointed out that in spite of the centrality of bazaars in Persian history, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. Historical records document the concept of a bazaar existing in Iran as early as 3000 BCE, where some large cities contained districts dedicated to trade and commerce. Archeological data also suggests the existence of market districts in ancient Mesopotamia. Markets centers must have existed in Egypt to conduct international trade, but no archeological evidence for them has been found. In Achaemenid Persia (550â330 BCE), documents indicate that crafts were sold in markets close to Persepolis. A network of bazaars had sprung up alongside ancient caravan trade routes. Bazaars located along these trade routes, formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged. Sources from around the same era also indicate that ancient Greeks regulated trade in areas at the center of their cities around &quot;stoa&quot; buildings. The ideas of Greek city planning were spread to the Middle East during the Seleucid period, following the conquests of Alexander the Great.

The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.

Sassanid rule in Iran was an important period for the development of urbanization and commerce. In Sassanid Iran, the bazaar was usually the heart of a town or city, where it spread outwards and affected the development of other neighbourhoods. The bazaar usually contained, or was adjoined by, an open-air plaza that served as a forum of socio-economic activity.

Historically, bazaars were also held outside cities at locations where incoming caravans stopped and merchants displayed their goods for sale. Bazaars were established at caravanserai, places where a caravan or caravans arrived and remained for rest and refreshments. Since this might be infrequent, souks often extended beyond buying and selling goods to include major festivals involving various cultural and social activities. Any bazaar may serve a social function as being a place for people to meet in, in addition to its commercial function.

In pre-Islamic Arabia, two types of souks existed: permanent urban markets and temporary seasonal markets. The temporary seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce. Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq &#x27;Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle East in the history of souks, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. However, documentary sources point to permanent marketplaces in cities from as early as 550 BCE.

=== Islamic period ===

According to traditional Muslim narratives, Muhammad established a market place () in Medina shortly after arriving there during the Hijrah in 622 CE. He designated an open, unbuilt space as the market area and forbade both the construction of permanent structures and the levying of taxes in this area. Eight years later, he is said to have appointed a market inspector (), a position that likely evolved into the later  in Islamic cities, an official in charge of overseeing public morality and regulating weights and measures.

Despite the importance of the bazaar to economic life and the prominence of marketplace terminology in the Quran, not much is known about the early history of bazaars and it remains a topic of ongoing research. Most of the surviving urban commercial structures in the Islamic world date from the 16th century or later, though some preserved urban caravanserais (commonly known as a , , or ) date from earlier periods. The oldest of these is the Khan al-Mirjan in Baghdad, built in 1359 as part of a larger architectural complex.

Muhammad&#x27;s prohibition against constructing permanent buildings and levying taxes in the market began to be disregarded as early as the Umayyad period (7th to 8th centuries). The Umayyad caliphs Mu&#x27;awiya I and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik both built structures in the market of Medina and levied taxes there, while purpose-built markets were built in early Islamic cities further abroad such as Basra in Iraq, Fustat in Egypt, and Kairouan in Tunisia. This process seems to have accelerated during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik () in particular. Markets that sold the most important or expensive goods were usually located near the city&#x27;s central Friday mosque. In some cities, such as Cairo and Aleppo, the main bazaar was initially focused along one important street and then progressively grew and branched off into the surrounding streets.

During the Islamic period in Iran, bazaars developed along the same lines as those of the Sassanid period. Up to the 11th century, the bazaar developed more commonly in the suburbs outside the city walls that enclosed the , the formal city. This was especially true in Central Asia, though there were exceptions in some regions where the bazaar was grouped with the citadel and the city&#x27;s Friday mosque inside the city walls. After the 11th century, the growing importance of the suburbs and the commercial districts resulted in most of them being enclosed within newly expanded city walls. From the 10th century onward, the bazaar became the financial center of a city and was heavily patronized and developed by ruling elites. The grouping of a bazaar, citadel, and Friday mosque also became more common.
In the Mamluk Sultanate (13th to 16th centuries) and in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries), the construction of commercial buildings in and around the bazaar was often sponsored by sultans, ruling elites, or by members of the Ottoman royal family. The revenues generated by these buildings were typically earmarked to support the upkeep of religious complexes sponsored by these same patrons, through the legal framework of a &quot;waqf&quot; (legal endowment).

=== 21st century ===

In the Middle East, the bazaar is considered to be &quot;the beating heart of the city and a symbol of Islamic architecture and culture of high significance.&quot; Today, bazaars are popular sites for tourists and some of these ancient bazaars have been listed as world heritage sites or national monuments on the basis of their historical, cultural or architectural value.

The Medina of Fez, Morocco, which includes numerous long market streets (e.g. Tala&#x27;a Kebira) and bazaar areas (e.g. Kissariat al-Kifah), was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Al-Madina Souk in Aleppo is the largest covered historic market in the world, with an approximate length of 13 kilometers. It is part of the Ancient Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 in Syria. The Bazaar complex in Tabriz, Iran, was listed by UNESCO in 2010. The Bazaar of Qaisiyariye in Lar, Iran, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2007. KemeraltÄ± Bazaar in Ä°zmir was placed on tentative list in 2020.

== Organization and institutions ==
Shopping at a souk or market place is part of daily life throughout much of the Middle East. Prices are commonly set by bargaining, also known as haggling, between buyers and sellers.

Bazaars or souks are traditionally divided into specialized sections dealing in specific types of product, each usually housed in a few narrow streets and named after the product it specializes in such as the gold souk, the textile souk, the spice souk, the leather souk, the booksellers&#x27; souk, etc. This promotes competition among sellers and helps buyers easily compare prices. Merchants specialized in each trade were also organized into guilds, which provided support to merchants but also to clients. The exact details of the organizations varied from region to region. Each guild had rules that members were expected to follow, but they were loose enough to allow for competition. Guilds also fulfilled some functions similar to trade unions and were able to negotiate with the government on behalf of merchants or represent their interests when needed.

Though each neighbourhood within the city would have a local souk selling food and other essentials, the main bazaar was one of the central structures of a large city, selling durable goods, luxuries and providing services such as money exchange. Workshops where goods for sale are produced (in the case of a merchant selling locally-made products) are typically located away from the souk itself.

Historically, in Islamic cities, the was the official in charge of regulating and policing the bazaar and other aspects of urban life. They monitored things such as weights and measures, pricing, cleanliness, noise, and traffic circulation, as well as being responsible for other issues of public morality. They also investigated complaints about cheating or the quality of goods. The equivalent official could be known by other titles in different regions, such as the &quot;kedkhoda&quot; in Istanbul or the &quot;amir-i bazariyan&quot; in Delhi. In the Maghreb (northwestern Africa), the also shared responsibilities with other officials such as the &quot;qadi&quot; or the .

== Layout and architecture ==
Permanent bazaars were established in urban zones, usually within the city walls and close to the heart of the city. In much of the Middle East and North Africa, the bazaar is a network of interconnected spaces, including streets and buildings, with diverse architectural forms. Its boundaries are not sharply defined and can vary according to circumstance, as the bazaar is closely integrated with its urban surroundings and with other important institutions of the city.
Although there is great variety among the bazaars of this region, there are three recurring elements, in addition to the general network of market streets. One element is the individual shops or booths that line each side of a market street. The shops are usually small spaces open to the street and occupied by merchants. They are typically equipped with large shutters which can be closed and locked when the shopkeeper is away. Another element is a more secure market area, usually centrally located and consisting of streets that were covered or roofed. This complex is variably known as a &quot;, &quot;, or &quot;&quot;, depending on the city or historical period. It usually hosted the most prestigious and profitable trades such as jewelry, perfumes, and textiles. In order to protect these goods, the entrances to this area could be closed and locked at night or in times of danger. The other recurring element is the presence of courtyard buildings entered via a single large doorway. Often translated into English as a caravanserai, this type of building is known in different regions as a , , , or . They could serve a variety of functions including an inn for travelers and merchants, a manufacturing center, a trade venue, or a warehouse.

In Iran and Central Asia, the permanent bazaar is likewise in the centre of a city and had common architectural elements. These bazaars acted as financial centers of the city and were traditionally overseen by the state. Some Iranian bazaars are organized around one long market street from which other market streets branch off (e.g. in Isfahan or Tehran), while others are large rectangular zones with a grid-like network of parallel and intersecting streets (e.g. as in Tabriz). The streets are lined with structures of one or two storeys that contain spaces for shops. The streets are typically roofed with brick vaults, pierced by skylights to allow for light and air circulation. The shops are often adjacent or connected to the workshops where the goods are also produced, so that manufacturing and retail are often concentrated in the same areas, though some production (especially of textiles) was also distributed in other parts of the city. Like the bazaars further west, there were also many &quot;khÄn&quot;s (caravanserais) built in the area. They acted as warehouses, production centers, wholesale centers, hostels for merchants, and offices for conducting business. 

In the cities that developed under the Ottoman Empire, there was generally one central bazaar area, known in Turkish as the . The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, known locally as the (&#x27;covered market&#x27;), is a famous example. Additionally, several types of market structures were common: the , the , and the (Turkish cognate of &quot;khÄn&quot;). The Ottoman &quot;bedesten&quot; was a solid stone building, typically rectangular and roofed by domes, with shops inside. Like the or &#x27; in other regions, it hosted the most important and luxurious trades. The is usually an elongated market structure or market street with shops lining its faÃ§ades. &quot;Arasta&quot;s could be independent markets built outside the main bazaar area, such as those built as part of large religious complexes like the Selimiye Mosque complex in Edirne or the Sultanahmet Mosque complex in Istanbul. The Spice Bazaar or (&#x27;Egyptian Market&#x27;) in Istanbul is also one of the largest and best-known examples. The is similar in function to other &#x27; or caravanserai buildings elsewhere, with a courtyard enclosed by two storeys. The ground floor was usually used for storage and for stabling horses, while the upper floor housed merchants.

== Temporary souks ==
A temporary, seasonal souk is held at a set time that might be yearly, monthly or weekly. The oldest souks were set up annually, and were typically general festivals held outside cities. For example, Souk Ukadh was held yearly in pre-Islamic times in an area between Mecca and Taâif during the sacred month of Dhu al-Qi&#x27;dah. While a busy market, it was more famous for its poetry competitions, judged by prominent poets such as Al-Khansa and Al-Nabigha. An example of an Islamic annual souk is Al Mirbid just outside Basra, also famed for its poetry competitions in addition to its storytelling activities. Temporary souks tended to become known for specific types of produce. For example, Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq &#x27;Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. Political, economic and social changes have left only the small seasonal souks outside villages and small towns, primarily selling livestock and agricultural products.

Weekly markets have continued to function throughout the Arab world. Most of them are named from the day of the week on which they are held. They usually have open spaces specifically designated for their use inside cities. Examples of surviving markets are the Wednesday Market in Amman that specializes in the sale of used products, the Ghazl market held every Friday in Baghdad specializing in pets; the Finaâ Market in Marrakech offers performance acts such as singing, music, acrobats and circus activities.

In tribal areas, where seasonal souks operated, neutrality from tribal conflicts was usually declared for the period of operation of a souk to permit the unhampered exchange of surplus goods. Some of the seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce such as Suq Hijr in Bahrain, noted for its dates while Suq &#x27;Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle Eastern market place, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.

== In art and literature â Orientalism ==
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the &quot;Orient.&quot; Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups â the &quot;European West&quot; and the &quot;East or Orient&quot;; &quot;us&quot; and the &quot;other.&quot; Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilization; the peoples could be threatening- they were &quot;despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational.&quot; At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.

===Subject-matter===

Many of these works were lavishly illustrated with engravings of every day scenes of Oriental lifestyles, including scenes of market places and market trade. Artists focused on the exotic beauty of the land â the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favorite subject matter. Some of these works were propaganda designed to justify European imperialism in the East, however many artists relied heavily on their everyday experiences for inspiration in their artworks. For example, Charles D&#x27;Oyly, who was born in India, published the &quot;Antiquities of Dacca&quot; featuring a series of 15 engraved plates of Dacca [now Dhaka, Bangladesh] featuring scenes of markets, commerce, buildings and streetscapes. European society generally frowned on nude painting â but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.

===Notable Orientalist artists===

Notable artists in the Orientalist genre include: Jean-LÃ©on GÃ©rÃ´me Delacroix (1824â1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803â1860), Frederic Leighton (1830â1896), EugÃ¨ne Alexis Girardet 1853-1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827â1910) who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce. French painter Jean-Ãtienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled &quot;From the Black Sea through Persia and India.&quot; Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-LÃ©on GÃ©rÃ´me Delacroix (1824â1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803â1860), Frederic Leighton (1830â1896), EugÃ¨ne Alexis Girardet 1853â1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827â1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.

=== Orientalist literature ===

A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.

Many English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; (translated into English from the French in 1705â08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia,&quot; (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron&#x27;s &quot;Oriental Tales,&quot; is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.

Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce. Examples of travel writing include: &quot;Les Mysteres de L&#x27;Egypte Devoiles&quot; by Olympe Audouard published in 1865 and Jacques Majorelle&#x27;s &quot;Road Trip Diary of a Painter in the Atlas and the Anti-Atlas&quot; published in 1922

<doc id="556909" wikidata="Q810016" url="?curid=556909" title="Basil Coetzee">
<text>Basil &quot;Manenberg&quot; Coetzee (2 February 1944 â 11 March 1998) was a South African musician, perhaps best known as a saxophonist.

==Biography==
Coetzee was born in District Six, Cape Town, South Africa. Mountain Records describes Coetzee thus: His distinctive raunchy tenor sound and the untiring commitment to his cultural roots made him one of the best known jazzmen to come out of South Africa. He earned the nickname &quot;Manenberg&quot; after the hugely successful collaboration with Dollar Brand in the late seventies. Basil toured and recorded extensively with Brand (Abdullah Ibrahim). Together with Robbie Jansen they created the unique brass sound of the group The Pacific Express inspiring many younger cape jazz musicians in Cape Town.

He is probably best known for his recording work with Abdullah Ibrahim (previously known as Dollar Brand). Ibrahim recorded his composition &quot;Mannenberg&quot; with Coetzee â it became an enormous hit in the townships and impressed musicians as the recording is reputed to have been made in just one take.

Abdullah Ibrahim is quoted by the BBC as saying, &quot;Even Basil himself said that in later years he would use that solo as a study exercise. We also use it now in our teaching as a required solo that young musicians have to play.&quot;

The composition &quot;Manenberg&quot; became a South African jazz classic, and is also internationally renowned (indeed, a visit to the Cape Town waterfront will still today reward the jazz enthusiast with the &quot;Manenberg&quot; jazz venue).

An article in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; records that &quot;Coetzee developed a soulful, gospel-influenced instrumental voice which had a raw, impassioned urgency at its core. He often explained that his sound was reflection of the life around him, a product of the fact that &#x27;there&#x27;s a lot of poverty in the townships, and people are frustrated, and my sound is created within that environment.&#x27;&quot;

Coetzee was signed to the Cape Town based Mountain Records label for a large part of his recording career and made his only solo albums for the label.

In 1988 he toured Europe, and released the album &quot;Sabenza&quot;, with Robbie Jansen, Paul Abrahams (bassist) and Jack Momple, who had all left American-influenced jazz in search of their Cape roots. Recorded in one week, this album changed perceptions about local jazz and includes some Cape Jazz jewels. It was followed by the album &quot;Monwabisi&quot;, Coetzee&#x27;s second solo project. It was recorded in difficult times for the artist as he sought to establish his name away from previous successful associations. In the period between leaving his former Pacific Express associates and playing only sporadically for Ibrahim, Coetzee and bass player Paul Abrahams worked together as a duo. Many of the works on this album were arranged and written by them.

After Abdullah Ibrahim&#x27;s return to South Africa from exile, Coetzee regularly performed in Ibrahim&#x27;s various ensembles. The band Sabenza was active on the local scene, and regularly featured bassist Paul Abrahams, guitarist James Kibby, and drummer Vic Higgins.

&quot;B:&quot; was Coetzee&#x27;s third solo album, released at about the time of his death in March 1998. This album contains some of his best work and includes contributions from players who worked with him for many years.

Basil Coetzee died during the night of 11 March 1998, after a long struggle with cancer, survived by five children and six grandchildren. His funeral took place on Saturday 14 March 1998 in Mitchell&#x27;s Plain, and he is buried in the Garden of Eden in Ottery. Abdullah Ibrahim was one of those who paid tribute to Basil&#x27;s memory at his funeral, announcing plans for the establishment of a Basil Manenberg Coetzee Music Academy in his memory. Coetzee&#x27;s son, Basil Coetzee, Jr., played saxophone in the service.

==Albums==

Basil Coetzee&#x27;s recording years spanned 1962â97, playing both tenor saxophone and flute. He has 18 recording sessions to his name, but his own compositions appear only on his Mountain Records releases. These albums include:

*&quot;Sabenza&quot; MOU522 - 1988 
*&quot;Monwabisi&quot; MOU592 - 1993 
*&quot;B:&quot; MOU7522 - 1998
*&quot;Passport - The Best of Basil Coetzee&quot; - 2014 (Digital only)

<text>Dion Dublin (born 22 April 1969) is an English former professional footballer, television presenter and pundit. He is a club director of Cambridge United.

As a player he was a centre-forward, notably playing in the Premier League for Manchester United, Coventry City and Aston Villa. He also had spells in the Scottish Premiership with Celtic, in the Conference with Wycombe Wanderers, and in The Football League with Cambridge United, Barnet, Millwall, Leicester City and Norwich City. He was capped four times for England.

Following his retirement from football, Dublin moved into the entertainment business. He is also an amateur percussionist, and invented a percussion instrument called &quot;The Dube&quot;. In 2011, he accompanied Ocean Colour Scene in a gig at the University of East Anglia, Norwich. In 2015, he joined the presenting team on the BBC One daytime show &quot;Homes Under the Hammer&quot; and has appeared as a regular pundit for BBC Sport on &quot;Football Focus&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and &quot;Final Score&quot;. He also occasionally provides co-commentary on live televised FA Cup games.

==Club career==

===Norwich City===
Dublin was born in Leicester. While at school he played for several Leicestershire youth teams, including Wigston Fields and Thurmaston Magpies. He then went on to begin his professional footballing career with Norwich City after leaving school in 1985, but never made a first-team appearance and was released by the club in 1988.

===Cambridge United===
In August 1988, Dublin joined Cambridge United on a free transfer, as a centre-forward, which had been his position at Norwich City. However, due to injuries he had to make a number of appearances at centre-half. His prolific goalscoring helped United to successive promotions. During the 1988â89 season, Dublin was then loaned out for short spells with Barnet and Wycombe Wanderers. The 1989â90 season saw Cambridge promoted from the Fourth Division via the play-offs, when Dublin became the first ever scorer in a Wembley play-off final.

In the 1990â91 season, the club were champions of the Third Division, and the club also reached the quarter-final of the FA Cup in both seasons, with Dublin scoring at Arsenal in 1991. In the 1991â92 season, he played a big part in helping Cambridge to their highest ever finishing position in the football league, by finishing in fifth place in the last season of the old Second Division, but when Cambridge failed to win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs Dublin was put up for sale. He has since spoken many times of his affection for Cambridge United.

===Manchester United===
Having seen Dublin in a cup tie, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signed him for Â£1Â million on 7 August 1992, fighting off competition from Chelsea and Everton. Dublin was something of a surprise purchase for United, after Ferguson had tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton but lost out to Blackburn Rovers.

He scored in United&#x27;s fourth Premier League game of the 1992â93 season, a last minute winner in United&#x27;s first Premier league victory â 1â0 against Southampton at The Dell. However, on 2 September, he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1â0 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle by Eric Young, and was out of action for six months. By the time he had recovered, however, United had signed Eric Cantona and the Frenchman was firmly established as first choice strike partner to Mark Hughes. United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner&#x27;s medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League.

In the 1993â94 season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by the successful partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with Everton manager Howard Kendall, that would have seen Dublin moving to Goodison Park, but a member of Everton&#x27;s board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through â this dispute sparked Kendall&#x27;s resignation as manager. Dublin would remain a United player for another nine months, but never managed to claim a regular place in the first team.

He managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3â2 home win over Oldham Athletic in early April, his goal helping secure a vital victory in the title run-in during a spell when United started to drop points and Blackburn Rovers were closing in on them. He also managed a further goal in the Football League Cup second round first leg, as United were beaten 2â1 by Stoke City at the Victoria Ground. The goal against Oldham was the only competitive goal that Dublin scored for United at Old Trafford. He was left out of the FA Cup winning team against Chelsea and failed to make enough appearances to merit another Premier League title winners medal. In September 1994, he was sold to Coventry City for Â£2Â million â a record signing for Coventry City at the time â and also one of the largest fees received by Manchester United.

===Coventry City===
In four years with Coventry, Dublin established himself as one of the Premier League&#x27;s top strikers and during the 1997â98 season won the first of his four full England caps. That season, he equalled the Coventry City record for most goals in a top division season, with 23 goals in all competitions.

Following Phil Neal&#x27;s departure in 1995, the arrival of Ron Atkinson and Gordon Strachan would see Dublin fit into an attacking team in the typical Atkinson mould. It included the likes of Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby to add to the already attack minded Peter Ndlovu. The addition of Gary McAllister, following UEFA Euro 1996, should have provided mid-table stability, but the team&#x27;s defensive frailties often undermined Dublin&#x27;s scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premier League history in May 1997. Despite having won away to Liverpool (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and at home to Chelsea at the start of April, the &quot;Sky Blues&quot; could only manage two points from their following three games. City went into the final day second from bottom of the table, needing not only to beat Tottenham away from home, but also for results elsewhere in the league to go their way for them to escape relegation. They achieved the most unlikely of escapes; first-half goals from Dublin and Paul Williams gave Coventry a 2â1 win at White Hart Lane, while Sunderland lost at Wimbledon and Middlesbrough could only manage a draw at Leeds. Coventry finished the season in 17th place, one point outside the relegation zone.

The following season, the Sky Blues improved at home and enjoyed a season of mid-table security. Dublin formed an impressive partnership with Darren Huckerby which not only produced some memorable goals, but also propelled the Sky Blues to the FA Cup sixth round against Sheffield United; a game they narrowly lost in a penalty shoot-out.
On 8 November 1997, Dublin scored one of the most bizarre goals in Premier League history. Early in the match against Newcastle, goalkeeper Shay Given collected a cross from the right and placed the ball in front of him. The ball was still in play, and Dublin, who had attempted to meet the cross and was now behind Given, reappeared and calmly slotted the ball into the empty goal. This led to the joke: &quot;Shay Given, the only Irishman who doesn&#x27;t know where Dublin is.&quot; The match ended 2-2, with Dublin also scoring City&#x27;s second goal in the second half.
The 1997â98 season also saw Dublin share elite status as the Premier League&#x27;s top scorer with Blackburn Rovers&#x27; Chris Sutton and Liverpool&#x27;s Michael Owen â each Englishman scoring 18 league goals. During this season, Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson tabled a bid which Dublin rejected. He remained at Highfield Road and contributed to Coventry&#x27;s best finish to date in the Premiership (11th).

===Aston Villa===
Dublin was controversially excluded from the England 1998 FIFA World Cup squad, despite being the Premier League&#x27;s joint top-scorer in the 1997â98 season. However, his exploits at club level were still attracting significant attention, and in the autumn of 1998, he chose to move to Aston Villa for Â£5.75Â million. In his first four games for the club, he would score seven goals, including a memorable hat-trick against Southampton in only his second game for Villa. As a result, he is one of only six players to score in the first four consecutive games for a Premier League club.

In December 1999, while playing for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday, he sustained a life-threatening broken neck, as a result of which he permanently has a titanium plate holding three neck vertebrae together. Just days before suffering this injury, it was reported in the &quot;News of the World&quot; that Dublin would soon be sold by Aston Villa for a fee of around Â£6Â million as the club looked to finance a fall in its share value as a result of manager John Gregory&#x27;s heavy expenditure on players.

However, the injury did not end Dublin&#x27;s career and he was back in action three months later.

In April 2000, a week after returning to the team, he helped Aston Villa reach their first FA Cup final in 43 years, which they lost 1â0 against Chelsea, scoring a penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Bolton Wanderers. 

Faced with competition for a first-team place by new signings Juan Pablo Ãngel and Peter Crouch, Dublin spent several weeks on loan at First Division Millwall towards the end of the 2001â02 season. In his time there, he scored two goals, against Stockport County and Grimsby Town in five league matches to help them into the play-offs, where despite Dublin&#x27;s goal in the first leg of the semi-final, against Villa&#x27;s arch rivals Birmingham City, Millwall lost 2â1 on aggregate.
Following Millwall&#x27;s elimination from the play-offs, Dublin returned to Aston Villa in time for their final game of the season, against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He replaced Darius Vassell in the 84th minute and scored Villa&#x27;s third goal in a 3â1 win.

Dublin once again found himself a first-choice striker at the start of the 2002â03 season, partnering Vassell up front. In March 2003, he was sent off at Villa Park for a headbutt on Robbie Savage in the Birmingham derby match, which ended 2â0 to Birmingham City.

===Leicester City===
When his contract expired in the summer of 2004, he was given a free transfer. He was signed by Leicester City, who had been relegated from the Premier League to the Championship. In his first season with the club, he scored only four goals in 38 competitive matches. During the 2005â06 season, Dublin lost his place as the team&#x27;s main striker, but continued to appear as a defender. His contract at Leicester City was terminated by mutual consent on 30 January 2006.

===Celtic===
He was snapped up quickly by then Celtic manager Gordon Strachan, to cover for the loss of Chris Sutton, on a contract until the end of the season. At Celtic, Dublin achieved double success, with Scottish League Cup and Scottish Premier League winner&#x27;s medals. On 19 March 2006, Dublin came on as a substitute and scored the final goal as Celtic defeated Dunfermline 3â0 to win the Scottish League Cup final, and also played enough matches with Celtic to merit a title medal. In the league, he made three league starts and eight substitute appearances for Celtic, scoring once against Kilmarnock on 9 April 2006 in a 4â1 win at Rugby Park. Despite one or two decent performances for the Parkhead outfit, Dublin was released by Strachan in May 2006.

===Return to Norwich City===

On 20 September 2006, Norwich City announced that Dublin had joined them until the end of the 2006â07 season. It marked a return, almost 20 years after leaving, for Dublin to the club where he began his career. He made his debut on 23 September 2006 when he came on as substitute against Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first competitive goal in Norwich City colours in a 3â3 draw against Queens Park Rangers on 14 October 2006 at Loftus Road. Steve Wilson cited Dublin as the main inspiration behind Norwich&#x27;s 4â1 FA Cup 3rd Round win at Tamworth, in which the striker scored two goals and set up numerous chances for other teammates.

Dublin was an important figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in second place in the Norwich City player of the year award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2007â08 season. On 2 September 2007, while working as a pundit on a match between Aston Villa and Chelsea, Dublin said that this season would be his last as a professional footballer, citing the fact that his &quot;bones have started to talk to him&quot; as the reason, meaning that he did not think his body can handle another season.

In the spring of 2008, Dublin was approached by Jimmy Quinn, then manager of Cambridge United, about joining his old club for the 2008â09 season. However, the player would not change his mind about retiring. He was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Year and awarded the Barry Butler trophy on 26 April 2008 in his final season as a footballer, at his penultimate game, and on his final appearance at Carrow Road. Dublin played his final game on 4 May 2008, featuring in Norwich&#x27;s 4â1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in front of 36,208 fans at Hillsborough â the highest Championship attendance that season. When he was taken off in the 66th minute, Dublin received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters and players, and referee Mark Clattenburg.

==International career==
Dublin earned his first cap for England on 11 February 1998, playing the whole 90 minutes in the 2â0 friendly defeat to Chile at Wembley Stadium. In the run-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Dublin played in the King Hassan II International Cup Tournament in May, starting in the 1â0 win against Morocco, and coming off the bench in 0â0 draw with Belgium, a game England lost on penalties. Despite showing good form and versatility throughout the season, including finishing joint top scorer in the Premier League with 18 goals, Glenn Hoddle included Les Ferdinand ahead of Dublin in his 22-man squad for the tournament in France. On 18 November, he started in the 2â0 friendly win against the Czech Republic at Wembley Stadium. This turned out to be Dublin&#x27;s last cap for his country. He won four caps for England but did not score any goals.

==Television career==
Since retiring from football, Dublin has worked in the media as a pundit for Sky Sports. As well as appearing on &quot;Ford Super Sunday&quot; with Richard Keys, Dublin has commentated on a number of games including the UEFA Champions League games with Martin Tyler. He has also been a member of the panel on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;. He has also co-presented &quot;606&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live, Match of the Day 2 and was also a regular on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Late Kick Off&quot; in the East region. He joined Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts on &quot;Homes Under the Hammer&quot; in 2015.

Also for the BBC, he has appeared as a regular pundit for BBC Sport namely on &quot;Football Focus&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; or &quot;Final Score&quot;. He also occasionally provides co-commentary on live televised FA Cup games.

In August 2021 it was announced that Dublin would be a competitor on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. He reached the final.

==Personal life==
Away from football, during his spell with Norwich, he invented a percussion instrument called The Dube, a form of cajÃ³n. In 2011, he accompanied Ocean Colour Scene during a gig at the University of East Anglia.

<text>The White Ensign, at one time called the St George&#x27;s Ensign because of the simultaneous existence of a crossless version of the flag, is an ensign worn on British Royal Navy ships and shore establishments. It consists of a red St George&#x27;s Cross on a white field, identical to the flag of England except with the Union Flag in the upper canton.

The White Ensign is also worn by yachts of members of the Royal Yacht Squadron and by ships of Trinity House escorting the reigning monarch.

In addition to the United Kingdom, several other nations have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with the St George&#x27;s Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge omitting the cross altogether. Yachts of the Royal Irish Yacht Club wear a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the Heraldic Badge of Ireland. The Flag of the British Antarctic Territory and the Commissioners&#x27; flag of the Northern Lighthouse Board place the Union emblem in the first quarter of a white field, omitting the overall red St George&#x27;s Cross, but they are not ensigns for use at sea.

==History==


English naval ensigns were first used during the 16th century, and were often striped in green and white (the Tudor colours), but other colours were also used to indicate different squadrons, including blue, red and tawny brown. (These striped ensigns can be seen in use on both English and Spanish warships in contemporary paintings of the 1588 Spanish Armada battles). Later, there was usually a St George&#x27;s Cross in the upper canton, or sewn across the field as on the modern White Ensign. These striped ensigns continued in use under the Stuart kings: the Naval ensign of 1623 is described as having &quot;15 horizontal stripes alternately blue, white and yellow with a Cross of St George in the canton&quot;. This design fell out of use after 1630, with the introduction of the Red, White and Blue ensigns. The use of stripes continued in the red and white of both the flag of the Honourable East India Company, adopted in 1600, and of the 1775 Grand Union Flag that formed the basis for the modern flag of the United States, and the red, white and blue striped ensign that is the flag of Hawaii.

The first recognisable White Ensign appears to have been in use during the 16th century, consisting of a white field with a broad St George&#x27;s Cross and a second St. George&#x27;s Cross in the canton. By 1630 the white ensign consisted of simply a white field, with a small St George&#x27;s Cross in the canton, which was consistent with the red and blue ensigns of the time. In 1707, the St. George&#x27;s Cross was reintroduced to the flag as a whole, though not as broad as before, and the Union Flag was placed in the canton. There was also a version of this flag without the overall St George&#x27;s Cross, which appears to have been for use in home waters only, though this flag appears to have fallen out of use by 1720. In 1801, after the Act of Union 1800, the flag was updated to include the new Union Flag in the canton, and so took on the form as used today. The blue field of the Union Flag was darkened at this time at the request of the Admiralty, in the hope that the new flags would not require replacing as often as the previous design, due to fading of the blue. Throughout this period, the proportions of the flags changed. In 1687, the then Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, instructed that flags be of the ratio 11:18 (18Â inches long for each breadth, 11Â inches at the time). In the early 18th century, the breadth of cloth had been reduced to 10Â inches, so the flags became 5:9. In 1837, the breadth was reduced for the final time to 9Â inches, giving the current ratio of 1:2.

Throughout this period in the history of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign was one of three ensigns in use, with each one being assigned to one of the three squadrons of the navy, according to its colour (red, white and blue, with red being the most senior and blue the least). Ships flew the colour of ensign corresponding to the squadron to which they were attached, which was in turn determined by the seniority of the admiral under whose command the ship sailed (a rear admiral of the red was senior to a rear admiral of the white).

In 1864 the Admiralty decided to end the ambiguity caused by the Red Ensign being both a civil ensign and a naval ensign, and the White Ensign was reserved to the Royal Navy; the relevant Order in Council retained the option to use Red or Blue Ensigns in HM Ships if desired.


==Current use==
===United Kingdom (including British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies)===

Royal Navy ships and submarines wear the White Ensign at all times when underway on the surface. The White Ensign may also be worn on a gaff, and may be shifted to the starboard yardarm when at sea. When alongside, the White Ensign is worn at the stern, with the Union Jack flag flown as a jack at the bow, during daylight hours. The logo of Royal Navy features a waving White Ensign at the top. 
The White Ensign is worn at the mastheads when Royal Navy ships are dressed on special occasions such as the King&#x27;s birthday, and may be similarly be worn by foreign warships when in British waters when dressed in honour of a British holiday or when firing a salute to British authorities. The White Ensign may also be worn by the boats of commissioned ships. Yachts of the Royal Yacht Squadron and the Trinity House vessels when escorting the British Monarch (King or Queen of the United Kingdom) are also permitted to wear the White Ensign. 
On land, the White Ensign is flown at all naval shore establishments (which are commissioned warships), including all Royal Marines establishments. Permission has been granted to some other buildings with naval connections to fly the White Ensign. This includes the St Martin-in-the-Fields Anglican Church in Trafalgar Square, London, which is the parish church of the Admiralty. The Ensign is also displayed on the Cenotaph alongside the Union Jack flag (for the British Army) and the Royal Air Force Ensign, in memory of the dead in the World Wars. Special permission was granted to any individual or body to fly the White Ensign to mark Trafalgar Day and the victory in the naval Battle of Trafalgar on its 201st anniversary in 2006.

The U.S. Navy destroyer is the only U.S. warship to fly the White Ensign along with the Stars and Stripes to honour her British namesake, the former prime minister. Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s , although a merchant ship, appears to have worn (and still bears and flies, preserved in dry dock as a historical exhibit/museum ship) the White Ensign, apparently because its first master (an ex-Royal Navy man) brought it with him.

===Commonwealth of Nations===


The White Ensign was historically used, in its unaltered form, by the naval forces of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, with the Blue Ensign of each of these Dominions (as they were then known) as a jack. In 1965, with the adoption of the Maple Leaf Canadian flag, Canada stopped using the White Ensign on its naval vessels in favour of the new flag. Following a reorganisation of the Canadian armed forces in 1968, a new &quot;white ensign&quot; was adopted, incorporating the Canadian flag in the canton and a badge in the fly. This flag, however, was until 2013 not used as the ensign, but as the jack, and also as the basis of the sovereign&#x27;s colours of the Royal Canadian Navy. In May 2013 the Canadian &quot;white ensign&quot; became the ensign and the national flag the jack. Many Canadian veterans&#x27; organisations still use the original White and Blue Ensigns unofficially as symbols of history and heritage.

During Australia&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam, the RAN modified the White Ensign (1967) to create a uniquely Australian ensign which would avoid any confusion with UK vessels; Britain was not involved in the conflict. New Zealand followed suit in 1968. The modified RAN and RNZN White Ensigns incorporate the Union Flag in the first quarter, but with the Southern Cross designs from each national flag (blue stars for the RAN and red stars for the RNZN) replacing St. George&#x27;s Cross.

Several other Commonwealth navies also use naval ensigns with a visual connection to the White Ensign. For example, the South African Navy have retained a cross on a white field, with their own national flag in the canton, in place of the Union Flag. The Royal Indian Marine (Royal Indian Navy from 1934) used the unaltered White Ensign as its ensign from 1928 until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth. After that date, the Royal Indian Navy became the Indian Navy and the Union Jack in the canton was replaced with the Indian tricolour.

=== Other former British colonies ===

=== United States ===

Aside from being flown by the , the British Naval Ensign is authorised to be used at the memorial on the campus of The Citadel. The White Ensign also flies over the British Cemetery on Ocracoke, North Carolina, which contains the remains of several seamen from , as well as a memorial to the lost naval trawler, which was sunk off the coast of Ocracoke Island in May 1942.

===Non military usage===

The Flag of the British Antarctic Territory is a white ensign defaced with the territory&#x27;s coat of arms. This is the only white ensign in use by a British Overseas Territory.

A White Ensign, without Saint Patrick&#x27;s Saltire, defaced with a blue lighthouse in the fly, is the Commissioners&#x27; flag of the Northern Lighthouse Board. This flag is unique as it uses a pre-1801 Union Flag in the canton.

The burgee of the Royal Naval Tot Club of Antigua and Barbuda is sometimes misidentified as a White Ensign; the burgee is a white swallowtail pennant (similar to a Royal Navy Commodore&#x27;s) with the Union Flag is use until 1801 in the upper hoist canton.

In the 19th and early 20th century, steamers of the Furness Railway on Lake Windemere flew the white ensign &quot;as the admiralty only exercised jurisdiction over the high seas&quot; and &quot;repeated requests from the admiralty to desist were met with polite refusals&quot;

An unofficial white ensign design featuring the royal symbols of the dominions and India was created in the early 20th century to demonstrate the British Empire evolving into a community of nations. It was flown throughout the interwar period for events such as Empire Day and the British Empire Exhibition. The Dangarsleigh War Memorial still flies it on some occasions.

The Bahamas uses a variant of its white ensign, with a blue cross instead of the red Cross of St George found on the naval ensign, as a government and &#x27;non combatant&#x27; ensign, serving a similar purpose to the UK&#x27;s Blue Ensign.

The Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club of Bermuda uses a white ensign defaced with the red abbreviation R.H.A.D.C. and surmounted by St. Edward&#x27;s Crown.

The New South Wales Ambulance service uses a white ensign defaced with the badge of the service.

The Sydney Ferries house flag is a variant of the white ensign.

<text>Marabi is a style of music and dance form that evolved and emerged in South Africa between the 1890s and 1920s.

The early part of the century saw the increasing urbanisation of black South Africans in mining centres such as the gold mining area around Johannesburg - the Witwatersrand. This led to the development of township slums or ghettos, and out of this hardship came forth new forms of music, marabi and kwela amongst others.
Marabi was the name given to a keyboard style (often using cheap pedal organs) that had a musical link to American jazz, ragtime and blues, with roots deep in the African tradition. Early marabi musicians were part of an underground musical culture and were typically not recorded. Indeed, as with early jazz in the US, the music incurred the displeasure of the establishment. Nonetheless, as with early jazz, the lilting melodies and catchy rhythms of marabi found their way into the sounds of popular dance bands with a distinctively South African style.

The sound of marabi was intended to draw people into local bars or &quot;shebeens&quot; (where illicit drinks like skokiaan were sold), and to get them dancing. &quot;Shebeens&quot; resemble the American speakeasies of the prohibition era where American Jazz was very popular.

Marabi is characterised by a few simple chords repeated in varying vamping patterns that could go on for a long time; repetitive harmonic patterns being typical of traditional African musics. This was the case so people could dance for extended periods of time without having to know the songs well. People were able to pick up the feel and rhythm of the song after a few times through the progression.

The most famous of marabi&#x27;s venues were the shebeens, and the weekend-long slumyard parties. For almost everyone outside ghetto life, however, marabi and its subculture were shunned. Associated with illegality, police raids, sex and a desperately impoverished working class, marabi was thought of as a corrupting menace and for this reason, it is no surprise that no early marabi musicians were recorded.

A reflection of this music can be heard in the music of such Cape Jazz performers as Basil Coetzee or Abdullah Ibrahim. The beginnings of broadcast radio intended for black listeners and the growth of an indigenous recording industry helped propel such sounds to immense popularity from the 1930s onward.

Such bands produced the first generation of professional black musicians in South Africa. Over the years, marabi developed into early mbaqanga, arguably the most distinctive form of South African music. This has continued to influence South African music since then, from the jazz performers of the post-war years to the more populist township forms of the 1980s and onwards. With the infusion of more traditional influences, marabi has lost much of its link to the style&#x27;s jazz roots and is now part of the African music culture as opposed to South African Jazz.

The synthesis of American jazz with marabi produced the tsaba-tsaba style in the 1940s, best known for the international hit &quot;Skokiaan&quot;.

One of the most notable musical pieces that contain a hint of Marabi is Paul Simon&#x27;s 1986 epic, &quot;Graceland&quot;. The Garland Encyclopedia of Music says, &quot;Fundamental to much of the musical mix (of Graceland) was the influence of the African-American jazz, introduced into South Africa by transnational record-distribution networks in the 1920s. Most South African jazz musicians could not read scores, so they developed their own jazz flavor, mixing American swing with African melodies. The dynamic blend of african-american structure and African style became the basis for early South African township jazz known as marabi.&quot;

<text>CKNX-TV was a television station owned by CTVglobemedia (now known as Bell Media) which served mid-western Ontario, Canada. It was part of the A television system. The station&#x27;s offices, studios, and transmission facilities were located at Carling Terrace corner John Street in Wingham. A bureau in Owen Sound closed down in late 2004.

In February 2009, CTV announced it would not renew CKNX&#x27;s broadcast licence for the 2009-2010 television season and put the station up for sale. In April 2009, CTV announced a deal to sell the station along with two other sister stations in Windsor and Brandon to Shaw Communications for a dollar; however, the deal was rejected in June. As a result, CKNX closed down as a separate station on August 31, 2009, with its transmitter remaining in operation as an analogue rebroadcaster of CFPL-DT in London.

==History==
CKNX was founded by W. T. &quot;Doc&quot; Cruickshank and signed on as a CBC Television affiliate on November 18, 1955. It was based in a former high school along with its sister AM radio station CKNX. After going to air, one of their early identification cards displayed the station&#x27;s mascot, which was a smiling television camera wearing a large cowboy hat.

On March 8, 1962, the building which accommodated the CKNX radio and television stations caught fire. Although nothing could be salvaged, CKNX-TV was on the air again later that night with the help of nearby stations CFPL-DT, CKVR-DT, CKCO-DT, and CBLT-DT. CKNX operations continued as such (with various temporary offices set up in Wingham) until they purchased new equipment and moved into a new building in 1963.

That year, the station expanded its coverage to Kitchener in response to CKCO-TV&#x27;s affiliation with CTV. Staffers were required to be more versatile than ever to better compete, giving them well-rounded knowledge for moving up in the industry. For example, the zany host of the noon cartoon program would often become the serious anchor for the 12:30 newscast.

===As an independent and The New NX===
CKNX disaffiliated from the CBC on September 4, 1988 and operated an independent station for nearly ten years until CHUM Limited purchased the station from Baton Broadcasting. Under the ownership of CHUM, the station joined the NewNet system and was accordingly rebranded &quot;The New NX&quot;.

The New NX&#x27;s news program, &quot;NewsNow&quot;, drew the lowest viewership of all NewNet stations (82,000) which is not surprising, since it was in the smallest NewNet market. News programming aired on CKNX was simulcast from CFPL in London, though CKNX viewers still received a separate 11 p.m. news feed (Monday - Friday) which originated from the CFPL studios.

===As A-Channel Wingham===
On August 2, 2005, CKNX was rebranded &quot;A-Channel&quot;, along with all of the other NewNet Stations. &quot;NewsNow at Noon&quot; was discontinued a month before the rebrand.

On July 12, 2006, CTV owner CTVglobemedia announced plans to purchase A-Channel owner CHUM Limited for , with plans to divest itself of the A-Channel and Access Alberta stations.

On April 9, 2007, it was announced that Rogers Communications filed with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to purchase all of the A-Channel stations, including CKNX, CKX-TV, Access Alberta and several cable channels being put up for sale in the wake of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s pending acquisition of the CHUM group.

On June 8, 2007, the CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited, but added a condition that CTVglobemedia must sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer while keeping the A-Channel stations (including CKNX), in effect cancelling the planned sale of A-Channel to Rogers Media.

All of the CHUM Limited channels (with the exception of Citytv) were taken over by CTVglobemedia on June 22, 2007. On July 26, 2007, CTVglobemedia named Richard Gray the head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV will report to the CTVglobemedia corporate group, not CTV News, to preserve independent news presentation and management. Gray will oversee the news departments for CKVR, CHRO, CFPL, CKNX, CHWI, CIVI and CKX-TV.

===As A Wingham===
On August 11, 2008, CKNX and all of the A-Channel stations were renamed &quot;A&quot;. The A soft launch began in June 2008 in A-Channel&#x27;s press releases and on the station&#x27;s local newscasts known as &quot;A News&quot;.

On February 25, 2009, CTV announced that, given the ongoing structural problems facing the conventional television sector in Canada and the current global economic crisis, it would not be applying to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for renewal of the licences of CKNX-TV and its sister station CHWI-TV in Wheatley/Windsor. CTV said that with the CRTC&#x27;s decision to disallow fee-for-carriage, CKNX-TV and CHWI-TVâthe two smallest stations in the A systemâwere no longer viable.

The stations&#x27; transmitters were to be shut down entirely instead of becoming rebroadcasters of London&#x27;s A station, CFPL. CFPL was expected to be available on cable, and remain available on satellite, in the affected areas following the shutdown. CTV says it would continue news coverage of the Southwestern Ontario region through CFPL and CTV network station CKCO.

On April 30, 2009, Shaw Communications announced it would purchase CKNX, CHWI and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba for a dollar each from CTVglobemedia, pending CRTC approval. However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw had backed out of the deal and declined to complete the purchase, putting the stations&#x27; futures in serious doubt.

On July 8, 2009, CTV said it would not reconsider its decision to end separate local programming on CKNX, but decided to maintain the Wingham transmitter as a rebroadcaster of CFPL, pending CRTC approval. The same day, CTV announced it would retain its sister station, CHWI in Windsor until at least 2010, based on temporary increases to the Local Programming Improvement Fund. In addition, the CRTC renewed the licences for CKNX, CHWI and CKX, even though CTV had not filed renewals for these stations. As a result, on August 31, CKNX signed off for the last time as a separate station, becoming a full-time repeater of CFPL.

 CKNX was the eighth and final television station in Canada of the 2000s to become a rebroadcaster since the CTV-owned CBC stations in Saskatchewan and Northern Ontario became rebroadcasters of CBKT in Regina and CBLT in Toronto in October 2002. In addition, Canwest-owned CHCA-TV, an E! station in Red Deer, Alberta, closed down the same day without becoming a rebroadcaster. CTV-owned CKX-TV, a CBC Television affiliate in Brandon, Manitoba followed, closing down operations on October 2 after Bluepoint Investment Corporation reneged on the sale of CKX. Both CKX and CKNX were on-air from 1955 to 2009.

===Future of CKNX-TV as a repeater===
On June 27, 2016, it was announced that Bell Media filed a proposal with the CRTC to shut down 40 of its television transmitters (all rebroadcasters of other stations), due to maintenance costs, high cable and satellite viewership, and no generation of revenue; CKNX-TV is one of the transmitters to be closed down. This was part of Bell&#x27;s regular periodic licence renewal process, which began on February 11, 2016. Bell Media explains the rationale for deleting these analog repeaters:
&quot;We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015â24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.&quot;

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony William Durnford (24 May 1830 â 22 January 1879) was an Irish career British Army officer of the Royal Engineers who served in the Anglo-Zulu War. Breveted colonel, Durnford is mainly known for his defeat by the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana, which was a disaster for the British Army.

==Background==
Durnford was born into a military family at Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, Ireland, on 24 May 1830. His father was General Edward William Durnford, also of the Royal Engineers. His younger brother, Edward, also served in the British military, as a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Marine Artillery. During his formative years he lived with his uncle in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

In July 1846 Durnford returned to England to enter the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1848 initially serving at Chatham and Scotland. In October 1851 he embarked for Ceylon and upon arrival was stationed at Trincomalee, where his assistance with defences for the harbour under Sir F Pellew was brought to the attention of the Master-General of the Ordanance by the Lords of the Admiralty. In 1853 Durnford was instrumental in saving portions of the harbour defences from destruction by fire.

Durnford volunteered for service in the Crimean War but was not accepted. In 1855 he took on civil in addition to military duties, being appointed Assistant Commissioner of Roads and Civil Engineer to the Colony. He was transferred in 1856 to Malta as an intermediate posting, but did not see active service either in the Crimea or in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. He served in Malta as an adjutant until February 1858, when he was promoted to Second Captain and posted back to Chatham and Aldershot in England. Between 1861 and 1864 Durnford commanded No. 27 Field Company, Royal Engineers, at Gibraltar.

In 1864, promoted to captain, he was transferred to China, but was invalided back to England while in transit due to heat apoplexy. After his recovery, Durnford spent the next six years at Devonport and Dublin on routine garrison duties. In 1871 he received a posting to South Africa.

On 23 January 1872, he arrived in Cape Town, still never having seen active service. He was, however, promoted to major on 5 July 1872 and lieutenant-colonel on 11 December 1873.

Of the 16 months following his arrival in the Cape, Durnford spent the greater portion at King William&#x27;s Town. In a letter to his mother he wrote of the blacks: â³...they are at least honest, chivalrous and hospitable, true to their salt, although only barbarians. They are fine men, very naked and all that sort of thing, but thoroughly good fellows.â³ He appears to have adhered to this view throughout the remaining years of his life.

He was later stationed at Pietermaritzburg, where he was befriended by Bishop Colenso, and he joined Theophilus Shepstone on an expedition to crown King Cetshwayo. Durnford had a close relationship with the bishop&#x27;s daughter Frances Ellen Colenso. His marriage, though in a poor state, meant that they remained only close friends. Miss Colenso later wrote two books in support of his military reputation, &quot;My Chief and I&quot; (1880) and &quot;History of the Zulu Wars&quot; (1880).

Durnford saw some action during the pursuit of Langalibalele at Bushman&#x27;s River Pass, where he showed great courage but received two assegai stabs, one in his side, the other in his elbow; severing a nerve thus paralysing his left under-arm and hand for the rest of his life. Durnford managed to shoot two of his assailants with his revolver and to extricate himself. His Natal Carbineers had abandoned him, but his loyal Basuto troopers stood by him.

In 1878 Durnford, as the senior Royal Engineer officer in the colony, served on Sir Henry Bulwer&#x27;s Boundary Commission to investigate the disputed border between the Transvaal and the Zulu Kingdom. Later that year he was given the task of planning the formation of an African auxiliary force which soon became the Natal Native Contingent (NNC).

==Anglo-Zulu War==

He was one of the most experienced officers of the Anglo-Zulu War --&quot;commanding presence, untiring energy and undoubted powers of leadership&quot;, he was also apt to be headstrong, and was threatened with loss of command by Lord Chelmsford. Assigned to lead the No. 2 Column of Chelmsford&#x27;s invasion army, Durnford commanded a mixed force of African troops including the Natal Native Horse and a detachment of the 1st Regiment Natal Native Contingent.

On 20 January, Durnford&#x27;s force was ordered to Rorke&#x27;s Drift to support Chelmsford&#x27;s column. That evening, a portion of the No. 2 Column under Durnford arrived at Rorke&#x27;s Drift and camped on the Zulu bank, where it remained through the next day.

Late on the evening of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to Isandlwana, as was a small detachment of No. 5 Field Company, Royal Engineers, commanded by Lieutenant John Chard, which had arrived on the 19th to repair the pontoons which bridged the Buffalo River. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke&#x27;s Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford&#x27;s column &quot;en route&quot; in the opposite direction.

Around 10:30 am on the morning of 22 January, Durnford arrived from Rorke&#x27;s Drift with five troops of the Natal Native horse and a rocket battery. A Royal Engineer, Durnford was superior in rank to Brevet Lt.-Col. Henry Pulleine, who had been left in control of the camp, and by tradition would have assumed command. Durnford did not over-rule Pulleine&#x27;s dispositions, however, and after lunch he quickly decided to take the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford&#x27;s rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree, since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.

==Durnford&#x27;s last stand==
Durnford was killed during the resulting battle, and was later criticised for taking men out of the camp thus weakening its defence. His policy was, in effect, to ride to the sound of the guns, &quot;and attack the Zulu wherever they appeared&quot;. He was well respected by his native Basutos. Moreover, the actions of Durnford and his command effectively halted the left horn of the Zulu army until their cartridge boxes began to run dry. This was no small accomplishment considering the Left Horn included the inGobamakhosi regiment, &quot;The Benders of the Kings&quot;. Their ammunition supply expended, Durnford and his troopers fought their way back to the &quot;saddle&quot; that separated the wagon park from the rest of the camp. In one last valiant effort, Durnford, after ordering his native troopers to escape, perished with a mixed group of colonial volunteers, members of the Natal Mounted Police and infantrymen of the 24th Foot that had held open the only escape route. Durnford&#x27;s body was later found lying near a wagon, surrounded by the bodies of his men.

Among the causes of the disaster were the ill-defined relationship between Durnford and Pulleine, brought about by failures of Lord Chelmsford&#x27;s command and control, a lack of good intelligence on the size and location of Zulu forces which resulted in Chelmsford splitting his force and, most decidedly, Chelmsford&#x27;s decision not to fortify the camp (which was in direct violation of his own standing pre-campaign orders).

==Popular culture==
In the 1979 film &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, which depicted the battle of Isandlwana, Durnford was portrayed by Burt Lancaster.

<text>In radiometry, irradiance is the radiant flux &quot;received&quot; by a &quot;surface&quot; per unit area. The SI unit of irradiance is the watt per square metre (symbol Wâmâ2 or W/m2). The CGS unit erg per square centimetre per second (ergâcmâ2âsâ1) is often used in astronomy. Irradiance is often called intensity, but this term is avoided in radiometry where such usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity. In astrophysics, irradiance is called &quot;radiant flux&quot;.

Spectral irradiance is the irradiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The two forms have different dimensions and units: spectral irradiance of a frequency spectrum is measured in watts per square metre per hertz (Wâmâ2âHzâ1), while spectral irradiance of a wavelength spectrum is measured in watts per square metre per metre (Wâmâ3), or more commonly watts per square metre per nanometre (Wâmâ2ânmâ1).

==Mathematical definitions==
===Irradiance===
Irradiance of a surface, denoted &quot;E&quot;e (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as
:formula_1
where
*â is the partial derivative symbol;
*Î¦e is the radiant flux received;
*&quot;A&quot; is the area.

The radiant flux &quot;emitted&quot; by a surface is called radiant exitance.

===Spectral irradiance===
Spectral irradiance in frequency of a surface, denoted &quot;E&quot;e,Î½, is defined as
:formula_2
where &quot;Î½&quot; is the frequency.

Spectral irradiance in wavelength of a surface, denoted &quot;E&quot;e,Î», is defined as
:formula_3
where &quot;Î»&quot; is the wavelength.

==Property==
Irradiance of a surface is also, according to the definition of radiant flux, equal to the time-average of the component of the Poynting vector perpendicular to the surface:
:formula_4
where
* is the time-average;
*S is the Poynting vector;
*&quot;Î±&quot; is the angle between a unit vector normal to the surface and S.

For a propagating &quot;sinusoidal&quot; linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave, the Poynting vector always points to the direction of propagation while oscillating in magnitude. The irradiance of a surface is then given by
:formula_5
where
*&quot;E&quot;m is the amplitude of the wave&#x27;s electric field;
*&quot;n&quot; is the refractive index of the medium of propagation;
*&quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum;

* Î¼0 is the vacuum permeability;

*Îµ0 is the vacuum permittivity;
**formula_6
**formula_7 is the impedance of free space.

This formula assumes that the magnetic susceptibility is negligible; i.e. that &quot;Î¼&quot;r â 1 (&quot;Î¼&quot; â Î¼0) where &quot;Î¼&quot;r is the relative magnetic permeability of the propagation medium. This assumption is typically valid in transparent media in the optical frequency range.

==Point source==
A point source of light produces spherical wavefronts. The irradiance in this case varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source.
:formula_8
where
* is the distance;
* is the radiant flux;
* is the surface area of a sphere of radius .

For quick approximations, this equation indicates that doubling the distance reduces irradiation to one quarter; or similarly, to double irradiation, reduce the distance to 71%.

In astronomy, stars are routinely treated as point sources even though they are much larger than the Earth. This is a good approximation because the distance from even a nearby star to the Earth is much larger than the star&#x27;s diameter. For instance, the irradiance of Alpha Centauri A (radiant flux: 1.5 Lâ, distance: 4.34 ly) is about 2.7 Ã 10â8 W/m2 on Earth.

==Solar irradiance==

The global irradiance on a horizontal surface on Earth consists of the direct irradiance &quot;E&quot;e,dir and diffuse irradiance &quot;E&quot;e,diff. On a tilted plane, there is another irradiance component, &quot;E&quot;e,refl, which is the component that is reflected from the ground. The average ground reflection is about 20% of the global irradiance. Hence, the irradiance &quot;E&quot;e on a tilted plane consists of three components:
:formula_9

The integral of solar irradiance over a time period is called &quot;solar exposure&quot; or &quot;insolation&quot;.

Average solar irradiance at the top of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/m2, but at surface irradiance is approximately 1000 W/m2 on a clear day.

<text>Chickenhawk (chicken hawk or chicken-hawk) is a political term used in the United States to describe a person who is a war hawk yet actively avoids or avoided military service when of age. In political usage, &quot;chickenhawk&quot; is a compound of &quot;chicken&quot; (meaning &#x27;coward&#x27;) and &quot;hawk&quot; from &quot;war hawk&quot; (meaning &#x27;someone who advocates war&#x27;). Generally, the implication is that chickenhawks lack bravery to participate in war themselves, preferring to ask others to support, fight, and die in an armed conflict.

==History==
The term war hawk developed early in American history as a term for one who advocates war. On one episode of the American television show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; that aired in 1970, Dan Rowan made the following joke:

Previously, the term war wimp was sometimes used, coined during the Vietnam War by Congressman Andrew Jacobs, a Marine veteran of the Korean War, to describe &quot;someone who promotes waging war or building up the tools of war but hid behind a college deferment or suddenly came up lame when the draft board whistled.&quot;

The 1983 bestselling book &quot;Chickenhawk&quot; was a memoir by Robert Mason about his service in the Vietnam War, in which he was a helicopter pilot. Mason used the word as a compound oxymoron to describe both his fear of combat (&quot;chicken&quot;) and his attraction to it (&quot;hawk&quot;).

==Commentary==
James Fallows identifies the rise of chickenhawks with the distancing of the American public from the military. He says that while most Americans had experience with the military by the end of World War II, having either served or known people who had, &quot;now the American military is exotic territory to most of the American public.&quot; He cites examples of popular media such as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; as many Americans&#x27; exposure to the military.

Critics of the term chickenhawk argue that the term is used as a form of whataboutism in place of arguments against military action. Matthew Yglesias describes it as &quot;a species of hypocrisy charge, a tempting rhetorical ploy that in practice proves almost nothing.&quot;

John Bolton, Donald Trump, Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich, and Ted Nugent are modern examples of those being called chickenhawks by critics.

== Research ==

According to a 2014 study, leaders who had military backgrounds but no combat experience were most likely to initiate conflicts and wars.

<doc id="556974" wikidata="Q1587154" url="?curid=556974" title="Rangeela (1995 film)">
<text>Rangeela () is a 1995 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film written, directed and co-produced by Ram Gopal Varma. It stars Aamir Khan, Urmila Matondkar and Jackie Shroff. The film was A. R. Rahman&#x27;s first Hindi film with an original score and soundtrack, as his previous Hindi releases were simultaneously shot in Tamil films.

&quot;Rangeela&quot; released on 8 September 1995, and proved to be a major box office success. The film received critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise directed towards the film&#x27;s soundtrack and Matondkar&#x27;s performance, thus proving to be a breakthrough for her. It was screened at the mainstream section of the International Film Festival of India. 

At the 41st Filmfare Awards, &quot;Rangeela&quot; received a leading 14 nominations, Best Film, Best Director (Varma), Best Actor (Khan) and Best Actress (Matondkar), and won 7 awards, including Best Supporting Actor (Shroff), Best Music Director (Rahman) and Special Jury Award (Asha Bhosle for &quot;Tanha Tanha&quot;).

== Plot ==
A street-toughened orphan by the name of Munna (Aamir Khan) is befriended by some kind folks, whose effervescent daughter Mili (Urmila Matondkar) soon grows to be his best buddy. Both gravitate toward the Mumbai movie industry. While Mili finds occupation as a movie extra, Munna earns his livelihood selling movie tickets in the black market.

Mili has ambitions of becoming an actress. Fortune glances her way when she dances her way into a movie star&#x27;s attention. This actor, Raj Kamal (Jackie Shroff), arranges for her to be auditioned for the heroine&#x27;s role in his upcoming film called &quot;Rangeela&quot;. Mili&#x27;s shortcomings amount to distractions, but thanks in no small way to Munna and Raj, she lands the role.

Raj and Munna both fall for Mili, but Mili is too busy making the movie to notice any of this. She starts spending a lot of time with Raj during the filming. Munna tries many times to tell Mili that he loves her, but he is unable to, or Raj gets in the way. Eventually, feeling inferior, Munna decides to leave Mili to Raj, who can give her a better life than he can. The matter is not resolved though, as Mili learns of this on the film&#x27;s opening night after reading the letter that Munna left for her. After learning that Munna is also leaving the town, she emotionally runs out of the function to find Munna. Raj is initially angry at Mili for leaving the function midway. Mili tells Raj that Munna has written in the letter that he loves her but has misunderstood their relationship and left the town for good. Raj is taken aback when Mili tearfully tells him that she too loves Munna and can&#x27;t think of a life without him. Having realized his mistake, Raj decides to reunite Mili and Munna. 

Mili and Raj manage to stop Munna midway. All the misunderstandings get cleared up. Finally, Mili and Munna reunite with a hug.

Ram Gopal Varma once loved a woman named Satya Polavarapu, who he claims did not love him back since she preferred a wealthier, better looking man; this inspired him to write &quot;Rangeela&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==


The soundtrack featured 7 songs composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Mehboob and an instrumental theme song. The audio was released in 14 May 1995 by Rahman&#x27;s mother Kareema. It is listed in almost all lists of best Bollywood soundtracks. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 32,00,000 units sold the soundtrack became the third highest-selling album of the year.

The soundtrack fetched Rahman two filmfare awards, Filmfare Award for Best Music Director and Filmfare R. D. Burman Award for New Music Talent. Mehboob got two nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist, for the tracks &quot;Kya Kare&quot; and &quot;Tanha Tanha&quot;. Swarnalatha, Shweta Shetty and Kavita Krishnamurthy were nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for their respective tracks.

Asha Bhosle received the Filmfare Special Award that year for her rendition of the song &quot;Tanha Tanha&quot;.

The song &quot;Yaaro Sun Lo Zara&quot; was originally composed for a Telugu film &quot;Super Police&quot; (1994) as &quot;Baabu Love Cheyyara&quot;. The soundtrack was also released in Tamil, with title &quot;Rangeela&quot; itself and lyrics penned by Vairamuthu. However, the reused track &quot;Yaaro Sun Lo Zara&quot; was not included in the Tamil version. The soundtrack rights are now acquired by Tips Music Company.

== Reception ==
&quot;Rangeela&quot; opened to critical acclaim and was declared a âblockbusterâ at the box office, grossing 33.4Â crore. It was also the fourth biggest grosser of 1995. Urmila Matondkar became an overnight sensation and a superstar. Her fame and star status were bolstered by hits like &quot;Tanha Tanha&quot; and &quot;Rangeela Re&quot;. The costume designer of the film Manish Malhotra also received instant fame. The film proved to be a turning point for Khan&#x27;s career, whose chemistry with Urmila was also appreciated. The choreography of &quot;Rangeela&quot; also deserves a special mention. The amazing dance sequences led by choreographers Ahmed Khan and Saroj Khan were considered classic and appealing. &quot;Rangeela&quot;&#x27;s music was also highly successful and that helped the film achieve victory at the box office. Film&#x27;s music was noted for beating all time blockbuster &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; at almost all the award ceremonies. While Ahmed Khan took trophy for best choreographer for &quot;Rangeela Re&quot;, many critics and Saroj Khan herself considered that she should have won it for &quot;Tanha Tanha&quot;. Saroj Khan also had to battle with producers who showed her as guest choreographer in the movie credits, whereas she choreographed 4 songs.

== Cultural significance ==
Despite the film&#x27;s huge success, It was still regarded as a film ahead of its time as the films made during the early 1990s had dated plots and storylines. Shekhar Kapur called it &#x27;The film of the 21st Century with great music and visuals&#x27; at the screening of the film. The look and presentation of Urmila Matondkar in the film became the talk of the town as it re-invented the image of the Bollywood Heroine. Aamir Khan played an unusual character of a Mumbaiya Tapori and that proved to be the milestone for him. A. R. Rahman&#x27;s music of the film became such a rage that it topped the charts for almost a decade. The songs still remain popular as they have a fresh feel. The film established careers of so many technicians and the people who worked behind the camera.

<text>Steiff is a German-based plush toy company, founded in 1880, with headquarters in Giengen, Germany. The company claims to have made the world&#x27;s first factory-made teddy bear.

==History==

Steiff was founded in 1880 by Margarete Steiff, a seamstress. She began making fabric elephants that were sold in her shop as pincushions. However, children began playing with them, and in the years following she went on to design many other animal-themed toys for children, such as monkeys, donkeys, horses, camels, pigs, mice, dogs, cats, rabbits, and giraffes.

In 1893, Margarete&#x27;s felt fabric factory was founded in Giengen, Germany. In 1895, the first Steiff products to be sold outside Germany were sold at Harrods in London, England.

===Earliest Steiff teddy bears===

In 1897, Margarete&#x27;s nephew, Richard Steiff, joined the company and gave it an enormous boost by creating stuffed animals from drawings made at the zoo. Richard attended the School of Applied Arts in Stuttgart and studied in England. He designed the world&#x27;s first plush bear with movable arms and legs, known as &quot;55 PB&quot;.

In 1903, a 3,000-piece order was placed by a buyer in America after the &quot;teddy bear&quot; craze began due to a popular cartoon of President Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt and a young cub in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1902.

By 1907, Steiff manufactured 974,000 bears, and the company has been increasing its output ever since.

===Titanic teddy bears===

In 1912, in the aftermath of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster that left Britain in mourning, a British toy retailer ordered black Steiff teddy bears to bring comfort to the public. They did not sell very well and production was soon halted, with just 494 made in five different sizes. Today, they are highly coveted by collectors due to their historical relevance and scarcity.

===Company growth to present day===

In 1909, when Margarete died of pneumonia, Richard continued his aunt&#x27;s legacy and further expanded the toy and plush line. He also became the largest stockholder of the company.

In 1925, the Steiff company started using assembly line production to keep up with the high demand. In 1931, Steiff partnered with Disney to manufacture the well-known Disney characters.

By the 1960s, Steiff was known as the largest stuffed toy maker in the world. By 1968, according to &quot;Time&quot;, the company had 2,100 employees and generated $14 million annually.

In 1980, the Steiff Museum opened in Giengen. This event marked the 100th anniversary of the company. The museum has many artifacts from Margarete Steiff&#x27;s life.

In 2017, Steiff had revenues of â¬45 million, or $51 million according to the average exchange rate for the year.

===Luxury teddy bears===

In 2008, Steiff launched a limited-edition Karl Lagerfeld teddy bear with a price of â¬1,000. In 2018, Steiff and Tiffany &amp; Co. collaborated to offer a luxury teddy bear. The 10.5-inch, caramel-colored mohair teddy bear retailed for $375.

===Notable auctions===

Vintage Steiff teddy bears are prized by collectors, and depending on the type can bring significant sums at auction. In a 1994 auction, the Steiff &quot;Teddy Girl&quot; made in 1904 sold for a record $165,000.

In 2000, a Steiff Louis Vuitton Teddy Bear, with eyes made of sapphire and diamonds, and with gold parts, sold at an auction in Monaco for $2.1 million.

In May 2001, at a London Christie&#x27;s auction of vintage teddy bears, a pair of Steiff teddy bears made in 1908 went for sale with an estimated value of about $20,000.

In December 2002, &quot;Edwin&quot;, a -inch Steiff teddy bear that accompanied a British soldier, Percy Kynnersley-Baddlely, killed in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, was sold for Â£4,230.

In 2010, a 1925 Steiff Harlequin teddy bear sold at a London Christie&#x27;s auction for Â£46,850.

==Craftsmanship==

The Steiff company motto, as styled by Margarete Steiff, is &quot;Only the best is good enough for children&quot;. The company uses natural fibers such as mohair in their products. Steiff products are subject to meticulous testing and inspection. They are required to be highly flame resistant, and, among other things, smaller pieces such as eyes must be able to resist considerable tension, wear, and tear. A large amount of the work is done by hand. It takes eight to 12 months of training for a seamstress to develop the skills to make Steiff bears that meet the company&#x27;s strict quality standards.

The iconic &quot;button in ear&quot; tag was devised in 1904 by Margarete&#x27;s nephew Franz to keep counterfeits from being passed off as authentic Steiff toys. It is made of metal. The button is still used to distinguish authentic Steiff toys from fakes. The tag originally had the symbol of an elephant, and it was later replaced by the name &quot;Steiff&quot;.

<text>The University of Hull is a public research university in Kingston upon Hull, a city in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It was founded in 1927 as University College Hull. The main university campus is located in Hull and is home to the Hull York Medical School, a joint initiative with the University of York. Students are served by Hull University Union.

The first chancellor of the university was Lord Middleton (1954â1969), followed by Lord Cohen (1970â1977), Lord Wilberforce (1978â1994), Lord Armstrong (1994â2006) and Virginia Bottomley (Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone) (2006â2023). Alan Johnson was installed as the current chancellor in July 2023.

==History==

===University College===


The foundation stone of University College Hull, then an external college of the University of London, was laid in 1927 by Prince Albert, the Duke of York (who later became king as George VI). The college was built on land donated by Hull City Council and by two local benefactors, Thomas Ferens and G F Grant. A year later the first 14 departments, in pure sciences and the arts, opened with 39 students. The college at that time consisted of one building, now named the Venn building (after the mathematician John Venn, who was born in Hull). The building now houses the administrative centre of the university.

Other early buildings include the Cohen Building, which originally housed the college library, and Staff House, now named Canham Turner building, built in 1948 as the Students&#x27; Union. Another early structure was the Chemistry Building, built in 1953. With the rapid expansion of student numbers which took place in the 1950s many academic departments were housed in temporary buildings, colloquially known as &#x27;huts&#x27;, which gave the campus the feel of an &#x27;academic army camp&#x27;. The Dennison Centre on Cottingham Road was formerly the Brooklands Officers Hospital opened by the Red Cross in 1917. The author J. R. R. Tolkien was a convalescent patient at Brooklands and his connection is marked by a blue plaque.

Though many of the older buildings on Hull&#x27;s campus are of red brick it is not a &quot;redbrick university&quot; in the strictest sense of the term, as it was not founded as part of the civic university movement of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. Hull, with its origins in the 1920s, has been categorised as a &#x27;younger civic university&#x27; (also referred to as a &quot;Whitetile university&quot;) and it is placed between the &#x27;redbricks&#x27; and the &#x27;plateglass universities&#x27; founded in the 1960s.

The first principal of the college was Arthur E. Morgan (1926â1935), the second was John H Nicholson (1935â1954), who also served as the university&#x27;s first vice-chancellor when the college was granted university status (1954â1956).

====Coat of arms====
The university coat of arms was designed by Sir Algernon Tudor-Craig in 1928. The symbols are the torch for learning, the rose for Yorkshire, the ducal coronet from the arms of the City of Hull, the fleur-de-lys for Lincolnshire and the dove, symbolising peace, from the arms of Thomas Ferens. These symbols were later reused to create the current university logo. The motto, &quot;Lampada Ferens&quot; (Bearing the Torch), incorporates the name of the university&#x27;s founding father within a Latin pun.

===Royal charter===
The college gained its royal charter on 6 September 1954. This empowered it to award degrees of its own, making it the 3rd university in Yorkshire and the 14th in England. The twenty six years between the formation of the university college and the awarding of the charter were the shortest such period in the history of university formation in England up to that time. Within a year of the charter being granted applications to study at the new university had doubled, and in 1956 student numbers topped 1,000 for the first time.

===The mace===
The academic authority and autonomy of the university is symbolically embodied in the ceremonial mace. Made of gilt silver, and incorporating devices from the Hull University coat of arms, the mace was presented to the university in December 1956 by the Lord Mayor of Hull. As a gift from the city it also reflects the close relationship between &quot;town and gown&quot; existing in Hull. The mace is carried in procession and displayed at all major university ceremonies.

===Expansion in the 1950s and 1960s===

The period of rapid expansion of Hull University coincided with the vice-chancellorship of Sir Brynmor Jones (1956â1972), during whose time in office student numbers quadrupled.

The Brynmor Jones Library, which houses more than a million volumes, was constructed in two phases: the first phase was fully completed in 1959, with a tower block extension officially opened in 1970. Previously, the library had existed across two rooms in the Cohen Building, run by Agnes Cuming from its opening in 1929 until 1955. During the 1950s and 1960s a considerable number of academic buildings were built, including the Larkin and Wilberforce Buildings (originally given other names). The &#x27;Martin Plan&#x27; of 1967, Sir Leslie Martin was the university architect, envisaged a campus with its tallest buildings in the centre surrounded by buildings diminishing in height towards the perimeter. In the course of the 1960s most of the departments housed in temporary structures were moved into new purpose-built premises. However, Biochemistry was still partially located in a &#x27;hut&#x27; to the rear of the Venn building into the early 1980s. This early phase of expansion through building ended in 1974, after this year there was to be no further academic building construction on the campus until 1996. However, student numbers doubled in this period, with the university becoming highly efficient in using its existing building stock.

===Liquid crystal technology===
In 1972 George Gray and Ken Harrison created room-temperature stable liquid crystals in the university chemistry laboratories, which were an immediate success in the electronics industry and consumer products. This led to Hull becoming the first university to be awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement for the joint-development of the long-lasting materials that made liquid crystal displays possible.

===Expansion in the 21st century===
In 2000 the university bought the site of University College Scarborough on Filey Road, Scarborough, plus two linked buildings on the same road. This became the University of Hull Scarborough Campus.

A further significant expansion took place in 2003, when the buildings of the former Humberside University campus, which were situated immediately adjacent to Hull University&#x27;s main campus, were purchased. The acquisition increased the size of the Cottingham Road campus by more than a third. It was the largest single act of expansion in the history of the university. Hull University fully occupied the newly acquired premises in the 2005 academic year; the area becoming the university&#x27;s West Campus. The site now houses the Hull York Medical School and the relocated business school, which is located in three of the most prominent buildings â Wharfe, Derwent and Esk.

In 2012, the university began the ambitious refurbishment of the Brynmor Jones Library, a Â£28Â million project which will transform the 7 storey former workplace of Philip Larkin, into a learning hub suitable for students for years to come. The project was completed in 2015.

===Hull History Centre===
The Hull History Centre, which opened in 2010, is located in a new building on Worship Street in Hull city centre. It unites the holdings of Hull City Library&#x27;s Local Studies collections and Hull University&#x27;s archives and is run in partnership between the City Library and University Library.

===City of Culture 2017===

The university was a principal partner of the city&#x27;s bid to become UK City of Culture in 2017. As well as being involved in the planning and preparation of the bid, the university and its staff and students have been involved in many of the events of the year. For example, during the initial three-month season, Hull Maritime Museum displayed a multimedia installation depicting a Bowhead whale The installation was designed by students from Hull School of Art and Design with music by students from Hull University. The opening event of the whole year, from 1â7 January, included a multimedia projection called &quot;Arrivals and Departures&quot; which was greatly influenced by the work of Dr Nick Evans on migration patterns into and through Hull. The installation was projected onto The Deep using stop-frame animation, image and sound.

=== Staff cuts and restructuring ===
In June 2024, University of Hull Vice-Chancellor Professor David Petley announced plans to cut up to 150 jobs (14% of the workforce) in response to a reduction in international student applications. The number of redundancies was later reduced to 127.

In November 2024, it was announced that the university would close its chemistry department and that the number of schools would be reduced from 17 to 11.

==Campuses==

The main campus is located in a residential district of North Hull on Cottingham Road. The university had a smaller campus in Scarborough on the North Yorkshire coast.

Hull University is a campus university; though situated in a city, its main campus is in a suburban rather than urban district. The main campus occupies a single, clearly defined site and is self-contained in regard to catering and entertainment for students and staff. Most of the major features of the campus are described in the &#x27;history&#x27; section above; in addition, the campus has a large Students&#x27; Union building, which is often described as one of the finest in the country, and extensive playing fields and other sports facilities. The large village of Cottingham on Hull&#x27;s north-western outskirts housed for many years some of the university-owned student accommodation, although none are used for this purpose now.

=== London Study Centre ===
In May 2024, the University of Hull, in collaboration with the Cambridge Education Group, inaugurated the London Study Centre, offering students the opportunity to pursue University of Hull programmes in the capital. Located in Bloomsbury, central London, the Centre initially provides a selection of business-focused postgraduate programmes, including MSc Business Management MSc Logistics and Supply Chain Management MSc Digital Marketing and Advertising.

===University College Scarborough===
University of Hull: Scarborough Campus was a satellite campus of the university located in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, attended by approximately 2,000 students. Formerly a higher education institution offering BSc and BA degrees, the building was acquired by the University of Hull in 2000, offering Education courses, particularly at a primary level, as well as courses in Marine Biology, Digital Media, Music Technology Theatre Studies, Tourism Management, and a number of Business and English courses.

Scarborough ran somewhat independently of the main campus in Hull, with its own branch of the Hull University Union. Graduation ceremonies took place within Scarborough&#x27;s historic Spa Complex. The campus also contained basic amenities for study, such as computer labs, performance studios for students of Theatre and Dance related courses as well as dedicated music suites in the &quot;Filey Road Studios&quot; building opposite the campus.

In April 2014, the university released a statement that Scarborough Campus was &quot;not sustainable in the medium to long term&quot;, and in June held a public consultation outlining the future of the campus with a new academic model in mind. In March 2015, it was revealed that the Hull College Group were the university&#x27;s &quot;preferred partners for taking forward the Scarborough Campus&quot;. The college returned to its former name, &quot;University College Scarborough&quot; and became part of the Hull College group, but still hosts programmes from both Hull College and the University of Hull.

===External Validation===
Since September 2013, all undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses at the Leeds Conservatoire are validated by the University of Hull. Beginning in 1993 Hull has validated Masters of Education programmes for the Christian Leadership in Education Office (CLEO), in Cork (and from 1993 to 1996 in Limerick), Ireland. Hull also validates a number of programmes in Rotherham College, Dearne Vally College, and other RNN Group locations.
From 1972 until 1982 the University of Hull validated programmes at the postrgaduate Irish School of Ecumenics.

==Student life==

===Students&#x27; Union===

Hull University Union is the main provider of student catering, services and entertainment on the university campus. It has over 100 student societies affiliated to it, and also runs a volunteering and charity hub. Approximately 50 sports clubs are affiliated to the Students Union&#x27;s Athletic Union, many of which compete in BUCS national university leagues. The University Union was voted Students&#x27; Union of the Year in July 2012.

The student union building comprises an on-site nightclub as well as a number of bars and catering outlets. The building also houses a shop, advice centre, and the university-run careers service.

There is a monthly student newspaper called &quot;The Hullfire&quot;, an online television station called Hullfire TV and a student radio station which broadcasts from the union building called JAM Radio which relaunched in 2018.

===Student accommodation===
The university has three main halls of residence on campus:

* Taylor Court is located next to the Wilberforce building and houses 288 students in en-suite rooms with shared kitchens.
* The Courtyard opened in 2016 and is situated next to the Student Union, it houses 562 students in en-suite rooms as well as some rooftop apartments.
* Westfield Court partially opened in 2018, with a full opening in 2019 on the site of the former medical school. It houses a total of 1462 students in a mix of single and cluster flats.

In the recent past there were halls of residence in Cottingham at The Lawns, seven halls which could hold around 1,000 students. In March 2019 it was announced that The Lawns would close. Historically, the main concentration of &#x27;traditional&#x27; (catered) university halls of residence was in Cottingham. These comprised: Cleminson Hall (closed in 2004), Needler Hall (closed in 2016), and Thwaite Hall (closed in 2017). Ferens Hall was originally a traditional hall, but was later amalgamated with the adjoining Lawns halls. Prior to the mid-1980s, Cleminson and Thwaite halls were exclusively for female residents, Needler and Ferens exclusively for male residents. There was a former on-campus student residence, Loten Hall (now known as the Loten Building).

Student housing is based primarily in the terraced streets around the university campus itself, as well as around the Newland Avenue and Beverley Road areas of the city.

<doc id="556981" wikidata="Q967017" url="?curid=556981" title="SMART criteria">
<text>S.M.A.R.T. (or SMART) is an acronym used as a mnemonic device to establish criteria for effective goal-setting and objective development. This framework is commonly applied in various fields, including project management, employee performance management, and personal development. The term was first proposed by George T. Doran in the November 1981 issue of &quot;Management Review&quot;, where he advocated for setting objectives that are specific (or Simple), measurable, assignable, realistic, and time-boundâhence the acronym S.M.A.R.T. 

Since its inception, the SMART framework has evolved, leading to the emergence of different variations of the acronym. Commonly used versions incorporate alternative words, including &quot;attainable&quot;, &quot;relevant&quot;, and &quot;timely&quot;. Additionally, several authors have introduced supplementary letters to the acronym. For instance, some refer to SMARTS goals, which include the element of &quot;self-defined&quot;, while others utilize SMARTER goals.

Proponents of SMART objectives argue that these criteria facilitate a clear framework for goal setting and evaluation, applicable across various contexts such as business (between employee and employer) and sports (between athlete and coach). This framework enables the individual setting the goal to have a precise understanding of the expected outcomes, while the evaluator has concrete criteria for assessment. The SMART acronym is linked to Peter Drucker&#x27;s management by objectives (MBO) concept, illustrating its foundational role in strategic planning and performance management.

==History==
In the November 1981 issue of &quot;Management Review&quot; (AMA Forum), George T. Doran&#x27;s paper titled &quot;There&#x27;s a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management&#x27;s goals and objectives&quot; introduces a framework for setting management objectives, emphasizing the importance of clear goals. The S.M.A.R.T. criteria he proposes are as follows:

* &quot;Specific(simple):&quot; Targeting a particular area for improvement
* &quot;Measurable:&quot; Quantifying, or at least suggesting, an indicator of progress
* &quot;Assignable:&quot; Defining responsibility clearly
* &quot;Realistic(relative):&quot; Outlining attainable results with available resources
* &quot;Time-related:&quot; Including a timeline for expected results

Doran clarifies that it&#x27;s not always feasible to quantify objectives at all management levels, particularly for middle-management roles. He argues for the value in balancing quantifiable objectives with more abstract goals to formulate a comprehensive action plan. This emphasizes the integration of objectives with their execution plans as the foundation of effective management.

==Common usage==
S.M.A.R.T. goals and objectives are key concepts in planning and project management. The acronym, while consistently used, applies differently to goals and objectives. Goals define the broad outcomes intended from a project or assignment, and objectives specify the actionable steps aimed at achieving these outcomes. There is acknowledgment of some variation in the application of the framework, reflecting a range of interpretations in practice. 
== Effectiveness ==
Research suggests that the effectiveness of the SMART goal-setting framework can vary depending on the context in which it is applied, indicating that its universal application might not always yield effective outcomes.

=== Career goals ===
A Michigan State University Extension study highlighted the effectiveness of the SMART goal-setting approach. It showed that individuals who wrote down their goals and outlined action steps had a 76% success rate in achieving them, especially when they shared weekly updates with a friend. This was compared to a 43% success rate for those who didn&#x27;t document their goals, indicating an advantage to the structured approach of SMART goal-setting.

=== Physical activity ===
A review of literature indicates mixed effectiveness of the SMART acronym for increasing physical activity. Criticisms focus on its lack of scientific basis and empirical support, suggesting non-specific, open-ended goals might be more beneficial for some individuals. Research indicates that vague or challenging goals could be more effective than specific ones for increasing physical activity. Swann et al. highlight the original SMART framework&#x27;s absence of theoretical or empirical foundation, contrasting with broader goal-setting research.

==Variations==
The SMART framework has been expanded by some authors to include additional criteria, enhancing its versatility and application. Examples of these extensions are:

*SMARTER
**Evaluated and reviewed
**Evaluate consistently and recognize mastery
**Exciting and Recorded 
*SMARTIE
**Equity and inclusion
*SMARTTA
**Trackable and agreed
*SMARTA
**agreed
*SMARRT
**Realistic and relevance â &#x27;Realistic&#x27; refers to something that can be done given the available resources. &#x27;Relevance&#x27; ensures the goal is in line with the bigger picture and vision.
*I-SMART
**A social goal or objective which demonstrates &quot;Impact&quot;

==Alternative acronyms==
Other mnemonic acronyms (or contractions) also give criteria to guide in the setting of objectives.

<text>[[Archery]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] was held at Sydney International Archery Park in Sydney, Australia with ranking rounds on 16 September and regular competition held from 17 to 20 September. One hundred twenty-eight archers from forty-six nations competed in the four gold medal eventsâindividual and team events for men and for womenâthat were contested at these games.

The Korean team won three out of the four gold medals contested. Eight Olympic records and three world records were broken at these games.

==Qualification and format==
There were four ways for National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to qualify berths for individual archers for the Olympics in archery. No NOC was allowed to enter more than three archers. For each gender, the host nation (Australia) was guaranteed three spots. The 1999 World Target Competition&#x27;s top 8 teams (besides the host nation) each received three spots, and the 19 highest ranked archers after the team qualifiers were removed also received spots. 15 of the remaining 18 spots were divided equally among the five Olympic continents for allocation in continental tournaments. The last three spots in each gender were determined by the Tripartite Commission.

Each NOC that received three places for individual archers (i.e., the host nation, the top 8 teams at the World Target Competition, and any other nation that was able to take 3 of the remaining 37 places) was able to have its three archers compete as a team in the team competition.

All archery at the 2000 Olympics was done from a range of 70 meters. The target consists of concentric circles, and has a total diameter of 122Â cm. An archer had 40 seconds to shoot each arrow. 64 archers in each gender took part in the Olympics, with each National Olympic Committee being able to enter a maximum of three archers. Each archer shot 12 ends, or groups, of 6 arrows per end in the ranking round. The score from that round determined the match-ups in the elimination rounds, with high-ranking archers facing low-ranking archers. There were three rounds of elimination that used six ends of three arrows, narrowing the field of archers to 32, then to 16, then to 8. The three final rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) each used four ends of three arrows.

== Participating nations ==

Forty six nations contributed archers to compete in the events. Below is a list of the competing nations; in parentheses are the number of national competitors.

<doc id="556988" wikidata="Q939008" url="?curid=556988" title="Exit Planet Dust">
<text>Exit Planet Dust is the debut studio album by English electronic music duo the Chemical Brothers. It was first released on 26 June 1995 in the United Kingdom by Junior Boy&#x27;s Own, Freestyle Dust, and Virgin Records, and on 15 August 1995 in the United States by Astralwerks. The album was recorded between August and November 1994, with &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; performed live. Its title is a reference to their departure from their earlier name the Dust Brothers.

The album received critical acclaim and was in the UK charts for many weeks, charting in each year from its release in 1995 until 2000; its highest peak was number 9 in 1995.

==Background==

Their initial work included a remix of an Ariel song (a band which included Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers on drums), released under their &#x27;237 Turbo Nutters&#x27; name, and the track &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, issued as an independent single on Diamond Records, reportedly inspired by a nickname Ed Simons had. The single also contained two longform remixes of the track. The band took the song to various dance record shops around London but no one picked it up. &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; was made simply using a Hitachi hi-fi system, an Atari ST, a sampler, and a keyboard, using a sample of This Mortal Coil.

Andrew Weatherall of the Sabres of Paradise had heard the track. He decided to play it live in his DJ sets and suggested Steven Hall sign the duo to Junior Boy&#x27;s Own record label, which re-released the single in 1993. The band had become popular remixers, mixing tracks ranging from &quot;Jailbird&quot; by Primal Scream to &quot;Voodoo People&quot; by the Prodigy (their remix of this particular track also became the A-side of &quot;Voodoo People&quot; on select versions).

==Recording==

The album&#x27;s recording began in August 1994 and concluded in November. Tom Rowlands stated in 2002 that they &quot;stayed up for three weeks making it&quot;. One song from the sessions, &quot;Leave Home&quot;, was first released in late 1994 on the duo&#x27;s mix album, &quot;NME Xmas Dust Up&quot;, released as a covermount cassette tape in an issue of &quot;NME&quot;. The first six tracks on &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; are continuous, making a medley. These six tracks include &quot;Leave Home&quot;; and edits of the duo&#x27;s previous songs &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; and their first track &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, the latter being recorded live on the album from Sabresonic nightclub in March 1994, which belonged to Weatherall&#x27;s act the Sabres of Paradise, who also remixed &quot;Leave Home&quot;.

The duo became resident DJs at the smallâbut hugely influentialâHeavenly Sunday Social Club at the Albany pub in London&#x27;s Great Portland Street at this point. The likes of Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller, James Dean Bradfield, and Tim Burgess were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers (as they were known at the time) were subsequently asked to remix tracks by Manic Street Preachers and the Charlatans.

The album was finished by 1995 and released on the Junior Boy&#x27;s Own label, in conjunction with the Chemical Brothers&#x27; own independent leg of that label, Freestyle Dust; and Virgin Records, which later replaced Junior Boy&#x27;s Own as the band&#x27;s head label. The duo, however, had to change their name to the Chemical Brothers after the American production duo Dust Brothers had threatened to sue them if they refused to. The Chemical Brothers name came from the duo&#x27;s track &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;. The name change inspired the name of the album.

== Content ==
===Samples===

The beginning of &quot;Leave Home&quot; is a short sample of the beginning of the Kraftwerk song &quot;Ohm Sweet Ohm&quot; from the album &quot;Radio-Activity&quot;. Also sampled are percussion sections from Pucho &amp; His Latin Soul Brothers&#x27; &quot;Got Myself a Good Man&quot; and vocals from &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; by Blake Baxter (1992), as well as short samples from &quot;The Defector&quot; by Recoil. &quot;In Dust We Trust&quot; contains several short samples of the Beastie Boys song &quot;The Maestro&quot; from the album &quot;Check Your Head&quot;. The vocal sample in &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; is a reversed sample of part of the Dead Can Dance track &quot;Song of Sophia&quot; from the album &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot;. &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; also samples drums from &quot;God O.D.&quot; by Meat Beat Manifesto.

===Artwork===

The cover of the album was from a 1970s fashion shoot reject box, according to Ed Simons. In a 1995 interview with &quot;Select&quot; magazine, Simons said, &quot;We wanted something that just looked nice. A lot of techno albums just have fractals on them, and we wanted something a bit more romantic and otherworldly with soft, nice colours. It&#x27;s the wrong way round as well - intentionally. If me and Tom are in that picture we&#x27;re in the car going, &quot;Oh she&#x27;s alright, I wish I had a guitar on my back with her.&quot; That would rank as one of the good things in life. Originally we had this pregnant woman in a field wearing this white see-though dress, like a Flake advert gone wrong. But we couldn&#x27;t use it because the unborn child could have sued us&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said that the people on the cover &quot;are presumably travelling, but are content on making their own wayâcontent travellers in a picturesque setting.&quot; Another image from the same fashion photo shoot was used as one of the images in the &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; booklet.

The reference to &quot;the kids from Orlando&quot; in the liner thank you notes is a reference to the duo&#x27;s first performance in the United States, at The Edge nightclub in Orlando, Florida on 4 July 1993. The LP features a series of messages on the run-out grooves. One of them, &quot;Huw is innocent!&quot; on side four, apparently refers to Rowlands&#x27; brother. This message would later be referenced on the LP of &quot;Push the Button&quot; (2005), where the side four run-out message claims &quot;Huw is still innocent!&quot;

== Release ==

The album was released in the UK in June 1995. Shortly before its release, Ed Simons said to &quot;Muzik&quot; that &quot;nobody from the dance world has come up with an album to reflect these times. Why is that? Why is it left to a group like Oasis to express the way that young people want to go out and get battered every weekend? That&#x27;s what The Chemical Brothers are about&quot;.

&quot;Leave Home&quot; was released as the first official single from the album on 5 June 1995. It reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; was released as the second single on 28 August 1995 and reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart.

The album was certified platinum by the BPI on 1 January 1996. On 30 October 2000, the album was released on MiniDisc. In 2004, the album was packaged with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; in a limited edition box set as part of EMI&#x27;s &quot;2CD Originals&quot; collection.

== Reception ==
&quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; received praise upon release. &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;brash, raw, rule-bending gear made by open-minded music fans, for open-minded music fans.&quot;

The album has received retrospective acclaim and continues to inspire. &quot;Muzik&quot; named it the second best dance album of all time in 2002 and Q TV named it the 41st best album of the 1990s. AllMusic&#x27;s top-marks review states &quot;The Chemical Brothers&#x27; sound is big on bombast, replete with screeching guitar samples and lots of sirens and screaming divas. A breakthrough album of sorts, &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; was, upon its release, one of the few European post-techno albums to make any sort of headway into the stateside market.&quot;

Following the album&#x27;s release, the duo were thanked in the liner notes of &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; by Fatboy Slim and &quot;Homework&quot; by Daft Punk. Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described the former album as &quot;one of the first albumsâand probably the best, outside of the Chems&#x27; own later materialâto take the rough template of [&quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;] as a direct model.&quot; The Edge also named it his favourite album of 1995.

The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Stereogum&quot; did a review in 2015, 20 years after the album release and called it one of the &quot;best psychedelic rock records of the &#x27;90s.&quot;
