==History==
The first settlers in what was to become Estevan arrived in 1892, along with the expansion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was incorporated as a village in 1899, and later became a town in 1906.

<doc id="555165" wikidata="Q5423293" url="?curid=555165" title="Ezili Dantor">
<text>Èzili Dantò or Erzulie Dantor is the main loa (or &quot;lwa&quot;) or senior spirit of the Petro family in Haitian Vodou. Ezili Danto, or Èzili Dantò, is the &quot;manifestation of Erzulie, the divinity of love.&quot; It is said that Ezili Danto has a dark complexion and is maternal in nature. The Ezili are feminine spirits in Haitian Vodou that personify womanhood. The Erzulie is a goddess, spirit, or loa of love in Haitian Voudou. She has several manifestations or incarnations, but most prominent and well-known manifestations are Lasirenn (the mermaid), Erzulie Freda, and Erzulie Dantor. There are spelling variations of Erzulie, the other being Ezili. They are English interpretations of a Creole word, but do not differ in meaning.

==Worship== 
Tuesdays are the days reserved to worship Ezili Dantor. Worship is normally done in solitary in front of an altar identified by the colors blue, black and red. The most recurrent offering consist of crème de cacao, jewels, golden rings and florida water. For her birthday a wild pig is normally the main sacrifice.

== Haitian mythology ==
In Haitian mythology, there are multiple spiritual entities, or lwa, that work between the mortal world and the divine world. Ezili are feminine spirits that personify different aspects of womanhood. Ezili Freda is a Rada Loa who represents romantic love and erotic sexuality, while Ezili Dantor is Petro and represents the hardworking and sometimes angry mother, although she is also known to take on lovers of her own. Ezili Dantor is believed to have children of her own in some stories, such as Ti-Jean Petwo, and is a fervid protector of the youth and the marginalized.

Ezilí Freda is Dantor&#x27;s rival and is said to be responsible for leaving scars on Dantor&#x27;s cheek – known as &quot;twa màk&quot;– during a fight over the love of Ogou, according to some legends. Another distinction between them is that Freda is traditionally light-skinned (though this has begun to shift in devotional art) and relatively wealthy, indicative of her status as an upper-class woman. Thus, Ezili Dantor strongly resonates with lower class women in Haitian society. People may often petition her to help them get work. Ezili Dantor is also associated with the &quot;masisi&quot;, transgender women and effeminate men.

Other stories in the religion note that Èzili Dantò is nonspeaking as a result of her tongue being cut out by other Haitian Revolutionaries who feared she would betray them. Èzili Dantò only utters syllables during possession because of this, and is capable of becoming extremely angry and vengeful, to the point that she is considered evil, though she is not inherently so. Other adherents believe she does not speak because she is too angry and exhausted to do so from having to work hard and gaining so little. Her daughter, Anais, often interprets for her, and may be contacted to pass on messages.

Dantor&#x27;s anger has the power to destroy, and her vehement displeasure has earned her the reputation of being the red eyed, &quot;Èzili Je Wouj&quot;. Her destructive powers often come in the form of natural disasters and the forces of nature. Her rage is even said to be able to afflict those who anger her with extremely painful illnesses. Ezili Je Wouj is also sometimes considered a separate figure. In Zora Neale Hurston’s &quot;Haiti&quot; and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God,&quot; Ezili&#x27;s Danto&#x27;s rage is described as &quot;violent reminder to the folk that their passive faith in Euro-Americans, or Christianity, to determine their fate is misguided.&quot;

Ultimately, Ezili Dantor &quot;rages and destroys, but she also suffers&quot;, known to be associated with fertility problems women experience, including aphasia. However, at heart, Ezili Dantor is a devoted and selfless mother, willing to do all that is possible to protect those she loves and cares for, even &quot;turn the world upside down&quot;. Those who venerate Dantor are expected to serve her with the same undying loyalty in return, as well as caution.

==Dantor and the Haitian Revolution==

It is accounted that the slave revolt of 1791 started with a pact which followed a big feast in honour to Ezili Dantor. For this reason she is considered the national Lwa. Considered to be a fearless warrior in the Petro Nation (&quot;Petwo Nanchon&quot; in Haitian Creole), Dantor has been popular among single mothers during the 1980s and 1990s in Haiti and Dominican Republic.

Syncretic modern representations of Dantor sometimes associate her with the Mater Salvatoris, especially those depicted with children; Our Lady of Lourdes and Our Lady of Mount Carmel as examples. The most common association however, is the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, the patron saint of Poland. 

The original association of Ezili Dantor with the Black Madonna of Częstochowa is hypothesized to be from copies of the icon brought to Haiti by Polish soldiers sent by order of Napoleon Bonaparte, to subdue the then still ongoing Haitian Revolution. It is accounted that the Polish legion saw the struggle of the Polish nation during the Partitions of Poland in the struggle of the Haitian slaves in fights for their freedom, and as a result the Polish soldiers eventually turned on the French army to join the Haitian slaves. As a consequence of this action, during Jean-Jacques Dessalines&#x27;s 1804 massacre, which took place shortly after the Haitian victory; the Poles were left alive and granted citizenship of the newly-founded Republic of Haiti. The descendants of these soldiers are still living in the island, specifically in the locality of Cazale.

===Books===

*The 2013 novel &quot;Zora Neale Hurston, Haiti, and Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; is a collection of ten (10) essays from various authors that break down and analyze the literary work of Zora Neale Hurston, and her 1937 novel &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God.&quot; Hurston&#x27;s stories follow a light-skinned woman by the name of Janie Crawford. Hurston writes the character of Janie with characteristics that resemble Ezili Freda, but that both Freda and Danto live within her. Janie falls in love with and marries a dark-skinned man named Tea Cake but must show him that she is not above working in the fields like other working-class folk. By working in the fields, Janie shows that she is not afraid of hard work, is mature, and embraces Ezili Danto. 

*In the &quot;Mambo Reina Series&quot; by Veronica G. Henry, the main character is a Mambo who is dedicated to Erzulie.

===Music===

*Paul Beaubrun performed a song dedicated to Ezili on his album &quot;Ayibobo&quot;.
* &quot;Ezili&quot; – (from the album &quot;Potomitan&quot;) is a song written by Sélène Saint-Aimé a French-Caribbean contrabass player, vocalist and poet.

The title refers to the festival of religious and cultural practices held on the station. Showrunner J. Michael Straczynski explained, &quot;A parliament is a gathering of representatives, in this case the representatives of various belief systems; the dreams are the religions themselves.&quot;

==Plot==
The Earth Alliance arranges a week-long festival of religious and cultural exchange on Babylon 5. The Centauri celebrate with a lavish party, commemorating the victory of the Centauri over the other sentient life on their world, the Xon. At the end of each year, they look around and count how many of them survived and they celebrate their good fortune (rather than mourn those who have been killed). The Minbari host a session of prayers, a rebirth ceremony wherein the &quot;old&quot; self is &quot;killed&quot; and a new and better one is reborn.

A courier brings word to the Narn ambassador, G&#x27;Kar that an old political rival of his, Du&#x27;Rog, is arranging to have him assassinated. A paranoid G&#x27;Kar first suspects his new diplomatic attache, Na&#x27;Toth, but learns too late that the true assassin is the courier himself, the Thenta Makur member Tu&#x27;Pari. Shortly after, Tu&#x27;Pari begins subjecting G&#x27;Kar to a torture session mandated by terms of the assassination contract. Na&#x27;Toth discovers the assassin and intervenes, beating G&#x27;Kar in order to appear allied with Tu&#x27;Pari, but in actuality, deactivating the torture-inducing binds. G&#x27;Kar then easily captures Tu&#x27;Pari and then arranges for him to remain unconscious until his commission&#x27;s deadline has passed, and depositing a large sum of money in his account to make it look like he was bribed into violating his commitment. Since the guild penalty for that is death, G&#x27;Kar and Na&#x27;Toth encourage him – with relish – to flee.

Jeffrey Sinclair meets an old flame, Catherine Sakai, and rekindles their on-off romantic relationship, before hosting a celebration of Earth religion in which he introduces the major station personnel to a line of people, all of different faiths (starting with an atheist)—the line extends some distance all the way to the final credits.

==Production, visual and sound effects ==
===Cast and filming===
This episode featured two guest artists: Thomas Kopachel played Narn assassin Tu&#x27;Pari, while Julia Nickson played the role of Catherine Sakai. Two regular characters, Lennier and Na&#x27;Toth, were also introduced.

Minbari diplomatic aide Lennier, was played by Bill Mumy, who as a child actor had played Will Robinson in the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; television series. Straczynski described his performance:

Narn diplomatic aide Na&#x27;Toth was played by actress and musician Julie Caitlin Brown. Following the departure from the series of Mary Woronov – the actress who had played G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s previous aide, Ko&#x27;Dath – Susan Kellermann had been cast as Na&#x27;Toth. Kellerman withdrew after difficulties with the heavy alien prosthetics, throwing the filming schedule into disarray. Producer Douglas Netter got on the phone in an attempt to get a replacement actress, and by lunchtime of that day, he had secured Brown as a replacement.

Brown sat down with Straczynski, asking who the character was to him, and then came up with a portrayal to suit Na&#x27;Toth. The fighting scenes involving Na&#x27;Toth had already been filmed using a stunt double. However, Brown persuaded the production team to reshoot the sequences using her, instead of the double, saying that scenes filmed with a double result in a product where it can obviously be seen that it isn&#x27;t the main actor. Brown got carried away during the sequences involving high kicks, and accidentally kicked the camera whilst filming.

Andreas Katsulas, who played G&#x27;Kar opposite Brown said, &quot;She took it all on, and [the prosthetics] can be so disconcerting. Suddenly, someone who&#x27;s very animated can become very withdrawn because they feel they can&#x27;t move. She went with it, and we had good chemistry. She knew she needed something strong to work with me.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s character Na&#x27;Toth would be played by Mary Kay Adams in season 2; however, Brown reprised the role in season 5.

During the episode, Sinclair is listening to &quot;Ulysses&quot; by Tennyson. Sinclair had previous quoted the same poem in &quot;The Gathering&quot;, and lines from the poem appear in future seasons.

The final scene where Sinclair introduces a long line of Earth people, followers of different religions, was filmed with 160 extras on October 16, 1993. Straczynski indicated that of the characters in the line, some extras were actually who they appeared to be, and some weren&#x27;t. The actor playing the Jewish rabbi was actually a biker with tattoos all over his arms. Actor Michael O&#x27;Hare only had half an hour to memorise the list of names. As he was raised as a Catholic, he made the second one a Catholic priest with the name Father Chrisanti, named after his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Straczynski wrote,

===Makeup and Emmy Award===
The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for this episode.

Makeup for the series was provided by Optic Nerve Studios, a company founded by John Vulich and Everett Burrell, in a garage in Granada Hills, California, in 1989. Their vision was to do makeup &quot;with an eye towards new ideas technology&quot;. Vulich and Burrell had been contacted by &quot;Babylon 5&quot; producer John Copeland, as they had known Ron Thornton, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;&#x27;s visual effects designer, from their previous involvement with NewTek and Video Toaster.

Most of the alien prosthetics had been originally designed by Steve Burg for the pilot episode. Vulich and Burrell got together a team and set about re-making some of the alien characters, beginning with Kosh, G&#x27;Kar, Londo and Delenn. They eventually created a huge stock library of aliens that were re-used throughout the season. Burrell wrote,

Filming for the series began in the summer of 1993. The makeup team&#x27;s schedule included custom make-ups for each episode, and producing face casts of actors for prosthetics which needed to be on camera in three days. Burrell wrote,

Burrell recalls finding out about their Emmy Award win:

===Visual effects===
For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with LightWave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

===Music===
Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race. The song which G&#x27;Kar sings in his quarters, while preparing his meal before the assassin Tu&#x27;Pari arrives, was specifically written by Franke for this episode.

==Writing==
As &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was conceived with an overall five-year story arc, the episode was written as both an individual story and with another level, where the hints of the larger story arc were given. The series&#x27; creator, J. Michael Straczynski indicates that the episodes can be watched for the individual stories, the character stories, or the story arc.

The script for this episode juggles three different storylines and introduces two new members of the cast, Lennier and Na&#x27;Toth, in addition to introducing the recurring character Catherine Sakai. Straczynski writes,

==Reviews==
Rowan Kaiser writes in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;:

Kaiser writes that the final scene where Commander Sinclair introduces the alien ambassadors to hundreds of representatives of different Earth religions, is another demonstration of this transcendence and mystery, labelling it as &quot;one of the most memorable of the series.&quot;

Elias Rosner, writing in &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, singles out Julie Caitlin Brown&#x27;s performance as Na&#x27;Toth. He writes, &quot;From the second she&#x27;s on screen, is a breath of fresh air and Julie Caitlin Brown absolutely nails it ... Her wit is razor sharp and her delivery is just deadpan enough to be funny. She acts as a perfect foil to G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s flustered, prideful, energetic, and sometimes childish personality.&quot;

<doc id="555169" wikidata="Q10944670" url="?curid=555169" title="Mind War">
<text>&quot;Mind War&quot; is the sixth episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. The episode deals with the arrival on the station of a telekinetically-enhanced fugitive telepath fleeing from Psi Corps experimentation, and introduces the Psi Cop Alfred Bester, who leads the manhunt.

==Plot==
Jason Ironheart, Talia Winters&#x27; old instructor at Psi-Corps, arrives at Babylon 5, having recently evaded capture. Psi-Corps agents Alfred Bester and his assistant Kelsey arrive shortly thereafter, and meet with Sinclair, Ivanova, and Winters, warning them that Ironheart is aboard and they need to perform a manhunt for them. To verify that Winters has not yet met him, Bester and Kelsey put Winters under an intense mind probe, but find no contact. Sinclair asks Bester if there is any danger to the station from Ironheart, but Bester tells him not to worry.

Ironheart contacts Winters and asks her to visit. In his guest quarters, he explains that he is an advanced test subject from Psi-Corps, an attempt to raise the telepathic abilities of humans well beyond any known levels. The experimentation they performed on him gave him advanced telekinesis, for which he believes that Psi-Corps wants to use him as a secret assassin. However, his abilities are growing beyond his control, and as he speaks to Winters, he suffers a &quot;mind quake&quot;, shaking the nearby area violently. He begs Winters to leave, after which he creates a psychic barrier around his quarters and several sections around it. Alerted to the situation, Sinclair accosts Bester in lying to him because several people were wounded by the mind quake.

Some time later, Winters convinces Ironheart to let her in. Ironheart warns Talia that he cannot control his powers and must leave the station. Winters discreetly relays this to Sinclair, who agrees to meet with Ironheart; after hearing his story, Sinclair agrees to help him escape. He has security clear a path to the docking bay, but Bester learns of this and attempts to stop them. As both Bester and Kelsey places Ironheart under a psychic assault, but Ironheart resists and uses his powers to psychically destroy Kelsey and reduce her to dust. Sinclair knocks Bester out, giving Winters time to escort Ironheart to his ship. Once launched, Ironheart&#x27;s powers fully transform him into an ethereal being. He thanks Sinclair for his help and gives Winters a &quot;gift&quot; before his form departs. Later, Sinclair convinces Bester to lie in his report by stating that Ironheart was killed in his ship, threatening that he would otherwise reveal how Bester endangered the station and how his acts lead to Kelsey&#x27;s death. In her quarters, Winters finds she is now capable of simple telekinesis.

Meanwhile, Catherine Sakai is told of a planet named Sigma 957 which an excavation company would like a survey of, willing to pay her a handsome sum for it. As she prepares, Narn ambassador G&#x27;Kar warns her not to go, as the planet is inhospitable and dangerous, but she goes anyway. When she arrives, a huge, unidentifiable ship passes hers in orbit before disappearing, and her ship loses power, causing her orbit to decay. However, she is rescued in time by two Narn fighters summoned to help her by G&#x27;Kar. Back on Babylon 5 she asks G&#x27;Kar why he helped, and he says he had a good reason, without explaining much further. She also asks about the strange ship, and he compares her encounter to that of an ant being picked up by a human – incomprehensible for the ant, not worthy of attention for the human.

==Production, visual and sound effects ==
===Characters, cast and filming===
Actor Walter Koenig, who played the recurring role of Psi Cop Alfred Bester, is best known for he portrayal of Pavel Chekov in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and films. Koenig was originally offered the role of Knight Two in the episode &#x27;And the Sky full of Stars&#x27;, but was unable to do so because of health issues. Koenig was shifted to the role of Bester in this episode, with the character being specifically written with Koenig in mind. Straczynski had seen Koenig&#x27;s theater work, and felt that Koenig had been typecast as Chekov. Koenig&#x27;s performance as Bester was so well received that Bester – intended to be a one-off appearance – became a recurring character, with Koenig becoming a semi-regular cast member. Bester is named after Alfred Bester, who had been a friend of series conceptual consultant Harlan Ellison, and author of &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;, a futuristic novel featuring a telepathic police force.

In the scene where Bester and Kelsey confront Commander Sinclair and Talia Winters, as they escort Ironheart through the Zocolo, actress Andrea Thompson, playing Winters, arranged to add in part of the scene which wasn&#x27;t in the script. Thompson felt that it was unnatural that she would just stand and watch when Ironheart was being attacked: &quot;I had to fight for that moment... I said, &#x27;Here&#x27;s the love of her life, and they&#x27;re attacking him, and she&#x27;s not going to jump in there? And then they said, &#x27;No, she wouldn&#x27;t because she knows she&#x27;ll be killed.&quot; But I said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize love overcomes all that?&quot;

In the final scene, Talia discovers that Ironheart had left her the gift of telekinesis. Straczynski originally had planned to use these powers later in the series. The way that Thompson played this final scene was inspired by her recently becoming pregnant with her child with her real-life partner, co-star Jerry Doyle. She reflected, &quot;When I first found out that Jerry and I were expecting. It&#x27;s a magical gift, but at the same time, you&#x27;re terribly afraid. It&#x27;s all about the unknown, and you have that sense that your life is changing, that something has happened, you can never turn back.&quot;

The character of Catherine Sakai was played by Julia Nickson. Catherine Sakai previously appeared in &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot;, and would make a final series appearance in &quot;Chrysalis&quot;. Catherine Sakai also features in Kathryn M. Drennan&#x27;s novel, &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot;.

Jason Ironheart was played by William Allen Young, an actor and director who has starred in numerous television, stage, and film projects, including two Academy Award-nominated films, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; and &quot;District 9&quot;. At the end of the episode, when he transforms into an energy-like state, Ironheart says, &quot;I&#x27;ll see you in a million years&quot;, which is a timeframe which has significance at the end of the series.

Bester&#x27;s aide Kelsey was played by English actress Felicity Waterman, who played Vanessa Hunt in the series &quot;Knots Landing&quot;; and played Lt. Abigail Hawling on the series &quot;&quot;. In the scene when Kelsey threatens Ironheart, he tells her, &quot;You cannot harm one who has dreamed a dream like mine.&quot; This line is a prayer for protection from enemies from the Ojibwe culture.

===Visual effects===
The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for the previous episode, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot;

For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using Commodore Amiga computers with LightWave 3D software.

The scenes of the rail car travelling through the interior of the station were created by effects designer Eric Chauvin. The production team built a set of the rail car, which was filmed in front of blue screen, and the core background was rendered and composited by Chauvin.

The Starfury fighter design seen in the episode was designed by Steve Burg as a plausible zero-gravity fighter. The positioning of the four engine pods at the extremities of the craft was inspired by Ron Cobb&#x27;s design for the Gunstar fighter from &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;. The basic shape of the Starfury&#x27;s wings was inspired by an earlier unused design by Burg for a military robot fighting machine, which he had originally designed for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. This was merged with the multi-engined configuration to form the Starfury design. Burg points out that the wings/struts were not aerodynamic: they were there to lever the engines away from the center of mass.

===Music===
Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series’ composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race.

==Reviews==
Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, identifies transcendence as a key theme of the episode. He singles out an exchange between Ironheart and Talia: I am becoming.&#x27; &#x27;Becoming what?&#x27; &#x27;Everything.&#x27; And he does. The episode ends with him becoming an awkward CGI energy being, essentially a god.&quot; Kaiser also notes that how G&#x27;Kar describes the beings at Sigma 957 is going to apply equally to Ironheart.

Elias Rosner, writing in &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, highlights the performance of Walter Koenig as Bester. Rosner writes, &quot;He does a great job of making telepathy and, well, everything look menacing and shady. He&#x27;s transparently evil but not in a way that&#x27;s cliché or over-the-top. You never know if he&#x27;s hiding around a corner, listening in, and he makes sure you know that. He&#x27;s the right amount of cold evil and gives just the best deliveries of the episode. He is Bester.&quot;

Jules-Pierre Malartre, writing in the science fiction review site, &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, notes that the episode is &quot;heavy on sci-fi and social issues&quot; and deals with concepts such as &quot;equality and the potential of human evolution&quot;. Malartre also highlights Walter Koenig&#x27;s performance as Bester: &quot;Babylon 5 would produce a number of villains over the course of its five seasons, but Bester comes out as the best of the lot, thanks in great part to Koenig&#x27;s unique performance, at once charismatic and chilling.&quot;

<doc id="555171" wikidata="Q168832" url="?curid=555171" title="Johann Adam Reincken">
<text>Johann Adam Reincken (also &quot;Jan Adams, Jean Adam&quot;, &quot;Reinken, Reinkinck, Reincke, Reinicke, Reinike&quot;; baptized 10 December 1643 – 24 November 1722) was a Dutch/German organist and composer. He was one of the most important composers of the 17th century, a friend of Dieterich Buxtehude and a major influence on Johann Sebastian Bach; however, very few of his works survive to this day.

==Life==

The widespread claims about Reincken&#x27;s exceptional longevity stem from Johann Mattheson, who, writing in 1722, gave his date of birth as 27 April 1623. However, Reincken himself stated (on the title page of &quot;Hortus musicus&quot;) that his birthplace was Deventer, and no records were found there to support Mattheson&#x27;s claim. A &quot;Jan Reinse&quot; was baptized in Deventer on 10 December 1643; this is the date currently accepted by most scholars, although it is in many ways as problematic as that given by Mattheson.

Reincken received primary music education in Deventer in 1650–1654, from Lucas van Lennick, organist of the Grote kerk (Lebuinuskerk). In 1654 he departed for Hamburg to study under Heinrich Scheidemann, a pupil of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, organist of St. Katharine&#x27;s Church (&quot;Katharinenkirche&quot;). In 1657 he returned to Deventer and became organist of the Bergkerk on 11 March; however, after only a year he left for Hamburg again, this time to become Scheidemann&#x27;s assistant. When the older composer died in 1663, Reincken succeeded him at St. Katharine&#x27;s. In 1665 he married one of Scheidemann&#x27;s daughters, and their only child Margaretha-Maria was born three years later.

The composer kept his position at St. Katharine&#x27;s until his death in 1722, although in 1705 some of the church elders attempted to appoint Johann Mattheson as Reincken&#x27;s successor. Unlike many other contemporary organists, Reincken died wealthy. In his lifetime he was heralded as one of the best organists in Germany; he knew Dieterich Buxtehude closely and influenced Vincent Lübeck and Johann Sebastian Bach. A well-known anecdote tells of Bach&#x27;s visit to Hamburg in 1720, and how Reincken after hearing Bach improvise a lengthy fantasia on the Lutheran chorale &quot;An Wasserflüssen Babylon&quot; (paying homage to Reincken&#x27;s massive fantasia on the same chorale), remarked,&quot;I thought that this art was dead, but I see that it lives in you.&quot; Christoph Wolff adds a further detail, that on the same occasion Bach performed his organ fugue BWV 542, the theme of which is based on a Dutch popular tune (called &#x27;Ik ben gegroet van...&#x27;), presumably as an homage to Reincken&#x27;s Dutch origin. Evidently the young Sebastian Bach had been deeply impressed by Reincken&#x27;s music, for he arranged several of the works from Reincken&#x27;s &quot;Hortus musicus&quot; (as BWV 954, 965 and 966). In 2006, the earliest known Bach autograph was discovered in Weimar. It proved to be a copy of Reincken&#x27;s &quot;An Wasserflüssen Babylon&quot;, which Bach made for his then teacher Georg Böhm in Lüneburg in 1700.

<doc id="555175" wikidata="Q7773481" url="?curid=555175" title="The War Prayer (Babylon 5)">
<text>&quot;The War Prayer&quot; is the seventh episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. It first aired on 9 March 1994. The episode deals with a string of anti-alien attacks on Babylon 5, and the arrival of Malcolm Biggs, who formerly had romantic ties with Lt Commander Ivanova, and who is involved with the anti-alien Home Guard movement.

==Plot==
A string of attacks on aliens has occurred on Babylon 5, the latest being the stabbing and branding of a Minbari poet, Shaal Mayan. Commander Sinclair is pressured by Minbari ambassador Delenn to find the culprit, and he orders Security Chief Garibaldi to investigate in depth. Narn ambassador G&#x27;kar, however, insists more action must be done, and beings to rally the other aliens aboard, creating a tense situation.

Meanwhile, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari must deal with his aide Vir Cotto&#x27;s cousin Kiron and his girlfriend Aria, who have fled the Centauri homeworld as they have been arranged to be wed into different families. Mollari asserts that arranged marriages are a Centauri tradition, love having no place in their society. That evening, Kiron and Aria are attacked, leaving Kiron in a coma.

Elsewhere, Ivanova discovers that her former associate from the academy, Malcolm Biggs, has arrived on the station. While he remains secretive as to his business reasons for being there, Malcolm does express interest in rekindling his relationship with Ivanova.

Aria stays by Kiron&#x27;s side, though Mollari suggests that there is no point in her spending time with Kiron in the hospital. Shaal talks with Mollari about love, stating that she found all sentient beings to be characterized by their capacity to love others and be loved. When Vir laters finds Mollari, the latter tells him a tale from his father who had complained that his shoes were too tight, adding that it did not matter as he had forgotten how to dance. Mollari says he now feels the same way.

When Kiron wakes, Mollari tells him and Aria that he has arranged for them to return to Centauri Prime and stay with his cousin, a powerful figure in the government, to be fostered by him and schooled in Centauri customs. He promises that once they are old enough, they will be allowed to choose whom to marry. He explains this defiance of the usual customs by them being still &quot;children&quot; who should be allowed to &quot;dance&quot;. This solution pleases both them and Vir.

Ivanova brings Malcolm to a reception where Sinclair purposely speaks out against the alien presence, hoping to gain the trust of the hidden attackers. Indeed Malcolm later invites Sinclair and Ivanova to a meeting where he introduces them to his allies that have been behind the attacks, using advanced stealth technology developed by Earthforce. Malcolm explains that they plan to assassinate the four key ambassadors on Babylon 5 in order to provoke an even larger attack against aliens on Earth. They then ask Sinclair to kill an alien woman they have captured in order to prove his loyalty. Instead Sinclair and Ivanova turn on Malcolm and his allies, as security officers arrive to arrest them.

As the arrested conspirators are taken off the station, Malcolm and Ivanova mutually express their disappointment at each other.

==Production==
===Cast===
The Home Guard leader Malcolm Biggs was played by Australian-American actor Tristan Rogers, best known for playing Robert Scorpio in &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Earlier, he played roles in a number of prominent Australian serials such as &quot;Number 96&quot;, &quot;Bellbird.&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;. In 2019 he won a Daytime Emmy Award for his role as Doc in the series &quot;Studio City&quot;.

Minbari poet Shaal Mayan was played by Nancy Lee Grahn, who also appears in &quot;General Hospital&quot;, playing Alexis Davis, winning a Daytime Emmy Award in 2012. Grahn also starred as Julia Wainwright Capwell on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, winning an Emmy Award in 1989.

Vir&#x27;s cousin Kiron Maray was played by Canadian actor Rodney Eastman, best known for playing Joey Crusel in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series. He is also a musician with the Los Angeles band King Straggler with fellow actors John Hawkes and Brentley Gore.

Kiron&#x27;s girlfriend Aria Tensus was played by actress, mathematician and mathematics educator Danica McKellar. McKellar played Winnie Cooper in &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, and Elsie Snuffin in &quot;The West Wing&quot;. She later wrote several mathematics books for children and secondary school students, some of which became &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers.

American actor Michael Paul Chan played Roberts, the man picked by as a suspect in the attack on Shaal Mayan. Chan is known for playing the role of Lieutenant Michael Tao in &quot;The Closer&quot; and &quot;Major Crimes&quot;. He also played roles in &quot;The Goonies&quot;, &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; and &quot;Falling Down&quot;.

===Music, sound and visual effects===
The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for episode 5 of the season, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot;

The design for the Vorlon ambassador, Kosh, who appears in this episode, was created by Steve Burg for the pilot episode. The suit he wears had remote-controlled servo motors to operate the eye lens and the movements of various appendages on the suit, with the lights on the front being operated by the person inside.

For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga computers with Lightwave 3D software.

Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race. The voice effects for the Vorlon ambassador Kosh, were also designed by Franke, with the character voiced by Ardwight Chamberlain.

==Writing==
According to showrunner J. Michael Straczynski, the title refers to a short prose writing of the same title – written to highlight the humanity of participants of both sides in war – by Mark Twain, which, according to Straczynski, &quot;should be read by &quot;.

Regarding Mark Twain, Straczynski wrote, &quot;He&#x27;s always been a seminal influence on my work. I have pretty much everything he&#x27;s ever written, absent the five volume set of his journals that&#x27;s only available to libraries. &#x27;The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg&#x27; is still one of my favorite pieces, as is &#x27;The War Prayer&#x27;, leading to its nod in B5.&quot;

As &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was conceived with an overall five-year story arc, the episode was written as both an individual story and with another level, where the hints of the larger story arc were given. The series&#x27; creator, J. Michael Straczynski indicates that the episodes can be watched for the individual stories, the character stories, or the story arc.

The episode was written by D.C. Fontana who has written episodes for many television series, including a large number of episodes for various &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. Fontana was a writer for the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; pilot episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. She also wrote two other &quot;Babylon 5&quot; scripts, &quot;Legacies&quot; and &quot;A Distant Star&quot;. Fontana wrote the episode, based on a premise by Straczynski. Only the pilot was available for research purposes, so she spent some time speaking with Straczynski to get a feel for the series.

==Commentary and Reviews==

Writers Ensley Guffey and Dale Koontz observe that Londo refers to his wives as Pestilence, Famine and Death, three of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, and that as the fourth member, Londo himself would thus seem to be War, which bodes ill for the events to come.

Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, notes that the episode develops the idea that human culture in the year 2258 isn&#x27;t entirely pleasant. Kaiser writes, &quot;This isn&#x27;t a necessary revelation after &#x27;Infection&#x27; and &#x27;Mind War&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not meant to be a revelation—it&#x27;s a premise.&quot;

Kaiser also identifies the theme of regret appearing throughout the episode. He writes,

Elias Rosner, writing in the &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot; website, also singles out this scene, with Londo discussing with Vir about what it means to be trapped in his own ways, to have forgotten what it is to be young. Rosner observes, &quot;It&#x27;s a profound scene that&#x27;s the right balance of clarity and mystique. Londo&#x27;s words carry all the weight in the world and in that moment, we understand where he is and what he is thinking... It&#x27;s a fantastic bit of dialogue that is revealing in all the right ways.&quot;

<doc id="555177" wikidata="Q501744" url="?curid=555177" title="Alert, Nunavut">
<text>Alert, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada, is the northernmost continuously inhabited place in the world. The location is on Ellesmere Island (in the Queen Elizabeth Islands) at latitude 82°30&#x27;05&quot; north, from the North Pole. It takes its name from the Royal Navy vessel , which wintered east of the present station off what is now Cape Sheridan in 1875–1876.

All Alert residents are temporary, typically serving three- to six-month tours of duty there. They staff a military signals intelligence radio receiving facility at Canadian Forces Station Alert (CFS Alert, which includes Alert Airport), as well as the Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory, a co-located weather station and monitoring observatory, both operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).

In the 2021 census, the permanent population was recorded as 0.

==History==
Alert is named after , a British ship that wintered about away in 1875–76. The ship&#x27;s captain, George Nares, and his crew were the first recorded Europeans to reach the northern end of Ellesmere Island. Over the following decades, several other expeditions passed through the area, most notably Robert Peary during his expedition to reach the North Pole in 1909.

===Post-World War II (1945–1970)===
Shortly after the end of World War II, Charles J. Hubbard of the United States Weather Bureau aroused interest in the United States and Canada for the establishment of a network of Arctic stations. His plan, in broad perspective, envisaged the establishment of two main stations, one in Greenland and the other on the archipelago, which could be reached by sea supply. These main stations would then serve as advance bases from which a number of smaller stations would be established by air. The immediate plans contemplated the establishment of weather stations only, but it was thought that a system of weather stations would also provide a nucleus of transportation, communications, and settlements, which would greatly aid programs of research in many other fields of science. It was recognized that ultimate action would depend on international cooperation, since the land masses involved were under Canadian and Danish control.

Following negotiations between the United States and Canadian governments, a group of five weather stations was established, known as the Joint Arctic Weather Stations (JAWS). On the Canadian side, the stations were to be operated by the Department of Transport (DOT). The locations for each station were surveyed in 1946, and a cache of supplies was dropped at Alert in 1948 by USS &quot;Edisto&quot;. Alert was the last of the five to be settled when the first twelve personnel (eight permanent staff and four to assist with construction) arrived on April 9, 1950. Construction began immediately, with the first priority being the creation of an ice runway on Alert Inlet before work began on the permanent all-season runway on Cape Belknap. Until its completion, supplies were parachuted in.

On July 30, 1950, nine crew members of an Avro Lancaster aircraft, operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), died in a crash while making an airdrop of supplies to the station.

The last United States personnel were withdrawn on October 31, 1970, and the following year operation of the weather station was transferred to the newly created Department of the Environment, with the Department of Transport retaining control of airfield operations for several more years.

In April 1971, a party of federal and Northwest Territories (NWT) government officials arrived in Alert in an attempt to reach the North Pole. Alert had been the embarkation point for many North Pole expeditions that relied on weather information supplied by the weather station there. The 1971 expedition was led by Stu Hodgson, former Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, and included in his party were representatives of the prime minister&#x27;s office, the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, as well as a large media group including Pat Carney of Gemini Productions, Ed Ogle of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Val Wake of &quot;CBC News&quot;, and a television crew from California. While waiting in Alert for a weather window to fly to the pole, the party&#x27;s television crew spent a lot of time filming at the weather station. The military was unhappy about the film crew working on the station, but the weather station was seen as being a sort of no-man&#x27;s land. The commissioner&#x27;s party made two attempts to reach the pole and failed. Some of the incidents surrounding this event are recounted in Val Wake&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Voyage around Spray with Apologies to Captain Joshua Slocum&quot;.

===Recent history (1971–present)===
In August 1975, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his then three-year-old son, future prime minister Justin Trudeau, visited the station and nearby Ward Hunt Island. In August 1986, the Government of Canada opened Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network.

By the 1990s, the original buildings of the original weather station had fallen into disrepair and were burned in the summer of 1996, leaving only the hydrogen shed and a wooden outhouse. The weather station and observatory offices were moved to Polaris Hall.

In early April 2006, the Roly McLenahan Torch that was used to light the flame at Whitehorse, Yukon, for the Canada Winter Games, passed through Alert. While the Canada Games torch was supposed to pass over the North Pole, bad weather prevented a Canadian military Twin Otter from making the trip. The torch did not travel outside Alert that weekend (April 9–12). In August 2006, Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, made a visit to Alert as part of his campaign to promote Canadian sovereignty in the north.

On November 8, 2009, the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay arrived at Alert via airplane from Churchill, Manitoba, reaching its most northerly point on land. The next day it travelled to Iqaluit.

On January 19 and 20, 2015, Governor General David Johnston flew into Alert on a C-17 Globemaster transport from CFB Trenton. He toured Alert, received an overview of its operations, met with civilian and military personnel and presided over a change-of-command.

===Aircraft crashes===
Since Alert has not been regularly accessible by icebreakers due to heavy ice conditions in the Lincoln Sea, resupply is provided by Royal Canadian Air Force transport aircraft which land at the adjacent Alert Airport. Difficult conditions at such a remote northern location have resulted in several incidents, two of which have involved fatalities:

* On July 31, 1950, around 17:00 GMT, an RCAF Lancaster 965 from 405 Squadron Greenwood crashed during the establishment of the JAWS weather station when a parachute for resupplies being airdropped became entangled on the tail of the aircraft. The nine crew members were killed. An attempt was made to recover their bodies; a RCAF Canso was dispatched and the flying boat landed in Dumbell Bay on August 7. The bodies of the Canadian crew were brought aboard in wooden coffins made from packing crates—the family of Colonel C.J. Hubbard of the United States Weather Bureau requested his remains be buried at Alert—but the combination of the extra weight and a tail wind resulted in an aborted takeoff. The Canso struck ground at the narrow point of Dumbell Bay, damaging the tail section and rendering it useless. Following this, it was decided to bury the crew&#x27;s remains west of the airstrip, and a military funeral was held the same day. The arrival of the United States Coast Guard icebreaker allowed repairs to be made to the Canso. The wreckage of the Lancaster is still visible southwest of the CE building.

* On October 11, 1952, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster, flown by the United States Military Air Transport Service, crashed on landing at Alert, while carrying a load of aviation fuel. The four crew members survived the crash; the aircraft was destroyed. The wreckage was pushed to the south side of the runway, where it remains today. Because of the high visibility of the wreckage due to its location at the runway, it is often mistaken for the RCAF Lancaster.

* On October 30, 1991, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules, part of Operation Boxtop, crashed about from the airfield, killing four of the 18 passengers and crew on impact. Pilot John Couch died of exposure following the crash. Couch was conducting a visual approach and descended into a hill due to a mistake regarding the plane&#x27;s true location. A blizzard and the local terrain hampered rescue efforts by personnel from CFS Alert; United States Air Force (USAF) personnel from Thule Air Base south; 435 Transport and Rescue Squadron from CFB Winnipeg, and 440 Transport and Rescue Squadron, from CFB Namao outside Edmonton (both squadrons are part of 17 Wing Winnipeg); 424 Squadron from CFB Trenton, Ontario; and 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron from CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The crash investigation recommended all C-130s be retrofitted with ground proximity detectors. The crash and rescue efforts were the basis of the film &quot;Ordeal in the Arctic&quot; (1993).

==Canadian Forces Station Alert==

Since the beginning of the JAWS project, the Canadian Armed Forces had been interested in the establishment at Alert for several reasons: the JAWS facility extended Canadian sovereignty over a large uninhabited area which Canada claimed as its sovereign territory, and its proximity to the Soviet Union made it of strategic importance. Alert is closer to Moscow (c. ) than it is to Ottawa (c. ). Thus, the possibility of utilizing the site for the purpose of intercepting radio signals was deemed to warrant a military presence.

In 1950, Alert Airport was established. It is the only airport serving the settlement and is presently part of CFS Alert. In 1956, the RCAF, which was expanding its presence throughout the high Arctic with the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line radar network, established a building uphill from the DOT&#x27;s JAWS station to house &quot;High Arctic Long Range Communications Research&quot;, or signals intelligence operations.

In 1957, Alert Wireless Station was conceived as an intercept facility to be jointly staffed by personnel from the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the RCAF. Five additional buildings were constructed: a mess, three barracks/accommodations buildings, and a power house and vehicle maintenance building, in addition to the existing operations building, built in 1956. The operations building housed the radio intercept and cryptographic equipment. On September 1, 1958, control of the station was transferred from the air force to the army, and it officially began operations.

The following decade saw a dramatic expansion of the station, with a correspondingly greater number of personnel stationed there. The February 1, 1968, unification of the RCN, RCAF, and Canadian Army to form the Canadian Armed Forces saw Alert Wireless Station change its name to Canadian Forces Station Alert (CFS Alert). Its personnel were no longer drawn from only the air force or navy, but primarily from the Canadian Forces Communications Command.

At its peak, CFS Alert had upwards of 215 personnel posted at any one time. The station became a key asset in the global ECHELON network of the AUSCANNZUKUS intelligence sharing alliance, also known as &quot;Five Eyes&quot;, with Alert being privy to many secret Soviet communications regarding land-based and sea-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test launches and many operational military deployments.

The first military women to serve in Alert arrived in 1980 as part of the Canadian Forces&#x27; Women In Non-Traditional Roles study. After its completion in 1983, women were fully authorized to serve in all roles. The first female commanding officer was Major Cathy Cowan, who took command in January 1996. The first female Station Warrant Officer (SWO), MWO Renee Hansen, was appointed in December 2017.

Budget cuts to the Department of National Defence (DND) and Canadian Armed Forces in 1994 and modernization of communications equipment saw CFS Alert downsized to approximately 74 personnel by 1997–1998, when most radio-intercept operations were remotely controlled by personnel at CFS Leitrim. Remaining personnel are responsible for airfield operations, construction/engineering, food service, and logistical/administrative support. As of 2024, there are about 55 people stationed at CFS Alert, and they consist of military personnel, ECCC and other civilian employees.

Only six persons are now responsible for actual operations, and control of the facility was passed to DND&#x27;s Information Management Group following the disbanding of CF Communications Command with force restructuring and cutbacks in the mid-1990s.

With Canada&#x27;s commitment to the global war on terrorism following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City and Arlington County, Virginia, CFS Alert has received renewed and increased funding to expand its SIGINT capabilities. On April 1, 2009, the RCAF officially took responsibility for CFS Alert from Canadian Forces Information Operations Group (CFIOG).

=== Civilian contractor ===
On April 13, 2006, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the heating costs for the station had risen, as a consequence of which the military proposed to cut back on support trade positions by using private contractors. By 2008, maintenance operations on the station—including food and housekeeping services, vehicle maintenance, powerplant operation, and heating, electrical, and plumbing—had been transferred to a civilian contractor. The contract was initially awarded to Canadian Base Operators (CBO), a subsidiary of Black &amp; McDonald. In 2012, the contract was won by Nasittuq, a subsidiary of ATCO.

===Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory===

In 1975, technicians employed by the weather station began collecting flask samples for a greenhouse gas monitoring program. In 1980, this grew to include the weekly collection of filter-based aerosol samples for the Canadian Arctic Aerosol Sampling Network (CAASN).

By 1984, the number of ongoing monitoring programs and the amount of experimental research had outgrown the abilities of the weather station to maintain, and plans were made for the construction of a permanent observatory. This observatory, southwest of Lancaster Hall (more commonly known as the far transmitter building), was opened August 29, 1986. Originally known as the Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) Observatory, it was subsequently renamed the Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory in honour of the Environment Canada researcher who provided the impetus for its construction. The observatory employs two technicians who reside at CFS Alert, an operator and an assistant operator (normally a university co-op student). It is managed by Environment and Climate Change Canada.

==Demographics==
While Alert has no permanent residents, it has been continuously inhabited since April 1950. This population, while initially small, grew to upwards of 250 in the 1970s and 1980s, before being downsized in the 1990s when information gathering operations were relayed to CFS Leitrim near Ottawa for collation, reducing the on-site staff considerably. Its current population ranges from a winter minimum of 65 to a summer maximum of 110, plus a variety of short-term visitors, who can swell the total to 150 or more. Alert’s temporary population typically consist of both military personnel and civilians, both making up an almost one-to-one ratio in Alert.

==Geography==
Alert is west of Cape Sheridan, the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island, on the shore of the ice-covered Lincoln Sea. Alert lies just from the North Pole; the nearest Canadian city is Iqaluit, the capital of the territory of Nunavut, distant.

The settlement is surrounded by rugged hills and valleys. The shore is composed primarily of slate and shale. Argillite and greywacke also occur. Some of these rocks are calcareous. The sea is covered with sea ice for most of the year but the ice pack does move out in the summer, leaving open water. Evaporation rates are also very low, as average monthly temperatures are above freezing only in July and August.

Other places on Ellesmere Island are the weather station at Eureka () and the Inuit community of Grise Fiord, , to the southwest and south, respectively. Siorapaluk ( to the south) is the nearest populated place in Greenland. Hans Island which from 2023 has a land border with Greenland, a territory of Denmark, is located to the south.

==Climate==

Alert has a polar climate, technically a tundra climate (ET) with characteristics of an ice cap climate (EF). There is complete snow cover for at least 10 months of the year on average and snow from one year persists into the next year in protected areas, but enough melts to prevent glaciation. The warmest month, July, has an average temperature of , with only July and August averaging above freezing, and those are also the months where well over 90 per cent of the rainfall, which averages only per year, occurs. Rain is rare in June and September and virtually unheard of during the remaining eight months of the year. Alert is the fourth-driest locality in Nunavut and averaging only of precipitation per year, the vast majority of this occurring as snow. The heaviest snowfalls occur during July to October, and Alert sees relatively little snowfall during the winter months. September is usually the month with the heaviest snowfall. The relative humidity is so low that door handles are covered in electrical tape to prevent static electricity. February is the coldest month of the year with a mean temperature of . The yearly mean, , is the second-coldest in Nunavut after Eureka. Snowfall can occur during any month of the year, and the typical year sees no more than five days in a row without frost. Average highs rise above freezing only in mid-June and drop below freezing at the end of August. 

Being far north of the Arctic Circle, Alert experiences polar night from October 14 to February 28, and midnight sun from April 7 to September 4. There are two relatively short periods of twilight from about February 13 to March 22 and the second from September 19 to October 22. Nautical twilight lasts from October 29 to February 11.

Astronomical twilight, where 24 hours are in effect completely dark with only a marginal astronomical twilight—occurs from November 19 to January 22.

<text>The Ingaevones () or Ingvaeones were a Germanic cultural group living in the Northern Germania along the North Sea coast in the areas of Jutland, Holstein, and Lower Saxony in classical antiquity. Tribes in this area included the Angles, Chauci, Saxons, and Jutes.

The name is transmitted in two different forms in ancient sources: Tacitus provides the form , while Pliny the Elder has . Most scholars derive the name from the god or hero attested under the name Yngvi in later Norse sources, and thus believe Pliny&#x27;s form is the original one. Hence the postulated common group of closely related dialects of the &quot;Ingvaeones&quot; is called Ingvaeonic or North Sea Germanic.

Tacitus&#x27; source categorized the &quot;Ingaevones near the ocean&quot; as one of the three tribal groups descended from the three sons of Mannus, son of Tuisto, progenitor of all the Germanic peoples, the other two being the &quot;Irminones&quot; and the &quot;Istaevones&quot;. According to the speculations of Rafael von Uslar, this threefold subdivision of the West Germanic tribes corresponds to archeological evidence from late antiquity. Pliny &quot;ca&quot; AD 80 in his &quot;Natural History&quot; (IV.28) lists the Ingaevones as one of the five Germanic races, the others being the &quot;Vandili&quot;, the &quot;Istvaeones&quot;, the &quot;Hermiones&quot; and the Bastarnae. According to him, the Ingaevones were made up of Cimbri, Teutons and Chauci.

Ing, the legendary father of the Ingaevones/Ingvaeones derives his name from a posited proto-Germanic &quot;*Ingwaz&quot;, as Ing, Ingo or Inguio, son of Mannus. This is also the name applied to the Viking Age deity Freyr, known in Sweden as &quot;Yngvi-Freyr&quot; and mentioned as Yngvi-Freyr in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;. Jacob Grimm, in his &quot;Teutonic Mythology&quot; considers this Ing to have been originally identical to the obscure Scandinavian Yngvi, eponymous ancestor of the Swedish royal house of the &quot;Ynglinga&quot;, the &quot;Inglings&quot; or sons of Ing. Ing appears in the set of verses composed about the 9th century and printed under the title &quot;The Old English Rune Poem&quot; by George Hickes in 1705:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;ang&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ing wæs ærest mid Est-Denum
Gesewen secgum, oþ he siððan est
Ofer wæg gewat; wæn æfter ran;
Þus heardingas þone hæle nemdun.&lt;/poem&gt;

An Ingui is also listed in the Anglo-Saxon royal house of Bernicia and was probably once seen as the progenitor of all Anglian kings. Since the Ingaevones form the bulk of the Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain, they were speculated by Noah Webster to have given England its name, and Grigsby remarks that on the continent &quot;they formed part of the confederacy known as the &#x27;friends of Ing&#x27; and in the new lands they migrated to in the 5th and 6th centuries. In time, they would name these lands Angle-land, and it is tempting to speculate that the word Angle was derived from, or thought of as a pun on, the name of Ing.&quot;

According to the Trojan genealogy in the , &quot;Mannus&quot; becomes &quot;Alanus&quot; and &quot;Ing&quot;, his son, becomes &quot;Neugio&quot;. The three sons of Neugio are named Boguarus, Vandalus and Saxo—from whom came the peoples of the Boguarii (Baiuvarii), the Vandals, the Saxons and Taringi (Thuringii). This account comes to the &quot;Historia&quot; by way of the 6th-century Frankish Table of Nations, which borrows directly from Tacitus.

<doc id="555182" wikidata="Q4753443" url="?curid=555182" title="And the Sky Full of Stars">
<text>&quot;And the Sky Full of Stars&quot; is the eighth episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. It first aired on 16 March 1994.

==Title==
The episode title is derived from a line from &quot;Babylon 5&quot;&#x27;s pilot episode: &quot;…and the sky was full of stars, and every star was an exploding ship — one of ours.&quot;

==Plot==
Two men meet aboard Babylon 5, and prepare a device. They gain the help of Benson, a security officer, who provides them with a power cell in exchange for paying off illegal gambling debts he owes. That night the two men abduct Commander Sinclair and use the device on him. Sinclair finds that he is trapped within a virtual reality illusionary environment, in which one of his captors demands to know what happened to him at the Battle of the Line, the final battle in the Earth-Minbari war ten years earlier. Sinclair was leader of a squadron of fighters which was ambushed by Minbari vessels. While the rest of his squadron was wiped out, Sinclair managed to survive, though having lost a day&#x27;s worth of memories. His captors want to know what he saw, in order to discover why the Minbari suddenly surrendered after Sinclair&#x27;s disappearance.

Meanwhile, security chief Michael Garibaldi discovers that Sinclair is missing, and orders security teams to search the station. When he learns Benson is on one team, and that his gambling debts have been paid off, Garibaldi suspects Benson knows about Sinclair&#x27;s disappearance. Benson returns to Sinclair&#x27;s captors and begs for help, but they kill him and throw his body out through an airlock. The body is later found by the station staff, allowing them to narrow down the likely area where Sinclair is kept.

Meanwhile, Sinclair struggles to fight off his captors&#x27; influence on him, but they eventually break through to his subconsciousness. Sinclair relives his experiences of the Battle of the Line. After his fighter was damaged, Sinclair was taken aboard a Minbari vessel and was taken to the Grey Council, the ruling body of Minbar. Sinclair demanded to know who they were, and pulled the hood off one of them, to reveal Delenn. The Grey Council knocked Sinclair out, scanned him, and returned him to his ship so as to be found by human forces. The trauma of reliving the event for Sinclair enables him to escape his bonds, slamming the device into one captor, shocking him, and stunning the other one. As Sinclair runs, he is still heavily sedated and experiences hallucinations of the Grey Council instead of the regular station staff, and threatens to shoot any that cross his path. Garibaldi sets off to stop him, as does Minbari ambassador Delenn. At the Zocolo, Garibaldi tries to convince Sinclair of his hallucinatory condition, but when Delenn appears, Sinclair recognizes her. He breaks out of his trance in time to kill the pursuing captor.

Dr Franklin helps purge the sedatives from Sinclair&#x27;s body. Learning that Earth&#x27;s government has taken custody of the surviving captor, Sinclair tries to interview him before he is taken away, but discovers he has no memories of what happened. Sinclair goes to see Delenn, who asks if he remembered anything he saw; Sinclair feigns that he had forgotten it and leaves, only to record his memories in his personal log that night. A Minbari official approaches Delenn to see if Sinclair had remembered anything, saying that if he should ever recall his encounter with the Grey Council, he must be killed.
==Production, Visual and Sound Effects ==
===Cast===
The role of Knight Two was played by English actor Christopher Neame. Neame appeared in a number of BBC dramas, including a number of roles in series set during World War 2. He played Lieutenant Dick Player in &quot;Colditz&quot;, Flight Lieutenant Jim Curtis in &quot;Secret Army&quot;, and also played Marc Antony in &quot;The Cleopatras&quot;. Neame later moved to the United States and appears in guest roles in a number of series, including &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. The role of Knight Two was originally offered to Walter Koenig, best known for he portrayal of Pavel Chekov in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and films. Koenig was unable to accept at the time for health reasons, but was later cast as the recurring character of Bester in &quot;Mind War&quot;. The role of Knight Two was then offered to &quot;The Prisoner&quot; star Patrick McGoohan, who likewise wished to accept, but was not going to be in the country at the time of filming, and also had to decline the role.

Actor Judson Scott played the character of Knight One. Scott is known for playing Khan&#x27;s chief henchman in &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, and became friends with Ricardo Montalbán, who played Khan. Scott has appeared in a number of stage productions, and in television science fiction and action series. His roles have including playing the lead character in the short-lived series &quot;The Phoenix (1982 TV series)&quot;, Lieutenant James in the 1984 series &quot;V&quot;, and several characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

===Sound and Visual Effects===
The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode, consisted of the team from makeup design company Optic Nerve. The team – Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for episode 5 of the season, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot; The initial design for the Minbari characters was created by production designer Steve Burg, with the Optic Nerve team finalising the design.

For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with LightWave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

The flashback sequence from the Battle of the Line contained a large number of CGI sequences, with 25 scenes in the space of one and a half minutes. For comparison, the entire 90-minute pilot episode only had around 55 CGI sequences. The Starfury fighters were designed by Burg as a function-driven design for a plausible zero-gravity fighter. The positioning of the four engine pods at the extremities of the craft was inspired by Ron Cobb&#x27;s design for the Gunstar fighter from &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;. The basic shape of the Starfury&#x27;s wings was inspired by an earlier unused design by Burg for a military robot fighting machine, which he had originally designed for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. This was merged with the multi-engined configuration to form the Starfury design.

Despite having a similar wing configuration to the Star Wars X-Wing fighter, this was purely coincidental. Burg recollected, &quot;The X-Wing is a very long needle shaped craft from most angles, whereas the Starfury is a very blunt shape. The X-Wing is also very much configured like a WWII fighter. Ideal for the &#x27;Star Wars&#x27; universe but not what we were going for on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.&quot; Burg also points out that the Starfury&#x27;s wings/struts were not aerodynamic: they were there to lever the engines away from the center of mass.

The Minbari cruisers were designed by the animators at Foundation Imaging, with Ron Thornton contributing to the design. Thornton indicated that the design was influenced by the proud and impressive appearance of the lionfish, but was also designed to be more vertical, like the sunfish.

Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race.

==Reviews==
Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, sees the episode as the first real demonstration of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;&#x27;s heavily serialised overall storyline. Kaiser points out the dichotomy between an episode which, on its own, fails to answer the question of why the Minbari surrendered; and the episode as part of a larger story where there will be a payoff for what we see here. He writes, 

Elias Rosner, writing in the entertainment magazine website &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, in intrigued by the questions that the episode raises. He comments, &quot;What is Delenn up to? Why is a member of the Grey Council acting as an ambassador? And why can he never know what they did to him? The questions are raised and they&#x27;re all good ones. Certainly the strongest part of the episode.&quot;

While Kaiser regards the episode as moving &quot;entertainingly quickly&quot;, Rosner finds the episode not very engaging. He does feel it is redeemed by a frank discussion between Sinclair and Garibaldi about how people lie out of insecurity: &quot;Everyone lies. The innocent lie because they don&#x27;t want to be blamed. The guilty because they have no choice. Find out why he&#x27;s lying.&quot;

<text>&quot;Deathwalker&quot; is the ninth episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. It first aired on 20 April 1994. &#x27; The episode deals with the arrival on Babylon 5 of a Dilgar war criminal nicknamed &quot;Deathwalker&quot;.

==Title==
The title refers to &quot;Deathwalker&quot;, the name by which many races refer to the notorious genocidal war criminal Jha&#x27;dur who arrives on the station in the episode.

==Plot==
An alien woman arriving on Babylon 5 is attacked by Narn diplomatic attaché Na&#x27;Toth as she arrives. Na&#x27;Toth accuses her of being notorious war criminal &quot;Deathwalker&quot;. The woman is knocked unconscious and taken to Medlab, while Commander Sinclair questions Na&#x27;Toth on her attack. Na&#x27;Toth asserts that Deathwalker was a war criminal responsible for a number of unethical and illegal experiments on the Narn people during wartime. In Medlab, Sinclair identifies the woman as a Dilgar, a species that had previously gone to war against many non-aligned worlds, but had died out thirty years ago when their sun went nova. Sinclair continues to investigate the Deathwalker name, finding it attached to a Dilgar known as Jha&#x27;dur, an expert in biochemical, biogenetic, and cyber-organic weapons who led the Dilgar invasion. Sinclair learns rumors that Jha&#x27;dur was at one point sheltered by a sect of the Minbari warrior caste, the Wind Swords. Minbari diplomatic aide Lennier cannot confirm this.

Earth&#x27;s government learns of the Dilgar woman&#x27;s arrival, and orders Commander Sinclair to transport her to Earth immediately. This order troubles Sinclair. In Medlab, the woman wakes up and affirms she is Jha&#x27;dur, otherwise known as Deathwalker, but indicates that she has come for a different purpose: she has started development of a drug which will give its user immortality. Dr Franklin affirms a sample of Jha&#x27;dur&#x27;s work shows promise but will need years of research to complete. Sinclair has Jha&#x27;dur placed under security as travel to Earth is arranged. During this, Jha&#x27;Dur approaches G&#x27;Kar, offering them her immortality drug in exchange for executing Na&#x27;Toth. G&#x27;Kar flatly refuses, and goes to warn the other ambassadors from the non-aligned worlds.

As Sinclair escorts Jha&#x27;Dur to her ship, the non-aligned world representatives stop them and demand that Jha&#x27;dur be brought to trial. Sinclair agrees to hold a council meeting. Sinclair believes that with Minbar voting to bring Jha&#x27;Dur to trial with the non-aligned worlds, they will be able to stop Earth from taking her. However, he is surprised when Lennier votes to not hold Jha&#x27;dur accountable, angering the non-aligned worlds. Lennier apologies to Sinclair, as he had learned that the Wind Swords had harbored Jha&#x27;dur, and if that information were to come out in the open, it would cause great problems on Minbar.

As Jha&#x27;dur&#x27;s transport to Earth is re-established, A Drazi military vessel arrives, followed by several ships from the non-aligned worlds. They threaten to fire upon Babylon 5 if Jha&#x27;dur is allowed to go free. Sinclair offers their representatives a compromise, explaining about the immortality drug and allowing their scientists to participate in its development, after which Earth will turn Jha&#x27;dur over to them. They agree, and their ships are called off. Sinclair sees Jha&#x27;dur one last time before she leaves for Earth, explaining the deal. She tells him that the truth about the immortality drug is that its principal component requires the death of another, and she sees its success as her legacy: namely that the other races will turn on each other like wolves, and become savages as has she. As Sinclair and the other ambassadors watch her ship leave with escorts, they are surprised when a Vorlon ship appears out of the jump gate and destroys Jha&#x27;dur&#x27;s ship. Vorlon ambassador Kosh, who has joined the others, tells them that they are &quot;not ready for immortality&quot;, and walks off.

Separately, Kosh has asked Talia Winters to help with negotiations with a man known as Abbut. Talia finds that she is unable to read anything from Abbut with her telepathic abilities, and as she listens in, he and Kosh speak in seemingly nonsense phrases. As the negotiations go on, Talia finds herself experiencing visions, which culminate in one traumatizing one, re-experiencing the attack of a man she was previously investigating. Frightened out of the vision, she finds that Abbut has concluded his deal: he takes a data crystal out of his cybernetic brain and gives it to Kosh then departs. Talia talks to Garibaldi and Ivanova about the incident, and they tell her Abbut is a known &quot;vicar&quot; (short for VCR, or video cassette recorder: a person with implants allowing them to record thoughts). They suspect that Kosh, who is normally distrustful of telepaths, may have used Abbut to gain information on Talia&#x27;s own weaknesses to use against her in the future.

==Production, visual and sound effects ==
===Casting===
The role of Jha&#x27;dur was played by English actress Sarah Douglas who is known for playing the Kryptonian villain Ursa in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series, and Queen Taramis in &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;. Douglas also played Pamela Lynch is the drama series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;.

The character of Earth Senator Hidoshi, who appears several times in Season 1, was played by actor and singer-songwriter Aki Aleong.

Ambassador Kalika of the Abbai race was played by actress Robyn Curtis, who is known for portraying Lieutenant Saavik in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, as well as performing in a number of stage productions and television series. Robyn Curtis had earlier appeared in the 1993 comedy film &quot;Hexed&quot;, which had starred &quot;Babylon 5&quot; main cast member Claudia Christian.

The role of Abbut was played by Californian actor Cosie Costa.

===Makeup===
The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for episode 5 of the season, &#x27;The Parliament of Dreams&#x27;

===Visual effects===
For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with LightWave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

Visual effects team leader Ron Thornton, who worked on both &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes during his career, wrote that the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; visual effects budgets were around one tenth of the corresponding &quot;Star Trek&quot; budgets, but that &quot;Babylon 5&quot; effects were &quot;much more fun to do.&quot;

The design for the Drazi Sunhawk warship, was created by Thornton. Thornton had created physical models for the BBC series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; in the early 1980s, and based the Sunhawk design on Blake&#x27;s ship, &quot;Liberator&quot;. Thornton had for many years wanted to create an updated and more streamlined version of &quot;Liberator&quot;, indicating, &quot;When they did a reimagining of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; [for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;] – streamlining and generally making it look sexier – it got me thinking about what the Liberator would look like if you did that.&quot;

The saucer-shaped alien ships, which emerge from Babylon 5&#x27;s jump gate and threaten to fire on the station, were also designed by Thornton, containing animated rotating sections, with oversized guns added &quot;for a giggle&quot;. Thornton indicated that his design philosophy he always tried to follow was &quot;good physics with a pinch of artistic license.&quot;
 Straczynski wrote that he thought the saucers were &quot;cool&quot;, but that they needed a little more weight and substance, with some more detail.

The Ishka ship with the globe-shaped power source in the center was also created by Thornton, who wrote that Straczynski had originally wanted the it to be ball-shaped. Thornton was afraid that it would look &quot;a bit like a mini Death Star&quot;, but reduced the sphere in size to become a central power source. Thornton also designed the ship so that he could make it quickly, as some of the ships had to be designed in one day or less.

===Sound===
Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race. The voice of the Vorlon ambassador Kosh was also designed by Franke, with the character voiced by Ardwight Chamberlain.

==Writing and storyline significance==
The episode was written by Larry DiTillio, who wrote four season 1 episodes and three for season 2. DiTillio also contributed to the series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, alongside Straczynski.

As Babylon 5 was conceived with an overall five-year story arc, the episode was written as both an individual story and with another level, where the hints of the larger story arc were given. The series&#x27; creator, J. Michael Straczynski indicates that the episodes can be watched for the individual stories, the character stories, or the story arc.

This episode reveals more about how Babylon 5 fits into the political structures of the series. It reveals how the Earth Alliance&#x27;s defeat of the Dilgar gave Earth a sense of self-importance among the other races. It also shows how the races of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, whilst easily divided, have significant power – which they are quick to use – when united. The episode also develops the concept of the mysterious Minbari Warrior Caste – about which the series has revealed very little previously – and the Wind Swords clan, who seem to know about Commander Sinclair.

==Reviews==
Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, writes there are problems with the premise that the immortality serum requiring the death of another to work, including that the science would essentially be magic.
Notwithstanding, he writes, &quot;View the episode as a parable, however, a structure for a story to generate tension, and it&#x27;s superb. We learn more about each race, and the ambassadors for each race, in symmetrical fashion.&quot; He continues, &quot;&#x27;Deathwalker&#x27; is also more entertaining than most of the episodes surrounding it. It&#x27;s not subtle... but subtlety isn&#x27;t always necessary. Let the characters make speeches, let them debate Platonic ideals like &#x27;Justice or immortality. An intriguing choice.

Elias Rosner, writing in the entertainment magazine website &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, notes how Jha&#x27;dur is portrayed as nothing but purely evil. &quot;Deathwalker is easily the most unambiguously evil character in Babylon 5 so far... none have (so far) been motivated by pure spite and the desire to see the whole universe suffer.&quot; He observes, &quot;&quot;Deathwalker&quot; asks us to ponder is a question that we as humanity have to ask ourselves too often: What do we do with the monster and their creations?&quot;

Rosner also points out how the episode shows how the mere promise of immortality gave a single individual control over not only one major power, but many: &quot;Think about it. By dangling the idea of immortality in front of the Narn, Earth Alliance, and the Babylon 5 Station Command, she controlled all their actions, almost brought war to the station, and forced Command to make terrible choices&quot;.

Jules-Pierre Malartre, writing in the science fiction review site, &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, comments that &#x27;Deathwalker&#x27; made the viewer want to see more of the Dilgar, and the war they waged on the other worlds. Malartre highlights the risk of progress at the expense of our humanity: Deathwalker&#x27; is a very good argument of the cost of scientific advancement on the moral values of a civilisation. It&#x27;s one of the grittiest episodes of season 1 and Sarah Douglas... in the title character offers up the best genre performance of her career.&quot; He observes, &quot;The final intervention of the Vorlon may leave some people feeling cheated of an actual ending, but a lot of viewers won&#x27;t fail to see the irony of that ending... Watching this episode made you feel like you were reading a good, hard sci-fi novel, and not merely some space opera fluff.

<text>The Fon people, also called Dahomeans, Fon nu or Agadja are a Gbe ethnic group. They are the largest ethnic group in Benin, found particularly in its south region; they are also found in southwest Nigeria and Togo. Their total population is estimated to be about 3,500,000 people, and they speak the Fon language, a member of the Gbe languages.

The history of the Fon people is linked to the Dahomey kingdom, a well-organized kingdom by the 17th century but one that shared more ancient roots with the Aja people. The Fon people traditionally were a culture of an oral tradition and had a well-developed polytheistic religious system. They were noted by early 19th-century European traders for their &quot;N&#x27;Nonmiton&quot; practice, or Dahomey Amazons – which empowered their women to serve in the military, who decades later fought the French colonial forces in 1890.

Cities built by the Fon include Abomey, the historical capital city of Dahomey on what was historically referred to by Europeans as the Slave Coast. These cities became major commercial centres for the slave trade. A significant portion of the sugar plantations in the French West Indies, particularly Haiti, Suriname and Trinidad, were populated with slaves that came from the Slave Coast, through the lands of Ewe and Fon people.

== Origin ==
The Fon people, like neighboring ethnic groups in West Africa, remained an oral tradition society through the late medieval era, without ancient historical records. According to these oral histories and legends, the Fon people originated in present-day Tado, a small Aja town now situated near the Togo–Benin border. Their earliest rulers were originally a part of the ruling class in the Aja kingdom of Allada (also called the Ardra kingdom).

The Aja people had a major dispute; one group broke off and these people came to be the Fon people, who migrated to Allada with king Agasu. The sons of king Agasu disputed who should succeed him after his death, and the group split again. This time the Fon people migrated with Agasu&#x27;s son Dogbari northwards to Abomey, where they founded the kingdom of Dahomey sometime about 1620 CE, The Fon people have been settled there since, while the kingdom of Dahomey expanded in southeast Benin by conquering neighboring kingdoms.

The oral history of the Fon further attributes the origins of the Fon people to the intermarrying between this migrating Allada-nu Aja group from the south with the Oyo-nu inhabitants in the (Yoruba) Kingdoms of the plateau. These Yorubas were known as the Igede, which the Ajas called the Gedevi. The fusion of the immigrant Aja conquerors and the original Indigenous Yorubas of the Abomey plateau thus created a new culture, that of the Fon.

Although these oral traditional origins have been passed down through the generations, they are not without controversy. The claim to any origin from within Allada is not recorded in contemporary sources before the late eighteenth century, and is very likely an attempt by the ruling dynasty in the Dahomean kingdom&#x27;s capital of Agbome to legitimize its conquest of the independent coastal kingdom of Allada in the 1720s. These claims can also be interpreted as a metaphorical expressions of cultural and political influences between kingdoms rather than actual kinship.

== History ==

While references and documented history about the Fon people are scant before the 17th century, there are abundant documents on them from the 17th century, particularly written by European travelers and traders to West African coasts. These memoirs mention such cities as Ouidah and Abomey. Among the most circulated texts are those of Archibald Dalzel, a slave trader who in 1793 wrote the legends, history and slave trading practices of the Fon people in a book titled the &quot;History of Dahomey&quot;. Modern era scholars have questioned the objectivity and accuracy of Dalzel, and to what extent his pioneering book on Fon people was a polemic or dispassionate scholarship.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, as the French presence increased and then the colonial period began in the Benin and nearby regions, more history and novels with references to the Fon people appeared, such as those by Édouard Foà, N. Savariau, Le Herisse and M.J. Herskovits&#x27; anthropological study on Fon people published in 1938.

These histories suggest that Fon people&#x27;s kingdom of Dahomey expanded in early 18th century, particularly during King Agaja&#x27;s rule through the 1740s, reaching the Atlantic coast from their inland capital of Abomey. During this period, 200 years after Portugal had already settled in the Kongo people lands on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa in the 16th century, there were numerous plantations in the Caribbean and Atlantic coastline of South America, which had already created a booming demand for slaves from the European traders. The expanded territory of the Dahomey kingdom was well positioned to supply this transatlantic trade and the 18th and 19th century history of the Fon people is generally presented within this context.

=== Slavery, Bight of Benin ===
The Fon people did not invent slavery in Africa, nor did they have a monopoly on slavery nor exclusive slave trading activity. The institution of slavery long predates the origins of the Fon people in the Aja kingdom and the formation of the kingdom of Dahomey. The sub-Saharan and the Red Sea region, states Herbert Klein – a professor of history, was already trading between 5,000 and 10,000 African slaves per year between 800 and 1600 CE, with a majority of these slaves being women and children. According to John Donnelly Fage – a professor of history specializing in Africa, a &quot;slave economy was generally established in the Western and Central Sudan by about the fourteenth century at least, and had certainly spread to the coasts around the Senegal and in Lower Guinea by the fifteenth century&quot;.

By the 15th century, Songhay Empire rulers to the immediate north of the Fon people, in the Niger River valley, were already using thousands of captured slaves for agriculture. The demand for slave labor to produce sugarcane, cotton, palm oil, tobacco and other goods in the plantations of European colonies around the globe had sharply grown between 1650 and 1850. The Bight of Benin was already shipping slaves in the late 17th century, before the Fon people expanded their kingdom to gain control of the coast line. The Fon rulers and merchants, whose powers were established on the Atlantic coast between 1700 and 1740, entered this market. The Fon people were divided on how to respond to the slave demand. Some scholars suggest that Fon people and Dahomey rulers expressed intentions to curtail or end slave trading, states Elizabeth Heath, but historical evidence affirms that the Benin coastline including the ports of the Dahomey rulers and the Fon people became one of the largest exporter of slaves.

The kingdom of Dahomey, along with its neighbors&#x27; kingdoms of Benin and Oyo Empire, raided for slaves and sold their captives into transatlantic slavery. The competition for captives, slaves and government revenues, amongst the African kingdoms, escalated the mutual justification and pressure. The captives were sold as slaves to the Europeans from the Bight of Benin (also called the Slave Coast), from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The Fon people were both victims and also victimized other ethnic groups. Some captives came from wars, but others came from systematic kidnapping within the kingdom or at the frontiers, as well as the caravans of slaves brought in by merchants from the West African interior. The kingdom of Dahomey of Fon people controlled the port Ouidah, from where numerous European slave ships disembarked. However, this was not the only port of the region and it competed with the ports controlled by other nearby kingdoms on the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra.

The Fon people, along with the neighboring ethnic groups such as the Ewe people, disembarked in French colonies to work as slaves in the plantations of the Caribbean and coasts of South America. They were initially called &quot;Whydah&quot;, which probably meant &quot;people sold by Alladah&quot;. The word &quot;Whydah&quot; phonetically evolved into &quot;Rada&quot;, the name of the West African community that embarked in slave ships from the Bight of Benin, and is now found in Haiti, Saint Lucia, Trinidad, French Antilles and other nearby islands with French influence. In some Caribbean colonial documents, alternate spellings such as &quot;Rara&quot; are also found.

The slave traders and ship owners of European colonial system encouraged competition, equipped the various kingdoms with weapons, which they paid for with slaves, as well as built infrastructure such as ports and forts to strengthen the small kingdoms. However, slave trading in the Bight of Benin soon came to an end as European and American nations passed legislation which outlawed their involvement in the slave trade. The last nation in the Americas to officially outlaw the slave trade was Imperial Brazil, in 1851. When slave exports ceased, the king of the Fon people shifted to agricultural exports to France, particularly palm oil, but used slaves to operate the plantations. The agricultural exports were not as lucrative as slave exports had been in past. To recover state revenues he leased the ports in his kingdom to the French through a signed agreement in late 19th century. The French interpreted the agreement as ceding the land and ports, while the Dahomey kingdom disagreed. The dispute led to a French attack in 1890, and annexation of the kingdom as a French colony in 1892. This started the colonial rule for the Fon people.

===French colonial era===
The period of French colonial empire marked the end of the Fon royalty, though France kept the system of plantations, which they had inherited from the royalty. The only difference, so states Patrick Manning – a professor of World History specializing on Africa, for the next seventy years was that the French colonial state, instead of the former king of Fon people, now decided how the surplus (profits) from these plantations were to be spent. The French colonial administrators made some infrastructure improvements to improve the plantation profitability and logistics to serve French colonial interests.

The French colonial administration targeted slavery in Benin, they outlawed capture of slaves, legally freed numerous slaves, but faced resistance and factional struggles from previous local slave owners running their farms. The slavery that continued included those that was lineage-related, who cohabited within families in the region. The Fon aristocracy adapted to the new conditions, by joining the ranks of administrators in the French rule.

Taxes new to the Dahomey colony&#x27;s people, which the French called &quot;impôt&quot;, similar to those already practiced in France, were introduced on all ethnic groups, including the Fon people, by the colonial administrators. Payment of these were regularly resisted or just refused, leading to confrontations, revolts, arrests, prison terms and forced labor. These complaints gelled into an anti-colonial nationalism movement in which the Fon people participated. France agreed to autonomy to Dahomey in 1958, and full independence in 1960.

== Religion ==
Some Fon people converted to Christianity or Islam under the influence of missionaries during the colonial era, in Benin and in French West Indies colonies, but many continued their traditional religious practices. While Islam arrived in the Benin area between 11th and 13th centuries, Christianity was adopted by Dahomey ruler Agonglo who came to power in 1789, and his Fon royalty supporters, with missionaries welcomed. According to Steven Mailloux, the missionaries attempted to integrate the old concepts of Fon people on cosmogenesis to be same as Adam-Eve, and their &quot;Legba&quot; to be Christian &quot;Satan&quot;, teachings that led to syncretism rather than abandonment.

The Fon people, states Mary Turner, have generally proven to be highly resistant to Christianity and Islam, even when brought over as slaves in a new environment as evident in Haiti They have generally refused to accept innovative re-interpretation of Fon mythologies within the Abrahamic mythical framework. The priests of the Fon people, contrary to the expectations of the missionaries, adopted and re-interpreted Abrahamic myths into their own frameworks.

===Traditional beliefs===
The traditional Fon religion is regionally called &quot;Vodoun&quot;, &quot;Vodzu&quot; or &quot;Vodu&quot;, which is etymologically linked to &quot;Vodun&quot; – a term that refers to their theological concept of &quot;numerous immortal spirits and deities&quot;.

The religious practice of the Fon people have four overlapping elements: public gods, personal or private gods, ancestral spirits, and magic or charms. Thus, the Vodoun religion is polytheistic. The Fon people have a concept of a female Supreme Being called Nana Buluku, who gave birth to the Mawu-Lisa and created the universe. After giving birth, the mother Supreme retired, and left everything to Mawu-Lisa (Moon-Sun, female-male) deities, spirits and inert universe. Mawu-Lisa created numerous minor imperfect deities. In Fon belief, the feminine deity Mawu had to work with trickster Legba and the cosmic serpent Aido Hwedo to create living beings, a method of creation that imbued the good, the bad and a destiny for every creature including human beings. Only by appeasing lesser deities and Legba, in Fon theology, can one change that destiny. This appeasing requires rituals and offerings to the lesser gods and ancestral spirits, who are believed to have ability to do favors to human beings. A typical traditional home compound of the Fon people has a &quot;Dexoxos&quot;, or ancestral shrine. The charms are locally called &quot;gbo, gris gris, ju ju&quot;, or &quot;obeah&quot;, involve leaves, herbs, smoke and these are offerings to public or personal gods of each family.
While many Fon identify as Christian, the majority continue to practice Benin&#x27;s traditional religion Vodun. The Fon have priests and mediums who receive the spirits on the occasion of the great festivals. The cult of the sacred serpents in the temple of Whydah had some importance, but eventually fell into disuse. Practice can involve drumming to induce possession by one of these gods or spirits. Together with other cultural groups from the Fon homeland region such as the Yoruba and Bantu, Fon culture merged with French, Portuguese or Spanish to produce distinct religions (Voodoo, Obeah, Candomblé and Santería), dance and musical styles (Arará, Yan Valu).

In the French colonies, such as Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), the Christian missionaries confiscated and burnt the statues and religious objects of the Fon people, but this did not end their practices. They rebuilt their icons again. The Fon people and their government have reversed the colonial attempts to culturally change them. After the end of the colonial era, January 10 has been declared an official annual holiday in Benin dedicated to Vodun gods.

== Society and culture ==

The Fon people are traditionally settled farmers, growing cassava, corn and yams as staples. The men prepare the fields, women tend and harvest the crop. Hunting and fishing are other sources of food, while some members of the Fon society make pottery, weave clothes and produce metal utensils. Among the cash crops, palm oil plantations are common in Fon people&#x27;s region. The Fon culture is patrilineal and allows polygyny and divorce. A man with multiple wives usually lived in a compound with each wife and her children occupying a separate hut. A collection of compounds formed a village, usually headed by a hereditary chief. In contemporary times, traditional patrilineal clan-based living and associated practices are uncommon.

Funerals and death anniversaries to remember their loved ones are important events, including drumming and dancing as a form of mourning and celebrating their start of life as a spirit by the one who died, can last for days.

The Fon culture incorporated culture and shared ideas with ethnic groups that have been their historical neighbors. Many of their practices are found among Yoruba people, Akan people, Ewe people and others.

===Dahomey Amazons===

A notable part of the Fon people&#x27;s society was their use of female soldiers in combat roles over some two centuries. Over 3,000 women trained and served as regular warriors to protect the Fon and to expand its reach. The women warrior&#x27;s brigade was led by a woman.

Given the oral tradition of Fon people, when women joined as warriors in Fon society is unclear. The earliest European records, such as those of Jean-Pierre Thibault, suggest that the tradition dates back to the early 18th century or even earlier. These gender roles were foreign to the European travellers, and early fictional stories in European media are considered unreliable by many scholars.

<doc id="555195" wikidata="Q7647329" url="?curid=555195" title="Survivors (Babylon 5)">
<text>&quot;Survivors&quot; is the eleventh episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. It first aired on May 4, 1994.

==Plot==
Earth President Luis Santiago is scheduled to visit the Babylon 5 space station. Ahead of his visit, the station is set to receive a new wing of fighters to be permanently based there, which will be used for escort upon the President&#x27;s arrival. While going to inspect the fighter launch bays, security chief Garibaldi and Lieutenant Commander Ivanova narrowly avoid an explosion in a nearby bay. A worker in a space suit is blown into space. In Medlab, Dr. Franklin tends an injured man, Nolan, telling Sinclair and Garibaldi that any attempt to rouse the patient would kill him. Initial investigation suggests the explosion was set purposely, and due to the impending visit, Earthforce sends Major Lianna Kemmer to lead the investigation.

Garibaldi and Kemmer have a history, as seventeen years prior, Garibaldi&#x27;s behavior had led to the death of Kemmer&#x27;s father, Frank – who was an old friend of Garibaldi&#x27;s – by enemies Garibaldi created, though Garibaldi was not directly responsible. Kemmer, who is resentful of Garibaldi&#x27;s presence, wakes Nolan to question him against Dr. Franklin&#x27;s advice. In response to being asked who caused the bombing, Nolan wakes up just long enough to mutter Garibaldi&#x27;s name before he dies. Sinclair, though sure that Garibaldi is not guilty, is forced to have Garibaldi turn over his security pass and weapon while the investigation takes place.

Cutter, Kemmer&#x27;s second in command, searches Garibaldi&#x27;s quarters and finds plans to the fighter bay and Centauri ducats, suggesting Garibaldi was paid to execute the bombing. Garibaldi flees before he can be caught. Sinclair and Ivanova remain convinced that Garibaldi has been set up, and do their best to slow down Kemmer&#x27;s investigation, such as blocking all communications to Earth under the guise of maintenance. Garibaldi discretely speaks with Ambassadors Mollari and G&#x27;Kar to try to track the source of the ducats, learning they were likely purchased on the station with standard credits. Garibaldi tries to question seedy aliens who he knows have performed such deals, but ends up in a fight; Sinclair, having heard of a security incident, arrives to help rescue Garibaldi, but insists Garibaldi should turn himself in and let them clear up the matter. Garibaldi refuses and runs off. He takes shelter in a questionable bar, and ends up getting heavily drunk. Upon leaving the bar, he is easily captured by Kemmer.

With the new fighters having arrived and the President&#x27;s ship making the jump, preparations are made to launch the fighters. As Kemmer interrogates Garibaldi, they learn that Sinclair ordered a search of Nolan&#x27;s quarters and found more ducats, as well as information pertaining to the Home Guard, a group of humans on Earth that want to purify Earth from aliens. Garibaldi comes up with a hypothesis: that the Home Guard was planning to attack during the visit of President Santiago to derail the President&#x27;s alien-friendly course and that Nolan was trying to plant the bomb when it was set off prematurely by the plasma drivers in the launch bay. He also suggests that Cutter likewise belongs to the Home Guard and planted the evidence against him. Though Kemmer is skeptical, she agrees to go with Garibaldi to the bays to inspect them once more, having already sent Cutter to do so. When they arrive there, Cutter knocks out Kemmer before Garibaldi attacks him. Garibaldi defeats Cutter and contacts Ivanova to hold the fighter launch, now convinced that there are bombs set to explode upon launch.

The bombs are successfully defused, and Garibaldi is reinstated. The President&#x27;s trip is successful. As Kemmer leaves for her shuttle, she thanks Garibaldi for the &quot;creative&quot; report he had written on the situation. Garibaldi says he owes her for Frank. She apologizes, saying she had no excuse for what she put him through: as Sinclair had suspected, she was not out for justice, but for blood. Garibaldi replies that they had both died inside upon her father&#x27;s death and that she had lashed out because it had hurt her so much. He adds that all they can do is survive and maybe, one day, forget how much it hurts to be human. Before walking away, Kemmer turns back to give him an embrace.

==Title==
According to series creator J. Michael Straczynski, the episode title was originally &quot;A Knife in the Shadows&quot;. The title &quot;Survivors&quot; comes from a dialogue at the end of the episode between Garibaldi and Major Lianna Kemmer as she leaves Babylon 5. Garibaldi refers to the death of Lianna&#x27;s father Frank, saying, &quot;Seventeen years ago we both died inside. But somehow we survived. For better or worse, that&#x27;s all we can do. Survive and, maybe one day, forget how much it can hurt to be human.&quot; Straczynski regards &quot;Survivors&quot; as being a more apt title.

==Production, visual and sound effects==
The role of Lianna Kemmer was played by actor and producer Eliane Thomas, with Robin Wake portraying Lianna as a child. Kemmer&#x27;s assistant, Cutter, was played by Tom Donaldson. General Netter, played by Rod Perry, was named after executive producer Douglas Netter. While President Luis Santiago is not seen in this episode, his voice is heard giving a speech. He was previously portrayed by a photograph of Douglas Netter. The recurring character of security officer Lou Welch was played by David Crowley, and the ISN news anchor, who appears in multiple episodes across the series and its spin-off, Crusade, was played by Maggie Egan.

The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for episode 5 of the season, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot;.

For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with LightWave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

The production team began the use of computer generated virtual sets for certain scenes. This episode has an early example: at the end of the episode when Kemmer boards a shuttle, the walls, the ship and the door she enters were all CGI, with the boarding stairs being the only physical prop.

The presidential ship, Earthforce One, was designed by Ron Thornton, its color scheme being that of the US presidential aircraft Air Force One. As Air Force One is a modified luxury passenger aircraft, Thornton thought to adapt the design of the &quot;Asimov&quot; passenger liner shown in the series. Earthforce One was also inspired by a ship with a saucer-shaped section, travelling flat end first, in a comic series called &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire&quot;, which Thornton had admired when he was young. The four elongated hexagonal panels extending from the ship are not solar panels, but rather depict heat exchangers, as are the similar panels on the rear of the Babylon 5 station. As Thornton used the shape frequently, visual effects artist John Teska dubbed the shape a &quot;Thorntagon&quot;, although Thornton mentioned that Steve Burg also used it a lot, so it should be called a &quot;Burg/Thorntagon&quot;.

The Starfury fighters, were designed by Steve Burg as a function-driven design for a plausible zero-gravity fighter. The positioning of the four engine pods at the extremities of the craft was inspired by Ron Cobb’s design for the Gunstar fighter from &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;. The Starfury&#x27;s &quot;wings&quot; are not aerodynamic: their function is to lever the engines away from the center of mass. Their basic shape was taken from an earlier unused design by Burg for a military fighting robot, which he had designed for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;.

The shuttle craft were also designed by Ron Thornton, based on a ship which he had originally built as a physical model for the BBC, which was used as the shuttle in the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;Orbit&quot;.

Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race.

==Writing and storyline significance==
The episode was written by science fiction novelist and screenwriter Marc Scott Zicree, who has written for many science fiction series, including the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, &quot;Space Command&quot; (2020) and &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;. As Babylon 5 was conceived with an overall five-year story arc, the episode was written as both an individual story and with another level, where the hints of the larger story arc were given. The series&#x27; creator, J. Michael Straczynski, indicates that the episodes can be watched for the individual stories, the character stories, or the story arc.

The series story arc develops in various ways in this episode. Garibaldi&#x27;s troubled past, first hinted at in &quot;Infection&quot;, where he refuses to answer a news reporter&#x27;s questions, comes back to haunt him. Being the only honest cop amidst widespread corruption on Europa led to the death of his only friend there, Frank Kemmer, as Garibaldi became blacklisted and fell into alcoholism.

The Earth anti-alien group, the Home Guard, first appearing in &quot;The War Prayer&quot;, returns, where Malcolm&#x27;s promise – that they have friends everywhere – is outworked here. Both Nolan, the maintenance worker, and Cutter, second in command of presidential security, are members. Elias Rosner writes, &quot;If that doesn&#x27;t send a terrifying message, I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you.&quot; This seeds another plot thread: the antagonism between Home Guard and not just the Babylon 5 officers, but also President Santiago. Rosner comments on the insidiousness of their organization, and how it shows how patient this kind of hate is, and what happens right under our noses.

==Reviews==
Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, sees the primary purpose of the episode as explaining Garibaldi&#x27;s backstory. Garibaldi&#x27;s past is characterized by both integrity and alcoholism, although in the opinions of many people from his past, the alcoholism overwhelms the integrity. Kaiser sees this as theoretically a good way to add depth, as Garibaldi&#x27;s character is too easily defined by his job, but in practice, Kaiser sees the episode as a &quot;generic bad action movie&quot;. He writes, &quot;There&#x27;s a core of something that works here, but &#x27;Survivors&#x27; doesn&#x27;t pull it off.&quot;

Elias Rosner, writing in the entertainment magazine website &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, notes that this episode begins to bring together small elements from earlier in the season to make them important for the larger storylines and character arcs. On Garibaldi, Rosner comments that Garibaldi only gives up drinking again because of the shame of succumbing when things were tough, and the shame of being exactly what Kemmer believed him to be, and he admits it – he has to live with those decisions, but whether he is fully changed is left ambiguous.

In addition to providing insight into Garibaldi&#x27;s character and his past, and the looming situation with the Home Guard, Rosner appreciates seeing the interactions of the ambassadors, Londo and G&#x27;Kar, with a fleeing Garibaldi – who no longer has his usual position and power – providing insight into the way their minds work.

<text>Wallace Foster Davenport (30 June 1925 – 18 March 2004) was an American jazz trumpeter. Davenport has been one of the few traditional jazz musicians of the 1930s who later branched out into swing and bop styles, as well as backing gospel and R&amp;B vocalists during an extensive career in eight different decades.

Davenport was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He started on trumpet at age 13 with The Young Tuxedo Brass Band. He played with Papa Celestin in 1941 before leaving New Orleans to serve in the U. S. Navy. Davenport returned there after World War II, making an easy transition to swing and bop with various bands. He recorded with Roy Brown in 1947. During the 1950s he toured the US and Europe playing with Lionel Hampton, and recorded in Paris in the mid-&#x27;50 with Mezz Mezzrow.

Davenport played and recorded with the Count Basie jazz orchestra (1964–1966), and also toured with singers Ray Charles and Lloyd Price. In 1969 he went back to doing traditional jazz in New Orleans, and issued recordings of his groups playing this style from on his own label &quot;My Jazz&quot; (1971–1976); recorded again in Europe with George Wein in 1974, with Panama Francis and Arnett Cobb in 1976, and also reunited with Hampton and recorded with Earl Hines this same year. In the eighties, Davenport worked with both traditional units as The Alliance Hall Dixieland Band and gospel groups like The Zion Harmonizers and Aline White, and backed the vocalists Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. However, he routinely went on impromptu tours in Asia and Europe, and once played expressly for the king Olav V of Norway.

A cultural icon of New Orleans, Davenport played regularly at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and the French Quarter Festival. He received numerous awards and recognitions for his musical contributions from the city government and local arts groups, including a plaque from the City of New Orleans and lifetime achievement awards from the Preservation Resource Center&#x27;s African-American Historic Preservation Council, the New Orleans Streets Arts Council and the Ashe Cultural Center.

Wallace Davenport died in New Orleans, Louisiana, at 78 years of age. His nephew was Roger Donald Dickerson.

<text>Reed Eric Hundt (born March 3, 1948) is the chairman, CEO and co-founder of the Coalition for Green Capital. 

== Biography ==
Hundt attended high school in Washington D.C. at St. Albans School, graduating in 1965. He went to Yale College, where he majored in history, and worked on the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. Hundt taught school for several years before graduating from Yale Law School in 1974. He clerked for Harrison Lee Winter, a Baltimore judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, before moving to Los Angeles, where he became the 85th lawyer at Latham &amp; Watkins, one of the top law firms in the world.

In 1980, Hundt moved to the Latham &amp; Watkins&#x27; Washington, D.C., office. In his litigation career at the firm, Hundt appeared in court in 48 states and the District of Columbia, argued appellate cases in almost all circuits, and handled cases in many topic areas, although he specialized in antitrust.

From 1983 Hundt supported Al Gore&#x27;s political career. In 1992-3 he was part of the Clinton-Gore transition team, and chaired the committee that drafted the partly successful carbon tax introduced and passed in the House of Representatives in 1993. It was not passed through the Senate. In 1993 President Clinton, whom Hundt had known in law school, nominated Hundt to be chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. He was confirmed in November 1993.

Between 1998 and 2008, Hundt was a senior advisor to McKinsey, the consulting firm. He also served on many technology company boards from 1998 to the present, co-founded four firms (none of which was wildly successful), gave many speeches, wrote five books and numerous articles.

<doc id="555201" wikidata="Q300430" url="?curid=555201" title="A Guy Called Gerald">
<text>Gerald Rydel Simpson (born 16 February 1967), better known as A Guy Called Gerald, is a British record producer and musician. He was an early member of the electronic group 808 State, contributing to their debut LP &quot;Newbuild&quot; (1988) and hit single &quot;Pacific State&quot; (1989). He also achieved solo success with his 1988 hit single &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot;, which became a touchstone of Manchester&#x27;s acid house scene and reached No. 12 in the UK charts. He embraced breakbeat production in the 1990s, with his 1995 album &quot;Black Secret Technology&quot; becoming a &quot;much-touted candidate for &#x27;best jungle album ever.&#x27;&quot; He also ran the London-based independent record label Juice Box Records from 1991 to 1998.

==Early life and influences==
Simpson was influenced by his Jamaican roots; his father&#x27;s blue beat, ska and Trojan reggae record collection, his mother&#x27;s Pentecostal church sessions and the Jamaican sound system parties in Manchester&#x27;s Moss Side area where he grew up.

He absorbed jazz fusion and electro funk at clubs, youth clubs and shebeens such as Legends, St.Alfonso&#x27;s, British Legion and the Reno in Manchester, where the dancefloor in the early 1980s inspired him to study contemporary dance. Manchester was a hotbed of dance music with black club nights open every night of the week and Simpson spent his time joining in the vibe. Simpson was principally influenced by dancers such as Foot Patrol and the Jazz Defektors, regulars in the North of England black club scene. 

Around 1983 with electro booming and early hip hop, breakdancing and b-boy culture from Detroit and Chicago – from producers such as Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson was being played by Stu Allan on Piccadilly Radio and imported directly into Manchester&#x27;s specialist record shops.

==Career==
===808 State and &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot;===
Inspired, Simpson began experimenting with tape editing and drum machines and the regular jams in the attic of his house led to forming the Scratchbeat Masters. Using cut up beats, samples and turntables they would challenge other bands and their sound systems. They released a 12&quot; single called &quot;Wax on the Melt&quot;, a collaboration between a number of crews and Graham Massey and Martin Price together with whom he would later form 808 State. Their first album, &quot;Newbuild&quot;, was released in 1988, but he soon left the group to concentrate on his solo work.

The result of heading back into his bedroom studio was &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot;, played first at the Hacienda in 1988, and then the underground clubs before entering the UK Singles Chart a year later. It was the first acid house track produced in the UK, and released on a small Merseyside independent label (Rham! Records) based in Wallasey. &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; entered the UK chart in 1989 rising to number 12.

At the same time a track Simpson started before leaving 808 State, &quot;Pacific State&quot;, was released and hit the charts. However, according to Simpson, they had finished and released the track without his permission. Although Simpson was credited on its first release on the album &quot;Quadrastate&quot; both as a writer and co-producer, the dispute escalated as Simpson claimed to have written the entire track.

Gerald subsequently signed with Sony Music and released the albums &quot;Hot Lemonade&quot; (1989) and &quot;Automanikk&quot; (1990) to moderate commercial success. He was subsequently allowed to leave his Sony contract after the label refused to release his intended follow-up album &quot;High Life, Low Profile&quot;. The album was reportedly rejected for being too song-oriented.

===Juice Box Records and jungle===
In 1991, he started his own label, Juice Box Records, releasing a string of 12&quot; singles – the seeds of what became known as jungle and later drum and bass. The first singles were compiled and released on his third album &quot;28 Gun Bad Boy&quot; (1992). In 1995, his next album, &quot;Black Secret Technology&quot; was released. A remastered version was re-issued in June 2008.

Juice Box Records was an independent record label in the United Kingdom, based at Riverside Studios in West London. It was established by Simpson in 1991, after he left SME Records, and closed in 1998. It took its name from the sound system that Simpson operated with MC Tunes. The label provided an outlet for seven years for Simpson&#x27;s work, with thirty three titles released under various other pseudonyms such as The K.G.B. and Ricky Rouge, and collaborations between Simpson and artists including Lisa May, DJ Tamsin, Goldie (as &#x27;The 2 G&#x27;s&#x27;), and Finley Quaye.

The label has been identified as being responsible for influential releases that provided the blueprint for what was to become jungle then drum and bass, with early singles on the label described as &quot;genre-defining&quot;. The early singles on the label were compiled on the LP &quot;28 Gun Bad Boy&quot;, of which Simon Reynolds of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated in a review of the album, &quot;If there was a blueprint for what would transform rave into jungle/techno, then this is it.&quot;. It is regarded as the first full-length jungle album ever released.

Reynolds also stated in a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; article in October 1994, about Simpson&#x27;s Juice Box-era music, &quot;Gerald&#x27;s tracks take the jungle mesh of polyrhythms, cross-rhythms and counter-rhythms to new levels of insane detail.&quot; Gerald&#x27;s &quot;Black Secret Technology&quot; LP was released in 1995 and reached the UK Albums Chart at number 64, including contributions from Goldie and Finley Quaye, In 1998, the label closed, with Simpson relocating to New York.

===1997–2013===
In 1997, he moved to New York and, in 2000, released &quot;Essence&quot; on the independent label !K7 Records. &quot;Essence&quot; was Simpson&#x27;s first song-based rather than dance/club album, featuring guests such as Lou Rhodes, David Simpson, Lady Miss Kier and Wendy Page. In January 2005, he released a more ambient album &quot;To All Things What They Need&quot;, also on !K7 Records.

In August 2006, &quot;Proto Acid / The Berlin Sessions&quot; was released on the German label, Laboratory Instinct. A continuous mix album, it was recorded live in Berlin. The second album in The Berlin Sessions series was released in 2010: &quot;Tronic Jazz / The Berlin Sessions&quot;.

&quot;How Long Is Now&quot; EP was released on Bosconi Records in 2012.

In 2013, the album &quot;Silent Spread Sound Spectrum&quot; was released on the Society of Sound – a subscription based music retail project by Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio equipment company. Subscribers receive two albums per month curated by Peter Gabriel and the London Symphony Orchestra.

&quot;The entire track was performed by Gerald live (in the Big Room at Real World Studios) from two laptops captured into a Pro Tools HD system. Audio resolution was high throughout this project with a 24 bit resolution and a 96kHz sampling rate maintained from creation through to capturing the performance. A few additional sounds made it onto this album that were taken from 1986 – sampled from a vinyl release and incorporated into this composition.&quot;

&quot;I am fascinated by the science of sound. Silent Sound Spread Spectrum (SSSS) or S-Quad or Squad is allegedly a technology used by the US Department of Defence that uses subliminal programming carried over ultra-high frequency broadcast waves. With this system, planting inaudible messages directly into the subconscious becomes very easy to do and everyone is susceptible. This composition is about 50 mins and it follows no specific style. It should leave the listener refreshed and relaxed.&quot; – A Guy Called Gerald

===2013–present===
Simpson has been touring steadily worldwide preferring to perform his own productions Live in Session.

On 2015, Simpson is concentrating on a new album and developing a &quot;Live in Session&quot; experience – &quot;a new way to present the music live based around the idea of being in the centre of the dancefloor and at eye level... I am looking to create a space which mimics the studio environment – not only that – because I would be in the centre of the dancefloor so I can monitor everything around me and be at the same level – eye-level with the presumed dancer. This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind of like an open kitchen in a restaurant – it&#x27;s an open kitchen in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it&#x27;s produced it&#x27;s already on the dancefloor. What I&#x27;m looking for in 2015 is sound reproduction in the clubs being taken a lot more seriously than in the past.&quot;

<doc id="555203" wikidata="Q5003768" url="?curid=555203" title="By Any Means Necessary (Babylon 5)">
<text>&quot;By Any Means Necessary&quot; is the 12th episode of the first season of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. The storyline involves a major industrial dispute involving the workers aboard the Babylon 5 station, its political ramifications back on Earth, and how Commander Jeffery Sinclair resolves the crisis. It first aired on May 11, 1994. 

==Title==
The episode was originally planned to have the title &#x27;Backlash&#x27;, which was changed pre-production. The title refers to the (fictional) Rush Act, which – when enacted – permits a military commander to resolve an industrial strike by any means necessary, including the use of military force.

==Plot==
A computer glitch results in a Narn vessel, docking to deliver cargo, crashing into another ship mistakenly cleared to leave Babylon 5. One of the dock workers is killed. The docker workers&#x27; union, led by Neeoma Connally, insists this is a result of equipment failure and overworked crews. The former is confirmed by security; substandard microchips from a subcontractor triggered the mistaken clearance of the departing vessel. Connally demands funding for new equipment and more staff. Commander Sinclair agrees to request the funding. 

Earth Central&#x27;s budget for Babylon 5 provides neither funding for new equipment nor for additional staff. It does add funding for weaponry. In response, the dock workers engage in a version of the &quot;blue flu&quot; (a reference by Garibaldi to police union members pretending to be sick to get around anti-strike regulations). Earth Senator Hidoshi orders Sinclair to end the de facto strike. The attempt to end the strike backfires. Led by an angry Delvientos, the workers openly declare a strike. 

The accident also results in the destruction of cargo that included a &quot;G&#x27;Quan Eth&quot;, a hard-to-obtain flower which the Narn ambassador G&#x27;Kar needs for a religious ritual in a few days. It turns out that Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari has the only one left on the station. Mollari agrees to sell the plant for 50,000 credits, ridiculously more than market value. When G&#x27;Kar later offers the funds, Mollari reneges, saying he will never provide the plant, in retribution for the Narn attack on Ragesh III, during which his nephew was abused. In retaliation, G&#x27;Kar arranges for an important Centauri idol to be stolen to force the surrender of the plant, while Sinclair is forced to endure this petty conflict as a neutral agent.

Orin Zento, the (ostensible) negotiator sent by the Earth Senate Labor Committee to settle the strike, offers nothing but empty promises and threats of retribution for the striking workers. The strike gives the Earth Senate the excuse that it was looking for to invoke the &quot;Rush Act&quot;, which permits a commander to use any means necessary, including the use of force, to end a strike. The strikers end up rioting when a security force goes to arrest them, with Commander Sinclair managing to end the situation before anyone gets seriously injured. Zento then has the Senate invokes the act. 

Instead of using security personnel to end the strike as the Senate intended, Sinclair finds a loophole in the orders that allows him to divert excess funding from the military budget to hire additional workers and upgrade the dock equipment, as well as to grant amnesty to the strikers. When the stunned Zento protests that this move is not in the spirit of the Rush Act, Sinclair dismisses it by noting that the phrase &quot;any means necessary&quot; in the law clearly allows him to fully acquiesce to the strikers&#x27; demands to resolve the situation. As for the workers, they are delighted at this unexpectedly swift victory and agree to immediately resume their duties.

Meanwhile, Mollari demands retribution against G&#x27;Kar for the stolen Centauri artifact. Sinclair changes the subject and informs Mollari that the G&#x27;Quan Eth is a controlled substance only allowed for medical or religious purposes, and must be impounded. Molari agrees to give up the plant. G&#x27;Kar despairs, saying that Mollari only did so because it is too late to perform the religious ceremony: it must be performed when the rays of sunlight touch the G&#x27;Quan Mountain at a specific time of the year. Sinclair reminds him that the rules of the ritual predate Narns traveling between the stars, so there is now a loophole: the light from 10 Narn years ago is still traveling and is now about to reach Babylon 5, so G&#x27;Kar can perform the ritual with the required rays of sunlight. A delighted G&#x27;Kar thanks Sinclair and assures him the Centauri artifact will be returned. As such, G&#x27;Kar makes his preparations and performs his religious observance with some careful timing for the anticipated light&#x27;s arrival.

==Writing==
This episode was written by Kathryn M. Drennan, wife at the time of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator and executive producer J. Michael Straczynski. She had previously written television scripts, mainly for animated programs, and had worked as a journalist for magazines such as &quot;Twilight Zone Magazine&quot; and &quot;Women&#x27;s World&quot;. In order to avoid the appearance of favoritism, Straczynski had her submit (rather than be assigned) a full script, and required it to be approved by others in the production crew other than him. Unlike other writers, for whom Straczynski revised scripts himself, revisions of Drennan&#x27;s script mostly went through story editor Larry DiTillio instead. Straczynski wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a very intense script in which we basically put Sinclair through the wringer for 48 hours and try and make him absolutely nuts. And succeed, for the most part.&quot; Drennan later wrote the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; novel, &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot;, which follows Jeffery Sinclair&#x27;s story after he leaves the station after season 1.

The Matewan Massacre referred to by Neeoma Connally was a 1920 industrial confrontation between coal mine workers and the mine company, which brought in a private detective agency to settle the dispute. Events resulted in a shootout in which several people died. The fictional Rush Act was named by Drennan after the conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.

==Production ==
===Cast and filming===
According to Straczynski, a number of people involved in the production, including lead actor Michael O&#x27;Hare, regard the episode as their favorite so far.

The role of union representative Neeoma Connally was played by American actress Katy Boyer, while John Snyder played the character of Orin Zento. Snyder played the second Soul Hunter in the earlier episode, &quot;Soul Hunter&quot;. Straczynski regarded both of their performances as being very good. 

The part of dock foreman Eduardo Delvientos was played by Jose Rey, with Earth Senator Hidoshi – who appears several times in Season 1 – being played by actor and singer-songwriter Aki Aleong. Aleong last played the same character in &#x27;Deathwalker&#x27;. &quot;Babylon 5&quot; intentionally cast a large number of non-white actors in various roles. Straczynski wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s been my belief, and I&#x27;ll say it again, that if we go to the stars at all, we&#x27;re all going... or no one&#x27;s going.&quot; 

The episode was directed by Jim Johnston, who previously directed the episodes, &quot;Soul Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Survivors&quot;. Johnston also appears as the dock worker who yells, &quot;I say we strike!. The original script didn&#x27;t actually include scenes of the workers striking. Johnston noticed this and requested the inclusion of a worker calling his colleagues to strike. Johnston was told the budget had already been finalised and it wasn&#x27;t possible to include another day actor. So Johnston decided to step in on the last day of filming and play the role himself. About twenty members of the production staff were also dragged in front of the camera by Johnston, and appear in the episode as members of the crowd. 

Commander Sinclair&#x27;s unshaven, run-down appearance in this episode actually began because actor Michael O&#x27;Hare had only just arrived in California from New York where he&#x27;d had to be for the weekend. Director Jim Johnston thought that O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s performance was particularly good when he was tired, so he instructed O&#x27;Hare to stay up late, and didn&#x27;t allow him to shave for the rest of the week.

===Visual effects===
&quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes in a television series, with the visual effects for season 1 were created by Foundation Imaging using Commodore Amiga computers with LightWave 3D software. Visual effects team leader Ron Thornton, who worked on both &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes during his career, wrote that the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; visual effects budgets were around one tenth of the corresponding &quot;Star Trek&quot; budgets, but that &quot;Babylon 5&quot; effects were &quot;...much more fun to do.&quot;

The design for Earth transport shuttle – seen rising on an elevator in front of the Narn transport ship before the docking bay accident – was digitally created by Thornton as a variation of a physical miniature for a shuttle which he had built before he had worked for the BBC. The original miniature had been used as a shuttle in the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode, &quot;Orbit&quot;. 

The freighter ships seen outside the station waiting to dock during the dock workers&#x27; strike were created digitally by Foundation Imaging artists taking parts from previously created ships, described by digital animator Mark Kochinski as &quot;kitbashing&quot;. The central hull tubes were modelled by Thornton, and the cargo pods were created by Kochinski, who writes that some of the ships seem to have a re-colored bridge taken from the Earth president&#x27;s ship, &quot;Earthforce One&quot;, which appeared in the previous episode, &quot;Survivors&quot;.

===Music===
Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race.

==Story arc significance==
Reviewer Elias Rosner notes that In this episode, elements introduced in the first half of the season begin to become relevant to the unfolding of the characters, and to coming plot lines. Centauri ambassador Mollari&#x27;s toying with Ambassador G&#x27;Kar is a response to the Narn capture of the Centauri outpost on Ragesh 3 in the first episode of the season, &quot;Midnight on the Firing Line&quot;. 

Author Jane Killick highlights the development of G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s character – the process having begun in &quot;Mind War&quot; –: for the first time in the series he is portrayed as having a deeply religious character, with his role as the senior Narn official on the station bringing with it the role of being the religious leader for the Narn on Babylon 5. In a similar vein, Straczynski notes that while previously, G&#x27;Kar, in his struggle with Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari, was the one portraying negatively, continually baiting Londo, G&#x27;Kar is painted in positive light in this relationship for the first time. 

Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; points out that the episode highlights that things on back home on Earth are going seriously wrong in the political arena: the villain isn&#x27;t a shadowy figure, but rather the budget committee in the Earth Senate. The Earth Senate&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Sinclair&#x27;s leadership style and handling of situations had been building up for weeks: Elias Rosner writes, &quot;Things are changing back on Earth, not always for the better. What comes next is going to be an interesting time for sure.

Rowan Kaiser writes that the story is in one sense a continuation of &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot; – where religious ceremonies of the major races were depicted – with this episode finally showing the Narn religious ceremony that was left out. The episode also refers to the ancient Narn religious text, the &quot;Book of G&#x27;Quan&quot; for the first time in series. The book will have a significant role in the overarching storyline.

==Commentaries and reviews==
Sherryl Vint, in her essay, &quot;&quot;Babylon 5&quot;: Our First, Best Hope for Mature Science Fiction Television&#x27; highlights &quot;Babylon 5&quot;&#x27;s complex vision of the future – contrasted with the static depictions of future civilisation which typify many science fiction programs – a future, with flawed human characters &quot;...who struggle with alcoholism, drug addiction, failed love affairs, greed, weakness, fear, selfishness, and the like&quot;. She writes that the episode underscores that the conflicts are &quot;...not only life-or-death encounters with ancient forces, but also familiar struggles with Senate subcommittees and resource allocation.&quot;

Writers Ensley Guffey and Dale Koontz describe this episode as &quot;the closest thing to a monster-of-the-week episode thus far,&quot; but note the twist: that the &#x27;monster&#x27; is the bureaucracy and budget process behind the running of the station. They describe the episode for being &quot;brilliant for again refusing to paint a picture of the future in which all socio-political problems have been solved.&quot;

Reviewer Rowan Kaiser writes that this episode was, &quot;a pleasant surprise&quot;, as he was not expecting an episode which is inessential to the overall series plot to be of such high quality. He regards it as his favorite episode so far in the series.

Kaiser also praises the characters in the episode. He notes that it brought out the best in both Michael O&#x27;Hare and Jerry Doyle&#x27;s characters, Commander Sinclair and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi, respectively, and highlighting a moment where, upon hearing Senator Hidoshi&#x27;s report during a communication with Earth, Sinclair and Garibaldi share a small knowing glance at each other, knowing full well the ramifications they will have to suffer. Kaiser also notes the character of union representative Neeoma Connally, who has the difficult role of representing blue-collar workers on the station to the white-collar station leadership. Kaiser writes about feeling &quot;sad upon remembering that she wasn&#x27;t an important recurring character.&quot;

Kaiser highlights the tension between Sinclair and Garibaldi&#x27;s sympathy for the dock workers&#x27; cause, with their role as representatives of EarthGov, where they will be forced against their will to be good soldiers. He writes, &quot;Everything leading toward the climax indicates that this is going to be a mess.&quot; Kaiser points out that the Senate allowed Sinclair&#x27;s resolution, not because they agreed with him, but because it was popular in the polls: meaning that the Senate in no longer representative of the people, but serving the interests of those in power. Kaiser sums up the episode, saying it is, &quot;...tight, smart, and morally ambiguous in a way that makes &quot;Babylon 5&quot; fell distinct. Don&#x27;t skip this one.&quot;

Elias Rosner, writing in the entertainment magazine website &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot; in 2018, comments on the contemporary nature of the issues in the episode, observing that it &quot;could have been written yesterday.&quot; He writes that the problems are issues we experienced then, and still experience now.

Rosner also finds it interesting to watch to see what each party in the conflict wants, and what they can do, pointing out that Connally and Sinclair both want the same thing, but notes that &quot;...Sinclair&#x27;s hands are tied which means so are Connally&#x27;s.&quot; Whereas the Senate, with a primary concern for Babylon 5&#x27;s military purposes, doesn&#x27;t care about the welfare of the workers, sending Zento, who has no interest in negotiating in good faith.

Rosner found the secondary plot line – concerning G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s efforts to obtain the G&#x27;Quan Eth plant for his religious ceremony – compelling. Rosner was intrigued to know what would come next, wondering what G&#x27;Kar would resort to, asking how desperate was he, and what humanity he would show in his struggle with Londo, whilst noting that Londo is both in the right, but also being annoyingly and unreasonably difficult. Rosner writes, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing extraordinary but it does just what it should do: entertain, expand on the [characters], and intersect the main plot just enough to tie the two together.&quot;

Rosner sums up by saying that both sub-plots are about finding peace in conflict, and both resolutions are achieved by exploiting loopholes: the first being against a harsh law, but the second being in a spirit of celebration.

<text>Clovis IV ( 677–694/695) was the king of the Franks from 690 or 691 until his death. If the brief reign of Clovis III (675) is ignored as a usurpation, then Clovis IV may be numbered Clovis III.

A member of the Merovingian dynasty, Clovis was the son of King Theuderic III and Queen Chrodochild. He was born around 677 or possibly towards 682. He succeeded his father as the sole ruler of the Franks upon the latter&#x27;s death in 690 or 691. He ruled an undivided kingdom including Austrasia, Burgundy and Neustria. According to the &quot;Annals of Metz&quot;, a pro-Pippinid source, he was appointed by Pippin of Herstal, the mayor of the palace of Austrasia, and reigned four years.

Clovis was a minor at his accession, and real power was in Pippin&#x27;s hands. His minority, coming as it did on the heels of his father&#x27;s efforts to strengthen royal power, was an important factor in the decline of the Merovingian dynasty. Clovis resided primarily in Compiègne (the traditional site of the Marchfield) and Montmacq.

Nine of Clovis&#x27;s charters have been edited and published. Four of them are records of &quot;placita&quot; (public judicial hearings) held in the king&#x27;s presence. Despite the rise of Pippin and his family, which is a major theme of the &quot;Annals of Metz&quot;, the royal court was still important in Clovis&#x27;s reign. During a &quot;placitum&quot; in Valenciennes in 693, Clovis was attended by twelve bishops, twelve &quot;viri illustres&quot; (including Nordebert, the Neustrian mayor of the palace), nine counts and numerous other officials. The future Neustrian mayor of the palace Ragamfred started out as a &quot;domesticus&quot; under Clovis. Warno, the Neustrian &quot;comes palatii&quot; of Chilperic II, also began his career at the court of Clovis.

In 692, Clovis confirmed for the Abbey of Saint-Denis the right to collect certain tolls in Marseille, a right which it had been granted by Dagobert I. He also granted to the Abbey of Saint-Médard the nearby house that had been the primary residence of the former mayor of the palace, Ebroin, in Soissons.

The anonymous continuator of the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; devotes two sentences to Clovis IV: &quot;King Theuderic died ... and his little son Clovis was chosen to succeed him as king. But it was not long before King Clovis fell ill and died, having reigned four years.&quot; He died in either 694 or 695. He was succeeded by his brother, Childebert III. Clovis does not appear to have made much of an impression on his contemporaries; his brother was more highly regarded.

<text>By any means necessary is an English phrase, or a translation of a French phrase that has been attributed to at least three famous sources. The earliest of these three sources is French leftist intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre in his 1948 play &quot;Dirty Hands&quot; where he used a French equivalent of the phrase. The second is Martinican anticolonialist intellectual Frantz Fanon who used another French equivalent of the phrase in his 1960 address to the Positive Action Conference in Accra, Ghana. The English phrase entered American civil rights culture through a speech given by Muslim minister Malcolm X at the Organization of Afro-American Unity&#x27;s founding rally on 28 June 1964 in Manhattan, New York.

The phrase is generally considered to mean to leave open the option of all available tactics, strategies or methods for attaining or achieving desired ends, including any form or degree of violence as well as other methods typically considered unethical or immoral. It is part of a broader political idea that radical social change or liberation cannot be obtained by limiting one’s means to that which are considered &quot;acceptable&quot;, debatably encapsulated in the suggestion by Audre Lorde that &quot;The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house&quot;.

== Jean-Paul Sartre ==
The phrase is also a translation of a sentence used in French intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s 1948 play &quot;Dirty Hands&quot;:

== Frantz Fanon ==
The phrase is a translation of a sentence used in revolutionary philosopher Frantz Fanon&#x27;s 1960 address to the Positive Action Conference for Peace and Security in Africa in Accra, Ghana, &quot;Why we use violence&quot;, defending armed resistance against the colonial French as part of the Algerian War:

== Malcolm X ==
It entered the popular culture through speeches given by Malcolm X (El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz), founder of Muslim Mosque, Inc. and Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), in the last year of his life. Its most prominent example was during the founding rally of the OAAU in 1964.


=== Mandela recusal ===
In the final scene of the 1992 movie &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, Nelson Mandela—then recently released after 27 years of political imprisonment—appears as a schoolteacher in a Soweto classroom reciting Malcolm X&#x27;s speech. Yet Mandela informed director Spike Lee that he could not utter the famous final phrase &quot;by any means necessary&quot; on camera, fearing that the apartheid government would use it against him if he did. Lee obliged, and the final seconds of the film feature black-and-white footage of Malcolm X himself delivering the phrase.

<text>Isachsen is a remote Arctic research-weather station named after the Norwegian explorer of the Arctic Gunnar Isachsen. It is on the western shore of Ellef Ringnes Island in the Sverdrup Islands, in the territory of Nunavut in Canada. Isachsen Station was established to participate in a joint Canadian-American weather observation program. Isachsen Station operated from April 3, 1948, through September 19, 1978. Regular weather observations began on May 3, 1948. In October 1949, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (tail number 316062) crash-landed near the station. No one was killed, but three on board were injured. The wreckage has been preserved by the cold weather and dry conditions.

==Climate==
According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, Isachsen and the surrounding area has the worst weather in Canada with a Climate Severity Index of 99 out of a possible 100. The climate of Isachsen is a severe tundra climate, with short, cool summers and long, cold winters. The record high is on July 21, 1962, and the record low is on March 16, 1956.

==Flora and fauna==
There are no trees or shrubs that can live this far north. The plant life here is limited to small patches of moss, lichens, and a few tiny flowering plants. The wildlife here is limited to polar bears, Arctic foxes, caribou, Arctic hares, lemmings, seals, muskoxen, and migratory birds.

==History and background==
On October 9, 1949, a C-47 cargo plane of the United States Air Force crashed on takeoff at the weather station. The plane had ten people on board: a US Air Force crew of six and four civilian passengers. The passengers were two U.S. weather bureau employees, a Canadian weather bureau employee, and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable. Three of the aircrew received cuts and bruises and everyone else escaped injury. The subsequent investigation blamed the accident on the plane being overloaded and attempting to take off with ice building up on the cockpit windshield and wings. At the time of the crash, there were of snow on the mud runway, a light snowfall and some fog. The wreck was briefly shown in the Polar Special episode of the BBC program &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Photos of the remains of Isachsen Station can be seen on the Hilux Arctic Challenge website, taken by the &quot;Top Gear&quot; team on their trip to the nearby 1996 North Magnetic Pole. The footage of the wreck was filmed on May 2, 2007. The episode first aired on July 25, 2007. The wreck site is located at .

During the 1950s, Isachsen Station was primarily collecting radiosonde observations. Along with weather soundings from similar stations such as Mould Bay, Eureka, and Alert, this information was used to complete the North American data, primarily used to produce weather forecasts over the North Atlantic Ocean, Greenland, and Iceland, and long-range weather forecasts for Western Europe.

The Isachsen Station was in an extremely isolated place, with supplies and new personnel flown in by the Royal Canadian Air Force, usually twice a year: in the late spring, and again in the early fall from an air base (now Resolute Bay Airport) at Resolute on Cornwallis Island. In turn, Resolute Station, like most northern communities, was supplied using ocean-going cargo ships aided by icebreakers during the late summer sealift.

The eight-man staff at Isachsen usually consisted of four Americans and four Canadians. The Americans were usually two weather observers, a cook, and a mechanic. The Canadians were usually two weather observers and two radio operators. All communication to and from Isachsen Station was via shortwave radio radiotelegraphy.

Fuel oil and diesel fuel for heating and cooking, and for the station&#x27;s electric generators, respectively, were shipped to Isachsen by transport planes in standard metal fuel barrels.

During the summer of 1958, the Isachsen station was rebuilt using prefabricated buildings that had been airlifted in along with about a dozen construction personnel. The sun sets in October and it is totally dark for about three months with temperatures from . In the summer, the sun is visible above the horizon 24 hours a day for about three months with temperatures from about .

In 1956, a plan by the Government of Canada to resettle the Inuit at several high Arctic locations was scrapped. These settlements would have included Isachsen, Alert, Eureka, and Mould Bay.

On October 31, 1971, the United States withdrew from participation in the weather program at the site. In 1971, the Canadian government made a significant investment in Isachsen to upgrade its buildings. Then, in 1978, as a cost-cutting measure, the government decided to close one high Arctic station; Isachsen Station was selected, and it was closed down during that same year. The last manned weather observations were taken on July 31, 1978. An Automated Surface Observing System was placed at the site in 1989, linked by satellite communications to southern Canada. Isachsen is now uninhabited.

During the summers of 1989 and 1992, the closed weather station at Isachsen was the site of the High Arctic Psychology Research Station (HAPRS). The HAPRS operated under the aegis of the Polar Psychology Project, an international and transpolar multi-year program. Each time, six or seven researchers used each other as participants in investigations of the effects of isolation, remoteness, and cold on psychological and physiological processes such as taste perception, irritability, mood, subjective and hormonal measures of stress, brain waves, and sleep patterns. In 1992, a survey was made of abandoned vehicles, fuel drums, and potential contaminants to assist Environment and Climate Change Canada in planning to remove such items from the site.

<text>John of Nepomuk (or John Nepomucene) (; ; ) ( 1345 – 20 March 1393)
was a saint of Bohemia (Czech Republic) who was drowned in the Vltava river at the behest of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. Later accounts state that he was the confessor of the queen of Bohemia and refused to divulge the secrets of the confessional. On the basis of this account, John of Nepomuk is considered the first martyr of the Seal of the Confessional, a patron against calumnies and, because of the manner of his death, a protector from floods and drowning.

==Basic biographical information==
Jan z Pomuku came from the small market town of &quot;Pomuk&quot; (later renamed Nepomuk) in Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, which belonged to the nearby Cistercian abbey.

Born in the 1340s, his father was called &quot;Velflín,&quot; while his mother is unknown. His father&#x27;s name was probably derived from the German name &quot;Wolfgang&quot;.

Jan first studied at the University of Prague, then furthered his studies in canon law at the University of Padua from 1383 to 1387. In 1393, he was made vicar-general of Saint Giles Cathedral by Jan of Jenštejn, Archbishop of Prague. 

 At issue was the appointment of a new abbot for the rich and powerful Benedictine Abbey of Kladruby in 1393; its abbot was a territorial magnate whose resources would be crucial to Wenceslaus in his struggles with nobles. Wenceslaus was backing the Avignon pope Clement VII, whereas the archbishop followed his rival, the Pope in Rome, Boniface IX. Contrary to the wishes of Wenceslaus, John confirmed the archbishop&#x27;s candidate for Abbot of Kladruby. On 20 March 1393, he was tortured and thrown into the River Vltava from the Charles Bridge in Prague by order of King Wenceslaus IV.

This account is based on four contemporary documents. The first is the accusation of the king, presented to Pope Boniface IX on 23 April 1393, by Archbishop Jan of Jenštejn, who immediately went to Rome together with the new Abbot of Kladruby.

A few years later, Abbott Ladolf of Sagan listed John of Nepomuk in the catalog of Sagan abbots, completed in 1398, as well as in the treatise &quot;&quot;De longævo schismate&quot;, lib. VII, c. xix.

A further document is the &quot;Chronik des Deutschordens&quot;&quot;/&quot;Chronik des Landes Preussen&quot;, a chronicle of the Teutonic Order compiled by John of Posilge, who died in 1405.

In the above accusation, Jan of Jenštejn already calls John of Nepomuk a &quot;holy martyr&quot;. The biography of the bishop (written by his chaplain) describes John of Nepomuk as &quot;gloriosum Christi martyrem miraculisque coruscum&quot; (English: &quot;a glorious martyr of Christ and sparkling with miracles&quot;).

Thus, the priest put to death for defending the laws and autonomy of the Catholic Church became revered as a saint directly after his death.

==Later accounts==

Much additional biographical information comes from Bohemian annalists who wrote 60 or more years after the events they recount. Although they may have taken advantage of sources not available today, their contribution is considered legendary by many historians, particularly by the Protestant ones.

*In his chronicle &quot;Chronica regum Romanorum&quot;, completed in 1459, Thomas Ebendorfer (d. 1464) states that King Wenceslaus had drowned the confessor (the priest who heard the confession) of the queen, indicated as &quot;Magister Jan&quot;, because Jan had stated that &quot;only the one who rules properly deserves the name of king&quot; and had refused to betray the seal of Confession. This is the first source to mention this refusal as a motivation of the condemnation of John of Nepomuk.
* In his &quot;Instructions for the King&quot;, completed in 1471, Paul Zidek provides further details. King Wenceslaus was afraid that his wife had a lover. As she was used to confessing to &quot;Magister Jan&quot;, King Wenceslaus ordered him to reveal the name of the lover, but to no avail. Therefore, the king ordered John to be drowned. Note that in these chronicles neither the date of the events nor the name of the queen is mentioned.
* In 1483 John of Krumlov, dean of St. Vitus cathedral, states that John died in 1383 (one decade earlier than the recognized date, perhaps due to a transcription error). As the first wife of Wenceslaus died in 1386, this change of date also causes uncertainty about the name of the queen.

The mistake of John of Krumlov crept into the of Wenceslaus Hajek of Liboczan (Václav Hájek z Libočan), the &quot;Bohemian Livy&quot;. He suggested that two Jan di Nepomuks may have existed and have both been killed by King Wenceslaus. The first one is the queen&#x27;s confessor, who died in 1383; the other the vicar of the archbishop, who disagreed with the king on the election of the abbot of Kladruby and was drowned in 1393. As Hajek&#x27;s annals enjoyed a wide success, they influenced all subsequent historians for two centuries, up to the Latin edition, critically annotated by the translator, which considerably reduced Hajek&#x27;s credit as a reliable historian.

Further and less reliable details about John of Nepomuk come from the annalists of the 17th and 18th centuries. Boleslaus Balbinus, S.J., in his gives the most rich account.

Although the theory of Hajek of Liboczan has no credit today, some historians believe the vicar&#x27;s refusal to betray the seal of the confessional might have been the secret reason why Wenceslaus took vengeance on John of Nepomuk as soon as a credible excuse provided the opportunity.

==A controversial figure==

Catholics see John of Nepomuk as a martyr to the cause of defending the Seal of the Confessional. Romantic nationalists regard him as a Czech martyr to imperial interference. Most historians present him as a victim of a late version of the inveterate investiture controversy between secular rulers and the Catholic hierarchy.

The connection of John of Nepomuk with the inviolability of the confessional is part of the transformation of a historical figure into a legend, which can be traced through successive stages. The archbishop, who hastened to Rome soon after the crime, in his charge against Wenceslaus, called the victim a martyr; in the &quot;vita&quot; written a few years later miracles are already recorded, by which the drowned man was discovered. About the middle of the 15th century the statement appears for the first time that the refusal to violate the seal of confession was the cause of John&#x27;s death. Two decades later (1471), the dean of Prague, Paul Zidek, makes John the queen&#x27;s confessor. The chronicler Wenceslaus Hajek speaks in 1541 (perhaps due to an incorrect reading of his sources) of &quot;two&quot; Johns of Nepomuk being drowned; the first as confessor, the second for his confirmation of the abbot.
The legend is especially indebted for its growth to the Jesuit historiographer Boleslaus Balbinus the &quot;Bohemian Pliny&quot;, whose &quot;Vita beati Joannis Nepomuceni martyris&quot; was published in Prague, 1670. Although the Prague metropolitan chapter did not accept the biography dedicated to it, &quot;as being frequently destitute of historical foundation and erroneous, a bungling work of mythological rhetoric&quot;, Balbinus stuck to it. In 1683 the Charles Bridge was adorned with a statue of the saint, which has had numerous successors; in 1708 the first church was dedicated to him at Hradec Králové; a more famous Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk was founded in 1719.

Meanwhile, in spite of the objection of the Jesuits, the process was inaugurated which ended with his canonisation. On 31 May 1721, he was beatified, and on 19 March 1729, he was canonised under Pope Benedict XIII. The acts of the process, comprising 500 pages, distinguish two Johns of Nepomuk and sanction the &quot;cult&quot; of the one who was drowned in 1383 as a martyr of the sacrament of penance.

According to some Protestant sources, the figure of John Nepomuk is a legend due to Jesuits and that its historical kernel is really Jan Hus, who was metamorphosed from a Bohemian Reformer into a Roman Catholic saint: the Nepomuk story would be based on Wenceslaus Hajek&#x27;s blending of the Jan who was drowned in 1393 and the Jan who was burned in 1415. The resemblances are certainly striking, extending to the manner of celebrating their commemorations. But when the Jesuits came to Prague, the Nepomuk veneration had long been widespread; and the idea of canonization originated in opposition not to the Hussites, but to Protestantism, as a weapon of the Counter-Reformation. In the image of the saint which gradually arose is reflected the religious history of Bohemia.

A coincidental drought in the region a year later helped the legend along; the church convinced the peasants that the drought represented God&#x27;s punishment for the killing of Jan Nepomucký. Building on that success, the church attempted to portray the king in a more negative light. Certain clerical circles spread reports of John&#x27;s courage, saying that as confessor to the Queen he had refused to reveal her secrets, and that was why he had been murdered. Belief in John&#x27;s supernatural powers culminated with the discovery of his supposed tongue when three centuries later his tomb was opened and a piece of reddened tissue fell out of his skull.

==Veneration==
The cult of St. John of Nepomuk grew in the 17th century and spread during 17th and 18th centuries from Bohemia into many Catholic countries, especially to those ruled by or having ties to the Habsburg family. Statues of St. John of Nepomuk, churches consecrated to him and settlements bearing his name can be found not only in Central Europe (where they are most common), but also in many other European countries and further beyond in the Americas and in India.

Worldwide, statues of John of Nepomuk number in tens of thousands, making John of Nepomuk the most represented Czech person in visual art. In Czechia alone, there are around 6000 statues. Similar numbers are in Austria and Germany, and smaller numbers in other parts of the former Habsburg Empire. Individual statues or other monuments can be found in almost every country with a significant Catholic tradition.

Most of those statues are located on bridges (due to John of Nepomuk being a patron saint of bridges and against drowning) and are modelled according to the famous John of Nepomuk statue on the Charles Bridge in Prague. He is usually portrayed with a halo with five stars, alluding to the legend about stars that hovered over his dead body when it was found on the bank of the Vltava river. His tomb, a Baroque monument cast in silver and silver-gilt that was designed by Josef Emanuel Fischer of Erlach, stands in St Vitus Cathedral, Prague.

He has been common baptismal saint in Czech lands, his name bore among other saint John Nepomucene Neumann.

<text>Mutation is a genetic operator used to maintain genetic diversity of the chromosomes of a population of an evolutionary algorithm (EA), including genetic algorithms in particular. It is analogous to biological mutation.

The classic example of a mutation operator of a binary coded genetic algorithm (GA) involves a probability that an arbitrary bit in a genetic sequence will be flipped from its original state. A common method of implementing the mutation operator involves generating a random variable for each bit in a sequence. This random variable tells whether or not a particular bit will be flipped. This mutation procedure, based on the biological point mutation, is called single point mutation. Other types of mutation operators are commonly used for representations other than binary, such as floating-point encodings or representations for combinatorial problems.

The purpose of mutation in EAs is to introduce diversity into the sampled population. Mutation operators are used in an attempt to avoid local minima by preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming too similar to each other, thus slowing or even stopping convergence to the global optimum. This reasoning also leads most EAs to avoid only taking the fittest of the population in generating the next generation, but rather selecting a random (or semi-random) set with a weighting toward those that are fitter.

The following requirements apply to all mutation operators used in an EA:
# every point in the search space must be reachable by one or more mutations.
# there must be no preference for parts or directions in the search space (no drift).
# small mutations should be more probable than large ones.

For different genome types, different mutation types are suitable. Some mutations are Gaussian, Uniform, Zigzag, Scramble, Insertion, Inversion, Swap, and so on. An overview and more operators than those presented below can be found in the introductory book by Eiben and Smith or in.

== Bit string mutation ==
The mutation of bit strings ensue through bit flips at random positions.

Example:
The probability of a mutation of a bit is formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of the binary vector. Thus, a mutation rate of formula_3 per mutation and individual selected for mutation is reached.

== Mutation of real numbers ==
Many EAs, such as the evolution strategy or the real-coded genetic algorithms, work with real numbers instead of bit strings. This is due to the good experiences that have been made with this type of coding.

The value of a real-valued gene can either be changed or redetermined. A mutation that implements the latter should only ever be used in conjunction with the value-changing mutations and then only with comparatively low probability, as it can lead to large changes.

In practical applications, the respective value range of the decision variables to be changed of the optimisation problem to be solved is usually limited. Accordingly, the values of the associated genes are each restricted to an interval formula_4. Mutations may or may not take these restrictions into account. In the latter case, suitable post-treatment is then required as described below.

=== Mutation without consideration of restrictions ===

A real number formula_5 can be mutated using normal distribution formula_6 by adding the generated random value to the old value of the gene, resulting in the mutated value formula_7:formula_8In the case of genes with a restricted range of values, it is a good idea to choose the step size of the mutation formula_9 so that it reasonably fits the range formula_4 of the gene to be changed, e.g.:formula_11The step size can also be adjusted to the smaller permissible change range depending on the current value. In any case, however, it is likely that the new value formula_7 of the gene will be outside the permissible range of values. Such a case must be considered a lethal mutation, since the obvious repair by using the respective violated limit as the new value of the gene would lead to a drift. This is because the limit value would then be selected with the entire probability of the values beyond the limit of the value range. 

The evolution strategy works with real numbers and mutation based on normal distribution. The step sizes are part of the chromosome and are subject to evolution together with the actual decision variables.

=== Mutation with consideration of restrictions ===
One possible form of changing the value of a gene while taking its value range formula_4 into account is the mutation &quot;relative parameter change&quot; of the evolutionary algorithm GLEAM (General Learning Evolutionary Algorithm and Method), in which, as with the mutation presented earlier, small changes are more likely than large ones.

First, an equally distributed decision is made as to whether the current value formula_5 should be increased or decreased and then the corresponding total change interval is determined. Without loss of generality, an increase is assumed for the explanation and the total change interval is then formula_15. It is divided into formula_16 sub-areas of equal size with the width formula_17, from which formula_16 sub-change intervals of different size are formed:
:formula_19-th sub-change interval: formula_20 with
:formula_21 and formula_22
Subsequently, one of the formula_16 sub-change intervals is selected in equal distribution and a random number, also equally distributed, is drawn from it as the new value formula_7 of the gene. The resulting summed probabilities of the sub-change intervals result in the probability distribution of the formula_16 sub-areas shown in the adjacent figure for the exemplary case of formula_26. This is not a normal distribution as before, but this distribution also clearly favours small changes over larger ones. 

This mutation for larger values of formula_16, such as 10, is less well suited for tasks where the optimum lies on one of the value range boundaries. This can be remedied by significantly reducing formula_16 when a gene value approaches its limits very closely.

=== Common properties ===
For both mutation operators for real-valued numbers, the probability of an increase and decrease is independent of the current value and is 50% in each case. In addition, small changes are considerably more likely than large ones. For mixed-integer optimization problems, rounding is usually used. 

== Mutation of permutations ==
Mutations of permutations are specially designed for genomes that are themselves permutations of a set. These are often used to solve combinatorial tasks. In the two mutations presented, parts of the genome are rotated or inverted.

=== Rotation to the right ===
The presentation of the procedure is illustrated by an example on the right:
=== Inversion ===
The presentation of the procedure is illustrated by an example on the right:
=== Variants with preference for smaller changes ===
The requirement raised at the beginning for mutations, according to which small changes should be more probable than large ones, is only inadequately fulfilled by the two permutation mutations presented, since the lengths of the partial lists and the number of shift positions are determined in an equally distributed manner. However, the longer the partial list and the shift, the greater the change in gene order.

This can be remedied by the following modifications. The end index formula_29 of the partial lists is determined as the distance formula_30 to the start index formula_19:
:formula_32
where formula_30 is determined randomly according to one of the two procedures for the mutation of real numbers from the interval formula_34 and rounded.

For the &quot;rotation&quot;, formula_16 is determined similarly to the distance formula_30, but the value formula_37 is forbidden.

For the &quot;inversion&quot;, note that formula_38 must hold, so for formula_30 the value formula_37 must be excluded.

<doc id="555225" wikidata="Q9622" url="?curid=555225" title="Scalp">
<text>The scalp is the area of the head where head hair grows. It is made up of skin, layers of connective and fibrous tissues, and the membrane of the skull. Anatomically, the scalp is part of the epicranium, a collection of structures covering the cranium. The scalp is bordered by the face at the front, and by the neck at the sides and back. The scientific study of hair and scalp is called trichology.

==Structure==
===Layers===
The scalp is usually described as having five layers, which can be remembered using the mnemonic &#x27;SCALP&#x27;:
* S: Skin. The skin of the scalp contains numerous hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
* C: Connective tissue. A dense subcutaneous layer of fat and fibrous tissue that lies beneath the skin, containing the nerves and vessels of the scalp.
* A: Aponeurosis. The epicranial aponeurosis or galea aponeurotica is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue which anchors the above layers in place. It runs from the frontalis muscle anteriorly to the occipitalis posteriorly.
* L: Loose areolar connective tissue. This layer has a gel-like consistency, and allows the more superficial layers of the scalp to shift about in relation to the pericranium. It is constituted of more matrix than fibers. It contains and is rich in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). In craniofacial surgery and neurosurgery this layer provides an easy plane of separation between the upper three layers and the pericranium. In scalping the scalp is also torn off through this layer. The layer is sometimes referred to as the &quot;danger zone&quot; because infectious agents can easily spread through it to emissary veins which drain into the cranium. 
* P: Pericranium. This is the periosteum of the skull bones, a membrane that provides nutrition to the bone and the capacity for repair. During surgery it can be lifted from the bone to allow the removal of windows of bone (craniotomy).

===Blood supply===
The blood supply of the scalp is via five pairs of arteries, three from the external carotid and two from the internal carotid:
* internal carotid
** the supratrochlear artery to the midline forehead. The supratrochlear artery is a branch of the ophthalmic branch of the internal carotid artery.
** the supraorbital artery to the lateral forehead and scalp as far up as the vertex. The supraorbital artery is a branch of the ophthalmic branch of the internal carotid artery.
* external carotid
** the superficial temporal artery gives off frontal and parietal branches to supply much of the scalp
** the occipital artery which runs posteriorly to supply much of the posterior aspect of the scalp
** the posterior auricular artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, ascends behind the auricle to supply the scalp above and behind the auricle.
Because the walls of the blood vessels are firmly attached to the fibrous tissue of the superficial fascial layer, cut ends of vessels here do not readily retract; even a small scalp wound may bleed profusely.

Venous drainage
The veins of the scalp accompany the arteries and thus have similar names, e.g. Supratrochlear and supraorbital veins, which unite at the medial angle of the eye, and form the angular vein, which further continues as the facial vein.

The superficial temporal vein descends in front of the tragus, enters the parotid gland, and then joins the maxillary vein to form the retromandibular vein. The anterior part of it unites with the facial vein to form the common facial vein, which drains into jugular vein, and ultimately to the subclavian vein. The occipital vein terminates to the sub-occipital plexus.

There are other veins, like the emissary vein and frontal diploic vein, which also contribute to the venous drainage.

===Nerve supply===
Innervation is the connection of nerves to the scalp: the sensory and motor nerves innervating the scalp. The scalp is innervated by the following:
* Supratrochlear nerve and the supraorbital nerve from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve
* Greater occipital nerve (C2) posteriorly up to the vertex
* Lesser occipital nerve (C2) behind the ear
* Zygomaticotemporal nerve from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve supplying the hairless temple
* Auriculotemporal nerve from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve

The innervation of scalp can be remembered using the mnemonic &#x27;Z-GLASS&#x27; for Zygomaticotemporal nerve, Greater occipital nerve, Lesser occipital nerve, Auriculotemporal nerve, Supratrochlear nerve, and Supraorbital nerve.

The motor innervation of the scalp, specifically, the occipitofrontalis muscle, is split into two main factions: the frontal belly or frontalis muscle is supplied by the temporal branch of facial nerve, while the occipital belly or occipitalis is supplied by the posterior auricular branch of facial nerve.

===Lymphatic drainage===
Lymphatic channels from the posterior half of the scalp drain to occipital and posterior auricular nodes. Lymphatic channels from the anterior half drain to the parotid nodes. The lymph eventually reaches the submandibular and deep cervical nodes.

==Clinical significance==
===Infection===
The &#x27;danger area of the scalp&#x27; is the area of loose connective tissue. This is because pus and blood spread easily within it, and can pass into the cranial cavity along the emissary veins. Therefore, infection can spread from the scalp to the meninges, which could lead to meningitis.further studies are needed to conclude that it’s actually a “danger zone” though.

===Injury===
The clinically important layer is the aponeurosis. Scalp lacerations through this layer mean that the &quot;anchoring&quot; of the superficial layers is lost and gaping of the wound occurs which would require suturing. This can be achieved with simple or vertical mattress sutures using a non-absorbable material, which are subsequently removed at around days 7–10.

===Hair transplantation===
All the current hair transplantation techniques utilize the patient&#x27;s existing hair. The aim of the surgical procedure is to use such hair as efficiently as possible. The right candidates for this type of surgery are individuals who still have healthy hair on the sides and the back of the head in order that hair for the transplant may be harvested from those areas. Different techniques are utilized in order to obtain the desired cosmetic results; factors considered may include hair color, texture, curliness, etc.

The most utilized technique is the one known as micro grafting because it produces naturalistic results. It is akin to follicular unit extraction, although less advanced. A knife with multiple blades is used to remove tissue from donor areas. The removed tissue is then fragmented into smaller chunks under direct vision inspection (i.e., without a microscope).

===Disease===
The scalp is a common site for the development of tumours including:
* Actinic keratosis
* Basal-cell carcinoma
* Epidermoid cyst
* Merkel-cell carcinoma
* Pilar cyst
* Squamous cell carcinoma

===Scalp conditions===
* Dandruff – a common problem caused by excessive shedding of dead skin cells from the scalp
* Head lice infestation
* Excoriation disorder – obsessive skin picking
* Trichotillomania – obsessive hair pulling
* Seborrhoeic dermatitis – a skin disorder causing scaly, flaky, itchy, red skin
* Cradle cap – a form of seborrhoeic dermatitis which occurs in newborns
* Trichodynia – burning scalp syndrome
* Tinea capitis - ringworm of the scalp, and its severe form Favus
* Cutis verticis gyrata – a rare deformity of the scalp

==Society and culture==
The scalp plays an important role in the aesthetics of the face. Androgenic alopecia, or male pattern hair loss, is a common cause of concern to men. It may be treated with varying rates success by medication (e.g. finasteride, minoxidil) or hair transplantation. If the scalp is heavy and loose, a common change with ageing, the forehead may be low, heavy and deeply lined. The brow lift procedure aims to address these concerns.

Scalping is the act of removing a human scalp, usually with hair, as a trophy. Often associated with the history of North America, scalping developed independently on multiple continents and dates back to antiquity.

<text>The Istvaeones were a Germanic group of tribes living near the banks of the Rhine during the Roman Empire which reportedly shared a common culture and origin. The Istaevones were contrasted to neighbouring groups, the Ingaevones on the North Sea coast, and the Herminones, living inland of these groups.

In linguistics, the term &quot;Istvaeonic languages&quot; is also sometimes used in discussions about the grouping of the northwestern West Germanic languages, consisting of Frankish and its descendants (principally Old Dutch) as well as several closely related historical dialects. Whether or not the Istvaeones spoke a Germanic language according to modern definitions, the theory proposes that their language indirectly influenced later Germanic languages in the area as a substrate.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;Istvaeonic&quot; is derived from a culturo-linguistic grouping of Germanic tribes mentioned by Tacitus, who used the spelling &quot;&quot;Istæuones&quot; in his &quot;Germania&quot;, and Pliny the Elder, who used the spelling &quot;Istuaeones&quot;&quot;. Pliny further specified its meaning by claiming that the Istvæones lived near the Rhine. Jacob Grimm in the book &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot; argued that Iscaevones was the correct form, partly because it would connect the name to an ancestor figure in Norse mythology named Ask and partly because in Pseudo-Nennius where the name Mannus is corrupted as Alanus, the ancestor of the Istaevones appears as Escio or Hisicion. Pseudo-Nennius derives his information from the Frankish Table of Nations (c. 520), which names the Franks, Romans, Bretons and Alamanni as descendants of Istio, one of the three sons of Mannus. (Other spellings of this name that appear in the manuscripts include Estio, Escio, Hostius, Ostius, Hisisio, Hissitio, Hisitio, Hessitio and Scius.)

Tacitus (56 – ~120 AD): 
:The Germanic tribes themselves I should regard as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. (...) In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past, they celebrate an earth-born god, Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ingævones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Istævones.

Pliny the Elder (23 – 79 AD): 
:There are five German races; the Vandili, parts of whom are the Burgundiones, the Varini, the Carini, and the Gutones: the Ingævones, forming a second race, a portion of whom are the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the Chauci. The Istævones, who join up to the Rhine [proximi autem rheno istuaeones], and to whom the Cimbri belong [sic.], are the third race; while the Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the Hermunduri, the Chatti, and the Cherusci: the fifth race is that of the Peucini, who are also the Basternæ, adjoining the Dacians previously mentioned.

The Istvaeones (Pliny) or Istaevones (Tacitus) are therefore one of the least clearly defined of these groups, but Pliny and Tacitus and other classical sources clearly associated various tribes with the Rhine frontier region, and the description of Pliny also explains that the Chatti, Cherusci and Chauci are not included in the group. In this period, between them and the Rhine, Tacitus also specifically named various tribes such as the Chamavi, Bructeri, Sugambri, Ubii and others. Also by implication the definitions above include all of the Romanized Germani Cisrhenani on the Roman side of the Rhine, because Tacitus (and before him by Julius Caesar) agreed that these peoples were related to the Germanic tribes on the other side of the Rhine. Tacitus mentions that in his time they called themselves the Tungri. He also mentions that some Rhine tribes by his time, such as the Batavi, and Cananefates, were in fact recent immigrants, and relatives of the Chatti. Throughout the Roman era, starting already in the time of Caesar, more eastern Germanic tribes pressed the Rhine area, most famously the Chauci, Saxons and Suevians, pushing tribes into the area such as the Usipetes, Tencteri and Ampsivarii. Despite the pressures from two directions, the Chamavi and Bructeri survived in the same area until late Roman times, along with various tribes who may have been there in the time of Tacitus, or may have immigrated, such as the Salii and Chattuari (whose name suggests a connection to the Chatti).

The historical sources give no complete account of the Istvaeones. Modern historians attempt to extrapolate their tribal constituents based on later sources, archeological findings and linguistic information.

==Istvaeones as possible ancestors to the Franks==

There is an overlap between Germanic tribes generally assumed to have been Istvaeonic in terms of dialect and culture, and the tribes who came later to be thought of collectively as the earliest &quot;Franks&quot;. Edward James speculated that the Chamavi may have been the first such tribe, around which neighbours came also to be called by this name:

:A Roman marching-song joyfully recorded in a fourth-century source, is associated with the 260s; but the Franks&#x27; first appearance in a contemporary source was in 289. [...] The Chamavi were mentioned as a Frankish people as early as 289, the Bructeri from 307, the Chattuarri from 306-15, the Salii or Salians from 357, and the Amsivarii and Tubantes from c. 364-75.

The large &quot;Irmionic&quot; nation of the Chatti also seem to have been considered Franks, or allies of the Franks, at least once. In one of the last mentions of them as a separate people, Sulpicius Alexander, cited by Gregory of Tours mentions them as being led along with the Ampsivarii by the Frankish king Marcomer.

Other Franks, sometimes called Salii, moved into Roman territory from north of the Rhine and were settled at the delta island of Batavia, and then Toxandria. In the 5th century, in the time of Flavius Aëtius they conquered as far as Tournai, despite Roman opposition, and later worked with the Romans against Attila the Hun. Further up the Rhine, the Franks eventually had a kingdom centred upon the Roman city of Cologne, on the left bank of the Rhine. The Chattuari also apparently crossed the Rhine and held lands on both sides. A separate Chamavi population possibly still existed as late as the 8th century, when it has been proposed that a separate legal code was published under Charlemagne, the &quot;Lex Chamavorum&quot;.

During the late 5th century, the Frankish frontier tribes and the Roman territories of Northern Gaul came to be politically united under a Frankish military leader of northern Roman Gaul, King Clovis I, and his Merovingian dynasty. He published the Lex Salica, a legal code applicable to the Roman region south of the original Frankish territories, from the Loire in modern France to the Silva Carbonaria in modern Belgium. It grew to rule large parts of the former Western Roman Empire and Germania.

At some point in the above sequence, the ethnonyms &quot;Frank&quot; and &quot;Frankish&quot; morphed into a term closer in meaning to a proto-state or political identity, rather than a tribal or ethnic designation and can no longer be considered synonymous with the Istvaeones. However from the Merovingian period it is clear, as for example reported by Gregory of Tours, that there was a &quot;Frankish language&quot; distinct from the Romance languages which continued to be spoken by much of the population in what would become France.

== The Istvaeones as a linguistic grouping ==

The German linguist Friedrich Maurer (1898–1984), in his book &quot;Nordgermanen und Alemannen&quot;, used the term Istvaeones to refer to a unattested proto-language, or dialectal grouping, ancestral to Old Frankish, Old Dutch and, at the very least, influenced several dialects of West Central German.

== The Istvaeones as an archeological culture ==

Finds assigned to the Istvaeones are characterized by a greater heterogeneity than can be found in the other Germanic archaeological groupings. Their predominant burial type is the pyre grave. There are no richly equipped princely graves or weapons as grave goods to be found as, for example, occur with the neighboring Elbe Germanic groups. Scholars have speculated about whether weapons were used as &quot;immaterial&quot; grave goods instead. In other words, weapons made of metal were placed on the pyre of a warrior, for example, but only his ashes were buried in the pyre grave. This is, however, a controversial thesis. Weapons as grave goods first appear in northern Gaul, i.e. on the Roman side of the Rhine, in burial graves, and are not found to the east of the Rhine until the Merovingian period.

== Key Concepts ==

=== Emotional Literacy ===
Sawaf claims to have coined the term, &#x27;Emotional Literacy&#x27; in 1997 &quot;Emotional Literacy is the ability to recognize, understand and appropriately express our emotions. It is the first step towards building our Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and the cornerstone of Emotional and Social Learning (SEL),&quot; as published in The Emotional Literacy Series. 

=== Emotional Intelligence ===
&quot;Emotional Intelligence is the ability to sense, understand, and effectively apply the power and acumen of emotions as a source of human energy, information, connection and influence,&quot; as published in by Robert Cooper &amp; Ayman Sawaf.In 1996, Sawaf and Robert Cooper published the book, &quot;&quot;Executive EQ: Emotional Intelligence in Leadership and Organizations&quot;. They claim that it is the first book to introduce Emotional Intelligence to the business world. &quot;Executive EQ&quot; is published in 17 languages across 28 countries. In collaboration with Essi Systems, a consulting company, Cooper and Sawaf included an EQ Map in the book.

Ayman Sawaf has also contributed to other books on Emotional Intelligence, including
* &quot;The Modern Day Alchemist from the Land of the Pharaohs&quot;,&quot;
* &quot;Flip: Turn Your World Around&quot;
* &quot;Emotions at Work: Theory, Research and Applications for Management&quot; edited by Roy L. Payne &amp; Cary L. Cooper.

=== Sacred Commerce ===
Sawaf&#x27;s book, &quot;Sacred Commerce: A Blueprint for a new Humanity,&quot; explores the history commerce through the stories of the Merchant Priesthood in Ancient Egypt.

The book also introduces the concept of the Fourth Bottom Line (Purpose), what Sawaf calls a new map for self-realization through business and sourced in Emotional Alchemy, Resonance Causation, and the &quot;Forgotten Ingredient of Leadership&quot;

<text>This is a list of rivers in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]].

List of West Virginia rivers includes streams formally designated as rivers. There are also smaller streams (i.e., branches, creeks, drains, forks, licks, runs, etc.) in the state. Exclusive of major tributaries, there are about 46 named rivers in West Virginia. Though relatively few in number, rivers have traditionally provided easy avenues of transportation through the rough terrain of the Mountain State, first by Native Americans and later by European settlers. Even today, the larger rivers transport large volumes of commercial goods, while the smaller ones provide recreational opportunities such as canoeing, fishing, swimming, and white-water rafting.

<text>East Cowes is a town and civil parish in the north of the Isle of Wight, on the east bank of the River Medina, next to its west bank neighbour Cowes. It has a population of 8,428 according to the 2021 Census.

The two towns are connected by the Cowes Floating Bridge, a chain ferry operated by the Isle of Wight Council.

East Cowes is the site of Norris Castle, and Osborne House, the former summer residence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince had a major influence on the architecture of the area, for example on the building of St Mildred&#x27;s Church in nearby Whippingham, which features distinctive turrets imitating those found on a German castle.

==History==


The name &quot;Estcowe&quot; (East Cowes) originally comes from one of two sandbanks each side of the River Medina estuary, so-called after a supposed likeness to cows. The name was subsequently transferred to fortifications built during the reign of Henry VIII on the east bank (East Cowes Castle) to dispel a French invasion, referred to as cowforts or cowes, which subsequently gave the name to the town. The naming of Cowes was done in a similar fashion. They replaced the earlier name of Shamblord.

The settlement of Shamblord at East Cowes was first recorded in 1303. It grew as East Shamblord, and became a much more significant settlement than the Western Shamblord. As the Isle of Wight was the target of frequent French invasions, with some notable incursions, the fort built at East Cowes was later destroyed and should not be confused with the &quot;East Cowes Castle&quot; built subsequently by John Nash.

During the reign of Queen Victoria, who made her summer home at Osborne by acquiring and rebuilding Osborne House, East Cowes was the subject of planned estate of grand houses, groves and parks. The scheme, not finding the finances it needed, folded, but a few residences built in the early stages still survive to this day such as the former Albert Grove residences of Kent House and Powys House on York Avenue.

In East Cowes Norris Castle was designed in the Norman style by James Wyatt in the late eighteenth century. The building survives and today remains a private home. In 1798, the architect John Nash, began building his home, East Cowes Castle, where he later entertained the Prince Consort and other prominent guests. East Cowes Castle was notable for its Gothic towers and turrets, and elaborate castellation. Nash died in 1835 and is buried in the tower of St James&#x27; Church which he also designed. East Cowes Castle was severely damaged by bombing in World War II. It was demolished during the 1960s, although the ice house remains and is visible in Sylvan Avenue. East Cowes Urban District Council, which had been based at East Cowes Town Hall, was absorbed into Cowes Urban District Council in 1933.

During World War II, both Cowes and East Cowes became the targets of frequent bombing due to its industry and proximity to Southampton and the Royal Navy&#x27;s home at Portsmouth. The shipyard of J. Samuel White was badly damaged by air attack in early May 1942 but, when rebuilt, innovative ship construction methods had been introduced. The first warship completed by the renewed yard was HMS &quot;Cavalier&quot;. During the air raid, the local defences had been fortuitously augmented by the Polish destroyer &quot;Blyskawica&quot; (itself built by White&#x27;s), which put up such a determined defence that, in 2002, the crew&#x27;s courage was honoured by a local commemoration lasting several days to mark the 60th anniversary of the event. Later in 2004, and over to the west, an area of Cowes was named Francki Place in honour of the ship&#x27;s commander.

To celebrate the Silver Jubilee of the Queen&#x27;s coronation in 1977, the main hangar doors of what was then the British Hovercraft Corporation (a successor to Saunders Roe) were painted with the world&#x27;s largest image of the Union Jack, which can still be seen today.

In January 2015, the car carrier bound for Bremerhaven, Germany, ran aground on Bramble Bank after developing a heavy list, roughly north of the entrance to the River Medina. It has since been re-floated, repaired, and returned to service.

==Transport==
East Cowes is linked to the mainland by Red Funnel&#x27;s vehicle ferry service. The Cowes Floating Bridge links East Cowes with Cowes throughout the day. It is a chain ferry, and is one of the few remaining not to be replaced by a physical bridge.

Southern Vectis operate bus route 4 linking the town with Ryde and bus routes route 5 and 25 linking the town with Newport including intermediate villages.

The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs through East Cowes.

==Industry==
Local industry in both Cowes and East Cowes has always centred on the building and design of marine craft and materials associated with boatmaking, including the early flying boats, and sailmaking.

East Cowes was also once home to the aircraft manufacturer Saunders Roe, who built the large, advanced, flying boat The Saunders-Roe Princess, as well as the Black Knight rocket and the Black Arrow satellite carrier rocket. They also developed and tested the first hovercraft, the SR.N1.

The former Saunders-Roe factory at Venture Quays now produces wind turbines, which can be seen laid on the quay for shipping out. Due to local objections no wind turbines have been allowed to be erected on the Isle of Wight.

==Sport and leisure==
East Cowes has a Non-League football club East Cowes Victoria Athletic A.F.C., which plays at Beatrice Avenue. They are also home to FC Bayern Bru who play in the islands Leisure Leagues 6-a-side league at Beatrice Avenue. They won the league title in their inaugural season in the winter of 2013.

==Notable residents==
* Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
* Princess Henry of Battenberg, later known as Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, who resided at Osborne Cottage
*Seb Clover (born 1987), set the world record in 2003 as the youngest cross-Atlantic solo yachtsman, and lived in East Cowes
*Sir Christopher Cockerell, inventor of the hovercraft, lived at White Cottage
*Roscow George Shedden, colonial bishop of Nassau
*John Nash, architect
*John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort, World War II field marshal and commander of the British Expeditionary Force
*Lord Mountbatten of Burma (in childhood), later last viceroy of India at Kent House, East Cowes

==Redevelopment project==
The East Cowes Redevelopment Project was set up by SEEDA https://www.iow.gov.uk/azservices/documents/2780-41-08%20Appendix%20A.pdf for the flagship project for the Cowes Waterfront Initiate, which includes redeveloping the town centre of East Cowes. It was intended that such changes would create better employment opportunities and a better environment for residents and visitors alike, providing a unique opportunity to improve East Cowes and create better investment for businesses.

On 6 April 2010, work started on the new Waitrose store on Well Road on the old site of the hovercraft development building. Recruitment for jobs for the new Waitrose Store started during August/September 2010; there were 160 jobs available throughout the store and over 800 people applied.

Part of the redevelopment also included the building of more houses known as &quot;Victoria Walk&quot; and David Wilson was chosen to be the builder. Advertising boards were placed on Old Road in East Cowes with building work commencing soon after.

In 2013, work began to create a new 300 berth marina inside a new breakwater. The plan included a new hotel, restaurant and 100 homes.

During August 2012, a new medical centre opened at Church Path, near Waitrose. The former medical centre at Down House (the former home of respected local GP Dr Down), on York Avenue, was closed.

==Library==
During December 2010, under a cost-cutting plan by the Isle of Wight Council it was decided most local libraries across the Island would close in March 2011, with just Newport and Ryde remaining open. Sandown, Cowes, Ventnor &amp; Freshwater remained open until March 2012, during which time community groups were sought to continue the upkeep and running of the libraries.

East Cowes was one of the libraries set to close in March 2011, but was saved by East Cowes Town Council who appealed for volunteers to continue running the library. It remains at the town centre premises near to the Co-op supermarket, with an outlook to move to newer premises in the near future. Whilst under the Isle of Wight Council ownership it opened around 30 hours a week; this was reduced to around 12 hours per week.

<doc id="555260" wikidata="Q1653331" url="?curid=555260" title="Battle of the Yser">
<text>The Battle of the Yser (, ) was a battle of the First World War that took place in October 1914 between the towns of Nieuwpoort and Diksmuide, along a stretch of the Yser River and the Yperlee Canal, in Belgium. The front line was held by a large Belgian force, which halted the German advance in a costly defensive battle.

The victory at the Yser allowed Belgium to retain a small strip of territory, with Germany in control of 95 per cent of Belgian territory, which made King Albert a Belgian national hero, sustained national pride and provided a venue for commemorations of heroic sacrifice for the next hundred years.

==Background==

===German invasion of Belgium===
On 2 August 1914, the Belgian government refused passage through Belgium to German troops and on the night of the Belgian General Staff ordered the Third Division to Liège to obstruct a German advance. The German army invaded Belgium on the morning of 4 August. Covered by the Third Division, the Liège fortress garrison, a screen of the Cavalry Division and detachments from Liège and Namur, the Belgian field army closed up to the river Gete and by 4 August, the First Division had assembled at Tienen, the Fifth Division at Perwez, the Second Division at Leuven and the Sixth Division at Wavre, covering central and western Belgium and communications towards Antwerp. German cavalry appeared at Visé early on 4 August, to find the bridge down and Belgian troops on the west bank; the Germans crossed at a ford and forced the Belgians to retire towards Liège. By evening, it was clear to the Belgian High Command that the Third Division and the Liège garrison were in the path of a very large invasion force.

With information that five German corps and six reserve corps were in Belgium and with no immediate support available from the French army and British Expeditionary Force (BEF), the Belgian field army was ordered to withdraw towards the National Redoubt on the evening of 18 August and arrived on 20 August. At an engagement between the First Division and the German IX Corps near Tienen, the Belgians suffered The Belgian government of Charles de Broqueville left Brussels for Antwerp and the Belgian capital was occupied unopposed on 20 August, as the Belgian field army completed its retreat to Antwerp. The German Siege of Namur ended with a Belgian capitulation on 24 August, as the field army made a sortie from Antwerp towards Brussels. The Germans detached the III Reserve Corps from the 1st Army to mask the city and a division of the IV Reserve Corps to occupy Brussels.
On 1 October, General Hans Hartwig von Beseler ordered an attack on the Antwerp forts Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Walem and the Bosbeek and Dorpveld redoubts by the 5th Reserve and Marine divisions. By Fort Walem was severely damaged, Fort Lier had been hit by a shell, Fort Koningshooikt and the Tallabert and Bosbeek redoubts were mostly intact and the intervening ground between Fort Sint-Katelijne-Waver and Dorpveld redoubt had been captured. A counter-attack failed and the Fourth Division was reduced to The Belgian commanders ordered the left flank of the army to withdraw to a line north of the Nete, which covered the gap in the outer defences and kept the city out of range of German super-heavy artillery. Proclamations warning the inhabitants that King Albert I and the government would leave Antwerp were put up during the day. Early on 9 October, German troops found some forts of the inner ring empty; Beseler ended the bombardment and summoned the military governor, General Victor Deguise, to surrender. About 30,000 men of the Antwerp garrison surrendered and the city was occupied by German troops. About of the garrison ( of the Belgian Army) fled north to the Netherlands, where they were interned for the duration.

During the siege of Antwerp, the German and French armies fought the Battle of the Frontiers and then the German armies in the north pursued the French and the BEF southwards into France in the Great Retreat, which culminated in the First Battle of the Marne followed by the First Battle of the Aisne Reciprocal attempts by the Franco-British and German armies to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army, the Race to the Sea took place through Picardy, Artois and Flanders The &quot;race&quot; ended on the North Sea coast of Belgium, when the last open area from Diksmuide to the North Sea was occupied by Belgian troops from Antwerp.

===Allied retreat to the Yser===
British and French forces in Belgium covered the withdrawal of the Belgians and British from Antwerp. The First, Third and Fourth divisions reached Ostend, the Fifth and Sixth divisions arrived at Torhout and Diksmuide and the Antwerp garrison troops moved to an area north-west of Ghent. The Germans 4th &quot;Ersatz&quot; Division and troops at Lokeren and Moerbeke turned east towards Ghent before the withdrawal was discovered. The III Reserve Corps and the 4th Division were then ordered to turn west and advance on Kortrijk, to prolong the main German front, before being sent towards Ghent and Bruges, with orders to reach Blankenberge and Ostend on the coast. On 11 October, German troops were detected advancing on Ghent, by which time the Belgian fortress troops had joined the field army. A retreat from Ghent from began, after which German troops entered the city. Several bridges were demolished during the retirement, although crowds of civilians on the main road and rail bridges led to them being left intact.
By 18 October, the Belgian, British and French troops in northern France and Belgium had formed a defensive line, the British II Corps assembled with the 5th Division from La Bassée Canal north to Beau Puits, the 3rd Division from Illies to Aubers and three divisions of the French Cavalry Corps (General Louis Conneau) deployed from Fromelles to Le Maisnil. The British III Corps had the 6th Division from Radinghem to Epinette and the 4th Division from Epinette to Pont Rouge, the BEF Cavalry Corps with the 1st and 2nd Cavalry divisions, from Deûlémont to Tenbrielen. The British IV Corps with the 7th Division and 3rd Cavalry Division from Zandvoorde to Oostnieuwkerke; the French and the de Mitry Cavalry Corps covered the ground from Roeselare (Roulers) to Kortemark (Cortemarck), the 87th and 89th Territorial divisions from Passendale (Passchendaele) to Boezinge (Boesinghe) and then the Belgian field army and fortress troops from Boezinge to Nieuwpoort. The Brigade de Fusiliers Marins (Rear-Admiral Pierre Alexis Ronarc&#x27;h) with six battalions, mostly reservists, with 6,670 men of whom 1,450 were fusiliers, a machine-gun company (16 guns) and four machine-guns in each battalion. were sent from Pierrefitte, near Paris to Flanders on 7 October and by 18 October were at Diksmuide (Dixmude).

=== Flanders terrain ===

Part of northern France and north Belgium from the Pas-de-Calais to the Scheldt estuary had been known as Flanders since the eleventh century. West of a line between Arras and Calais in the north of France lie chalk downlands covered with soil sufficient for arable farming, and east of the line the land declines in a series of spurs into the Flanders plain. By 1914, the plain was bounded by canals linking Douai, Béthune, Saint-Omer and Calais. To the south-east, canals run between Lens, Lille, Roubaix and Kortrijk, the Lys river from Kortrijk to Ghent and to the north-west lies the sea. The plain is almost flat, apart from a line of low hills from Cassel, east to Mont des Cats (Katsberg), Zwarteberg (Mont Noir), Rodeberg (Mont Rouge), Scherpenberg and Kemmelberg (Mount Kemmel). From Kemmel, a low ridge lies to the north-east, declining in elevation past Ypres through Wijtschate (Wytschaete), Geluveld (Gheluvelt) and Passendale (Passchendaele), curving north then north-west to Diksmuide where it merges with the plain. A coastal strip about wide is near sea level and fringed by sand dunes. Inland the ground is mainly meadow, cut by canals, dykes, drainage ditches and roads built up on causeways. The Lys, Yser and the upper Scheldt have been canalised and between them the water level underground is close to the surface, rises further in the autumn and fills any dip, the sides of which then collapse. The ground surface quickly turns to a consistency of cream cheese and on the coast troop movements were confined to roads, except during frosts.

The rest of the Flanders Plain is woods and small fields, divided by hedgerows planted with trees and cultivated from small villages and farms. The terrain was difficult for infantry operations because of the lack of observation, impossible for mounted action because of the many obstructions and difficult for artillery because of the limited view. South of La Bassée Canal around Lens and Béthune was a coal-mining district full of slag heaps, pit heads () and miners&#x27; houses (). North of the canal, the cities of Lille, Tourcoing and Roubaix form a manufacturing complex, with outlying industries at Armentières, Comines, Halluin and Menen, along the Lys river, with isolated sugar beet and alcohol refineries and a steel works near Aire-sur-la-Lys. Intervening areas are agricultural, with wide roads on shallow foundations, unpaved mud tracks in France and narrow pavé roads along the frontier and in Belgium. In France, the roads were closed by the local authorities during thaws to preserve the surface and marked by , which in 1914 were ignored by British lorry drivers. The difficulty of movement after the end of summer absorbed much of the civilian labour available on road maintenance, leaving field defences to be built by front-line soldiers.

==Prelude==
The Belgian retreat continued on covered by cavalry, cyclists and motor machine-gun sections. On 14 October, the Belgian army began to dig in along the Yser, the Sixth and Fifth divisions to the north of French territorial divisions, assembled at Boezinge (Boesinghe), then northwards along the Yser canal to the at Diksmuide (Dixmude). The Fourth, First and Second divisions prolonged the line north, with advanced posts at Beerst, Keiem (Keyem), Schoore and Mannekensvere, about forward on the east bank. A bridgehead was also held near the coast around Lombartzyde and Westende, to cover Nieuwpoort (Nieuport), with the 2nd Cavalry Division in reserve. On 18 October, the French 87th and 89th Territorial divisions took over the defence of the front line south of Fort Knokke from the Sixth Division, which was moved to the Yser Front. On 21 October, the hard-pressed Belgian Army was reinforced by the French 42nd Division (Major-General Paul François Grossetti).

The Allies assembled a naval force under the British Admiral Horace Hood with three monitors, , , and assorted craft to provide heavy artillery support to the defenders of the seaward flank. The German forces comprised the new 4th Army (Albrecht Duke of Württemberg), with the III Reserve Corps from Antwerp and four new reserve corps from Germany, along with cavalry and heavy artillery units. It moved southwards from Bruges and Ostend in the direction of the Yser river, to take the line from Nieuwpoort to Ypres (Ieper).

==Battle==
On 16 October Diksmuide, garrisoned by Belgian and French troops (Colonel Alphonse Jacques), was attacked. Despite many casualties, the Belgians and French held the town. The press, politicians, literary figures and the military manipulated public opinion, making out that the defence of the town was strategically-important and heroic.
On 18 October, the German offensive began and overran Allied troops from Nieuwpoort southwards to Arras. The objective was to defeat the Belgian and French armies and to deprive the British of access to Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk. The III Reserve Corps attacked Belgian defences from Diksmuide to the sea, regardless of loss. The Germans captured advanced posts at Keiem, Schoore and part of Mannekensvere and reached the Yser, despite bombardments from the Anglo-French flotilla, which engaged German troops along the coast as far as Middelkerke. The 4th Ersatz Division was forbidden to cross the Yser at Nieuwpoort because of the shell-fire from the Allied ships.

On 21 October, the Germans established a small bridgehead on the west bank, despite a counter-attack by the French 42nd Division, which had just arrived and the last bridge was blown on 23 October. Diksmuide was constantly bombarded and attacked but the defenders managed to hold on. , the French high command, planned to flood the land to obstruct the Germans, which would trap the Belgian army between the flood and the Germans or force them to abandon the last part of unoccupied Belgium. The plan was postponed because the Belgian army was preparing to flood the area between the Yser and its tributary canals.

On 25 October, the German pressure on the Belgians was so great that a decision was taken to inundate the Belgian front line. After an abortive attempt on 21 October, the Belgians managed to open the sluices at Nieuwpoort during the nights from 26 to 30 October, during high tides, steadily raising the water level until an impassable flooded area was created of about wide, stretching as far south as Diksmuide.

The Germans attacked again on the Yser front on 30 October, overran the Belgian second line and reached Ramskapelle and Pervijze. Belgian and French counter-attacks recovered Ramskapelle and the final attack, planned for the next day was called off when the Germans realised that the land behind them was flooding. The Germans withdrew in the night of 30/31 October. On 10 November, Diksmuide fell and the fighting continued further south until 22 November, in the First Battle of Ypres.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
The Belgian Army and its allies had managed to hold the last corner of Belgium, ending the Race to the Sea and the period of open warfare. The front line along the Yser River became known as the Yser Front and was held by the Belgian Army until 1918. The struggle of the Belgian army to hold on to its territory during the remainder of the war and the experiences of ordinary Flemish infantrymen, led to an increase in Flemish national sentiment and the foundation of the , the first party of the Flemish Movement, in 1917.

===Casualties===
The British official historian, James Edmonds, wrote in 1925, in the second 1914 volume of the &quot;History of the Great War&quot;, that from 18 October to 30 November 1914, between Gheluvelt and the coast, the Germans suffered an estimated 76,250 casualties. In 2010, Jack Sheldon wrote that from 18 to 30 October, the Belgian army suffered 20,000 casualties and that German casualties may have been much greater.

<text>Helen Suzman, OMSG, DBE (née Gavronsky; 7 November 1917 – 1 January 2009) was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician. She represented a series of liberal and centre-left opposition parties during her 36-year tenure in the whites-only, National Party-controlled House of Assembly of South Africa at the height of apartheid.

She hosted the meeting that founded the Progressive Party in 1959, and was its only MP in the 160-member House for thirteen years. She was the only member of the South African Parliament to consistently and unequivocally oppose all apartheid legislation.

Suzman was instrumental in improving prison conditions for members of the banned African National Congress including Nelson Mandela, despite her reservations about Mandela&#x27;s revolutionary policies, and was also known for using her parliamentary privilege to evade government censorship and pass information to the media about the worst abuses of apartheid. She was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Early life and education==

Suzman was born Helen Gavronsky in 1917 to Frieda and Samuel Gavronsky, Jewish Lithuanian immigrants. She was born in Germiston, then a small mining town outside Johannesburg. Her mother died shortly after she was born.

Suzman matriculated in 1933 from Parktown Convent, Johannesburg. She studied for a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce at Witwatersrand University. At age 19, she married Dr. Moses Suzman (who died in 1994), who was 33, and an eminent physician; the couple had two daughters, one of whom became a physician. Helen Suzman returned to university in 1941 to complete a degree in economics and economic history. After completing her degree she spent the rest of the war working for the Governor-General&#x27;s War Fund and as a statistician at the War Supply board. In 1945, she became a tutor and later lecturer in economic history at Witwatersrand University.

==Career==

===Career before Parliament===

As a member of the South African Institute of Race Relations, she was involved in preparing evidence for the Fagan Commission&#x27;s inquiry into laws applying to Africans in urban areas and into the system of migrant labour. She attributed this experience to her first real awareness of the hardship and difficulties experienced by Africans seeking work in urban areas.

===Parliamentary career===

Suzman has been described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as having had &quot;among the most courageous Parliamentary careers ever&quot;.

She was elected to the House of Assembly in 1953 as a member of the United Party for the Houghton constituency in Johannesburg.

The United Party caucus supported the second reading of the 1953 Separate Amenities Bill that provided for separate (and effectively unequal) facilities for Blacks, Coloureds, Indians and Whites. When the vote was taken, Helen Suzman and one other UP member refused to vote and walked out of the House.

Dissatisfied with the supine stance of the United Party to the apartheid policies of the Government, Suzman and eleven other liberal members of the United Party broke away to form the Progressive Party in 1959. The party rejected race discrimination and advocated equal opportunities for all with a qualified franchise with a common voter&#x27;s roll.

In the 1961 South African general election, all the other Progressive MPs lost their seats, while Suzman retained hers by a margin of just 564 votes. This left Suzman as the sole parliamentarian unequivocally opposed to apartheid for 13 years from 1961 to 1974.

===The solo years: 1961–1974===

After the 1961 election, Prime Minister Hendrik F. Verwoerd announced in Parliament that he had never believed the Progressive Party would be a threat and, turning towards Suzman, said &quot;I have written you off&quot;. Suzman replied &quot;And the whole world has written you off&quot;.

As the sole representative of her party in Parliament, she sought to do the work of an entire opposition party by herself. In her first session she made 66 speeches, moved 26 amendments and put 137 questions. Most of her questions concerned treatment of Black, Coloured and Indian people – on issues such as housing, education, forced removals, Pass Law offences, detentions, bannings, whippings, police brutality and execution.

Mandela later wrote: &quot;She was undoubtedly the only real anti-apartheid voice in parliament and the discourtesy of the Nat MPs towards her showed how they felt her punches and how deeply they resented her presence.&quot;

For two more general elections (1966 and 1970), she was again the sole member returned for her party to Parliament. As a result, for 13 years, she dined alone in Parliament with no other MP to discuss tactics or approach. Often, as apartheid legislation was introduced, she would call a division of the house, a process whereby the members of the Parliament had physically to stand up and be counted. On many such occasions, as when opposing the infamous 90-day detention law, she found herself alone at one side of the Parliamentary chamber and all other MPs at the other side.

An eloquent public speaker with a sharp and witty manner, Suzman was noted for her strong public criticism of the governing National Party&#x27;s policies of apartheid at a time when this was atypical of white South Africans. She found herself even more of an outsider because she was an English-speaking Jewish woman in a parliament dominated by Calvinist Afrikaner men. In her 13 years as the sole member of her party in the South African Parliament, Suzman made 885 speeches on almost every conceivable subject and posed 2,262 questions. In a period in which there were numerous laws passed imposing censorship on the press, parliamentary privilege ensured that her exchanges in Parliament could be published. She was once accused by a minister of asking questions in parliament that embarrassed South Africa, to which she replied: &quot;It is not my questions that embarrass South Africa; it is your answers.&quot;

On one occasion, Prime Minister Verwoerd announced in Parliament to her: &#x27;You are of no account. Your days in Parliament are numbered.&#x27; Suzman replied: &#x27;Why? Are you going to put me under house arrest or put me on Robben Island?&#x27;

Suzman was resolute in her opposition to all forms of racial discrimination. Early in her career, a white woman said at a caucus meeting, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t know about Mrs Suzman, but when I go to a museum, I don&#x27;t like it if some strange black man rubs himself up against me&quot;. Suzman retorted: &quot;Don&#x27;t you mind it if some strange white man rubs himself up against you?&quot; Later in her career, she mused in Parliament: &quot;I do not know why we equate—and with such examples before us—a white skin with civilisation&quot;.

=== Abuse and Suzman&#x27;s responses ===

Suzman was subject to antisemitic and misogynist abuse by Nationalist MPs in Parliament and out. Frequent comments were made to her in Parliament such as &quot;We don&#x27;t like your screeching Jewish voice&quot; or &quot;Go back to Israel!&quot; One Nationalist MP, Piet Koornhof, said to her in Parliament: &quot;If I should come home one evening and my wife should rant and rave the way the hon. member for Houghton did this afternoon, there would be only one of two things that one could do to her... I think she deserves a good hiding&quot;. In May 1965 P. W. Botha (then Minister of Coloured Affairs) remarked: ‘The Honourable Member for Houghton... is in the habit of chattering continually. If my wife chattered like that Honourable Member, I would know what to do with her. There is nothing that works on my nerves more than a woman who continually interrupts me. She is like water dripping on a tin roof.’ In 1986, she had the following exchange with the then State President Botha: &quot;Helen Suzman: Stupid! P. W. Botha: Woman!&quot;

When Prime Minister Verwoerd was assassinated in the Parliamentary chamber in 1966, P. W. Botha, then Minister of Defence, had accused Suzman of being responsible, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s you! You liberals did this! Now we&#x27;ll get you!&quot; She demanded, and eventually received a formal apology, but the enmity between the two remained. In the early 1980s, she had stayed to observe police dismantle shacks in a black settlement and take the occupants to jail. P. W. Botha warned in Parliament that her conduct was bordering on illegal and said &quot;I am telling you that if you try to break the law you will see what happens&quot;. Suzman responded: &quot;the prime minister has been trying to bully me for twenty-eight years and he has not succeeded yet. I am not frightened of you. I never have been and I never will be. I think nothing of you.&quot; On one occasion, P. W. Botha said &quot;The Hon. Member for Houghton, it is well known, does not like me&quot;. Suzman interjected: ‘Like you? I can’t stand you!’

She was often harassed by the police and her phone was tapped by them. She listed her name in the phone book and often received phone calls with obscene, racist and threatening messages. She had a special technique for dealing with such calls, which was to blow a shrill whistle into the mouthpiece of the phone.

Marie van Zyl, of the Kappie Kommando (An ultra-conservative Afrikaner women&#x27;s political organization), wrote to Suzman protesting the latter&#x27;s support for &quot;heathens&quot; and boasting that her own people, the Voortrekkers, had brought the Bible over the mountains to the interior to the blacks. She asked what Suzman&#x27;s people had done. Suzman replied: “You say your people brought the Bible over the mountains and ask what mine did. They wrote it, my dear …”

In February 1974, LJC Botha, Nationalist MP for Rustenburg remarked: ‘When she gets up in this House, she reminds me of a cricket in a thorn tree when it is very dry in the bushveld. His chirping makes you deaf but the tune remains the same year in and year out. In her fight for the Bantu, the honourable member... sings the same tune for year after year.’

She famously advised John Vorster, Prime Minister from 1966 to 1978, to some day visit a township, &quot;in heavy disguise as a human being&quot;. When a minister complained of the murder rate in his constituency, she advised him not to go there &quot;or it will rise by one&quot;.

=== Parliamentary career: 1974–1989 ===

Later, as parliamentary white opposition to apartheid grew, the Progressive Party gained a further 6 seats (in 1974) and Suzman was joined in parliament by notable liberal colleagues such as Colin Eglin. The party then merged in 1975 with Harry Schwarz&#x27;s Reform Party and became the Progressive Reform Party. It was renamed the Progressive Federal Party when further MPs from the reformist wing of the United Party joined in 1977 and the party became the official opposition.

She spent a total of 36 years in Parliament.

After the 1976 Soweto shootings, MP Dr HMJ van Rensburg said: &quot;It is a pity you were not one of them, Helen&quot; and another called her &quot;a saboteur of the police&quot;. Suzman herself said: &quot;Every Nationalist MP should go to at least one funeral for unrest victims heavily disguised as human beings, instead of sitting on their green benches in parliament, insulated like fish in an aquarium.&quot;

In 1982, following Neil Aggett&#x27;s death, she read out in Parliament a letter smuggled out of prison concerning Aggett&#x27;s torture at the hands of the security police.

In 1986, there was the following exchange in Parliament when Minister of Law and Order Le Grange asked &quot;Who is the hon Member for Houghton&#x27;s No 1 man in South Africa? It is Nelson Mandela&quot; Mrs Suzman responded: &quot;Let him go!&quot; Le Grange continued: &quot;She admires him with everything she has. He is the only man who according to her can counteract the present unrest situation in South Africa and negotiate on peace&quot;. Mrs Suzman interjected: &quot;That&#x27;s right!&quot;

=== Extra-parliamentary activity ===

Suzman&#x27;s motto was to &quot;go and see for yourself&quot;.

She was a frequent visitor to prisons to protect prisoners from warder brutality, and campaigned for improved prison conditions. She visited Nelson Mandela on numerous occasions while he was in prison and made representations to the authorities to improve his conditions and those of other prisoners on Robben Island. In his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela wrote: “It was an odd and wonderful sight to see this courageous woman peering into our cells and strolling around our courtyard. She was the first and only woman ever to grace our cells&quot;. Many of the prisoners, including Neville Alexander and Mandela himself, attributed improvements to their conditions, in part, to her visits: In his autobiography, Mandela attributes the removal of the sadistic warder Van Rensberg (aka &quot;Suitcase&quot;), who had a swastika tattooed on his hand, to Suzman&#x27;s visit and her subsequent representations to the authorities and in Parliament. Neville Alexander, too, attributed the transfer of Van Rensberg to another prison, to Suzman&#x27;s visit. Alexander noted that: &quot;Had Mrs Suzman not come in February 1967 there is no saying what might have happened&quot; According to Neville Alexander, it was &quot;important to note that, unofficially, the first Suzman visit is considered to be the turning point in the treatment of the political prisoners at Robben Island. This was certainly no mere coincidence...&quot; Andrew Mlangeni, a senior ANC member who was on Robben Island with Mandela, described how &quot;[w]henever our treatment in prison tended to improve a little bit, we knew that Suzman was on her way. We would get things such as books that you perhaps ordered more than six months ago. They would give you your books if you were studying, because those were some of the things we raised on Robben Island. You would have to wait for months before you could get books prescribed by the University of South Africa and other institutions, but as soon as you got them, you knew that Suzman was on her way to see the conditions under which we were living, to see how best she could help us.
Only a person such as Suzman could help us. The International Red Cross also used to visit us on Robben Island, but they couldn’t do as much as Suzman. Suzman was not afraid to go to Pretoria to the commissioner and raise these issues personally, to say that these were the conditions under which people were living, please bring about some improvement. She was a fearless lady.&quot;

She visited Robert Sobukwe when he was in virtual solitary confinement for 6 years and repeatedly sought his release in Parliament. During one debate in Parliament in which Suzman raised the conditions of Sobukwe&#x27;s imprisonment without trial in a compound in Robben Island, Nationalist MP GPC Bezuidenhout asked: “Why do you say that he is living in a compound? Is it not a flat?” Mrs Suzman answered: “I wonder whether the hon member who is so cynical about this would care to take up permanent residence in that flat. Perhaps he will enjoy it.”

She visited banned persons, such as Albert Luthuli, Winnie Mandela and Mamphela Ramphele, and made effective representations on their behalf. In 1963, Albert Luthuli, then President of the ANC, wrote to Helen Suzman and expressed his &quot;deep appreciation and admiration for your heroic and lone stand against a most reactionary Parliament...I most heartily congratulate you for your untiring efforts in a situation that would frustrate and benumb many... For ever remember, you are a bright Star in a dark Chamber...Not only ourselves – your contemporaries, but also posterity, will hold you in high esteem&quot;.

She visited Bram Fischer and other ANC and Communist Party political prisoners and personally provided them with speakers and records, seeking improvements to their conditions with ministers and in Parliament. She visited Fischer several times in hospital, calling repeatedly for his release and remarking in the press that with so many millions spent on security she did not understand why the government was so afraid of one incapacitated, bedridden old man. She was influential in his eventual release.

She attended the militant – and often dangerous – funerals of activists whenever invited to do so in the belief that her presence could prevent police brutality. She visited resettlement areas, townships and squatter camps, observing conditions and giving assistance to individuals where she could. She used these visits to arm herself with evidence from on the spot investigations &quot;to challenge forcefully the government and bear personal witness
to the suffering inflicted on millions of South Africans&quot;.

Suzman was inundated with requests for assistance from individuals harmed by the apartheid laws and bureaucracy. She regarded herself as the &quot;honorary ombudsman of the dispossessed&quot; and sought tirelessly to make representations on their behalf to the relevant authorities. Nadine Gordimer commented: &quot;[But over the years I have observed – that when people are in trouble, she has been the one they have appealed to. She is the one everyone trusted]…Suzman never refused anyone her help, that I knew of. No matter how unpleasant or hostile the individual&#x27;s attitude to her and her political convictions had been.&quot;

===Other issues===

Although principally concerned with issues of race discrimination, Suzman was also concerned with other issues including women&#x27;s rights. Her maiden speech was on the 1953 Matrimonial Affairs Bill. Women&#x27;s rights (and in particular those of Black women) became part of the larger fight for human rights. She campaigned against gender discrimination, particularly as it affected African women whose status in customary law was that of &quot;perpetual minors.&quot; In 1988 she was instrumental in having matrimonial legislation enacted that greatly improved the legal status of women. She fought for equal matrimonial property rights for Black women, divorce by consent and the reform of abortion laws.

She was opposed to capital punishment and campaigned against its reintroduction.

In 1971, she was the only member of Parliament who voted against what she described as &quot;the harshest drugs law in the world&quot; that laid down a mandatory 2-year sentence of imprisonment for possession of cannabis and a mandatory 5-year sentence of imprisonment for possession of more than 115g of cannabis. She supported the decriminalisation of marijuana use long before it was fashionable, stating publicly that possession of marijuana/cannabis (or dagga, as it is known in South Africa) for personal use should not be a criminal offence.

=== Post-parliamentary career: 1989–2009 ===

She was appointed by Mandela to the first electoral commission of South Africa that oversaw the first election based on universal franchise in 1994.
She was chairwoman of the Vaal Reef Disaster Fund for three years, appointed to look after the widows and children of the 104 men killed in the Vaal Reef mining disaster of 10 May 1995. She was president of the South African Institute of Race Relations, one of the premier research institutions in SA. She served as a member of the Human Rights Commission from 1995 to 1998.

She was present with Mandela when he signed the new constitution in 1996.

Speaking in 2004 at the age of 86, Suzman confessed that she was disappointed by the African National Congress. Suzman stated:

&quot;I had hoped for something much better... [t]he poor in this country have not benefited at all from the ANC. This government spends &#x27;like a drunken sailor&#x27;. Instead of investing in projects to give people jobs, they spend millions buying weapons and private jets, and sending gifts to Haiti.&quot;

Referring to South Africa&#x27;s relations with Zimbabwe, whose president Robert Mugabe had in 2001 declared Suzman an &quot;enemy of the state&quot;, she said: &quot;Mugabe has destroyed that country while South Africa has stood by and done nothing. The way Mugabe was feted at the inauguration last month was an embarrassing disgrace. But it served well to illustrate very clearly Mbeki&#x27;s point of view.&quot;

Suzman also stated her distrust of the racial politics of Mbeki:

&quot;Don&#x27;t think for a moment that Mbeki is not anti-white – he is, most definitely. His speeches all have anti-white themes and he continues to convince everyone that there are two types of South African – the poor black and the rich white.&quot;

Perhaps conscious that she might be misconstrued, Suzman added:

&quot;For all my criticisms of the current system, it doesn&#x27;t mean that I would like to return to the old one. I don&#x27;t think we will ever go the way of Zimbabwe, but people are entitled to be concerned. I am hopeful about any future for whites in this country – but not entirely optimistic.&quot;

==Recognition and legacy==

Working from within the system, she earned the respect of Nelson Mandela. He praised her courage and credited her with improving prison conditions. Outspoken and independent, Suzman spoke out against the regime but sometimes opposed Mandela&#x27;s policies. She was critical of Mandela when he praised dictator Muammar Gaddafi as a supporter of human rights.

Mandela wrote a message to Suzman on her 85th birthday, stating &quot;Your courage, integrity and principled commitment to justice have marked you as one of the outstanding figures in the history of public life in South Africa. On your 85th birthday we can but pay tribute to you, thank you and let you know how fortunate our country feels for having had you as part of its public life and politics.&quot; Mandela added: &quot;Now, looking back from the safety of our non-racial democracy, we can even feel some sympathy for the National Party members who shared Parliament with you. Knowing what a thorn in the flesh of even your friends and political allies you can be, your forthright fearlessness must have made life hell for them when confronted by you.&quot;

She opposed economic sanctions as counterproductive and harmful to poor blacks. After Mandela&#x27;s release &quot;she was prominent among those...who persuaded him to drop the ANC&#x27;s revolutionary program in favour of an evolutionary one, retaining a market economy and a parliamentary democracy.&quot; She continued to be a critic after the fall of Apartheid. According to her biographer, Lord Robin Renwick, before and after the ANC came to power, she continued to speak out against those in power who would &quot;put party and state above the individual whether black or white&quot;.

Some in the ANC and SACP were critical of her method of opposition to apartheid. She was denounced as an agent of colonialism and &quot;part of the system&quot; as well as for her failure to back sanctions. Mandela remained an admirer, saying &quot;the consistency with which you defended the basic values of freedom and the rule of law over the last three decades has earned you the admiration of many South Africans.&quot; So did many others in the anti-apartheid movement, including Winnie Mandela.

Suzman was awarded 27 honorary doctorates from universities around the world, including from Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge. She was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and received numerous other awards from religious and human rights organisations around the world. Former Queen of South Africa, Elizabeth II made her an honorary Dame Commander (Civil Division) of the Order of the British Empire in 1989.

She was awarded the Order for Meritorious Service, Class I, Gold by Nelson Mandela in 1997. She was voted No. 24 in the Top 100 Great South Africans TV series.

She was awarded the Freedom of the City of Kingston upon Hull in 1987.

Suzman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2008.

Liberia issued a postage stamp to honour Suzman in March 2011, calling her one of the legendary heroes of Africa.

In November 2017, the South African Post Office announced that it &quot;has honoured this great, brave and pioneering woman with a rare gesture of a postage stamp&quot; as an &quot;indication of her importance to the country and to the liberation thereof and to that of women&quot;.

The Progressive Federal Party of which Suzman was the sole Parliamentary representative between 1961 and 1973 became the Democratic Party after merging with the National Democratic Movement and the Independent Party in 1989. The Democratic Party was renamed the Democratic Alliance (DA) in 2000. In November 2017, former DA leader Mmusi Maimane paid tribute to Suzman, noting that &quot;Every value we call our own in the DA can be traced back to the principles Helen fought for over her 36-year-long career as a Member of Parliament&quot;.

The poet George Szirtes wrote the poem &quot;Song&quot; in her honor.

The Helen Suzman Foundation was founded in 1993 to honour the life work of Helen Suzman. The Foundation seeks to promote the values espoused by Helen Suzman throughout her public life and in her devotion to public service.

==Death==

Suzman died in her sleep of natural causes on 1 January 2009. She was 91 years old. Achmat Dangor, the Nelson Mandela Foundation chief executive, said Suzman was a &quot;great patriot and a fearless fighter against apartheid&quot;. Flags in South Africa flew at half-mast in her honour. She was buried in a private Jewish ceremony at Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg led by chief rabbi Warren Goldstein.

<text>Annibale de Gasparis (; 9 November 1819 – 21 March 1892) was an Italian astronomer, known for discovering asteroids and his contributions to theoretical astronomy.

==Biography==
De Gasparis was born in 1819 in Bugnara to Angelo de Gasparis and Eleonora Angelantoni originally from Tocco da Casauria. Son of a doctor, he studied in the seminars of Sulmona and Chieti, becoming passionate of classic novels and learning mathematics as a self-taught person. In 1838 he arrived in Naples to study engineering at the School of Bridges and Roads, today&#x27;s Engineering faculty of Naples University, and the following year he was accepted as a student at the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte by the director Ernesto Capocci. He studied mathematics and celestial mechanics and in 1845 he published his first scientific paper on the orbit of the minor planet Vesta. For this studies he earned, as early as 1846, the honorary degree in mathematics by the University of Naples.

In 1848 he participated in the liberal movements, he avoided the Bourbon repression dedicating to the King Ferdinand II his first discovery: the asteroid Hygiea, made on 12 April 1849 with the equatorial telescope of Reichenbach &amp; Utzschneider, giving it the name of Igea Borbonica. In 1850, Capocci was dismissed as director of the observatory due to his participation in the liberal revolts. De Gasparis refused to assume the position of observatory director in deference to his mentor and friend Capocci.

In 1858 he was appointed professor of astronomy in Naples University.

After the death of Capocci, 6 January 1864, he was appointed as director of the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte in Naples. Due to his illness he left the observatory in 1889 going to live in a country house not far from the Observatory.

De Gasparis married Giuseppina Russo in 1848, and they had 9 children together, 3 of which died in infancy.

De Gasparis published more than 200 scientific papers on mathematics, celestial mechanics, astronomy and meteorology.

He and others occasionally wrote his name as Annibal de Gasparis.

== Discoveries ==
Annibale de Gasparis discovered visually the following nine asteroids. In addition, he also independently discovered 14 Irene, which discovery was, however, credited to the English astronomer John Russell Hind.


==Honors and awards==
He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1851. He was also awarded the Lalande Prize from 1849 to 1853.

On 20 January 1861 he was appointed Senator of the Kingdom of Italy for his high scientific merits.

Recipient of the Order of the Red Eagle, and of the Order of the Rose.

The main-belt asteroid 4279 De Gasparis as well as the 30-kilometer lunar crater &quot;de Gasparis&quot; and the nearby 93-kilometer long fracture Rimae de Gasparis, are named in his honour.

<text>The Road of Life () was the set of ice road transport routes across Lake Ladoga to Leningrad during the Second World War. They were the only Soviet winter surface routes into the city while it was besieged by the German Army Group North under &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb.

The routes operated in the winters of 1941-1942 and 1942-1943. Construction and operation were performed under German artillery and aerial bombardment. In January 1943 the Soviet&#x27;s Operation Iskra broke the encirclement, and the ice roads were used in conjunction with land routes for the remainder of the winter.

The routes carried supplies necessary to sustain life and resistance inside the Leningrad pocket, and evacuated non-combatants, wounded, and industrial equipment. Over 1.3 million people, primarily women and children, were evacuated over the roads during the siege.

The Road of Life is now a World Heritage Site.

==History==
===The blockade forms===
On 8 September 1941, Army Group North captured Shlisselburg on the shores of Lake Ladoga, east of Leningrad, and took control of all land routes to Leningrad. This followed the capture of Mga, south of Shlisselburg, on 29 August which cut the city off from the Soviet railway network. The Soviets fell back onto transport by ship over Lake Ladoga and by air; the evacuation of strategic industries and personnel, and shipments of munitions from Leningrad, continued.

On 16 October, the Germans launched an offensive toward Tikhvin and the last Soviet railroad from Moscow to Lake Ladoga that ran through it. Cutting the railroad precipitated the fall of Leningrad. The Soviet Leningrad Front under General Ivan Fedyuninsky launched its own offensive toward Sinyavino on 20 October to recapture Shlisselburg corridor and break the encirclement. The offensive achieved little, and was cancelled on 28 October due to the severity of the German attack. On 8 November, the Germans captured Tikhvin and reached the outskirts of Volkhov. The railroad cut was temporary; the exhausted Germans could not hold the salient in worsening weather and against increasing Soviet pressure. The slow Soviet counteroffensive began on 12 November, and by the end of December the Germans were pushed back to much where they had been before their Tikhvin offensive.

===Winter 1941-1942===

In late October 1941, with the failure of Leningrad Front&#x27;s Sinyavino offensive, and the developing German Tikhvin offensive, Soviet &quot;Stavka&quot; became pessimistic about breaking the Leningrad encirclement and deeply concerned about the possibility of the city&#x27;s isolation. With the Leningrad Front unable to lift the blockade, Stavka ordered the construction of a supply route over Lake Ladoga before the lake had frozen. On 19 November, the Leningrad Front ordered the construction of the 101st BAD (&quot;voenno-avtomobil&#x27;naia doroga&quot;, or military vehicular road) ice road across the lake from Kobona to Vaganova via Shlisselburg Bay, spanning 27-32 km. A second longer road, the 102nd BAD, was constructed to bypass German-occupied Tikhvin from the north. A 27 km road from Kokkorevo to Vaganova via Kloch&#x27;ia Island was built between 18 and 28 November, followed by more roads to the north as the ice thickened. Expansion of the ice roads and their capacity continued until the spring thaw in April 1942.

The first supplies were transported over the road on 19 November 1941 by a transport regiment under Captain Mikhail Murov using horse-drawn sleigh. The first trucks - a column of 60 under Major V. A. Porchunov - arrived on the western shore on the night of 22 November. The Soviets struggled with truck availability and losses. On the ice, trucks became stuck in snowdrifts, abandoned after their drivers became lost, or sank due to poor ice conditions exacerbated by enemy fire. The poor feeder forest roads from Zaborye - the closest railhead before the recapture of Tikhvin - exacted their own toll in abandoned and unserviceable vehicles. According to Salisbury, at one point 1300 or 3500 trucks were out of service, and 1004 were lost overall.

On the day of the first truck convoy, Leningrad officials asked the State Defense Committee (GKO) to support the road. Joseph Stalin tentatively approved, but he failed to appreciate the importance and only limited resources were committed. The Leningrad Front planned the ice roads to bring 1965 tonnes of supplies to the city per day, but this was not initially met. Little was achieved in the first weeks of operation. The number of vehicles that could be assembled from Leningrad was limited. A severe winter in late-November, as well as a surprise thaw starting on 30 November reduced traffic. The supply organization was poor leading Andrey Khrulyov, head of the Rear of the Red Army, to order Andrei Zhdanov, the Leningrad Communist Party secretary, to make the ice road more efficient on 7 December; performance slowly improved after Zhdanov and Alexey Kuznetsov took charge of the supply effort. Soviet strategy also interfered. The Soviets hoped that the recapture of Tikhvin on 8 December and the reopening of the railroad would permit the Red Army to break the encirclement in the short-term; this may have led to traffic on the road stopping on 8 December and operations being formally suspended on 12 December. 

Traffic resumed by late-December. By this time, the railhead was at Voibokalo near Shlisselburg Bay. By the end of December the ice was 1 metre thick and covered by 30 centimeters of snow, able to support unlimited use and heavy vehicles. On 23 December, the delivered amount - 786 tonnes - exceeded the city&#x27;s daily consumption rate for the first time. State support began arriving in January 1942. The GKO sent Alexei Kosygin to Leningrad to improve road operations on 19 January. Kosygin requested support to evacuate 500,000 civilians on 21 January. The request was approved by Stalin the next day and led to much greater support for the road. Throughput was increased by running more convoys per road per day, which placed great pressure on drivers. As a result, throughput finally reached the Front&#x27;s target on 18 January 1942, and continued to increase in the second half of the January. Further improvements came from extending the railroad from Voibokalo to the edge of the lake at Kobona and Kosa. The GKO ordered the extensions on 11 January and they entered service on 20 February and 6 March respectively. In the final three weeks, the roads delivered 4.5 times more supplies than they had in November and December 1941.

Shipments of food permitted a series of ration increases from late December, and by February 1942 civilians in the Leningrad pocket received rations comparable to those elsewhere in the Soviet Union. When the ice roads melted, reserves - rebuilt from mid-January - were sufficient to last until ship traffic on the lake resumed.

Other supplies in the spring of 1942 partially revived factory production and city transport; fuel had run out in January.

Personnel and goods were evacuated from the pocket over the roads. Industrial evacuation was prioritized when the roads opened on Stalin&#x27;s orders. Leningrad was left to evacuate civilians as best it could; only 36,118 evacuees, plus an unknown number who bribed truck drivers or illegally made the trip on foot, crossed the lake out of the pocket between 6 December and 22 January. Large scale civilian evacuation - mainly of those unable to work, such as women, children and the infirm - only began in late-January 1942 with the large allocation of resources and vehicles by the GKO; 554,186 civilians were evacuated from 22 January to 15 April. 35,000 wounded soldiers were also evacuated. Industrial equipment from 86 plants and factories and some art and museum collections were evacuated starting in December 1941, and 20% of the 3677 railroad cars were transferred over the ice roads.

Traffic was progressively curtailed starting in March with the onset of the spring thaw. That month the Germans intensified their air attacks on the ice road, including round-the-clock attacks on some days. The ice roads were declared out of service on 21 April. A final shipment of 64 tonnes of spring onions was made on 23-24 April, and vehicular traffic ended the next day. In total, 356,000 tons of supplies were transported, including 271,000 tons of food, 32,000 tons of military supplies, and 37,000 tons of fuel.

===Energy infrastructure===
On 2 April 1942, a meeting at the Kremlin with the Anastas Mikoyan approved construction plans for an underwater fuel pipeline through Lake Ladoga to Leningrad. Piping was sourced from the Izhorsk factory in the city. The State Defense Committee ordered the Red Army to construct the pipeline on 25 April, and it entered service on 18 June. The pipeline was 35 km long and 12 m. deep, and delivered 295 tonnes of fuel per day. 

The city began receiving electricity from the power plant at Volkhov through an underwater cable in September 1942. 

===Winter 1942-1943===
The Soviets built new ice roads for the winter of 1942-1943. The winter of 1942-1943 was milder than the last; the roads were serviceable for a shorter time as the lake froze later and thawed sooner. The road opened on 19 December and the first convoy crossed the next day. Longer truck columns were used to compensate for the limited load per truck. Thaws closed the road from 9 to 12 January, and finally on 30 March. The roads were serviceable for 101 days between 20 December and 30 March, of which only 97 were suitable for mass truck movement. Trucks moved 210,000 tonnes of supplies, mainly food and ammunition, and over 200,000 personnel and evacuees moved over the roads.

The Soviets also started construction of a railroad over the ice. 15 km of track on the western edge of the lake was complete by mid-January.

The Soviets launched Operation Iskra in January 1943 and retook the Shlisselburg corridor. Construction of the lake railroad was abandoned. A railroad from Shlisselburg to Poliana through the recaptured land route began construction on 21 January and opened on 6 February; it became the main supply route to the city. The ice roads remained operational for the remainder of the winter as reliable alternatives to the railroad. Retaking the Shlisselburg corridor prevented the Germans artillery from bombarding the ice road, although ineffective air attacks continued. The new railroad drew heavy German artillery fire and required frequent repairs.

== Construction and maintenance ==
Measuring in length and wide, Lake Ladoga (or Lake Nevo as it was called in ancient times) is one of Europe’s largest lakes. Due to its size and unpredictable weather conditions, many speculated that the construction of an ice road connecting its shores would be impossible.

Although the Russians had previous historical experience in ice road construction (an ice railroad had been laid over the Kola River near Murmansk during World War I, and another over a portion of Lake Baikal during the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway), none of their prior endeavors were as complicated or as urgent as the Ladoga supply route. Even during winter, the region&#x27;s erratic winds were capable of increasing or decreasing the lake&#x27;s water level by as much as within just a few hours. A team of engineers was quickly assembled to ensure that the proposed route would be structurally sound. One Leningrad scientist noted:

&quot;At , of ice would form in 64 hours; at , 4 inches would form in 34 hours, at , 4 inches in 23 hours. A foot of ice [30 cm] would be laid down in 24 days at . It would take 8 days to create a foot of ice at .

Additionally: 
*A minimum of of ice was necessary to support a horse without cargo.
*A minimum of of ice was necessary to support a horse-drawn sleigh with one ton of cargo.
*A minimum of of ice was necessary to support a truck transporting one ton of cargo.

Although only a foot of ice was required to support mass transit along the route, the actual thickness of the ice typically ranged from , a density thick enough for nearly any task.

Construction was carried out in the face of inclement weather, changing and hazardous ice conditions, and German artillery and aerial bombardment which required camouflage and anti-aircraft defences. Roads were configured for around-the-clock, two-way, all-weather operation.

Once the route had been confirmed and tested for stability, larger plows and snow carving machines were then used to widen the ice road and make it more suitable for automobile transport. 1650 of the 1770 km of roads built during the winter of 1941-1942 required repeated snow removal. By February 1942, large snow banks on either side of the route had been made into massive ice walls, which shielded transport from the lake&#x27;s harsh winds. As the ice melted in the spring, the ice road melted, and was replaced with a flotilla system that continued to ferry goods across the massive lake.

As soon as the ice hardened, the Road of Life was reconstructed again in December 1942. Since February 1943 the road became superseded by the land corridor, but ice traffic continued until March 30.

== Operation ==

When the roads opened for the winter of 1941-1942, Leningrad Front deployed an elaborate organization onto the ice to manage and support traffic, which included road guides, communications points, road service commandant posts, medical and rescue service points, feeding points, and combat security posts.

Leningrad Front&#x27;s Road-Commandant Service maintained traffic control posts along the ice roads. Traffic regulators controlled vehicle movement, monitored ice conditions, marked the routes with blackout lanterns, and warned drivers of obstructions or accidents ahead; regulators contributed significantly to the roads&#x27; success. Initially, there were 20 posts at 300-400 metre intervals. By 1 January 1942, there were 75 posts, 350 traffic regulators, and 150-300 blackout lanterns. Later, settling weather and high snow walls flanking the roads made control easier, allowing the interval between posts to increase to 1-2 km.

Soviet forces defended the ice roads, connecting land routes, and other road-related infrastructure.

== After the siege ==
In the summer, with the start of the navigable period, deliveries to the city continued thanks to the Ladoga Military Flotilla. In 1943 the Road of Life was replaced by the – a railway, laid on the narrow path conquered during operation Iskra from Leningrad to Volkhov. Now the Road of Life, within the limits of Saint Petersburg, is often referred to as Ryabovskoe Highway, but within Vsevolozhsk, the Road of Life is the official name.

== Monuments and memorials ==
The Road of Life is commemorated by seven monuments and 46 memorial poles along the road, and 56 memorial poles along the railway; all are part of the Green Belt of Glory (Зелёный пояс славы).

<text>Herbert Tsangtse Kwouk (OBE)(Kwouk; ; ; 18 July 1930 – 24 May 2016) was a British actor. He is perhaps best known for his role as Cato in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films. He made appearances in many television programmes, including a portrayal of Imperial Japanese Army Major Yamauchi in the British drama series &quot;Tenko&quot; and as Entwistle in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;.

==Early life==
Kwouk was born on 18 July 1930 in Warrington, Lancashire, to Chinese parents; his parents were on a business trip touring Europe. He was brought up in Shanghai; his father was a textile tycoon descended from a Tang dynasty general. Between the ages of 12 and 16, he attended the Shanghai Jesuit Mission School, which he described as &quot;the Far East equivalent&quot; of Eton College. He left China in 1947 when his parents returned to Britain, and was sent to the United States to complete his education. In 1953, he graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. The Kwouk family fortune was lost in the Chinese communist revolution in the 1940s. In 1954, he returned to Britain, where a girlfriend &quot;nagged [him] into acting&quot;.

==Career==
Kwouk made his film debut in &quot;Windom&#x27;s Way&quot; (1957). One of his earliest film roles was in &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958) in the role of the leader of a prison revolt who later aids the main character Gladys Aylward (Ingrid Bergman) in heroically leading orphans to safety. He was best known for playing Cato Fong, Inspector Clouseau&#x27;s manservant, in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film series. The character was first introduced in &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964), the second film in the series, and was a role that Kwouk would reprise on another six occasions until the 2006 series reboot. The running gag was that Cato was ordered to attack Clouseau when he least expected it to keep him alert, usually resulting in a ruined romantic encounter or Clouseau&#x27;s flat being completely destroyed. Amid the chaos, the phone would ring and Cato would calmly answer it before dutifully handing the phone to his employer and being thumped by Clouseau.

He was a stalwart of several 1960s ITC television series, such as &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;Man of the World&quot;, when an oriental character was required. He appeared in the episode Assault Force in Return of the Saint. Kwouk featured as one of the leads in the short-lived series &quot;The Sentimental Agent&quot; (1963) and had minor roles in three James Bond films. In &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), he played Mr Ling, a Chinese expert in nuclear fission; in the non-Ian Fleming spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), he played a general and, in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (also 1967), Kwouk played the part of a Japanese operative of Blofeld, credited as Spectre 3. He appeared with Laurence Olivier and Anthony Quinn in &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot;.

A reference to Kwouk&#x27;s appearances in several films with Peter Sellers is found in the opening scene of &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980) where Sellers says to him &quot;your face is familiar.&quot; His next major role was as the honourable but misguided Major Yamauchi in the World War II television drama &quot;Tenko&quot; (1981–1984). Kwouk featured in many British television productions that called for an Oriental actor. As a result, he became a familiar face in the United Kingdom and appeared as himself in the &quot;Harry Hill Show&quot; as well as several of Hill&#x27;s live tours. Burt also had a cameo in &quot;Super Gran&quot; in 1985. He also appeared in the 1985 RKO film &quot;Plenty (film)&quot; as a Burmese diplomat at a dinner party.

In 2000, he appeared in an episode of the syndicated western TV series &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; as Master Kiyomasa, an aged Japanese warrior-priest. Sung-Hi Lee played his female pupil, Kami. He provided voice-overs on the spoof Japanese betting show &quot;Banzai&quot; (2001–2004) and subsequently appeared in adverts for the betting company, Bet365. From 2002 to the series&#x27;s end in 2010, he had a regular role as one of the three main characters in the long-running series &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, as &#x27;Electrical&#x27; Entwistle. His later work also included voice acting for radio drama, video games, and television commercials.

==Personal life==
Kwouk married Caroline Tebbs in Wandsworth, London, in the summer of 1961. Their son Christopher was born in 1974. Kwouk was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to drama. In later years, he lived in Hampstead, London.

==Death==
Kwouk died on 24 May 2016 at the age of 85, from cancer at the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead.

<text>Ralf und Florian (English title: Ralf and Florian) is the third studio album by the German electronic band Kraftwerk. It was released in October 1973 on Philips. It saw the group moving toward their signature electronic sound. It reached #160 on the US Top 200 Albums Chart in 1975.

Along with Kraftwerk&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Ralf und Florian&quot; to date has never been officially re-issued anywhere, nor has the band played any of its material live since the late &#x27;70s. However, the album remains an influential and sought-after work, and bootlegged copies were widely distributed in the 1990s on the &quot;Germanofon&quot; label. In 2008, &quot;Fact&quot; named it among the 20 greatest ambient albums ever made.

==Background==

As indicated by the title (and like their previous album), all the tracks were written, performed and produced by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider, with the sessions engineered by the influential Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank. The album has a fuller and more polished sound quality than previous efforts, and this is clearly due to the use of a number of commercial recording studios in addition to Kraftwerk&#x27;s own yet-to-be-named Kling Klang. The colour photograph on the back of the cover gives a vivid impression of the bohemian state of Kraftwerk&#x27;s own facilities at the time including egg-box trays pasted, nailed, or stuck on the walls as acoustic treatment.

&quot;Fact&quot; stated that the album&#x27;s sound &quot;sits halfway between LSD-fried Kraut prog and the refined minimal art of classic Kraftwerk.&quot; The album is still almost entirely instrumental (some wordless vocalising appears in &quot;Tanzmusik&quot;, and &quot;Ananas Symphonie&quot; features the band&#x27;s first use of a machine voice created by an early prototype vocoder, a sound which would later become a Kraftwerk trademark). Instrumentation begins to show more obvious use of synthesizers (Minimoog and EMS Synthi AKS), but most melodic and harmonic keyboard parts are performed on Farfisa electronic piano/organ. Flute and guitar are still much in evidence. The band was still without a drummer, and several tracks, particularly &quot;Tanzmusik&quot;, make use of a preset organ rhythm machine. &quot;Kristallo&quot; features a striking rhythmic electronic bassline (actually created on the EMS synthesizer with the aid of the vocoder), however, in general the album is much gentler and less rhythmically precise than Kraftwerk&#x27;s later electronic work.

==Release==
The LP included a &quot;musicomic&quot; poster insert of cartoons by Emil Schult, who had been playing electric violin live with the band (although he does not feature on the album recordings). Schult remained a collaborator of Kraftwerk&#x27;s. The cartoons illustrated each track on the album, as well as the city of Düsseldorf, with the caption &quot;In Düsseldorf am Rhein, klingt es bald!&quot;, which translates literally in English as &quot;In Düsseldorf on the Rhine, it will sound soon&quot; (perhaps the phrase &quot;the sound gets around&quot; captures the snappy feel of the maxim better). This is a reference to Kraftwerk&#x27;s Düsseldorf-based Kling Klang studio.

The album was a modest success in Germany. Drummer Wolfgang Flür was recruited to play with Ralf and Florian for a subsequent promotional TV appearance in Berlin, for the German ZDF TV arts show &quot;Aspekte&quot;. He became a member of the group thereafter.

No material from this album has been performed in the band&#x27;s live set since 1976. Though the electronic sound of &quot;Ralf und Florian&quot; is more stylistically similar to &quot;Autobahn&quot; than it is to Kraftwerk&#x27;s first two albums, the band is seemingly reluctant to consider the album a part of its canon Schneider in later interviews referred to the first three Kraftwerk albums as &quot;archaeology&quot;. The band hinted that the album may finally see a re-mastered CD release after issuing the boxed set &quot;The Catalogue&quot; in the autumn of 2009.

<text>The Atari Microsoft BASIC and Atari Microsoft BASIC II variants of the 6502-version of Microsoft BASIC ported to the Atari 8-bit computers. The first version, released 1981, required 32 KB of RAM and was supplied on floppy disk. The second version, released the next year, had most of the code on a ROM cartridge with additional functions on an optional floppy.

Atari Microsoft BASIC was highly compatible with contemporary BASICs like Applesoft BASIC and Commodore BASIC, in contrast to their own Atari BASIC which was a somewhat different dialect and incompatible in many ways. Like Atari BASIC, Atari Microsoft BASIC included a number of new commands and features to take advantage of the Atari platform. These were only partially compatible with the similar features of Atari BASIC.

==History==
When Microsoft ported their originally Intel 8080-based BASIC to the 6502, they took the time to expand the floating-point format from the original 32-bit format to an optional 40-bit format for improved accuracy. Both versions could be compiled from the same code by providing compiler flags; if the 32-bit format used the resulting code was just under 8 KB in length, if the 40-bit format was used, it was closer to 9 KB.

The Atari 8-bit home computers were designed with a slot for an 8 KB ROM cartridge. Atari&#x27;s programmers struggled to fit Microsoft&#x27;s BASIC into a single cartridge while also adding features to take advantage of the platform. In the summer of 1978, Atari decided to outsource the porting effort so that BASIC would be ready in time for the 1979 launch of the system, and this led them to Shepardson Microsystems Inc. (SMI). SMI quickly decided the job was impossible, and instead proposed creating an entirely new version of BASIC. This became Atari BASIC and was released with the Atari 400 and 800 in 1979.

Atari continued working with the MS code and released a version of it on floppy disk in 1981. In addition to the extended range of standard commands in MS compared to Atari BASIC, the new version added a number of additional commands for graphics and sound and other features of the platform. It also included integer variables and a complete integer math package which offered improved performance. However, as it required at least 32 KB of RAM and only ran from a disk, it was never particularly popular.

A second release, Atari Microsoft BASIC II, moved most of the code onto an expanded 16 KB cartridge and placed an additional 11 KB of more rarely used code on disk, meaning that many programs intended for cross-platform use could now be run from the cartridge alone. Released in 1982, BASIC II also saw little real-world use.

==Details==
The underlying interpreter was based on the same 9 KB MOS 6502 code that also formed the basis of Commodore BASIC and AppleSoft BASIC, and was largely compatible with them. A key aspect of this was the string handling system, which was based on the same code as those platforms. In contrast, Atari BASIC used an entirely different system that treated strings as arrays of characters and was not compatible with, nor easily ported from, most other systems.

It retained the original 40-bit format floating-point arithmetic library that replaced the notoriously slow one in the system&#x27;s operating system ROMs, and thus ran math code at the same speed as other platforms, and much faster than Atari BASIC. It also included an additional integer math package for added performance. The integer math system was triggered when the assignment was to an integer variable, or the literal values were all integers. If either was not true, the integer values would be converted to floating-point, use the floating-point code for the calculation, and then be converted back to integer for storage.

Another notable performance-related improvement was related to loops. Atari BASIC performed these by placing the line number of the on the execution stack, so when the associated was encountered it could find which line to loop back to. In contrast, MS BASIC had always placed the memory location of that line on the stack, allowing it to jump back to the without having to search through the entire program for the matching line. This oddity in Atari BASIC is one of the primary reasons for its slow performance, and because this was not true in Atari Microsoft BASIC, it generally ran much faster than Atari BASIC.

In contrast to Atari BASIC, which parsed and tokenized entire lines when they were typed in, MS BASICs only partially tokenized the source code. When a line was entered, the line number was converted from ASCII to a 16-bit integer, the first program statement was tokenized to a single-byte value, and then the rest of the line was left as text format. The last character had its high-bit set to indicate the end of the line. Depending on the use-case, Atari BASIC&#x27;s complete tokenization of the line could result in less memory being used to store the program. This difference also meant that many syntax errors would only be noticed at runtime in the MS code, unlike the Atari version where the entire line was checked at edit time. In theory, edit-time compilation should have made Atari BASIC much faster than MS, which re-tokenizes the line every time it is encountered, but this advantage was washed away by the other performance issues noted above.

MS BASIC did not include a system for entering short forms of keywords, unlike Atari BASIC which allowed them to be abbreviated with a period during entry. When the program was ed, the keywords would be expanded out. Commodore&#x27;s version which added control-character completion to the same end.

Atari Microsoft BASIC added a number of new features to take advantage of the platform. One interesting addition is which waited for the specified number of &quot;jiffies&quot;, 1/60ths of a second, and then performed the . It also included the which instead paused while awaiting a memory address to change before proceeding to the next line. had been part of the earliest versions of MS BASIC but not widely used.

Atari Microsoft BASIC included most of the graphics and sound commands from Atari BASIC. Oddly, the original was merged into using the optional format. This means graphics code for Atari BASIC was not compatible. Atari Microsoft BASIC added a number of additional commands for handling player/missile graphics and user-defined character sets that were not available in Atari BASIC.

&quot;Atari Microsoft BASIC&quot; came in two packages:
* Floppy disk – CX8126
* ROM cartridge – RX8035. Since the cartridge could only hold 16 KB, the remaining 11 KB file was included on an &quot;extension&quot; disk. The cartridge version was called &quot;Atari Microsoft BASIC II&quot;.

Although more feature-filled than Atari BASIC, Microsoft BASIC never had the popularity that Atari BASIC had. The biggest problems were:
* increased memory needed (at least 32 KB)
* disk drive required
* performance (faster than Atari BASIC, but slower than Turbo-Basic XL and BASIC XL)
* not compatible with Atari BASIC
* added cost

The cartridge version eliminated the first two requirements, but a disk drive was needed for all of its features.

<text>A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. The term &quot;virtual dedicated server&quot; (VDS) has a similar meaning.

A virtual private server runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes, it is functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server and, being software-defined, can be created and configured more easily. A virtual server costs less than an equivalent physical server. However, as virtual servers share the underlying physical hardware with other VPS, performance may be lower depending on the workload of any other executing virtual machines.

== Virtualization ==
The force driving server virtualization is similar to that which led to the development of time-sharing and multiprogramming in the past. Although the resources are still shared, as under the time-sharing model, virtualization provides a higher level of security, dependent on the type of virtualization used, as the individual virtual servers are mostly isolated from each other and may run their own full-fledged operating system which can be independently rebooted as a virtual instance.

Partitioning a single server to appear as multiple servers has been increasingly common on microcomputers since the release of VMware ESX Server in 2001. The physical server typically runs a hypervisor which is tasked with creating, releasing, and managing the resources of &quot;guest&quot; operating systems, or virtual machines. These guest operating systems are allocated a share of resources of the physical server, typically in a manner in which the guest is not aware of any other physical resources except for those allocated to it by the hypervisor. As a VPS runs its own copy of its operating system, customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, and can install almost any software that runs on the OS; however, due to the number of virtualization clients typically running on a single machine, a VPS generally has limited processor time, RAM, and disk space.

== Hosting ==
Many companies offer virtual private server hosting or virtual dedicated server hosting as an extension for web hosting services. There are several challenges to consider when licensing proprietary software in multi-tenant virtual environments.

With &quot;unmanaged&quot; or &quot;self-managed&quot; hosting, the customer is left to administer their own server instance.

&quot;Unmetered&quot; hosting is generally offered with no limit on the amount of data transferred on a fixed bandwidth line. Usually, unmetered hosting is offered with 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, or 1000 Mbit/s (with some as high as 10 Gbit/s). This means that the customer is theoretically able to use approximately 3 TB on 10 Mbit/s or up to approximately 300 TB on a 1000 Mbit/s line per month; although in practice the values will be significantly less. In a virtual private server, this will be shared bandwidth and a fair usage policy should be involved. &quot;Unlimited&quot; hosting is also commonly marketed but generally &quot;limited&quot; by acceptable usage policies and terms of service. Offers of unlimited disk space and bandwidth are always false due to cost, carrier capacities, and technological boundaries.

<doc id="555305" wikidata="Q16707899" url="?curid=555305" title="Jihad of Usman dan Fodio">
<text>The Jihad of Usman dan Fodio was a religio-military conflict in present-day Nigeria and Cameroon. The war began when Usman dan Fodio, a prominent Islamic scholar and teacher, was exiled from Gobir by King Yunfa, one of his former students.

Usman dan Fodio assembled an Islamic army to lead a jihad against Gobir and other Hausa Kingdoms of northern Nigeria. The forces of Usman dan Fodio slowly took over more and more of the Hausa kingdoms, capturing Gobir in 1808 and executing Yunfa. The war resulted in the creation of the Sokoto Caliphate, initially headed by Usman dan Fodio himself, which became one of the largest states in Africa in the 19th century. His success inspired similar jihads in Western Africa.

==Background==
The ancient Kanem–Bornu Empire was losing power by the mid-18th century. There was large-scale immigration by Fulani pastoralists, leading to resource competition with more settled Hausa communities despite their shared religion. Several Hausa kingdoms previously tributary to Kanem-Bornu became independent and fought with each other. Rulers enforced harsh systems of conscription and taxation, while war caused social disruption, economic hardship, and enslavement of war captives. Fulani communities felt especially victimized by Hausa rulers&#x27; taxation and land control. Two prominent Hausa kingdoms that were central in the Jihad were Gobir, where Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s parents settled in his childhood and where he lived until 1804, and Zamfara. 

==Lead up to war==
Usman dan Fodio, born in 1754, joined a growing number of traveling Islamic scholars through the Hausa kingdoms in the 1770s and became quite popular in the 1790s. Much of his preaching focused on the obligations of Muslim rulers to promote Islam and to rule ethically and generously in a manner that allowed their subjects to live as good Muslims while criticizing corruption, hypocrisy, oppression of fellow Muslims, and tolerance of beliefs and practices in conflict with Islam. Originally, dan Fodio&#x27;s preaching received the support of the leadership of Gobir; however, as his influence increased and as he began to advocate for self-defense arming by his followers, his favor with the leadership decreased. King Nafata of Gobir, placed a series of restrictions on preaching by dan Fodio&#x27;s followers and by Usman himself. In 1801, Sarkin Gobir Yunfa, a former pupil of dan Fodio, replaced Nafata as king and increased the restrictions on dan Fodio, exiling him from Gobir to the village of Degel. A crisis developed later in 1803 when Yunfa attacked and captured many of the followers of a group associated with dan Fodio. Yunfa then marched the prisoners through Degel, enraging many of dan Fodio&#x27;s followers, who attacked the army and freed the prisoners.

Yunfa gave dan Fodio the option of exile before destroying Degel, but Usman refused to abandon his followers, instead leading a large-scale &quot;hijra&quot; of the community to Gudu. So many people went with dan Fodio throughout the state that on February 21, 1804, Yunfa declared war on dan Fodio and threatened punishment to anyone joining him. Followers of dan Fodio declared him to be the Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin &quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot; and renounced their allegiance to Gobir.

=== In Kanem-Bornu ===
The earliest recorded mention of the Fulani in Kanem-Bornu dates back to the arrival of a group of Fulani envoys from the Emperor of Mali at the court of the &quot;Mai&quot; (ruler) of Kanem during the reign of Kashim Biri (r. 1242–1262). A steady flow of Fulani pastoralists and Islamic scholars continued to settle in Hausaland and Kanem-Bornu. By the turn of the 19th-century, there were numerous Fulani groups living in Bornu. Before the jihad, most of these groups lived in relative peace with their Bornu neighbours. It was even customary for the Mais to go to war with other tribes to protect the Fulani from raids. However, perhaps due to the political ambitions of some of the Fulani, the Sayfawa princes developed a general hostility towards the Fulani in the 18th-century.

In the late 18th-century, the Galadima of Bornu, Dunama, administered a large district in western Bornu, which contained numerous Fulani groups and encompassed portions of what later became the emirates of Hadejia, Katagum, Jamaare, and Misau. Three figures led the jihad in this area: Bi Abdur, Lerlima, and Ibrahim Zaki. Bi Abdur lived near Hadejia and, around 1800, persuaded the Sarkin Hadejia (ruler of Hadejia) to appoint him as the leader of the local Fulani. He had considerable animosity towards the Galadima, who was responsible for his father&#x27;s death. Lerlima, Bi Abdur&#x27;s maternal cousin, was married to the Galadima&#x27;s daughter and served in his administration, possibly as a tax collector. Ibrahim Zaki was a widely travelled &quot;mallam&quot; (Islamic teacher) and was familiar with the teachings of Shehu Usman.

To the south of the empire, a similar situation existed. The jihad was primarily led by Fulani groups centered at Deya (today in Gujba, Yobe State). During the late 18th-century, the local ruler of Deya, Muhammad Lafia, &quot;because of his recalcitrant ways&quot; was deposed by the Mai of Bornu, Ahmad. He was replaced with his younger brother, Muhammad Saurima, who the Mai hoped would be more cooperative. The local Fulani leadership, including two learned men, al-Bukhari and Goni Mukhtar, was displeased with Lafia&#x27;s deposition as he had maintained friendly relations with the Fulani.

==Battles==
Several minor skirmishes preceded the forces meeting at the Battle of Tsuntua. Although Yunfa was victorious and dan Fodio lost men, the battle did not diminish his force. He retaliated by capturing the village of Matankari, which resulted in the Battle of Tabkin Kwatto, a major action between Yunfa and dan Fodio&#x27;s forces. Both the Gobirawa and Dan Fodio armies were ethnically mixed. The Gobirawa had some Tuaregs and Fulanis from the Sullubawa clan while the Muslims had Hausa, Fulani and a few Iwellemmedan Tuaregs. The Tuaregs of the Muslim army consisted of Agali and Adagh muslims and possibly the sons of the Emir of Adagh. Although outnumbered, dan Fodio&#x27;s troops were able to prevent Yunfa from advancing on Gunu and thus convince larger numbers of people to join his forces.

In 1805, the forces of dan Fodio, the &quot;jihadists&quot;, captured the Hausa kingdom of Kebbi. In 1807, the jihadists had taken over Katsina whose ruler, Magajin Halidu, committed suicide following the defeat. They then captured the Sultanate of Kano whose king (Muhammad Alwali II) was forced to flee to Zazzau, then the village of Burum-Burum where he was soon killed in battle. In 1808, the jihadists assaulted Gobir, killing Yunfa in the battle of Alkalawa, and destroying large parts of the city. Furthermore, Abdullahi dan Fodio also took over the Kebbi Emirate the same year.

With the capture of Gobir, the jihadists saw that they were part of a wider regional struggle. They continued with battles against several Hausa kingdoms, and the Sokoto Caliphate expanded over the next two years. The last major expansion of the jihadists was the toppling of the Sayfawa dynasty in 1846.

==Founding of the Sokoto Caliphate==
Muhammed Bello, the son of Usman dan Fodio, transformed the semi-permanent camp of Sokoto into a city in 1809, during the Fulani war. Dan Fodio ruled from Sokoto as the religious leader of the Fulani jihad states from that point until 1815, when he retired from administrative duties. The Caliphate appointed various Emirs to govern the various states of the empire. These men were often veterans of the Fulani wars. Bello succeeded Usman dan Fodio as ruler of Sokoto and in 1817 adopted the title of sultan, an office that still exists, albeit stripped of most of its power by the British colonial government of Nigeria in 1903.

==Legacy==
The success of the jihad inspired a number of later West African jihadists, including Massina Empire founder Seku Amadu, Toucouleur Empire founder Omar Saidou Tall, Wassoulou Empire founder Samori, Adamawa Emirate founder Modibo Adama and Zabarma Emirate founder Babatu (warlord).

The consequences of this Jihad reached far beyond West Africa, influencing regions as far as South America. Many recently enslaved individuals taken from these areas, who were already trained in military tactics, were highly able to stage numerous revolts in Portuguese Brazil that occurred during the 19th century.

The Sokoto Caliphate has continued to the present. Since the British conquest of the Caliphate in 1903, and later Nigerian independence under a constitutional government in 1960, the Caliphate&#x27;s political authority has diminished. But the position still has considerable spiritual authority.

<text>Daniel Sidney Warner (June 25, 1842 – December 12, 1895) was an American church reformer and one of the founders of the Church of God (Anderson) and other similar church groups in the holiness movement. He called for evangelism, the preaching of entire sanctification, and the unity of Christians.

Warner taught the Restorationist concept of restoring the Church to New Testament practice. He is also known for some of his songs which other church groups have incorporated into their hymnody. He is mostly known by only the initials of his given and middle name, D. S. Warner, which was typical for his time period.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Daniel Sidney Warner was born June 25, 1842, in Bristol (now Marshallville), Ohio, to David and Leah Warner. His father ran a tavern at the time of his birth and later was known for his drinking, but his mother, of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, is recorded by Warner to have been more virtuous. He was the fifth of six children. His speaking abilities were noted even in his youth, when he would occasionally give political speeches in his home area. During the American Civil War, Warner volunteered to serve as a private for the Union to replace his brother, Joseph Warner, who had been drafted, since Joseph had a family.
===Early Christian life===
Warner became a Christian in February 1865, at the age of 23. He attended Oberlin College for a short while and taught in the public schools. On Easter Sunday of 1867, Warner preached his first sermon in a Methodist Episcopal meeting using Acts 13:18 as his text.

In September of the same year, he married Tamzen Ann Kerr and in October was licensed to preach by the Winebrennarian Church of God. In May 1872, Tamzen Warner died after the birth of their still-born triplets. She had already borne a son who died at birth.

Warner was an effective evangelist in the Winebrennarian church (over 700 people responded to his altar calls during the first decade of his ministry), preaching throughout northwest Ohio and northern Indiana for about six years. He was then assigned a mission post in Nebraska for two years, a work to which he gave himself wholeheartedly, even if it meant long, lonely spells of absence from his wife, Sarah Keller, whom he had married on June 4, 1874.

===Holiness movement===
He returned to Ohio, and on July 7, 1877, he claimed to have experienced entire sanctification and aligned himself with the holiness movement. Earlier in his life, he had rejected the behavior of the holiness movement, writing of a certain meeting: &quot;Nearly all blew loudly the horn of sanctification but manifested little of its fruits...&quot; However, through the influence of his in-laws, he began to think favorably of the growing holiness movement. It would ultimately give the course of his life a new direction.

On September 15, 1877, the first charges of associating with the holiness movement were brought against him by the Winebrennerian Church of God, which were sustained shortly thereafter by a church trial. His license to preach was renewed on the condition that he would not bring &quot;holiness&quot; workers in to hold meetings in the Churches of God (Winebrennarian) without their consent.

On December 8 of the same year, he consecrated himself to God to be an evangelist in the growing movement. On December 13, 1877, his diary entry contains his Covenant with God: “Amen, LORD. I am yours, forever. Fill me with Your presence, now. LORD, reveal Yourself in me. At Your feet I humbly bow to receive the holy seal.”

On January 30, 1878, he was expelled from the West Ohio Eldership of the Church of God (Winebrennarian) on three counts: 1) transcending the restrictions of the Eldership 2) violating rules of cooperation, 3) participating in dividing the church. In his own eyes, Warner felt he was expelled for espousing and preaching entire sanctification. After his expulsion, he sought fellowship with various groups, including some Mennonites and the Salvation Army.

Even this time of fruitful ministry was marred by personal sorrow. His three-year-old daughter, Levilla Modest, died of meningitis in June 1878, the fifth child that Warner was forced to bury.

===New movement===
The Winebrennarian Church of God eventually suffered a division over the issue of membership in secret societies. Coming into contact with the side that opposed membership in these societies (Northern Indiana Eldership of the Church of God, which also was more open to holiness teachings), Warner joined with them. But not long after, in October, 1881, he separated from this group at its Eldership meeting at Beaver Dam, Indiana, when the elders rejected some proposals made by him. Five other persons &quot;took a stand&quot; with Warner and they formed the first congregation of the new movement.

Also in October 1881, Joseph C. and Allie R. Fisher, along with about eighteen others, separated from the Northern Michigan Eldership of the Church of God (Winebrennarian) at Carson City, Michigan, forming the second congregation. These congregations were the culmination of Warner&#x27;s desire for non-sectarian Holiness congregations, of which he had dreamed since January 31, 1878, when he noted in his diary: &quot;On the 31st of last January the Lord showed me that holiness could never prosper upon sectarian soil encumbered by human creeds and party names, and he gave me a new commission to join holiness and all truth together and build up the apostolic church of the living God. Praise His name! I will obey him.&quot;

On April 22, 1881, Warner &quot;came out&quot; of all holiness associations, saying, &quot;We were positively denied membership [in any holiness association] on the ground of not adhering to any sect. And now we wish to announce to all that we wish to cooperate with all Christians, as such, in saving souls—but forever withdraw from all organisms that uphold and endorse sects and denominations in the body of Christ.&quot; &quot;Anti-sectarianism&quot; would become a watchword for his followers for many years afterward. His detractors would call his movement the &quot;come-outers&quot;.

===Personal grief===
During 1890, Sarah Warner divorced D. S. Warner. They had lived separated since 1884. The issues surrounding their separation remain somewhat clouded, but when she filed for divorce, she claimed that Daniel was not supporting her financially. Three months after the separation, she turned over custody of Sidney, the only child of Daniel Warner to survive past childhood, to Daniel. Later, she remarried. In 1893, she died of typhoid fever at Cincinnati, Ohio. Believing it wrong to remarry as long as he had a living spouse, Daniel did not remarry until Sarah had died. A few months after her death, he was united in marriage to Francis Miller, his third and last wife.

===Publishing ventures===
On March 11, 1879, Warner became half owner and joint editor with I. W. Lowman of the &quot;Herald of Gospel Freedom&quot;. The following year, he was given complete charge of this publication. During 1880, D S. Warner published his first book, &quot;Bible Proofs of the Second Work of Grace.&quot; In the minds of early Church of God leaders, this action signified the beginning of the Church of God Reformation movement. The following year, the &quot;Herald of Gospel Freedom&quot; was consolidated with &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (published in Indianapolis, Indiana by G. Haines) to become the &quot;Gospel Trumpet.&quot; This publication would continue for many decades after his death as the official publication of the movement which was just now gaining momentum. (The &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; was renamed &quot;Vital Christianity&quot; in 1962 and ceased publication in 1996.)

Under Warner, the first two issues of the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; were published in Rome City, Indiana. But Warner moved his printing equipment to Indianapolis early in 1881. In June 1881, G. Haines dissolved the partnership with Warner and started an opposition holiness paper. J.C. Fisher then joined D.S. Warner as partner in the &quot;Gospel Trumpet.&quot; Fisher&#x27;s name disappeared from the paper&#x27;s masthead in early 1887 after he divorced his wife and married a divorcee named Alice Davis.

On June 21, 1887, Enoch E. Byrum purchased Fisher&#x27;s share of the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; and became its publisher and business manager. Byrum would edit this paper for nearly twenty years after the death of Warner. (In several letters and editorials, Warner held out the hope that Fisher would reconcile with his ex-wife and return to the movement, but he did not.)

===Evangelistic efforts===
In the fall of 1884, Warner conducted revival tours and preached at camp meetings in the midwestern United States. He formed an evangelistic preaching company in the summer of 1886 with members including Nannie Kiger of Payne, Ohio; Francis Miller (his later wife) of Battle Creek, Michigan; Sarah Smith of Jerry City, Ohio; John U. Bryant and David Leininger of Beaver Dam, Indiana; and Barney E. Warren of Lacota, Michigan.

From June 1887 to April 1888, Warner conducted an evangelistic tour through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado. During the same summer, he preached at camp meetings in Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The following winter, he conducted an evangelistic tour to Ontario, Canada.

In the winter of 1890, Warner conducted a southern evangelistic tour into Mississippi and Alabama. His evangelistic company dissolved after this tour.

During 1891, he conducted evangelistic tours in Pennsylvania and Ontario, Canada. In August 1892 to February 1893, he conducted an evangelistic tour as far as California.

===Final years===
In January through February 1894, Warner helped with an evangelistic tour down the Ohio River on a refloated barge known as the Floating Bethel. On December 1, 1895, Daniel Sidney Warner preached his last sermon on Sunday morning at the Gospel Trumpet Office in Grand Junction, Michigan. The topic of his sermon was Christian growth.

E.E. Byrum and his brother Noah Byrum purchased the remaining publishing business interests of Allie R. Fisher and a local lumberman named Sebastian Michels. Two days before Warner&#x27;s death, he and the Byrum brothers signed papers conveying their rights to a nonprofit corporation named the Gospel Trumpet Publishing Company (now Warner Press, Inc., located in Anderson, Indiana).

Warner died on December 12, 1895, and was buried on the Church of God campgrounds at Grand Junction.

===Personal interests===
Warner wrote many poems and songs. Most of his song lyrics were set to music by others, chiefly Barney E. Warren. His strong admiration for the beauty of nature revealed itself in his poetry.

Warner was interested in health foods such as graham flour and he resolved to incorporate these foods into his diet. He wrote in one of his field reports to the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot;, &quot;One thing we much regret that there is not more wisdom among the saints respecting healthy diet. Laboring in five counties in Ind. and two in Mich., we have not found a single family that did not have pork on their table about every meal. In fact we do not recollect a single meal without pork. Now this is a very unhealthy food ... Another great pity is the common use of white bread. O that God may keep His saints from thus wasting the precious wheat He gives us. Warner also studied and lectured occasionally on phrenology, which attempted to determine one&#x27;s personality traits and acumen by measuring the size and shape of that person&#x27;s head.

==Doctrines and beliefs==
Although he did not consider himself to be a theologian as such, Warner&#x27;s theology was rooted in several sources. He seems to have been an avid reader, and had friends across a broad spectrum of denominations from which he gleaned his insights. From the Wesleyan tradition he took his view of salvation. From the Winebrennarian Church of God he gained his view of the Church. From the Anabaptists, he picked up non-resistance and non-conformity, and from the Adventists he took some of his eschatology. From the Restorationist tradition, he inherited the view of restoring the Church to New Testament practice. His two prominent teachings stand out as the &quot;one Church&quot;: all believers are members of the church of God. He taught in his booklet &quot;What the Church of God Is and What it is Not&quot; that the call to join various bodies must be of the Antichrist. He wrote, &quot;Therefore the multiplicity of sects, falsely called churches, are not God’s church.&quot;

His other prominent theme was that of holiness.

The following is an overview of the main doctrines that characterized Warner&#x27;s life and teachings:
*One Church called the &quot;Church of God&quot;, which is composed of all the &quot;saved&quot; people; no membership list
*Holiness of life-freedom from sin; a life dedicated to the Kingdom of God and its mission. This was accomplished by a &quot;second, definite, work of grace&quot;; the baptism of the Holy Ghost that purified the heart of the sin nature
*Against &quot;Babylon&quot;; that is, all false religion that held a different name or espoused teachings outside or independent of the Word of God
*The imminent second coming of Christ. Warner said &quot;the Lord has promised him that he should live until Jesus returned.&quot;
*Non-resistance; non-participation in the military
*Separation from &quot;the world&quot; in actions, beliefs, and lifestyle, which included modesty of dress without added adornment of jewelry, cosmetics, neckties, etc., and opposition to membership in secret societies
*Foot washing, baptism by immersion, and the Lord&#x27;s Supper as ordinances
*Leadership led by the Holy Ghost, rather than &quot;man-rule&quot; that dictates what the local minister can preach, with no official ministerial training or salaries, permitting women in the ministry
*Divine healing by faith without the assistance of doctors
*Marriage as &quot;one man-one woman&quot; for life, with no remarriage while the first spouse remained alive. For some second marriages already consummated before conversion, the couple was left to decide for themselves if they should separate

==Movement that followed==
Warner&#x27;s reform movement eventually formalized itself into the Church of God (Anderson), with unofficial headquarters in Anderson, Indiana, and began to behave like other denominations. To this day, this group—and others who have derived from it—refers to itself as a movement rather than a denomination and does not practice formal church membership. The movement grew numerically in such a degree that it became the fastest growing denomination in the USA during the first few decades of the 20th century. This was in spite of several defections and divisions.

===Zinzendorfism===
The first major defection from Warner&#x27;s movement occurred in the latter years of the 1890s. A large number of ministers and congregations left the movement over a disagreement on the doctrine of sanctification. This defection is generally known as &quot;The Anti-cleansing Heresy&quot; or Zinzendorfism by the followers of Warner. Those leaving were unable to unite into a unified group and soon were dispersed among other denominations.

===Faith and Victory movement===
About 1910, some concerned ministers and lay people began to speak up about &quot;worldliness&quot; creeping into the movement. The main issue was over the use of a neck-tie, which was considered as &quot;outward adornment&quot;. However, the concerns were broader than this one point, and included singing &quot;worldly songs&quot;, courtship practices, and using slang. Within a few years a small number of ministers, including C.E. Orr, Willis M. Brown, N.S. Duncan, and W.H. Shoot, began the &quot;Herald of Truth&quot; paper. Eventually, they would gather into what is now called the Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), which is characterized by its conservative holiness movement standards. The Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma) is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Faith and Victory&quot; people from the periodical with that name that was published for many years in Guthrie. Some of the dissenters later returned to the main group.

===7th-seal movement===
About 1940, some of the &quot;Anderson&quot; congregations began to express dissatisfaction with what they discerned to be &quot;drifting&quot; in the movement in areas such as mixed bathing between boys and girls, modesty, the entrance of the television into the home, the wearing of jewelry, and other practices that they considered to be at variance with what Daniel Warner had taught as Biblical truths. By the early 1940s, many ministers and congregations began to feel that the now existing headquarters and committees of the church were not addressing these concerns, and instead were &quot;compromising&quot; further the original message of Daniel Warner and the teachings of the Bible in order to gain fellowship with other denominations. Because of this, these individuals and congregations felt impressed of God to &quot;take their stand for truth&quot; and separate from the mainline movement.

It became the general consensus of the time that these following ministers were upset by the direction that C. E. Brown, editor of the Gospel Trumpet, was taking concerning a popular message of D. S. Warner, &quot;Come Out of Her My People.&quot; Brown believed that there were saved people in all churches and denominations; that indeed the &quot;Church of God&quot; was a much larger body than Warner&#x27;s movement. Brown also advocated theological training for ministers, which appeared to be a threat to those concerned with the &quot;drift.&quot; This situation with the &quot;7th-sealers&quot; mirrored an earlier historical event concerning Earl Slacum and the &quot;Watchmen Movement,&quot; which had created a schism. Slacum later felt he had erred, repented, and was restored to fellowship with the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana).
The dissenting congregations and individuals, including Charles Kline, Harold Barbor, N. Bogart, H. Pittman, John R. Crouch, R. Hines, G.W. Powell, H. Littek, E. Henry, Emerson Wilson, and H. Griffin, felt that they had received more light from God concerning the original eschatology of the movement. Based on this alleged &quot;light,&quot; these ministers began to teach that Daniel Warner had been a part of the sounding of the sixth trumpet of Revelation, but now the seventh trumpet was sounding, calling men once again from Babylon and sectarianism, which included the now allegedly apostatized Anderson movement in their view. In contrast, the majority of Warner&#x27;s movement felt that the 7th-seal message was a false teaching, with some even feeling that those churches associated with it used cult-like control of the followers. Likewise, the 7th-seal churches claimed they were following the original message that Daniel Warner preached, while others adamantly proclaimed that it was not so.

Since the 1940s, the 7th-seal movement has splintered into at least 6 documented schisms.

<text>Kraftwerk 2 is the second studio album by German electronic band Kraftwerk, released in January 1972.

==Background==
&quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot; was entirely written and performed by founding Kraftwerk members Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in late 1971, with the sessions produced by the influential Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank. Hütter later said of the album&#x27;s recording:

Perhaps the least characteristic album of their output, it features no synthesizers, the instrumentation being largely electric guitar, bass guitar, flute and violin. The electronics on display generally belong to the realm of 1960s tape-based music more usually produced in academia, with heavy use of tape echo (for example the massed looping flute layers of &quot;Strom&quot;), and reverse and altered speed tape effects.

The lengthy, almost side-long &quot;Klingklang&quot; which opens the album is notable for its use of a preset organ beatbox to provide the percussion track. It starts with a clangourous Stockhausen-like metallic percussion montage and gives rise to the unmistakable Kraftwerk sound. Later, the song title also became the name of the band&#x27;s own self-built studio, in Düsseldorf. &quot;Atem&quot; is a recording of breathing, while &quot;Harmonika&quot; features a tape-manipulated mouth organ.

The cover design, credited to Ralf and Florian, further hints at a deliberate association with conceptual art, being a repeat of the first album&#x27;s pop art design – except this time fluorescent green replaces the red and the number &#x27;2&#x27; is added.

It was eventually released in the UK, combined with the first Kraftwerk album as a double LP package, by the Vertigo label in March 1973, more than a year after its German release in January 1972.

No material from this album has been performed in the band&#x27;s live set since the Autobahn tour of 1975, and to date, the album has not been officially reissued. The band is seemingly reluctant to consider the album as a part of its canon; in later interviews, Schneider described the first three Kraftwerk albums as &quot;archaeology&quot;. However, unlicensed CDs of the album have been widely available since the mid-1990s on the Germanofon and Crown labels. Kraftwerk has hinted that the album may eventually see a re-mastered CD release after its &quot;Der Katalog&quot; boxed set.

<doc id="555313" wikidata="Q174380" url="?curid=555313" title="Manetho">
<text>Manetho (; &quot;Manéthōn&quot;, &quot;gen&quot;.: Μανέθωνος) is believed to have been an Egyptian priest from Sebennytos () who lived in the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the early third century BC, during the Hellenistic period. 

He authored the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (&quot;History of Egypt&quot;) in Greek, a major chronological source for the reigns of the kings of ancient Egypt. It is unclear whether he wrote his history and king list during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter or Ptolemy II Philadelphos, but it was completed no later than that of Ptolemy III Euergetes.

==Name==
The original Egyptian version of Manetho&#x27;s name is lost, but some speculate it means &quot;Truth of Thoth&quot;, &quot;Gift of Thoth&quot;, &quot;Beloved of Thoth&quot;, &quot;Beloved of Neith&quot;, or &quot;Lover of Neith&quot;. Less accepted proposals are &quot;Myinyu-heter&quot; (&quot;Horseherd&quot; or &quot;Groom&quot;) and &quot;Ma&#x27;ani-Djehuti&quot; (&quot;I have seen Thoth&quot;).

In the Greek language, the earliest fragments (the inscription of uncertain date on the base of a marble bust from the temple of Serapis at Carthage and the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus of the 1st century AD) wrote his name as Μανέθων &quot;Manethōn&quot;, so the Latinised rendering of his name here is given as Manetho. Other Greek renderings include &quot;Manethōs&quot;, &quot;Manethō&quot;, &quot;Manethos&quot;, &quot;Manēthōs&quot;, &quot;Manēthōn&quot;, and &quot;Manethōth&quot;. In Latin it is written as &quot;Manethon&quot;, &quot;Manethos&quot;, &quot;Manethonus&quot;, and &quot;Manetos&quot;.

==Life and work==
Although no sources for the dates of his life and death remain, Manetho is associated with the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323–283 BC) by Plutarch (c. 46–120 AD), while George Syncellus links Manetho directly with Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC).

If the mention of someone named Manetho in the Hibeh Papyri, dated to 241/240 BC, is in fact the celebrated author of the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, then Manetho may well have been working during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes (246–222 BC) as well, but at a very advanced age. Although the historicity of Manetho of Sebennytus was taken for granted by Josephus and later authors, the question as to whether he existed remains problematic. The Manetho of the Hibeh Papyri has no title and this letter deals with affairs in Upper Egypt not Lower Egypt, where our Manetho is thought to have functioned as a chief priest. The name Manetho is rare, but there is no reason &quot;a priori&quot; to presume that the Manetho of the &quot;Hibeh Papyri&quot; is the priest and historian from Sebennytus who is thought to have authored the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; for Ptolemy Philadelphus.

Manetho is described as a native Egyptian, and Egyptian would have been his mother tongue. Although the topics he supposedly wrote about dealt with Egyptian matters, he is said to have written exclusively in the Greek language for a Greek-speaking audience. Other literary works attributed to him include &quot;Against Herodotus&quot;, &quot;The Sacred Book&quot;, &quot;On Antiquity and Religion&quot;, &quot;On Festivals&quot;, &quot;On the Preparation of Kyphi&quot;, and the &quot;Digest of Physics&quot;. The treatise &quot;Book of Sothis&quot; has also been attributed to Manetho. These works are not attested during the Ptolemaic period when Manetho of Sebennytus is said to have lived and are only mentioned in another source in the first century AD, leaving a gap of 200–300 years between the composition of the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; and its first attestation. The gap is even larger for the other works attributed to Manetho such as &quot;The Sacred Book&quot; that is mentioned for the very first time by Eusebius in the fourth century AD.

Manetho of Sebennytus was probably a priest of the sun-god Ra at Heliopolis (according to George Syncellus, he was the chief priest). He was considered by Plutarch to be an authority on the cult of Serapis (a derivation of Osiris and Apis). Serapis was a Greco-Macedonian version of the Egyptian cult, probably started after Alexander the Great&#x27;s establishment of Alexandria in Egypt. A statue of the deity was imported in 286 BC by Ptolemy I Soter (or in 278 BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus) as Tacitus and Plutarch attest. There was also a tradition in antiquity that Timotheus of Athens (an authority on Demeter at Eleusis) directed the project together with Manetho, but the source of this information is not clear and it may originate from one of the literary works attributed to Manetho, in which case it has no independent value and does not corroborate the historicity of Manetho the priest-historian of the early third century BC.

==&quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;==
The &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (, &quot;Aigyptiaka&quot;), the &quot;History of Egypt&quot;, may have been Manetho&#x27;s largest work, and certainly the most important. It was organised chronologically and divided into three volumes. His division of rulers into dynasties was an innovation. However, he did not use the term in the modern sense, by bloodlines, but rather, introduced new dynasties whenever he detected some sort of discontinuity, whether geographical (Dynasty Four from Memphis, Dynasty Five from Elephantine), or genealogical (especially in Dynasty One, he refers to each successive king as the &quot;son&quot; of the previous to define what he means by &quot;continuity&quot;). Within the superstructure of a genealogical table, he fills in the gaps with substantial narratives of the kings.

Some have suggested that &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; was written as a competing account to Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories,&quot; to provide a national history for Egypt that did not exist before. From this perspective, &quot;Against Herodotus&quot; may have been an abridged version or just a part of &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; that circulated independently. Neither survives in its original form today.

Two English translations of the fragments of Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; have been published: by William Gillan Waddell in 1940, and by Gerald P. Verbrugghe and John Moore Wickersham in 2001.

=== Transmission and reception ===

Despite the reliance of Egyptologists on him for their reconstructions of the Egyptian dynasties, the problem with a close study of Manetho is that not only was &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; not preserved as a whole, but it also became involved in a rivalry among advocates of Egyptian, Jewish, and Greek histories in the form of supporting polemics. During this period, disputes raged concerning the oldest civilizations, and so Manetho&#x27;s account was probably excerpted during this time for use in this argument with significant alterations. Material similar to Manetho&#x27;s has been found in Lysimachus of Alexandria, a brother of Philo, and it has been suggested that this was inserted into Manetho. We do not know when this might have occurred, but scholars specify a at the first century AD, when Josephus began writing.

The earliest surviving attestation to Manetho is that of &quot;Contra Apionem&quot; (&quot;Against Apion&quot;) by Flavius Josephus, nearly four centuries after &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; was composed. Even here, it is clear that Josephus did not have the originals, and constructed a polemic against Manetho without them. Avaris and Osarseph are both mentioned twice (1.78, 86–87; 238, 250). &quot;Apion&quot; 1.95–97 is merely a list of kings with no narratives until 1.98, while running across two of Manetho&#x27;s dynasties without mention (dynasties eighteen and nineteen).

Contemporaneously or perhaps after Josephus wrote, an epitome of Manetho&#x27;s work must have been circulated. This would have involved preserving the outlines of his dynasties and a few details deemed significant. For the first ruler of the first dynasty, Menes, we learn that &quot;he was snatched and killed by a hippopotamus&quot;. The extent to which the epitome preserved Manetho&#x27;s original writing is unclear, so caution must be exercised. Nevertheless, the epitome was preserved by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Caesarea. Because Africanus predates Eusebius, his version is usually considered more reliable, but there is no assurance that this is the case. Eusebius in turn was preserved by Jerome in his Latin translation, an Armenian translation, and by George Syncellus. Syncellus recognized the similarities between Eusebius and Africanus, so he placed them side by side in his work, &quot;Ecloga Chronographica&quot;.

Africanus, Syncellus, and the Latin and Armenian translations of Eusebius are what remains of the epitome of Manetho. Other significant fragments include Malalas&#x27;s &quot;Chronographia&quot; and the &quot;Excerpta Latina Barbari&quot;, a bad translation of a Greek chronology.

===Sources and methods===
Manetho&#x27;s methods involved the use of king-lists to provide a structure for his history. There were precedents to his writing available in Egypt (plenty of which have survived to this day), and his Hellenistic and Egyptian background would have been influential in his writing. Josephus records him admitting to using &quot;nameless oral tradition&quot; (1.105) and &quot;myths and legends&quot; (1.229) for his account, and there is no reason to doubt this, as admissions of this type were common among historians of that era. His familiarity with Egyptian legends is indisputable, but how he learned Greek legends is more open to debate. He must have been familiar with Herodotus, and in some cases, he even attempted to synchronize Egyptian history with Greek (for example, equating King Memnon with Amenophis, and Armesis with Danaos). This suggests he was also familiar with the Greek Epic Cycle (for which the Ethiopian Memnon is slain by Achilles during the Trojan War) and the history of Argos (in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Suppliants&quot;). However, it has also been suggested that these were later interpolations, particularly when the epitome was being written, so these guesses are at best tentative.

====King lists====
At the behest of Ptolemy Philadelphus (266–228 BC), Manetho copied down a list of eight successive Persian kings, beginning with Cambyses, the son of Cyrus the Great. Manetho&#x27;s record of regnal years for these kings is mostly corroborated by Ptolemy of Alexandria in his &quot;Canon&quot;, excepting for the fact that Artabanus who reigned for only 7 months is omitted by Ptolemy, while Ptolemy puts 8 years (instead of 5) for Cambyses&#x27; reign.
:Cambyses (Artaxerxes) b. Cyrus = reigned over Persia, his own kingdom, for 5 years, and over Egypt for 6 years.
:Darius (II), the son of Hystaspes = reigned 36 years.
:Xerxes (Artaxerxes), the Great, b. Darius = reigned 21 years.
:Artabanus = reigned 7 months.
:Artaxerxes (Cyrus) b. Xerxes the Great = reigned 41 years.
:Xerxes = reigned 2 months.
:Sogdianus = reigned 7 months.
:Darius (III), the son of Xerxes = reigned 19 years.

Between Cambyses&#x27; reign and Darius, the son of Hystaspes, there was an interim period whereby the Magi ruled over Persia. This important anecdote is supplied by Herodotus who wrote the Magian ruled Persia for 7 months after the death of Cambyses. Josephus, on the other hand, says they obtained the government of the Persians for a year.

The king-list that Manetho had access to is unknown to us, but of the surviving king-lists, the one most similar to his is the Turin Royal Canon (or &quot;Turin Papyrus&quot;). The oldest source with which we can compare to Manetho are the &quot;Old Kingdom Annals&quot; (c. 2500-2200 BC). From the New Kingdom are the list at Karnak (constructed by order of Thutmose III), two at Abydos (by Seti I and Ramesses II— the latter a duplicate, but updated version of the former), and the Saqqara list by the priest Tenry.

The provenance of the &quot;Old Kingdom Annals&quot; is unknown, surviving as the Palermo Stone. The differences between the &quot;Annals&quot; and Manetho are great. The &quot;Annals&quot; only reach to the fifth dynasty, but its pre-dynastic rulers are listed as the kings of Lower Egypt and kings of Upper Egypt. By contrast, Manetho lists several Greek and Egyptian deities beginning with Hephaistos and Helios. Secondly, the &quot;Annals&quot; give annual reports of the activities of the kings, while there is little probability that Manetho would have been able to go into such detail.

The New Kingdom lists are each selective in their listings: that of Seti I, for instance, lists seventy-six kings from dynasties one to nineteen, omitting the Hyksos rulers and those associated with the heretic Akhenaten. The Saqqara king list, contemporaneous with Ramesses II, has fifty-eight names, with similar omissions. If Manetho used these lists at all, he would have been unable to get all of his information from them alone, due to the selective nature of their records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham argue:

These large &quot;stelae&quot; stand in contrast to the Turin Royal Canon (such as Saqqara, contemporaneous with Ramesses II), written in hieratic script. Like Manetho, it begins with the deities, and seems to be an epitome very similar in spirit and style to Manetho. Interestingly, the opposite side of the papyrus includes government records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham suggest that a comprehensive list such as this would be necessary for a government office &quot;to date contracts, leases, debts, titles, and other instruments (2000:106)&quot; and so could not have been selective in the way the king-lists in temples were. Despite numerous differences between the Turin Canon and Manetho, the format must have been available to him. As a priest (or chief priest), he would have had access to practically all written materials in the temple.

While the precise origins for Manetho&#x27;s king-list are unknown, it was certainly a northern, Lower Egyptian one. This can be deduced most noticeably from his selection of the kings for the Third Intermediate Period. Manetho consistently includes the Tanite Dynasty Twenty-one and Dynasty Twenty-two lineage in his &quot;Epitome&quot; such as Psusennes I, Amenemope and even such short-lived kings as Amenemnisu (five years) and Osochor (six years). In contrast, he ignores the existence of Theban kings such as Osorkon III, Takelot III, Harsiese A, Pinedjem I, and kings from Middle Egypt such as Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis. This implies that Manetho derived the primary sources for his &quot;Epitome&quot; from a local city&#x27;s temple library in the region of the River Nile Delta which was controlled by the Tanite-based Dynasty Twenty-one and Dynasty Twenty-two kings. The Middle and Upper Egyptian kings did not have any effect upon this specific region of the delta; hence their exclusion from Manetho&#x27;s king-list.

====Transcriptions of Pharaonic names====
By the Middle Kingdom, Egyptian kings each had five different names, the &quot;Horus&quot; name; the &quot;Two Ladies&quot; name; the &quot;Gold Horus&quot; name; the &quot;praenomen&quot; or &quot;throne name&quot;; and a &quot;nomen&quot;, the personal name given at birth (also called a &quot;Son of Ra&quot; name as it was preceded by &quot;Sa Re″&quot;). Some kings also had multiple examples within these names, such as Ramesses II who used six Horus names at various times. Because Manetho&#x27;s transcriptions agree with many king-lists, it is generally accepted that he was reliant on one or more such lists, and it is not clear to what extent he was aware of the different pharaonic names of rulers long past (and he had alternate names for some). Not all of the different names for each king have been uncovered.

Manetho did not choose consistently from the five different types of names, but in some cases, a straightforward transcription is possible. Egyptian &quot;Men&quot; or &quot;Meni&quot; (Son of Ra and king-list names) becomes &quot;Menes&quot; (officially, this is Pharaoh I.1 Narmer—&quot;I&quot; represents Dynasty I, and &quot;1&quot; means the first king of that dynasty), while &quot;Menkauhor&quot;/&quot;Menkahor&quot; (Throne and king-list names, the Horus names is &quot;Menkhau&quot; and the Son of Ra name is &quot;Kaiu Horkaiu[...]&quot;) is transcribed as &quot;Menkheres&quot; (V.7 Menkauhor). Others involve a slight abbreviation, such as &quot;A&#x27;akheperen-Re″&quot; (Throne and king-list names) becoming &quot;Khebron&quot; (XVIII.4 Thutmose II). A few more have consonants switched for unknown reasons, as for example &quot;Tausret&quot; becoming &quot;Thouoris&quot; (XIX.6 Twosre/Tausret). One puzzle is in the conflicting names of some early dynastic kings— although they did not have all five titles, they still had multiple names. I.3/4 Djer, whose Son of Ra name is &quot;Itti&quot; is considered the basis for Manetho&#x27;s I.2 Athothis. I.4 Oenephes then is a puzzle unless it is compared with Djer&#x27;s Gold Horus name, &quot;Ennebu&quot;. It may be that Manetho duplicated the name or he had a source for a name unknown to us. Finally, there are some names where the association is a complete mystery to us. V.6 Rhathoures/Niuserre&#x27;s complete name was &quot;Set-ib-tawi Set-ib-Nebty Netjeri-bik-nebu Ni-user-Re&#x27; Ini Ni-user-Re″&quot;, but Manetho writes it as Rhathoures. It may be that some kings were known by names other than even just the five official ones.

Thus, how Manetho transcribed these names varies, and as such, we cannot reconstruct the original Egyptian forms of the names. However, because of the simplicity with which Manetho transcribed long names (see above), they were preferred until original king-lists began to be uncovered in Egyptian sites, translated, and corroborated. Manetho&#x27;s division of dynasties, however, is still used as a basis for all Egyptian discussions.

===Content===
Volume 1 begins from the earliest times, listing deities and demigods as kings of Egypt. Stories of Isis, Osiris, Set, or Horus might have been found here. Manetho does not transliterate either, but gives the Greek equivalent deities by a convention that predates him: (Egyptian) Ptah = (Greek) Hephaistos; Isis = Demeter; Thoth = Hermes; Horus = Apollo; Seth = Typhon; etc. This is one of the clues as to how syncretism developed between seemingly disparate religions. He then proceeds to Dynastic Egypt, from Dynasty One to Eleven. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom.

Volume 2 covers Dynasties Twelve–Nineteen, which includes the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (Fifteen–Seventeen—the Hyksos invasion), and then their expulsion and the establishment of the New Kingdom (Eighteen onward). The Second Intermediate Period was of particular interest to Josephus, where he equated the Hyksos or &quot;shepherd-kings&quot; as the ancient Israelites who eventually made their way out of Egypt (&quot;Apion&quot; 1.82–92). He even includes a brief etymological discussion of the term &quot;Hyksos&quot;.

Volume 3 continues with Dynasty Twenty and concludes with Dynasty Thirty (or Thirty-one, see below). The Saite Renaissance occurs in Dynasty Twenty-six, while Dynasty Twenty-seven involves the Achaemenid interruption of Egyptian rule. Three more local dynasties are mentioned, although they must have overlapped with Persian rule. Dynasty Thirty-one consisted of three Persian rulers, and some have suggested that this was added by a continuator. Both Moses of Chorene and Jerome end at Nectanebo II (&quot;last king of the Egyptians&quot; and &quot;destruction of the Egyptian monarchy&quot; respectively), but Dynasty Thirty-one fits within Manetho&#x27;s schemata of demonstrating power through the &quot;dynasteia&quot; well. The Thirty-second dynasty would have been the Ptolemies.

===Similarities with Berossos===
Most of the ancient witnesses group Manetho together with Berossos, and treat the pair as similar in intent, and it is not a coincidence that those who preserved the bulk of their writing are largely the same (Josephus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus). Certainly, both wrote about the same time, and both adopted the historiographical approach of the Greek writers Herodotus and Hesiod, who preceded them. While the subjects of their history are different, the form is similar, using chronological royal genealogies as the structure for the narratives. Both extend their histories far into the mythic past, to give the deities rule over the earliest ancestral histories.

Syncellus goes so far as to insinuate that the two copied each other:

While this does seem an incredible coincidence, the reliability of the report is unclear. The reasoning for presuming they started their histories in the same year involved some considerable contortions. Berossos dated the period before the Flood to 120 &quot;saroi&quot; (3,600 year periods), giving an estimate of 432,000 years before the Flood. This was unacceptable to later Christian commentators, so it was presumed he meant solar days. 432,000 divided by 365 days gives a rough figure of years before the Flood. For Manetho, even more numeric contortions ensued. With no flood mentioned, they presumed that Manetho&#x27;s first era describing the deities represented the ante-diluvian age. Secondly, they took the spurious &quot;Book of Sothis&quot; for a chronological count. Six dynasties of deities totalled 11,985 years, while the nine dynasties with demigods came to 858 years. Again, this was too long for the Biblical account, so two different units of conversion were used. The 11,985 years were considered to be months of days each (a conversion used in antiquity, for example by Diodorus Siculus), which comes out to 969 years. The latter period, however, was divided into seasons, or quarters of a year, and reduces to years (another conversion attested to by Diodorus). The sum of these comes out to years, equal to that of Berossos. Syncellus rejected both Manetho&#x27;s and Berossos&#x27; incredible time-spans, as well as the efforts of other commentators to harmonise their numbers with the Bible. Ironically as we see, he also blamed them for the synchronicity concocted by later writers.

===Effect of &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;===
It is speculated that Manetho wrote at the request of Ptolemy I or Ptolemy II to give an account of the history of Egypt to the Greeks from a native perspective. However, there is no evidence for this hypothesis. If such were the case, &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; was a failure, since Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; continued to provide the standard account in the Hellenistic world. It may also have been that some nationalistic sentiments in Manetho provided the impetus for his writing, but that again is a conjecture. It is clear, however, that when it was written, it would have proven to be the authoritative account of the history of Egypt, superior to Herodotus in every way. The completeness and systematic nature in which he collected his sources was unprecedented.

Syncellus similarly recognised its importance when recording Eusebius and Africanus, and even provided a separate witness from the &quot;Book of Sothis&quot;. Unfortunately, this material is likely to have been a forgery or hoax of unknown date. Every king in &quot;Sothis&quot; after Menes is irreconcilable with the versions of Africanus and Eusebius. Manetho should not be judged on the factuality of his account, but on the method he used to record history, and in this, he was as successful as Herodotus and Hesiod.

Finally, in modern times, the effect is still visible in the way Egyptologists divide the dynasties of the Egyptian kings. The French explorer and Egyptologist Jean-François Champollion reportedly held a copy of Manetho&#x27;s lists in one hand as he attempted to decipher the hieroglyphs he encountered. Most modern scholarship that mentions the names of the kings will render both the modern transcription and Manetho&#x27;s version, and in some cases Manetho&#x27;s names are even preferred to more authentic ones. Today, his division of dynasties is used universally, and this has permeated the study of nearly all royal genealogies by the conceptualization of succession in terms of dynasties or houses.

Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; has been cited as a source for early antisemitic ideas because of his account of Exodus, in which he portrays the Jewish people as forming from a group of lepers and shepherds who were expelled from Egypt and later conquered it, was repeated by later ancient authors such as Posidonius of Apamea, Lysimachus, Chaeremon, Apion, and Tacitus. It is likely, though, that these ideas were current at the time, rather than being inventions of Manetho specifically.

<text>Kraftwerk is the debut studio album by German electronic band Kraftwerk. It was released in Germany in 1970, and produced by Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank.

==Recording==
The album was recorded from July to September 1970. Chief Kraftwerk members Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider used two drummers during the recording of the album; Andreas Hohmann and Klaus Dinger. Dinger played on &quot;Vom Himmel Hoch&quot;, while Hohmann played on &quot;Ruckzuck&quot;, and &quot;Stratovarius&quot;, however, these last ones were completed before Dinger joined the sessions.

The other instrumentation features Hütter on bass and Hammond and Tubon electric organs, the latter was made by Swedish factory Joh Mustad AB in 1966, whilst Schneider supplied flute. The song &quot;Ruckzuck&quot; is driven by a powerful multi-dubbed flute riff, along with electric violin and guitar; these instruments often connected to further electronics via an Electronic Music Studios pitch-to-voltage converter. &quot;Vom Himmel Hoch&quot; has slight pitch curves that emulate the Doppler effect. The artwork featured a fluorescent-coloured traffic cone drawn.

==Release==
&quot;Kraftwerk&quot; was released in November 1970. In early 1971, Hutter left the group and Schneider was left alone with drummer Dinger and newcomer guitarist Michael Rother. The 3-member Kraftwerk line up of Schneider, Dinger and Michael Rother made an appearance on Radio Bremen, and also on the TV shows &quot;Beat-Club&quot; and &quot;Okidoki&quot;. After this, Dinger and Rother left to form revered band Neu!, with Hütter rejoining Schneider to continue Kraftwerk and both parties recording under the mentoring of Conny Plank.

No material from this album has been performed in the band&#x27;s live set since the &quot;Autobahn&quot; tour of 1975 and, to date, the album has not been officially issued on compact disc. The band are seemingly reluctant to consider the album a part of their canon and in later interviews, Schneider referred to the first three Kraftwerk albums as &quot;archaeology&quot;. However, unlicensed CD and vinyl pressings of the album have been widely available since the mid-1990s on the Germanofon and Crown labels. Kraftwerk has hinted that the album may finally see a re-mastered CD release after &quot;Der Katalog&quot; boxed set.

== Use in media ==
&quot;Ruckzuck&quot; was used as the theme song for the PBS show &quot;Newton&#x27;s Apple&quot; in the United States.

Lindholm&#x27;s writing includes the urban fantasy novel &quot;Wizard of the Pigeons&quot; and science fiction short stories, among other works. , her fiction has been translated into 22 languages and sold more than 4 million copies.

Born in California, Lindholm grew up in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest and married a mariner at age 18. The Alaskan wilderness and the ocean were prominent aspects of her life, influencing her writing. After an early career in short fiction, at age 30, Lindholm published her first novel while working as a waitress and raising children. The first work to bring her recognition was the 1986 novel &quot;Wizard of the Pigeons&quot;, a liminal fantasy set in Seattle. A forerunner of the urban fantasy genre, it received praise for Lindholm&#x27;s depiction of understated magic and poverty. Her science fiction novella &quot;A Touch of Lavender&quot; was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula Awards. While critically well received, Lindholm&#x27;s work did not sell well; she began writing under the pen name Robin Hobb in 1995.

Hobb achieved commercial success with her debut work under this pseudonym, the &quot;Farseer&quot; trilogy. An epic fantasy told as a first-person retrospective, it has been described as a character-driven and introspective work. Hobb went on to write four further series set in the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot;, which received praise from critics for her characterization, and in 2005 &quot;The Times&quot; described her as &quot;one of the great modern fantasy writers&quot;. Through her writing, Hobb explores otherness, ecocentrism, queerness, and gender as themes. She concluded the &quot;Elderlings&quot; series in 2017 and won the World Fantasy Award—Life Achievement in 2021.

== Early life ==
Margaret Astrid Lindholm was born in Berkeley, California, in 1952; from the age of 10, she grew up in Fairbanks, Alaska. She recalls growing up in the middle of an oil boom in Alaska, which led to a rapid growth in population of the rural town she lived in. A shortage of classroom space caused some of her high school classes to be held in staircases. Lindholm did not like how the town&#x27;s urbanization intruded on the nature trails around her house, which she had enjoyed exploring, but said her childhood was overall a happy one and described herself as more of a solitary than social child. Her family raised a half wolf called Bruno and hunted caribou and moose; this would later inspire the wolf character Nighteyes and the descriptions of wilderness survival in Lindholm&#x27;s writing. After graduating from Lathrop High School, she studied at the University of Denver for a year before returning to Alaska.

At 18, Lindholm married Fred Ogden, a merchant mariner; they had been dating for a year. The couple moved to Hawaii; they lived there for more than a year, but found it too hot to acclimate to and returned to Fred&#x27;s hometown of Kodiak, located at the tip of Kodiak Island in south-central Alaska. Margaret enjoyed journeying on Fred&#x27;s ships and said the sea was a prominent aspect of her life, inspiring the maritime focus of her &quot;Liveship&quot; books. She published her first novel at age 30, while working as a waitress; she balanced between writing and caring for her four children while her husband worked offshore as a commercial fisherman. The family experienced financial difficulties at the time and said their income &quot;depended entirely on fish and editors&quot;. Margaret described her writing process as: &quot;writing fits into odd corners. It&#x27;s during the naptime, it&#x27;s sitting by the bath tub writing, it&#x27;s writing after the children are in bed&quot;. She also worked part-time, including in waitressing and mail delivery, early in her career.

== Writing career ==
Hobb&#x27;s work has appeared under several pen names: as M. Lindholm and Megan Lindholm from 1979, and as Robin Hobb from 1995. The change from Margaret, her first name, to Megan was due to a misunderstanding with her first editor. Megan Lindholm&#x27;s writing received critical praise, including Hugo and Nebula Award nominations for her short fiction, but did not sell well. In 1995, the author started writing in a new fantasy subgenre and deliberately chose an androgynous pen name, Robin Hobb, for her new work written as a first-person male narrator. Her writing as Hobb was commercially successful, and has appeared on New York Times bestseller lists. She continues to write under both Hobb and Lindholm bylines.

=== As Megan Lindholm ===
Lindholm sold her first short story to a children&#x27;s magazine, leading to an early career writing for children. Her short fiction for children appeared in magazines such as &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, and &quot;Highlights for Children&quot;. She also composed educational material, short works of fiction created to a very specific vocabulary list, which were used in SRA&#x27;s programmed reading material.

In the 1970s, Lindholm also began to write short fantasy, publishing short stories in fanzines such as &quot;Space and Time&quot; (edited by Gordon Linzner). Her first professional sale as a fantasy writer was the short story &quot;Bones for Dulath&quot;, which appeared in the 1979 &quot;Amazons!&quot; anthology, and which introduced her recurring characters Ki and Vandien. The anthology, published by DAW Books, won a World Fantasy Award for Year&#x27;s Best Anthology. A second story featuring Ki and Vandien, &quot;The Small One,&quot; was published in &quot;Fantastic Stories&quot; in 1980.

Until 1995, she continued to publish exclusively under the name Megan Lindholm. Her fiction under that name spans several slices of the fantasy genre, from fantasy adventure (the Ki and Vandien tales) to urban fantasy. Her 1986 novel &quot;Wizard of the Pigeons&quot; was one of the precursors of the urban fantasy genre, and was the first work to bring her wider attention.

Lindholm&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Harpy&#x27;s Flight&quot;, was published by Ace in 1983. It was the first of four novels about the characters Ki and Vandien, the last of which was published in 1989. She contributed short stories to a shared world anthology entitled &quot;Liavek&quot; from 1985 to 1988, and co-wrote a novel, &quot;The Gypsy&quot;, with Steven Brust. &quot;The Gypsy&quot; was released both as a traditional paper book and as part of an enhanced multimedia CD which included the text of the novel as well as the Boiled in Lead album &quot;Songs From the Gypsy&quot;, which was considered the soundtrack to the novel and featured songs written by Brust and his Cats Laughing bandmate Adam Stemple which had inspired the creation of both the novel and the album.

She has continued to publish short stories as Megan Lindholm, including an appearance in the 2013 anthology &quot;Year&#x27;s Best SF 18&quot;.

=== As Robin Hobb ===
Robin Hobb, a pseudonym that Lindholm has used for writing works of epic traditional fantasy, first appeared in 1995. Her writing has mainly focused on the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot;, a series of 16 books written in five parts. The series comprises four trilogies and one tetralogythe &quot;Farseer&quot;, the &quot;Liveship Traders&quot;, the &quot;Tawny Man&quot;, the &quot;Rain Wild&quot;, and the &quot;Fitz and the Fool&quot; set in the same world.

Hobb&#x27;s first work was the &quot;Farseer&quot; trilogy, narrated in first person by FitzChivalry Farseer, illegitimate son of a prince, and featuring an enigmatic character called the Fool. The first volume of the trilogy, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, was published in 1995, followed by &quot;Royal Assassin&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Quest&quot; in 1997. Hobb next wrote a nautical fantasy series, the &quot;Liveship Traders&quot;, set in a different part of the &quot;Elderlings&quot; world and featuring pirates, sea serpents, a family of traders and their living ships. The books of the trilogy, &quot;Ship of Magic&quot;, &quot;The Mad Ship&quot; and &quot;Ship of Destiny&quot;, were published between 1998 and 2000. Over the following three years, Hobb returned to the first-person narrative of Fitz in the &quot;Tawny Man&quot; trilogy, set after the events of the &quot;Liveship&quot; novels and comprising &quot;Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot;, &quot;The Golden Fool&quot;, and &quot;Fool&#x27;s Fate&quot;. As of 2003, Robin Hobb had sold over one million copies of her first nine novels, which formed three trilogies set in the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot;.

The three books of the &quot;Soldier Son&quot; trilogy (&quot;Shaman&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, &quot;Forest Mage&quot;, and &quot;Renegade&#x27;s Magic&quot;) are Hobb&#x27;s only works to be set outside of the &quot;Elderlings&quot; world; the books were published between 2005 and 2009. In addition, &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, published in 2011, was a collection of short stories written both as Robin Hobb and as Megan Lindholm.

From 2009 to 2013, Hobb released the four novels of the &quot;Rain Wild Chronicles&quot; (&quot;Dragon Keeper&quot;, &quot;Dragon Haven&quot;, &quot;City of Dragons&quot; and &quot;Blood of Dragons&quot;). This series is set in the same world, the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot;, as Hobb&#x27;s earlier trilogies. In 2014, Hobb resumed the story, decades later in life, of her two most popular characters in the &quot;Fitz and the Fool&quot; trilogy, with its three volumes, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Assassin&quot;, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Fate&quot;, published from 2014 to 2017. The last novel, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Fate&quot;, concludes not only her earlier books featuring Fitz, but also the &quot;Liveship&quot; and &quot;Rain Wild&quot; books.

In 2022, she protested against the eviction of Stéphanie Nicot from the festival Les imaginales by publishing a letter of support for Nicot with other authors among whom Floriane Soulas, Sylvie Lainé, Ïan Larue, Estelle Faye, Sara Doke, Sylvie Denis, Lucie Chenu, , and .

== Style and themes ==

=== Genre and style ===
Hobb&#x27;s writing spans the speculative fiction genre. Her most famous work, the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot;, is secondary-world fantasy, with the &quot;Farseer&quot; novels narrated as first-person retrospective. This has been described as an unusual approach in fantasy, with greater focus on the characters&#x27; internal conflicts over the external. Her earlier writing as Megan Lindholm comprises short-form science fiction and urban fantasy. Her 1986 novel &quot;Wizard of the Pigeons&quot; has been cited as a forerunner of the urban fantasy genre, with scholar Farah Mendlesohn describing it as liminal fantasy that pairs &quot;plain descriptions of the fantastic [...] with baroque descriptions of the real&quot;. Hobb herself has said that she employs different voices for the two pseudonyms, with Lindholm&#x27;s voice &quot;a little more snarky, a little more sarcastic, a little less optimistic, less emotional&quot;, and more attuned to dark, urban fantasy.

Hobb&#x27;s novels have sometimes been compared to fellow author George R. R. Martin, with both their best-known works published during the 1990s. While Martin and Hobb&#x27;s series are considered more realistic than most epic fantasy, they differ in how they depict said realism. According to scholar Sylvia Borowska-Szerszun, Martin&#x27;s work focuses on the brutality and violence of its realism, while Hobb&#x27;s narrative focuses more on the individual, and is interested in exploring psychological aspects of trauma.
Critic Amanda Craig describes Hobb&#x27;s writing as having a Shakespearean flavor, and calls the mood &quot;nothing like as bleak as George R R Martin&#x27;s, nor as Manichean as Tolkien&#x27;s, but close to Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s redemptive humanism&quot;.

Literary allusions to the works of Robert Louis Stevenson and R. M. Ballantyne have been identified in Hobb&#x27;s &quot;Liveship Traders&quot; series, which academics Ralph Crane and Lisa Fletcher described as an immersive portrayal of a world that is water-centric, aided by unique perspectives such as a serpent&#x27;s-eye view of the ocean (the serpents view the sea as &quot;the Plenty&quot;, while the air above is termed &quot;the Lack&quot;). The larger map of the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot; has been recognized as resembling the U.S. state of Alaska, where Hobb grew up. Scholar Geoffrey B. Elliott views the setting of the &quot;Tawny Man&quot; trilogy as drawing from the geography and indigenous culture of the Pacific Northwest, noting the glacier-filled isles and matrilineal culture of Hobb&#x27;s Out Islands.

=== Themes ===
Tolerance for otherness is a theme that runs through the fantasy elements of Hobb&#x27;s &quot;Elderlings&quot; series. The books feature two kinds of magic: the socially acceptable Skill, practiced by the ruling class, and the despised Wit, relegated with the lower classes. The Wit, the ability to bond with animals, is viewed as an unnatural inclination, as emasculating and shameful, with its practitioners publicly hanged and forced into hiding. Scholars have described it as an allegory for queerness and homophobia. The protagonist Fitz, who is both Skilled and Witted, leads conflicting identities. His bond with his Witted partner, a wolf, is portrayed as central to his life as his human relationships, but is forced to operate in secret due to social prejudice. This personal struggle, as well as the larger struggle for de-ostracization of the Witted, form a key theme of the series.

Hobb explores gender as a theme in the &quot;Liveship Traders&quot;, which focuses on the lives of three generations of women in a patriarchal society. The women of the series often defy stereotypical expectations of their femininity: Althea, a rebellious sailor who dresses as a man to work on a ship, re-kindles her sensitive side; Keffria, a submissive housewife, discovers her independence; and Ronica, a conservative, traditional matriarch adapts to social change. The Fool, an enigmatic character whose gender identity shifts through the series, appears as a young woman in some sections and as a man in others. Scholars have described this depiction of gender as subversive, and as challenging the notion of a rigid boundary between genders.

Ecological themes have also been identified in Hobb&#x27;s work. The resurgence of dragons in the &quot;Elderlings&quot; series poses a challenge to anthropocentrism, or the supremacy of man&#x27;s place in the world, with humans forced to re-adjust in relation to a stronger, more intelligent predator. The Wit, an ill-regarded ability associated with the animal world, is shown through Fitz&#x27;s perspective as a natural extension of the senses and as an interconnectedness to all living things. Scholar Mariah Larsson view the series as ecocentric in nature, questioning the intrinsic value of human over other forms of life.

Other themes in Hobb&#x27;s writing include critiques of colonialism and examination of culture-specific honor systems in the &quot;Soldier Son&quot; trilogy, a series set in a post-colonial secondary world that has drawn resemblance to the 19th century American frontier.

== Reception ==
Lindholm&#x27;s work did not sell well, causing her to remain a midlist author for several years. Her works as Hobb have been commercially successful: the first three sub-series of the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot; had sold more than a million copies by 2003, and at the time of the series&#x27; conclusion in 2017, more than 1.25 million copies had been sold in the UK alone. , Hobb&#x27;s fiction has been translated into 22 languages and sold more than 4 million copies in France. Following her success as Hobb, her Lindholm works such as &quot;Wizard of the Pigeons&quot; and &quot;Alien Earth&quot; were translated to French, and &quot;Cloven Hooves&quot;, which had been out of print for more than two decades, was reprinted in the US.

Hobb has received recognition for her characterization. In a column for &quot;The Times&quot;, critic Amanda Craig called Hobb &quot;one of the great modern fantasy writers&quot;. She described Hobb&#x27;s characters as believable people who &quot;age, change, waver and suffer lasting scars&quot;, and highlighted the portrayal of Fitz, the protagonist of the &quot;Farseer&quot; trilogy. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; remarked on the &quot;striking portraits of three generations of women&quot; in the sequel &quot;Liveship Traders&quot; trilogy, and stated that though Hobb&#x27;s works had a medieval setting, her themes resonated in the modern world. In a review of the first book of the &quot;Fitz and the Fool&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said of her characters that &quot;their longings and failings are our own, and we find our view of the world indelibly changed by their experiences&quot;. Comparing her writing with that of literary novelists, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described Hobb&#x27;s novels as transcending the fantasy genre. The &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; found Hobb&#x27;s characters in the final trilogy interesting even in middle age, writing that traumas experienced in childhood &quot;linger and take on new shapes&quot; as her characters aged. The &quot;LARB&quot; described the psychological complexity of Hobb&#x27;s characters, along with the layered interactions between them, as central to the appeal of her writing. In a similar view, &quot;Library Journal&quot; described the &quot;Elderlings&quot; series as &quot;masterworks of character-based epic fantasy&quot;.

Some of Hobb&#x27;s works have received less positive a reception: &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized the &quot;Soldier Son&quot; books as lacking the &quot;heart and page-turning spark&quot; of her Fitz novels, and viewed the &quot;Rain Wild&quot; novels as &quot;flimsy in comparison&quot;. Scholar Lenise Prater positively viewed how Hobb&#x27;s &quot;Elderlings&quot; novels blurred gender boundaries; she however critiqued Hobb&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;monogamous, romantic love&quot;, viewing it as heteronormative and as a conservative representation of queer relationships. A different view was offered by scholar Peter Melville, who described the final &quot;Elderlings&quot; trilogy as &quot;confirm[ing] the series&#x27; place within the larger history of queerness in the fantasy genre&quot;.

As Megan Lindholm, she has received praise for the depiction of understated magic, poverty and mental illness in the novel &quot;Wizard of the Pigeons&quot; and other themes such as aging in her short fiction. Other aspects of Hobb&#x27;s writing that have drawn commentary include her prose, described by &quot;The Times&quot; as having &quot;a sinewy simplicity close to that of myths and fairytales&quot;, her portrayal of gender, in particular the gender-fluid character known as the Fool, and her depiction of psychological aspects of trauma, including that arising from violence and rape.
Fellow authors of speculative fiction have praised Hobb&#x27;s work. Orson Scott Card stated that she &quot;arguably set the standard for the modern serious fantasy novel&quot;, and cited the &quot;Liveship Traders&quot; as his favorite work of Hobb&#x27;s. George R.R. Martin has praised her work, writing that her books are like &quot;diamonds in a sea of zircons&quot;. In 2014, Hobb was a Guest of Honor at the 72nd World Science Fiction Convention in London.

== Awards ==
In 1981, Megan Lindholm was awarded an Alaska State Council of the Arts prize for her short story &quot;The Poaching&quot;. As Megan Lindholm, her short fiction works have been finalists for both the Nebula and the Hugo awards, and winner of the Asimov&#x27;s Readers Award. In 2021, Lindholm won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, presented to individuals who have demonstrated outstanding service to the fantasy field.

== Personal life ==
She currently publishes under both her pen names, and lives on a small farm outside of Roy, Washington. 

Robin still frequently drives to the University Book Store in Seattle to autograph books for fans. She contracted COVID-19 in February 2023.

<doc id="555333" wikidata="Q1746795" url="?curid=555333" title="Irfan Pathan">
<text>Irfan Pathan (; born 27 October 1984) is an Indian cricket commentator, analyst and former player. He was a bowling all-rounder and member of the Indian cricket team that won the inaugural 2007 ICC Twenty20 World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.

Beginning his career as a fast-medium swing and seam bowler, Pathan broke into the national team soon after turning 19, and evoked comparisons with Pakistan&#x27;s Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing. In early 2006, Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match (vs Pakistan at Karachi). However, the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006, Pathan began to steadily lose pace and swing, and his wicket-taking dwindled. Although Pathan&#x27;s batting continued to be productive, he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006, and by 2007 was no longer in the squad until his return in the 2007 World Twenty20.

Irfan Pathan, along with players such as Vinod Kambli and Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, was included in the list of &quot;India&#x27;s lost boys&quot; by Shashi Tharoor.

He cemented his position in the team and was named by the International Cricket Council as the 2004 ICC Men&#x27;s Emerging Player of the Year. Pathan was instrumental in India&#x27;s ODI and Test series wins in Pakistan in 2004. He was described by the media as the &quot;&quot; of Indian cricket. In late-2004 he took 18 wickets in two Tests against Bangladesh, but the start of 2005 he performed poorly and conceded runs at a high rate, leading to a brief exile from the ODI team.

Immediately thereafter, Australian Greg Chappell, one of the leading batsmen of his time, became India&#x27;s coach (2005) and identified Pathan&#x27;s batting potential. Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all-rounder, and he opened the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match (10 Dec 2005, versus Sri Lanka in Delhi) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag. He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. For the first nine months of Chappell&#x27;s stint at the helm, Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball, scoring runs regularly and frequently taking top-order wickets. He rose to No. 2 in the ICC&#x27;s ODI rankings for all-rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings. This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev.

He returned to international cricket in September 2007 for the inaugural World Twenty20, where he took three wickets and was man of the match as India beat Pakistan in the final. Pathan became the first Indian bowler on T20 World Cup debut who picked up a wicket on the first ball. This earned him a recall into the ODI team, where he was a regular for most of the next 12 months before being dropped as his economy rate continued to trend upwards and subsequently struggled with a loss of form and injuries. In late-2007 Pathan was also recalled into the Test team after 19 months and hit his maiden Test century, but could not maintain his place in the team as his bowling was not effective enough with only two pacemen needed. Pathan played his last Test for India in April 2008 against South Africa. He continued to perform with both bat and ball at the domestic level, although his sedate pace was frequently criticized as being irrelevant at the international level. However, he impressed during the 2011–12 Ranji Trophy, where he was the leading wicket-taker, and his performances earned him a recall to the national side again.

He was a contestant in the dance reality show &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa&quot; in 2015. Irfan Pathan made his acting debut in the 2022 Indian film &quot;Cobra&quot;.

==Background and personal life==
Pathan was born 27 October 1984 in Baroda, Gujarat, India and is of Pashtun (Pathan) ancestry, belonging to the Pathan community in Gujarat. He grew up with his elder brother Yusuf in a mosque in Vadodara, in an impoverished family. His father served as the muezzin. Although their parents wished them to become Islamic scholars, Pathan and his brother took an interest in cricket. In the beginning his deliveries did not reach the other end of the cricket pitch, but rigorous six-hour training sessions in blazing heat and his family&#x27;s sense of discipline saw him progress steadily.

Pathan had a 10-year long relationship with Australia-based Shivangi Dev. She wanted to marry him but since Irfan wished his older brother Yusuf to get married prior, differences began to grow between the two and they broke up in 2012. He married a Jeddah-based model, Safa Baig, on 4 February 2016, in Mecca. They have two sons.

==Early career==
Under the guidance of former Indian captain Datta Gaekwad, Pathan rose to get selected in the Under-14 Baroda cricket team, and when he was selected at Under-15 level to represent Baroda in a national tournament, he was finally presented with a full set of cricket equipment, having before been restricted to second-hand gear due to his family&#x27;s limited economic means.

In December 1997, Pathan broke into the Baroda Under-16 team, less than two months after turning 13. He took a total of 1/35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped immediately afterwards. He did not play again for the Under-16s for two years, and in November 1999, less than a month after turning 15, he made his next appearance, this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra. He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3/41 in a victory, but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match, and spent the rest of the 1999–2000 season there. He bowled short spells in the younger division, taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches, averaging less than seven overs an innings. He had more success with the bat, scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai.

Pathan was then selected for the India Under-15 team in mid-2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries. He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches, including a best of 3/2 against Thailand, and scored 15 runs at 7.50. India won all but one of the matches, most by enormous margins.

==Youth career==
At the start of the 2000–01 season, Pathan was immediately back in the Under-19s, this time bowling more, often delivering more than 20 overs per innings. In four matches, he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out, and took 10 wickets at 32.50. He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra, prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team.

In 2003–04, he was then selected for India Emerging Players for a series of limited-overs matches against counterparts from Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Pathan took seven wickets at 11.00 in three matches, including 4/22 and 3/35 in two matches against Pakistan.

In late 2003, he was selected for the India Under-19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan, where he was the leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7.38, with an economy rate of 3.54. This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker. He was named as the player of the tournament, which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final. Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9/16 against Bangladesh, helping to bowl them out for 34, and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final, taking 3/33. Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat, compiling scores of 32, 28 and 34. Pathan returned to India and took 3/51 and 1/33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season, against Andhra Pradesh. This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003–04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia.

==Domestic career==
He started against Bengal in March 2001, after fellow left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan was selected for the national team. He scored 13 not out and 2, and took 3/40 and 2/68 in a 222-run win. However, he was unable to repeat this form in the three remaining matches, taking only two more wickets in total, but Baroda nevertheless managed to win the Ranji Trophy. He ended his maiden season with seven wickets at 43.28 and 75 runs at 12.50 with a best score of 40 not out against Orissa.

The Ranji win saw Baroda qualify for the following season&#x27;s Irani Trophy where they took on the Rest of India. Pathan scored 32 in the second innings and took 3/95 and 1/34 in a defeat, but his performance reminded Test batsman V. V. S. Laxman of Zaheer. However, he was omitted from the senior team and sent back to the Under-19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months, playing eight double-innings matches for Baroda. He took 20 wickets at 20.40, including a best of 6/41 against Gujarat, and scoring 190 runs at 31.66 with a best of 63 not out. Pathan was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai, taking 1/69 from nine overs. Pathan further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More.

In early 2002, he was selected for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand, where he took six wickets at 27.50 and scored 30 runs at 15.00, taking 2/18 in a win over South Africa.

Upon returning to India, Pathan was selected in a senior zonal team for the first time. He was selected for West Zone for the Duleep Trophy, even though he had not played a single match for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy season. He immediately repaid the selectors&#x27; faith by taking 4/74 and 6/72, his first ten-wicket match haul, in the first fixture against Central Zone, setting up a 161-run win. In the next match, he took 4/72 and 3/85 as West defeated North by 178 runs. He only took 1/55 in the next match against South but West were through to the final, where he took 4/43 to help cut down East Zone for 162 in the first innings, sealing the title. In all Pathan, had taken 22 wickets at 18.22 for the tournament, and scored 46 runs at 11.50.

These performances propelled Pathan into the India A team at the age of 17 and a half, for a tour of Sri Lanka, where he took six wickets at 35.00 in three first-class matches. Pathan then went on an India Under-19 tour of England in mid-2002. He took 15 wickets at 25.93 in the three youth Tests, which India lost 1–0, with a best of 4/83 in the Second Test. He then took four wickets at 42.00, conceding more than six runs an over, and scored 66 runs at 33.00 in the three youth ODIs, which India won 2–1.

Pathan was rewarded with selection in the Rest of India team that played against Railways in the Irani Trophy at the start of the 2002–03 season. He took a total of 2/84 and scored 29 as the Ranji champions prevailed. He struggled in the Ranji Trophy, taking 18 wickets at 39.33 in seven matches. Half of his wickets came in one match against Orissa in which he claimed 6/31 and 3/46 in an innings victory. He scored 161 runs at 23.00, with a 54 against Tamil Nadu being his maiden first-class fifty, as well as two other forties. Despite a lack of wickets for Baroda, Pathan was selected for the Duleep Trophy, playing for Elite Group A. He took 5/88 and 4/106 against Plate Group A and 4/101 against Elite Group C, before taking 3/53 and 2/42 as Elite Group A defeated Elite Group B in the final by seven wickets. Pathan ended the tournament with 19 wickets at 27.00 and scored 72 runs at 24.00. In the one-dayers, Pathan also struggled for Baroda, taking three wickets at 64.66 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.85, but he was nevertheless selected for the zonal team, where he took four wickets at 34.25 in four matches at an economy rate of 3.91.

In 2003 he was selected for the India A team which travelled to England. Playing in five first-class matches, Pathan took nine wickets at 43.77, including 4/60 against Yorkshire and 3/83 against South Africa. He managed only 8 runs at 4.00 with the bat. He had more success in the limited-overs matches, taking eight wickets at 11.12 in three matches, including a 4/19 against Lancashire, and scoring 27 runs at 27.00.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Pathan played in the domestic Challenger Trophy for the first time. Representing India A, he had little success, taking two wickets at 79.00 at an economy rate of 5.85, and he did not force his way into India&#x27;s limited-overs team. In 2019, he joined the Jammu and Kashmir cricket team as coach-cum-mentor.

In 2022, Bhilwara Kings selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy and retained him for the 2023 season as well.

==International career==
===Early years (2003–2005)===

Pathan made his Test debut in the Second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 2003. At the age of 19, he opened the bowling following an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test. In a high scoring match, he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over. He scored one in his only innings as India took a four-wicket victory. He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer, but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test. On another flat pitch, Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh, Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell of reverse swing bowling. He had Waugh caught behind from an outswinger and then bowled Gilchrist with an inswinging yorker. He ended with 2/80 in the first innings and dismissed Ricky Ponting in the second innings to end with match figures of 3/106.

In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed, Pathan was the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets at an average of 31 in his maiden ODI series. After ending with 0/61 from ten overs on debut against Australia, he bounced back to take 3/64 and 3/51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders. He earned his first international man of the match award in the tournament, after taking 4/24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI. However, his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final. In that match, he took 2/75 as Australia amassed 5/359 and crushed India by 208 runs. Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151. His batting improved towards the end of the tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings, and he ended with 86 runs at 17.20 for the tournament.

Pathan subsequently led the pace attack again on the 2004 Test tour to Pakistan, taking 12 wickets and bowling a higher proportion of maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India&#x27;s first series victory over Pakistan in two decades. In the first innings, he bowled 28 overs and took 4/100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead. After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on, Pathan tied the Pakistanis down, bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2/26 as India secured an innings win. Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order, helping India to recover to 287. However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3/107, and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win. In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi, Pathan took 2/49 and 1/35 in an innings win. He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33.

===Golden form===
He also continued his prolific wicket-taking in the ODIs, taking eight wickets at 17.87 at an economy rate of 4.76 in three matches, including three top-order wickets in the deciding fifth ODI in Lahore. He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs. His ability to swing the ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation that he could become an all rounder. In recognition of his performances at the start of his international career, Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004.

Pathan continued his productive form in ODIs at the 2004 Asian Cup in Sri Lanka, where he was the leading wicket-taker with 14 wickets at 16.28 at an economy rate of 4.37 in six matches, with three three-wicket hauls against the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively. He also scored 64 runs at 32.00 including a 38 in a defeat against Pakistan.

===Struggle in form===
He then struggled during an ODI tour in Europe, taking three wickets at 78.00 at an economy rate of 5.48 from five matches. India won only one of these games and lost four. Pathan returned to form during India&#x27;s brief campaign at the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England, where he claimed 5 wickets at an average of 9.00 and economy rate of 3.00. He took 2/11 against Kenya and 3/34 against Pakistan, but defeat at the hands of the latter ended India&#x27;s campaign.

Returning to India, Pathan then represented his country at the highest level for the first time on home soil. Pathan continued to improve his batting with a defiant 31 and 55 against Australia in October 2004 in the First Test in Bangalore. This was his first half-century in Tests, and was scored after the specialist batsmen had failed. Nevertheless, he managed a total of only 2/100 and India fell to a 217-run loss. Pathan&#x27;s career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai, in which he totalled 0/68, causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai. Australia went on to take the series 2–1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84.00 and 100 runs at 33.33. After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners, he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata, aggregating 3/89 and scoring 24 in an eight-wicket win that sealed a 1–0 series win.

===Success in return===
Pathan made his name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh. Swinging the ball both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 including several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. He played in only one of the three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win.

In late 2004, the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced central contracts for international players for the first time, and Pathan was given a B-grade contract. 2005 began rather poorly for Pathan. He took only six wickets at 68.33 in the home Test series against Pakistan after losing pace and accuracy. In the last two matches, he managed totals of 2/122 and 1/160, conceding more than four runs an over as the Pakistani batsmen scored heavily. He scored 64 runs at 16.00 and made a duck in the second innings of the Third Test as the hosts collapsed on the last day to squander the series 1–1.

===Ups and downs===
He was subsequently dropped for the ODI series, playing in only one match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs. However, he did manage to post his first ODI half-century, scoring 64, defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213, sealing a 106-run loss. Greg Chappell became the coach of the Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder. He started to hone Pathan&#x27;s batting skills, which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64.
Pathan was subsequently signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season, where he attempted to regain his form after his bad start to the year. Pathan arrived in late-May and stayed for six weeks. He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series, taking six wickets at 24.66 and an economy rate of 5.41 in four one-dayers, including 3/42 against Essex. In the new Twenty20 format, Pathan took 12 wickets at 12.75 and an economy rate of 6.37 in seven matches, including a best of 4/27 against Essex. He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31-run win. However, his difficulties in first-class matches continued. He took 4/81 and 1/68, and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex, and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out. However, he failed to take another wicket and ended with five wickets at 64.80 and 126 runs at 63.00, scoring 68 against Surrey.

Pathan was recalled to the ODI team for the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August. This was Chappell&#x27;s first series as a coach, in which Pathan played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33.83 at an economy rate of 4.41, but conceded 0/59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final. He scored 58 runs at 29.00 including an unbeaten 36 after India&#x27;s batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match.

===Making history===
He showed further signs of returning to peak form in the Videocon Triangular Series in Zimbabwe, taking 10 wickets at 16.10 at an economy rate of 5.03 and scored 60 runs at 30.00 in four matches. This included a haul of 3/34 and then a score of 50 as India collapsed to 164 all out and a 51-run loss to New Zealand. In another match, he took his ODI career best of 5/27 against Zimbabwe in Harare as the hosts fell for 65. Despite his overall good form, Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final, conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs as India lost their second successive final. He was subsequently the leading wicket-taker as India took a 2–0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe. In the First Test in Bulawayo, Pathan took 5/58 and 4/53 as well as scoring 52 in a man of the match performance to help India to an innings victory. He followed this with a 7/59 haul, his Test career best innings haul, and 5/67 in the final Test in Harare, his second ten-wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory, having also scored 32 in the first innings. He was again named man of the match, and his 21 wickets at 11.29 runs saw him named man of the series. This made him only the third bowler after Anil Kumble and Johnny Briggs to take 21 wickets in a two-match series.

Upon the team&#x27;s return to India, Chappell experimented with Pathan by using him as an opening batsman in the Challenger Trophy prior to the late 2005 series against Sri Lankan cricket team. This yielded only moderate success with scores of 28 and 11 not out. Pathan took six wickets at 29.16 at an economy rate of 5.17. Pathan was subsequently used at No. 3 in the batting line-up in the First ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur, where he scored 83 runs from 70 balls to help India post a total of 6/350. Pathan also took 4/37 and 3/38 in the second and seventh matches at Mohali and Baroda respectively to win two-man of the match awards, taking ten wickets at 25.60 at ane economy rate of 5.22 for the whole series. He added a 35 in the final match and ended the series with 118 runs at 39.33, playing akey role in India&#x27;s 6–1 triumph. Pathan continued his strong ODI form with another man of the match performance of 3/23 and a knock of 37 runs against South Africa in the second ODI in Bangalore, having scored 46 in the middle-order in the first match after a top-order collapse. He ended the series with six wickets at 20.33 at an economy rate of 4.69 and 83 runs at 27.66.

After scoring two consecutive ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pathan was elevated to opening in the second innings of the Second Test in Delhi, after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, Pathan scored 93 runs, building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad, he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall during the first half of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century. Following his strong performances in 2005, Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

Pathan had another difficult start to the new year in 2006 on the Test tour to Pakistan. In the first two Test matches played on flat surfaces in Lahore and Faisalabad, he had little success against the Pakistani batsmen, taking a total of two wickets while conceding 319 runs at more than four runs an over. After not getting an opportunity in the First Test—India lost only one wicket—Pathan made use of the good batting conditions himself and scored 90 in a double century partnership with wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Faisalabad. Pathan found success with the ball in the Third Test in Karachi, when on 29 January he became the first – and to date only – person to claim a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match. It was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed (130.18: Salman Butt 34.27, Younis Khan 46.04, Mohammad Yousuf 49.86) and came after 1783 Tests in the history of cricket. He had Butt caught by Dravid in the slips from an outswinger, before trapping Younis leg before wicket and bowling Yousuf, both with inswingers. He finished with a haul of 5/61 after the hosts staged a lower-order counter-attack but was punished in the second innings, taking 1 wicket while conceding 106 runs as Pakistan set a target which was beyond India&#x27;s reach. Pathan ended the series with 134 runs at 44.66 and took eight wickets at 60.75. Despite his Test travails, Pathan continued to perform strongly in the ODI arena, scoring 65 in the top order in the first ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar before making three consecutive three wicket hauls in the following matches. This included a man of the match performance that included a haul of 3 wickets for 43 runs at Rawalpindi as he claimed nine wickets at 18.88 at an economy rate of 4.49 for the series. Having taken an unassailable 3–1 lead, India rested Pathan for the final match.

Pathan had a quiet series against England following his return to India, taking 8 wickets at an average of 39.37 runs and scoring 121 runs at an average of 24.20 runs in three Tests. Pathan scored 52 in the first innings of the Second Test in Mohali, helping India to a first-innings lead and eventually a nine-wicket win. In the Third Test, Pathan managed only 1/84 in total and scored 26 and 6 as they collapsed on the final day and ceded their series lead. Again his ODI form was unaffected, taking eleven wickets at 15.63 in five matches, and scoring 123 runs at 41.00 with the bat as India easily claimed the series 5–1. Pathan scored 28 and then took 3/21 in a low-scoring 29-win in the first match, before scoring 36 and taking 4/51 in the third match in Goa. India then took an unassailable 4–0 lead by winning the fourth match, in which Pathan took 1/27 before scoring 46 in the run-chase.

=== Drop in form again ===
Pathan began to suffer a loss of form during the tour of the West Indies in May 2006, when he managed only 24 runs at 6.00 and took 6 wickets at 29.83 at an economy rate of 5.59 while bowling in the ODI arena as India lost the series 4–1. After a poor display in a tour match, in which he was hit for 70 runs in 12 overs and appeared jaded, he was dropped from the Test team as V. R. V. Singh became the third place bowler and captain Rahul Dravid scrapped the five bowler strategy. Pathan only played once in the Second Test, after Sreesanth was sidelined due to injury. He scored 19 and took 1/43 and 1/50 as India enforced the follow on but the hosts hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand. India then selected two spinners in the last two Tests, and Pathan could not gain one of the two pace positions. Chappell stated that Pathan was fatigued and had been overworked but was confident that Pathan &quot;would recover from his slump and rise to further heights&quot;, asserting that he was still young and learning. Former India paceman Javagal Srinath expressed concern about Pathan&#x27;s dwindling pace, but expressed that swing was the first priority in backing Pathan&#x27;s return to international cricket.

These concerns were further magnified in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs in the first two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, Pathan was dropped for the rest of the tournament. He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.

Pathan was then demoted from the position of an opening bowler in ODIs during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; he took four wickets at 24.00 at an economy rate of 4.80, and scored only 29 runs at 9.66, as India were knocked out in the first round. Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa. Playing in three of the five matches, he took a solitary wicket at 136.00, conceding 7.15 runs per over, the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match; they were whitewashed by the hosts.

Since the West Indies tour in May 2006, Pathan had only been taking wickets at 41.33. He subsequently fell out of the Top 10 of the ICC bowling rankings and the Top 5 of the All rounder rankings after having spent the previous year on the list. Despite this, Indian captain Rahul Dravid remained optimistic about Pathan&#x27;s prospects, stating &quot;The number of Man-of-the-Matches that Irfan has won is a testimony to the fact that he&#x27;s a proven matchwinner for us. He takes wickets early, contributes with the bat, is good in the field.&quot; Despite top scoring in both innings of a first-class warm-up match in Potchefstroom, scoring 111 not out and 40 not out whilst many specialist batsmen failed to cope with the bouncy conditions, he totalled only 1/49 from eight overs with the ball and was overlooked by the selectors for the First Test in Johannesburg. This indicated that although he had scored 560 runs at 35.00 under Chappell&#x27;s coaching, they saw bowling, which had been steadily declining, as his primary responsibility. After a poor bowling display in the subsequent tour match in which he conceded 74 runs in only 11 overs, Pathan became the first player to be sent home by the BCCI during a tour for poor performance rather than indiscipline. It was later revealed by Kiran More that it was a mutual agreement so that Pathan could play for Baroda in the final two rounds of Ranji Trophy in an attempt to regain form via match practice instead of watching the final two Tests from the sidelines. He subsequently led Baroda to the semi-finals after scoring 82* to help defeat Uttar Pradesh by five wickets, but his bowling remained ineffective, returning figures of 2/108 and 1/59, conceding 4.77 runs per over. Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar attributed Pathan&#x27;s situation to mismanagement, asserting that Pathan has been &quot;messed about&quot; as well as insinuating foul play. Pathan&#x27;s fortunes improved in the next two matches, totalling 5/92 and 7/96 against Tamil Nadu and Mumbai respectively.

Pathan was initially dropped for the ODI series hosted by India against the West Indies, but was recalled for the final match in his home town after claiming seven wickets against Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final. His performance was regarded as lacklustre, taking 1/43 from seven overs. The selectors persisted and named him in the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, but injury stopped him from playing in the ODI series against Sri Lanka, denying him an opportunity to regain form.
Pathan on his return took two wickets of the overs which he bowled. He had an impressive start as he took the wicket of Lendl Simmons as a Leg Before Wicket. For his performances in 2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.

After taking 1/12 and 3/25 in warm-up matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in the Caribbean, Pathan did not play a match at the World Cup, and was among a group of players to be dropped from the squad following India&#x27;s exit from the first round. He played no part in the tours of Bangladesh and England. Instead, he was sent on an India A tour of Africa. Two years after devastating the Zimbabwean batsmen, he played against a Zimbabwe Select XI, he took only six wickets at 30.16 in two matches, and then took eight wickets at 18.12 in two matches against Kenya. India won all four matches, and Pathan scored 87 runs at 21.75. Pathan then took six wickets at 23.83 and scored 93 runs at 31.00 in four one-dayers.

===Strong comeback===
With India&#x27;s older players opting out of the inaugural World Twenty20, Pathan was one of several younger players to regain national selection. India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat.

As a result of his performances in South Africa, Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007. He played in all 12 matches, seven against Australia and five against Pakistan. Pathan scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02, averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics. It was a steady performance; Pathan never took more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan.

With India opting to field two spinners and two pacemen on turning tracks in the home Test series against Pakistan in late 2007, Pathan missed the first two Tests as Zaheer and Rudra Pratap Singh were the fast bowlers chosen. In the meantime, he took 11 wickets at 23.81 and scored 90 runs at 30.00 in two Ranji Trophy matches. Injury to both Zaheer and Singh in his colleagues resulted in his recall for the Third Test at Bangalore. Pathan scored his maiden Test century, reaching the mark with a six from leg spinner Danish Kaneria to move from 96 to 102 with only last man, paceman Ishant Sharma left to accompany him, before holing out in the same over. He made 21 not out in the second innings but was unpenetrative with the ball, taking a total of 1/110 as the tourists hung on for a draw.

Pathan gained selection for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, but did not play in the first two Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth, Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted for more than two hours and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award.

After his batting displays in Perth, Pathan was promoted to open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack. In a high-scoring match, Pathan took 3/112, but he struggled with the responsibility of opening, scoring nine and a duck. In a high-scoring match, he took 3/112 in Australia&#x27;s 563.Following the Test series, he top-scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one-off T20 international. Pathan held his place in the ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy, scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49. His best performance was a 4/41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss. His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka. Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia, taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2–0 win.
An extra bowler backfired as the batsmen struggled. Pathan top-scored with 21* in India&#x27;s first innings of 76 on the first morning and was again unbeaten in the second innings with 43. However, he failed to take a wicket and conceded 85 runs in only 21.2 overs in an innings defeat, and was omitted from the next Test. After the South Africa series, Pathan participated in the 2008 Indian Premier League, having been purchased by the Kings XI Punjab.

He took 15 wickets at 23.33 at the economy rate of 6.60 runs per over. His most effective performance came when he added an unbeaten 24 and took 2/18 from his four overs to help Punjab to a nine-run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders. He scored 131 runs at 21.83 and added 40 in a failed run-chase against Chennai Super Kings.

===Back on the fringes===

Following the IPL, Pathan resumed international duties in the Kitply Cup and the 2008 Asia Cup. He had an unproductive time with the ball; although he scored a total of 86 runs at 28.66, he took seven wickets at 51.42 at an economy rate of 6.56. Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one-dayers, but played in only three of the five fixtures. He took three wickets at 34.66, conceding 5.20 runs an over, and struggled with the bat, scoring 19 runs at 6.33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match. He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia. He had average results, taking four wickets at 43.75 and an economy rate of 4.86, and scored 56 runs at 18.66 in four games. He did better the Challenger Trophy, taking six wickets at 14.00 at an economy rate of 3.42, and scored 71 runs at 35.50 as India Blue won all three matches.

At the start of the first-class season, Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1/91 for the Board President&#x27;s XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series, and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen. He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy. He played in four matches and performed strongly, taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20. He started the season with 6/85 and 1/34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh, and then took 4/42 and 1/46 against Railways. He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra. Pathan took 5/64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead. After taking 1/61 in the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand. In his final Ranji fixture for the season, he took 7/35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77, setting up an innings win. However, with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy, Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England. Pathan&#x27;s domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty. Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs, he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He took 0/57 from ten overs in the fifth match, as India recorded another victory, but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled. Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka, but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3–0 lead. He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches, but was again expensive, conceding 7.06 runs an over. However, he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry; Irfan ended on 33 not out. Pathan returned to India and took 3/50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season, which ended in a win, before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand.

Pathan had a poor time in New Zealand. In the two T20 internationals preceding the ODIs, he took 0/38 and 2/41, conceding his runs at an alarming economy rate of 11.28. He was left out of all five ODIs during the tour before heading home. He then played in all 14 of Punjab&#x27;s round-robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa, taking 17 wickets at 22.94 with an economy rate of 7.74, and scored 196 runs at 19.60. He started strongly, taking nine wickets in four matches in the early stages of the tournament, before taking only two in the next five matches, and ending with six in the last three fixtures. Punjab failed to make the semi-finals.

Pathan&#x27;s performances in the IPL were enough for him to retain his position in the national T20 team after his performances in New Zealand, and he then proceeded to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June, where India were seeking to defend their title. He struggled in the warm-up matches, totalling 1/49 in five overs, and again in the first round of matches, bowling five overs and conceding 42 runs without success. Nevertheless, India defeated both Bangladesh and Ireland to move into the next round. He took 1/9 from two overs in the loss to the West Indies in the Super 8 round, and was left out for the remaining two matches, which India lost to be eliminated.

Since then, Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team and was then injured for an extended period, until he made his return to cricket in the Ranji Trophy in November. He played in six matches for Baroda as captain and was successful with both bat and ball, scoring 397 runs at 49.62 and taking 22 wickets at 18.54. In his most productive first-class season with the bat, Pathan made starts in eight of his nine innings, only failing to reach 24 once, and scoring four fifties, although he was unable to convert any to triple figures. In his fourth match of the season, Pathan top-scored in both innings with 68 and 81 as Baroda lost to Karnataka by an innings after making 153 and 223. He then took a total of 7/76 and scored 65 not out to secure a seven-wicket win over Saurashtra, and then totalled 7/96 in a seven-wicket triumph over Maharashtra. However, these performances were not enough to earn Pathan a Test recall. Furthermore, on 25 February 2010 the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced its list of 30 probables for the T20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies, the most notable omission being Irfan Pathan.

Pathan took 5/100 in the first innings of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone. His fifth wicket brought up his 300th scalp at first-class level. After cricket was engulfed in a series of corruption scandals in September 2010, Pathan told the media that he had received &quot;three expensive gifts in his room&quot; and, later, two further gifts that he could not afford. Pathan reported this to the team management as he thought the gifts might be from a bookmaker.

=== Comeback and knee injury 2011===
Irfan Pathan was recalled for India&#x27;s ODI squad for last two matches of five match one-day series against West Indies in December 2011, and played in last match of the series, picking the wicket of first ball.

He was selected for the Commonwealth Bank Series, playing four games and scoring 96 runs at an average of 24 with a top score of 47. He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16; his best figures were 3/16. His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad. He played three matches and did not get a chance to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4/32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka. He picked up two more wickets in the next two games. He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4–0–44–1 but was yet to bat. Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012, taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12.
BCCI announced on 13 July 2012 inclusion of Irfan Pathan in the Indian team for the tour of Sri Lanka as a replacement to the injured Vinay Kumar. With his all round performance, India managed to win four of the five ODIs and the lone T20 match in the next series in Sri Lanka. Pathan emerged as the top wicket taker with a five-wicket haul.

Pathan was a part of the Indian squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka. In the Ranji Trophy 2012–13 opener against Karnataka, Pathan raised his First-class top-score to 121 with his 3rd domestic hundred. But, he injured his knee during match and only made comeback to cricket in March 2013. In 2014 he was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad to play in the Indian Premier League.

=== Retirement ===
Irfan Pathan retired from all forms of cricket in January 2020.

==Beyond cricket==
===Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa===
Pathan was a contestant on the Colors TV popular dance show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa for the 8th season, in 2015. He impressed many people with his dancing skills, staying until he quit in the 6th week on 22 August 2015.

=== Cricket Academy of Pathans ===
The Cricket Academy Of Pathans was jointly launched by Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan. The academy has tied up with former Indian coach Kapil Dev and Cameron Tradell as chief mentors. Chappell would coach the coaches of the academy.

<text> () is generally translated as compassion or mercy and sometimes as self-compassion or spiritual longing. It is a significant spiritual concept in the Indic religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, is one of the fundamental virtues and qualities that a spiritual aspirant is encouraged to cultivate. Many Hindu deities are depicted as embodiments of compassion. Karuṇā is often linked with other virtues such as &quot;Maitri&quot; (loving-kindness) and &quot;Ahimsa&quot; (non-violence). Together, these virtues form the foundation of a righteous and spiritually fulfilling life. The word comes from the Sanskrit kara, meaning “to do” or “to make,” indicating an action-based form of compassion, rather than the pity or sadness associated with the English word. In Hindu mythology, the concept of &quot;Karuṇā&quot; or compassionate action is deeply embedded and is often illustrated through stories, characters, and teachings. Each avatar&#x27;s story of Hindu pantheon is an embodiment of divine compassion in action. For instance, in Shiva tandava stotra, Shiva is described as Karunavataram, meaning compassion personified. 

===Navarasa===
Karuna is one of the nine primary rasas (aesthetic principles) in classical Indian arts and literature.&quot;Karuṇā Rasa,&quot; or the sentiment of compassion, is a pivotal theme in the Ramayana, one of India&#x27;s principal epics. The narrative commences with the sage Valmiki observing a tragic incident involving a pair of krauncha birds (Sarus cranes), setting the emotional tone for the epic. Witnessing the male bird being killed by a hunter, leaving its partner in anguish, Valmiki is moved to curse the hunter through a spontaneous verse, which ultimately becomes the Ramayana&#x27;s first shloka (verse). This moment, steeped in sorrow and compassion, not only initiates the composition of the epic but also symbolically prefigures the central narrative of love, loss, and separation experienced by the protagonists, Rama and Sita, embodying the essence of &quot;Karuṇā Rasa.&quot; Following this, the god Brahma instructs Valmiki to write Rama&#x27;s story, revealing the entire tale to him.

===Yoga===
The foundational work of Yoga, Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras—a comprehensive compilation of Sanskrit aphorisms elucidating the theory and practice of yoga—specifically emphasize the concept of Karuna. 

The verse &quot;maitrī-karuṇā-muditopekṣaṇāṃ sukha-duḥkha-puṇyāpuṇya-viṣayāṇāṃ bhāvanātaś citta-prasādanam&quot; advocates for the cultivation of friendliness (Maitri), compassion (Karuna), joy (Mudita), and equanimity (Upeksha) in response to life&#x27;s dualities: happiness (Sukha) and suffering (Duhkha), as well as moral virtue (Punya) and vice (Apunya). This practice, according to Patanjali, is instrumental in achieving a state of mental tranquility (Chittaprasadanam), underscoring the psychological and ethical dimensions integral to yoga&#x27;s philosophical framework.

==Buddhism==
 is important in all schools of Buddhism. For Theravada Buddhists, dwelling in is a means for attaining a happy present life and heavenly rebirth. For Mahāyāna Buddhists, is a co-requisite for becoming a Bodhisattva.

===Theravada Buddhism===
In Theravāda Buddhism, is one of the four &quot;divine abodes&quot; (), along with loving kindness (Pāli: ), sympathetic joy (), and equanimity (). In the Pali canon, Gautama Buddha recommends cultivating these four virtuous mental states to both householders and monastics. When one develops these four states, Buddha counsels radiating them in all directions, as in the following stock canonical phrase regarding :

Such a practice purifies one&#x27;s mind, avoids evil-induced consequences, leads to happiness in one&#x27;s present life, and, if there is a future karmic rebirth, it will be in a heavenly realm.

The Pali commentaries distinguish between and in the following complementary manner: is the desire to remove harm and suffering () from others; while is the desire to bring about the well-being and happiness () of others.
The &quot;far enemy&quot; of is cruelty, a mind-state in obvious opposition. The &quot;near enemy&quot; (quality which superficially resembles but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is (sentimental) pity: here too one wants to remove suffering, but for a partly selfish (attached) reason hence not the pure motivation. 
In the Pāli Canon, Buddhas are also described as choosing to teach &quot;out of compassion for beings.&quot;

===Mahayana Buddhism===
In Mahāyāna Buddhism, is one of the two qualities, along with enlightened wisdom (Sanskrit: ), to be cultivated on the bodhisattva path. According to scholar Rupert Gethin, this elevation of to the status of prajña is one of the distinguishing factors between the Theravāda arahant ideal and the Mahāyāna bodhisattva ideal:
Throughout the Mahāyāna world, Avalokiteśvara (Sanskrit; Chinese: Guan Yin; Japanese: Kannon; Tibetan: Chenrezig) is a bodhisattva who embodies .

In the Intermediate section of the &quot;Stages of Meditation&quot; by Kamalaśīla, he writes:
In Tibetan Buddhism, one of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled &quot;Meditative Concentration&quot;, Shantideva describes meditation on Karunā as thus:

==Jainism==
 is associated with the Jain practice of compassion. For instance, is one of the four reflections of universal friendship—along with amity (Sanskrit: ), appreciation () and equanimity (&quot;madhyastha&quot;)—used to stop (&quot;samvara&quot;) the influx of karma.

==Miscellaneous==
 is a common first name throughout India, used for both genders.

===In literature===
In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s novel &quot;Island&quot;, the concept of &quot;karuna&quot; is pivotal to the philosophical and spiritual ethos of the society depicted in the book. In the novel, it represents an ideal of emotional intelligence and empathetic living, contrasting with the more self-centered and materialistic attitudes seen in the Western world. This concept is central to the practices and worldview of the inhabitants of Pala, a fictional island situated between the Andaman Islands and Sumatra. Huxley uses the mynah birds throughout the novel as a recurring motif to reinforce the importance of mindfulness and compassion in Pala&#x27;s society. The birds are trained to repeat &quot;Karuna&quot; at key moments, such as during moments of stress, conflict, or potential violence. This serves to remind the islanders (and the reader) to approach situations with understanding and empathy.

<text>Roger Connor (July 1, 1857 – January 4, 1931) was an American 19th-century Major League Baseball (MLB) player. He played for several teams, but his longest tenure was in New York, where he was responsible for the New York Gothams becoming known as the Giants. He was the player whom Babe Ruth succeeded as the all-time career home run champion. Connor hit 138 home runs during his 18-year career, and his career home run record stood for 23 years after his retirement in 1897.

Connor owned and managed minor league baseball teams after his playing days. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by its Veterans Committee in 1976. Largely forgotten after his retirement, Connor was buried in an unmarked grave until a group of citizens raised money for a grave marker in 2001.

==Early life==
Connor was born in Waterbury, Connecticut. He was the son of Irish immigrants Mortimer Connor and Catherine Sullivan Connor. His father had arrived in the United States only five years before Roger&#x27;s birth. The family lived in the Irish section of Waterbury, known as the Abrigador district, which was separated from the rest of the city by a large granite hill. Connor was the third of eleven children born to the family, though two did not survive childhood. His younger brother, Joe, also played in the majors over several seasons from 1895 to 1905. Connor left school around age 12 to work with his father at the local brass works.

Connor entered professional baseball with the Waterbury Monitors of the Eastern League in 1876. Though he was left-handed, Connor was initially a third baseman; in early baseball, left-handed third basemen were more common than they are in modern baseball. In 1878 he would transfer to the minor league Holyoke Shamrocks, where he became known for hitting home runs across the field into the Connecticut River. This so impressed Springfield baseball boss Bob Ferguson that he signed Connor onto the National League (NL) Troy Trojans when he bought them out in 1880.

==MLB playing career==

===Early years (1880–1889)===
In Connor&#x27;s first year with the Troy Trojans, he teamed with future Hall of Fame players Dan Brouthers, Buck Ewing, Tim Keefe and Mickey Welch, all of whom were just starting their careers. Also on that 1880 Trojans team, though much older, was player-manager Bob &quot;Death to Flying Things&quot; Ferguson. Though Connor, Ferguson and Welch were regularly in the lineup, the other future stars each played in only a handful of the team&#x27;s 83 games that season. The team finished in fourth place with a 41–42 win–loss record. Connor committed 60 errors in 83 games and sustained a shoulder injury, prompting a position change to first baseman for 1881.

He later played for the New York Gothams, and, due to his great stature, gave that team the enduring nickname &quot;Giants&quot;. Connor hit baseball&#x27;s first grand slam on September 10, 1881, at Riverfront Park in Rensselaer, New York. His grand slam came with two outs and his team down three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, a situation known today as a walk-off home run. George Vecsey, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Roger Connor was a complete player — a deft first baseman and an agile base runner who hit 233 triples and stole 244 bases despite his size (6 feet 3 inches and 200 pounds).&quot;
He led the NL with a .371 average in 1885. On September 11, 1886, Connor hit a ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a very difficult park in which to hit home runs. He hit the pitch from Boston&#x27;s Old Hoss Radbourn over the right field fence and onto 112th Street. The New York Times reported of the feat, &quot;He met it squarely and it soared up with the speed of a carrier pigeon. All eyes were turned on the tiny sphere as it soared over the head of Charlie Buffinton in right field.&quot; A group of fans with the New York Stock Exchange took up a collection for Connor and bought him a $500 gold watch in honor of the home run.

===Players&#x27; League (1890)===
Another New York baseball team, also known as the Giants, emerged with the founding of the Players&#x27; League (PL) in 1890. Several players from the NL team left for the new league&#x27;s Giants team, including future Hall of Famers Connor, Keefe, Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Hank O&#x27;Day. In 123 games, Connor registered 169 hits, a .349 batting average, 14 home runs, 103 runs batted in (RBI) and 22 stolen bases. His home run total led the league and it represented the only major league single-season home run title that he won. Connor experimented with some changes to his batting style that year. He hit more balls to the opposite field and he sometimes batted right-handed, though he did not have much success from the right side.

Though Connor had success in his season with the PL, the league struggled. Some of the teams ran into financial difficulties. National League teams rescheduled many of their games to conflict with PL games in the same cities, and a high number of PL games were cancelled late in the season due to rainouts. Connor was optimistic that the league would be successful in 1891, but it officially broke up that January.

===Later career (1891–1897)===
Returning to the NL Giants for a season in 1891, Connor hit .294. In the offseason before 1892, Connor signed with the Philadelphia Athletics. The team broke up shortly after Connor signed, and his contract was awarded to the Philadelphia Phillies for that year. He returned to the Giants in 1893, raising his average to .322 and hitting 11 home runs. During the 1894 season, the Giants looked toward the team&#x27;s youth and Connor lost his starting position to Jack Doyle. He was released that year and picked up by the St. Louis Browns. The next year, his brother Joe Connor made his major league debut with the same team. Joe played two games with St. Louis before being sent back down to the minor leagues. That year&#x27;s St. Louis team finished with a 39–92 record, games out of first place.

Connor was released by the Browns in May 1897 after starting the season with a .227 batting average. His major league playing career was over. While a major league player, Connor was regularly among the league leaders in batting average and home runs. Connor&#x27;s career mark of 138 was a benchmark not surpassed until 1921 by Babe Ruth. He finished his career with a .317 batting average. Connor finished in the top ten in batting average ten times, all between 1880 and 1891. Over an 18-year career, Connor finished in the top ten for doubles ten times, finished in the top three for triples seven times and remains fifth all-time in triples with 233. He was also the first player to reach 1,000 career walks. He also established his power credentials by finishing in the top ten in RBI ten times and top ten in homers twelve times.

==Personal life==
In 1886, Connor and his wife Angeline had a daughter named Lulu. She died as an infant. Connor interpreted the baby&#x27;s death as God&#x27;s punishment for marrying Angeline, who was not Catholic. Angeline had secretly begun receiving Catholic education and was planning to surprise Connor by getting baptized on the day that Lulu would have turned a year old. The couple later adopted a girl named Cecelia from a Catholic orphanage in New York City.

Roger and Angeline Connor lived in Waterbury, Connecticut, for many years, even while Roger played in New York. Every winter, a banquet was held in Waterbury in Connor&#x27;s honor. Near the end of the 19th century, Angeline gave Roger a weather vane which had been constructed from two of his baseball bats. The weather vane served as a well-known landmark in Waterbury even after the couple moved away.

==Later life==

===Minor league baseball===
Connor signed with the Fall River Indians of the New England League in June 1897. Connor attracted some attention by wearing eyeglasses on the field. He hit cleanup, played first base and was popular among fans. In 1898, Connor moved back to his hometown of Waterbury and purchased the local minor league team. He served as president, manager and played first base on the side. Connor&#x27;s wife, Angeline, kept the team&#x27;s books and his daughter helped by collecting tickets. Joe Connor was the team&#x27;s catcher; he later returned to the major leagues for several seasons. After the 1899 season, Connor expressed satisfaction with his Waterbury team, saying that the team played well and did not lose money despite not getting strong attendance numbers at their games.

In 1901, Connor became interested in purchasing the minor league franchise in Hartford, Connecticut. The team had been dropped from the Eastern League and had suffered financial losses related to traveling as far away as Canada for games. Connor proposed that he might purchase the team and attempt to have it admitted to the Connecticut State League, decreasing its travel requirements. However, upon selling the Waterbury club at the end of that season, he bought the Springfield Ponies franchise in the same league.

===Retirement from baseball===

In September 1903, Connor announced his retirement from baseball and placed his team up for sale. He had made a similar statement the year before and apparently on a frequent basis before that. In June 1902, the local newspaper said, &quot;Roger bobs up every summer and makes his farewell to the baseball public.&quot; His 1903 retirement was earnest though; he attended a 1904 Springfield-Norwich game as a retired spectator.

Connor worked as a school inspector in Waterbury until 1920. He lived to see his career home run record bested by Babe Ruth, although if it was celebrated, it might have been on the wrong day. At one time, Connor&#x27;s record was thought to be 131, per the &quot;Sporting News&quot; book &quot;Daguerreotypes&quot;. As late as the 1980s, in the MacMillan &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;, it was thought to be 136. However, John Tattersall&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Home Run Handbook&quot;, a publication of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), credited Connor with 138. Both MLB.com and the independent Baseball-Reference.com now consider Connor&#x27;s total to be 138.

===Death===
Connor died on January 4, 1931, following a lengthy stomach illness, at the age of 73. A news article after his death said his &quot;likeable personality and his colorful action made him an idol.&quot;

He was interred in an unmarked grave at St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery in Waterbury.

Decades after his death, Waterbury citizens, as well as through donations from baseball fans, raised enough money to purchase a headstone for his grave, which was dedicated in a 2001 ceremony.

Connor was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976. Baseball Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem had long campaigned on behalf of Connor&#x27;s inclusion to the Hall of Fame.

<doc id="555339" wikidata="Q243789" url="?curid=555339" title="Christina Aguilera (album)">
<text>Christina Aguilera is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Christina Aguilera. It was released on August 24, 1999, by RCA Records. After recording &quot;Reflection&quot;, the theme song for the 1998 Disney film &quot;Mulan&quot;, RCA laid the foundation for the album immediately and started presenting Aguilera with tracks for her debut album, which they originally decided would have a January 1999 release. Primarily a dance-pop and teen pop album, its music incorporates bubblegum pop, R&amp;B, soul, hip hop, as well as ballads. Contributions to the album&#x27;s production came from a wide range of producers, including Johan Åberg, David Frank, Ron Fair, Guy Roche, Robin Thicke, Matthew Wilder and Aaron Zigman.

The album received positive reviews, with critics praising Aguilera&#x27;s vocal performance and technique. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies. The album was certified octuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold over nine million copies in the US, and is among the best-selling albums by women. The album remains Aguilera&#x27;s best-selling album, with sales of over 14 million copies worldwide. &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; reached the Top 10 in Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, Spain, and South Africa. It earned Aguilera the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.

The album spawned four hit singles; &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; and &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;, all topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with the former single also reaching number one in 20 additional countries; while the album&#x27;s third single &quot;I Turn to You&quot; also reached number three on the Hot 100 chart. Furthermore, Aguilera embarked on her debut headlining concert tour in 2000. The album was later included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Background and development ==
In her 1998 interview for the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Christina Aguilera noted that her dream &quot;has always been to record an album before I was out of high school&quot;. The singer approached record label RCA Records, then had financial difficulties, and was told to contact Disney. After being given the opportunity to record the theme to the 1998 film &quot;Mulan&quot; named &quot;Reflection&quot; it was reported she had gained a record deal with RCA with Aguilera saying &quot;I landed a record deal simultaneously as I landed the &quot;Mulan&quot; soundtrack. I had just turned seventeen years old, and during the same week, I just landed both. I recorded the &quot;Mulan&quot; soundtrack first and then a few months later I was out in L.A. recording the record for about six months&quot;. When asked about the song and Aguilera, RCA executive Ron Fair commented,
She is a badass genius for singing. She was put on this earth to sing, and I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of singers. ... When Aguilera met with us, she didn&#x27;t care that she was auditioning for a record deal; she got into a performance zone that you see in artist much more mature than she is.
After she was asked to hit a musical note required for &quot;Reflection&quot;, she thought that the song could be the gateway into an album deal. Aguilera spent hours recording a cover of Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Run to You&quot;, which included the note she was asked to hit. After successfully hitting the note, which she called &quot;the note that changed my life&quot;, she was given the opportunity to record the song. To record the song, she flew to Los Angeles for roughly a week. Despite growing increasingly exhausted during the recording sessions, when she heard that a 90-piece orchestra would be arriving to record the instrumental she begged to stay and witness the event. She later called the experience &quot;amazing&quot;. Due to the success around the recording of &quot;Reflection&quot;, RCA wished for Aguilera to record and release an album by September 1998 to maintain the &quot;hype&quot; surrounding her at that time. The label laid the foundation for the album immediately and started presenting Aguilera with tracks for her debut album, which they later decided would have a January 1999 release. &quot;Reflection&quot; was written and produced by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel, whom later co-wrote with Aguilera &quot;We&#x27;re a Miracle&quot;.

== Recording and production ==

&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; was recorded between 1998 and 1999, with Ron Fair serving as the album&#x27;s executive producer. The label reportedly spent $1 million on writers, producers and voice lessons. According to Fair, &quot;She was very much a raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. We wanted to find the ones that could knock the door down and put her up there.&quot; The album was built around pop songs, which was against Aguilera&#x27;s will, since she wanted a more R&amp;B album. She further explained during an interview for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;I was held back a lot from doing more R&amp;B ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh-sounding young pop record and that&#x27;s not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn&#x27;t get it, didn&#x27;t want to hear me out because of my age, and that was a little bit frustrating. Since all the success, it&#x27;s a little easier to get my opinions across.&quot;
One of the first producers of the album was Guy Roche, who produced two tracks (&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; and &quot;I Turn to You&quot;) and co-wrote one of them (&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;), along with Shelly Peiken. &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the &quot;lighter&quot; version for a more &quot;funky&quot; R&amp;B version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track &quot;Come on Over&quot;, first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, &quot;We&#x27;re going to give it more of an edge, R&amp;B it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there.&quot; Peiken co-wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Love You&quot;, &quot;Too Beautiful for Words&quot;, and &quot;Dreamy Eyes&quot;, but those songs — though recorded — were scrapped, as the album only had space for twelve tracks. &quot;Too Beautiful for Words&quot; was later released as a B-side on Aguilera&#x27;s single &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;.

Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One&#x27;s song &quot;I Turn to You&quot;, written by Diane Warren who also wrote &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Somebody&quot;. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually break into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna&#x27;s career) wrote and produced two tracks (&quot;Love for All Seasons&quot; and &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;), Travon Potts and Brock Walsh wrote and produced &quot;Blessed&quot;, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced &quot;When You Put Your Hands on Me&quot;. The song has been called a &quot;slinky R&amp;B standout&quot; that &quot;celebrates the alchemy of sex&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Kenneth Partridge. In retrospect, Thicke noted: &quot;She [Aguilera] came up to the studio, we did a couple songs, and we just all knew she was going to be a star. We just all knew.&quot;

Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera titled &quot;So Emotional&quot; which was originally written for Selena&#x27;s album, but unfortunately she died at the age of 23. The track&#x27;s producer, Ron Harris, revealed that Aguilera in-between recordings &quot;was only listening to Mariah Carey and Brandy, putting on her Walkman and practicing their riffs and runs, before she did her ad-libs. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, which Aguilera almost didn&#x27;t record, &quot;because there were a lot of other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight a little bit to get it&quot;, she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote along with producers Heather Holley and Rob Hoffman a track called &quot;I Will Be&quot;, which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Vanishing&quot;. The duo also wrote and produced the album&#x27;s final track &quot;Obvious&quot;, and &quot;I Come Undone&quot;, which was ultimately not officially released.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; is a dance-pop and teen pop record, that mainly consists of teen pop songs. Its music also incorporates other genres such as bubblegum pop, R&amp;B, soul, hip hop and ballads. Beth Johnson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared the album&#x27;s musical styles to those of Tiffany and Whitney Houston. Aguilera herself called it &quot;a pop/R&amp;B album, but I have a lot of soul, (...) there&#x27;s some rangy vocals,&quot; adding that it &quot;got everything, from mid-tempos, to up-tempos, to really big ballads.&quot;

The record opens with &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, which uses sexual references to talk about self-respect. &quot;Billboard&quot; editor Kenneth Partridge wrote that the song features &quot;32nd-note bass-drum pattern that mimics the heart palpitations of a teenager in lust.&quot; &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is a hybrid of teen pop and R&amp;B which lyrically &quot;[reveals] an independent, strong woman who knows what she wants from a relationship, both sexually and emotionally.&quot; The cover version of All-4-One&#x27;s ballad &quot;I Turn to You&quot; is a soul-influenced track. On the song, Aguilera thanks someone for their &quot;faith, strength, support, commitment and tenderness&quot;.

&quot;So Emotional&quot;, &quot;Love for All Seasons&quot; and &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Somebody&quot; incorporate strong elements of R&amp;B and soul. &quot;So Emotional&quot; is a midtempo gospel-inspired number talking about a man who has got Aguilera &quot;on the ropes&quot;. &quot;Love for All Seasons&quot; is a pop track which is musically similar to Carey&#x27;s &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; (1996), while &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Somebody&quot;, in which Aguilera sings about being secure in one&#x27;s arms, features drums snap, bass pops, and a gospel organ in the bridge. Aguilera sings about a woman longing to reveal her true self on &quot;Reflection&quot;, which Partridge characterized it as the song that &quot;sums up the album&quot;. &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot; is deemed the most &quot;sexual&quot; track on &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;, a hip hop-influenced song; the radio mix of the song, released in 2000 as a single, features a rap verse written by Aguilera herself.

&quot;When You Put Your Hands on Me&quot;, an R&amp;B song co-written by Robin Thicke, addresses the alchemy of a sexual intercourse: &quot;I just know / when you put your hands on me / I feel sexy / and my body turns to gold.&quot; &quot;Blessed&quot; features elements of gospel, while &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; features an R&amp;B groove and was compared to Carey&#x27;s songs &quot;Emotions&quot; (1991) and &quot;Dreamlover&quot; (1993). On the final song, &quot;Obvious&quot;, Aguilera wonders whether her confusion about her life is apparent to everyone.

== Release and promotion ==

&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; was released on August 24, 1999, in the United States by RCA Records. Aguilera made many appearances on television shows in order to promote the album, such as &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; and &quot;TRL&quot;. Additionally, she performed &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; at the 1999 Teen Choice Awards. In December 1999, a full-length home video titled &quot;Genie Gets Her Wish&quot; was released. The video includes interviews with her from backstage, in the studio and on the road, also featuring Aguilera&#x27;s rendition of Mel Torme&#x27;s Yuletide classic &quot;The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)&quot;. Later on, in 2000, Aguilera performed at the Super Bowl XXXIV as a halftime performer. Aguilera also attended the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, where she and Fred Durst performed together. Aguilera performed &quot;Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;, wearing a tight ruby red outfit with black and red streaks in her hair, and near the end, Durst walked onstage and performed part of his band Limp Bizkit&#x27;s song &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot; with Aguilera. After eliciting charged reactions from his fans, Durst stated: &quot;I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man.&quot; Aguilera denied Durst&#x27;s statement, saying Durst &quot;got no nookie&quot;. During late 2000, Aguilera traveled to Brazil to promote the album, where she did many interviews and performances on Brazilian television, including &quot;Domingão do Faustão&quot;, &quot;Programa Raul Gil&quot; and &quot;Planeta Xuxa&quot;.

On April 28, 2000, Aguilera announced her first tour, titled Christina Aguilera in Concert, which commenced on July 31, 2000, and went on to visit 37 cities, with a total of 81 shows. The tour was sponsored by Sears and Levi&#x27;s. Aguilera released a statement about the tour, saying: &quot;Headlining my own tour means creative control and a high-energy, let-loose show. It&#x27;s designed with my band and dancers to be a visually exciting mix of my big hits and some special surprises&quot;, adding: &quot;Plus, my sponsors, Sears and Levi&#x27;s, are giving fans lots of ways to get involved with the tour, like exclusive CDs and posters, a chance to win a backstage pass to hang with me and a cause-related program called &#x27;Come On Over and Do Something&#x27; that was created specifically for the tour.&quot; About the tour&#x27;s setlist, she claimed: &quot;I&#x27;ll be doing songs from my debut album. But I&#x27;ve changed so much from doing that at 17, so we&#x27;ll put a whole new twist on things from my album. ... There will be a lot of blues and soul inflections, which is what I&#x27;ve wanted to do more of for a long time.&quot; One feature of the shows she described involved getting the crowd excited with her hit &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; and then switching to a piano-and-vocal-only song by her idol, blues legend Etta James.

In October 2000, the album was reissued as the Special edition, released as a double CD, with the second disc consisting of the dance remixes of the album&#x27;s first three singles, in addition to the remix of &quot;Genio Atrapado&quot; (the Spanish version of &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;), the new song &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Love You&quot;, originally released as the album&#x27;s Japanese bonus track, and the radio remix of &quot;Come on Over Baby (All I Want is You)&quot;. The new edition was released with the new cover artwork, which uses a still from the &quot;Come on Over Baby&quot; music video, edited in the same style as the cover art for her follow-up Spanish album, &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;, released a month before. In Japan, the reissue was released on a single disc and titled as &quot;Remix Plus&quot; edition, because in this country the new material consists only of remixes, as &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Love You&quot; was already included in Japanese standard edition.

=== 20th anniversary ===
In August 2019, Aguilera announced the re-release of &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; in order to commemorate its 20th anniversary. The album was reissued on cassette and picture disc on October 4, while its double-disc reissue had been made available for digital download and streaming on August 23. Furthermore, the orange-colored vinyl edition was released exclusively at Urban Outfitters on August 23.

=== 25th anniversary ===
In September 2024, for the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Aguilera released a &quot;Spotify Anniversaries&quot; special EP with &quot;live-in-the-studio reimagined versions&quot; of the songs &quot;Come on Over&quot;, &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; with Machine Gun Kelly, &quot;Obvious&quot;, &quot;I Turn to You&quot;, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; with Sabrina Carpenter and &quot;Reflection&quot;. In December, it was named one of the best albums of 2024 by &quot;HuffPost&quot;.

== Singles ==
&quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; was the lead single of the album, released on May 11, 1999. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the song for being pleasant, sweet, the album&#x27;s best moment and her signature track. It became one of Aguilera&#x27;s highest-charting singles, getting certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song became an overnight hit and Aguilera&#x27;s first number-one single. It topped the charts for five consecutive weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to strong physical CD sales and airplay, having the longest stay at number one of 1999. The single made airplay history, becoming one of the most successful airplay-only singles and topped the charts weeks before its accompanying music video was made. It also topped the charts in eight countries, while it charted within the top five in every country it was released in. Its music video was a success, becoming a staple on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live and featuring Aguilera enjoying some fun and sexual tension at a beach bonfire. The song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. A version of the song in Spanish, entitled &quot;Genio Atrapado&quot;, was recorded and included in some editions of &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; and later on her Spanish-language album &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;. It peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart, and received a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 1st Latin Grammy Awards.

&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; was released as the second single. Instead of the slower version, Aguilera insisted that a more upbeat mix, with an R&amp;B edge, needed to be created to be released as a single. Released on October 29, 1999, to radio stations, the song received positive reviews from critics, with most praising her vocals on the track, comparing them to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on January 15, 2000, staying atop the chart for two weeks. It ended the chart reign of Santana&#x27;s &quot;Smooth&quot; and became Aguilera&#x27;s second number-one single. The single also topped the charts in New Zealand and Spain, while peaking at number three in the United Kingdom, at number five in Australia and reaching the top 20 in most countries it charted in. The song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards held on February 21, 2001. A Spanish version entitled &quot;Una Mujer&quot; was also recorded and included on &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;.

&quot;I Turn to You&quot; was serviced to US radio on March 28, 2000, as the third single. It received mixed reviews from critics, who recognized that the track allowed Aguilera&#x27;s vocals to soar and shine, but called it a cliché ballad. However, the single peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks, becoming Aguilera&#x27;s third consecutive top-three hit. The single also reached the top ten in Canada, the top 20 in other three countries, including the UK, and the top 40 elsewhere. The music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and features Aguilera singing in front of a microphone before walking in the rain with an umbrella, and on a rooftop. The video&#x27;s storyline follows a young woman getting into an accident, with her mother worriedly waiting for word on where she is at the late hour. A Spanish version entitled &quot;Por Siempre Tu&quot; was released and included on &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;. It peaked at number six on the Hot Latin Songs chart, becoming Aguilera&#x27;s first top-ten Spanish single.

On May 27, 2000, during an interview with &quot;Jam! Canoe&quot; Stephanie McGrath, Aguilera revealed plans to release at least two more singles from her debut–&quot;Come On Over (All I Want Is You)&quot; as soon as &quot;I Turn to You&quot; &quot;runs its toll&quot;, and &quot;So Emotional&quot; that fall. &quot;So Emotional&quot; indeed had a simple music video, which was made available through Aguilera&#x27;s Vevo account in 2009, showing her in a casual outfit recording the song in the studio. However, the song was never released as a single. &quot;Come On Over (All I Want Is You)&quot; was, indeed, chosen as the fourth single. For the song&#x27;s release, Aguilera claimed: &quot;We&#x27;re going to head back in the studio, give it more of an edge, R&amp;B it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there.&quot; The reworked version, entitled &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;, features more hip hop and dance elements as well as &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;sexual&quot; lyrics, even a rap by Aguilera. It was released on July 11, 2000, as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single. The song&#x27;s new version received mixed reviews, with some criticizing the fact that the track &quot;was more like an album track than a hit&quot;, but praised the catchy chorus. However, the song was a success on the charts, becoming Aguilera&#x27;s third number-one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, spending four weeks at the top, from October 8 to November 4, 2000. It spent 21 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, was ranked at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 year-end chart of 2000, and was eventually certified gold by the RIAA. It was also a success internationally, reaching the top ten in countries including Australia, Canada and the UK. Its music video was considered &quot;bright and colorful&quot;, with green, white, and gold backgrounds juxtaposed against a dance choreography. Its Spanish version, entitled &quot;Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tú)&quot;, became a number-one hit on the Hot Latin Songs chart, becoming her first Spanish chart-topper.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the songwriting and the &quot;clean and uncluttered&quot; production on the project. He eventually commended on Aguilera&#x27;s vocals, writing that &quot;she not only has charisma, she can actually sing, bringing conviction to these love and heartbreak songs.&quot; Although calling it &quot;a frustratingly erratic album&quot;, Beth Johnson from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Christina still makes a credible bid to be the late-summer soundtrack to romantic rebound.&quot; Sputnikmusic editor Amanda Murray wrote that &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; &quot;is an album that is highly representative of the better aspects of the teen pop movement of the late 90s.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reporter David E. Thigpen shared a similar sentiment, noting that the album &quot;shows off her [Aguilera&#x27;s] range&quot;, and wrote that the singer&#x27;s &quot;crystalline&quot; voice, &quot;full of wonderful shadings&quot;, &quot;sets her apart in the overhyped teen market&quot;. A reviewer writing for &quot;Q&quot; said the album &quot;shows off her pretty, but powerful vocals to surprisingly impressive effect.&quot; Ann Powers on behalf of &quot;The New York Times&quot; agreed, writing: &quot;Beyond its sleek design, this album hints at a real singer&#x27;s emergence. She has striking vocal power and range, if not a clue about expressing individuality.&quot;

Barry Walters from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the album&#x27;s theme, calling it &quot;bubble-brained&quot;, writing that they &quot;give Aguilera little substance to spin into gold.&quot; Robert Christgau said, &quot;like LeAnn and unlike Britney, Christina already has &#x27;adult&#x27; grit and phrasing down pat, and so threatens to join Gloria, Mariah, Celine, and LeAnn herself in the endless parade of Diane Warren-fueled divas-by-fiat hitting high notes and signifying less than nothing.&quot; Julene Snyder of Sonicnet wrote that &quot;Aguilera has an instinctive grasp of the insipid state of the pop/dance music scene, especially as it relates to her peers.&quot; On behalf of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Nikki Tranter said &quot;there are lots of &#x27;oohs&#x27; and plenty of &#x27;ahhs&#x27; and just enough &#x27;I wants&#x27; and &#x27;you likes&#x27; to keep the kids happy.&quot; Partridge deemed the project &quot;quite listenable&quot;; however, he said the lyrics &quot;tell us precious little about the girl on the cover.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; has also been noted as Aguilera&#x27;s launch into stardom and has earned her numerous awards and achievements. Aguilera was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2000 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, the latter being for &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;. She won the former. Jason Lipshutz of &quot;Billboard&quot; cited her Grammy win as one of her &quot;10 Biggest Career Moments&quot;, describing it as &quot;the battle for teen pop supremacy&quot; as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were both nominated for the Best New Artist prize. Aguilera told the audience at the ceremony that she did not have a speech prepared for the event because she didn&#x27;t think she would win. Aguilera has since taken home four more Grammys, for the songs &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man&quot;, and &quot;Say Something&quot; respectively.

Aguilera also received a Grammy nomination in 2001 for &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; in the &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&quot; category, and according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;both of which helped catapult the album to the top of the charts&quot;. Aguilera&#x27;s Grammy Award nominations, two back to back number-one singles, magazine gossip, and merchandise released under her name made her the &quot;It girl&quot;, according to &quot;People&quot;.

&quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, reached number one and Aguilera became the third female artist in 1999 to top the Hot 100 chart with her debut single, behind Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;. The success of the follow-up single, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; solidified Aguilera as a strong musical force and earned her several accolades, including five MTV Video Music Awards nominations. With the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;, Aguilera managed to have three number-one singles for the same album and four top-ten singles, an achievement she only did with her first album.


== Commercial performance ==
In the United States, &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 252,800 copies, beating Puff Daddy&#x27;s &quot;Forever&quot;. In its second week, it fell to number two, selling 218,000 copies. The album was certified octuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding shipments of eight million copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 8,300,000 copies in the US as of August 2019 and, according to the RIAA, is among the most certified albums of all time.

The album stayed on the UK Albums Chart for a total of 26 weeks. It was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales of one million copies in Europe. In Australia, the album debuted at number 31 on February 20, 2000, initially peaking at number 26 two weeks later and exiting the ARIA album chart after 15 weeks. However, it re-entered the chart at number 25 on October 29, and two weeks later reached a new peak of number 21, spending 13 further weeks on the chart, bringing a total to 28. It was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for 70,000 sales in 2000. In New Zealand, the album debuted at number 38 on October 31, 1999, and later climbed to number 27, before re-entering twice: on November 28 and February 13, 2000. After the latter re-entry, the album peaked at number five on March 26. It re-entered six additional times and was certified platinum by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ), selling over 15,000 copies. In Brazil, the album sold 80,000 copies within seven months of release. It remains Aguilera&#x27;s best-selling album with sales of over 14 million copies worldwide.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; has played an important role on Aguilera&#x27;s legacy and the entertainment industry. In March 2000, Lori Majewski, entertainment director at &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine, stated that &quot;If people want to know why Christina is going to be around a decade from now, the answer is very clear: It&#x27;s pure talent&quot;, Majewski said. &quot;When you hear this girl open her mouth, everyone is astounded. I&#x27;ve seen her sing many times, and every time, I&#x27;m impressed, but the people who are hearing it for the first time can&#x27;t even believe it.&quot; In an article about the &quot;2013 Most Influential People in the World&quot;, in which Aguilera appeared, Canadian singer Celine Dion stated: &quot;I remember she broke onto the scene at the turn of the millennium, ... so I got to watch a lot of her TV appearances, especially on the award shows. I remember thinking, this girl&#x27;s got it all and then some! Unbelievable voice, great dancer and so very beautiful.&quot; The album was included on the List of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The album has been noted to have a &quot;powerful legacy&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Kenneth Partridge called Aguilera a &quot;soul diva working within record-label constraints&quot; and that while he found that the &quot;teen-queen sold truckloads of records (&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; yielded an astounding three number-one singles), in those early years, she struggled to assert her personality&quot;. He added that Aguilera would later do this in her follow-up album &quot;Stripped&quot;. He went on to praise the album saying that it is &quot;a solid set of Top 40 pop songs, and even its deep cuts remain quite listenable&quot;. In an interview with Kelly Clarkson, Aguilera herself has stated that &quot;Authenticity is very important to [her] with [her] music&quot;. She went on to say that she &quot;always wanted to a be a truth-seeker, and [she] found that that was really important to my fans too&quot;.

&quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; was listed at number 38 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s, About.com placed it at number two on her &quot;Top 10 Songs&quot;, while AOL Radio ranked it at number one, calling it her &quot;signature song&quot;. While listing the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed Aguilera at number 52, picking &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; as one of her &quot;key tracks&quot;, writing that &quot;Even in her teen-pop days, she was modeling her dramatic, melismatic technique on old-school soul heroines like Etta James&quot;. The song was also covered by contestants of many popular talent shows such as &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;The Voice&quot;. &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; inspired the title of the 2000 romantic comedy film &quot;What Women Want&quot;, having the track on its soundtrack and on a scene. It also inspired the title of the 2003 comedy film of the same name. American singer Lady Gaga has called Aguilera&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Turn to You&quot; an inspiration, as she stated: &quot;When I was 15, I was singing &#x27;I Turn to You&#x27; at the top of my lungs trying to hit all her notes. So she was an inspiration to me to have a wider vocal range.&quot;

<text>Fussballclub Zürich, commonly abbreviated to FC Zürich or simply FCZ, is a professional football club based in Zurich, Switzerland. The club was founded in 1896 and has won the Swiss Super League 13 times and the Swiss Cup ten times. Their most recent titles are the 2022 Swiss Super League and the 2018 Swiss Cup. The club plays its home games at the Letzigrund, which has a capacity of 26,000 for league games.

FC Zürich is the only Swiss team to have reached the semi-finals of the European Cup more than once. This happened in 1964 and 1977, when the competition was played in its original format. FC Zürich co-founder, first captain and honorary member Joan Gamper, who grew up in Zurich and later moved to Catalonia, founding Barcelona there in 1899. Since the 1960s, FC Zürich plays in all-white, which is one of the city&#x27;s colours.

The women&#x27;s club, FC Zürich Frauen, are competing in the Swiss Women&#x27;s Super League. They are the most successful club in Switzerland with 22 championship titles and multiple Champions League participations. The team&#x27;s roots originate from the first Swiss women&#x27;s football club, DFC Zürich.

== History ==
=== 1896–1924 ===
The club was founded in summer 1896 by former members of the two local clubs: FC Turicum and FC Excelsior. Later, the official founding date was set at 1 August 1896. One of the founding members was the later Barcelona founder, Joan Gamper, coaching and playing for FC Excelsior and its successor from 1894 to 1897. The new club played its first game on 30 August 1896 on Velorennbahn Hardau in Zürich against St. Gallen, which resulted in a 3–3 draw. In 1898, FC Excelsior merged with FC Zürich, and local club FC Victoria joined shortly thereafter.

The debut game was in 1896 with the colours blue and white. The colours were changed to red and white because rivals Grasshoppers had the same colours. When Grasshoppers temporarily retired from the championship in 1909, FCZ returned to the colors blue and white, which they continue to use. Zürich won its first title in the Swiss Serie A in 1901–02, but did not win it again until 1923–24.

Until the 1930s, the club&#x27;s sporting remit included rowing, boxing, athletics and handball, but football would become the focus of the club.

=== 1925–1960 ===

Zürich struggled to overcome an unsuccessful record and was described as the &quot;wilderness years&quot; from 1925 to 1960. They were relegated in 1933–34, playing in the 1. Liga until the 1941 season. In 1940–41, they returned to the Nationalliga, where they stayed until their relegation in 1945–46. They were back in the Nationalliga A in 1947–48 and stayed in the top flight until relegated in 1956–57. They were promoted from the Nationalliga B to contest the 1958–59 Nationalliga A, finishing in third place.

=== 1960–1981 ===
This period was known as the &quot;Golden Years&quot; by the FCZ faithful. At this time, the club was run by the president Edwin Nägeli and had players such as Köbi Kuhn, Fritz Künzli, Ilija Katić, René Botteron and many more. Zürich won seven championships in the years 1963, 1966, 1968, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1981. They also won the Swiss Cup five times: in 1966, 1970, 1972, 1973 and 1976. FCZ also had much success internationally in reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup 1963–64, before losing to Real Madrid and also reaching the semi-finals in the European Cup 1976–77, where they lost to Liverpool.

=== 1981–2005 ===
Following the club&#x27;s league title in 1981, the club went into a decline, and in 1988 they were relegated to the Nationalliga B. Zürich returned to the top league in 1990. The club did make it to last 16 of the UEFA Cup 1998–99, but were beaten by Roma. The club won the Swiss Cup in 2000, beating Lausanne in the final. They won it again in 2005, beating Luzern.

=== 2006–2016 ===

On 13 May 2006, FCZ ended their 25-year effort to win Super League with a goal in the 93rd minute by Iulian Filipescu against Basel. The goal gave FCZ a 2–1 victory based on goal difference. They retained the title in 2006–07.

In 2008, the local women&#x27;s team, FFC Zürich Seebach, was combined with FC Zürich and played in the Swiss national league under the name FC Zürich Frauen.

In the 2007–08 season, FCZ finished in third place. In a 2008–09 season match, they edged pass Young Boys to win the league title. In 2009, they made their debut play in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. In the 2010–11 season, FCZ finished second. The following seasons, they finished mostly in mid-table positions. FCZ won the Swiss Cup 2014 in extra time against Basel 2–0.

In the 2015–16 season, the club finished last, one point behind Lugano and was relegated to the Swiss Challenge League. Four days after the final game of the season, FCZ won the Swiss Cup 2016 beating Lugano 1–0.

=== Recent years ===

In the 2016–17 season, FC Zürich won the Challenge League ahead of Neuchâtel Xamax, and returned after one year to the Super League. In the 2017–2018 season they finished fourth. On 27 May 2018 they won the Swiss Cup for the tenth time, beating Young Boys 2–1.

In the 2021–2022 season, FC Zürich won the Super League again after an interruption of 13 years. The club secured its 13th league title with a 2–0 away win over Basel, who finished second, on 1 May 2022, with five rounds to go. Despite this success, coach André Breitenreiter departed the club to join Bundesliga side TSG Hoffenheim on 24 May 2022. On 8 June 2022, former Austrian national coach Franco Foda was announced as the coach for the upcoming season. Despite being able to guide Zürich into the Europa League group stages, the domestic campaign saw the side gain only two points out of a possible 24 in their title defence. The league form, combined with a shock cup defeat to Challenge League side Lausanne on 18 September, proved the final straw and Foda was sacked on 21 September.

In 2024, Ricardo Moniz was appointed head coach on a two-year contract.

== Rivalries ==
Grasshoppers, also from Zürich, and Basel are the main rivals of FCZ. Due to the intense rivalry, these matches are so-called high-risk fixtures, with an increased police presence in and around the stadium.

=== Zürich ===
Since its inception, FCZ has always had a fiery relationship with neighbouring club Grasshopper over sporting supremacy in the city.

To date, 251 official derbies have been held, with Grasshoppers leading with 121 wins to FC Zurich&#x27;s 90, leaving 39 draws. However, since the reformation of the Swiss Super League in 2003, FCZ has frequently gotten the better of their city rivals, winning 33 out of 68 games (GC won 20 and 15 draws).

The October 2011 derby at Letzigrund was abandoned by the referee after rioting by FC Zürich fans. Earlier in the day, Grasshopper Club Zürich fans stole FC Zürich fan banners and displayed them with a message mocking FC Zürich. 

=== Final vs. Basel, 13 May 2006 ===

Before the last round of the 2005–06 Swiss Super League, Zürich were three points behind Basel in the league table. The last game of the season was contested by these two clubs vying for the league title at St. Jakob Park, Basel. Alhassane Keita scored the match first goal, for Zürich. In the second half, Mladen Petrić equalised. Basel were seconds away from the title when, in the 93rd minute, Florian Stahel passed the ball to Iulian Filipescu, who scored. Zürich&#x27;s success at 2 – 1 was attributed to their superior goal difference. Following the final whistle, Basel supporters stormed the pitch and attacked players on both teams.

==Infrastructure==
In 2010, the youth and women&#x27;s teams of the club moved their homebase to the Heerenschürli sport park in the city quarter of Hirzenbach where the academy and women&#x27;s teams play also their home matches. In June 2022, the club moved with the opening of a newly built &quot;House of FCZ&quot; also their Super League team and offices there in order to have the whole organisation under one roof.

<doc id="555350" wikidata="Q827156" url="?curid=555350" title="Shift key">
<text>The Shift key is a modifier key on a keyboard, used to type capital letters and other alternate &quot;upper&quot; characters. There are typically two Shift keys, on the left and right sides of the row below the home row. The Shift key&#x27;s name originated from the typewriter, where one had to press and hold the button to shift up the case stamp to change to capital letters;
the Shift key was first used in the Remington No. 2 Type-Writer of 1878; the No. 1 model was capital-only.

On the US layout and similar keyboard layouts, characters that typically require the use of the Shift key include the parentheses, the question mark, the exclamation point, and the colon.

When the Caps Lock key is engaged, the Shift key may be used to type lowercase letters on many operating systems, though not on macOS or on Microsoft Windows keyboard layouts that have the SGCAPS feature.

==Labeling==

The keyboard symbol for the Shift key (which is called Level 2 Select key in the international standard series ISO/IEC 9995) is given in ISO/IEC 9995-7 as symbol 1, and in ISO 7000 &quot;“Graphical symbols for use on equipment”&quot; as a directional variant of the symbol ISO-7000-251. In Unicode 6.1, the character approximating this symbol best is U+21E7 (⇧). This symbol is commonly used to denote the Shift key on modern keyboards (especially on non-US layouts and on the Apple Keyboard), sometimes in combination with the word &quot;Shift&quot; or its translation in the local language. This symbol also is used in texts to denote the Shift key.
==Uses on computer keyboards==
On computer keyboards, as opposed to typewriter keyboards, the Shift key can have many more uses:

* It is sometimes used to modify the function keys. Modern Microsoft Windows keyboards typically have only 12 function keys; Shift+F1 must be used to type F13, Shift+F2 for F14, etc.
* It can modify various control and alt keys. For example, if Alt-Tab is used to cycle through open windows, Shift-Alt-Tab cycles in the reverse order, and using Ctrl-Shift-S could open a &quot;Save as…&quot; dialogue allowing to choose a new file name and directory instead of overwriting the current file.
* In most graphical systems using a mouse and keyboard, the Shift key can be used to select a range. For example, if a file is selected in a list, Shift-clicking on a file further down the list will select the files clicked on plus the ones in between. Similarly, when editing text a Shift-click will select the text between the click point and the text cursor.
* The Shift key can be used in conjunction with the arrow keys to select text.
* Holding Shift while drawing with the mouse in graphics programs generally confines the shape to a straight line, usually vertically or horizontally, or to draw squares and circles using the rectangle and ellipse tools, respectively.
* The Shift key can also be used to modify the mouse behavior on a computer. For example, holding Shift while clicking on a link in a web browser might cause the page to open in a new window, or to be downloaded.
* In some web browsers, holding Shift while scrolling will scan through previously viewed web pages.
* In mostly Pinyin Input Method, Shift key usually use to switch between Chinese and lowercase English.
* In older versions of macOS (10.12 Sierra and below), holding while performing certain actions, such as minimising a window or enabling/disabling Dashboard or Mission Control, makes the animation occur in slow motion. For some animations, holding will make the animation move just slightly slower, and holding will result in an extremely slow-motion animation.
* Pressing either Shift key when the screen is blank or the computer is asleep will wake the computer.

On some keyboards, if both Shift keys are held down simultaneously only some letters can be typed. For example, on the Dell keyboard Model RT7D20 only 16 letters can be typed. This phenomenon is known as &quot;masking&quot; and is a fundamental limitation of the way the keyboard electronics are designed.

==Windows specific==
The following is a list of actions involving the Shift key for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

<doc id="555351" wikidata="Q2784503" url="?curid=555351" title="Progressive Party (South Africa)">
<text>The Progressive Party () was a liberal party in South Africa which, during the era of apartheid, was considered the left wing of the all-white parliament. The party represented the legal opposition to apartheid within South Africa&#x27;s white minority. It opposed the ruling National Party&#x27;s racial policies, and championed the rule of law. For 13 years, its only member of parliament was Helen Suzman. It was later renamed the Progressive Reform Party in 1975, and then Progressive Federal Party in 1977. The modern Democratic Alliance considers the party to be its earliest predecessor.

The Progressive Party of South Africa is not to be confused with the much earlier Progressive Party of the Cape Colony, which was founded on very different, pro-imperialist policies and which became the &quot;Union Party&quot; in 1908.

==Creation==

The Progressive Party was formed by members who had left the United Party following the United Party Union Congress held in Bloemfontein starting on 11 August 1959. The delegates at the Party Congress passed policy resolutions limiting the political rights the party wished to give to Natives. The Progressives found these resolutions unacceptable.

Dissatisfied with the supine stance of the United Party to the apartheid policies of the Government, twelve liberal members of the United Party broke away to form the Progressive Party in 1959. The party rejected race discrimination and advocated equal opportunities for all with a qualified franchise with a common voter&#x27;s roll.

A Progressive Group of MPs led by Dr Bernard Friedman, organized the new party. The first meeting of the Group took place at the home of Helen Suzman, MP for the Transvaal seat of Houghton. This meeting took place on 23–24 August 1959. The Progressive Party began its founding Congress on 13 November 1959, in Johannesburg.

Jan Steytler, a former Cape leader of the United Party, was elected the first leader of the new Party.

At the session of Parliament in 1960, the Progressive Party had twelve MPs. Eleven had been first elected for the United Party and one (a Native Representative Member) defected from the Liberal Party of South Africa. By the end of that Parliament in 1961, the group had been reduced to ten as a result of the abolition of the Native Representative seats at the end of 1960 and the resignation of one MP in January 1961.

==Electoral history==

At the General Election, held on 18 October 1961, the Progressive Party performed relatively well for a new party, putting up a credible performance against the United Party in many of the seats it contested, especially in the Transvaal and Natal. However, the electoral system worked to the party&#x27;s disadvantage, and although it came very close in Parktown, Helen Suzman in Houghton was the only Progressive Party candidate to actually be elected. It would be thirteen years before she again had party colleagues in Parliament. In that time Suzman was re-elected in 1966 and 1970. In those years, she singlehandedly did the work of an entire opposition party and would become a well known figure both inside South Africa and abroad.

Following the disappointing result of the election, support for the party amongst white voters had dropped substantially by 1966, and focus instead shifted towards attracting coloured votes. The Progressive Party won two seats representing coloured voters on the Cape Provincial Council in 1965. The National Party responded by extending the term of the four national coloured representative members, and ultimately abolished coloured electoral representation by 1970, thus preventing the party from winning those seats. Despite gains in some white constituencies, Suzman once again became its only MP or MPC.

Jan Steytler continued as party leader until December 1970, but being outside Parliament he was far less visible than Suzman. Harry Lawrence, a former Minister and the most senior of the MPs who had left the United Party in 1959, became temporary leader. In February 1971 Colin Eglin from Cape Town was elected party leader.

At the next General Election, on 24 April 1974, the Progressive Party made a major advance. In addition to Suzman, re-elected for Houghton, five other members won seats including Colin Eglin. A seventh member of the caucus was elected at a by-election soon after. Three members also won seats on the Transvaal and Cape Provincial Councils. This brought the party out of the political wilderness and set it on the path towards becoming the official opposition.
===Election results===
==Merger with Reform Party==
A group of reformists broke away from the left wing of the United Party in February 1975. Four MPs led by Harry Schwarz, formed the Reform Party. The Reform Party merged with the Progressive Party to form the Progressive Reform Party, following Congresses held in Johannesburg on 25 and 26 July 1975.

Subsequently, the PRP merged with another breakaway group from the United Party, which was in sharp decline in the mid 1970s, to become the Progressive Federal Party in 1977.

<text>Radio-Activity (German title: Radio-Aktivität) is the fifth studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk, released in November 1975. The band&#x27;s first entirely electronic album is also a concept album organized around the themes of radioactive decay and radio communication. All releases of the album were bilingual, with lyrics in both English and German. The album was accompanied by single release of the title track, which was successful in France and Belgium.

==Background==
Following the success of its 1974 predecessor &quot;Autobahn&quot;, an album based on Germany&#x27;s eponymous motorway network, Kraftwerk embarked on a tour of the United States with the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of the band formed by Ralf Hütter, Florian Schneider, Karl Bartos—who joined in February 1975—and Wolfgang Flür in April and May 1975.

== Album title ==
&quot;Radio-Activity&quot;&#x27;s album title displays Kraftwerk&#x27;s typical deadpan humour, being a pun on the twin themes of the songs, half being about radioactivity and the other half about activity on the radio. Bartos revealed that the title was inspired by a chart column in the American magazine, &quot;Billboard&quot;, which featured the most played singles under the title &quot;Radio Activity&quot;. According to Wolfgang Flur, the concept arose as a result of the many radio interviews that Ralf and Florian had given on their American tour.

== Composition and recording ==
The album was recorded in Kling Klang Studio, Düsseldorf, and it was self-produced by Hütter and Schneider. It was their first purely electronic album, and the first one to be performed by the &quot;classic&quot; band line-up. Karl and Wolfgang worked on electronic percussion. LP liner notes state music and production was by Hütter and Schneider, with Emil Schult collaborating on lyrics. For this album, the band had decided to record some vocals in English and Schult&#x27;s command of the language after studying for a while in the United States was better than Hutter&#x27;s or Schneider&#x27;s. Tim Barr pointed out the impact his experiences had in the United States on his ability to speak the language and in more subtle ways as well. Schult also designed the artwork, which was based on a late-1930s &#x27;Deutscher Kleinempfänger&#x27; radio.

The overture instrumental piece &quot;Geiger Counter&quot; used Geiger counter beats based on musique concrète. The album featured use of the distinctive Vako Orchestron keyboard to provide vocal choir on title track. &quot;Antenna&quot; used an echo chamber effect, and Hütter&#x27;s Farfisa electronic piano was used on &quot;Transistor&quot;. For the recording, extensive use was made of the vocoder.

== Release and promotion ==
In September 1975, the band toured the UK, playing 17 shows. By 1975, Hütter and Schneider&#x27;s previous publishing deals with Capriccio Music and Star Musik Studio of Hamburg had expired. The compositions on &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; were published by their own newly set up &quot;Kling Klang Verlag&quot; music publishing company, giving them greater financial control over the use of songwriting output. Also, the album was the first to bear the fruit of Kling Klang as an established vanity label under the group&#x27;s new licensing deal with EMI. 

&quot;Radio-Activity&quot; was released in November 1975. For their promotion, their record company sent them to a &quot;real Atomkraftwerk&quot; to take promotional photos. In these photos, the group was dressed in white protective suits and anti-radiation boots on their shoes. The album reached on the Canadian charts in February 1976. The title track &quot;Radioactivity&quot; was released as a single in May 1976 and became a hit in France, selling 500,000 copies, and Belgium in the charts.

== Reception ==

&quot;Radio-Activity&quot; was released to mixed reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticizing the album: &quot;...no cut on the album comes near the melodic/harmonic sense that pervaded &quot;Autobahn&quot; or the creative use of electronics on the much earlier album &quot;Ralf and Florian&quot;&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote regarding their 2009 remaster that it &quot;begins like a heartbeat in the void, accelerating into the pulse that will form the spine of the title-song, an eerie tribute to the intangibles (music, disintegrating atoms) that linger in the atmosphere.&quot; It consider that &quot;has a musty scent of Old Europe, which proved a hit with the synth groups of 1980-81 (eg, Ultravox and Visage), and it retains a blood-chilling, Wagnerian quality even now, thanks to Kraftwerk&#x27;s use of the Vako Orchestron, a choir-like relative of the Mellotron.&quot; 

Chris Power from &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; praised it for the experimental feeling in 2009: &quot;A bridge between electronic experimentalism and the powerful, groundbreaking unification of avant-garde form and catchy, commercial function that was just around the corner, &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; is the sound of Kraftwerk finding their way in a strange new landscape that they were in the very process of creating&quot;. In a retrospective review, Jason Ankeny from AllMusic called the album &quot;a pivotal record in the group&#x27;s continuing development&quot; and stated that it &quot;marked Kraftwerk&#x27;s return to more obtuse territory, extensively utilizing static, oscillators, and even Cage-like moments of silence&quot;.

<text>The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) was established as a media unit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in February 1964. It was a member of the International Federation of Film Archives.

In March 2022, it was merged with National Film Development Corporation.

== Objectives ==
Its three principal objectives are: to trace, acquire and preserve for posterity the heritage of Indian cinema; to classify, document data and undertake research relating to films; to act as a centre for the dissemination of film culture.

== Organization ==
With headquarters at Pune, Maharashtra, NFAI had three regional offices at Bangalore, Calcutta and Thiruvananthapuram. Developed from scratch by P. K. Nair, NFAI&#x27;s activities related to the dissemination of film culture were manifold. Its distribution library consists of about 25 active members throughout the country and it also organizes joint screening programmes on a weekly, fortnightly and monthly basis in six important centres. The archive contains over 10,000 films, over 10,000 books, over 10,000 film scripts, and over 50,000 photographs. Another important programme conducted by the archive is the film teaching scheme comprising long and short-term film appreciation courses conducted in collaboration with the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and other educational and cultural institutions. At the international level, NFAI has supplied several Indian classics for major screening programmes.

The NFAI&#x27;s archive keeps a stock of films, video cassettes, DVDs, books, posters, stills, press clippings, slides, audio CDs, and disc records of Indian cinema dating back to the 1910s.

== State of preservation ==
On 8 January 2003, a large fire caused a massive destruction in the vault of NFAI housed in the Prabhat Studio complex of FTII in Pune, in which unduplicated irreplaceable films with a nitrate base were destroyed. Ravi Shankar Prasad the then Minister of State, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India announced in the Rajya Sabha that 607 films in 5,097 reels were lost in the fire. Among the greatest loss were films by Dadasaheb Phalke including: &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; (1913), &quot;Lanka Dahan&quot; (1917) and &quot;Kaliya Mardan&quot; (1919). Important films produced by Prabhat Film Company, Wadia Movietone, Bombay Talkies and New Theatres, were also gutted, namely: &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot; (1932), &quot;Amar Jyoti&quot; (1936), &quot;Manoos&quot; (1939), &quot;Aage Badho&quot; (1947) and others.

In March 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India reported that 31,000 reels at the NFAI were reported lost or destroyed, when it audited the records between May 1, 2015, and September 30, 2017.

<text>Num Lock or Number Lock (⇭) is a key on the numeric keypad of most computer keyboards. It is a lock key, like Caps Lock and Scroll Lock. Its state affects the function of the numeric keypad commonly located to the right of the main keyboard and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.

The Num Lock key exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have cursor control or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had different number keys and cursor control keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to select between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the Num Lock key is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the Num Lock key is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.

Since Apple keyboards never had a combination of arrow keys and numeric keypad (but some lacked arrow keys, function keys, and a numeric keypad altogether), Apple has keyboards with a separate numeric keypad but no functional Num Lock key. Keyboards manufactured by Apple will instead use a &quot;Clear&quot; key but not all Apple manufactured keyboards will be provided with it.

<text>The Ashanti–Fante War (1806–1807) was a war fought between the Ashanti Empire and the Fante Confederacy in the region of what is currently the Republic of Ghana.

== Background and the course of the war ==
In 1806, the Asantehene, Osei Bonsu, brought charges of grave robbing on some of his subjects who ran from Kumasi to Assin. Fleeing Ashanti lands, these suspected grave robbers were granted refuge by the Fante. Osei Bonsu sent out envoys to the Fante state of Abura for harboring fugitives. The last envoys were murdered by the Fante. Osei Bonsu declared war in response. The Ashanti sacked Abura in May 1806. The Ashanti later attacked the British fort at Anomabu on 15 June 1807 for protecting the Ashanti fugitives who had fled there. 8000 of the 1500 Fante at Anomabu were slain by 16 June. The Ashanti tried to capture the British fort with significant losses. British governor Torrane surrendered the fort to the Ashanti siege and diplomatic reconciliation took place between Torrane and Osei Bonsu on 25 June. The surviving Fante chiefs swore allegiance to the Asantehene.

==Aftermath of war==

Ashanti–Fante War breaks out

This war, also known as the Ghana War, begins between the Ashanti associate degree Fante Confederacies of present–day Ghana. The Ashanti had resisted any attempt by Europeans, chiefly the British, to colonize them, and aligned themselves with the Dutch to limit British influence within the region. However, the British still annexed neighboring areas, together with the Fante, and also the subsequent conflicts eventually increased into the war of 1806, during which the Ashanti were victorious. In 1811, the Ga–Fante War sees the defeat of the Ashanti, though they still capture a British fort. In 1814 the Ashanti launch an invasion of the Gold Coast, totally routing the tribes allied with the Europeans.

First Anglo-Ashanti War begins
in West Africa 
War begins between the United Kingdom and the Ashanti. With the occurrence of the Ashanti–Fante War in 1806, the groups that had been allied with the Fante people against the Ashanti like the Ga people, leading a series of wars, and the Ashanti, allied with the Dutch, tried to limit European, particularly British power within the region of the Gold Coast. A series of forts were designed by the British Government in the region from 1821 and the Ashanti planned to invade and capture. In 1824 their forces surrounded a smaller army of around 1,000 British troops under the governor of West Africa, General Sir Charles McCarthy (?–1824) at Accra, defeating them and forcing the suicide of a humiliated McCarthy. The series of correct wars between the Fante people and Ashanti begins in 1826, ending with a pact in 1831, however breaking out once more in 1873.

<doc id="555364" wikidata="Q729752" url="?curid=555364" title="Caps Lock">
<text>Caps Lock () is a button on a computer keyboard that causes all letters of bicameral scripts to be generated in capital letters. It is a toggle key: each press reverses the previous action. Some keyboards also implement a light to give visual feedback about whether it is on or off. Exactly what Caps Lock does depends on the keyboard hardware, the operating system, the device driver, and the keyboard layout. Usually, the effect is limited to letter keys. Letters of non-bicameral scripts (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi) and non-letter characters are generated normally.

== History ==
The Caps Lock key originated as a Shift lock key on mechanical typewriters. An early innovation in typewriters was the introduction of a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the typewriter&#x27;s Shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically &quot;shifting&quot; the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.

The Shift lock key was introduced so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and were meant to be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for more than two or three consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the Shift lock key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.

Mechanical typewriter shift lock is typically set by pushing both Shift and lock at the same time, and released by pressing Shift by itself. Computer Caps Lock is set and released by the same key, and the Caps Lock behavior in most QWERTY keyboard layouts differs from the Shift lock behavior in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a Shift lock but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one of which could be enabled at a time.

===Abolition===
There are some proposals to abolish the caps-lock key as being obsolete. Pieter Hintjens, the CEO of iMatix, started a &quot;Capsoff&quot; organization proposing hardware manufacturers delete the Caps Lock key. Google has removed the Caps Lock on the Chromebook keyboard, replacing it with the &quot;Everything Button&quot;; the caps-lock function is then reproduced using an &quot;alt&quot; key combination.

In fact, the current German keyboard layout standard DIN 2137-01:2023-08 (like its preceding edition from 2018) specifies the function of the key as optional, to be replaced by other keys or key combinations. It recommends the function only to be invoked when it is pressed simultaneously with the Control key, while otherwise it acts as a “left AltGr key”, thus enabling touch typists to access all key combinations using AltGr without using two fingers of the same hand, which is considered to be an ergonomic advantage. As a side effect, any inadvertent pressing of this key without pressing another key simultaneously has no effect.

== Behavior ==
Typical Caps Lock behavior is that pressing the key sets an input mode in which all typed letters are uppercase, if applicable. The keyboard remains in Caps Lock mode and would generate all caps text until the key is pressed again. Keyboards often include a small LED to indicate that Caps Lock is active, either on the key itself or in a dedicated indicators area, where Scroll Lock and Num Lock indicators are also located. On the original IBM PC keyboard, this LED was exclusively controlled by the keyboard. Since the introduction of IBM PC/AT, it is under control of the operating system. Small keyboards, such as netbook keyboards, forgo the indicators to conserve space, instead providing software that gives on-screen or audio feedback.

In most cases, the status of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys, not that of any other key. Microsoft Windows enforces this behavior only when a keyboard layout for a Latin-based script is active, e.g. the &quot;English (United States)&quot; layout but not the &quot;Persian&quot; layout. On certain non-QWERTY keyboard layouts, such as the French AZERTY and the German QWERTZ, Caps Lock still behaves like a traditional Shift lock, i.e., the keyboard behaves as if the Shift key is held down, causing the keyboard to input the alternative values of the keys; example the key generates a &quot;%&quot; when is pressed. This is not true for the layout &quot;German (IBM)&quot;.

Depending on the keyboard layout used, the Shift key, when pressed in combination with a Latin-based letter button while Caps Lock is already on, is either ignored, or reverses the effect of Caps Lock, so that typed characters are in lowercase again. Microsoft Windows enforces the latter. RISC OS offers both – Caps Lock alone chooses the former, Shift-Caps Lock the latter.

While the typical locking behavior on keyboards with a key is that of a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in Shift lock mode.

Some keyboard drivers include a configuration option to deactivate the Caps Lock key. This behavior allows users to decide themselves whether they want to use the key, or to disable it to prevent accidental activation.

In the Unix communities of the ex-USSR countries, Caps Lock key is traditionally used as input language switcher, convenient for usage with touch typing. Support for this is present in KDE, GNOME and other desktop environments. Default Russian and Ukrainian layouts for FreeBSD specify Caps Lock as input language switcher. In Microsoft Windows, third-party utilities are needed to enable this behavior. In such configurations, the original Caps Lock function is reached with the combination.

=== Precautions ===
Most apps that request users to input a password do not display it on screen, so as not to expose it to prying eyes. A user who does not pay proper attention to the Caps Lock indicator might type the wrong password (in which all small letters become capital letters or vice versa). As such, help guides, tech support materials, and app user interfaces may include warnings on checking the Caps Lock state before typing a password. In Microsoft Windows login screens, a warning that Caps Lock is on is shown in a balloon near the field. In macOS, when Caps Lock is on, a Caps Lock symbol () is displayed inside a password field.

=== SGCAPS ===
In Microsoft Windows, there are keyboard layouts, such as Swiss German, whose keys generate unrelated, non-uppercase symbols when pressed before ., creating a 5th level (and a 6th level when is on and is pressed) for typing symbols on a single key.

Below is an example using the Swiss German keyboard layout.
* → ü
* → è
* → Ü
* → È

SGCAPS is named after the first keyboard layout to use this feature. (Swiss German CAPS Lock).

== Placement ==

Since its inception, the IBM PC keyboard had a Caps Lock. In the first version for PC/XT, Caps Lock was located to the bottom right of the letter keys area. Subsequent models switched the places of the Caps Lock key and the Control key. As such, Caps Lock has since been placed on left edge of the keyboard, above the Shift key and below the Tab key, next to letter A. This layout has become the &quot;de facto&quot; popular standard.

The keyboards of some early computer terminals, including the Teletype Model 33 ASR and Lear-Siegler ADM-3A, the Apple II, and a few Apple Keyboard models retained the Control key where PC/XT first had it; Caps Lock was either absent on these devices or was placed elsewhere. This layout was preserved for later workstation systems and is often associated with Unix workstations. Keyboards from Sun Microsystems came in two layouts; &quot;Unix&quot; and &quot;PC-style&quot;, with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys. The Amiga computers all had both the Control key and Caps Lock key in this spot at half the width.

Some users of keyboards with Caps Lock on the left remap the keys to exchange Control and Caps Lock, finding the traditional location more ergonomic for using programs benefiting from use of the Control key. Keyboard layout preferences specifically to address this need are available in some operating systems. Some keyboards even provide a switch on the bottom to logically swap the two keys in hardware.

The Happy Hacking Keyboard and the keyboards produced for OLPC XO computers also have the Control key in this location, while not including a Caps Lock. Beginning with the Google Cr-48, Chromebooks have omitted Caps Lock in favor of either a Search button or an &quot;Everything Button&quot;. Holding down Alt and pressing the Everything Button enables Caps Lock, which is enabled until Shift is pressed.

== Observances ==
June 28 and October 22 are semiannually observed as International Caps Lock Day as a parody holiday created in October 2000 by Derek Arnold, a user on MetaFilter. The second observation on June 28 was added by Arnold in memory of American pitchman Billy Mays.

<doc id="555366" wikidata="Q1952198" url="?curid=555366" title="Mullard">
<text>Mullard Limited was a British manufacturer of electronic components. The Mullard Radio Valve Co. Ltd. of Southfields, London, was founded in 1920 by Captain Stanley R. Mullard, who had previously designed thermionic valves (US term: vacuum tube) for the Admiralty before becoming managing director of the Z Electric Lamp Co. The company soon moved to Hammersmith, London and then in 1923 to Balham, London. The head office in later years was Mullard House at 1–19 Torrington Place, Bloomsbury, now part of University College London.

==Start-up==
In 1921, the directors were Sir Ralph Ashton (chairman), Basil Binyon of the Radio Communication Co, C.F. Elwell and S.R. Mullard (managing director).

==Partnership with Philips==
In 1923, to meet the technical demands of the newly formed BBC, Mullard formed a partnership with the Dutch manufacturer Philips. The valves (vacuum tubes) produced in this period were named with the prefix PM, for Philips-Mullard, beginning with the PM3 and PM4 in 1926. Mullard finally sold all its shares to Philips in 1927. In 1928, the company introduced the first pentode valve to the British market.

==Factories==

===Mitcham===
Mullard opened a new manufacturing plant at the end of New Road, Mitcham, Surrey in 1929. A second building was added in 1936. Both buildings had a very distinctive flat roof construction and were very similar to those at Philips&#x27; headquarters in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Co-sited with the Mullard buildings was the manufacturing complex for Philips Radios. Mitcham was also home to the Mullard Application Laboratory.

===Blackburn===
In the late 1930s Philips opened a plant in Blackburn, Lancashire, and during the Second World War some operations were moved there from Mitcham; by the end of the war, nearly 3,000 were employed. Tungsten and molybdenum wire were produced on-site from 1954, and a glass factory was built in 1955. In 1962 over 6,200 were employed and Mullard described the Blackburn works as &quot;the largest valve manufacturing plant in Europe&quot;.

By 1949 Mullard had produced a number of television sets, such as the MTS-521 and MTS-684. In 1951 Mullard was producing the LSD series of photographic flash tubes.

===Others===
Mullard had factories in Southport and Simonstone, both in Lancashire. The latter closed in 2004. There was also a sister factory at Belmont in Durham (closed in June 2005). Other factories included those at Fleetwood (closed in 1979) and Lytham St. Annes (closed in 1972). A feeder factory at Haydock closed in 1981. A small factory in Hove closed in the early 1970s.

==Teletext==

In the early 1980s, Mullard manufactured the SAA5050, one of the first teletext character generator modules made in the UK.

==Semiconductors==

Mullard owned semiconductor factories in Southampton and Hazel Grove, Stockport, Cheshire.

Southampton (Millbrook Trading Estate) was a purpose-built plant, opened in 1957 for the manufacture of semiconductors. Production of germanium alloy transistors was transferred from Mitcham. 
At the same time the plant started the research, development and production of electro optical devices. Fabrication of planar devices on a mass production basis did not begin until 1966, when germanium sales were decreasing. 1967 saw the start of the development and production of integrated circuits. The plant was planned to be the biggest semiconductor facility in Europe, employing 3,000 people including 200 scientists and engineers.

In 1962 Associated Semiconductor Manufacturers (ASM) Ltd was formed by Mullard and GEC to combine the semiconductor development and production facilities of the two companies; Mullard owned two-thirds of the company and included the Southampton plant; GEC contributed their small factory in School Street, Hazel Grove, producing thyristors, rectifiers and power diodes. GEC pulled out of ASM Ltd in 1969.
In 1972 production was moved to a newly constructed factory nearby on Bramhall Moor Lane.

Both sites were later owned by NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors). The Southampton site is now closed. The one in Hazel Grove, Stockport specialises in power semiconductor devices and is now Nexperia Manchester.

The first transistors produced by Mullard were the OC50 and OC51 point-contact types in 1952, which were not widely used. In 1953 Mullard moved to junction transistors, beginning with the plastic-cased OC10 series. These were followed by the glass-encapsulated OC43...47, OC70/71, (released in 1957) and OC80 series (the output devices were metal encapsulated to facilitate heatsinking), which were produced in large numbers and copied by other companies, such as Valvo (another Philips subsidiary) and Siemens in Germany, and Amperex (another Philips subsidiary) in the USA. RF transistors were the OC170 and OC171. All these were germanium PNP transistors. Mullard&#x27;s first silicon transistors were the OC201 to OC207, PNP alloy types using the standard SO-2 metal-over-glass construction such as the OC200 shown. From about 1960 Mullard switched to using the BC prefix for silicon, and AC for germanium, eliminating the confusion of part numbers. in the mid-1960s the first plastic packages were introduced. In 1964 the company produced a prototype electronic desktop calculator as a technology demonstrator for its transistors and cold cathode indicator tubes.

==Space science and astronomy==
In 1957 Philips-Mullard helped to set up the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) at the University of Cambridge. In 1966 the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) was opened near Dorking, Surrey as part of University College London. The Royal Society Mullard Award for &quot;those who have an outstanding academic record in any area of natural science, engineering or technology and to individuals or teams whose work has the potential to make a contribution to national prosperity&quot;, previously for young researchers but with no restrictions on career stage, has been awarded annually from 1967.

==Mullard brand name==
Philips continued to use the brand name &quot;Mullard&quot; in the UK until 1988. Mullard Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey then became Philips Research Laboratories. As of 2007, the Mullard brand was used by Sovtek for valves sold as ECC83, EL34 (European type numbers used by Mullard and many others), etc.

==Z Electric Lamp Company==
The Z Electric Lamp Co. continued business into the 1970s operating from premises in Thornton Heath, southern Greater London, manufacturing lamps of specialised design. However, it closed due to the recession in the mid-1970s.

==50th Anniversary in 1970==
To mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the company, Mullard management decided to have a rose named after the company. Mullard&#x27;s quest was simple, they wanted a world-beater, nothing less, so they contacted the renowned grower Sam McGredy IV in Northern Ireland. The naming fee of £10,000/$24,000 was a lot of money in 1970 and established a record fee for a new rose: Mullard Jubilee &quot;Electron&quot;. To mark the occasion every employee received a &quot;Mullard Jubilee&quot; rose bush.
