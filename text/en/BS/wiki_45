<text>Various ancient Greek calendars began in most states of ancient Greece between autumn and winter except for the Attic calendar, which began in summer.

The Greeks, as early as the time of Homer, appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month &quot;Embolimos&quot; or day is then mentioned, with twelve months of 354 days. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. Each of the city-states in ancient Greece had their own calendar that was based on the cycle of the moon, but also the various religious festivals that occurred throughout the year.

The Greeks considered each day of the month to be attributed to a different entity, such as the seventh day of each month being dedicated to Apollo. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc. Another way that scholars kept time was referred to as the Olympiad. This meant that the Olympic Games had just occurred and according to the four-year span, the games would not be held for another three years. Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of Delphi, because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar.

It was not until the second century BCE that the ancient Greek calendars adopted a numerical system for naming months. It is theorized that this was more for uniformity across the regions than to secularize the calendar. The newly numerical calendars were also created in regions federated from the leagues of Phokis, Ozolian Locris, and Akhaia.

Below are fifteen regions of the ancient Greek world and the corresponding information of the yearly calendar.

==Calendars by region==

In the following tables the month names used in each Greek-speaking city are laid out with Athenian Greek letters (not necessarily how they were spelled in the city they were used in) transliterated into English letters, and with a leading ordinal number column. The ordinal column is mostly for reference, and should not be read too literally: Different cities started their calendar year at different points in the solar year, and the month-numbers do not (necessarily) reflect the start date, which for some cities is not known. Not all of the calendars are equally well-known, and confidence and uncertainties are discussed under individual headings, below. Calendars changed from time-to-time and from city-state to city-state on an irregular basis, sometimes for intercalation.

===Aetolian===
The months of the Aetolian calendar have been presented by Daux (1932) based on arguments by Nititsky (1901) based on synchronisms in manumission documents found at Delphi (dated to the 2nd century BCE). The intercalary month was &quot;Dios&quot;, attested as &quot;Dios embolimos&quot; in SEG SVI 344, equivalent to Delphian &quot;Poitropoios ho deuteros&quot;. The month &quot;Boukatios&quot; corresponds to Delphian &quot;Daidaphorios&quot;, while Delphian &quot;Boukatios&quot; is Aetolian &quot;Panamos&quot;. There has been no argument to dispute the order of months, so the months found by scholars are agreed upon to be the most likely for the time. Unfortunately, there is no convenient table that describes the synchronisms, as one inscription is given for all the months. The only month to have a singular document describing it is the eleventh month, in comparison to the other numerous documents for the rest of the calendar. The Aetolian calendar was used across the League, and additionally, one could find the Aetolian calendar in use across western central Greece until the league dissolved circa the second century BCE.
===Argolian===
===Attic===
The Attic calendar, otherwise known as the Athenian calendar, is one of the best known regions today. There are numerous articles that can detail what the months are named and how the calendar came to be attested. The Attic calendar consisted of twelve months and twenty-nine to thirty days, much like the calendar now. Occasionally, the Attic calendar would be thirteen months and have an intercalary year to keep the festivals aligned with the differing seasons. Additionally, the Attic calendar created extra days to have the festivals align with the lunar cycle.

====Festival calendar====
With the festival version of the calendar, the months were named after the chief of the festival that corresponded to the lunar cycle. The years were also named after the Archon who had served that year (i.e. Eponymos Archon).

Months that had thirty days in them were referred to as Full months while months with twenty-nine days were referred to as Hollow months. This was due to the lunar cycle, and that two lunar cycles was approximately 59.06 days to them. There is additional evidence to suggest that the Attic months can be aligned with the months we have now for comparison. Such is as follows:

====Civil calendar====
Along with the festival calendar, the Athenian calendar had a civil calendar that coexisted and was based upon the prytanies (periods when each of the tribes served on the council). These months were thirty-six or thirty-seven days long and divided into a group of six pytranies and a group of four. This then created a ten month calendar that could be used to refer to time as well as the twelve month calendar.

The main reason this calendar existed was to keep track of the financial transactions within the Assembly. Each month last between thirty-five and thirty-eight days that made up the additional months in the festival calendar and ran from midsummer to midsummer. However, due to the number of tribes changing constantly, this calendar changed with them. Hence the separation between the festivals and a financial calendar. Many accounts of the financial calendar comes from various writings and inscriptions from the reigns of Archons. All evidence of the calendars supports the theory that the Athenians never aligned their calendars or devised a system to draw links between certain days. Scholars assume that people referred to the calendars separately for different occasions with different people.

===Boeotian ===
The history on the Boeotian calendar is very limited as not many detailed records were kept. All months were named, numbered, and adjusted according to the seasons to fit the lunar year. A calendar was used as a reference in archaic times that bore resemblance to better known Greek city-states and their calendar systems. Any early evidence of the Boeotian calendar comes from Hesiod and is debated for interpretation. Hesiod&#x27;s recollection of the months includes only one ( – Lēnaiōn) and this does not appear on any of the other calendars associated with Boeotia. This gap in information suggests to scholars a change in the organizing of months between the archaic and classic times in Boeotia. As most other regions in Greece, Boeotia divided their calendar months into thirds, but had differing ways to count the days. One system represented the days by ordinal numbers, another used common Greek terms to divide the months in half, and the third system indicated a division of the month into decads. With such a diversity in how the months themselves were categorized, it is hard for historians to give a definitive answer on the calendar.

===Corinthian===
The month names of one Corinthian calendar that belongs to the larger family of the Doric calendars, is an Epirotic calendar are inscribed in order on the dial of the Antikythera mechanism.

===Cretan===
===Delphic===
===Elian===
Information about the Elian calendar is scarce and very desolate. Most of the information found depends upon a scholar by the name of Pindar, and while he names some months and the organization of the calendar, much is still unknown. Pindar&#x27;s work is left to interpretation, and as such, causes dispute among scholars to which version is correct. The one conclusion that is well known depends upon the Elian calendar beginning at the time of the winter solstice. However, this is still contested as to why the calendar would have a relationship with the seasons, when it may not have revolved around them in the past. As most other calendars agree, there is much evidence to suggest that the Olympic Games were hosted in the summertime, which would be reasonable to suggest this as the beginning of the year. This is the case with Athens and many regions would model their calendar after it. It would be reasonable to conclude that Elis would follow this example also, which refutes the idea of beginning at the winter solstice.
===Epidaurian===
The Epidaurian calendar was from the Epidauros region in ancient Greece and most extensively declared to be the formal calendar in circa fourth century BCE. Construction of the calendar was put into effect by a German born mathematician named Abraham Fraenkel, and appears to be the most widely accepted version of the order.
===Laconian===
Laconian calendar has several months that are presumed to follow the Spartan calendar, and even include a few of the same months (Ἑκατομβεύς, Κάρνειος, Ἡράσιος). As so many months are attested to be Spartan or belong to the surrounding Spartan areas, it is presumed that Sparta and Laconia could have shared a calendar. There is very little epigraphical data for the names of days in the Laconian calendar. The calendar has a few numerals associated with the days, but there is no way to specifically determine terminology for any of the days.
===Locris===
Locris itself appears to be divided into Eastern Locris and Ozolian Locris. Eastern Locris has almost no remains for its calendars, but still enough to show that two neighboring towns would have different calendars, as far back as the first century BCE. Three months in the Eastern Locris calendar have comparable months with Skarpheia and two months have comparable months with Thronion. Neither Skarpheia nor Thronion can shed light on the order of the months though. Additionally, only one date is confirmed and it corresponds to the month found in the Thronion calendar. This date is known as .

==== Skarpheia months ====
* Aphámius – 
* Ermáuios – 
* Phúllikhos – 

==== Thronion months ====
* Itṓuios – 
* Hippeíos – 

The Ozolian Locris calendar came into being after Locris broke free of Aetolia&#x27;s reign after the dissolvement of the Aetolian League. This is when an affirmed calendar has been located, reaching back as for as the second century BCE. All of the months found in the Ozolian Locris calendar have been attested except for the second, ninth, and eleventh month. In particular, the Ozolian Locris calendar aligns with the Delphian calendar to show that the first month corresponds to Boukatios at Delphi, and the rest follow sequentially. However, most of the information known about Locrian months comes from Delphi, and very little is indigenous to Locris.

As for days, only the first twenty days are confirmed in the calendar. Earlier translations lean toward the dialect with alpha, while later ones use the koine form with eta. It is not until before the first century of the Christian era that numerical names begin.

==== Ozolian Locris ordinal months ====
The month names used in Locris, in Ozolia, are simple ordinal numbers.
===Macedonian===

===Rhodian===
Evidence for the Rhodian calendar is plentiful and comes from a multitude of inscriptions. All of the months in the year are presented and attested for, as well the count of days. However, while the names are known, the order and organization of the months is not a definitive answer. For the amount of resources found on the actual calendar, very few ancient sources mention the calendar in their writings. With the plethora of information accessible, the Rhodian calendar is one studied almost extensively as the Athenian calendar.
: ‡   &quot;Pánamos Embólimos&quot; was technically the 13th month added to the year to re‑align the lunar months with the seasonal year, but it was placed between the usual 6th and 7th months, as a second, or doubled &quot;Pánamos&quot;, rather than at the end of the year.

===Sicilian===
===Thessalian===
The Thessalian calendar was quite similar to the calendars of Pelasgiotis and Hestiaiotis. In Thessaly, the months were divided into semesters known as πρώτη and δζυτέρα έξάμηνος. The order of the months was pieced together from different sequences in ancient inscriptions. Although Thessaly had different months than those of surrounding areas such as Perrhaebian and Magnesia, the methodology of counting days within the months were similar. In Magnesia, however, the months were named after gods, such as in other Greek regions. Three decades were used and a decade plus a number suggests that in the last decade, the Thessalian region counted backward. The Thessalian calendar was standardized only in the Roman era. Previously, all &quot;poleis&quot; had their own calendars based on their respective festivals.

==Transliteration key==

Greek consonants are transliterated as usual for English: = &quot;th&quot;; = &quot;ks&quot; or &quot;x&quot;; = &quot;ph&quot;; = &quot;ch&quot;; = &quot;ps&quot;.

Transliterations are letter-by-letter and do not attempt to reduce Greek spelling conventions to phonetically equivalent English. For example
* Greek &quot;mp&quot; was a spelling convention for the sound of English &quot;b&quot;, and is left as &quot;mp&quot;. 
* Greek &quot;b&quot; is left as &quot;b&quot;, rather than replacing it with its phonetic English &quot;v&quot;.
* Greek is always rendered as &quot;ph&quot;, rather than its (usual) English equivalent &quot;f&quot;, since it was pronounced as &quot;p&quot;+&quot;h&quot; as &quot;ph&quot; in English &quot;tap-head&quot;, in the accent of Athens.
And so on.

Actual pronunciation varied by city and era. Vowels are rendered as 

with all Greek accents carried over as-is onto the Latin letter, with one exception: For typesetting reasons, in this article accented Latin letter &quot;õ&quot; always represents heavily accented Greek omega, never an accented omicron (because of widespread incomplete implementation of Unicode combining accents).

The propriety of Byzantine tonal diacritic marks is contentious. The simple marks rendered as an acute accent (e.g. Greek &quot;&quot; → English &quot;ú&quot;) can be pronounced the same as ordinary dictionary-emphasis used for English words. Other diacritic marks similarly, although they bring up issues for subtle differences. For tonal Greek, which fell out of use early, perhaps before the creation of many of these calendars, all bets are off.

&quot;C&quot; and &quot;K&quot; are equivalent, except for &quot;ch&quot; chi (). Latin letter &quot;C&quot; is now used only for Latin words borrowed from Greek. but &quot;K&quot; is preferred for rendering Greek with English letters. E.g. Latin &quot;cynici&quot; for Greek , English transliteration &quot;kunikoí&quot;, English translation &quot;cynics&quot;. As available typesetting has changed, transliteration conventions have changed, and many old texts use forms that are now obsolete. The only sure thing is to carefully examine the Greek text, and treating all accents placed on ancient text with suspicion.

Latin letter &quot;y&quot; was formerly used (in Latin) for transliterating Greek upsilon, &quot;, upper case &quot;. Although derived from upsilon, in English, &quot;y&quot; has been adapted to replace old English letters, and none of its several present uses are equivalent to ancient and classical era upsilon. Ambiguous English &quot;y&quot; is now deprecated when using accented English letters to represent Greek, and only retained for borrowed Greek words now established in English, and their Latin cognates.

<text>The 251 Club of Vermont, established in 1954, is an organization of Vermont enthusiasts whose objective is to visit the 251 towns and cities in Vermont. In 2022, Essex Junction became a city and now there are 252 cities and towns in Vermont. The club is retaining its name.

==History==

The idea of establishing a club to encourage visiting all of Vermont’s 251 towns and cities was first suggested by Dr. Arthur Wallace Peach in &quot;At the Sign of the Quill&quot; the column he wrote for &quot;Vermont Life&quot; Magazine. Dr. Peach proposed an informal group that became known as the 251 Club in response to countless readers asking “How can I come to know the real Vermont?”

In the Summer 1954 issue, he invited &quot;the native-born and those born elsewhere but with Vermont in them... to discover the secret and lovely places that main roads do not reveal.&quot; &quot;One real way to know Vermont is to visit every town in the state,&quot; wrote Peach as he challenged the state’s citizens and seasonal visitors to join his newly established 251 Club of Vermont. A new batch of Vermont maps had to be printed to meet the growing demand and letters from prospective club members rolled in.

In 2021, the village of Essex Junction voted to become a city, breaking from the town of Essex, bringing the total count of towns and cities in Vermont to 252 on July 1, 2022. The club, during a meeting in November, 2021, voted to keep their original name of &quot;251 Club of Vermont&quot;.

==Current Club Status==

Club members are encouraged to travel at their own pace, by car, on foot or any method of their choosing.

There are no membership requirements and just a small fee for joining. There are no rules. There are no records to keep although many members document their travels with photographs, journals, or blogs. The club offers a &quot;Vermont Travel Journal&quot; as part of its merchandise line for those interested in creating a keepsake of their experiences.

Three times a year, members receive the club newsletter &quot;The Wayfarer&quot; and are also invited to attend the annual luncheon meeting typically held to coincide with Vermont’s Fall foliage season in late September or early October.

Members also receive a profile page on the club web site where they can track their progress and access member resources such as information and archival material.

<doc id="546254" wikidata="Q6623516" url="?curid=546254" title="List of horse accidents">
<text>This is a list of people who had severe injuries or died from accidents related to horses. Some of the listed accidents had important political and historical consequences, which are given when relevant.

==Celebrities==
*Holbrook Blinn (1872–1928), Broadway stage star and silent screen actor, died from injuries in an accident on the grounds of his estate.
*Cole Porter (1891–1964) American composer and songwriter. In a 1937 riding accident his legs were crushed leaving him in chronic pain, largely crippled. (According to a biography by William McBrien and oral history by Brendan Gill.) His right leg was amputated in 1958 as a result of the injury.
*Shyam Chadha (1920–1951), a celebrated Indian actor from Hindi and Punjabi films, died from injuries suffered after falling off a horse.
*Maureen Connolly (1934–1969), tennis star, career ended in 1954 by injuries suffered in a collision between her horse and a truck.
*Malcolm Baldrige Jr. (1922–1987), American politician and United States Secretary of Commerce from 1981 until his death in 1987, from internal injuries sustained in a rodeo accident, when the horse he was riding fell on him during a calf-roping competition. 
*Roy Kinnear (1934–1988), British character actor, bled to death due to a broken pelvis sustained in a fall from a horse.
*Christopher Reeve (1952–2004), actor, paralyzed on May 27, 1995 from the neck down following a fall from his horse while riding cross-country in a 3-day event.
*Kazu Makino (b. 1969), a rock singer, suffered an accident falling from a horse in 2002; the horse trampled her jaw and crushed her facial bones, which required massive reconstructive surgery.

==Historical figures==
* According to this legend, romanticized by Alexander Pushkin in his celebrated ballad &quot;The Song of the Wise Oleg&quot;, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg of Novgorod (?–912) would take death from his stallion. Proud of his own foretelling abilities, he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse&#x27;s skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.
* King Afonso I of Portugal (1109–1185), was severely injured in a fall from a horse in 1167 during a battle; he was captured and as ransom, Portugal had to surrender to Castile all conquests made in Galicia in the previous years; they were never recovered.
* Afonso, Prince of Portugal (1475–1491), died during a riding accident near the Tagus River.
* King Alexander III of Scotland (d. 1286), when he and his horse went off the road in the dark, and fell over a cliff; the long term outcome was increased English influence and the First Scottish War of Independence and the immediate result was a regency because heirs were underage or unborn.

<text>The Great Gospel of John (in the original German published as Das große Evangelium Johannis or &quot;Großes Evangelium Johannes&quot;) is a neo-revelationist text by Jakob Lorber, extending to about 5,500 pages in print, published in ten volumes. It is the major work of Lorber&#x27;s &quot;New Revelation&quot; based on interior locution. It was written in Austria, in the town Graz, from August 1851 until July 1864.

Leopold Engel in 1891 wrote an addendum in an &quot;11th volume&quot;, purportedly also based on interior locution. Supporters of the authenticity of Lorber&#x27;s revelation are divided as to the authenticity of Engel&#x27;s.

The &quot;Great Gospel&quot; is a detailed first-person narrative of Jesus&#x27; last three years of ministry on Earth. It is a day by day account of his miracles, healings, and conversations. It is built on the same structure of the original Gospel of John. Love and works of love are emphasised.

Whereas some of the chapters in the biblical book of John are not covered at all, other sections are added and in much detail. Pharisees are for example revealed to be extremely dangerous, continually plotting against Jesus even though he often forgave them; at one point, a Pharisaical plot to steal from the Romans is revealed, and at their trial Jesus, whose reputation for keen wisdom is known to the Romans by this time, is consulted. The Roman centurion is willing to execute the Pharisees because of their attempt to bribe him, yet Jesus says to let them go, after dividing their plunder: one third to Rome, one-third to the centurion&#x27;s local needs, and one-third to the poor people of the nearby communities, some of whose children had been kidnapped by the Pharisees, to be sold as slaves. 

== Theology and Religious practice ==

=== Concept of God ===
Lorber does not reveal Jesus as one of three &quot;separate&quot; divine persons in a holy Trinity according to teachings of the main Christian churches. Like man, who has been created totally in God&#x27;s image, God consists of three different persons - body, soul and spirit - each with his own individual activity, but nevertheless man is only &quot;one&quot; human being. Likewise Jesus is the only &quot;one&quot; divine being existing in himself eternally out of a well distinguishable trinity. The Father, Jesus as son and the Holy spirit are distinguishable one and the same from eternity. The father in Jesus is everlasting love. Jesus as the son is light and wisdom, the word of God, which emanates from the fire of everlasting love. The Holy Spirit in God is the will of God, the great pronounced word &#x27;It shall be!&#x27; This all is in Jesus: the love, the wisdom and the power. Only one God exists, and this is Jesus, who only took a body on earth, to reveal himself better to the people of the earth.

=== Relationship to God ===
In chapter 59 of the first book of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, it is described how Jesus corrects a God-fearing man, by telling him it is not right for him to have fear of God as what God wants is love. In future he should love God more than fear Him. In chapter 58 of the second book of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot; verse 3, the angel explains that one should speak to God as if He was one&#x27;s equal. The highest spiritual perfection in this world, or in the afterlife, is to become boundlessly free, a perfect person, a child of God, one with God and doing what God is doing. The children of God must be perfect, just as God as their true Father Himself is perfect. This is achieved by loving God above all else, and the neighbor as oneself with all patience and with all strength, either in this world or at least in the other world.

=== Salvation ===
In chapter 10:17 of the first book of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, Lorber explains the gospel of salvation as three steps.
Firstly a person needs to master his flesh. Secondly he needs to purify his soul through works of love. Thirdly a person&#x27;s spirit needs to be awakened from the grave of judgement. These three steps are described as the process of rebirth. In chapter 18:8 the Lord is described to explain to Nicodemus that to be born of water means to be born of humility, and only then by the Spirit of Truth, which is described to be impossible to be received by an impure spirit. This is how entry to the kingdom of God is described to be made possible.

In chapter 62 of the first book of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, the mission of Jesus on Earth is described as to invite those from darkness to the Kingdom of love (via his message of love). 
Verse 9 describes that up to date, not one soul could, when she left her body, loose herself from the earth and that countless suffer in the night of the earth. It is described that when Jesus ascends to heaven he will open the heavens and in exactly the same way every person will enter eternal life. 
It is described that this is the task of universal reconciliation which the Messiah has to accomplish and absolutely nothing else. Jesus came to Earth, according to Lorber&#x27;s writings, to bring people to the right path, through friendly and loving teaching. (&quot;Great gospel of John V11 188:11)
The &#x27;Great Gospel&#x27; does not place emphasis on the crucifixion of Christ, nor on the blood of Jesus for the atonement of sin, but emphasises the teaching of love and its adherence by followers as means to salvation.

=== Cult and laws ===
In chapter 23:6 of the first book of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, it is explained that only one thing is necessary, and that is to adhere to the teaching of Jesus. Baptism is described as a type of washing, that has some benefits and it is described that after Jesus&#x27;s teaching many went to be baptised by John.

In chapter 26 of the second book of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, it is elaborated how the law of Moses is to be kept. There is no differentiation made in Lorber&#x27;s writings between an Old Covenant and a New Covenant.

In the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, book three chapter 215 verse 2, it is explained how sex should never be engaged in for the pleasant feelings associated with it, but always only to produce an offspring.

In chapter 242 of the first book (verse 10 and 13) of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, it is preached that certain food should be avoided for health reasons. Such foods includes unripe fruits, potatoes and coffee. But then what one eats or drinks for the necessary strengthening of the body, will not make him either blessed nor unblessed.

==Editions==
The &quot;Evangelium Johannis&quot; was published posthumously from 1871 to 1876 in 7 volumes by Johannes Busch, a publisher from Dresden (Germany). Later it was numbered and published in ten volumes and divided into chapters by C. F. Landbeck, &quot;Neu-theosophischer Verlag&quot; and &quot;Neu-Salems-Verlag&quot;. Currently it is published by the &quot;Lorber-Verlag&quot;, a dedicated publisher based in Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany. Engel&#x27;s addendum was published by C. F. Landbeck and &quot;Lorber Verlag&quot; as volume 11. The 1st edition dates to 1871; the 8th edition to 1996.

An abbreviated English translation in six volumes has appeared with &quot;Merkur Publishing&quot;.

Since 2011 a full translation (10 volumes) of the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, called &quot;John the Great Gospel&quot;, is available from CreateSpace, Amazon.com.

==Reception==

E. F. Schumacher wrote about the ten big books of the Great Gospel: &quot;(They) contain many strange things which are unacceptable to the modern mentality, but at the same time such a plethora of high wisdom and insight that it would be difficult to find anything more impressive in the whole of world literature.&quot;

Karlheinz Stockhausen set portions of Volume 3 to music in &quot;Sirius&quot;.

<text>Antonio Tejero Molina (born 30 April 1932) is a Spanish former lieutenant colonel of the Guardia Civil, and the most prominent figure in the failed coup d&#x27;état against the newly democratic Spanish government on 23 February 1981.

==Career==
Tejero entered the Guardia Civil in 1950 with the rank of lieutenant and was assigned to a post in Catalonia. In 1958, he was promoted to captain and posted successively to Galicia, Vélez-Málaga and the Canary Islands. In 1963, he was promoted to major, and served in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Badajoz. In 1974, he became a lieutenant colonel, serving as the leader of the &quot;Comandancia&quot; in the Basque province of Guipúzcoa, but had to ask to be transferred to another region when his public declarations against the Basque flag, the Ikurriña, became known. For his accomplishments in the Basque Country, and in combating ETA, he was named Chief of the Planning Staff of the Civil Guard in Madrid. But during his career, he had also begun to accumulate a record of dissent. ETA militants would rig bombs to Ikurriñas; when police officers tried to remove the flag, the bombs exploded, killing several Guardia Civil officers. When the Ikurriña was &#x27;legalized&#x27;, Tejero sent a telegram to Madrid, asking if he should pay honors to the Ikurriña. In Malaga, he ordered or took a major part in a military deployment around the town during the seizure of a flag.

In 1978, Tejero, along with Police Captain and an Army General Staff colonel, whose name was never made public, attempted a coup, known as Operation Galaxia. Tejero was sentenced to a short prison term for mutiny after the collapse of the attempted coup. He was in prison for seven months and seven days.

==Attempted 1981 coup==
On 23 February 1981, Tejero entered the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Spanish Parliament, with 150 Guardia Civil members and soldiers and held the congress members hostage for some 22 hours. Around midnight, when it became clear that no further army units had joined the putsch, King Juan Carlos I gave a nationally televised address denouncing the coup and urging the preservation of law and continuance of the democratically elected government. The following day, coup leaders surrendered and were brutally beaten and arrested by the police.

==Life after jail sentence==
Held in jail after the coup attempt, Tejero founded the Spanish Solidarity party to run in the 1982 general election and obtain parliamentary immunity. With a nationwide total of votes (0.14% of votes cast), the party failed to obtain parliamentary representation. Tejero was the last of the coup participants to be released from jail on 3 December 1996, having then served 15 years in the Alcalá de Henares military prison. He lived in Torre del Mar in the Province of Málaga. In 2006, he wrote to the newspaper &quot;Melilla Hoy&quot;, calling for a referendum on Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) proposals granting a new measure of autonomy to Catalonia. Following the death of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 2006, Tejero attended a Pinochet homage in Madrid. In 2009, Tejero&#x27;s son, Ramón Tejero Díez, wrote to the conservative newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; describing his father as a sincere religious man who was trying to do his best for Spain.

As of 2018, Tejero was residing in Madrid and Torre del Mar, and was working as a painter. On 23 February 2018, he attended the funeral of the 1st Duchess of Franco. On 29 May 2018, a rumour of Tejero&#x27;s death was spread and hailed by Spanish military veterans and supporters, but was quickly refuted by his son.

<doc id="546270" wikidata="Q273039" url="?curid=546270" title="World Youth Day">
<text>World Youth Day (WYD) is an event for the youth organized by the Catholic Church that was initiated by Pope John Paul II in 1985. Its concept has been influenced by the Light-Life Movement that has existed in Poland since the 1960s, where during summer camps Catholic young adults over 13 days of camp celebrated a &quot;day of community&quot;. For the first celebration of WYD in 1986, bishops were invited to schedule an annual youth event to be held every Palm Sunday in their dioceses. Nicknamed &quot;The Catholic Woodstock&quot;, it is celebrated at the diocesan level annually—in most places on Palm Sunday from 1986 to 2020, and from 2021 on Christ the King Sunday—and at the international level every two to three years at different locations. The 1995 World Youth Day closing Mass in the Philippines set a world record for the largest number of people gathered for a single religious event with 5 million attendees. This record was surpassed when 6 million attended a Mass celebrated by Pope Francis—again in the Philippines—20 years later in 2015.

== Traditional process ==
World Youth Day is commonly celebrated in a way similar to many events. The most emphasized and well known traditional theme is the unity and presence of numerous cultures. Flags and other national declarations are displayed among mainly young people to show their attendance at the events and proclaim their own themes of Catholicism. Such is usually done through chants and singing of other national songs involving a Catholic theme.

Over the course of the major events taking place, national objects are traded between pilgrims. Flags, shirts, crosses, and other Catholic icons are carried amongst pilgrims which are later traded as souvenirs to other people from different countries. A unity of acceptance among people is also common, with all cultures coming together to appreciate one another.

Other widely recognized traditions include the Pope&#x27;s public appearance, commencing with his arrival around the city in the &quot;Popemobile&quot; and then with his final Mass held at the event. A festival in Sydney (2008) recorded an estimated distance of a 10-kilometre walk as roads and other public transport systems were closed off.

Pope Benedict XVI criticized the tendency to view WYD as a kind of rock festival; he stressed that the event should not be considered a &quot;variant of modern youth culture&quot; but as the fruition of a &quot;long exterior and interior path&quot;.

== History ==
=== 1987 to 1993 ===
1987 WYD was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 1989 WYD took place in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. 1991 WYD was held in Częstochowa, Poland. 1993 WYD was celebrated in Denver, Colorado, United States.

=== 1995 to 2005 ===

At WYD 1995, 5 million youths gathered at Luneta Park in Manila, Philippines, an event recognized as the largest crowd ever by the Guinness World Records. In an initial comment immediately following the event, Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, stated that over 4 million people had participated.

1997 WYD was held in Paris. 2000 WYD took place in Rome. 2002 WYD was held in Toronto. 2005 WYD was celebrated in Cologne, Germany. Thomas Gabriel composed for the final Mass on 21 August 2005 the &quot;Missa mundi&quot; (Mass of the world), representing five continents in style and instrumentation, in a European &#x27; influenced by the style of Bach, a South American &#x27; with guitars and pan flutes, an Asian &#x27; with sitar, an African &#x27; with drums, and an Australian &quot;&quot; with didgeridoos.

=== 2008 ===
Sydney, Australia, was chosen as the host of the 2008 World Youth Day celebrations. At the time it was announced in 2005, WYD 2008 was commended by the then Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, and the Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell. World Youth Day 2008 was held in Sydney, with the Papal Mass held on the Sunday at Randwick Racecourse.

The week saw pilgrims from all continents participate in the Days in the Diocese program hosted by Catholic dioceses throughout Australia and New Zealand. Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Sydney on 13 July 2008 at Richmond Air Force Base. Cardinal Pell celebrated the Opening Mass at Barangaroo (East Darling Harbour) with other activities including the re-enactment of Christ&#x27;s passion during the Stations of the Cross and the Pope&#x27;s boat cruise through Sydney Harbour. Pilgrims participated in a variety of youth festivities including visits to St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, daily catechesis and Mass led by bishops from around the world, concerts, visits to the tomb of Saint Mary MacKillop, the Vocations Expo at Darling Harbour, reception of the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and praying before the Blessed Sacrament during Adoration. The Mass and concert at Barangaroo saw an estimated crowd of 150,000.

The event attracted 250,000 foreign visiting pilgrims to Sydney, with an estimated 400,000 pilgrims attending Mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI on 20 July.

On 12 June 2008, Xt3.com, a Catholic social online network and news site, was launched as the Official Catholic Social Network of WYD. It was considered to be a direct fruit of WYD08, just as Salt + Light Television was a direct fruit of World Youth Day 2002 in Toronto.
The name was an abbreviation for &quot;Christ in the Third Millennium&quot; and is operated by the Archdiocese of Sydney, with the support of Archbishop Cardinal George Pell. The site was closed in 2019.

In December 2012, the xt3 team produced a &#x27;Gangnam Style&#x27; Advent video.
In May 2007, it was reported that Guy Sebastian&#x27;s song &quot;Receive the Power&quot; had been chosen as official anthem for World Youth Day (WYD08) to be held in Sydney in 2008. The song was co-written by Guy Sebastian and Gary Pinto, with vocals by Paulini.

&quot;Receive the Power&quot; was used extensively throughout the six days of World Youth Day in July 2008 and also in worldwide television coverage.

In November 2008, a 200-page book, &quot;Receive the Power&quot;, was launched to commemorate World Youth Day 2008.

=== 2011 ===

Following the celebration of Holy Mass at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney on 20 July 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced that the next International World Youth Day 2011 would be held in Madrid, Spain. This event was held from 16 to 21 August 2011.

There were nine official patron saints for World Youth Day 2011 in addition to Pope John Paul II: Isidore, John of the Cross, María de la Cabeza, John of Ávila, Teresa of Ávila, Rose of Lima, Ignatius of Loyola, Rafael Arnáiz, and Francis Xavier patron of world missions. During his address to seminarians, Benedict announced that the Spanish mystic and patron of Spanish diocesan clerics St. John of Ávila would become a &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;, a designation granted to only 34 saints throughout the twenty centuries of church history.

An estimated 2,000,000 people attended an all-night vigil to complete the week, more than expected.

=== 2013 ===

Since 2002, World Youth Day has been held every three years. After the 2011 event the next World Youth Day was scheduled a year earlier than usual, in 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in order to avoid any conflict with the 2014 FIFA World Cup being held in 12 host cities throughout Brazil and the 2016 Summer Olympics being held in Rio de Janeiro. More than 3 Million catholic youth had gathered for the event from across the world.

=== 2016 ===

Pope Francis announced at the end of closing Mass for World Youth Day 2013 that Kraków, Poland, would be the venue for World Youth Day 2016. An estimated three million people attended. Young people from many countries took part in the week-long event which began on 25 July 2016, and ended on 31 July 2016 with an open-air mass led by Pope Francis at Campus Misericordiae. The theme for this year&#x27;s World Youth Day was &quot;Blessed Are The Merciful, For They Shall Obtain Mercy&quot;, tying in closely with the Year of Mercy, which was initiated by Pope Francis on 8 December 2015 and concluded 20 November 2016.

=== 2019 ===

At the Concluding Mass for World Youth Day 2016 in Kraków, Pope Francis announced that Panama City would host World Youth Day in 2019. The World Youth Day was held from Tuesday 22 January until Sunday 27 January.

=== 2023 ===

At the concluding mass in Panama City, Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced that the next World Youth Day would be in Lisbon, Portugal. Originally scheduled to be held in August 2022, the Holy See announced on 20 April 2020 that it was postponed to August 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1.5 million pilgrims attended, in particular, the overnight vigil and the concluding mass.

=== 2027 ===

The 2027 World Youth Day will be in Seoul, Korea as announced by Pope Francis during the concluding mass at Parque Tejo in Lisbon.

== Chronology of celebrations ==
Note 02

=== Diocesan ===
== Typical schedule of events ==
=== International level ===
=== Diocesan level ===
At the diocesan level celebrations are decided by a local team usually appointed by the ordinary.

From 1986 to 2020, these celebrations usually occurred during Palm Sunday. They almost always included the Mass of Passion Sunday – when Jesus&#x27; entry to Jerusalem in his final days is commemorated. However, on 22 November 2020, Pope Francis has moved the Diocesan Celebration of World Youth Day from Palm Sunday to the Sunday of the Solemnity of Christ the King starting in 2021. Since then, they almost always includes the Mass of the Solemnity of Christ the King of the Universe - the day of the eschatological importance of Jesus.

Music, prayer, reconciliation opportunities, as well as adoration of the Blessed Sacrament may also be part of the celebrations.

<doc id="546272" wikidata="Q215337" url="?curid=546272" title="1981 Spanish coup attempt">
<text>A coup d&#x27;état was attempted in Spain in February 1981 by elements of the Civil Guard and the Spanish military. The failure of the coup marked the last serious attempt to revert Spain to a Francoist government and served to consolidate Spain&#x27;s democratization process. King Juan Carlos I played a major role in foiling the coup, and the monarchy emerged with renewed legitimacy as a result.

The coup began on 23 February 1981 when Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero, along with 200 armed Civil Guard officers, stormed the Congress of Deputies chamber in Madrid during a vote to swear in Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo as President of the Government. The officers held the parliamentarians and ministers hostage for 18 hours, during which the King denounced the coup in a public television broadcast, calling for rule of law and the democratic government to continue. The royal address fatally undermined the coup, and the hostage-takers surrendered the next morning and all deputies were freed. A simultaneous coup attempt, executed by Captain General Jaime Milans del Bosch in Valencia, also failed. Tejero, Milans del Bosch and a third conspirator, General Alfonso Armada, were sentenced to thirty years in prison. In 1988 the Spanish Supreme Court suggested pardoning Alfonso Armada and Tejero; the government of Felipe González pardoned the former.

==Background==
The coup attempt was linked to the Spanish transition to democracy. Four factors generated tensions that the governing Democratic Center Union (UCD) coalition of conservative parties could not contain:

* almost 20% unemployment, capital flight, and 16% inflation, which were caused by an economic crisis
* difficulty devolving governance to Spanish regions
* increased violence by the Basque terrorist group ETA
* opposition to the fledgling democracy from within the Spanish Armed Forces

The first signs of unease in the army appeared in April 1977. Admiral Pita da Veiga resigned as Navy minister and formed the Superior Council of the Army. This was a result of Pita da Veiga&#x27;s disagreement with the legalisation of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) on 9 April 1977, following the Atocha massacre by neo-fascist terrorists. In November 1978, the Operation Galaxia military putsch was put down. Its leader, Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero, was sentenced to seven months in prison.

While seditious sentiments grew in sectors of the military and extreme right, the government faced a serious crisis at the beginning of the decade, and its position became increasingly untenable in the course of 1980. Key events saw the resignation of the Minister of Culture, Manuel Clavero on 15 January; the restructuring of the government on 3 May; the motion of no confidence against Adolfo Suárez moved by the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) between 28 May and 30 May; the resignation on 22 July of the vice-president, Fernando Abril Martorell, which produced a new reshuffle in September; and the election in October of Miguel Herrero Rodríguez de Miñón, alternative candidate of the official bid for president of the centrist parliamentary group promoted by Suárez.

The growing weakness of Suárez at the heart of his own party led to his televised resignation as prime minister and president of the UCD on 29 January 1981. On 1 February, the &quot;Almendros Collective&quot; published an openly insurgent article in the far-right newspaper &quot;El Alcázar&quot;, which was the mouthpiece of the &quot;Búnker&quot; hardliners, including Carlos Arias Navarro, Luis Carrero Blanco&#x27;s successor as prime minister, and the leader of the francoist party Fuerza Nueva, Blas Piñar. From 2 to 4 February, the King and Queen traveled to Guernica, where the deputies of Basque separatist party Herri Batasuna received them with boos and hisses and various incidents. On 6 February, the chief engineer of the Lemoiz nuclear project, José María Ryan, was found murdered, having been kidnapped a few days earlier. Meanwhile, there was no further news about industrialist Luis Suñer after his abduction.

In this atmosphere of mounting tension, the process of choosing Suárez&#x27;s successor began. Between 6 and 9 February, the 2nd UCD congress in Majorca made it clear that the party was unravelling and Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún was named acting prime minister. On 10 February, Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo was named candidate for prime minister.

==Political flashpoint==
Tensions came to a head on 13 February, when news emerged of the torture and murder in Carabanchel of José Ignacio Arregui, a member of the Basque nationalist movement ETA, who had been held incommunicado for 10 days in the General Security Directorate (&quot;Dirección General de Seguridad)&quot;. A general strike in the Basque region and an acrimonious debate between opposing parliamentary groups in the Congress followed. The government then dismissed various police chiefs, while in the Interior Ministry there were resignations in solidarity with the torturers. &quot;El Alcázar&quot; newspaper judged the government&#x27;s actions a show of weakness that needed to be stopped.

Against this extraordinary backdrop, Calvo Sotelo presented his proposed government on 18 February, but, during congressional voting on the 20th, he failed to obtain the necessary majority approval for confirmation as prime minister, so a new vote was scheduled for the 23rd: the day the conspirators had chosen for their coup attempt. As planned, the coup would require Tejero and General Jaime Milans del Bosch as its principal instigators, with a minor role being played by General Alfonso Armada, a confidant of King Juan Carlos I.

==Coup==

===Assault on the Congress of Deputies===

Several TVE cameramen and technicians filmed almost half an hour of the event, providing the world with an audiovisual record of the attempted coup (which would be broadcast several hours after it ended). Moreover, members of the private radio station SER continued their live broadcast with open microphones from within the Congress of Deputies, which meant that the general public was able to follow along by radio as events unfolded. As such, the date is sometimes remembered as &quot;the Night of Transistor Radios&quot; (&quot;La noche de los transistores&quot;).

At 18:00, the roll-call vote for the swearing in (&quot;investidura&quot;) of Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo as Prime Minister began in the Congress of Deputies. At 18:23, as Socialist-party deputy Manuel Núñez Encabo was standing up to cast his vote, 200 Guardia Civil agents led by Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero and armed with submachine guns, burst into congressional chambers. Tejero immediately took the Speaker&#x27;s platform and shouted &quot;¡Quieto todo el mundo!&quot; (&quot;Nobody move!&quot;), ordering everyone to lie down on the floor.

Most of the deputies dropped to the floor, except for three: acting minister of defence and deputy prime minister, General Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado; acting prime minister, Adolfo Suárez; and Communist Party leader, Santiago Carrillo, who calmly lit a cigarette and remained seated.

As the highest-ranking military official present, Army General (and Deputy Prime Minister) Gutiérrez Mellado refused to comply, confronting Tejero and ordering him to stand down and hand over the weapon. Outgoing Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez made a move to join Gutiérrez Mellado, who briefly scuffled with several civil guards until Tejero fired a shot into the air, which was followed by a sustained burst of submachine-gun fire from the assailants. (The shots wounded some of the visitors in the chamber&#x27;s upper gallery). Undeterred, arms akimbo in defiance, 68-year-old General Gutiérrez Mellado refused to sit down, even after Tejero attempted, unsuccessfully, to wrestle him to the floor. Their face-off ended with Tejero returning to the rostrum and Gutiérrez Mellado returning to his seat.

After several minutes, all the deputies retook their assigned congressional seats. The captain of the Guardia Civil, , strode to the Speaker&#x27;s platform, demanded silence and announced that all those present were to wait for the arrival of &quot;the competent military authority.&quot;

At 19:35, acting prime minister Suárez stood up and asked to speak to the commanders. Shots were fired in response, and a guard flashed a submachine gun towards the deputies&#x27; seats, demanding silence. One of the assailants ordered, &quot;Mr. Suárez, stay in your seat!&quot; Suárez was about to reply when someone else shouted, &quot;siéntate maldita sea&quot; (&quot;Sit down, damn it!&quot;) (Historically, this phrase is attributed to Lieutenant Colonel Tejero, although it was probably Lieutenant Ramos Rueda.) Finally, Tejero grabbed Suárez by the arm and led him forcefully to a room outside the chamber. When Suárez demanded that Tejero explain &quot;this madness&quot;; Tejero&#x27;s only reply was &quot;¡Todo por España!&quot; (&quot;Everything for Spain!&quot;). When Suárez pressed the point, citing his authority as prime minister (&quot;president of the government&quot;), Tejero - using the informal &quot;tú&quot; - replied, &quot;Tú ya no eres presidente de nada!&quot; (&quot;You are no longer the president of anything!&quot;)

Shortly afterward, five of the parliament&#x27;s deputies were separated from the rest: Prime Minister Suárez; the opposition leader, Felipe González, and his deputy, Alfonso Guerra González; Communist Party leader, Santiago Carrillo; and the Defense minister, Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún. The insurgents&#x27; hope, in taking both the executive and legislative authorities prisoner, was to create a power vacuum that would force a new political order.

Almost at the same time, the Captain General of the Third Military Region, Jaime Milans del Bosch, joined the coup with a revolt in Valencia, ordering tanks to be brought out onto the streets and declaring a general state of emergency in an attempt to convince other senior military figures to align with him in supporting the coup. At 21:00 that evening, the Director of National Security, Francisco Laína, published a statement on RTVE announced that, under the instructions of King Juan Carlos I, a provisional government would be formed with the undersecretaries of different ministries in order to ensure State government in alliance with the Assembly of Military Chiefs of Staff (&quot;Junta de Jefes del Estado Mayor&quot;) and led by himself.

The coup was vehemently condemned by member countries of the EEC, especially since Spain was in preliminary negotiations for membership (eventually joining in 1986). Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the UK, called the coup a &quot;terrorist act.&quot; Alexander Haig, US Secretary of State, described the coup as an &quot;internal affair&quot;.

Meanwhile, another insurgent general, Torres Rojas, failed in his attempt to oust General Juste from the Army&#x27;s Armoured Division No. 1 &quot;Brunete&quot;, resulting in Torres Rojas having to abandon his plan to take control of key strategic points in Madrid, including State radio and television headquarters and, therefore, firsthand control of the information as events unfolded.

===Armada&#x27;s soft coup===
Originally, Armada, one of the coup&#x27;s conspirators, had advocated a &quot;milder&quot; course of action, which he then proceeded to implement. As he tried to enter the Palace of Zarzuela, the royal residence, Armada offered the monarch a trade-off: the king would head a new &quot;government of salvation&quot; that would replace the democratically elected one in the hopes of appeasing Tejero and his forces and thereby avoiding a return to the full military dictatorship the conspirators were demanding.

The King, however, refused to receive Armada, who, shortly before midnight, entered the Congress of Deputies alleging that the King had ordered him to assume leadership of the government. As Armada was not the &quot;competent military authority&quot; that Tejero had been waiting for, the latter rejected Armada&#x27;s claims with &quot;My general, I didn&#x27;t assault Congress for this&quot; and, after that, ignored him.

===Military occupation of Valencia===
A simultaneous rebellion in eastern Spain fizzled. Shortly after Tejero took control of the Congress, Jaime Milans del Bosch, Captain General of the III Military Region, executed his part of the coup in Valencia. Deploying 2,000 men and fifty tanks from his Motorized Division as well as troops from the port of Valencia onto the streets and into the city center, they occupied the Town Hall (&quot;Ayuntamiento&quot;) and the Valencian judicial court building (&quot;Las cortes valencianas&quot;). The revolt, known as Operation Turia, was considered key if other military regions were to become involved in the coup. By 19:00, Valencian radio stations began broadcasting the state of emergency declared by Milans del Bosch, who was hoping to convince others to endorse his military action. Well into the night, Valencia was surrounded by armored military trucks and other troop units called in from the Bétera and Paterna army bases. Police snipers took their places on rooftops, military marches were played on loudspeakers and a curfew was imposed on the citizens. An armored convoy was dispatched to the Manises Air Base in order to convince the commander there to support the coup; however, the Colonel of the 11th Wing in charge of the base not only refused to comply, he threatened to deploy two fighter jets armed with air-to-ground missiles (which he claimed to have standing by with their engines running) against the tanks sent by Milans del Bosch, thereby forcing the latter to withdraw. This setback hinted the impending failure of the Madrid coup.

===Juan Carlos&#x27;s repudiation===
Juan Carlos refused to endorse the coup. The king, after protracted discussions with colleagues, was convinced of his military leaders&#x27; loyalty to himself and the Constitution. Two-and-a-half hours after the seizure, Juan Carlos phoned the president of the Government of Catalonia, Jordi Pujol, and assured him that everything was under control. Pujol, just before 22:00 that evening, made a short speech via national broadcasting stations inside and outside of Spain calling for peace. Until 01:00 in the morning (24 February), negotiations took place outside the Congress between the acting government as well as General Armada, who would later be relieved of his duties under suspicion that he had participated in planning the coup.

At 01:14 on 24 February, a speech by Juan Carlos was broadcast on national television, with the king wearing the uniform of the Captain General (&quot;Capitán General de los Ejércitos&quot;), the highest rank in the Spanish Army, to oppose the coup and its instigators, defend the Spanish Constitution, and disavow the authority of Milans del Bosch. In the speech, recorded shortly before at the Palace of Zarzuela, he declared:

From that moment on, the coup was understood to be a failure. Deputy Javier Solana stated that when he saw Tejero reading a special edition of the &quot;El País&quot; newspaper brought in by General Sáenz de Santamaría, which vehemently condemned the hostage situation inside the Congress, he knew that the coup had failed. For his part, Milans del Bosch, alone and thereafter isolated, abandoned his plans at 5:00 that morning and was arrested. Scores of civil guards clad in military fatigues attempted to jump out of the first floor window trying to flee. Others ran out the front door into the arms of officers who had surrounded the building through the night. The deputies were freed that morning after emerging one by one from their all night ordeal shouting &quot;Long Live Freedom&quot;. Tejero resisted until midday on 24 February and was arrested outside the Congress building.

==In popular culture==
The event was made into a motion picture by Warner Bros. entitled &quot;23F&quot; (Spanish nomenclature for 23 February, when the coup took place). &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Jonathan Holland said the period detail of the film was good, but the film followed the officially sanctioned version and failed to scratch beneath the surface of what really happened.

==Legacy==

The most immediate consequence was that, as an institution, the monarchy emerged from the failed coup with overwhelming legitimacy in the eyes of the public and the political class. In the long term, the coup&#x27;s failure could be considered the last serious attempt by adherents to Francoist ideology to establish any long-term authority in the country.

The Supreme Court of Military Justice, known as the Campamento trial (&quot;juicio de Campamento)&quot;, sentenced Miláns del Bosch, Alfonso Armada, and Antonio Tejero Molina to thirty years in prison as the key instigators of the coup d&#x27;état. Eventually, thirty people out of some 300 accused would be convicted for their involvement in the coup.

The extent of any civilian involvement in planning the coup has never been thoroughly investigated. Juan García Carrés, ex-leader of the Sindicato Vertical (the only legal trade union organisation in Francoist Spain), was the only civilian to be convicted.

After the events, the Socialist opposition agreed to a law, the LOAPA, to slow down the establishment of autonomous communities as envisaged in the Constitution, to placate the military.

The bullet holes in the ceiling of the Spanish parliament were retained as a reminder of the coup attempt.

==Alternative theories==
The bloodless yet apparently chaotic unravelling of the coup, the plethora of unanswered questions as to its unfolding, the staunch monarchist allegiance of two main conspirators (Armada and Milans del Bosch), and the King&#x27;s lengthy absence before he finally made a late-night public television address have fueled skepticism and conspiracy theories during the &quot;Campamento&quot; trial and have remained active ever since.

These theories cast doubt on the sincerity of the King&#x27;s defense of democracy and qualify the coup as an example of coercive realpolitik taken to the next level. In essence, this version of events alleges that the coup itself was orchestrated by the Spanish Secret Services in connivance with the King and the Royal House as well as representatives of the major political parties and mainstream media, among others. The plot&#x27;s centerpiece and apparent motivation was the so-called &quot;Operation Armada&quot;, a &quot;soft&quot; coup modeled after Operation De Gaulle and aimed at a national-unity government headed by Armada himself, consisting of an array of ministers from all the main political parties. The first objective was to oust Prime Minister Suárez, who had been criticized relentlessly by the media and the political elite for months and was rumoured to have even lost the King&#x27;s good graces, partly due to Suárez&#x27;s ambitious reformist agenda which had, conceivably, gone off-script. The second objective of the purported &quot;soft&quot; coup was a consequence of the former: to hurry still-toddling Spanish public institutions into fulfilling the convergence criteria the nation was being groomed for, namely NATO and EEC membership and the consolidation of an effectively bipartisan and ideologically moderate parliamentary monarchy. According to the rationale behind the theory, this objective required both purging the armed forces of its most reactionary elements and frightening the common voter into accepting the monarchy and the two-party system as the institutional &quot;default position&quot;.

Yet another and more concrete objective would have been to neutralize an imminent and &quot;hard&quot; coup d&#x27;état planned for later that year, most likely on 2 May. A major clique or sub-group among the instigators of this alleged coup was the so-called &quot;Colonels&#x27; group&quot;, headed by former SECED chief José Ignacio San Martín. Two reasons have been cited why this alleged plot was considered particularly dangerous: San Martín&#x27;s intelligence connections, and the fact that it was colonels and lieutenant colonels, rather than generals, who had direct control over the troops.

According to these theories, Prime Minister Suárez got wind of &quot;Operation Armada&quot; long in advance, hence his sudden resignation in order to avoid it—given that the coup was to occur during the motion of no confidence in his government, scheduled to take place some weeks later. The plan went forward in spite of Suárez&#x27;s resignation, but Tejero&#x27;s failure to understand its ramifications, his guileless belief that he was at the heart of a hardcore coup plot, the media field-day prompted by his violent entrance in congressional chambers (and his crass, uncouth demeanor and language, which was captured by microphones and cameras in the building and later ridiculed by the press), and his refusal to accept the multi-partisan government proposed by Armada, resulted in the simultaneous aborting of the &quot;hard&quot; and the &quot;soft&quot; coup plots by those who had planned them.

Former CESID Special Operations chief José Luis Cortina Prieto, one of the three military officers acquitted during the trial, plays a ubiquitous role in these theories, some of which place him as a major power player within the conspiracy as well as the man responsible for coalescing all the different coup plots into one and later neutralizing them simultaneously. Cortina, who graduated from the Zaragoza Academy in the same cohort as the King, had been appointed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff intelligence services during the Carrero administration and would later assist his brother in creating the &quot;Gabinete de Orientación y Documentación S. A.&quot; () think tank, which would be the germ of the country&#x27;s main conservative party. It has been alleged that during a lunch break in the 23-F trial, and after being subjected to a particularly intense grilling session by the prosecutor, Cortina grabbed a phone and was heard saying: &quot;Como siga este tío así, saco a relucir lo de Carrero&quot; (&quot;If this guy keeps pressing me like this, I&#x27;ll spill the beans about [what happened to] Carrero&quot;). The prosecutor&#x27;s questioning allegedly lost a great deal of intensity when court resumed after the lunch break, and Cortina was finally acquitted.

Arguably up until a broadcast by laSexta, the work by Jesús Palacios and the book &quot;&quot; by Pilar Urbano, these theses have never worked their way into mainstream consciousness, although innuendos and subtle implications were not unusual. Some of these implications may be involuntary. The King&#x27;s authorized biography by José Luis de Vilallonga contains the following interview excerpt:If I were to carry out an operation in the King&#x27;s name but without his consent, my first move would have been to isolate him from the rest of the world and prevent him from communicating with anyone on the outside. Well far from it: That night I could have entered and left my residence at will; and concerning phone lines, I received more calls in a few hours than I had received in a whole month! From my father, who was in Estoril (and was also very surprised to be able to contact me by phone), from my two sisters in Madrid, and from friendly heads of State who encouraged me to resist. Sabino Fernández Campo, chief of the Royal House, expunged this from the Spanish edition.

<text>Shift JIS (also SJIS, MIME name Shift_JIS, known as PCK in Solaris contexts) is a character encoding for the Japanese language, originally developed by the Japanese company ASCII Corporation in conjunction with Microsoft and standardized as JIS X 0208 Appendix 1.

Shift JIS is based on character sets defined within JIS standards (for the single-byte characters) and (for the double-byte characters).

, less than 0.05% of surveyed web pages used Shift JIS (actually decoded as its superset Windows-31J encoding), a decline from 1.3% in July 2014. Shift JIS is the third-most declared character encoding for Japanese websites (though in effect it means its superset Windows-31J is used, so it is third-most popular), declared by 1.0% of sites in the .jp domain, while UTF-8 is used by 99% of Japanese websites.

Shift JIS is also sometimes used in QR codes (they are a Japanese invention also allowing UTF-8, which may though be preferred use).

== Structure ==
Shift JIS is an extension of the single-byte encoding , that uses unassigned code points in to encode the double-byte character set. The lead bytes for the double-byte characters are &quot;shifted&quot; around the 64 halfwidth katakana characters in the single-byte range 0xA1 to 0xDF.

The single-byte characters 0x00 to 0x7F match the ASCII encoding, except for a yen sign (U+00A5) at 0x5C and an overline (U+203E) at 0x7E in place of the ASCII character set&#x27;s backslash and tilde respectively (these deviations from ASCII align with ). The single-byte characters from 0xA1 to 0xDF map to the half-width katakana characters found in .

For double-byte characters, the first byte is always in the range 0x81 to 0x9F or the range 0xE0 to 0xEF (these ranges are unassigned in ). If the first byte is odd, the second byte must be in the range 0x40 to 0x9E (but cannot be 0x7F); if the first byte is even, the second byte must in the range 0x9F to 0xFC.

Shift JIS only guarantees that the first byte of two-byte characters will be high-bit-set (0x80–0xFF); the value of the second byte can be either high or low. The appearance of byte values 0x40–0x7E as second bytes of code words makes reliable Shift JIS detection difficult, because the same codes are used for ASCII characters. Since the same byte value can be either first or second byte, string searches are difficult, since simple searches can match the second byte of a character and the first byte of the next, which is not a valid Shift JIS character. String-searching algorithms must be tailor-made for .

=== Compatibility ===
Shift JIS is fully backwards compatible with the single-byte encoding, meaning that any valid string is also a valid Shift JIS string.

Double-byte characters in need to be transformed in order to be encoded in Shift JIS. For a double-byte JIS X 0208 sequence formula_1, the transformation to the corresponding Shift JIS bytes formula_2 is:

:formula_3
:formula_4

The competing 8-bit format EUC-JP, which does not support single-byte halfwidth katakana, allows for a cleaner and more direct conversion to and from JIS X 0208 code points, as all high-bit-set bytes are parts of a double-byte character and all codes from ASCII range represent single-byte characters.

== Usage ==
HTML written in Shift JIS can still be interpreted to some extent when incorrectly tagged as ASCII, and when the charset tag is in the top of the document itself, since the important start and end of HTML tags and fields (codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6) are encoded as the same bytes as in ASCII, and those bytes do not appear in two-byte sequences.

Shift JIS can be used in string literals in programming languages such as C, but a few things must be taken into consideration. Firstly, that the escape character 0x5C, normally backslash, is the half-width yen sign (¥) in Shift JIS. If the programmer is aware of this, it would be possible to use codice_7 (where ハローワールド is Hello, world and ¥n is an escape sequence), assuming the I/O system supports output. Secondly, the 0x5C byte will cause problems when it appears as second byte of a two-byte character, because it will be interpreted as an escape sequence, which will mess up the interpretation, unless followed by another 0x5C.

== Multiple versions ==

Many different versions of Shift JIS exist. There are two areas for expansion:

Firstly, JIS X 0208 does not fill the whole 94×94 space encoded for it in Shift JIS, therefore there is room for more characters here—these are really extensions to JIS X 0208 rather than to Shift JIS itself.

Secondly, Shift JIS has more encoding space than is needed for and (see § Shift JIS byte map below), and this space can and is used for yet more characters (as either single-byte or double-byte characters).

=== Windows-932 / Windows-31J ===
The most popular extension is Windows code page 932 (a CCSID also used for IBM&#x27;s extension to Shift JIS), which is registered with the IANA as &quot;Windows-31J&quot;, separately from Shift JIS. This was popularized by Microsoft, although Microsoft itself does not recognize the Windows-31J name and instead calls that variation &quot;shift_jis&quot;. IBM&#x27;s code page 943 includes the same double-byte codes as Microsoft&#x27;s code page 932, while IBM&#x27;s code page 932 includes fewer extensions (excluding those which Microsoft incorporates from NEC), and retains the character order from the 1978 edition of JIS X 0208, rather than implementing the character variant swaps from the 1983 standard.

Windows-31J assigns 0x5C to U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS (the backslash), and 0x7E to U+007E TILDE, following US-ASCII. However, most localised fonts on Windows display U+005C as a Yen sign for compatibility. It includes several extensions, namely &quot;NEC special characters (Row 13), NEC selection of IBM extensions (Rows 89 to 92), and IBM extensions (Rows 115 to 119)&quot;, in addition to setting some encoding space aside for end user definition.

Windows codepage 932 is the version used in the W3C/WHATWG encoding standard used by HTML5, which includes the &quot;formerly proprietary extensions from IBM and NEC&quot; from Windows-31J in its table for JIS X 0208, and also treats the label &quot;shift_jis&quot; interchangeably with &quot;windows-31j&quot; with the intent of being &quot;compatible with deployed content&quot;.

=== MacJapanese ===
The version of Shift-JIS originating from the classic Mac OS (known as codice_8, Code page 10001 or MacJapanese) assigned the tilde to 0x7E (following US-ASCII, not which assigns the overline here), but the Yen sign to 0x5C (as in and standard ). It also extended by assigning the backslash to 0x80 (corresponding to 0x5C in US-ASCII), the non-breaking space to 0xA0, the copyright sign to 0xFD, the trademark symbol to 0xFE and the half-width horizontal ellipsis to 0xFF. It also added extended double byte characters; including 53 vertical presentation forms in the range 0xEB41–0xED96, at 84 JIS rows down from their canonical forms, and 260 special characters in the Shift_JIS range 0x8540–0x886D. This variant was introduced in KanjiTalk version 7.

However, certain Mac OS typefaces used other variants. Sai Mincho and Chu Gothic use a &quot;PostScript&quot; variant of MacJapanese, which included additional vertical presentation forms and a different set of extended special characters, based on the NEC special characters, some of which were only available in the printer versions of the fonts. Older versions of Maru Gothic and Hon Mincho from System 7.1 encoded vertical presentation forms at 10 (not 84) JIS rows down from their canonical forms, and did not include the special character extensions, this was subsequently changed. The typical variant used with KanjiTalk version 6 placed the vertical presentation forms 10 rows down, and also used the NEC extension layout for row 13.

=== Shift_JISx0213 and Shift_JIS-2004 === 
The newer JIS X 0213 standard defines an extended variant of Shift_JIS referred to as Shift_JISx0213 (in a previous version of the standard) or Shift_JIS-2004. It is a superset of standard Shift JIS.

In order to represent the allocated rows on both planes of JIS X 0213, Shift_JIS-2004 uses the following method of mapping codepoints.

:formula_5
:formula_6
In the above, formula_2 is a two-byte Shift_JIS-2004 sequence, formula_8 is the number (1 or 2), formula_9 is the number (1-94) and formula_10 is the number (1-94). The &quot;ku&quot; and &quot;ten&quot; numbers are equivalent to formula_11 and formula_12 respectively, where formula_1 is a two-byte JIS sequence referencing a given plane.

The same set of characters can be represented by EUC-JIS-2004, the EUC-JP based counterpart.

Some of the additions collide with popular Shift JIS extensions, including Windows codepage 932 which is used in web standards (see above). For example, compare plane 1 row 89 in (beginning 硃, 硎, 硏...) to row 89 in the JIS X 0208 variant defined in web standards (beginning 纊, 褜, 鍈...). In addition, some of the characters map to Unicode characters beyond the BMP.

=== Other variants ===

The space with lead bytes 0xF5 to 0xF9 (beyond the region used for JIS X 0208) is used by Japanese mobile phone operators for pictographs for use in E-mail. KDDI goes further and defines hundreds more in the space with lead bytes 0xF3 and 0xF4.

Beyond even this, there have been numerous minor variations made on Shift JIS, with individual characters here and there altered. Most of these extensions and variants have no IANA registration, so there is much scope for confusion, if the extensions are used.

A variant is the one that must be used if wanting to encode Shift JIS in source code strings of C and similar programming languages. This variant doubles the byte 0x5C if it appears as second byte of a two-byte character, but not if it appears as a single &quot;¥&quot; (ASCII: &quot;\&quot;) character, because 0x5C is the beginning of an escape sequence. The best way of handling this is a special editor which encodes this way.

<doc id="546311" wikidata="Q1161836" url="?curid=546311" title="The Pointer Sisters">
<text>The Pointer Sisters are an American girl group from Oakland, California, who achieved mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s. They have had a repertoire with many genres, they have sold around 50 million records throughout their career included. The Pointer Sisters have won three Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. The group had 13 US top 20 hits between 1973 and 1987

The group had its origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in 1969 as &quot;Pointers Au Pair&quot;. The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita joined them. Their record deal with Atlantic Records produced several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, recorded their debut album and, with their new label, began seeing more success, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Country Vocal Performance for &quot;Fairytale&quot; (1974). Bonnie left the group in 1977 to commence a solo career with modest success.

After signing with Richard Perry&#x27;s independent label Planet Records, in 1978, the group achieved its greatest commercial success in the 1980s as a trio consisting of June, Ruth, and Anita. They won two more Grammys in 1984 for the top 10 hits &quot;Automatic&quot; and &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot;. The group&#x27;s other U.S. top 10 hits are &quot;Fire&quot; (1979), &quot;He&#x27;s So Shy&quot; (1980), &quot;Slow Hand&quot; (1981), the remixed version of &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot; (1984), and &quot;Neutron Dance&quot; (1985). 

June, the youngest sister, was a drug addict for several years, leaving the group in April 2004 prior to her death from cancer in April 2006, at the age of 52. She was replaced by Ruth&#x27;s daughter Issa Pointer. This trio had a number two hit in Belgium in 2005, covering &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; with Belgian singer Natalia.

Between 2009 and 2015, the group consisted of Anita, Ruth, Issa, and Ruth&#x27;s granddaughter Sadako Pointer. While all four women remained in the group, they most often performed as a trio rotating the lineup as needed. In 2015, Anita was forced to retire due to ill health, leaving Ruth the sole member of the original sibling lineup.

In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked them as the 80th most successful dance artists of all time. In December 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked them as the 93rd most successful Hot 100 Artist of all time and as the 32nd most successful Hot 100 Women Artist of all time.

==History==

===Early days===
As children in West Oakland, the Pointer sisters and brothers were encouraged to listen to and sing gospel music by their parents Reverend Elton and Sarah Pointer, both natives of Arkansas. However, they were told rock and roll and the blues were &quot;the devil&#x27;s music&quot;, and it was only when they were away from their watchful parents that they could sing these styles. They regularly sang at a local Church of God in Christ congregation in West Oakland, but as the sisters grew older their love of other styles of music began to grow.

The sisters were first cousins of NBA basketball player and head coach Paul Silas, and sisters of Aaron Pointer. Aaron was one of very few major league baseball players who became less famous than his own sisters; he later officiated in the National Football League for 17 seasons. The sisters graduated from Oakland Technical High School: Ruth in 1963, Anita in 1965, and Bonnie in 1968. After leaving school, oldest sister Ruth was already married with two children Faun (born 1965) and Malik (born 1966), Anita, the second-oldest sister, also was married with a child Jada. Bonnie, the third oldest sister, and June, the youngest, sought a show business career and they formed a duo, &#x27;Pointers Au Pair&#x27;. Later, Anita quit her job to join the group. They began touring and performing and provided backing vocals for artists such as Grace Slick, Sylvester, Boz Scaggs, Taj Mahal, Elvin Bishop and Betty Davis. 

It was while supporting Bishop at a nightclub appearance in 1971 that the sisters were signed to a recording contract with Atlantic Records. The resulting singles that came from their Atlantic tenure failed to become hits, but the sisters were enjoying their fledgling recording career. One recording has become a Northern Soul classic: &quot;Send Him Back&quot; (Atlantic 45 2893). Concentrated at Wigan Casino around 1973–1974, Northern soul was an underground music scene comprising American 45 rpm records released at the same time as Tamla Motown and imported into the United Kingdom. &quot;Send Him Back&quot; remains a favorite with the worldwide Northern soul audience. Ruth joined the group in December 1972. The quartet signed with Blue Thumb Records and began to record their first album.

In 1976, they were asked to record &quot;Pinball Number Count&quot; for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which was a series of educational cartoons teaching children how to count. It made its debut in 1977 and was a feature on the show for many years. They made their television debut performance at the Troubadour nightclub in Los Angeles on &quot;The Helen Reddy Show&quot;. In 1974, they joined Reddy on the track &quot;Showbiz&quot; which appeared on her &quot;Free and Easy&quot; album.

===Initial success===
The group&#x27;s first album &quot;The Pointer Sisters&quot;, featuring the backing of Bay Area stalwarts the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils, was released in 1973 and received strong reviews, with the group being lauded for their versatility and originality. Its first single &quot;Yes We Can Can&quot; – an Allen Toussaint-penned song, which had been a minor R&amp;B hit for Lee Dorsey in 1970 - afforded the Pointer Sisters the first chart hit reaching No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while both &quot;Yes We Can Can&quot; and the follow-up single: the Willie Dixon cover &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot; were major R&amp;B hits with respective R&amp;B chart peaks of No. 12 and No. 24. 

The Pointer Sisters&#x27; second album, the 1974 release &quot;That&#x27;s a Plenty&quot;, continued in the jazz and be-bop style of its predecessor but provided one exception that caused a great deal of interest: &quot;Fairytale&quot;, written by Anita and Bonnie, was a country song that reached No. 13 on the pop charts, and No. 37 on the country chart. Based on this success, the group was invited to Nashville, Tennessee where they achieved the distinction of becoming the first Black group to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. In 1975, the Pointer Sisters won a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, with Anita and Bonnie also receiving nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Country Song as songwriters of &quot;Fairytale&quot;. The song was also recorded by Elvis Presley.

Subsequent to the live double album &quot;Live at the Opera House&quot;—a recording of April 21, 1974 Pointer Sisters concert at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco—the group&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Steppin&#x27;&quot; was released in 1975. &quot;Steppin&quot;&#x27; produced their Grammy-nominated number one R&amp;B single, &quot;How Long (Betcha&#x27; Got a Chick on the Side)&quot;, which was sampled by female rap icons Salt-N-Pepa a decade later and faithfully covered by Queen Latifah on her 2007 album &quot;Travelin&#x27; Light&quot;. The Pointer Sisters also scored another R&amp;B hit from the album with &quot;Going Down Slowly&quot;, another Allen Toussaint cover, and in 1976 appeared in the classic film &quot;Car Wash&quot; with their song from the movie: &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot;, making the R&amp;B top 20 in early 1977.

The Pointer Sisters were featured on the 1977 album &quot;Saffo Music&quot; by Italian R&amp;B singer Lara Saint Paul and produced by Leon Ware, with bass by Chuck Rainey, guitar by Ray Parker Jr. and mixed by Bill Conti. It was released in Italy under LASAPA records.

November 1977 saw the release of the jazz-funk oriented &quot;Having a Party&quot; which would be the final album release featuring the Pointer Sisters in their original four-woman format. It was only on the title cut that all four members sang; the album&#x27;s other songs featured Anita, Bonnie, and Ruth, but not June, who had taken a break from the group at this time. Recorded in 1976 the album&#x27;s release was so delayed as to cause an eighteen-month gap between &quot;Having a Party&quot; and the precedent Pointer Sisters&#x27; album &quot;Steppin&quot;&#x27;—the compilation album &quot;The Best of the Pointer Sisters&quot; had been issued in July 1976—and without the impetus of a major hit single the &quot;Having a Party&quot; album itself caused scant commercial interest.

===Trio===
By 1977, both June and Bonnie had left the group. June wanted to take a break, and Bonnie left to start a solo career. Bonnie married Motown Records producer Jeffrey Bowen in 1978. She subsequently signed a contract with Motown and this led to a brief, moderately successful, solo career. Her first self-titled album produced the disco song &quot;Heaven Must Have Sent You&quot;. The album was produced by Berry Gordy and husband Jeffrey Bowen. The song became a top 20 pop hit in the US in September 1979.

On January 22, 1978, Ruth gave birth to her second daughter and, now a duo, Ruth and Anita cut back their schedules and concentrated on raising their families. They began talking about the future of the group and what direction it should take. They agreed to dispense with the 1940s nostalgia and go in a contemporary direction. In July of that year, June married William Oliver Whitmore II.

The three sisters then signed a deal with producer Richard Perry&#x27;s Planet Records, which was distributed by Elektra Records. After contributing guest vocals on the group&#x27;s cover of Sly Stone&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Is a Star&quot;, June had returned to the act, making it a trio. With Perry, the trio began working on an album of soft rock, which was released in 1978 with the title &quot;Energy&quot;. The first single, a cover version of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot;, climbed to No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in early 1979, and a third Allen Toussaint cover, &quot;Happiness&quot;, also charted.

In 1979, the trio released an album with a harder-edged rock sound, entitled &quot;Priority&quot;.

===Height of success===
Over the next few years, the Pointer Sisters achieved their greatest commercial success. In 1980, their single &quot;He&#x27;s So Shy&quot;, reached number three on the chart, and the following year &quot;Slow Hand&quot;, off reached number two. The follow-up, &quot;Should I Do It&quot;, featured a 1950s sound and became a major hit, peaking in the top 20 of the US Hot 100. Richard Perry then sold Planet to RCA Records in 1982. The group&#x27;s next album after this merger would be &quot;So Excited!&quot;, which featured the singles &quot;American Music&quot;, a patriotic-themed, modernized take on the girl-group sound, and an early version of &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot;. Both of these singles charted in the US and were also successful in Australia. The group also made an appearance on the sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; in the episode &quot;The Return of the Doo-Wop Girls&quot;.

In 1983, the Pointer Sisters released &quot;Break Out&quot;. With the advent of MTV, videos of the Pointer Sisters&#x27; songs began to be played in heavy rotation. In 1984, they achieved four US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 singles in a row. &quot;Automatic&quot; reached No. 5; &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot; reached No. 3; a remix of &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot; was added to the album almost a year into its shelf life and reached No. 9; and &quot;Neutron Dance&quot;, also featured on the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; soundtrack, reached No. 6.

&quot;I Need You&quot; had been the lead single from the album, and was a significant R&amp;B hit, peaking at No. 13 on the R&amp;B chart and also becoming a moderate Hot 100 hit. The album&#x27;s sixth and final single, &quot;Baby Come and Get It&quot;, became a moderate Hot 100 hit and R&amp;B hit. They received Grammy Awards for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot; and Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices for &quot;Automatic&quot;. This would be the first Pointer Sisters album to feature six singles. The group later performed on the charity hit song &quot;We Are The World&quot; along with other major American recording acts.

In 1984, Ruth became a grandmother for the second time.

These Planet Records singles marked the end of their run of Top 10 hits in the US, although they did score a major hit with their subsequent RCA Records song &quot;Dare Me&quot;, which reached number 11 in 1985. That song would also be the group&#x27;s last Australian top 10 hit. Another single, &quot;Goldmine&quot;, reached number 33 on the US Hot 100 in 1986.

In 1987, the Pointer Sisters starred in an NBC primetime special titled &quot;Up All Night&quot;, which opened with footage of them performing &quot;Jump&quot; at one of their concerts, and which then followed the trio as they socialized and performed around the L.A. night scene. The special, which featured guest appearances by Bruce Willis, the McGuire Sisters, and Whoopi Goldberg, was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. The sisters also were featured in a lavish Diet Coke commercial, which aired during the program, and which presented them singing a soulful jingle about the soda.

The sisters eventually left RCA Records to record for Motown Records and SBK Records, releasing several group albums but these albums did not achieve the level of success of their earlier releases.

===Later years===
Ruth became a grandmother as &quot;Break Out&quot; reached success; Anita became a grandmother in 1990 when her only child Jada gave birth to Roxie. On September 8, 1990, Ruth married a man named Michael Sayles (born 1957). The sisters entertained US troops in the Persian Gulf in 1991 with Bob Hope. By 1991, June had ended her thirteen-year marriage to William Oliver Whitmore II. In August 1993 at age 47 Ruth gave birth to twins Ali and Conor Sayles. 1994 saw the release of the Various Artists album &quot;Rhythm, Country and Blues&quot; which featured duets of country artists with R&amp;B artists. This album contains a duet with the Pointer Sisters and Clint Black together on the classic song &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;. 

Also in 1994, the Pointer Sisters were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and began touring with a production of the Fats Waller-based musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;. In 1995 Pointer Sisters recorded &quot;Feel for the Physical&quot; as a duet with Thomas Anders (of Modern Talking fame) for his album &quot;Souled&quot;. They were also one of the featured acts at the closing ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

In 1995–1996, the Pointer Sisters returned to their original jazzy incarnation touring nationally in &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;. During this tour issues with June came to the fore as she missed many performances. Understudy Wendy Edmead replaced her on these occasions. In 2002, Ruth&#x27;s daughter Issa Pointer began performing with the Pointer Sisters in June&#x27;s stead. On June 9, 2002, June and Bonnie performed as a duo on the bill at the San Jose Gay Pride Celebration the pair having been recruited by a promoter who had failed to recruit the official Pointer Sisters trio for the event.

The June/Bonnie appearance at San Jose Pride was promoted as a &quot;Pointer Sisters&quot; gig, with pictures of June performing with Anita and Ruth utilized in its promotion, causing Anita and Ruth to sue the promoter and other affiliates of the San Jose Pride gig. Neither Bonnie nor June was named in the suit. Bonnie and June performed as a duo at other Gay Pride celebrations and participated in the Get Up &#x27;n&#x27; Dance disco music tour in the summer of 2003, the duo being officially billed as &quot;Bonnie and June Pointer, formerly of the Pointer Sisters&quot;.
In fall 2002, the Pointer Sisters played the Night of the Proms tour in Europe marking the inauguration of Issa Pointer, the daughter of Ruth, as the replacement for June. Ruth would recall: &quot;We sort of pulled a fast one by waiting until the last minute to inform the promoters of [the] roster changebecause we didn&#x27;t want to give them the chance to change their minds.&quot; She also said, &quot;Anita and I had talked for some time about having Issa and [Anita&#x27;s] daughter Jada alternate in the third spot in the lineupIssa was chosen [to go] first because she had experience singing solo at a lot of New England-area functions.&quot; Issa&#x27;s membership in the Pointer Sisters would remain constant until 2009, Jada having been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the autumn of 2002 and dying June 10, 2003.

The Pointer Sisters recorded their first album with Issa rather than June in April 2004 with &quot;The Pointer Sisters - Live in Billings&quot; recorded at the Alberta Bair Theatre in Billings, Montana. The first studio recording by the Pointer Sisters to feature Issa was &quot;Christmas in New York&quot; for YMC Records www.ymcrecords.com recorded in the summer of 2005 for release for the multi-artist seasonal release &quot;Smooth &amp; Soulful Christmas Collection&quot; on YMC Records: &quot;Christmas in New York&quot; afforded the Pointer Sisters their last appearance on a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart to date, the track reaching #21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. Christmas In New York was written by Nathan East and Chris Christian and produced by them.

The group&#x27;s next recording was a remake of the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; recorded with Natalia: this track spent sixteen weeks in the Top 20 of Belgium&#x27;s Flemish chart from October 2005 with a peak of #2. In 2008, Anita and Ruth recorded the last Pointer Sisters album to date &quot;The Pointer Sisters Favorites&quot; consisting of remakes of ten of the group&#x27;s biggest hits: recorded in response to the group&#x27;s failure to receive royalties from the inclusion of any Pointer Sisters&#x27; hits on multi-artist hits compilations, &quot;...Favorites&quot; was sold exclusively at the group&#x27;s live gigs and at the website ThePointerSisters.com, but was added to iTunes in 2013.

In recent years, many Pointer Sisters songs have been covered by contemporary artists, such as &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot; by Girls Aloud, which reached number two at the UK singles chart in 2003, &quot;Dare Me&quot; was turned into the dance smash &quot;Stupidisco&quot; by Belgian DJ Junior Jack, indie band Le Tigre covered in 2004 &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot; on their third album &quot;This Island&quot;, and French DJ Muttonheads sampled &quot;Back in My Arms&quot; on his 2005 club hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Pinball Number Count&quot; was re-edited for Coldcut&#x27;s Ninja Tune label, becoming a surprise dance hit. The same song has also been sampled by Venetian Snares of the Planet Mu record label. Most recently in 2007, Tommy Boy recording artist Ultra Naté has released a dance-pop cover of &quot;Automatic&quot; that reached #1 at the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. The same year, How Long (Betcha&#x27; Got a Chick on the Side) was faithfully covered by Queen Latifah on her 2007 album &quot;Travelin&#x27; Light&quot;.

On June 7, 2006, Anita guest-starred on &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; singing with Olympic gymnast Carly Patterson on &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot;: on the following night&#x27;s results show the duo&#x27;s encore was &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot;.

On August 4, 2009, Ruth, Anita and Bonnie stopped by The Kibitz Room at Canter&#x27;s in Los Angeles and jammed with the band and Ruth&#x27;s son Malik. They sang &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Yes We Can Can&quot;, and &quot;Going Down Slowly&quot;. On November 4, 2009, the Pointer Sisters played &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot; and &quot;Neutron Dance&quot; on CBS morning show &quot;The Early Show&quot; with Ruth&#x27;s granddaughter, Sadako Johnson. Issa is currently pursuing a solo career.

While promoting an October 28, 2010, Detroit gig by the Pointer Sisters –then comprising Anita and Ruth and Sadako Pointer Johnson — Ruth Pointer, asked &quot;Do you [and Anita] plan on recording an album with Sadako?&quot;, replied: &quot;Hmmnot really. We talk about it from time to time, but the business has changed so much. It&#x27;s not like the old days when you just have a record deal and go in the studio and record with a producer and then start promoting.&quot; In the same interview Ruth commented on the Pointer Sisters&#x27; profile having dropped in recent years: &quot;We&#x27;ve performed a lot in Europe and Asia and Australia, and it&#x27;s just that we haven&#x27;t been very visible publicly in the [US]. We still do a lot of corporate parties and private parties because I mean, let&#x27;s face it, those are the people that are in our own age group and know our songs.&quot;

In November 2011, the Pointer Sisters toured Australia and played one gig in New Zealand with a lineup consisting of Ruth, Sadako Johnson and Issa; the last-named was a last-minute and presumably temporary replacement for Anita, who did not feel up to travel due to an unnamed health concern. Ruth, Sadako Johnson and Issa were the personnel for a February 11, 2012 Pointer Sisters concert in Metairie, Louisiana. At the July 6, 2012 Essence Fest show in New Orleans, Anita had rejoined the group, the lineup for that concert being Ruth, Anita and Sadako Johnson.

In an August 2012 interview Ruth stated: &quot;Anita has had some health issues recently so we try to give her a break when she needs it. When that happens we bring my daughter [Issa] in to fill in for her.&quot; At a later Pointer Sisters concert, performing with the Columbus Symphony on June 14, 2013 (and filling in for Chaka Khan with a week&#x27;s notice), the lineup was Anita, Ruth and Issa Pointer.

The Pointer Sisters were scheduled to play six Australian dates in May and June 2016 with the lineup of Ruth, Issa and Sadako Johnson. Media reports indicated that Anita&#x27;s health issues necessitated her retiring from the group. In a February 25, 2016 interview with News.com.au, Ruth said of the Pointer Sisters recent live performance history: &quot;I&#x27;m almost inclined to call [the group&#x27;s live engagements] pop-up engagements, not tours. We don&#x27;t do the tours like we used to do back in the day. We&#x27;ll leave that to the young folks, out on the road in buses for months at a time.We still have a good time, we do a lot of corporate dates, a lot of casinos, special events, fundraisers, that&#x27;s our audience. We&#x27;re so glad [the Pointer Sisters&#x27;s songs are] still relevant and people still want to hear them being sung and we love singing them.&quot;

The Pointer Sisters were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2005.

== Personal lives==

In November 2000, the sisters lost their mother, Sarah.

In 2003, sister Anita lost her only child Jada to cancer. Jada was the subject of the 1973 song &quot;Jada&quot;. 

On April 11, 2006, June, who suffered from drug addiction, died of cancer at the age of 52. According to a family statement, she was surrounded by Ruth and Anita as well as brothers Aaron and Fritz. On May 4, 2006, Bonnie appeared on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; saying the other sisters had not fulfilled June&#x27;s burial wishes, instead having her cremated because it was cheaper. Bonnie also stated the sisters had not let her ride in the family car at the funeral. Anita and Ruth responded that Bonnie had demanded to rejoin the group and was upset that she had been rejected, and that June had left no instructions for her burial. The sisters seemed estranged from Bonnie until she joined Anita on the &quot;Idol Radio Show&quot; in 2007.

Bonnie was arrested for allegedly possessing crack cocaine on November 18, 2011, in South Los Angeles, after the car she was riding in was pulled over for a mechanical malfunction. She filed for divorce from Motown Records producer, Jeffrey Bowen, on July 1, 2014. On June 8, 2020, she died at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 69.

Anita died from cancer on December 31, 2022.

<text>The tradition of humor in Judaism dates back to the compilation of the Torah and the Midrash in the ancient Middle East, but the most famous form of Jewish humor consists of the more recent stream of verbal and frequently anecdotal humor of Ashkenazi Jews which took root in the United States during the last one hundred years, it even took root in secular Jewish culture. In its early form, European Jewish humor was developed in the Jewish community of the Holy Roman Empire, with theological satire becoming a traditional way to clandestinely express opposition to Christianization.

During the nineteenth century, modern Jewish humor emerged among German-speaking Jewish proponents of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; (Jewish Enlightenment), it matured in the shtetls of the Russian Empire, and then, it flourished in twentieth-century America, arriving with the millions of Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe between the 1880s and the early 1920s. Beginning on vaudeville and continuing on radio, stand-up, film, and television, a disproportionately high percentage of American comedians have been Jewish. &quot;Time&quot; estimated in 1978 that 80 percent of professional American comics were Jewish.

Jewish humor is diverse, but most frequently, it consists of wordplay, irony, and satire, and the themes of it are highly anti-authoritarian, mocking religious and secular life alike. Sigmund Freud considered Jewish humor unique in that its humor is primarily derived from mocking the in-group (Jews) rather than the &quot;other&quot;. However, rather than simply being self-deprecating, it also contains an element of self-praise.

==History==
Jewish humor is rooted in several traditions. Jewish humor can be found in one of history&#x27;s earliest recorded documents, the Hebrew Bible, as well as the Talmud. In particular, the intellectual and legal methods of the Talmud, which uses elaborate legal arguments and situations often seen as so absurd as to be humorous, in order to tease out the meaning of religious law.
For example: 
A Sephardic tradition is centered on a Nasreddin-derived folk character who is known as Djoha.

A more recent tradition which originated in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe is an egalitarian tradition in which the powerful were frequently mocked subtly, rather than attacked overtly—as Saul Bellow once put it, &quot;Oppressed people tend to be witty.&quot; Jesters known as badchens used to poke fun at prominent members of the community during weddings, creating a good-natured tradition of humor as a levelling device. Rabbi Moshe Waldoks, a scholar of Jewish humor, argued:

After Jews began to migrate to America in large numbers, they, like other minority groups, found it difficult to gain mainstream acceptance and obtain upward mobility. The development of the entertainment industry, combined with the tradition of Jewish humor, provided a potential route where Jews could succeed. One of the first successful radio &quot;sitcoms&quot;, &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, featured a Jewish family. As radio and television matured, many of its most famous comedians, including Eddie Cantor, Jack Benny, George Burns, Henny Youngman, Milton Berle, Phyllis Diller, Jack Carter, Sid Caesar, Jerry Lewis, and Joan Rivers, were Jewish. The Jewish comedy tradition continues today, with Jewish humor much entwined with mainstream humor, as comedies like &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, and Woody Allen films indicate.

In his essay which is titled &quot;Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious&quot;, Sigmund Freud analyzes the nature of Jewish jokes, among other things.

==Types==
===Religious humor===
Because religion was such an important part of life in Jewish communities, much of the humor which was developed in them is centered on the relationship between Judaism, the individual Jew and the Jewish community as a whole.

The part left out is the fact that it was traditional to go to services, regardless of what one believed, and the rabbi was merely following that tradition. This is like the story of the boy who tells his rabbi he can&#x27;t daven (pray), because he no longer believes in God. The rabbi merely tells him, &quot;Yes God, no God: doesn&#x27;t matter! Three times a day, you DAVEN!&quot;

====Assimilation====
The American Jewish community has been lamenting the rate of assimilation among its children and it has also been lamenting the absence of them as they grow into adulthood.

====Self-deprecating====
Jews often mock their own negative stereotypes.

====Wit====
In the tradition of the legal arguments of the Talmud, one prominent type of Jewish humor involves clever, often legalistic, solutions to Talmudic problems, such as:

====Tales of the Rebbes====
Some jokes make fun of the &quot;Rebbe miracle stories&quot; and involve different Hasidim bragging about their teachers&#x27; miraculous abilities:
Or
===Eastern European Jewish humor===
A number of traditions in Jewish humor date back to stories and anecdotes from the 19th century.

====Chełm====
Jewish folklore makes fun of the Jewish residents of Chełm (Yiddish: כעלעם, Hebrew: חלם; often transcribed as &quot;Helm&quot;) in eastern Poland for their foolishness. These stories often center on the &quot;wise&quot; men and their silly decisions, similarly to the English Wise Men of Gotham or the German Schildbürger. The jokes were almost always about silly solutions to problems. Some of these solutions display &quot;foolish wisdom&quot; (reaching the correct answer by the wrong train of reasoning), while others are simply wrong.

Many of these stories have become well-known thanks to storytellers and writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Nobel Prize-winning Jewish writer in the Yiddish language, who wrote &quot;The Fools of Chełm and Their History&quot; (published in English translation in 1973), and the great Soviet Yiddish poet who wrote stories in verse. The latter achieved great popularity in the Soviet Union in Russian and Ukrainian translations, and were made into several animated films.

Other notable adaptations of folklore Chełm stories into the mainstream culture are the comedy &quot;Chelmer Chachomim&quot; (&quot;The Wise Men of Chelm&quot;) by Aaron Zeitlin, &quot;The Heroes of Chelm&quot; (1942) by Shlomo Simon, published in English translation as &quot;The Wise Men of Helm&quot; (Solomon Simon, 1945) and &quot;More Wise Men of Helm&quot; (Solomon Simon, 1965), and the book &quot;Chelmer Chachomim&quot; by Y. Y. Trunk. The animated short film comedy &quot;Village of Idiots&quot; also recounts Chełm tales.

Allen Mandelbaum&#x27;s &quot;Chelmaxioms : The Maxims, Axioms, Maxioms of Chelm&quot; (David R. Godine, 1978) treats the wise men less as fools than as an &quot;echt Chelm&quot; of true scholars who in their narrow specialized knowledge are nonetheless knowledgeable but lacking sense. 
The poetry of [Chelmaxioms] is supposedly the discovered lost manuscripts of the wise men of Chelm.

Here are a few examples of a Chełm tale:



====Hershele Ostropoler====
Hershele Ostropoler, also known as Hershel of Ostropol, was a legendary prankster who was based on a historic figure. Thought to have come from Ukraine, he lived in the small village of Ostropol, working as &quot;shochet&quot;, a ritual slaughterer. According to legend he lost his job because of his constant joking, which offended the leaders of the village.

In his subsequent wanderings throughout Ukraine, he became a familiar figure at restaurants and inns.

Eventually he settled down at the court of Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh, grandson of the Baal Shem Tov. The rabbi was plagued by frequent depressions, and Hershele served as a sort of court jester, mocking the rabbi and his cronies, to the delight of the common folk.

After his death he was remembered in a series of pamphlets recording his tales and witty remarks.

He was the subject of several epic poems, a novel, a comedy performed in 1930 by the Vilna Troupe, and a U.S. television programme in the 1950s. Two illustrated children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol&quot;, and &quot;Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins&quot;, have been published. Both books were written by Eric Kimmel and illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. In 2002, a play entitled &quot;Hershele the Storyteller&quot; was performed in New York City. He is also the protagonist in a new series of comics for children with the titles The Adventures of Hershele, Hershele Rescues the Captives, Hershele and the Treasure in Yerushalayim, Hershele makes the Grade, and Hershele Discovers America.

===Humor about antisemitism===
Much Jewish humor takes the form of self-deprecating comments on Jewish culture, acting as a shield against antisemitic stereotypes by exploiting them first:

Or, on a similar note:

And another example, a direct slice of &quot;galgenhumor&quot; (gallows humor):

This one combines accusations of the lack of patriotism, and avarice:

===American Jewish humor===
A 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 42 percent of American Jews rated humor as essential to their Jewish identity.

====About religion====
One common strain of Jewish humor examines the role of religion in contemporary life, often gently mocking the religious hypocrite. For example:

Or, on differences between Orthodox, Conservative and Reform movements:

In particular, Reform Jews may be lampooned for their rejection of traditional Jewish beliefs. An example, from one of Woody Allen&#x27;s early stand-up routines:
Jokes have been made about the shifting of gender roles (in the more traditional Orthodox movement, women marry at a young age and have many children, while the more liberal Conservative and Reform movements make gender roles more egalitarian, even ordaining women as Rabbis). The Reconstructionist movement was the first to ordain homosexuals, all of which leads to this joke:

The following joke refers to Jewish congregational rivalry and splitting.
====About Jews====
Jewish humor continues to exploit stereotypes of Jews, both as a sort of &quot;in-joke&quot;, and as a form of self-defence. Jewish mothers, &quot;cheapness&quot;/frugality, &quot;kvetching&quot;, and other stereotyped habits are all common subjects. Frugality has been frequently singled out:
Or,

Or,

Or,

Or,

Or, about traditional roles of men and women in Jewish families:

Or,

Or

Or

Or, on kvetching (complaining),


A version of the following joke is quoted in &quot;Born To Kvetch: Yiddish Language and Culture in All Its Moods&quot;, by Michael Wex:

Wex comments:
 &quot;It contains virtually every important element of the Yiddish-speaking mind-set in easily accessible form: the constant tension between the Jewish and the non-Jewish; the faux naivete that allows the old man to pretend that he isn&#x27;t disturbing anyone; the deflation of the other passenger&#x27;s hopes, the disappointment of all his expectations after he has watered the Jew; and most importantly of all, the underlying assumption, the fundamental idea that kvetching—complaining—is not only a pastime, not only a response to adverse or imperfect circumstance, but a way of life that has nothing to do with the fulfillment or frustration of desire.&quot;

====About Christianity====
Many Jewish jokes involve a rabbi and a Christian clergyman, exploiting different interpretations of a shared environment. Often they start with something like &quot;A rabbi and a priest...&quot; and make fun of either the rabbi&#x27;s interpretation of Christianity or (seeming) differences between Christian and Jewish interpretation of some areas.

===Jewish humor in the Soviet Union===
&quot;See Russian jokes in general, or more specifically Rabinovich jokes, Russian Jewish jokes, Russian political jokes; also History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union.&quot;
Or, in the last years of the Soviet Union:

Or
===Israeli humor===

Israeli humor featured many of the same themes as Jewish humor elsewhere, making fun of the country and its habits, while containing a fair bit of gallows humor as well, as a joke from a 1950 Israeli joke book indicates:

Israelis&#x27; view of themselves:
==Role of Yiddish==

Some Yiddish words may sound comical to an English speaker. Terms like shnook and shmendrik, shlemiel and shlimazel (often considered inherently funny words) were exploited for their humorous sounds, as were &quot;Yinglish&quot; shm-reduplication constructs, such as &quot;fancy-schmancy&quot;. Yiddish constructions—such as ending sentences with questions—became part of the verbal word play of Jewish comedians.

<doc id="546331" wikidata="Q137475" url="?curid=546331" title="Lucky Luke">
<text>Lucky Luke is a Western comic album series created by Belgian cartoonist Morris in 1946. Morris wrote and drew the series single-handedly until 1955, after which he started collaborating with French writer René Goscinny. Their partnership lasted until Goscinny&#x27;s death in 1977. Afterwards, Morris collaborated with several other writers until his own death in 2001. Since Morris&#x27;s death, French artist Achdé has drawn the series, scripted by several successive writers.

The series takes place in the American Old West of the United States. It stars the titular Lucky Luke, a street-smart gunslinger known as the &quot;man who shoots faster than his shadow&quot;, and his intelligent horse Jolly Jumper. Lucky Luke is pitted against various villains, either fictional or inspired by American history or folklore. The most famous of these are the Dalton Brothers, loosely based on the Dalton Gang of the early 1890s and claimed to be their cousins. The stories are filled with humorous elements parodying the Western genre.

&quot;Lucky Luke&quot; is one of the best-known and best-selling comics series in Europe. It has been translated into 30 languages. 82 albums have appeared in the series as of 2022, and 3 special editions/homages, at first published by Dupuis. From 1968 to 1998 they were published by Dargaud and then by Lucky Productions. Since 2000 they have been published by Lucky Comics. Each story was first serialized in a magazine: in &quot;Spirou&quot; from 1946 to 1967, in &quot;Pilote&quot; from 1968 to 1973, in &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; in 1974–75, in the French edition of &quot;Tintin&quot; in 1975–76, and in various other magazines since.

The series has also had adaptations in other media, such as animated films and television series, live-action films, video games, toys, and board games. As of 2022, all 82 books in the series&#x27; regular albums are available in English.

==Publication history==
Simultaneously a tribute to the mythic Old West and an affectionate parody, the comics were created by Belgian artist Morris, who drew &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; from 1946 until his death in 2001. The first &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; adventure, &quot;Arizona 1880&quot;, appeared in the French version of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot; in October 1946. It later appeared in the &quot;Almanach&quot; issue of &quot;Spirou&quot; on 7 December 1946.

After several years of writing the strip himself, Morris began a collaboration with René Goscinny. He was the series writer during what is considered its golden age, starting with the story , published on 25 August 1955 in &quot;Spirou&quot;, until his death in 1977 (with the exception of ). Ending a long run of serial publications in &quot;Spirou&quot;, the series was shifted to Goscinny&#x27;s &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine in 1967 with the story . Later it was taken to Dargaud publisher.

After the death of Goscinny in 1977, several writers succeeded him: including Raymond &quot;Vicq&quot; Antoine, Bob de Groot, Jean Léturgie and Lo Hartog van Banda. At the 1993 Angoulême International Comics Festival, &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; was given an honorary exhibition.
After Morris&#x27; death in 2001, French artist Achdé continued drawing new &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; stories in collaboration with writers Laurent Gerra, Daniel Pennac and Tonino Benacquista. Since 2016, new albums are scripted by writer Jul.

Lucky Luke comics have been translated into: Afrikaans, Arabic, Bengali, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, Vietnamese, Welsh and Bulgarian.

==Stories==
===Overview===
Although always described as a cowboy, Luke generally acts as a righter of wrongs or bodyguard of some sort, where he excels thanks to his on-hand resourcefulness and incredible gun prowess. A recurring task is that of capturing the bumbling but menacing gangsters the Dalton brothers, Joe, William, Jack and Averell. He rides Jolly Jumper, &quot;the smartest horse in the world&quot; and is often accompanied by prison guard dog Rin Tin Can, &quot;the stupidest dog in the universe&quot;, a spoof of Rin Tin Tin.

Luke meets many historical Western figures such as Calamity Jane, Billy the Kid, Judge Roy Bean and Jesse James&#x27;s gang, and takes part in events such as the guarding of Wells Fargo stagecoaches, the Pony Express, the building of the First Transcontinental Telegraph, the Rush into the Unassigned Lands of Oklahoma, the building of the Statue of liberty, and a tour by French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Some of the books feature a one-page article on the background to the events featured. Goscinny once said that he and Morris tried to base the Lucky Luke adventures on real events whenever possible, but that they would not let the facts get in the way of a funny story.

The chronology of the albums is deliberately murky, and in most albums no particular year is given. The villains and incidental characters based on real persons lived over most of the mid-to-late-19th century. For example, in the album &quot;Daily Star&quot;, Lucky Luke meets a young Horace Greeley, prior to his moving to New York in 1831. Judge Roy Bean, who was appointed judge in 1882, appears in another album, and in another album yet, Lucky Luke takes part in the 1892 Coffeyville shootout against the Dalton gang. Lucky Luke himself appears unchanged in all stories.

Except in the first few stories, where he shoots and kills Mad Jim and the old Dalton brothers gang in Coffeyville, Luke is never seen to kill anyone, preferring to disarm people by simply shooting weapons out of their hands.

Phil Defer was killed in the first publication in &quot;Le Moustique&quot;, but in the later album collection, this was changed into a debilitating shoulder wound.

In the final panel of each story, except the earliest, Lucky Luke rides off alone on Jolly Jumper into the sunset, singing (in English) &quot;I&#x27;m a poor lonesome cowboy, and a long way from home...&quot;. Luke first said this line in 1949 and it became a tradition afterwards. The song itself is based on a real life cowboy song, collected by John Lomax in &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot;. 

=== Historical figures who have appeared in &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; ===
===Smoking controversy===

Morris, who had been criticized over Lucky Luke&#x27;s cigarette for a long time, answered his critics: &quot;the cigarette is part of the character&#x27;s profile, just like the pipe of Popeye or Maigret&quot;. It is claimed that Morris was forced to remove the cigarettes Lucky Luke smokes from his strip and Lucky Luke who &quot;used to be a heavy smoker&quot;, had to give up smoking for &quot;commercial reasons&quot;, apparently to &quot;gain access to the American market&quot;.

Morris received an award from the World Health Organization in 1988 for replacing Luke&#x27;s omnipresent cigarette with a wisp of straw in the story &quot;Fingers&quot; (1983).
In the 2007 animated film &quot;Tous à l&#x27;Ouest: Une aventure de Lucky Luke&quot;, Lucky Luke is seen using what appears to be a nicotine patch and mentions that before that he had to &quot;chew on a piece of straw for a while&quot; right after he quit smoking. In the 1994 story &quot;Le Pont sur le Mississippi&quot; (&quot;The Bridge Over the Mississippi&quot;), he is seen rolling a cigarette again, although he claims it was just to hide his boredom. And in &quot;Sarah Bernhardt&quot; (1982), when Bernhardt&#x27;s cook lights a fire to make a cake, despite Luke&#x27;s strict orders not to, Luke is seen rolling a cigarette in an irate mood. He then strikes a match, only for it to be blown out by Jolly Jumper, who reminds him of his own &quot;no fire&quot; orders.

== Spin-off series ==
A spin-off series called &quot;Rantanplan&quot; and starring Luke&#x27;s dimwitted canine sidekick began in 1987. It has been written over the years by several successive teams of writers and artists. The character also got a 76-episode animated television series in 2006.

A second spin-off series called &quot;Kid Lucky&quot; was created in 1995, aimed at attracting a younger readership. This starred Luke as a little boy, a format that had been very popular with Spirou. Two albums starring this version of the character were released as part of the main series: &quot;Kid Lucky&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma Jim&quot;. These were credited to veteran writer Jean Léturgie and unknown artist Pearce, who was later revealed to be a joint pen name for Yann Lepennetier and Didier Conrad. The series was scrapped due to poor sales and the two albums removed from the official list of Lucky Luke albums. The series was however re-launched in 2011 as &quot;Les aventures de Kid Lucky d&#x27;après Morris&quot;, with Achdé now solely in charge of it. To date, Achdé has written four Kid Lucky albums, &quot;L&#x27;apprenti Cow-boy&quot;, &quot;Lasso périlleux&quot;, &quot;Statue Squaw&quot; and &quot;Suivez la flèche&quot;, released in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. In June 2020, It was announced &quot;Kid Lucky&quot; will be adapted into an animated series.

<text>Jagex Limited is a British video game developer and publisher based at the Cambridge Science Park in Cambridge, England. It is best known for &quot;RuneScape&quot; and &quot;Old School RuneScape&quot;, both free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The company&#x27;s name is derived from the company&#x27;s original slogan, &quot;Java Gaming Experts&quot;.

In addition to &quot;RuneScape&quot;, Jagex has released multiple casual games on its FunOrb portal, as well as other titles. Jagex was owned by U.S. investors between 2012 and 2016, by Chinese investors from 2016 to 2020, by Macarthur Fortune Holding LLC in 2020, by The Carlyle Group from 2020 to 2024, and is presently owned by CVC Capital Partners.

==History==

After initially creating the Jagex name and logo for their projects, brothers and computer programmers Andrew and Paul Gower began trading under the Jagex name in 1999, describing Jagex Software as a &quot;small software company based in England who specialise in producing top-quality Java-games for webpages.&quot; That same year they began work on the MMORPG &quot;RuneScape&quot;, which was released in January 2001. In December 2001, Andrew Gower, Paul Gower, and Constant Tedder launched Jagex in its current incarnation, with Tedder as its CEO. Jagex formally acquired the Jagex name from Andrew Gower in 2001.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; grew dramatically; one year after its release over a million free accounts had been registered. The game was originally supported by advertisements, however, the dot-com bubble meant that there were fewer advertisers. The new company created a paid version of the game with extra features, to support hosting costs and continued development. The pay-to-play version of &quot;RuneScape&quot; was released on 27 February 2002. It gained 2,000 subscribers in the first hour and 5,000 subscribers in the first week, making it one of the largest Java pay-to-play games in the world at the time. In 2007, RuneScape achieved one million subscribers; 11 years after launch, the company touted 200 million accounts.

Until the release of &quot;War of Legends&quot; in 2010, the company used the slogan &quot;Java Gaming Experts&quot; as it had only produced games written in Java up to that point. Following the launch of the Flash-based &quot;War of Legends&quot;, the company name was said to stand for &quot;Just About the Game Experience&quot;.

===Company structure===
As &quot;RuneScape&quot; gained users, Jagex grew. By 11 December 2003, &quot;RuneScape&quot; had 65,000 paying members, and Jagex had 29 employees. On 4 May 2007, &quot;RuneScape&quot; had over 6,000,000 active free accounts and over 1,000,000 active pay-to-play subscribers. By July 2012, Jagex had over 500 employees.

Initially, the company was self-funded; however, in October 2005, Jagex received an investment from Insight Venture Partners. On 23 October 2007, Geoff Iddison, former European REO of PayPal, replaced Constant Tedder as CEO. Iddison resigned as CEO in January 2009, replaced by Mark Gerhard, who had been Jagex CTO before his appointment. Jagex became a member of the United Kingdom&#x27;s game developer trade body, TIGA, on 15 April 2009. Richard Wilson, TIGA&#x27;s CEO, described Jagex as &quot;one of the most successful game developers in the world, not just the UK. Jagex has developed extraordinarily popular games and is at the leading edge in terms of online safety and security.&quot;

In December 2010 The Raine Group and Spectrum Equity Investors invested in the company, while Insight increased their investment. Andrew Gower, Paul Gower, and Constant Tedder left the board of directors at that time. In January 2012, Insight increased its stake in Jagex from 35% to 55%, giving it a controlling interest in the company. However, in an interview, Gerhard stated that Insight took their 55% stake 13 months prior in December 2010. On 11 September 2014, Mark Gerhard announced his resignation from Jagex by 2015. On 2 April 2015, Rod Cousens was appointed CEO of Jagex following his departure from Codemasters. In July 2016 Jagex was purchased by Hongtou, a Chinese investment company, which was subsequently acquired by Zhongji Holdings, which later changed its name to Fukong Interactive Entertainment. Jagex remained under Hongtou within Fukong&#x27;s structure until it was sold to Macarthur Fortune Holding, a US-based asset management company, in April 2020 for .

Phil Mansell became Jagex&#x27; CEO in January 2017. The Carlyle Group acquired a majority stake in the firm in January 2021 from Macarthur in a deal for an undisclosed amount, which &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; estimated was greater than the Macarthur had paid for it previously. After announcement of this, Plutos Sama Holdings filed a legal complaint asserting that the sale of Jagex from Shanghai Hongtou to Macarthur was invalid due to past issues over business dealings with Shanghai Hongtou. Plutos Sama stated in their complaint they had put in a sole bid to acquire Hongtou, including Jagex, around August 2020, but this deal never was complete, but as it should have gone through, they are the rightful owners of Jagex.

In July 2022, Jagex acquired US games company Pipeworks Studios, which was later sold to Virtuos Studios. In December 2022, Jagex acquired Gamepires, a Croatian studio that developed the open world survival game &quot;Scum&quot;.

In February 2024, CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII and Haveli Investments purchased Jagex from the Carlyle Group for £910 million.

===Charity fundraising===
Since 2004 Jagex has made donations to a number of national and international charities, as well as running charity auctions for signed merchandise. 

Jagex has donated artwork and prizes to the MMO Calendar, which raises funds for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

In 2013, Jagex introduced the &quot;Well of Goodwill&quot; to &quot;RuneScape&quot;, which allowed players to gift in-game items or wealth to charity, featuring a hi-scores page for the players who donated. For every 10 million gold pieces from the community, Jagex donated $2 to a range of charitable causes.

In July 2014, Jagex helped raise awareness about the illegal poaching of black and white rhinos by adding rhinoceros pets and trivia questions to &quot;RuneScape&quot;. This campaign was partnered with United for Wildlife.

Jagex raised over £445,000 in 2020, focusing on mental health and diversity and inclusion.

===Developed===
====&quot;RuneScape&quot;====

&quot;RuneScape&quot; is a fantasy MMORPG released in January 2001 by Andrew and Paul Gower. It was originally a graphical browser game implemented on the client-side in Java, and incorporates 3D rendering. The game has over 200 million registered accounts, and is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s most popular free-to-play MMORPG.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; takes place in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms, regions, and cities. Each region offers different types of monsters, resources, and quests to challenge players. The game&#x27;s fictional universe has also been explored through a tie-in video game on its maker&#x27;s other website, &quot;FunOrb&quot;, &quot;Armies of Gielinor&quot;, and the novels &quot;Betrayal at Falador&quot;, &quot;Return to Canifis&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Blood&quot;.

Players are represented in the game with customisable avatars. &quot;RuneScape&quot; does not follow a linear storyline; rather, players set their own goals and objectives. Players can choose to fight non-player character (NPC) monsters, complete quests, or increase their experience in the available skills. Players interact with each other through trading, chatting, or by participating in mini-games and activities, some of which are competitive or combative in nature, while others require cooperative or collaborative play.

<text>Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort or MCAS Beaufort is a United States Marine Corps (USMC) air base located northwest of the central business district of Beaufort, a city in Beaufort County, South Carolina, United States. About 4,700 personnel serve at the station, and it is home to three Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet fighter-attack squadrons and two F-35B Lighting II squadrons.

Beaufort is served by the Beaufort County Airport , located southeast of MCAS Beaufort.

==History==

Naval Air Station Beaufort was commissioned on 15 June 1943, for advanced training operations of anti-submarine patrols during World War II. It was deactivated in 1946 and reactivated in 1956.

On 1 March 1960, it was re-designated Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort.

On 19 September 1975, the airfield was named Merritt Field in honor of Major General Lewie G. Merritt, USMC, a 1917 graduate of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina. A native of Ridge Spring, Merritt was a Marine Aviation pioneer who served in both World Wars and commanded several major flying units in the South Pacific during World War II, after retirement he also served as legal counsel to the South Carolina Legislature.

The air station encompasses 6,900 acres (28 km2). It is also associated with a large air-to-air combat area off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia as well as the Townsend Bombing Range, a 5,200 acre (21 km2) air-to-ground combat and bombing range in McIntosh County, Georgia. Attached to the base is also the housing complex of Laurel Bay, three miles (5 km) from the station, that provides family housing for area servicemembers.

Formerly home to USMC F-8 Crusader and F-4 Phantom II operations, MCAS Beaufort currently hosts all active duty USMC F/A-18 air operations on the East Coast, said aircraft and squadrons being assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31). The mission of MCAS Beaufort is to provide support as an operational base for MAG-31 and its associated squadrons, Marine Corps support units and tenant U.S. Navy strike fighter squadrons. The mission of the Marine Aircraft Group is to conduct anti-air-warfare and offensive air support operations in support of Fleet Marine Forces from advanced bases, expeditionary airfields, or aircraft carriers and conduct such other air operations as may be directed. Two Navy F/A-18 strike fighter squadrons under the claimancy of Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic at NAS Oceana, Virginia were also previously homeported at MCAS Beaufort. The population of the on-base &quot;city&quot; includes nearly 4,000 active-duty servicemembers and more than 700 civilian workers.

As is the case with many air bases, MCAS Beaufort hosts a bi-annual air show open to the public. In April 2007, a fatal crash occurred involving an aircraft from the Blue Angels demonstration team during the show.

MCAS Beaufort&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Fightertown East&quot;. MCAS Miramar in San Diego, California is the more commonly known &quot;Fightertown&quot;, also called &quot;Fightertown USA&quot;, the latter having acquired the nickname when it was under Navy control as NAS Miramar.

MCAS Beaufort&#x27;s Dental Clinic shares a building with the Medical Clinic. The Dental Clinic has five to seven dentists who support the squadrons&#x27; oral health care needs.

The 1979 film &quot;The Great Santini&quot;, based on a novel written by Pat Conroy which centered on MCAS Beaufort in the early 1960s, was filmed on base and in the local area.

==Education==

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) is the local school district for the following people living on the property of MCAS Beaufort: children of Department of Defense employees living in the permanent housing, and children of civilians working for the United States federal government living in the permanent housing. The DoDEA operates Elliott Elementary School (PreKindergarten-Grade 2) and Bolden Elementary/Middle School (grades 3-8).

Beaufort County School District (BCSD) operates public high schools serving MCAS Beaufort, and in sum has the highest number of students, of any school system, affiliated with MCAS Beaufort. Battery Creek High School is the zoned public high school for MCAS Beaufort. Additionally, while BCSD does not specify school zoning for MCAS Beaufort for the elementary level, in 2024 it stated that Robert Smalls International Academy is the zoned middle school.

<text>Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (often abbreviated as MCRD PI) is an military installation located within Port Royal, South Carolina, approximately south of Beaufort, the community that is typically associated with the installation. MCRD Parris Island is used for United States Marine Corps Recruit Training of enlisted United States Marines. Recruits living east of the Mississippi River report there to receive initial training. Recruits living west of the Mississippi River receive training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California, but may train at MCRD Parris Island by special request.

==Initial settlements==
A French Huguenot expedition, led by Jean Ribault in 1562, was the first European group to attempt to colonize Parris Island. Earlier Spanish expeditions had sighted the area and named it &quot;Punta de Santa Elena&quot;, which now remains one of the oldest continuously used European place names in the United States. The French expedition built an outpost named Charlesfort, and Ribault left a small garrison as he returned to France for colonists and supplies.

After a long absence because of Ribault&#x27;s delay from wars in Europe, Charlesfort was abandoned after the garrison mutinied, built a ship on the island and sailed back to France in April 1563. In 1566, the Spanish, led by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, founded a settlement named Santa Elena which became the capital of La Florida for the next decade. In May 1586, English forces under Francis Drake carried out a raid on St. Augustine further south. Fearing another raid, both Santa Elena and Parris Island were abandoned by the Spanish the following year.

After coming under English control, the island was granted to Robert Daniell in 1706 and became known as Port Royal Island. It later came into the hands of Colonel Alexander Parris, the Public Treasurer of South Carolina. After his death 1736, it gradually became known as Parris Island (and the name Port Royal Island was applied to a different island to the north).

From the 1720s to the Civil War, the island was divided into several plantations, initially growing indigo then later cotton. During and after the Civil War, the island became home to freed slaves and was a site of freedmen schools taught by abolitionists such as Frances Gage and Clara Barton. Union forces captured Port Royal Sound in 1861, and Parris Island became a coaling station for the Navy. This function was taken up again after the war in large part because of the freedman-turned-Representative Robert Smalls, who fought for the creation of a federal military installation on the island.

==Military use==

Marines were first assigned to Parris Island on June 26, 1891, in the form of a small security detachment headed by First Sergeant Richard Donovan, two corporals and 10 privates. This unit was attached to the Naval Station, Port Royal, South Carolina, the forerunner of Parris Island. Donovan&#x27;s unit was highly commended for preserving life and property during hurricanes and storm surges that swept over the island in 1891 and 1893.

Military buildings and family quarters constructed between 1891 and World War I form the nucleus of the Parris Island Historic District. At the district center are the commanding general&#x27;s home, a 19th-century wooden dry dock, and an early 20th-century gazebo, all of which are on the National Register of Historic Places.

On November 1, 1915, Parris Island was officially designated a Recruit Depot, and United States Marine Corps Recruit Training has continued there since then. In the early years of the Marine Corps presence it was referred to as Paris Island.

Prior to 1929, a ferry provided all transportation to and from the island from Port Royal docks to the Recruit Depot docks. That year, a causeway and a bridge over Archer&#x27;s Creek were completed. The causeway was dedicated as the General E. A. Pollock Memorial Causeway in April 1984.

In the month following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 5,272 recruits arrived there with 9,206 arriving in January 1942, making it necessary to add the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Recruit Training Battalions. As the war influx continued, five battalions were sent to New River, North Carolina, to train, and the Depot expanded to 13 battalions. From 1941 to 1945, the Marines trained 204,509 recruits there, and at the time of the Japanese surrender, the Depot contained more than 20,000 recruits.

On February 15, 1949, the Marines activated a separate &quot;command&quot; for the sole purpose of training female recruits. Later, the command was designated the 4th Recruit Training Battalion.

The Korean War began in 1950, when 2,350 recruits were in training. From then until the 1st Marine Division withdrew from Korea, Parris Island drill instructors trained more than 138,000 recruits. In March 1952, the training load peaked at 24,424 recruits. The recruit tide again flooded during the years of the Vietnam War, reaching a peak training load of 10,979 during March 1966.

On the night of April 8, 1956, the Ribbon Creek incident resulted in the drowning of six recruits, which led to widespread changes in recruit training policies. Supervision of drill instructors was expanded, such as the introduction of the series commander.

On October 11, 2002, the town of Port Royal annexed the entire island, but most visitors still associate the installation with Beaufort, a larger community five miles to the north.

On June 17, 2011, Brigadier General Lori Reynolds became the first female commander of the base. On June 20, 2014, Brigadier General Terry Williams became the first African-American commander of the base.

== Recruit training ==

The Marines train about 17,000 recruits at Parris Island each year. Recruit training for those enlisted in the United States Marine Corps includes a thirteen-week process during which the recruit becomes cut off from the civilian world and must adapt to a Marine Corps lifestyle. During training, the drill instructors train recruits in a wide variety of subjects including weapons training, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, personal hygiene and cleanliness, close order drill, and Marine Corps history. The training emphasizes physical fitness and combat effectiveness. Recruits must attain a minimum standard of fitness to graduate. This standard includes a Physical Fitness Test and a Combat Fitness Test. Recruits must also meet minimum combat-oriented swimming qualifications, qualify in rifle marksmanship with the M16A4 service rifle, pass minimum curriculum standards, and complete a 54-hour simulated combat exercise known as &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

The facility has trained female U.S. Marine recruits since 1949. The facility also has female drill instructors.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
* Parris Island is depicted in the film &quot;The D.I.&quot; (1957), directed by and starring Jack Webb.
* Parris Island is depicted most famously in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s movie &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), featuring R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a memorable drill instructor (&quot;DI&quot;). Ermey was formerly a Marine DI at San Diego and served as technical consultant on building the film set.

===Television===
* Parris Island appears in and is referenced several times in the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; franchise. Professional wrestler/&quot;G.I. Joe&quot; character Sgt. Slaughter (portrayed by/voiced by Bob Remus) was billed from/born in Parris Island, South Carolina and was known as the &quot;toughest drill instructor&quot; to come out of MCRD. &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; character Gung-Ho graduated from Parris Island; another character, Leatherneck, served as a drill instructor there. Parris Island appears in the episode &quot;The Rotten Egg&quot; of the original &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; cartoon.
* The &quot;JAG&quot; episode titled &quot;Boot&quot; was set at MCRD.
* Parris Island is the setting of several flashbacks in the TV series &quot;Revolution&quot;.

===Music===
*Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot; mentions the U.S. Marine Corps training base multiple times (&quot;We met as soulmates on Parris Island&quot;).

<doc id="546341" wikidata="Q1140550" url="?curid=546341" title="Extended Unix Code">
<text>Extended Unix Code (EUC) is a multibyte character encoding system used primarily for Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese (characters).

The most commonly used EUC codes are variable-length encodings with a character belonging to an compliant coded character set (such as ASCII) taking one byte, and a character belonging to a 94×94 coded character set (such as ) represented in two bytes. The EUC-CN form of and EUC-KR are examples of such two-byte EUC codes. EUC-JP includes characters represented by up to three bytes, including an initial , whereas a single character in EUC-TW can take up to four bytes.

Modern applications are more likely to use UTF-8, which supports all of the glyphs of the EUC codes, and more, and is generally more portable with fewer vendor deviations and errors. EUC is however still very popular, especially EUC-KR for South Korea.

==Encoding structure==
The structure of EUC is based on the standard, which specifies a system of graphical character sets that can be represented with a sequence of the 94 7-bit bytes 0x21–7E, or alternatively 0xA1–FE if an eighth bit is available. This allows for sets of 94 graphical characters, or 8836 (942) characters, or 830584 (943) characters. Although initially 0x20 and 0x7F were always the space and and 0xA0 and 0xFF were unused, later editions of allowed the use of the bytes 0xA0 and 0xFF (or 0x20 and 0x7F) within sets under certain circumstances, allowing the inclusion of 96-character sets. The ranges 0x00–1F and 0x80–9F are used for C0 and C1 control codes.

EUC is a family of 8-bit profiles of , as opposed to 7-bit profiles such as ISO-2022-JP. As such, only compliant character sets can have EUC forms. Up to four coded character sets (referred to as G0, G1, G2, and G3 or as code sets 0, 1, 2, and 3) can be represented with the EUC scheme. The G0 set is set to an compliant coded character set such as ASCII, () or (the lower half of ) and invoked over GL (i.e. 0x21–0x7E, with the most significant bit cleared). If ASCII is used, this makes the code an extended ASCII encoding; the most common deviation from ASCII is that 0x5C (backslash in ASCII) is often used to represent a yen sign in EUC-JP (see below) and a won sign in EUC-KR.

The other code sets are invoked over GR (i.e. with the most significant bit set). Hence, to get the EUC form of a character, the most significant bit of each coding byte is set (equivalent to adding 128 to each 7-bit coding byte, or adding 160 to each number in the kuten code); this allows the software to easily distinguish whether a particular byte in a character string belongs to the code or the extended code. Characters in code sets 2 and 3 are prefixed with the control codes (0x8E) and (0x8F) respectively, and invoked over GR. Besides the initial shift code, any byte outside of the range 0xA0–0xFF appearing in a character from code sets 1 through 3 is not a valid EUC code.

The EUC code itself does not make use of the announcement and designation sequences from . However, the code specification is equivalent to the following sequence of four announcement sequences, with meanings breaking down as follows.

===Fixed-length format===
The ISO-2022-based variable-length encoding described above is sometimes referred to as the &quot;EUC packed format&quot;, which is the encoding format usually labeled as EUC. However, internal processing of EUC data may make use of a fixed-length transformation format called the EUC complete two-byte format. This represents:

* Code set 0 as two bytes in the range 0x21–0x7E (except that the first may be 0x00).
* Code set 1 as two bytes in the range 0xA0–0xFF (except that the first may be 0x80).
* Code set 2 as a byte in the range 0x21–0x7E (or 0x00) followed by a byte in the range 0xA0–0xFF.
* Code set 3 as a byte in the range 0xA0–0xFF (or 0x80) followed by a byte in the range 0x21–0x7E.

Initial bytes of 0x00 and 0x80 are used in cases where the code set uses only one byte. There is also a four-byte fixed-length format. These fixed-length encoding formats are suited to internal processing and are not usually encountered in interchange.

EUC-JP is registered with the IANA in both formats, the packed format as &quot;EUC-JP&quot; or &quot;csEUCPkdFmtJapanese&quot; and the fixed width format as &quot;csEUCFixWidJapanese&quot;. Only the packed format is included in the WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5.

==EUC-CN==
EUC-CN is the usual encoded form of the standard for simplified Chinese characters. Unlike the case of Japanese JIS X 0208 and ISO-2022-JP, is not normally used in a 7-bit code version, although a variant form called HZ (which delimits text with ASCII sequences) was sometimes used on USENET.

An ASCII character is represented in its usual encoding. A character from is represented by two bytes, both from the range 0xA1–0xFE.

===748 code===
An encoding related to EUC-CN is the &quot;748&quot; code used in the WITS typesetting system developed by Beijing&#x27;s Founder Technology (now obsoleted by its newer FITS typesetting system). The 748 code contains all of , but is not –compliant and therefore not a true EUC code. (It uses an 8-bit lead byte but distinguishes between a second byte with its most significant bit set and one with its most significant bit cleared, and is, therefore, more similar in structure to Big5 and other non–ISO 2022–compliant DBCS encoding systems.) The non-GB2312 portion of the 748 code contains traditional and Hong Kong characters and other glyphs used in newspaper typesetting.

===IBM code pages 1380, 1381, 1382 and 1383===
IBM code page 1381 (CCSID 1381) comprises the single-byte code page 1115 (CPGID 1115 as CCSID 1115) and the double-byte code page 1380 (CPGID 1380 as CCSID 1380), which encodes GB 2312 the same way as EUC-CN, but deviates from the EUC structure by extending the lead byte range back to 0x8C, adding 31 IBM-selected characters in 0x8CE0 through 0x8CFE and adding 1880 user-defined characters with lead bytes 0x8D through 0xA0.

IBM code page 1383 (CCSID 1383) comprises the single-byte code page 367 and the double-byte code page 1382 (CPGID 1382 as CCSID 1382), which differs by conforming to the EUC structure, adding the 31 IBM-selected characters in 0xFEE0 through 0xFEFE instead, and including only 1360 user-defined characters, interspersed in the positions not used by GB 2312. The alternative CCSID 5479 is used for the pure EUC-CN code page: it uses CCSID 9574 as its double-byte set, which uses CPGID 1382 but excludes the IBM-selected and user-defined characters.

===GBK and GB 18030===

GBK is an extension to . It defines an extended form of the EUC-CN encoding capable of representing a larger array of CJK characters sourced largely from , including traditional Chinese characters and characters used only in Japanese. It is not, however, a true EUC code, because ASCII bytes may appear as trail bytes (and C1 bytes, not limited to the single shifts, may appear as lead or trail bytes), due to a larger encoding space being required.

Variants of GBK are implemented by Windows code page 936 (the Microsoft Windows code page for simplified Chinese), and by IBM&#x27;s code page 1386.

The Unicode-based character encoding defines an extension of GBK capable of encoding the entirety of Unicode. However, Unicode encoded as is a variable-length encoding which may use up to four bytes per character, due to an even larger encoding space being required. Being an extension of GBK, it is a superset of EUC-CN but is not itself a true EUC code. Being a Unicode encoding, its repertoire is identical to that of other Unicode transformation formats such as UTF-8.

===Mac OS Chinese Simplified===
Other EUC-CN variants deviating from the EUC mechanism include the Mac OS Chinese Simplified script (known as Code page 10008 or codice_1). It uses the bytes 0x80, 0x81, 0x82, 0xA0, 0xFD, 0xFE, and 0xFF for the U with umlaut (ü), two special font metric characters, the non-breaking space, the copyright sign (©), the trademark sign (™) and the ellipsis (...) respectively. This differs in what is regarded as a single-byte character versus the first byte of a two-byte character from both EUC (where, of those, 0xFD and 0xFE are defined as lead bytes) and GBK (where, of those, 0x81, 0x82, 0xFD and 0xFE are defined as lead bytes).

This use of 0xA0, 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF matches Apple&#x27;s Shift_JIS variant.

Besides these changes to the lead byte range, the other distinctive feature of the double-byte portion of Mac OS Chinese Simplified is the inclusion of two extensions to the basic GB 2312-80 set in rows 6 and 8. These are considered &quot;standard extensions to GB 2312&quot;, neither of which is proprietary to Apple: the row 8 extension was taken from GB 6345.1, both extensions are included by GB/T 12345 (the traditional Chinese variant of GB 2312), and both extensions are included by GB 18030 (the successor to GB 2312).

==EUC-JP==

EUC-JP is a variable-length encoding used to represent the elements of three Japanese character set standards, namely , , and . Other names for this encoding include Unixized JIS (or UJIS) and AT&amp;T JIS. 0.1% of all web pages use EUC-JP since September 2022, while 2.6% of websites written with Japanese use this second-most popular (for Japanese) encoding (which is more than for Shift JIS both are much less used that UTF-8). It is called Code page 954 by IBM. Microsoft has two code page numbers for this encoding (51932 and 20932).

This encoding scheme allows the easy mixing of 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit Japanese without the need for the escape characters employed by ISO-2022-JP, which is based on the same character set standards, and without ASCII bytes appearing as trail bytes (unlike Shift JIS).

A related and partially compatible encoding, called EUC-JISx0213 or EUC-JIS-2004, encodes and (similarly to , its Shift_JIS-based counterpart).

Compared to EUC-CN or EUC-KR, EUC-JP did not become as widely adopted on PC and Macintosh systems in Japan, which used or its extensions (Windows code page 932 on Microsoft Windows, and MacJapanese on classic Mac OS), although it became heavily used by Unix or Unix-like operating systems (except for HP-UX). Therefore, whether Japanese websites use EUC-JP or Shift_JIS often depends on what OS the author uses.

Characters are encoded as follows:

* As an EUC/ISO 2022 compliant encoding, the C0 control characters, space, and DEL are represented as in ASCII.
* A graphical character from ASCII (code set 0) is represented as its usual one-byte representation, in the range 0x21 – 0x7E. While some variants of EUC-JP encode the lower half of here, most encode ASCII, including the W3C/WHATWG Encoding standard used by HTML5, and so does EUC-JIS-2004. While this means that 0x5C is typically mapped to Unicode as U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS (the ASCII backslash), U+005C may be displayed as a Yen sign by certain Japanese-locale fonts, e.g. on Microsoft Windows, for compatibility with the lower half of .
* A character from JIS X 0208 (code set 1) is represented by two bytes, both in the range 0xA1 – 0xFE. This differs from the ISO-2022-JP representation by having the high bit set. This code set may also contain vendor extensions in some EUC-JP variants. In EUC-JIS-2004, the first plane of is encoded here, which is effectively a superset of standard .
* A character from the &quot;upper half&quot; of (half-width kana, code set 2) is represented by two bytes, the first being 0x8E, the second being the usual representation in the range 0xA1 – 0xDF. This set may contain IBM vendor extensions in some variants.
* A character from JIS X 0212 (code set 3) is represented in EUC-JP by three bytes, the first being 0x8F, the following two being in the range 0xA1–0xFE, i.e. with the high bit set. In addition to standard , code set 3 of some EUC-JP variants may also contain extensions in rows 83 and 84 to represent characters from IBM&#x27;s Shift JIS extensions which lack standard JIS X 0212 mappings, which may be coded in either of two layouts, one defined by IBM themselves and one defined by the OSF. In EUC-JIS-2004, the second plane of is encoded here, which does not collide with the allocated rows in standard . Some implementations of EUC-JIS-2004, such as the one used by Python, allow both and plane 2 characters in this set.

Vendor extensions to EUC-JP (from, for example, the Open Software Foundation, IBM or NEC) were often allocated within the individual code sets, as opposed to using invalid EUC sequences (as in popular extensions of EUC-CN and EUC-KR).

However, some vendor-specific encodings are partially compatible with EUC-JP, due to encoding over GR, but do not follow the packed EUC structure. Often, these do not include use of the single shifts from EUC-JP, and are thus not straight extensions of EUC-JP, with the exception of Super DEC Kanji.

===DEC Kanji===
Digital Equipment Corporation defines two variants of EUC-JP only partly conforming to the EUC packed format, but also bearing some resemblance to the complete two-byte format. The overall format of the &quot;DEC Kanji&quot; encoding mostly corresponds to fixed-length (complete two-byte) EUC; however, code set 0 is not required to be left-padded with null bytes (similarly to the packed format). JIS X 0208 is, as usual, used for code set 1; code set 2 (half-width katakana) is absent; code set 3 is encoded like the two-byte fixed width format (i.e. without a shift byte and with only the first high bit set), but used for two-byte user defined characters rather than being specified for JIS X 0212. In the basic &quot;DEC Kanji&quot; encoding, only the first 31 rows of code set 3 are used for user-defined characters: rows 32 through 94 are reserved, similarly to the unused rows in code set 1.

The &quot;Super DEC Kanji&quot; encoding accepts codes both from the &quot;DEC Kanji&quot; encoding and from packed-format EUC, for a total of five code-sets. It also allows the entire user defined code set, and the unused rows at the ends of the JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212 code sets (rows 85–94 and 78–94 respectively), to be used for user-defined characters.

===HP-16===
Hewlett-Packard defines an encoding referred to as &quot;HP-16&quot;. This accompanies their &quot;HP-15&quot; encoding, which is a variant of Shift JIS. HP-16 encodes using the same bytes as in EUC-JP, but does not use the single shift codes (thus omitting code sets 2 and 3), and adds three user-defined regions which do not follow the packed-format EUC structure:

* Lead bytes 0xA1–C2, trail bytes 0x21–7E
* Lead bytes 0xC3–E3, trail bytes 0x21–3F
* Lead bytes 0xC3–E1, trail bytes 0x40–64

===IKIS===
The IKIS (Interactive Kanji Information System) encoding used by Data General resembles EUC-JP without single shifts, i.e. with only code sets 0 and 1. Half-width katakana are instead included in row 8 of JIS X 0208 (colliding with the box-drawing characters added to the standard in 1983). JIS X 0208 rows 9 through 12 are used for user-defined characters.

===Adaptations of EUC-JP for EBCDIC===
KEIS (Kanji-processing Extended Information System) is an EBCDIC encoding used by Hitachi, with double-byte characters (a DBCS-Host encoding) included using shifting sequences, making it a stateful encoding. Specifically, the sequence switches to single-byte mode and the sequence switches to double-byte mode. However, JIS X 0208 characters are encoded using the same byte sequences used to encode them in EUC-JP. This results in duplicate encodings for the —0x4040 per the DBCS-Host code structure, and 0xA1A1 as in EUC-JP. This differs from IBM&#x27;s DBCS-Host encoding for Japanese, the layout of which builds on versions which predate JIS X 0208 altogether. The lead byte range is extended back to 0x59, out of which the lead bytes 0x81–A0 are designated for user-defined characters, and the remainder are used for corporate-defined characters, including both kanji and non-kanji.

JEF (Japanese-processing Extended Feature) is an EBCDIC encoding used on Fujitsu FACOM mainframes, contrasting with FMR (a variant of Shift JIS) used on Fujitsu PCs. Like KEIS, JEF is a stateful encoding, switching to a double-byte DBCS-Host mode using shifting sequences (where switches to single-byte mode and switches to double-byte mode). Also similarly to KEIS, codes are represented the same as in EUC-JP. The lead byte range is extended back to 0x41, with 0x80–0xA0 designated for user definition; lead bytes 0x41–0x7F are assigned row numbers 101 through 163 for kuten purposes, although row 162 (lead byte 0x7E) is unused. Rows 101 through 148 are used for extended kanji, while rows 149 through 163 are used for extended non-kanji.

==EUC-KR==

EUC-KR is a variable-length encoding to represent Korean text using two coded character sets, (formerly KS C 5601) and either (, formerly ) or ASCII, depending on variant. (formerly ) stipulates the encoding and dubbed it as EUC-KR.

A character drawn from KS X 1001 (G1, code set 1) is encoded as two bytes in GR (0xA1–0xFE) and a character from or ASCII (G0, code set 0) takes one byte in GL (0x21–0x7E).

It is usually referred to as Wansung () in the Republic of Korea. IBM refers to the double-byte component as Code page 971, and to EUC-KR with ASCII as Code page 970. It is implemented as Code page 20949 (&quot;Korean Wansung&quot;) and Code page 51949 (&quot;EUC Korean&quot;) by Microsoft.

, less than 0.065% of all web pages globally declare using EUC-KR, but 5.0% of South Korean web pages use EUC-KR. Including extensions, it is the most widely used legacy character encoding in Korea on all three major platforms (macOS, other Unix-like OSes, and Windows), but its use has been very slowly shifting to UTF-8 as it gains popularity, especially on Linux and macOS.

As with most other encodings, UTF-8 is now preferred for new use, solving problems with consistency between platforms and vendors.

===Unified Hangul Code===
A common extension of EUC-KR is the Unified Hangul Code (, or ), which is the default Korean codepage on Microsoft Windows. It is given the code page number 949 by Microsoft, and 1261 or 1363 by IBM. IBM&#x27;s code page 949 is a different, unrelated, EUC-KR extension.

Unified Hangul Code extends EUC-KR by using codes that do not conform to the EUC structure to incorporate additional syllable blocks, completing the coverage of the composed syllable blocks available in Johab and Unicode. The W3C/WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5 incorporates the Unified Hangul Code extensions into its definition of EUC-KR.

===Mac OS Korean (HangulTalk)===
Other encodings incorporating EUC-KR as a subset include the Mac OS Korean script (known as Code page 10003 or codice_2), which was used by HangulTalk (MacOS-KH), the Korean localization of the classic Mac OS. It was developed by Elex Computer (), who were at the time the authorised distributor of Apple Macintosh computers in South Korea.

HangulTalk adds extension characters with lead bytes between 0xA1 and 0xAD, both in unused space within the EUC-KR GR plane (trail bytes 0xA1–0xFE), and using non-EUC codes outside of it (trail bytes 0x41–0xA0). Some of these characters are font-style-independent stylized dingbats. Many of these characters do not have exact Unicode mappings, and Apple software maps these cases variously to combining sequences, to approximate mappings with an appended private-use character as a modifier for round-trip purposes, or to private-use characters.

Apple also uses certain single-byte codes outside of the EUC-KR plane for additional characters: 0x80 for a required space, 0x81 for a won sign (₩), 0x82 for an en dash (–), 0x83 for a copyright sign (), 0x84 for a wide underscore () and 0xFF for an ellipsis (...). Although none of these additional single-byte codes are within the lead byte range of plain EUC-KR (unlike Apple&#x27;s extensions to EUC-CN, see above), some are within the lead byte range of Unified Hangul Code (specifically, 0x81, 0x82, 0x83 and 0x84).

==EUC-KP==
Similarly to KS X 1001, the North Korean KPS 9566 standard is typically used in EUC form; in these contexts, it is sometimes referred to as EUC-KP. More recent editions of the standard extend the EUC representation with characters using non-EUC two-byte codes, in a similar manner to Unified Hangul Code.

==EUC-TH==
Although certain single-byte encodings such as the ISO/IEC 8859 series technically conform to the EUC structure, they are rarely labeled as EUC. However, is used on Solaris as a label for TIS-620.

==EUC-TW==
EUC-TW is a variable-length encoding that supports ASCII and 16 planes of , each of which is 94×94. It is a rarely used encoding for traditional Chinese characters as used in Taiwan. Variants of Big5 are much more common than EUC-TW, although Big5 only encodes the first two planes of CNS 11643 hanzi, while UTF-8 is becoming more common.

* As an EUC/ISO 2022 encoding, the C0 control characters, ASCII space, and DEL are encoded as in ASCII.
* A graphical character from ASCII (G0, code set 0) is encoded in GL as its usual single-byte representation (0x21–0x7E).
* A character from CNS 11643 plane 1 (code set 1) is encoded as two bytes in GR (0xA1–0xFE).
* A character in planes 1 through 16 of CNS 11643 (code set 2) is encoded as four bytes:
** The first byte is always 0x8E (Single Shift 2).
** The second byte (0xA1–0xB0) indicates the plane, the number of which is obtained by subtracting 0xA0 from that byte.
** The third and fourth bytes are in GR (0xA1–0xFE).

Note that plane 1 of CNS 11643 is encoded twice as code set 1 and a part of code set 2.

<text>Ellwangen an der Jagst, officially Ellwangen (Jagst), in common use simply Ellwangen () is a town in the district of Ostalbkreis in the east of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. It is situated about north of Aalen.

Ellwangen has 25,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Ellwangen is situated in the valley of the river Jagst, between the foothills of the Swabian Alb and Virngrund (ancient Virgundia) forest, the latter being part of the Swabian-Franconian Forest. The Jagst runs through Ellwangen from south to north.

==History==
The town developed in the 7th century as an Alemannic settlement in the Virgunna forest next to the Franconian-Swabian border. In 764 the Frankish noble Hariolf, Bishop of Langres, founded a Benedictine monastery, Ellwangen Abbey, on a hill next to the settlement. The monastery was mentioned in a document of Louis the Pious as &quot;Elehenuuwang&quot; in 814. It became a &quot;Reichsabtei&quot; in 817.

From 870 to 873 the Byzantine Greek &quot;Apostle of the Slavs&quot; Saint Methodius was imprisoned in Ellwangen, after he had been arrested by Ermanrich, bishop of Passau. He was set free in 873 thanks to the intervention of Pope John VIII.

The monastery was &quot;exempt&quot; from 1124 on (maybe earlier), which means it was directly responsible to the pope. The abbots were granted &quot;Reichsfreiheit&quot; in 1215. The office of &quot;Vogt&quot; was first held by the counts of Oettingen, from 1370 on by the counts of Württemberg. In 1460 the abbey was converted into an exempt house of secular canons, led by a prince-provost and a chapter consisting of 12 noble canons and 10 vicars. Initially its territory included the districts of Ellwangen, Tannenberg and Kochenburg. The district of Rötlen was acquired in 1471, Wasseralfingen in 1545, and Heuchlingen in 1609.
In 1588 and from 1611 to 1618 about 450 people in Ellwangen were killed in witch-hunts.

After the German Mediatisation of 1802, Ellwangen became a part of the duchy of Württemberg. At first it was the government seat of Neuwürttemberg, the territories Württemberg had acquired by mediatisation. In 1803 the town became centre of a district (&quot;Oberamt&quot;), which in 1806 was included into the new Kingdom of Württemberg. In 1807 Ellwangen became seat of the &quot;Jagstkreis&quot; (Jagst District), until the district was merged into a larger unit in 1924. The king of Württemberg, who had acquired large areas with a predominantly Roman Catholic population, wanted Ellwangen to become the seat of a Roman Catholic diocese. To achieve this, in 1812 he founded an ordinary and a seminary, as well as a Roman Catholic theological faculty. The faculty was soon moved to Tübingen, where it became part of Eberhard Karls University. In 1817, the seminary and the ordinary went to Rottenburg am Neckar, which in 1821 became the seat of the newly formed diocese for Württemberg.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

During World War I, in 1916–1917, Germany operated a special prisoner-of-war camp for ethnic Polish officers from the Russian Army, with the aim of subjecting them to propaganda and conscripting them into a planned German-controlled Polish army to fight against Russia (Poland was partitioned between Germany, Russia and Austria at the time).

After World War II members of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division were convicted of a number of war crimes, involving the shooting of foreign concentration camp prisoners in Ellwangen during the war.

In April 1945, US Army troops occupied Ellwangen and until 1946, stationed various Army units at the kaserne — the former German Tank School. From 1946 the International Refugee Organisation (IRO) used the kaserne as a displaced persons&#x27; camp for 3,000 Ukrainian refugees until 1951. In 1951, the US Army — the combat engineer battalion and medical battalion of the 28th Infantry Division again took over the facility. In September 1955 the Americans returned the kaserne to the German government.

In April and May 2018, two police raids at a migrant shelter in the town led to national and international media attention and a public debate about legal deportations.

==Transport==

Ellwangen is served by the Upper Jagst Railway which is operated by both GoAhead and Deutsche Bahn. There are also several regional bus lines operated by FahrBus Ostalb. Ellwangen also is a &quot;City Stop&quot; for the Inter-City Train line of Deutsche Bahn. Since 2014, a so called Stadtbus Ellwangen was established. A Stadtbus only stops if requested by the passengers and was established for older residents and the population surrounding the historic center of the town.

==Buildings==

Sights of the city are the medieval town centre with its churches, notably Ellwangen Basilica. Also well known are the Baroque pilgrimage church, Schönenberg, and the castle, both on hills near to the city.

==Mayors since 1819==

<doc id="546348" wikidata="Q1421973" url="?curid=546348" title="GB 2312">
<text> is a key official character set of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, used for Simplified Chinese characters. GB2312 is the registered internet name for EUC-CN, which is its usual encoded form. &quot;GB&quot; refers to the Guobiao standards (国家标准), whereas the &quot;T&quot; suffix () denotes a non-mandatory standard.

 was originally a mandatory national standard designated . However, following a National Standard Bulletin of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 2017, GB 2312 is no longer mandatory, and its standard code is modified to . has been superseded by GBK and GB 18030, which include additional characters, but remains in widespread use as a subset of those encodings.

, GB2312 is the second-most popular encoding served from China and territories (after UTF-8), with 5.5% of web servers serving a page declaring it. Globally, GB2312 is declared on 0.1% of all web pages. However, all major web browsers decode GB2312-marked documents as if they were marked with the superset GBK encoding, except for Safari and Edge on the label codice_1.

There is an analogous character set known as [[GB/T 12345]] &quot;Code of Chinese ideogram set for information interchange supplementary set&quot;, which supplements GB/T 2312 with traditional character forms by replacing simplified forms in their qūwèi code, and some extra 62 supplemental characters. GB-encoded fonts often come in pairs, one with the GB/T 2312 (simplified) character set and the other with the GB/T 12345 (traditional) character set. There exists more GB supplementary encoding sets that supplements GB/T 2312, including GB/T 7589 &quot;Code of Chinese ideograms set forinformation interchange--The 2nd supplementary set&quot; and GB/T 7590 &quot;Code of Chinese ideograms set forinformation interchange--The 4th supplementary set&quot; which provides additional [Variant Chinese characters|variant characters] in the same &quot;qūwèi&quot; encoding format (later used in ISO-2022-CN), but has no relation with characters encoded in GB/T 2312.
== Character range in rows ==
While GB/T 2312 covers over 99.99% contemporary Chinese text usage, historical texts and many names remain out of scope. Old standard includes 6,763 Chinese characters (on two levels: the first is arranged by reading, the second by radical then number of strokes), along with symbols and punctuation, Japanese kana, the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets, Zhuyin, and a double-byte set of Pinyin letters with tone marks. In later version GB/T 2312-1980, there are 7,445 letters.

Characters in GB/T 2312 are arranged in a 94×94 grid (as in ISO 2022), and the two-byte code point of each character is expressed in the &quot;qūwèi&quot; () form, which specifies a row () and the position of the character within the row (cell; ). (This structure is the same as used by other ISO-2022-based national CJK character set standards; compare kuten.) For example, the character &quot;外&quot; (meaning: foreign) is located in row 45 position 66, thus its &quot;qūwèi&quot; code is 45-66.

The rows (numbered from 1 to 94) contain characters as follows:

* 01–09, comprising punctuation and other special characters; also Hiragana, Katakana, Greek, Cyrillic, Pinyin, Bopomofo
* 16–55, the first level of Chinese characters, arranged according to Pinyin. (3755 characters).
* 56–87, the second level of Chinese characters, arranged according to radical and strokes. (3008 characters).

The rows 10–15 and 88–94 are unassigned.

For GB/T 2312-1980, it contains 682 signs and 6763 Chinese Characters.

== Encodings of GB/T 2312 ==

=== EUC-CN ===
EUC-CN is often used as the character encoding (i.e. for external storage) in programs that deal with GB/T 2312, thus maintaining compatibility with ASCII. Two bytes are used to represent every character not found in ASCII. The value of the first byte is from codice_2 (161–247), while the value of the second byte is from codice_3 (161–254). Since all of these ranges are beyond ASCII, like UTF-8, it is possible to check if a byte is part of a multi-byte construct when using EUC-CN, but not if a byte is first or last.

Compared to UTF-8, GB/T 2312 (whether native or encoded in EUC-CN) is more storage efficient: while UTF-8 uses three bytes per CJK ideograph, GB/T 2312 only uses two. However, GB/T 2312 does not cover as many ideographs as Unicode does.

To map the &quot;qūwèi&quot; code points to EUC bytes, add 160 (codice_4) to both the row number (or qū, 区) and cell/column number (&quot;ten&quot; or wèi, 位). The result of addition to the row number of the code point will form the high byte, and the result of addition to the cell number of the code point will form the low byte.

For example, to encode the character &quot;外&quot; at &quot;qūwèi&quot; cell 45-66, the high byte will use the row number 45: 45+160=205=codice_5, and the low byte will come from the cell number 66: 66+160=226=codice_6. So, the full encoding is codice_7.

=== ISO-2022-CN ===
ISO-2022-CN is another encoding form of GB/T 2312, which is also the encoding specified in the official documentation. This encoding references the ISO-2022 standard, which also uses two bytes to encode characters not found in ASCII. However, instead of using the extended region of ASCII, ISO-2022 uses the same byte range as ASCII: the value of the first byte is from codice_8 (33–119), while the value of the second byte is from codice_9 (33–126). As the byte range overlaps ASCII significantly, special characters are required to indicate whether a character is in the ASCII range or is part of the two-byte sequence of extended region, namely the Shift Out and Shift In functions. This poses a risk for misencoding as improper handling of text can result in missing information.

To map the &quot;qūwèi&quot; code points to ISO-2022 bytes, add 32 (codice_10) to both the row number (or qū, 区) and cell/column number (or wèi, 位). The result of addition to the row number of the code point will form the high byte, and the result of addition to the cell number of the code point will form the low byte similar to EUC encoding.

For example, to encode the character &quot;外&quot; at &quot;qūwèi&quot; cell 45-66, the high byte will use the row number 45: 45+32=77=codice_11, and the low byte will come from the cell number 66: 66+32=98=codice_12. So, the full encoding is codice_13.

=== HZ ===
HZ is another encoding of GB/T 2312 that is used mostly for Usenet postings; characters are represented with the same byte pairs as in ISO-2022-CN, but the byte sequences denoting the beginning and end of a range of GB 2312 text differ.

== Code charts ==
In the tables below, where a pair of hexadecimal numbers is given for a prefix byte or a coding byte, the smaller (with the eighth bit unset or unavailable) is used when encoded over GL (0x21-0x7E), as in ISO-2022-CN or HZ-GB-2312, and the larger (with the eighth bit set) is used in the more typical case of it being encoded over GR (0xA1-0xFE), as in EUC-CN, GBK or GB 18030. Qūwèi numbers are given in decimal.

When GB/T 2312 is encoded over GR, both bytes have the eighth bit set (i.e. are greater than 0x7F). GBK and GB 18030 also make use of two-byte codes in which only the first byte has the eighth bit set for extension purposes: such codes are outside of the GB/T 2312 plane, and are not tabulated here.

=== Lead byte ===
This chart details the overall layout of the main plane of the GB/T 2312 character set by lead byte. For lead bytes used for characters other than hanzi, links are provided to charts on this page listing the characters encoded under that lead byte. For lead bytes used for hanzi, links are provided to the appropriate section of Wiktionary&#x27;s hanzi index.

=== Non-Hanzi rows ===
The following charts list the non-hanzi characters available in GB/T 2312, in GB/T 12345, and in double-byte region 1 of GB 18030 (which roughly corresponds to the non-hanzi region of GB/T 2312). Notes are made where these differ, and where GB 6345.1 and ISO-IR-165 differ from these. Cross-references are made to articles on other CJK national character sets for comparison.

==== Two implementations of GB2312 ====
Unicode mappings of the interpunct () and em dash () in the subset of GBK and GB 18030 corresponding to GB/T 2312 ( and ) differ from those which are listed in GB2312.TXT ( and ), which is a data file which was previously provided by the Unicode Consortium, although it has been designated as obsolete since August 2011 and is no longer hosted as of September 2016.

As of 2015, Microsoft .Net Framework follows GB 18030 mappings when mapping those two characters in data labelled , whereas ICU, iconv-1.14, php-5.6, ActivePerl-5.20, Java 1.7 and Python 3.4 follow GB2312.TXT in response to the label. Ruby 2.2 is compatible with both implementations; it internally converts the conflictive characters to the GB 18030 subset. The W3C/WHATWG technical recommendation for use with HTML5 specifies a GBK encoding to be inferred for streams labelled codice_14, which in turn uses a GB18030 decoder.

Other differing mappings have been defined and used by individual vendors, including one from Apple.

==== Character set 0x21/0xA1 (row 1: punctuation and symbols) ====
This row contains punctuation, mathematical operators, and other symbols. The following table shows the GB 18030 mappings for these GB/T 2312 characters first, followed by any other documented mappings.

==== Character set 0x22/0xA2 (row 2: list markers) ====
This row contains various types of list marker. Lowercase forms of the Roman numerals were not included in the original GB/T 2312 nor in GB/T 12345, but are included in both Windows code page 936 and GB 18030. A euro sign was also added by GB 18030.

==== Character set 0x23/0xA3 (row 3: ISO 646-CN) ====
This row contains ISO 646-CN (GB/T 1988-80), a national counterpart to ASCII. Compare row 3 of KS X 1001, which does the same with South Korea&#x27;s ISO 646 version, and row 3 of JIS X 0208 and of KPS 9566, which include only the alphanumeric subset, but in the same layout. The following chart lists ISO 646-CN.

When used in an encoding allowing combination with ASCII such as EUC-CN (and its superset GB 18030), these characters are usually implemented as fullwidth characters, hence mappings to the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block are used as shown below. GB 6345.1 also handles this row as fullwidth, and adds the halfwidth forms (as above) as row 10. Apple mostly maps this row to fullwidth code points as below, but uses non-fullwidth mappings for the overline and yuan sign as above.

==== Character set 0x24/0xA4 (row 4: Hiragana) ====
This set contains Hiragana for writing the Japanese language.

Compare with row 4 of JIS X 0208, which this row matches, and with row 10 of KS X 1001 and of KPS 9566, which use the same layout, but in a different row.

==== Character set 0x25/0xA5 (row 5: Katakana) ====
This set contains Katakana for writing the Japanese language. However, the Japanese long vowel mark, which is used in katakana text and included in row 1 of JIS X 0208, is not included in GB/T 2312, although it is added in GBK and GB 18030 outside of the main GB/T 2312 plane, at 0xA960.

Compare with row 5 of JIS X 0208, which this row matches, and with row 11 of KS X 1001 and of KPS 9566, which use the same layout, but in a different row.

==== Character set 0x26/0xA6 (row 6: Greek and vertical extensions) ====
This row contains basic support for the modern Greek alphabet, without diacritics or the final sigma.

The highlighted characters are presentation forms of punctuation marks for vertical writing, and are not included in GB/T 2312 proper, but are included in this row by GB/T 12345, Windows code page 936, Mac OS Simplified Chinese, and GB 18030. They are seen as &quot;standard extensions to GB 2312&quot;. Conversely, ISO-IR-165 includes patterned semigraphic characters in this row (mostly without exact counterparts in Unicode), colliding with the code positions used for the vertical extensions.

Compare with row 6 of JIS X 0208, which this row matches when the vertical forms are not included, and with row 6 of KPS 9566, which includes the same Greek letters in the same layout, but adds Roman numerals rather than vertical forms. Contrast row 5 of KS X 1001, which offsets the Greek letters to include the Roman numerals first.

==== Character set 0x27/0xA7 (row 7: Cyrillic) ====
This set includes both cases of 33 letters from the Cyrillic script, sufficient to write the modern Russian alphabet and Bulgarian alphabet, although other forms of Cyrillic require additional letters.

Compare with row 7 of JIS X 0208, which this row matches, and with row 12 of KS X 1001 and row 5 of KPS 9566, which use the same layout but in different rows.

==== Character set 0x28/0xA8 (row 8: zhuyin and non-ASCII pinyin) ====
This row contains bopomofo and pinyin characters, excluding ASCII letters (which are in row 3). The highlighted characters are those which are not in the base GB 2312 set but are added by GB 6345.1, and also included in GB/T 12345, Windows code page 936, Mac OS Simplified Chinese and GB 18030. They are seen as &quot;standard extensions to GB 2312&quot;.

GB 6345.1 treats the pinyin in this row as fullwidth, and includes halfwidth counterparts as row 11; GB 18030 does not do this.

==== Character set 0x29/0xA9 (row 9: box drawing) ====

== Corrections ==
GB 5007.1-85 &quot;24×24 Bitmap Font Set of Chinese Characters for Information Exchange&quot; () is the earliest font template based on GB/T 2312 that features corrections and extensions including:
* changing the glyph shape of Latin alphabet &quot;g&quot;
* adding 6 Hanyu Pinyin characters: ɑ, ḿ, ń, ň, ǹ, ɡ
* changed &quot; to &quot;
* included 94 half-width glyphs in row 10 (half-width form of row 3, equivalent to GB 1988–80
* included half-width form of 32 Hanyu Pinyin characters from row 8 in row 11.

GB/T 2312 did not have corrections, but these corrections are included in font templates that are based on GB/T 2312 including GB/T 12345; its supersets GBK and GB 18030 also included these corrections. GB/T 2312 is also used in ISO-IR-165.

<doc id="546350" wikidata="Q1064173" url="?curid=546350" title="Stadsfries Dutch">
<text>Stadsfries or Town Frisian (Dutch: , ; , ) is a set of dialects spoken in certain cities in the province of Friesland in the northern Netherlands, namely Leeuwarden, Sneek, Bolsward, Franeker, Dokkum, Harlingen, Stavoren, and to some extent in Heerenveen. For linguistic reasons, the outlying and insular dialects of Midsland (Terschelling), Ameland, Het Bildt, and Kollum are also sometimes tied to Stadsfries.

The vocabulary of Stadsfries is derived primarily from Dutch. The dialects began in the late 15th century, when Frisia lost its political independence to the Netherlands. For many living in Frisia, learning Dutch became a necessity. The result was a mixture of Hollandic dialect vocabulary and West Frisian grammar and other language principles. Since this process began, the West Frisian language itself has evolved, such that Stadsfries is further away from modern Frisian than it is from Old Frisian. Norval Smith states that Stadsfries is a Frisian–Dutch mixed language.

The name of the dialect group, &quot;Stadsfries&quot;, is not an endonym but is instead a Dutch term for the language. &quot;Stad&quot; (German: Stadt) is a Germanic term for &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot;, seen in English place names such as &quot;Hempstead&quot;. In Stadsfries, the term for the dialect group is &quot;Stadsfrys&quot; or &quot;Stads&quot;, or each dialect is known simply by a name derived from the particular city name, such as &quot;Liwwarders&quot; for the dialect of Leeuwarden. In West Frisian, the dialects are known as &quot;stedsk&quot; (&quot;city-ish&quot;), which does not indicate the idea that Stadsfries is a form of Frisian.

== Vocabulary ==

The vocabulary of Stadsfries is mainly Dutch though the West Frisian language influence is notable. Furthermore, a set of word forms are used that are clearly West Frisian, not Dutch.
Examples:
The language also has typical West Frisian words that do not exist (in that sense) in Dutch, usually this concerns domestic words and words from the mainly West Frisian language agricultural sector.
Examples:
Other differences between Dutch and West Frisian can be traced back to the Dutch dialect of the 16th century.
Example:

Finally, several words have survived in the Stadsfries language due to Dutch influence that have since disappeared from the West Frisian language.
Examples:
== Grammar ==

Stadsfries phonology deviates from Dutch in the absence of the voiced sounds and at the beginning of words. Dutch words like this often have an equivalent Stadsfrisian translation that instead starts with the unvoiced sounds and . The Dutch sounds sequence does not exist in Stadsfries, but is often replaced with . Stadsfries has these properties in common with West Frisian, as well as several Dutch dialects.

The plurals match West Frisian &quot;(skip-skippen)&quot;, as do the diminutives &quot;(popke, autootsje, rinkje)&quot;, except those in Stavers &quot;(poppy, autootsy, rinkje)&quot;, where Hollands rules are followed.

The verbs are missing two West Frisian weak classes, but do use West Frisian rules for forming past participles: they never get the affix &quot;ge- (ik hew maakt; hest dou dat sien?)&quot;. Stadsfrisian kept the West Frisian pronouns &quot;do, jo and jimme&quot; (informal you, formal you, plural you), although &quot;do&quot; and &quot;jo&quot; are almost always written as &quot;dou&quot; and &quot;jou. &quot; These words can in fact be used as criteria for deciding whether a Hollandic-West Frisian mixed dialect can still be considered Stadsfries. The Dutch dialect called &quot;West Frisian&quot; spoken in the West Friesland region of North Holland for example does not have these words and is therefore considered Hollandic.

== Spelling ==

There is no standardized, officially recognized spelling for Stadsfries. The very few authors that write in it each use their own spelling conventions. The most commonly used spelling is that in the &quot;Woordenboek fan ut Liwwarders&quot; (Leeuwarden Dictionary). This spelling convention is closely related to, but more phonetic than West Frisian, and does not use the letter &quot;û&quot;.

== Speakers==

The use of Stadsfries is declining rapidly, especially in Leeuwarden. No more than a quarter of the city&#x27;s population (approximately 20,000 people) speaks the language, although that percentage is higher in smaller towns. In the first half of the twentieth century the town of Heerenveen had a local strand of Stadsfries known as Haagjes Fries, spoken especially around Oranjewoud, near the country home of the Frisian stadhouder.

Use of most dialects (as well as the West Frisian language) is declining, but because West Frisian is considered prestigious and even recognized as a Dutch national language, Stadsfries has become a sociolect of the lower classes, especially in the cities. The transition from dialect to sociolect happened primarily in the 20th century. Around 1900, the Stadsfries dialects were still considered regional strands of Dutch and given a much higher status than Frisian. With the rise of Standard Dutch in society&#x27;s upper classes, brought on particularly by education and mass media, Stadsfries stopped being considered a strand of Dutch. Since the lower classes had less exposure to Standard Dutch, they remained as some of the only speakers of Stadsfries.

<doc id="546356" wikidata="Q57329" url="?curid=546356" title="Danilo Türk">
<text>Danilo Türk (; born 19 February 1952) is a Slovenian diplomat, professor of international law, human rights expert, and political figure who served as President of Slovenia from 2007 to 2012. He was the first Slovene ambassador to the United Nations, from 1992 to 2000, and was the UN Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs from 2000 to 2005.

Türk is a visiting professor of international law at Columbia University in New York City, a professor emeritus at the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana, and non-resident senior fellow of Chongyang Institute for Financial studies at Renmin University of China in Beijing. He is the founder of the Danilo Türk Foundation, devoted mostly to the rehabilitation of child victims of armed conflict. Türk is also the chairman of the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace and the chairman of the board of the Global Fairness Initiative, a Washington, D.C.–based NGO dedicated to economic and social development in developing nations.

In 2016, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations.

==Early life==
Türk was born in a lower-middle-class family in Maribor, Slovenia (then part of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia). He attended Maribor Grammar School No. 2 (&quot;II. gimnazija Maribor&quot;). In 1971, he enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied law. After graduation (1975) he served as the secretary of the commission for minority and expatriate affairs at the Socialist Alliance of Working People (SZDL), an organisation sponsored by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In December 1979 he became the chairman of that commission and a member of the executive committee of the SZDL. At the same time he continued his studies. He obtained an MA with a thesis on minority rights from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School in 1978, and then became a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana. In 1982, he obtained his PhD with a dissertation on the principle of non-intervention in international law at the University in Ljubljana and received a full-time job as an assistant professor at the University in Ljubljana&#x27;s Faculty of Law. In 1983, he became the director of the University of Ljubljana&#x27;s Institute for International Law. In the following years, he worked on human and minority rights. In the mid-1980s, he collaborated with Amnesty International to report on human rights issues in Yugoslavia.

Between 1986 and 1992, he served in a personal capacity as a member the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and was the UN Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Together with Louis Joinet (France), he was also the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression. In 1987 he initiated the establishment of the Council for Human Rights in Slovenia and served until 1992 as the council’s vice-chairman. In 1990/91 he coauthored the human rights chapter in Slovenia&#x27;s constitution.

==Diplomatic and academic career==
From 1992 to 2000, Türk was the first Slovene Permanent Representative to the United Nations. During this time, he secured the election of Slovenia to the UN Security Council (1998–1999) and was president of the United Nations Security Council in August 1998 and November 1999.[1] Between 1996 and 1998, he was a member of the UN Human Rights Committee. From 2000 to 2005, he served as UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs under Secretary General Kofi Annan. In 2005 he returned to Slovenia and became a professor of international law; from May 2006 to December 2007 he served as the vice dean of student affairs at the University of Ljubljana&#x27;s Faculty of Law. Türk has published over 100 articles in various law journals and three books. He authored the first Slovene book on international law, titled &quot;Temelji mednarodnega prava&quot; (Foundations of International Law, 2007, revised 2015).

In 2019, Türk was elected president of the Club of Madrid.

==Presidency==

In June 2007, Türk ran in the Slovene presidential election. As an independent candidate, he was backed by a broad coalition of left-wing parties, composed of the opposition Zares party and Social Democrats, the Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia, and the extra-parliamentary Christian Socialist Party and Democratic Party. In the first round of the presidential elections, held on 21 October 2007, he placed second with 24.54% of the votes, which brought him into the runoff against the centre right candidate Lojze Peterle (who received 28.50% of the popular vote). He won the runoff on 11 November 2007 with 68.2% of the votes,[2] becoming the third president of Slovenia on 23 December 2007. Türk ran for reelection in 2012, but lost the election to Borut Pahor in a second round of voting, held on 2 December 2012.[5] He received roughly one-third of the votes.

==UN Secretary-General candidature==
In December 2013, Türk announced that he was planning to run for UN Secretary-General. He was soon supported by Prime Minister Alenka Bratušek and Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Erjavec. In January 2014 the Slovene government endorsed Türk as its candidate for UN Secretary-General. He was later also supported by Prime Minister Miro Cerar and President Borut Pahor, as well as by Speaker of the National Assembly of Slovenia Milan Brglez (also a professor at the University of Ljubljana). In accordance with the UN procedure, the government of Slovenia nominated Danilo Türk as candidate for UN Secretary-General on 8 February 2016.

Türk is an experienced member of the United Nations community. He served as the first Permanent Representative of the Republic of Slovenia to the UN and remained in New York as ambassador for eight years, from 1992 until 2000. As Slovenian representative he also presided over the United Nations Security Council twice. His work was recognised by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who chose Türk as one of his close advisors and appointed him Assistant Secretary-General in 2000. He served in this position until 2005, when he returned to Slovenia to teach international law at the University of Ljubljana.

Türk has long been recognised as an expert and global advocate for human rights and his work has been connected with human rights and the fight for equality for more than 40 years.

One element of human rights that Turk has been questioned about is the UN&#x27;s role in the Haiti cholera outbreak that has been widely discussed and criticized. There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haiti&#x27;s water stream. In an interview with the New York Times, Türk was asked if cholera victims should receive compensation. He responded by saying he hopes the UN would &quot;provide the victims with a fair process and an effective remedy.&quot; St. Vincent followed this up during the UN informal dialogues by asking Mr. Türk how he would place the pursuit of an effective remedy on his list of priorities. Türk&#x27;s response was that though the UN enjoys immunity from prosecution, &quot;there are other ways of establishing fair process and effectiveness&quot;. He also stated &quot;current discussions that I know exist within the Secretariat and between the Secretariat and member states will produce such effectiveness and fairness.&quot; Following-up at the media stakeout, Inner City Press questioned Türk about his statement that there may be some process going on behind the scenes to pay compensation. Türk responded by saying that there have been informal conversations about the Haitian situation, and though he does not have full knowledge, he can say that &quot;this story is not closed.&quot; He admits that he values the importance of legal regulation including UN immunity, but he also believes in remedies and fair processes.

37 human rights organizations recently signed onto a UN Secretary General accountability pledge. This pledge asks the candidates to take action on two human rights violations that have tarnished the United Nations&#x27; image: failing to provide remedies for victims of cholera in Haiti, and sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers. Türk issued a statement responding to Aids Free World and the Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti, expressing his support for the organizations&#x27; efforts. While he acknowledges that he has &quot;clearly expressed [his] commitment to fairness towards the victims of cholera in Haiti and for substantial, credible and speedy investigations of the cases of sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers&quot;, he cannot undertake formal pledges. Nevertheless, he reaffirms his commitment to better UN accountability and says &quot;it is abundantly clear where my heart is.&quot;

==Later career==
In 2022, Türk was appointed by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres to the High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, co-chaired by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Stefan Löfven.

==Personal life==
Türk has been married to Barbara Miklič since 1976. They have one daughter and one granddaughter. He is the brother of the manager Vitoslav Türk, member of the Slovenian Democratic Party. Türk speaks Slovene, English, French, Croatian, and Serbian.

===Health===
In March 2011, Türk successfully underwent robot-assisted prostate cancer surgery at the Urology Institute in Innsbruck, Austria.

<doc id="546365" wikidata="Q230932" url="?curid=546365" title="Mingachevir">
<text>Mingachevir ( ) is the fourth largest city in Azerbaijan with a population of about 106,000. It is often called the &quot;city of lights&quot; because of its hydroelectric power station on the Kura River, which divides the city down the middle.

The current city was founded in 1948, partly by German prisoners of war captured during World War II. Mingechevir is also home to Mingachevir Polytechnic Institute. The city forms an administrative division of Azerbaijan. The district is located 323 km from the capital Baku and 17 km from the Baku-Tbilisi railway. Geographically, the region is located in the center of the republic on both sides of the Kura River.

==History==

The archaeological history of this area extends from the eneolith era (3000 BC) to the AD 17th century. In 1871, Adolf Berge, chairman of the Caucasus archaeological committee, gave information about the archaeological monuments of Mingachevir at the second congress of archaeologists in St Petersburg, wrongfully presenting Mingachevir as an ancient settlement.
After this, Mingachevir remained out of archaeologists&#x27; attention until the mid-1930s when archaeological researches resumed as part of the construction of the hydroelectric power station. In 1935, researches under the leadership of Prof. Pakhomov revealed two ancient settlements and cemeteries, which were composed of various types of graves. Unfortunately, World War II prevented the research from being completed.

The construction of the hydroelectric power station started immediately after the war. This marked the start of systematic and planned research of Mingachevir as an ancient settlement. Archaeological excavations were carried out from April 1946 to August 1953 by a group of archaeologists headed by S. M. Qaziyev in connection with the construction of the Mingachevir hydroelectric power station under a decision by the Supreme Board of the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences. 
Historical sources indicate that a fierce battle took place between the powerful army of Roman commander Pompey and the army of Albanian governor Oris just on the territory of the current dam on the bank of the Kura river in the 1st century BC.

Renowned Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi, who lived in the 17th century AD, wrote about Mingachevir and described it as a large settlement on the right bank of the River Kur near the Bozdag Mountain. According to him, several mosques, workshops manufacturing fibre silk and silk cloth, bathhouses, etc., were operating in this settlement. The road passing from there used to be called the &quot;road of the messenger&quot;. The &quot;road of the messenger&quot; connected camelcase and trade roads to Middle East countries and Azerbaijani towns like Saki, Qabala, Samaxi, Barda, Beylaqan and others.

A great number of people came to Mingachevir from all districts in Azerbaijan in connection with the construction of the Mingachevir hydroelectric power station, and a total of 20,000 people took part in the construction of this power station. About 10,000 German POWs were among those who contributed to the construction of the power station by the end of the 1940s. The most experienced specialists of the country were involved in the construction of this building site as the biggest hydroelectric power station of the then Soviet Union.

The area of the town is 139.53 km2. Mingachevir is situated 55 meters above sea level on the foothill of the southeast of the Bozdag Mountain chain and on the edge of the Mingachevir reservoir in the Kur-Araz lowland in central Azerbaijan. The town was built in a mild and warm zone and has warm and dry summers and mild winters. The average annual temperature is 14 - 15 °C, highest temperature 42 °C (July–August) and the lowest temperature (January–February) -10 °C. The average annual rainfall is 250–300 mm.

The town lies on both banks of the Kura river - a 1515 km-long river, which is the biggest and longest one in the South Caucasus. Mingachevir is situated 280–300 km west of the capital of the republic, Baku.

Mingachevir has been developing rapidly over the last 54 years since it has been established. It is currently considered to be the fourth most developed city of the country both for its economic potential and the number of inhabitants, it is one of the most important cities of the republic in terms of energy, industry, science, education and culture.
The number of able-bodied people in Mingachevir is 53,000, while the number of people actually involved in labour is 16,000. The number of people engaged in small-sized businesses stands at 4,000.

The reservoir is located 3 km north-west of the district. The length of the reservoir is 70 km, width from 3 to 18 km, deepest point about 75 meters and total area 605 km2.

Apart from the River Kur, the reservoir feeds two channels of the 172 km-long Upper Qarabag Channel and the 123 km-long Upper Sirvan Channel. These channels are used to irrigate 10,000 square kilometres of area in the steppes of Mil, Mugan and Sirvan.

<text>The North Jutlandic Island (), Vendsyssel-Thy, or Jutland north of the Limfjord (&quot;Jylland nord for Limfjorden&quot;) is the northernmost part of Denmark and of Jutland. It is more common to refer to the three traditional districts of Vendsyssel, Hanherred, and Thy. The area has been intermittently a tied island and, during modern times, was not surrounded by water until a storm in February 1825, which severed the region from the remainder of Jutland and created a water connection between the North Sea and the western end of the Limfjord. Vendsyssel-Thy retains its traditional status as a part of Jutland even though it is now an island.

By area, it is the second-largest island of Denmark after Zealand (excluding Greenland), with a population of 294,424 on 1 January 2020. 309,834 people lived on the island in 1981.

Danes rarely refer to the area as a whole, but more often to the three constituent districts or to North Jutland (which also includes an area south of the Limfjord). The adjectives &quot;nordenfjords&quot; and &quot;søndenfjords&quot; are also commonly used, meaning &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; of the fjord, respectively. The names can all be considered ad hoc creations, as a traditional name for the island is lacking.

The island has seven fixed transport links to the mainland (four road bridges, one road tunnel, and two rail bridges). There are also two car ferry connections.

==History==
The narrow sand tombolo of Agger Tange connected North Jutland Island to the Jutland Peninsula between c. 1200 and 1825. The area became an island again due to a storm on 3 February 1825, when the North Sea broke through the Agger Tange in its far southwest, separating the area from mainland Jutland and creating the Agger Channel. The current separator is the Thyborøn Channel, which was created slightly further south by a flood in 1862. The original Agger Channel filled up with sand in 1877.

The syssel was a medieval sub-division which is regarded as the oldest type of administrative unit in Denmark, having existed since before the Middle Ages. The land of the North Jutlandic Island was divided into two of these: Thysyssel (including Hanherred) and Vendsyssel.

==Geography==

The North Jutlandic Island consists of these three traditional regions:

*Vendsyssel, the largest part to the east and north,
*Thy, the lesser part to the west,
*Hanherrederne, or Hanherred, is the central isthmus connecting Vendsyssel and Thy.

Since 1 January 2007, when the Danish municipal reform became effective, these areas, along with Himmerland and the islands of Mors and Læsø have constituted the North Jutland Region, the smallest of Denmark&#x27;s five regions by population. Ecclesiastically, the North Jutland Islands are the main part of the Diocese of Aalborg.

In traditional terms, the westernmost part of the island, Thy, is considered part of both Northern and Western Jutland simultaneously. The term North West Jutland refers to Thy, the island Mors, and the parts of mainland Jutland bordering the western Limfjord, such as the peninsula of Salling and around the towns of Struer and Lemvig.

<text>Theodore Rose Cogswell (March 10, 1918 – February 3, 1987) was an American science fiction author.

== Profile ==
During the Spanish Civil War, Cogswell served as an ambulance driver for the Republicans as part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He later served in the U.S. Army Air Corp during WWII, where he flew cargo planes over the Burma Road hump, and was discharged with the rank of Captain.

His earliest work to be published in a genre magazine, the novella, &quot;The Spectre General&quot; in &quot;Astounding&quot; (June 1952), was a humorous story concerning the long-forgotten maintenance brigade of the Imperial Space Marines of a Galactic empire. It was selected as one of the genre&#x27;s best novellas by members of the Science Fiction Writers of America and reprinted in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame&quot;. 

Cogswell authored nearly 40 science fiction stories, most of them humorous, and co-authored &quot;Spock, Messiah!&quot;, one of the earliest novels tied in to the &quot;&quot; franchise. He was also the editor of the long-running &quot;fanzine for pros&quot;, &quot;Proceedings of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies&quot;.

<doc id="546392" wikidata="Q72176" url="?curid=546392" title="Lakewood Church">
<text>Lakewood Church is a non-denominational evangelical Christian megachurch located in Houston, Texas. It is among the largest congregations in the United States, averaging about 45,000 attendees per week. The 16,800-seat Lakewood Church building, home to four English-language services and two Spanish-language services per week, is located at the former Compaq Center. Joel Osteen is the senior pastor of Lakewood Church with his wife, Victoria, who serves as co-pastor.

It has 368 full-time and part-time staff.

==History==

Lakewood Church, originally called Lakewood Baptist Church, was founded by John Osteen and his second wife, Dolores (Dodie) on Mother&#x27;s Day, May 10, 1959, in a tent. The church then moved to an abandoned feed store in northeast Houston. John was a Southern Baptist minister, but after experiencing baptism in the Holy Spirit, he founded Lakewood as a church for charismatic Baptists. The church soon dropped &quot;Baptist&quot; from its name and became nondenominational. In 1961, John Osteen left the church and was called to missions. Marvin Crow became the pastor in his absence until John returned in 1969. In 1972, Lakewood broke ground for a new building that seated seven hundred people. By 1979, attendance was over five thousand, and the church was becoming prominent among Pentecostals and charismatics. John and Dodie created and hosted Lakewood&#x27;s weekly television program, which could be seen in one hundred countries worldwide. On February 15, 1987, a groundbreaking was held for a new eight-thousand–seat sanctuary, which was completed in April 1988.

Following John Osteen&#x27;s death on January 23, 1999, his youngest son, Joel Osteen, became the pastor that October.

In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison caused flooding in the Houston area. Lakewood Church was opened as a shelter to approximately five thousand displaced persons.

Under Joel Osteen, Lakewood&#x27;s congregation increased almost fivefold. Attendance increased to thirty thousand  weekly, prompting a move from its location at 7317 East Houston Road to a larger facility. In late 2003, the church signed a long-term lease with the city of Houston to acquire the Compaq Center, a 29-year-old former sports arena.

Lakewood Church relocated to the Compaq Center on July 16, 2005. It is a 16,800-seat facility in southwest downtown Houston along U.S. Highway 59, that has twice the capacity of its former sanctuary. The church was required to pay $11.8 million in rent in advance for the first thirty years of the lease. Lakewood renovated the new campus at an estimated cost of $100 million in loans, which was paid off in 2024.

The church received $15 million after selling the former building to New Light Christian Center Church. On March 31, 2010, the Houston City Council voted 13–2 to sell the property to Lakewood for $7.5 million.

In November 2018, CBS News listed Lakewood Church as the largest megachurch in the United States with about 43,500 weekly visitors.

On December 3, 2021, national news services reported that a plumber found cash and checks within a wall behind a toilet that was being repaired. They may have been related to a 2014 incident in which $600,000 in cash and checks disappeared from a safe.

=== Shooting ===

On February 11, 2024, a woman with a history of mental health issues, Genesse Ivonne Moreno, accompanied by her 7-year-old son, entered the church between services and began firing an AR-15. Two off-duty police officers working security returned fire and killed her. Her boy was critically injured with a gunshot to the head during the exchange of gunfire. Another man who was present was wounded in the hip, treated at a local hospital and released.

==Beliefs==
Lakewood Church believes that the entire Bible is inspired by God, and the church bases its teachings on this belief. The church also believes in the Trinity, and recognizes the death of Christ on the cross and resurrection.

The church practices the following, believing them to be commanded in the Bible:
* The pursuit of Salvation: Each service offers an Altar call at the end in order for people to accept Christ as Lord and Savior.
* Water baptism: The church believes the Bible asks for this as a symbol and a testimony to faith in Jesus Christ – in &quot;his cleansing power through his shedding of blood on the cross for us.&quot; Baptism is practiced every Saturday night in the church&#x27;s Chapel.
* Communion: The church believes the Bible asks for this act of remembering the death of Jesus on the cross. It is offered every week in the New Beginnings room (just down from the bookstore).
* The seeking of a growing relationship with Jesus Christ: Lakewood believes that every believer should be in a growing relationship with Jesus by obeying the rules laid out in the Bible, yielding to the Holy Spirit and by being conformed to the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Lakewood Church is known for its Word of Faith teaching rooted in the Bible. It is also known, before every sermon, for a creed (originally led by John and continued by Joel) which the congregation repeats in unison.

==Church organization==
Lakewood offers different types of ministries, fellowships, and services depending on the age, marital status, and need of its members.

===Services===
* Kidslife: Children
* Champions Club for Special Needs
* Lakewood Next Gen: Middle School, High School, and Young Adults
* Main Service: all adults

During weekend services, Joel Osteen, Victoria Osteen, or Danilo Montero preach. On Wednesday nights, associate pastors Paul Osteen, Lisa Osteen Comes, Nick Nilson, and Craig Johnson, or guest speakers preach.

===Education===
Various classes are offered through the Compass Classes ministry, meeting before and after weekend services.

===Television===
The church&#x27;s weekly services are broadcast on Trinity Broadcasting Network and Daystar Television Network, as well as local channels in most major U.S. markets. Lakewood also appears on secular networks, such as Fox Network, Freeform, and USA Network. In 2007, Lakewood reported spending nearly $30 million every year on its television ministry. Osteen&#x27;s sermons are also televised in more than 100 countries, with an estimated 7 million viewers each week. Lakewood also hosts a Night of Hope every month. This is when the church hosts a Christian service event in one of the arenas or stadiums all across America.

===Hispanic ministry===
In 2002, Lakewood began a Hispanic ministry, Iglesia Lakewood, founded by Hispanic Pastor Marcos Witt and his wife, Miriam Witt. In September 2012, Danilo and Gloriana Montero assumed the role of associate pastors for the Hispanic ministry. Lakewood has two services each week in Spanish and translates all English services into Spanish. The weekly attendance at the Spanish services is approximately 6,000 people.

===Charitable work===
Since 2016, Lakewood Church organizes an annual Mobilizing Medical Missions Conference to equip doctors for on-field medical missions. The church has been active during natural disasters by organizing food distribution programs and blood donation drives during COVID 19, providing shelter services during Hurricane Ida and 2021 Texas Freeze, and serving as a distribution center for essential supplies during Hurricane Harvey.

==Criticism==
===Prosperity gospel===
Osteen&#x27;s sermons and writings are noted for promoting prosperity theology, a belief that material gain is a reward for pious Christians. When asked if he is a prosperity teacher, Osteen responded that if prosperity means God wants people to be blessed and healthy and have good relationships, then he considers himself a prosperity teacher, but if it is about money, he does not. He has specifically stated that he never preaches about money because of the reputation of televangelists. In an interview with &quot;The Christian Post&quot; on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as being part of the prosperity gospel. &quot;I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it&#x27;s fair, but it&#x27;s just what it is. I think prosperity, and I&#x27;ve said it 1,000 times, it&#x27;s being healthy, it&#x27;s having great children, it&#x27;s having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of. But when I hear the term prosperity gospel, I think people are sometimes saying, &#x27;Well, he&#x27;s just asking for money&#x27;.&quot; On October 14, 2007, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; ran a twelve-minute segment on Osteen, titled &quot;Joel Osteen Answers his Critics&quot;, during which Reformed theologian Michael Horton told CBS News correspondent Byron Pitts that Osteen&#x27;s message is heresy. Horton stated that the problem with Osteen&#x27;s message is that it makes religion about us instead of about God. According to the Houston Chronicle Lakewood church’s income was $89m in the year ending March 2017. More than 90 percent of that was raised from church followers and barely 1 percent of its budget went to charitable causes.

===Slow response to Hurricane Harvey===
During the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Osteen received significant criticism in response to not making Lakewood Church, a , 16,000 seat, former basketball arena, available as an emergency shelter for those displaced by the storm. On August 27, posts from the church and a Lakewood Church associate pastor&#x27;s social media accounts stated that the church was &quot;inaccessible due to severe flooding,&quot; and associate pastor John Gray posting further, &quot;If WE could get there WE WOULD OPEN THE DOORS.&quot; However the area was not under flood warning and photos and videos posted on social media appeared to counter the church&#x27;s claim. In a subsequent interview, Osteen denied the claim that the church was closed during the flood, saying &quot;the church has been open from the beginning,&quot; and, &quot;We&#x27;ve always been open … How this notion got started, that we&#x27;re not a shelter and we&#x27;re not taking people in is a false narrative.&quot; He also said that &quot;On the evening of August 28, it was announced by Lakewood that it would open at noon the next day as an available shelter, opening to storm victims and emergency personnel on August 29&quot;.

On August 15, 2018, the City of Houston and Mayor Sylvester Turner proclaimed a &quot;Lakewood Church Day&quot; in honor of Lakewood&#x27;s assistance in reconstruction efforts across the Houston area. It stated Lakewood has provided &quot;assistance to more than 1,150 Houston-area families whose homes were damaged or destroyed by floodwaters&quot; and bought &quot;1.1 million dollars in building materials, furniture, appliances, and paid labor, as well as through the contribution of more than 2,500 volunteers&quot;. The unconfirmed but oft mentioned reason for Lakewood not initially opening doors to hurricane survivors was the former basketball arena’s carpet had been recently replaced.

<text>Werner Wilhelm Jaeger (30 July 1888 – 19 October 1961) was a German-American classicist.

==Life==
Werner Wilhelm Jaeger was born in Lobberich, Rhenish Prussia in the German Empire. He attended school in Lobberich and at the Gymnasium Thomaeum in Kempen. Jaeger studied at the University of Marburg and University of Berlin. He received a Ph.D. from the latter in 1911 for a dissertation on the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; of Aristotle. His habilitation was on Nemesios of Emesa in 1914. At only 26 years old, Jaeger was called to the professorial chair in Greek at the University of Basel in Switzerland once held by Friedrich Nietzsche. One year later, he moved to a similar position at Kiel, and in 1921 he returned to Berlin, succeeding to Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. Jaeger remained in Berlin until 1936.

That year, he emigrated to the United States because he was unhappy with the rise of Nazism. Jaeger expressed his veiled disapproval in 1937 with &quot;Humanistische Reden und Vorträge&quot; (&quot;Humanist Speeches and Lectures&quot;), and his book &quot;Demosthenes&quot; (1938) based on his Sather lecture from 1934. Jaeger&#x27;s messages were fully understood in German university circles, with Nazi academics sharply attacking him.

In 1944, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In the United States, Jaeger worked as a full professor at the University of Chicago from 1936 to 1939. He then moved to Harvard University to continue his edition of the Church father Gregory of Nyssa on which he had started before World War I. Jaeger would remain in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until his death.

The American classicist Robert Renehan and Canadian philosophers James Doull and Robert Crouse were among his students at Harvard.

==Scholarly work==
===Interpretation of Plato and Aristotle===
Jaeger&#x27;s position concerning the history of the interpretation of Plato and Aristotle has been summarized by Harold Cherniss of Johns Hopkins University. In general, the history of the interpretation of Plato and Aristotle has largely followed the outline of those who subscribe to the position that (a) Aristotle was sympathetic to the reception of Plato&#x27;s early dialogues and writings, that (b) Aristotle was sympathetic to the reception of Plato&#x27;s later dialogues and writings, and (c) various combinations and variations of these two positions. Cherniss&#x27; reading of Jaeger states, &quot;Werner Jaeger, in whose eyes Plato&#x27;s philosophy was the &#x27;matter&#x27; out of which the newer and higher form of Aristotle&#x27;s thought proceeded by a gradual but steady and undeviating development (&quot;Aristoteles&quot;, p. 11), pronounced the &#x27;old controversy,&#x27; [which was] whether or not Aristotle understood Plato, to be &#x27;absolut verständnislos.&#x27; (absolutely uncomprehending [of Aristotle]). Yet this did not prevent Dieter Leisegang from reasserting that Aristotle&#x27;s own pattern of thinking was incompatible with a proper understanding of Plato.&quot;

<doc id="546395" wikidata="Q1234735" url="?curid=546395" title="Tidworth">
<text>Tidworth is a garrison town and civil parish in south-east Wiltshire, England, on the eastern edge of Salisbury Plain. Lying on both sides of the A338 about north of the A303 primary route, the town is approximately west of Andover, south of Marlborough, and north by north-east of Salisbury. The population of the parish at the 2011 census was approximately 10,600.

Originally two villages – North Tidworth and South Tidworth – the modern town is dominated by Tidworth Camp, a large British Army site. Swinton Barracks, another Army site, is in the west of the parish.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area is in the form of several sites with bowl barrows, including a group of seven; and an Iron Age hillfort at Sidbury Hill in the north of the parish.

Domesday Book of 1086 recorded four landowners and 18 households at what is now North Tidworth, in the Amesbury hundred of Wiltshire; and three landowners with 20 households and one church at South Tidworth, in the Broughton hundred of Hampshire. Placenames were written as &quot;Todeworde&quot;, &quot;Tedorde&quot; or &quot;Todeorde&quot;.

The two villages developed in the valley of the small River Bourne, which flows south to join the Hampshire Avon near Salisbury; later the Oxford-Salisbury road also followed the valley.

On John Speed&#x27;s maps of 1611 the villages are North Tudworth, belonging to Amesbury hundred in &quot;Wilshire&quot;, and South Tudworth to Andover hundred in &quot;Hamshire&quot;. Before 1650 there was a substantial country house with parkland at South Tidworth; the present Tedworth House is a rebuilding of 1828–1830.

In 1897 the War Office bought the house and grounds, together with land to the north which gave access to Salisbury Plain for Army training. Extensive barracks were built in the early 20th century, largely in South Tidworth but spreading across the boundary to the north. From 1902 to 1963 there was a railway station at North Tidworth, connected to the main line by a branch from Ludgershall.

North and South were separate ecclesiastical parishes, and therefore became civil parishes in the 19th century. An Ordnance Survey map of 1958 labels the parishes as North Tidworth and South Tedworth. When the boundary between Wiltshire and Hampshire was redrawn in 1992, the entire town became part of Wiltshire, though remaining part of the Hampshire postal county. The two parts remained as separate civil parishes until 1 April 2004.

In the 21st century the population of the town increased as the barracks now known as Tidworth Camp expanded, in particular following the return of units from Germany in 2019 and 2020 under the Army Basing Plan.

==Religious sites==

=== Parish church ===

Holy Trinity, North Tidworth is the Church of England parish church. There may have been a church here in the 12th century but the earliest record is of 1291. The present building, in flint and stone with repairs in red brick, is from the late 14th and 15th centuries. Restoration designed by J. L. Pearson in 1882 included replacement of the roofs and rebuilding of the porch. The church was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1988.

The font is from the 12th century. Three of the six bells were cast in 1619 by John Wallis, and another is from 1700. There are two 17th-century chest tombs in the churchyard. Parish registers from 1700 are held by the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre, Chippenham.

The Hampshire benefices of South Tidworth and Shipton Bellinger were united in 1926, with the incumbent to live at Tidworth, although the parishes remained separate. In 1972 Shipton Bellinger was made a separate benefice, the parishes of North and South Tidworth were united, and the Victorian church at South Tidworth was declared redundant. The benefice was united with the parish of Ludgershall and Faberstown in 1986.

=== Others ===
There was a church dedicated to St Mary at South Tidworth from the 13th or 14th centuries, but by 1784 it was in poor condition and Thomas Assheton Smith the elder, owner of Tedworth House, was given permission to demolish it. Masonry from the church, including a 14th-century window and some monuments, was used to build a small chapel which remains in use as a mortuary chapel for the surrounding cemetery.
A replacement St Mary&#x27;s Church was built closer to Tedworth House in 1878 to designs of John Johnson at the expense of Sir John Kelk, who had bought the estate in 1877. It is Grade I listed and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

St Michael&#x27;s Garrison Church (Church of England) and St Patrick&#x27;s Garrison Church (Roman Catholic), both built in 1912, are the military churches for the garrison.

== Governance ==
The parish elects a town council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most local government functions. Tidworth elects two members of Wiltshire Council: one for Tidworth North &amp; West which covers most of the town, including Tidworth Camp, and one for Tidworth East &amp; Ludgershall South which takes in a small eastern part of the town as well as Perham Down and the southern half of Ludgershall.

For Westminster elections, the parish falls in the East Wiltshire constituency, which has been represented since 2024 by Danny Kruger for the Conservatives.

== Amenities ==
Tidworth has a small commercial area containing two supermarkets (a Lidl and a large Tesco), two veterinary surgeries, a pharmacy, and other shops and services. A dental surgery serves Tidworth and the surrounding area, covering approximately 5,000 people. In 2003 a new medical centre was completed, the cost being split between the Ministry of Defence and the NHS, as it serves the armed forces and their dependants within the surrounding area.

Castledown FM, a community radio station, broadcasts to Tidworth and Ludgershall from studios in the grounds of Wellington Academy.

Tidworth has one of the lowest crime rates per thousand in Wiltshire, and between 1990 and 2004 only one major crime took place. In 2014, it was rated by the Royal Mail as the most attractive postcode area of England to live in.

Tidworth Garrison Golf Club was constructed in 1904 initially for use by army officers. It was established in 1908 and gradually made available to all ranks and civilians. In 2000 it became a limited company.

Tidworth Polo Club also known as Tedworth Park Polo Club is south of Tedworth House. The ground is central to the British Army Polo Association and is affiliated to the UK Armed Forces Polo Association.

South of Tidworth is a downhill mountain biking venue, first built in secret by the local mountain biking community in 2006. After the landowner discovered the site and forced the issue, Tidworth Freeride was taken over by B1KE, who now operate the site commercially, catering to a wide range of abilities.

==Education==
The Wellington Academy, a secondary school which was partly sponsored by Wellington College, opened in September 2009, replacing Castledown School. The academy has a sixth form college, an all-weather sports pitch, and dedicated Combined Cadet Force facilities. The parent unit of the CCF is 26 Royal Engineers, housed nearby at Swinton Barracks.

The community is served by three primary schools and an infant school.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Hannington and the local relay transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire on 103.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Salisbury on 102 FM and British Forces Broadcasting Service that provides radio programmes for His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces in nearby Salisbury Plain on 106.8 FM. 

The local newspapers that cover the town is the Salisbury Journal and Andover Advertiser. 

==Notable residents==
Duggie Fields, artist, was born in Tidworth, as was musician James Blunt in 1974.

Owners of the South Tidworth estate and Tedworth House include John Smith (1656–1723), Speaker of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer; Thomas Assheton Smith (1752–1828), owner of Dinorwic quarry and MP; and his son Thomas (1776–1858), cricketer, foxhunter, yacht designer and MP, who built the present house.

<text>The &quot;Porpoise&quot; class was an eight-boat class of diesel-electric submarines operated by the Royal Navy. This class was originally designated patrol submarines, then attack. They were the first conventional British submarines to be built after the end of World War II. Their design was, in many ways, influenced by the German World War II-era Type XXI U-boats.

==Design==
The &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarines were larger but shorter than their T-class predecessors and used a much improved steel known as UXW. This, and improved design and construction techniques allowed much deeper diving. It was found in tests that the unusually long engine room was liable to collapse, so there were extra large frames in this section, which proved to be something of an operational inconvenience.

Designed with a top speed of , the boats were capable of , or once fitted with silenced propellers. However, quieter running was felt to be a positive trade-off for the reduced speed. The &quot;Porpoise&quot; class were exceptionally quiet underwater, more so than their NATO counterparts and far more so than the Soviet s. This was in part due to careful attention to detail in the mounting of machinery, and advances made in propeller design to prevent cavitation. Initially, the silenced propellers actually set up a distinctive resonant &quot;singing&quot;. However, grooves were cut into the propellers and injected with a damping filler which cured the problem; &quot;Rorqual&quot; was later able to surface undetected off the Statue of Liberty. The silent running abilities made their sonar equipment particularly effective.

Each submarine&#x27;s armament consisted of eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes; six in the bow, and two in the stern. Initially, up to 30 Mark 8 or Mark 23 torpedoes were carried, although these were replaced in the 1970s by the Mark 24 Tigerfish torpedo. The class were also the first since the World War I-era R class to not carry a deck gun.

The &quot;Porpoise&quot;s were far more capable than previous submarine classes in operating for prolonged periods, thanks to much improved air recirculation and cleaning systems. The class also performed excellently in clandestine operations, such as surveillance and inserting special forces.

The first &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class boats were launched in 1958 during the ever-increasing threat of the Soviet Union&#x27;s submarine fleet. The &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class boats were all decommissioned by the 1980s. The submarines, which were almost identical to the &quot;Porpoise&quot;s, and the first of which was commissioned in 1961, survived their predecessor only a little longer, all being decommissioned in the early 1990s.

<text>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single-spanning receptors usually expressed on sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have reached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13. Humans lack genes for TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13 and mice lack a functional gene for TLR10. The receptors TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR10 are located on the cell membrane, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located in intracellular vesicles (because they are sensors of nucleic acids).

TLRs received their name from their similarity to the protein coded by the toll gene.

== Function ==
The ability of the immune system to recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens is, in part, due to the presence of immune receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on the membranes of leukocytes including dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, cells of the adaptive immunity T cells, and B cells, and non-immune cells (epithelial and endothelial cells, and fibroblasts).

The binding of ligands — either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection — to the TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity.

Upon activation, TLRs recruit adaptor proteins (proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the cytosol of the immune cell to propagate the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway. These recruited proteins are then responsible for the subsequent activation of other downstream proteins, including protein kinases (IKKi, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TBK1) that further amplify the signal and ultimately lead to the upregulation or suppression of genes that orchestrate inflammatory responses and other transcriptional events. Some of these events lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity. If the ligand is a bacterial factor, the pathogen might be phagocytosed and digested, and its antigens presented to CD4+ T cells.
In the case of a viral factor, the infected cell may shut off its protein synthesis and may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Immune cells that have detected a virus may also release anti-viral factors such as interferons.

Toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an important link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells. Flagellin, a TLR5 ligand, induces cytokine secretion on interacting with TLR5 on human T cells.

== Superfamily ==
TLRs are a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules, collectively referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In addition to the recognition of exogenous PAMPs, TLRs can also bind to endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) or plasma membrane constituents. TLRs together with the Interleukin-1 receptors form a receptor superfamily, known as the &quot;interleukin-1 receptor / toll-like receptor superfamily&quot;; all members of this family have in common a so-called TIR (toll-IL-1 receptor) domain.

Three subgroups of TIR domains exist. Proteins with subgroup 1 TIR domains are receptors for interleukins that are produced by macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells and all have extracellular Immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. Proteins with subgroup 2 TIR domains are classical TLRs, and bind directly or indirectly to molecules of microbial origin. A third subgroup of proteins containing TIR domains consists of adaptor proteins that are exclusively cytosolic and mediate signaling from proteins of subgroups 1 and 2.

== Extended family ==

TLRs are present in vertebrates as well as invertebrates. Molecular building blocks of the TLRs are represented in bacteria and in plants, and plant pattern recognition receptors are well known to be required for host defence against infection. The TLRs thus appear to be one of the most ancient, conserved components of the immune system.

In recent years TLRs were identified also in the mammalian nervous system. Members of the TLR family were detected on glia, neurons and on neural progenitor cells in which they regulate cell-fate decision.

It has been estimated that most mammalian species have between ten and fifteen types of toll-like receptors. Thirteen TLRs (named simply TLR1 to TLR13) have been identified in humans and mice together, and equivalent forms of many of these have been found in other mammalian species. However, equivalents of certain TLR found in humans are not present in all mammals. For example, a gene coding for a protein analogous to TLR10 in humans is present in mice, but appears to have been damaged at some point in the past by a retrovirus. On the other hand, mice express TLRs 11, 12, and 13, none of which is represented in humans. Other mammals may express TLRs that are not found in humans. Other non-mammalian species may have TLRs distinct from mammals, as demonstrated by the anti-cell-wall TLR14, which is found in the Takifugu pufferfish. This may complicate the process of using experimental animals as models of human innate immunity.

Vertebrate TLRs are divided by similarity into the families of TLR 1/2/6/10/14/15, TLR 3, TLR 4, TLR 5, TLR 7/8/9, and TLR 11/12/13/16/21/22/23.

===TLRs in &quot;Drosophila&quot; immunity===

The involvement of toll signalling in immunity was first demonstrated in the fruit fly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. Fruit flies have only innate immune responses allowing studies to avoid interference of adaptive immune mechanisms on signal transduction. The fly response to fungal or bacterial infection occurs through two distinct signalling cascades, one of which is the toll pathway and the other is the immune deficiency pathway. The toll pathway is similar to mammalian TLR signalling, but unlike mammalian TLRs, toll is not activated directly by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Its receptor ectodomain recognizes the cleaved form of the cytokine spätzle, which is secreted in the haemolymph as an inactive dimeric precursor. The toll receptor shares the cytoplasmatic TIR domain with mammalian TLRs, but the ectodomain and intracytoplasmatic tail are different. This difference might reflect a function of these receptors as cytokine receptors rather than PRRs.

The toll pathway is activated by different stimuli, such as gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and virulence factors. First, the Spätzle processing enzyme (SPE) is activated in response to infection and cleaves spätzle (&quot;spz&quot;). Cleaved spätzle then binds to the toll receptor and crosslinks its ectodomains. This triggers conformational changes in the receptor resulting in signalling through toll. From this point forward, the signalling cascade is very similar to mammalian signalling through TLRs. The toll-induced signalling complex (TICS) is composed of MyD88, Tube, and Pelle (the orthologue of mammalian IRAK). Signal from TICS is then transduced to Cactus (homologue of mammalian IκB), phosphorylated Cactus is polyubiquitylated and degraded, allowing nuclear translocation of DIF (dorsal-related immunity factor; a homologue of mammalian NF-κB) and induction of transcription of genes for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as drosomycin.

&quot;Drosophila&quot; have a total of 9 &quot;toll&quot; family and 6 &quot;spz&quot; family genes that interact with each other to differing degrees.

=== TLR2 ===

TLR2 has also been designated as CD282 (cluster of differentiation 282).

=== TLR3 ===
TLR3 does not use the MyD88 dependent pathway. Its ligand is retroviral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which activates the TRIF dependent signalling pathway. To explore the role of this pathway in retroviral reprograming, knock down techniques of TLR3 or TRIF were prepared, and results showed that only the TLR3 pathway is required for full induction of target gene expression by the retrovirus expression vector. This retroviral expression of four transcriptional factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc; OSKM) induces pluripotency in somatic cells. This is supported by study, which shows, that efficiency and amount of human iPSC generation, using retroviral vectors, is reduced by knockdown of the pathway with peptide inhibitors or shRNA knockdown of TLR3 or its adaptor protein TRIF. Taken together, stimulation of TLR3 causes great changes in chromatin remodeling and nuclear reprogramming, and activation of inflammatory pathways is required for these changes, induction of pluripotency genes and generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) colonies.

=== TLR11 ===
As noted above, human cells do not express TLR11, but mice cells do. Mouse-specific TLR11 recognizes uropathogenic &quot;E.coli&quot; and the apicomplexan parasite &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. With &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; its ligand is the protein profilin and the ligand for &quot;E. coli&quot; is flagellin. The flagellin from the enteropathogen &quot;Salmonella&quot; is also recognized by TLR11.

As mouse TLR11 is able to recognize &quot;Salmonella&quot; effectively, normal mice do not get infected by oral &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhi, which causes food- and waterborne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans. TLR11 deficient knockout mice, on the other hand, are efficiently infected. As a result, this knockout mouse can act as a disease model of human typhoid fever.

== Summary of known mammalian TLRs ==

Toll-like receptors bind and become activated by different ligands, which, in turn, are located on different types of organisms or structures. They also have different adapters to respond to activation and are located sometimes at the cell surface and sometimes to internal cell compartments. Furthermore, they are expressed by different types of leucocytes or other cell types:

== Ligands ==

Because of the specificity of toll-like receptors (and other innate immune receptors) they cannot easily be changed in the course of evolution, these receptors recognize molecules that are constantly associated with threats (i.e., pathogen or cell stress) and are highly specific to these threats (i.e., cannot be mistaken for self molecules that are normally expressed under physiological conditions). Pathogen-associated molecules that meet this requirement are thought to be critical to the pathogen&#x27;s function and difficult to change through mutation; they are said to be evolutionarily conserved. Somewhat conserved features in pathogens include bacterial cell-surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins, lipopeptides, and lipoarabinomannan; proteins such as flagellin from bacterial flagella; double-stranded RNA of viruses; or the unmethylated CpG islands of bacterial and viral DNA; and also of the CpG islands found in the promoters of eukaryotic DNA; as well as certain other RNA and DNA molecules. As TLR ligands are present in most pathogens, they may also be present in pathogen-derived vaccines (e.g. MMR, influenza, polio vaccines) most commercially available vaccines have been assessed for their inherent TLR ligands&#x27; capacity to activate distinct subsets of immune cells. For most of the TLRs, ligand recognition specificity has now been established by gene targeting (also known as &quot;gene knockout&quot;): a technique by which individual genes may be selectively deleted in mice. See the table above for a summary of known TLR ligands.

=== Endogenous ligands ===

The stereotypic inflammatory response provoked by toll-like receptor activation has prompted speculation that endogenous activators of toll-like receptors might participate in autoimmune diseases. TLRs have been suspected of binding to host molecules including fibrinogen (involved in blood clotting), heat shock proteins (HSPs), HMGB1, extracellular matrix components and self DNA (it is normally degraded by nucleases, but under inflammatory and autoimmune conditions it can form a complex with endogenous proteins, become resistant to these nucleases and gain access to endosomal TLRs as TLR7 or TLR9). These endogenous ligands are usually produced as a result of non-physiological cell death.

== Signaling ==
TLRs are believed to function as dimers. Though most TLRs appear to function as homodimers, TLR2 forms heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6, each dimer having a different ligand specificity. TLRs may also depend on other co-receptors for full ligand sensitivity, such as in the case of TLR4&#x27;s recognition of LPS, which requires MD-2. CD14 and LPS-Binding Protein (LBP) are known to facilitate the presentation of LPS to MD-2.

A set of endosomal TLRs comprising TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 recognize nucleic acid derived from viruses as well as endogenous nucleic acids in context of pathogenic events. Activation of these receptor leads to production of inflammatory cytokines as well as type I interferons (interferon type I) to help fight viral infection.

The adapter proteins and kinases that mediate TLR signaling have also been targeted. In addition, random germline mutagenesis with ENU has been used to decipher the TLR signaling pathways. When activated, TLRs recruit adapter molecules within the cytoplasm of cells to propagate a signal. Four adapter molecules are known to be involved in signaling. These proteins are known as MyD88, TIRAP (also called Mal), TRIF, and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule).

TLR signaling is divided into two distinct signaling pathways, the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathway.

===MyD88-dependent pathway===
The MyD88-dependent response occurs on dimerization of TLRs, and is used by every TLR except TLR3. Its primary effect is activation of NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Ligand binding and conformational change that occurs in the receptor recruits the adaptor protein MyD88, a member of the TIR family. MyD88 then recruits IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. IRAK kinases then phosphorylate and activate the protein TRAF6, which in turn polyubiquinates the protein TAK1, as well as itself to facilitate binding to IKK-β. On binding, TAK1 phosphorylates IKK-β, which then phosphorylates IκB causing its degradation and allowing NFκB to diffuse into the cell nucleus and activate transcription and consequent induction of inflammatory cytokines.

===TRIF-dependent pathway===
Both TLR3 and TLR4 use the TRIF-dependent pathway, which is triggered by dsRNA and LPS, respectively. For TLR3, dsRNA leads to activation of the receptor, recruiting the adaptor TRIF. TRIF activates the kinases TBK1 and RIPK1, which creates a branch in the signaling pathway. The TRIF/TBK1 signaling complex phosphorylates IRF3 allowing its translocation into the nucleus and production of interferon type I. Meanwhile, activation of RIPK1 causes the polyubiquitination and activation of TAK1 and NFκB transcription in the same manner as the MyD88-dependent pathway.

TLR signaling ultimately leads to the induction or suppression of genes that orchestrate the inflammatory response. In all, thousands of genes are activated by TLR signaling, and collectively, the TLRs constitute one of the most pleiotropic yet tightly regulated gateways for gene modulation.

TLR4 is the only TLR that uses all four adaptors. Complex consisting of TLR4, MD2 and LPS recruits TIR domain-containing adaptors TIRAP and MyD88 and thus initiates activation of NFκB (early phase) and MAPK. TLR4-MD2-LPS complex then undergoes endocytosis and in endosome it forms a signaling complex with TRAM and TRIF adaptors. This TRIF-dependent pathway again leads to IRF3 activation and production of type I interferons, but it also activates late-phase NFκB activation. Both late and early phase activation of NFκB is required for production of inflammatory cytokines.
== Medical relevance==
Imiquimod (cardinally used in dermatology) is a TLR7 agonist, and its successor resiquimod, is a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist. Recently, resiquimod has been explored as an agent for cancer immunotherapy, acting through stimulation of tumor-associated macrophages.

Several TLR ligands are in clinical development or being tested in animal models as vaccine adjuvants, with the first clinical use in humans in a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine in 2017, which contains a monophosphoryl lipid A component.

TLR7 messenger RNA expression levels in dairy animals in a natural outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported.

TLR4 has been shown to be important for the long-term side-effects of opioids. Its activation leads to downstream release of inflammatory modulators including TNF-α and IL-1β, and constant low-level release of these modulators is thought to reduce the efficacy of opioid drug treatment with time, and is involved in opioid tolerance, hyperalgesia and allodynia. Morphine induced TLR4 activation attenuates pain suppression by opioids and enhances the development of opioid tolerance and addiction, drug abuse, and other negative side effects such as respiratory depression and hyperalgesia. Drugs that block the action of TNF-α or IL-1β have been shown to increase the analgesic effects of opioids and reduce the development of tolerance and other side-effects, and this has also been demonstrated with drugs that block TLR4 itself.

The &quot;unnatural&quot; enantiomers of opioid drugs such as (+)-morphine and (+)-naloxone lack affinity for opioid receptors, still produce the same activity at TLR4 as their &quot;normal&quot; enantiomers. So, &quot;unnatural&quot; entianomers of opioids such as (+)-naloxone, can be used to block the TLR4 activity of opioid analgesic drugs without having any affinity for μ-opioid receptor

== Discovery ==

When microbes were first recognized as the cause of infectious diseases, it was immediately clear that multicellular organisms must be capable of recognizing them when infected and, hence, capable of recognizing molecules unique to microbes. A large body of literature, spanning most of the last century, attests to the search for the key molecules and their receptors. More than 100 years ago, Richard Pfeiffer, a student of Robert Koch, coined the term &quot;endotoxin&quot; to describe a substance produced by Gram-negative bacteria that could provoke fever and shock in experimental animals. In the decades that followed, endotoxin was chemically characterized and identified as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by most Gram-negative bacteria. This lipopolysaccharide is an integral part of the gram-negative membrane and is released upon destruction of the bacterium. Other molecules (bacterial lipopeptides, flagellin, and unmethylated DNA) were shown in turn to provoke host responses that are normally protective. However, these responses can be detrimental if they are excessively prolonged or intense. It followed logically that there must be receptors for such molecules, capable of alerting the host to the presence of infection, but these remained elusive for many years. Toll-like receptors are now counted among the key molecules that alert the immune system to the presence of microbial infections.

The prototypic member of the family, the &quot;toll&quot; receptor (; Tl) in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, was discovered in 1985 by 1995 Nobel Laureates Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus and colleagues. It was known for its developmental function in embryogenesis by establishing the dorsal-ventral axis. It was named after Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard&#x27;s 1985 exclamation, &quot;&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s amazing!&quot;), in reference to the underdeveloped ventral portion of a fruit fly larva. It was cloned by the laboratory of Kathryn Anderson in 1988. In 1996, &quot;toll&quot; was found by Jules A. Hoffmann and his colleagues to have an essential role in the fly&#x27;s immunity to fungal infection, which it achieved by activating the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides.

The first reported human toll-like receptor was described by Nomura and colleagues in 1994, mapped to a chromosome by Taguchi and colleagues in 1996. Because the immune function of toll in &quot;Drosophila&quot; was not then known, it was assumed that TIL (now known as TLR1) might participate in mammalian development. However, in 1991 (prior to the discovery of TIL) it was observed that a molecule with a clear role in immune function in mammals, the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor, also had homology to drosophila toll; the cytoplasmic portions of both molecules were similar.

In 1997, Charles Janeway and Ruslan Medzhitov showed that a toll-like receptor now known as TLR4 could, when artificially ligated using antibodies, induce the activation of certain genes necessary for initiating an adaptive immune response. TLR 4 function as an LPS sensing receptor was discovered by Bruce A. Beutler and colleagues. These workers used positional cloning to prove that mice that could not respond to LPS had mutations that abolished the function of TLR4. This identified TLR4 as one of the key components of the receptor for LPS.

In turn, the other TLR genes were ablated in mice by gene targeting, largely in the laboratory of Shizuo Akira and colleagues. Each TLR is now believed to detect a discrete collection of molecules — some of microbial origin, and some products of cell damage — and to signal the presence of infections.

Plant homologs of &quot;toll&quot; were discovered by Pamela Ronald in 1995 (rice XA21) and Thomas Boller in 2000 (&quot;Arabidopsis&quot; FLS2).

In 2011, Beutler and Hoffmann were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for their work. Hoffmann and Akira received the Canada Gairdner International Award in 2011.

<text>Valdemar Poulsen (23 November 1869 – 23 July 1942) was a Danish engineer who developed a magnetic wire recorder called the telegraphone in 1898. He also made significant contributions to early radio technology, including the first continuous wave radio transmitter, the Poulsen arc, which was used for a majority of the earliest audio radio transmissions, before being supplanted by the development of vacuum-tube transmitters.

==Early life==
Poulsen was born on 23 November 1869 in Copenhagen. He was the son of the Supreme Court judge Jonas Nicolai Johannes Poulsen and Rebekka Magdalene (née Brandt). He studied natural sciences at the University of Copenhagen from 1889 until 1893, but left before graduating to begin working as an assistant engineer at the technical department of the Copenhagen Telephone Company. Poulsen then left this position in order to work as an independent inventor.

==Recording innovations==


Magnetic recording was demonstrated in principle as early as 1898 by Poulsen in his telegraphone (or telephonograph). Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, employ a magnetizable medium which moves past a recording head. A variable electrical signal, analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the recording head, inducing a magnetization pattern that encoded the signal. A playback head, which may be the same as the recording head, can then pick up the changes in the magnetic field from the wire and convert them into an electrical current, that is reproduced as audio when connected to a telephone receiver.
Poulsen obtained a Telegraphone patent in 1898, and with his assistant, Peder Oluf Pedersen, later developed other magnetic recorders that recorded on steel wire, tape, or disks. None of these devices had electronic amplification, but the recorded signal was strong enough to be heard through a headset or transmitted on telephone wires.

At the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, Poulsen demonstrated the invention, and recorded the voice of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria which is believed to be the oldest surviving magnetic audio recording.

It was anticipated that the Telegraphone would have numerous applications for dictation and recording telephone messages, and could also be used for making repeated announcements by telephone newspapers. One enthusiastic reviewer, noting the 30 minute recording time and other features, predicted that &quot;this instrument will mean almost as much to the business man and to the world at large as does the telephone itself&quot;. However, its complexity and the lack of a means to amplify its recordings greatly limited its adoption, and the invention was financially unsuccessful.

==Radio development==

Poulsen developed an arc converter transmitter in 1903, referred to as the &quot;Poulsen Arc Transmitter&quot;, which was widely used for audio radio transmissions before the advent of vacuum tube technology. This invention made modifications to William Duddell&#x27;s &quot;singing arc&quot; in order to operate at much higher frequencies, which made it a generator of continuous radio waves, which, unlike earlier spark-gap transmisssins, could be used for audio transmissions. The most important modification was the introduction of an atmosphere containing hydrogen in a strong transverse magnetic field.

In 1907 the system was able to communicate between Lyngby and Newcastle with a 100-foot (30m) mast. In 1908 Poulsen telephoned 145 miles (230 km) without wires from Ejerg to Lyngby in Denmark, using only 3 kilowatts, and in 1910 telephoned 295 miles (475 km) from Los Angeles to San Francisco in the United States, using 12 kilowatts. Music played in the Poulsen station in Berlin was received 215 miles (345 km) away at Copenhagen.

The Federal Telegraph Company, specializing in arc transmitters, licensed Poulsen&#x27;s arc for use in the United States, although the company primarily employed high-powered arc transmitters for long distance radiotelegraph communication.

Use of arc transmitters largely ceased in the early 1920s, supplanted by Alexanderson alternators used for long distance telegraphy, and vacuum-tube transmitters. In 1909, Einar Dessau used a shortwave transmitter to establish contact with Paulsen. Beginning in 1907 Lee de Forest employed arc transmitters for early radio broadcasting experimentation, but eventually switched to vacuum-tube transmitters. Recounting the superiority of vacuum-tube transmitters, in his 1950 autobiography de Forest wrote that he had been &quot;totally unaware of the fact that in the little audion tube, which I was then using only as a radio detector, lay dormant the principle of &quot;oscillation&quot; which, had I but realized it, would have caused me to unceremoniously dump into the ash can all of the fine arc mechanisms which I had ever constructed, a procedure which a few years later actually took place all over the world!&quot;

==Personal life==
Poulsen married in 1894 to Frederikke Marie Rasmussen. She died in 1921. In 1923, he married Asta Stoltz Nielsen. In his first marriage, he was the father of the geologist Christian Henrik Otto Poulsen. Poulsen died on 6 August 1942 in Gentofte. He is buried in the local Gentofte Cemetery.

==Honors==
In 1907 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Danish Society for Science, and in 1909 an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Leipzig. He also received the Medal of Merit from the Danish government. At his death he was a fellow of the Danish Academy of Sciences, the Danish Academy of Technical Science and the Swedish Institute for Engineering Research.

==Legacy==
The Valdemar Poulsen Gold Medal was awarded each year for outstanding research in the field of radio techniques and related fields by the . The award was presented on 23 November, the anniversary of his birth, and Poulsen himself received the inaugural award in 1939. The award was discontinued in 1993.

Poulsen is one of the men seen on Peder Severin Krøyer&#x27;s monumental 1904 oil-on-canvas group portrait painting &quot;Men of Industry&quot; (Frederiksborg Castle). A commemorative plaque on the facade of Landemærket 3 in Copenhagen commemorates that Poulsen was born in the building. The plaque was installed in 1043. A Danish stamp was issued marking the centennial of Poulsen&#x27;s birth in 1969.

On 23 November 2018 he was honoured with a Google Doodle for his 149th birthday.

<text>In mathematics, extrapolation is a type of estimation, beyond the original observation range, of the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to interpolation, which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater uncertainty and a higher risk of producing meaningless results. Extrapolation may also mean extension of a , assuming similar methods will be applicable. Extrapolation may also apply to human experience to project, extend, or expand known experience into an area not known or previously experienced. By doing so, one makes an assumption of the unknown (for example, a driver may extrapolate road conditions beyond what is currently visible and these extrapolations may be correct or incorrect). The extrapolation method can be applied in the interior reconstruction problem.

==Method==

A sound choice of which extrapolation method to apply relies on &quot;a priori knowledge&quot; of the process that created the existing data points. Some experts have proposed the use of causal forces in the evaluation of extrapolation methods. Crucial questions are, for example, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, smooth, possibly periodic, etc.

===Linear===

Linear extrapolation means creating a tangent line at the end of the known data and extending it beyond that limit. Linear extrapolation will only provide good results when used to extend the graph of an approximately linear function or not too far beyond the known data.

If the two data points nearest the point formula_1 to be extrapolated are formula_2 and formula_3, linear extrapolation gives the function:

:formula_4

(which is identical to linear interpolation if formula_5). It is possible to include more than two points, and averaging the slope of the linear interpolant, by regression-like techniques, on the data points chosen to be included. This is similar to linear prediction.

===Polynomial===

A polynomial curve can be created through the entire known data or just near the end (two points for linear extrapolation, three points for quadratic extrapolation, etc.). The resulting curve can then be extended beyond the end of the known data. Polynomial extrapolation is typically done by means of Lagrange interpolation or using Newton&#x27;s method of finite differences to create a Newton series that fits the data. The resulting polynomial may be used to extrapolate the data.

High-order polynomial extrapolation must be used with due care. For the example data set and problem in the figure above, anything above order 1 (linear extrapolation) will possibly yield unusable values; an error estimate of the extrapolated value will grow with the degree of the polynomial extrapolation. This is related to Runge&#x27;s phenomenon.
===Conic===

A conic section can be created using five points near the end of the known data. If the conic section created is an ellipse or circle, when extrapolated it will loop back and rejoin itself. An extrapolated parabola or hyperbola will not rejoin itself, but may curve back relative to the X-axis. This type of extrapolation could be done with a conic sections template (on paper) or with a computer.

===French curve===

French curve extrapolation is a method suitable for any distribution that has a tendency to be exponential, but with accelerating or decelerating factors. This method has been used successfully in providing forecast projections of the growth of HIV/AIDS in the UK since 1987 and variant CJD in the UK for a number of years. Another study has shown that extrapolation can produce the same quality of forecasting results as more complex forecasting strategies.

===Geometric Extrapolation with error prediction===

Can be created with 3 points of a sequence and the &quot;moment&quot; or &quot;index&quot;, this type of extrapolation have 100% accuracy in predictions in a big percentage of known series database (OEIS).

Example of extrapolation with error prediction :

: formula_6
: formula_7
: formula_8
: formula_9
: formula_10
: formula_11
: formula_12

==Quality==

Typically, the quality of a particular method of extrapolation is limited by the assumptions about the function made by the method. If the method assumes the data are smooth, then a non-smooth function will be poorly extrapolated.

In terms of complex time series, some experts have discovered that extrapolation is more accurate when performed through the decomposition of causal forces.

Even for proper assumptions about the function, the extrapolation can diverge severely from the function. The classic example is truncated power series representations of sin(&quot;x&quot;) and related trigonometric functions. For instance, taking only data from near the &quot;x&quot; = 0, we may estimate that the function behaves as sin(&quot;x&quot;) ~ &quot;x&quot;. In the neighborhood of &quot;x&quot; = 0, this is an excellent estimate. Away from &quot;x&quot; = 0 however, the extrapolation moves arbitrarily away from the &quot;x&quot;-axis while sin(&quot;x&quot;) remains in the interval [−1,1]. I.e., the error increases without bound.

Taking more terms in the power series of sin(&quot;x&quot;) around &quot;x&quot; = 0 will produce better agreement over a larger interval near &quot;x&quot; = 0, but will produce extrapolations that eventually diverge away from the &quot;x&quot;-axis even faster than the linear approximation.

This divergence is a specific property of extrapolation methods and is only circumvented when the functional forms assumed by the extrapolation method (inadvertently or intentionally due to additional information) accurately represent the nature of the function being extrapolated. For particular problems, this additional information may be available, but in the general case, it is impossible to satisfy all possible function behaviors with a workably small set of potential behavior.

==In the complex plane==

In complex analysis, a problem of extrapolation may be converted into an interpolation problem by the change of variable formula_13. This transform exchanges the part of the complex plane inside the unit circle with the part of the complex plane outside of the unit circle. In particular, the compactification point at infinity is mapped to the origin and vice versa. Care must be taken with this transform however, since the original function may have had &quot;features&quot;, for example poles and other singularities, at infinity that were not evident from the sampled data.

Another problem of extrapolation is loosely related to the problem of analytic continuation, where (typically) a power series representation of a function is expanded at one of its points of convergence to produce a power series with a larger radius of convergence. In effect, a set of data from a small region is used to extrapolate a function onto a larger region.

Again, analytic continuation can be thwarted by function features that were not evident from the initial data.

Also, one may use sequence transformations like Padé approximants and Levin-type sequence transformations as extrapolation methods that lead to a summation of power series that are divergent outside the original radius of convergence. In this case, one often obtains 
rational approximants.

==Fast==
The extrapolated data often convolute to a kernel function. After data is extrapolated, the size of data is increased N times, here N is approximately 2–3. If this data needs to be convoluted to a known kernel function, the numerical calculations will increase Nlog(N) times even with fast Fourier transform (FFT). There exists an algorithm, it analytically calculates the contribution from the part of the extrapolated data. The calculation time can be omitted compared with the original convolution calculation. Hence with this algorithm the calculations of a convolution using the extrapolated data is nearly not increased. This is referred as the fast extrapolation. The fast extrapolation has been applied to CT image reconstruction.

==Extrapolation arguments==
Extrapolation arguments are informal and unquantified arguments which assert that something is probably true beyond the range of values for which it is known to be true. For example, we believe in the reality of what we see through magnifying glasses because it agrees with what we see with the naked eye but extends beyond it; we believe in what we see through light microscopes because it agrees with what we see through magnifying glasses but extends beyond it; and similarly for electron microscopes. Such arguments are widely used in biology in extrapolating from animal studies to humans and from pilot studies to a broader population.

Like slippery slope arguments, extrapolation arguments may be strong or weak depending on such factors as how far the extrapolation goes beyond the known range.

<text>The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) is a committee mandated by the United Nations General Assembly in order to promote the rights of the Palestinian people, support the peace process and to mobilize assistance to the Palestinian people.

The committee meets several times throughout the year in both formal and informal meetings across the globe, including its annual opening session in New York. It also meets every year on 29 November, International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, using the day to encourage member states to support the peace process and Palestinian rights.

== History ==
The committee was founded on 10 November 1975 by Resolution 3376 (XXX) of the General Assembly, which was concerned about the lack of progress in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. The committee&#x27;s mandate is to consider and recommend to the General Assembly a program of implementation in order to allow Palestinians to exercise their right to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty as well as their right of return as laid out in General Assembly Resolution 3236 (XXIX). additionally, over the years, the committee&#x27;s mandate has been expanded to include greater advocacy for the rights of the Palestinian people and the mobilization of assistance.

In 1977 the Special Unit on Palestinian Rights was created by the General Assembly. This unit was created in order to prepare, under the guidance of the committee, studies and publications relating to the rights of the Palestinian people, resolutions relating to Palestinian rights of the various U.N. bodies and the actions the U.N. was taking to promote the attainment of Palestinian rights. In 1979, the unit was redesignated the Division for Palestinian Rights by the General Assembly. This new division would continue to discharge the duties of the special unit, as well as a variety of new functions aiming to establish closer cooperation of the question of Palestine within the U.N. system. The division currently acts as the secretariat of the committee and provides various services including, organizing meetings of the committee and its bureau, organizing a program of international meeting and conferences, maintaining the U.N. Information System on the Question of Palestine and organizing the annual observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, to name a few.

In recent years the General Assembly has requested the committee monitor all aspects of the situation relating to the question of Palestine and to make recommendations to the General Assembly, the Security Council and the secretary-general. The committee also continues to advocate the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, promote a just and peaceful settlement of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and mobilize assistance for Palestinians. It strongly supports the objective of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secure and recognized borders, having put their support behind the 1991 Madrid Conference, the 1993 Declaration of Principles and the Quartet&#x27;s Road Map for Peace. It also continues to support Security Council Resolution 1397 of 12 March 2002, which called for a two-state solution. The committee also convenes international meetings and conferences in various regions of the world, bringing together representatives of governments, intergovernmental and civil society organizations, United Nations system entities, academics, the media and others.

In conjunction with the Division for Palestinian Rights, the committee organizes commemorative activities for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, which is held on 29 November each year. The day commemorates the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 181(II) in 1947, which advocated for the partition of Palestine into two states: one Arab and one Jewish.

<doc id="546431" wikidata="Q29320" url="?curid=546431" title="Thematic Apperception Test">
<text>The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is a projective psychological test developed during the 1930s by Henry A. Murray and Christiana D. Morgan at Harvard University. Proponents of the technique assert that subjects&#x27; responses, in the narratives they make up about ambiguous pictures of people, reveal their underlying motives, concerns, and the way they see the social world. Historically, the test has been among the most widely researched, taught, and used of such techniques.

==History==
The TAT was developed by American psychologist Murray and lay psychoanalyst Morgan at the Harvard Clinic at Harvard University during the 1930s. Anecdotally, the idea for the TAT emerged from a question asked by one of Murray&#x27;s undergraduate students, Cecilia Roberts. She reported that when her son was ill, he spent the day making up stories about images in magazines and she asked Murray if pictures could be employed in a clinical setting to explore the underlying dynamics of personality.

Murray wanted to use a measure that would reveal information about the whole person but found the contemporary tests of his time lacking in this regard. Therefore, he created the TAT. The rationale behind the technique is that people tend to interpret ambiguous situations in accordance with their own past experiences and current motivations, which may be conscious or unconscious. Murray reasoned that by asking people to tell a story about a picture, their defenses to the examiner would be lowered as they would not realize the sensitive personal information they were divulging by creating the story.

Murray and Morgan spent the 1930s selecting pictures from illustrative magazines and developing the test. After 3 versions of the test (Series A, Series B, and Series C), Morgan and Murray decided on the final set of pictures, Series D, which remains in use today. Although she was given first authorship on the first published paper about the TAT in 1935, Morgan did not receive authorship credit on the final published instrument. Reportedly, her role in the creation of the TAT was primarily in the selection and editing of the images, but due to the primacy of the name on the original publication the majority of written inquiries about the TAT were addressed to her; since most of these letters included questions that she could not answer, she requested that her name be removed from future authorship.

During the time Murray was developing the TAT he was also involved in Herman Melville studies. The therapeutic technique originally came to him from the &quot;Doubloon chapter&quot; in Moby Dick. In this chapter, multiple characters inspect the same image (a Doubloon), but each character has vastly different interpretations of the imagery—Ahab sees symbols of himself in the coin, while the religiously devout Starbuck sees the Christian Trinity. Other characters provide interpretations of the image that give more insight into the characters themselves based on their interpretations of the imagery. Crew members, including Ahab, project their self perceptions onto the coin which was nailed to the mast. Murray, a lifelong Melvillist, often maintained that all of Melville&#x27;s oeuvre was for him a TAT.

After World War II, the TAT was adopted more broadly by psychoanalysts and clinicians to evaluate emotionally disturbed patients. Later, in the 1970s, the Human Potential Movement encouraged psychologists to use the TAT to help their clients understand themselves better and stimulate personal growth. In the 1950s the TAT was widely used to support assessment of needs and motives.

==Procedure==
The TAT is popularly known as the &quot;picture interpretation technique&quot; because it uses a series of provocative yet ambiguous pictures about which the subject is asked to tell a story. The TAT manual provides the administration instructions used by Murray, although these procedures are commonly altered. The subject is asked to tell as dramatic a story as they can for each picture presented, including the following:

* what has led up to the event shown
* what is happening at the moment
* what the characters are feeling and thinking
* what the outcome of the story was

If these elements are omitted, particularly for children or individuals of low cognitive abilities, the evaluator may ask the subject about them directly. Otherwise, the examiner is to avoid interjecting and should not answer questions about the content of the pictures. The examiner records stories verbatim for later interpretation.

The complete version of the test contains 32 picture cards. Some of the cards show male figures, some female, some both male and female figures, some of ambiguous gender, some adults, some children, and some show no human figures at all. One card is completely blank and is used to elicit both a scene and a story about the given scene from the storyteller. Although the cards were originally designed to be matched to the subject in terms of age and gender, any card may be used with any subject. Murray hypothesized that stories would yield better information about a client if the majority of cards administered featured a character similar in age and gender to the client.

Although Murray recommended using 20 cards, most practitioners choose a set of between 8 and 12 selected
cards, either using cards that they feel are generally useful, or that they believe will encourage the subject&#x27;s expression of emotional conflicts relevant to their specific history and situation. However, the examiner should aim to select a variety of cards in order to get a more global perspective of the storyteller and to avoid confirmation bias (i.e., finding only what you are looking for).

Many of the TAT drawings consist of sets of themes such as: success and failure, competition and jealousy, feeling about relationships, aggression, and sexuality. These are usually depicted through picture cards.

==Psychometric characteristics==
Thematic apperception tests are meant to evoke an involuntary display of one&#x27;s subconscious. There is no standardization for evaluating one&#x27;s TAT responses; each evaluation is completely subjective because each response is unique. Validity and reliability are, consequently, the largest question marks of the TAT. There are trends and patterns, which help identify psychological traits, but there are no distinct responses to indicate different conditions a patient may or may not have. Medical professionals most commonly use it in the early stages of patient treatment. The TAT helps professionals identify a broad range of issues that their patients may suffer from. Even when individual scoring procedures are examined, the absence of standardization or norms make it difficult to compare the results of validity and reliability research across studies. Specifically, even studies using the same scoring system often use different cards, or a different number of cards. Standardization is also absent amongst clinicians, who often alter the instructions and procedures. Murstein explained that different cards may be more or less useful for specific clinical questions and purposes, making the use of one set of cards for all clients impractical.

===Reliability===
Internal consistency, a reliability estimate focusing on how highly test items correlate to each other, is often quite low for TAT scoring systems. Some authors have argued that internal consistency measures do not apply to the TAT. In contrast to traditional test items, which should all measure the same construct and be correlated to each other, each TAT card represents a different situation and should yield highly different response themes. Lilienfeld and colleagues countered this point by questioning the practice of compiling TAT responses to form scores. Both inter-rater reliability (the degree to which different raters score TAT responses the same) and test–retest reliability (the degree to which individuals receive the same scores over time) are highly variable across scoring techniques. However, Murray asserted that TAT answers are highly related to internal states such that high test-retest reliability should not be expected. Gruber and Kreuzpointner (2013) developed a new method for calculating internal consistency using categories instead of pictures. As they demonstrated in a mathematical proof, their method provides a better fit for the underlying construction principles of TAT, and also achieved adequate Cronbach&#x27;s alpha scores up to .84 

===Validity===
The validity of the TAT, or the degree to which it measures what it is supposed to measure, is low. Jenkins has stated that &quot;the phrase &#x27;validity of the TAT&#x27; is meaningless, because validity is specific not to the pictures, but to the set of scores derived from the population, purpose, and circumstances involved in any given data collection.&quot; That is, the validity of the test would be ascertained by seeing how clinician&#x27;s decisions were assisted based on the TAT. Evidence on this front suggests it is a weak guide at best. For example, one study indicated that clinicians classified individuals as clinical or non-clinical at close to chance levels (57% where 50% would be guessing) based on TAT data alone. The same study found that classifications were 88% correct based on MMPI data. Using TAT in addition to the MMPI reduced accuracy to 80%.

===Alternate considerations===

Despite the conflicting information about the psychometric characteristics of the TAT, proponents have argued that the TAT should not be judged using traditional standards of reliability and validity. According to Holt, &quot;the TAT is a complex method of assessing people, which does not lend itself to the standard rules of thumb about test standards [. . .]&quot; (p. 101). For example, it has been argued that the purpose of the TAT is to reveal a wide range of personality characteristics and complex, nuanced patterns, as opposed to traditional psychological tests that are designed to measure unitary and narrow constructs. Hibbard and colleagues examined several considerations about traditional views of reliability and validity as they apply to the TAT. First, they noted that traditional views of reliability may limit the validity of a measure (such as occurs with multi-faceted concepts in which characteristics are not necessarily related to each other, but are meaningful in combination). Further, Cronbach&#x27;s alpha, a commonly used measure of internal consistency, is dependent on the number of items in scale. For the TAT, most scales use only a small number of cards (with each card treated like an item) so alphas would not be expected to be very high. Many clinicians also discount the importance of psychometrics, believing that generalizability of the findings to a given client&#x27;s situation is more important than generalizing findings to the population.

==Scoring systems==
When he created the TAT, Murray also developed a scoring system based on his need-press theory of personality. Murray&#x27;s system involved coding every sentence given for the presence of 28 needs and 20 presses (environmental influences), which were then scored from 1 to 5, based on intensity, frequency, duration, and importance to the plot. However, implementing this scoring system is time-consuming and was not widely used. Rather, examiners have traditionally relied on their clinical intuition to come to conclusions about storytellers.

Although not widely used in the clinical setting, several formal scoring systems have been developed for analyzing TAT stories systematically and consistently. Three common methods that are currently used in research are the:
&quot;Defense mechanisms manual (DMM)&quot;
: This assesses three defense mechanisms: denial (least mature), projection (intermediate), and identification (most mature). A person&#x27;s thoughts and feelings are projected in stories involved.
&quot;Social cognition and object relations (SCOR)&quot; scale
: This assesses four different dimensions of object relations: Complexity of representations of people, affect-tone of relationship paradigms, capacity for emotional investment in relationships and moral standards, and understanding of social causality.
&quot;Personal problem-solving system—revised (PPSS-R)&quot;
: This assesses how people identify, think about and resolve problems through the scoring of thirteen different criteria. This scoring system is useful because theoretically, good problem-solving ability is an indicator of an individual&#x27;s mental health. Although the TAT is a projective personality technique that is based primarily on the psychoanalytic perspective, the PPSS-R scoring system is designed for clinicians and researchers working from a cognitive behavioral framework. The PPSS-R scoring system has been studied in a wide range of populations, including college students, community residents, jail inmates, university clinic clients, community mental health center clients, and psychiatric day treatment clients. Thus, the PPSS-R scoring system allows clinicians and researchers to assess for problem solving ability and social functioning in many types of people, without being hindered by social desirability effects.

Similar to other scoring systems, with the PPSS-R TAT cards are typically administered individually and examinees&#x27; responses are recorded verbatim. Unlike other scoring systems, the PPSS-R only uses six of the 31 TAT cards: 1, 2, 4, 7BM, 10, and 13MF. The PPSS-R provides information about four different areas related to problem solving ability: Story design, story orientation, story solutions, and story resolution. These four areas are assessed by the 13 scoring criteria, 12 of which are rated on a five-point scale that ranges from -1 to 3.

Each of these scoring categories attempts to measure the following information:
* &quot;Story design&quot; measures the examinee&#x27;s ability to identify and formulate a problem situation.
* &quot;Story orientation&quot; assesses the examinee&#x27;s level of personal control, emotional distress, confidence and motivation.
* &quot;Story solutions&quot; assesses how impulsive the examinee is. In addition to evaluating the types of problem solutions that are provided, the number of problem solutions that examinees provide for each of the TAT cards is summed.
* &quot;Story resolution&quot; provides information on the examinee&#x27;s ability to formulate problem solutions that maximize both short and long-term goals.

Examiners are encouraged to explore information obtained from the TAT stories as hypotheses for testing rather than concrete facts.

==General interpretation==
Interpretation of the responses varies depending on the examiner and the type of scoring used. It is common that the standard scoring systems are used more in research settings than clinical settings. Individuals can select certain scoring systems if they have the goal to evaluate a specific variable such as motivation, defense mechanisms, achievement, problem-solving skills, etc. If a clinician selects not to use a scoring system, there are some general guidelines that can be utilized. For example, the stories created by the individuals in response to the TAT cards are a combination of three things: the card stimulus, the testing environment, and the personality of the examinee. For each card, the individual must subjectively interpret the pictures which involves the individual taking their own experiences and feelings to create a story. Therefore, it is beneficial to look at the common themes in the stories&#x27; content and structure to help make conclusions. Murray states that in the stories built by the person being evaluated there is a hero with whom the subject identifies and to whom he attributes his own motivations. However, there are the characters that interact with this hero, and represent the real social and family environment of the person.

With interpretation of the responses, it is important for the clinician to consider some cautions to verify the information is as accurate as possible. First, the examiner should always be conservative when interpreting responses. It is important to always err on the side of caution instead of making bold conclusions. The examiner should also consider all the data when using the TAT in a testing or evaluative setting. One response should not be given more importance over the other responses. Additionally, the examiner should take the individual&#x27;s developmental status and cultural background into consideration when examining responses. All of these cautions should be considered when an examiner is using the TAT.

==Criticisms==
Like other projective techniques, the TAT has been criticized on the basis of poor psychometric properties (see above). Criticisms include that the TAT is unscientific because it cannot be proved to be valid (that it actually measures what it claims to measure), or reliable (that it gives consistent results over time). As stories about the cards are a reflection of both the conscious and unconscious motives of the storyteller, it is difficult to disprove the conclusions of the examiner and to find appropriate behavioral measures that would represent the personality traits under examination. Characteristics of the TAT that make conclusions based on the stories yielded from TAT cards hard to be disproved have been termed &quot;immunizing tactics.&quot; These characteristics include the Walter Mitty effect (i.e., the assertion that individuals will exhibit high levels of a given trait in TAT stories that do not match their overt behavior because TAT responses may represent how a person wishes they were, not how they truly are) and the inhibition effect (i.e., the assertion that individuals will &quot;not&quot; exhibit high levels of a trait in TAT responses because they are repressing that trait). In addition, as the present needs of the storyteller change over time, it is not expected that later stories will produce the same results.

The lack of standardization of the cards given and scoring systems applied is problematic because it makes comparing research on the TAT very difficult. With a dearth of sound evidence and normative samples, it is tough to determine how much useful information can be gathered in this manner.

Some critics of the TAT cards have observed that the characters and environments are dated, even &quot;old-fashioned&quot;, creating a &quot;cultural or psycho-social distance&quot; between the patients and the stimuli that makes identifying with them less likely. In specific situations it is even hard to identify with people of opposite gender. Also, in researching the responses of subjects given photographs versus the TAT, researchers found that the TAT cards evoked more &quot;deviant&quot; stories (i.e., more negative) than photographs, leading researchers to conclude that the difference was due to the differences in the characteristics of the images used as stimuli.

In a 2005 dissertation, Matthew Narron, Psy.D. attempted to address these issues by reproducing a Leopold Bellak 10 card set photographically and performing an outcome study. The results concluded that the old TAT elicited answers that included many more specific time references than the new TAT.

==Contemporary applications==
Despite criticisms, the TAT continues to be used as a tool for research into areas of psychology such as dreams, fantasies, mate selection and what motivates people to choose their occupation. Sometimes it is used in a psychiatric or psychological context to assess personality disorders, thought disorders, in forensic examinations to evaluate crime suspects, or to screen candidates for high-stress occupations. It is also commonly used in routine psychological evaluations, typically without a formal scoring system, as a way to explore emotional conflicts and object relations.

TAT is widely used in France and Argentina using a psychodynamic approach.

David McClelland and Ruth Jacobs conducted a 12-year longitudinal study of leadership using TAT and found no gender differences in motivational predictors of attained management level. The content analysis, however, &quot;revealed 2 distinct styles of power-related themes that distinguished the successful men from the successful women. The successful male managers were more likely to use reactive power [that is, aggressive] themes while the successful female managers were more likely to use resourceful [that is, nurturing] power themes. Differences between the sexes in the power themes were less pronounced among the managers who had remained in lower levels of management.&quot;

==Popular culture==
Due to the test&#x27;s earlier popularity within psychology, the TAT has appeared in a wide variety of media. For example, the Thomas Harris novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (1981) includes a scene where the imprisoned psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter mocks a previous attempt to administer the test to him. Michael Crichton included the TAT in the battery of tests given to the disturbed main character Harry Benson in his novel &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; (1972). The test is also given to the main characters in two widely differing tales about the human mind: &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962) and Daniel Keyes&#x27;s &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; (1958–1966). Italian poet Edoardo Sanguineti wrote a collection of poetry called &quot;T.A.T&quot; (1966–1968) that refers to the Test.

<doc id="546435" wikidata="Q6459129" url="?curid=546435" title="LMS Princess Royal Class">
<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Princess Royal Class is a class of express passenger 4-6-2 steam locomotive designed by William Stanier. Twelve examples were built at Crewe Works, between 1933 and 1935, for use on the West Coast Main Line. Two are preserved.

==Overview==
The designer of the class, William Stanier, had previously been Works Manager of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s depot at Swindon Works, and had been recruited with a brief to replace the LMS&#x27;s miscellany of locomotives inherited from its constituent companies. He made extensive use of Great Western features in his designs.

To match the power and speed and especially the prestige of the London and North Eastern Railway&#x27;s express Pacific locomotives, Stanier designed the Princess Royal class almost as soon as he was appointed to the LMS. When originally built, they were used to haul the famous &quot;Royal Scot&quot; train between London Euston and Glasgow Central.

==Design==
The class was based on GWR 111 The Great Bear, a design produced in 1907 for the Great Western by George Jackson Churchward. The smokebox and cylinders were closely based on those of the GWR 6000 Class (also known as the King Class). The inside cylinders were abreast the leading bogied wheels and drove cranks on the leading coupled axle, the outside cylinders were abreast the rear bogie wheels (which made substantial cross-bracing necessary between the cylinders and the locomotive frame) and drove crank pins on the centre coupled axle. Each of the four cylinders had its own set of Walschaerts valve gear.

Other minor details, such as corks to close oil boxes, closely followed Great Western practice.

== Construction ==
A prototype batch of three locomotives was to be constructed in 1933. Two were constructed as drawn but the third set of frames was retained as the basis for an experimental turbine locomotive.

=== Turbomotive ===

The third prototype was constructed with the aid of the Swedish Ljungstrom turbine company and known as the Turbomotive, although not named. It was numbered 6202, in sequence with the Princess Royals. Although &#x27;generally similar&#x27; to the rest of the Princess Royals, and &#x27;not all that much different&#x27;, it used a larger 40 element superheater to give a higher steam temperature, more suitable for turbine use. This boiler was also domeless as would later be used for the second batch of the Princess Royals. The continuous exhaust of the turbine, rather than the sharper intermittent blast of the piston engine, also required changes to the draughting and the use of a double chimney. It entered service in June 1935 on the London–Liverpool service.

This &quot;Turbomotive&quot; was rebuilt in 1952 with conventional &#x27;Coronation&#x27; cylinders and named &quot;Princess Anne&quot;, but was soon destroyed in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash.

=== Later production ===
A second batch of eleven locomotives was constructed later. The first two locomotives of the class to be produced had a firebox combustion volume too small for the grate area, and the subsequent locomotives had enlarged fireboxes. 

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 17 April 1948, a passenger train hauled by locomotive No. 6207 &quot;Princess Arthur of Connaught&quot; was halted after a passenger pulled the communication cord. It was then hit from behind by a postal train, which a signalman&#x27;s error had allowed into the section, resulting in the deaths of 24 passengers.
* On 21 September 1951, locomotive No. 46207 &quot;Princess Arthur of Connaught&quot; was hauling an express passenger train that was derailed at Weedon, Northamptonshire due to a defective front bogie on the locomotive. Fifteen people were killed and 35 were injured.
* On 8 October 1952, locomotive No. 46202 &quot;Princess Anne&quot; was one of the locomotives on the 8:00 a.m express from Euston to Liverpool and Manchester, along with LMS Jubilee Class No. 45637 &quot;Windward Islands&quot;. &quot;Princess Anne&quot; took serious damage in the crash, having the leading bogie torn off and main frames buckled, and was scrapped after being deemed uneconomic to repair it.

== Naming ==
Each locomotive was named after a princess, the official name for the class was chosen because Mary, Princess Royal was the Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Scots. However, the locomotives were known to railwaymen as &quot;Lizzies&quot;, after the second example of the class, named for Princess Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth II. Later examples of 4-6-2 express passenger locomotive built by the LMS were of the related but larger, Coronation Class.

== Withdrawal ==
The class was withdrawn in the early 1960s in line with British Railways&#x27; modernisation plan.
==Details==
==Preservation==
Two examples, 6201 &quot;Princess Elizabeth&quot; and 6203 &quot;Princess Margaret Rose&quot; are preserved and both have operated on the mainline in preservation. They were named after the two children of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth, and after the king&#x27;s death, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother). Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary (later Queen Elizabeth II) was seven years old in 1933 when her namesake was built, and Princess Margaret Rose was nearly five in July 1935 when her namesake was completed. At the time, they were third and fourth in line to the throne. &#x27;Princess Margaret Rose&#x27; is owned by The Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and is on static display at the West Shed Museum, Midland Railway-Butterley, Ripley, Derbyshire.

Note: Loco numbers in bold mean their current number.

<doc id="546439" wikidata="Q1970123" url="?curid=546439" title="Thetan">
<text>In Scientology, the concept of the thetan () is similar to the concept of self, or the spirit or soul as found in several belief systems. The term is derived from the Greek letter Θ, theta, which in Scientology beliefs represents &quot;the source of life, or life itself.&quot; In Scientology it is believed that it is the thetan, not the central nervous system, which commands the body.

&quot;Thetan&quot; has been described as:
* A &quot;thetan is an immortal spiritual being; the human soul.&quot;
* &quot;The being who is the individual and who handles and lives in the body.&quot;
* &quot;A thetan is not a thing, a thetan is the creator of things.&quot;
* A thetan is &quot;the person himself—not his body or his name, the physical universe, his mind, or anything else; that which is aware of being aware; the identity which is the individual.&quot;

The concept for the thetan was first described in the early 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard, drawing on reports by Dianetics practitioners, who in session found clients came up with descriptions of past-life experiences. A thetan can be incarnated many times over lifetimes and does not cease to exist at body-death, nor go to a heaven or hell. An important goal in Scientology is to develop a greater awareness and higher levels of ability to operate in the physical universe as an Operating Thetan.

==Thetan in Scientology doctrine==
The term and concept were defined by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, who adopted the Greek letter theta (Θ) to represent &quot;the source of life and life itself&quot;. Hubbard first introduced his ideas of &quot;theta-beings&quot; in a lecture series of March 1952. He attributed the coining of the word to his wife Mary Sue. As an essential point of Scientology doctrine, a person&#x27;s sense of identity and self-awareness stem entirely from the &quot;thetan&quot;. It is redundant to refer to &quot;a person&#x27;s thetan&quot;, because the person does not exist independently.

Hubbard once defined a thetan as: &quot;... having no mass, no wave-length, no energy, no measurable qualities and no time or location in space except by consideration or postulate. The spirit is not a thing. It is the creator of things.&quot; In a lecture series later published as a book (&quot;The Phoenix Lectures&quot;), he jokingly pointed to a study that implied that a &quot;thetan&quot; manifests a small but measurable amount of mass:From some experiments conducted about fifteen or twenty years ago—a thetan weighed about 1.5 ounces ! Who made these experiments? Well, a doctor made these experiments. He weighed people before and after death, retaining any mass. He weighed the person, bed and all, and he found that the weight dropped at the moment of death about 1.5 ounces and some of them 2 ounces [60 grams]. (Those were super thetans!)Although Hubbard did not name the doctor concerned, there was indeed such an attempt, by Duncan MacDougall, to measure the weight of dying patients to determine the weight of the soul, although MacDougall&#x27;s experiments took place about fifty years before Hubbard&#x27;s lectures, not fifteen or twenty, and are generally not regarded as having any scientific validity.

According to Hubbard&#x27;s son Ronald DeWolf (born L. Ron Hubbard Jr.), his father stated that thetans are immortal and perpetual, having willed themselves into existence at some point several trillion years ago. After they originated, thetans generated &quot;points to view&quot; or &quot;dimension points&quot;, causing space to come into existence. They agreed that other thetans&#x27; dimension points existed, thus bringing into existence the entire universe.

In the primordial past, according to Scientologist teachings, thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure.&quot; The universe is thought to have no independent reality, but to derive its apparent reality from the fact that most thetans agree it exists. Scientologists believe that thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation, rather than their original state of spiritual purity. Eventually, they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.

Thetans are believed to be reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called &quot;assumption&quot; which is analogous to reincarnation. Dell deChant and Danny Jorgensen liken Scientology to Hinduism, in that both ascribe a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one&#x27;s present life. With each rebirth, the effects of the MEST universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan are believed to become stronger. Scientologists believe that the thetan has been &quot;embodied on many occasions&quot;, but they generally avoid the term &quot;reincarnation&quot;. They also reject the idea of transmigration, &quot;i.e. the belief that the thetan would incarnate into any animal less than human.&quot; Scientology&#x27;s first phase has to do with removing &quot;encumbrances acquired in this life and in past existences,&quot; J. Gordon Melton writes. According to Melton, these encumbrances are called &quot;engrams&quot; and are &quot;described as aberrations attached to the self that produce dysfunctional behavior patterns.&quot;

Jon Atack, whose book &quot;A Piece of Blue Sky&quot; details how he reached Operating Thetan level V before leaving Scientology, describes Hubbard&#x27;s doctrines about thetans: &quot;Thetans are all-knowing beings, and became bored because there were no surprises. Hubbard asserted that the single most important desire in all beings is to have a &#x27;game&#x27;. To have a &#x27;game&#x27; it was necessary to &#x27;not know&#x27; certain things, so certain perceptions were negated (&#x27;not-is-ed&#x27;).&quot; Since thetans knew everything, this required them to abandon or suppress perceptions and knowledge. Over time, the loss of perception accumulated and certain thetans began to cause harm to others. MEST (physical) beings also sought to &quot;trap&quot; thetans in order to control them. Thetans came to learn contrition, punishing themselves for their own &quot;harmful&quot; acts.

According to Hubbard, an essential part of the thetans&#x27; game was the &quot;conquest&quot; of matter, energy, space, and time by the life force, theta. This has produced multiple universes which have ended and begun in succession, each new one being more solid and entrapping than the last. The thetans have by now become so enmeshed in the physical universe that many have identified themselves totally with it, forgetting their quadrillions of years of existence and their original godly powers.

According to Scientology, thetan powers are said to remain potent and restorable. One of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s stated goals is &quot;the rehabilitation of the human spirit&quot;, by which it means the restoration of the thetan&#x27;s original abilities. Hubbard claims that thetans are able to change reality through &quot;postulates&quot;—decisions made by the individual about the nature of the reality around them. Some thetans are said to have (mis)used this ability to &quot;implant&quot; others with hypnotic suggestions, forcing other thetans to &quot;cluster&quot; around bodies (hence body thetans). This sort of directed control is referred to as &quot;other-determinism&quot;. Scientology seeks to undo it and return the thetan to &quot;self-determinism&quot;, where he can control himself and his environment. The eventual goal is to achieve &quot;pan-determinism&quot;, where he acts for the good of all.

The Scientological notion of the thetan differs from other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, in three significant ways. While other belief systems &quot;fuse the concept of the body and soul&quot;, the thetan is &quot;separate and independent&quot;. Also unlike the Judeo-Christian tradition, Scientologists believe that the thetan has &quot;lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes.&quot; Third, different from the Christian notion of original sin, Scientology believes that the thetan is basically good, but &quot;has lost touch with its true nature.&quot;

Religious scholar Richard Holloway writes that thetans were not created, but they created themselves, adopting and creating the human body as a vehicle for existence.

==Thetans and death== 
Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos described in a 1990 article in the &quot;LA Times&quot; how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a &quot;landing station&quot; on the planet Venus, where the thetan is re-implanted and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, &quot;capsule&quot; it, and send it back to Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, &quot;If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like she is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you&#x27;re all set. And if you can find the maternity ward to a hospital or something, you&#x27;re OK. And you just eventually just pick up a baby.&quot;

While Hubbard&#x27;s concept of the thetan led to the development of an elaborate cosmology, the doctrinal structure he created is based on the following propositions: &quot;Man is an immortal spiritual being. His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.&quot;

==Operating Thetan==
According to Scientology doctrine, a thetan exists whether operating a human body or not. Scientology advertises itself as being able to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; the thetan of a practitioner to a state where the individual can operate with or without a &quot;flesh body&quot;. The term &quot;operating thetan&quot; would then apply as it does when an individual is operating a body. The Operating Thetan (OT) levels are the upper-level courses in Scientology.

The Church defines &quot;Operating Thetan&quot; as &quot;knowing and willing cause over life, thought, and matter, energy, space and time (MEST).&quot;

The Church of Scientology states as a point of doctrine that an individual exists with or without a body.

==Cleared Theta Clear==
Even beyond the Operating Thetan levels comes the &quot;Cleared Theta Clear&quot;, a godlike state which Hubbard describes this way:
A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move MEST and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence.

==Body thetan==
A body thetan is a disincarnate thetan who is &quot;stuck&quot; in, on or near a human body, and all human bodies are said to be infested by these disembodied thetans, or clusters of them. This information is not revealed until a Scientologist reaches Section III of the Operating Thetan levels (commonly referred to as &quot;OT III&quot;). Body thetans were said by Hubbard to be a result of a prehistoric &quot;Incident&quot; involving Xenu.

<doc id="546440" wikidata="Q218026" url="?curid=546440" title="International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People">
<text>The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People () is a UN-organized observance. Events are held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, as well as at the United Nations offices at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi. It is generally held on November 29 each year to mark the anniversary of Resolution 181 which advocated for the partition of Palestine into two States: one Arab and one Jewish. In 2003, it was observed on December 1.

On this day every year, the United Nations urges immediate action in an effort to grant Palestinians sovereignty and independence from the Israeli Occupation. As the international community commemorates this day, it continues to call on Israel to provide Palestinians with their human rights according to the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly emphasizes its support of the Palestinians&#x27; right to return to their homes, which they have been displaced from in 1948 following the creation of the State of Israel, where more than 760,000 Palestinians became refugees.

The annual observance was established in UN General Assembly Resolution 32/40 B of 2 December 1977, to start in 1978. The same resolution proposed the creation of the study &quot;The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem&quot;.

In Resolution 34/65 D of 12 December 1979, the issue of commemorative postage stamps was requested.

Special commemorative activities are organized by the Division for Palestinian Rights of the United Nations Secretariat, in consultation with the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.

In 2001, several members and speakers at the United Nations event for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinians urged the creation of an &quot;International Force in the Occupied Territories to protect the Palestinian people.&quot; Several countries including Malta, Turkey, and Bangladesh showed their solidarity with Palestinians to gain sovereignty.

In 2005, the UN event included a map that showed all of Israel replaced by Palestine and was attended by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other senior UN officials.

In 2018, professor and activist Marc Lamont Hill spoke at the United Nations, expressing his full support for the Palestinian cause. His speech received backlash as many saw his sentiments as anti-Semitic and he was later fired from CNN.

Marking the day in 2021, Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres tweeted, &quot;The situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory remains a challenge to int&#x27;l peace &amp; security.&quot;

In the wake of the Gaza war, Bahraini Member of Parliament Mohammed Musa al-Balooshi delivered a speech criticising the presence of the American, British, and French ambassadors at the 2023 Palestinian Solidarity commemoration, likening their attendance to &quot;killing a victim and then mourning at their funeral&quot; due to these countries&#x27; support of Israel. He then left the event in protest.

<doc id="546444" wikidata="Q6884054" url="?curid=546444" title="Mixing (physics)">
<text>In physics, there are several distinct notions of mixing, all of which try to capture the common-sense notion of mixing, but using rather disparate formal methods, techniques and definitions. One approach is to focus on mixtures of fluids, in three-dimensional space, described by differential equations suitable for fluids, such as the Navier–Stokes equations. The route to the final mixed state typically proceeds through turbulence created during mixing. A second approach considers the mixing of aggregates, such as rocks and sand, which are lumpy on the small scale; this is commonly seen in mixing in process engineering. A third approach uses the mathematical formalisms of measure theory and measure-preserving dynamical systems, to define mixing abstractly for generic dynamical systems in arbitrary dimensions. For example, by assigning a position and a velocity to each atom in a fluid, the mixing takes place in a formula_1-dimensional space, where formula_2 is approximately the Avogadro number and formula_3 is the dimension of the phase space (position plus velocity) of a single atom.

== Mixing of fluids ==

The mixing of gases or liquids is a complex physical process, governed by a convective diffusion equation that may involve non-Fickian diffusion as in spinodal decomposition. The convective portion of the governing equation contains fluid motion terms that are governed by the Navier–Stokes equations. When fluid properties such as viscosity depend on composition, the governing equations may be coupled. There may also be temperature effects.

== Mixing of aggregates ==

Small rigid objects (such as rocks) are sometimes mixed in a rotating drum or tumbler. The 1969 Selective Service draft lottery was carried out by mixing plastic capsules which contained a slip of paper (marked with a day of the year).

== Dynamical systems ==
A dynamical system is said to be mixing if the phase space of the system becomes strongly intertwined over time, according to at least one of several formal mathematical definitions. For example, a measure-preserving transformation &quot;T&quot; is said to be strong mixing if 
: formula_4
whenever formula_5 and formula_6 are any measurable sets and formula_7 is the associated measure. Other definitions are possible, including weak mixing and topological mixing.

The above definition of mixing is meant to capture the intuitive notion of physical mixing. A canonical example is the Cuba libre: suppose one is adding rum (the set formula_5) to a glass of cola. After stirring the glass (the transformation formula_9 for large formula_10), the bottom half of the glass (the set formula_6) will contain rum, and it will be in equal proportion as it is elsewhere in the glass. The mixing is uniform: no matter which region formula_6 one looks at, some of formula_5 will be in that region. The use of formula_14 in the definition, instead of formula_9, is required because the time evolution transformation formula_16 is typically not an injective function (one-to-one). That is, if formula_16 maps two points into one, the measure is preserved only by counting the two points in the pre-image, instead of one point in the image.

Every mixing transformation is ergodic, but there are ergodic transformations which are not mixing.

<doc id="546459" wikidata="Q4649067" url="?curid=546459" title="A259 road">
<text>The A259 is a road on the south coast of England passing through Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex, and Kent, and is the longest Zone 2 A road in Great Britain. The main part of the road connects Brighton, Peacehaven, Eastbourne, Hastings, Rye, and Folkestone.

The road is below the expected standard of a trunk road used by HGVs and a frequent cause of congestion and disruption and has been documented as one of the most dangerous roads in South England.

==Description==

The A259 is a busy two-lane road running along the south coast of England; part is roughly parallel to the A27 road. The A259 runs east from Emsworth in Hampshire, into West Sussex via Chichester, Bognor Regis, Littlehampton, Ferring, Worthing, Lancing, Shoreham-by-Sea, into the Unitary Authority of Brighton and Hove which incorporates Portslade, Hove and Brighton, and on into the East Sussex towns of Peacehaven, Newhaven, Seaford, Eastbourne, Pevensey, Bexhill-on-Sea, Hastings and Rye. Over the border in Kent, it continues through New Romney and Hythe to terminate at Folkestone.

The road passes through Winchelsea, England&#x27;s first new town. The road has two sections with Trunk Road status (between Bognor Regis and Chichester, and between Pevensey and the A2070 at Brenzett) and formed part of the formerly designated South Coast Trunk Road. This section of A259 is almost entirely a single-carriageway, with only a short stretch of urban dual-carriageway in Bexhill.

Landmarks on the A259 include The Body Shop headquarters outside of Littlehampton, Shoreham Power Station, West Pier, and the Palace Pier in Brighton, Telscombe Cliffs near Peacehaven, and Saltdean, Cuckmere Haven between Seaford and Eastbourne and the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway which shares the route for from New Romney to Hythe.

== Safety ==
In June 2008, a stretch of the A259 between Hastings and Eastbourne was named by EuroRAP as the most dangerous road in the South East of England. The report cited 47 fatal or serious collisions from 2004 to 2006 as a key issue. In 2011, the BBC named the road as the &quot;most crash prone A road&quot; in the UK with 7,721 crashes and 120 deaths over 12 years from 1999 to 2010, an average of 65 crashes per mile.

==Traffic==
The road crosses the Marshlink line between and at two level crossings in quick succession. In the summer, this can create significant congestion where goods vehicles between the towns mix with day traffic to popular holiday destinations such as Camber Sands. Portions of the road along Romney Marsh suffer from subsidence into the dikes that run alongside the main carriageway.

==History==
What is now the A259 east of Rye was developed after the opening of the Monk Bretton Bridge in 1893, which provided a quicker route through Romney Marsh. The original draft route of the A259 was from Dover to Eastbourne. It was extended westwards to Worthing after the local engineering division informed the Ministry of Transport they would like a single number to represent the coast road.

In 1989 the government proposed to dual the road from Pevensey to Bexhill and make other corridor improvements as detailed in their Roads for Prosperity white paper and would have included the following elements: &#x27;Guestling and Icklesham bypass&#x27;, the &#x27;Winchelsea bypass&#x27;, &#x27;Rye bypass&#x27;, &#x27;Hamstreet bypass&#x27;, &#x27;A259 New Romney bypass&#x27; and the &#x27;A259 St. Mary&#x27;s Bay and Dymchurch bypass&#x27;. This scheme along with many others proposed at the time were shelved in 1996-7 after a number of major road protests in the UK. Of these only the Ham Street bypass (A2070) was eventually constructed.

Plans for a &#x27;Hastings Bexhill bypass&#x27; which would have provided a dual-carriageway from the Pevensey roundabout passing to the north of Bexhill and Hastings to join the current A259 near Icklesham at a cost of £120-£130 million were rejected in 2001. The scheme, which was supported by the South East England Regional Assembly and by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott was opposed by English Nature who highlighted the damage to a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), including the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. They were also concerned about the negative effect the scheme would have on several ancient woodlands and the habitats of the dormouse and great crested newt.

Following the upgrade of the A2070 road in the late 1990s, the section between Brenzett and Folkestone was de-trunked in 2003 (i.e. removed trunk road status) and control reverted to Kent County Council.

Other development proposals for the road were considered in 2004.

In 2021, Eccy de Jonge, a British author, published an account of policing practices in Great Britain and elsewhere. In a chapter on road deaths, the author reveals two pedestrian deaths on the A259 that occurred in 2013, one near Seaford, East Sussex, the other in Hastings.

==Proposed developments==

===Bexhill to Hastings link road===

In 2008, East Sussex County Council proposed building a new link road between Bexhill and Hastings, to form a long road from its junction with the A259 in Bexhill, to a junction with the B2092 Queensway in Hastings.

The South East Regional Assembly included the scheme within its Regional Funding Advice package. This was provisionally signed off in July 2009 by the Department for Transport, with the caveat that individual schemes would still need to be assessed for value for money and compatibility with greenhouse gas emission targets. Although originally estimated at £45 million, the scheme was now expected to cost over £100 million. £33 million was expected to come from developer contributions, but the County Council was unable to obtain them. &quot;Although opportunities will be explored to seek developer contributions in the future, at the present it has been considered prudent to plan to fund all future local contributions from the County Council&#x27;s capital programme&quot;.

The county council said: &quot;The driving force of the scheme is to enable essential economic regeneration for Bexhill and Hastings, which is currently compromised by the poor accessibility within and between the two towns... the Bexhill Hastings Link Road would make a major contribution to meeting the need to improve access between the towns and linking Trunk Roads which serve the area&quot;. They also identified that the scheme would provide &quot;faster and more reliable access to the Conquest Hospital&quot;, &quot;easier access to jobs&quot;, &quot;create access to much-needed additional housing&quot;; and that it would &quot;re-route traffic from less suitable roads&quot; and &quot;reduce the number of accidents on local roads&quot;.

A number of organisations objected to the scheme. The Hastings Alliance, which is supported by 11 national bodies, including the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for National Parks, and WWF-UK, and also 16 local groups pointed to the Hastings Five Point Plan, commissioned by the South East Regional Assembly, which found that the key requirement for regeneration is to &quot;improve the strategic accessibility of Hastings – that is Hastings&#x27; access to London, other major towns, and other parts of the South East&quot; and says that improving rail links are fundamental to regenerating that area. In addition they objected to the impact on the Combe Haven valley, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, which would be cut in two by the scheme. The Campaign for Better Transport say that, contrary to government guidance, the county council had &quot;never really considered whether building a link road is the best way to improve transport on the Sussex coast&quot;. The Woodland Trust also objected, as the road would seriously impact on the Marline Valley Woods Site of Special Scientific Interest, an ancient ghyll woodland. This sort of woodland is only found on steep sided valleys and are hugely important for wildlife but are highly sensitive to pollution. The road would also pass within metres of Church wood (ancient woodland), and other nationally and locally protected wildlife sites. Friends of the Earth were concerned that building roads generates more traffic in the surrounding area, and would result in more vehicles using the roads to the north creating pressure in for communities on the approach roads (such as the A21 and the A28). They also believed it would create pressure to build a &#x27;Hastings Eastern Bypass&#x27; which would pass through the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which they claim is one of Britain&#x27;s finest landscapes. The Sussex Wildlife Trust &quot;strongly&quot; objected to the road stating that &quot;the environmental damage that will result from this scheme is unacceptable and will alter the ecology of the Combe Haven valley for ever.&quot;

A public inquiry into the scheme started on 10 November 2009.

When the Bexhill to Hastings Link Road was eventually approved, then changes also required to the A21 Baldslow / Queensway (which leads to the link road).

The entire project was completed in December 2015 at a cost of around £120 million.

===&#x27;£5m improvements near Shoreham&#x27;===
In 2009, Brighton and Hove City Council, Adur District Council and West Sussex County Council, and the Shoreham Port Authority proposed to spend a £5million grant from the Department for Transport to &#x27;improve the A259 in relation to a new project to build 10,000 homes scheme.

<text>The Ford Probe is a liftback coupé produced by Ford, introduced in 1988 and produced until 1997. The Probe was the result of Ford&#x27;s collaboration with its longtime Japanese partner Mazda, and both generations of Probe were derived from the front-wheel drive Mazda G platform that underpinned the Mazda Capella.

The Probe succeeded the Ford EXP, and the instrument cluster of the first-generation Probe and pop-up headlight mechanisms were borrowed from the FC Series RX-7.

Based on the Mazda MX-6 as a sport compact coupe, the Probe was intended to fill the market niche formerly occupied by the Capri in Europe, and it was originally intended to be the fourth generation Ford Mustang in the North American market as a direct competitor with the Acura Integra, Isuzu Impulse, Nissan 200SX, and the Toyota Celica. During that time, Ford&#x27;s marketing team had deemed that a front-wheel drive platform (borrowed Mazda GD and GE platforms) would have lower costs for production, and also because the platform had been gaining popularity with consumers.

Mustang fans objected to the front-wheel drive configuration, Japanese engineering, and lack of a V8, so Ford began work on a new design for the Mustang instead. On March 17, 1997, Ford announced the discontinuation of the Probe.

== Background ==
Starting in the late 1970s, Ford and Ghia started exploring a series of futuristic designs with the &quot;Probe&quot; series of concept vehicles. The Probe I, first shown in 1979, was a wedge-shaped design that incorporated a number of drag-reducing features like covered rear wheels and pop-up headlights. This was followed the next year by a much more conventional looking Probe II, whose hatchback styling was also reminiscent of the pony cars. The 1981 Probe III was an advanced demonstrator with covered wheels, but its bodywork evolved into the more conventional Ford Sierra (or Merkur XR4Ti) and styling notes that were used on the Ford Taurus. The 1983 Probe IV was a more radical concept car with a low Cd (drag coefficient), and evolved into the equally radical 1985 Probe V.

After the 1979 energy crisis, the economic slump initiated by high fuel prices prompted Ford to give the Ford Mustang a major redesign. The new design would be based on a totally new platform introduced to Ford by Japanese automaker Mazda, who had been partnering with Ford since 1971, and whom Ford had owned a 25% stake in since 1979. Toshi Saito, a North American-based designer working for Ford, took the lead in envisioning styling directions for the front-wheel drive Mustang, and a design by Saito was chosen and finalized in early 1984. The project was then transferred to Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan and in internal Ford parlance, was referred to by the codename &quot;ST-16&quot;. It was intended to gradually phase out the RWD Fox platform Mustang under the name &quot;Mustang Classic&quot; and have it eventually supplanted by the ST-16 as the &quot;Mustang.&quot;

By 1985, Mazda acquired the former Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, and intended to commence production of the two Mazda-badged GD platform cars for North America, the 626 along with the MX-6, and the ST-16, contracted by Ford, in 1987.

Christopher Sawyer, writing for AutoWeek magazine, in their issue for April 13, 1987, was the first to publicly reveal the existence of the ST-16 Mustang in a sensational report that featured an artist rendering on the issue&#x27;s cover of a vehicle nearly identical to what would be released as the 1989 Ford Probe GT stating &quot;Exclusive: The &#x27;89 Mustang,&quot; along with detailed technical reports about its Mazda origins and switch to front-wheel drive. The public outcry was immediate, with many Mustang fans and pony car purists detesting the ST-16&#x27;s Japanese engineering, front-wheel drive platform and lack of a V8 engine, which were anathema to traditional Mustang buyers and enthusiasts. Ford Motor Company executives, along with many car magazines received strongly-worded letters of criticism decrying the decision.

Neil Ressler, the then-chief of small car engineering at Ford, spoke about the internal cultural differences at Ford Motor Company which led to a strong disagreement between two factions that had radically different notions about what the Mustang should be:

By 1987, Alex Trotman, the newly appointed vice president in charge of Ford&#x27;s North American operations, with strong urging from Ford Marketing vice president Bob Rewey, a dedicated performance enthusiast, decided that in the light of consumer outrage, the ST-16 would not make a suitable Mustang. At this point, somewhat ironically, Mustang sales, which were lackluster, grew substantially after the article&#x27;s publication, out of fear that it would be the last opportunity to purchase a traditional RWD V8 Mustang. While Trotman approved the development of a RWD successor, there were many difficulties, notably that the engineering budget for the Mustang was spent on the ST-16 and Ford was still recovering from a financial crisis of the early 1980s that brought the company close to bankruptcy until the Taurus arrived.

John Coletti, Ford&#x27;s small-car engineering manager and a vociferous opponent of the ST-16 Mustang, said of the project, &quot;I would rather have seen the Mustang name die than put the Mustang name on the Probe ...&quot;.

Ken Dabrowski, Ford&#x27;s small-car line manager, tapped Coletti to lead a skunkworks team that would develop a RWD Mustang successor with the understanding there would not be a full budget to create an entirely new car. Coletti&#x27;s team heavily revised the 1979 Fox platform for the new car, which eventually became the fourth-generation Ford Mustang released for the 1994 model year.

However, production for the ST-16 was about to commence, meaning Ford had to put it on sale or lose its development budget along with further potential financial headaches if Ford would break its production contract with Mazda. It was decided that the ST-16 would be released as the Ford Probe in 1988, taking the name from Ford&#x27;s line of futuristic concept vehicles, and be sold alongside the Mustang, which would continue production in its then-current form with minor refreshing. Instead of being aimed as a successor to the Mustang or as a rival to its traditional competitors, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, Ford would aim the Probe against popular imported sports coupes of the era such as the Toyota Celica and Honda Prelude.

Both generations of the Probe were sold in Japan as Fords, at Ford/Mazda sales channels called Autorama. Japanese models were not in compliance with Japanese Government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, resulting in Japanese buyers being held liable for additional taxes as a result.

The Probe was a sales success in its first model year, owing to its futuristic styling and enjoyable driving experience. In fact, demand exceeded supply in 1988, enough that buyers were paying list price or higher for a Probe, and Jim Mateja, the automotive columnist for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, urged potential Probe buyers who couldn&#x27;t find a Probe to consider its sibling, the Mazda MX-6. Sales of the first-generation Probe were successful enough that Ford partnered with Mazda again, with further Ford engineering from the beginning of the project, to create a second-generation Probe for the 1993 model year developed alongside a second-generation Mazda MX-6. A proposed third-generation Probe, which would have been based on the Ford Mondeo instead of being Mazda-derived, was eventually released as the 1999 Mercury Cougar in the North American market to strengthen the Mercury brand. After disappointing sales of the Cougar and the waning popularity of front-wheel drive sport coupes in the late 1990s in favor of sport utility vehicles, Ford left the market segment with the 2002 discontinuation of the Cougar, and the 2003 discontinuation of the ZX2.

== First generation (1989) ==
The first generation Ford Probe was based on the Mazda GD platform, and was powered by a 2.2 L SOHC 12-valve 4-cylinder Mazda F2 engine. It debuted in 1988 for the 1989 model year and was produced until 1992 in the United States in Flat Rock, Michigan. The Probe was available in several trim levels that differ depending on the market in which the vehicle was sold. In the United States, the Probe was available in GL, LX, and GT trim levels:
* The GL was the base model with the / F2 2.2 L 4-cylinder engine and few options. Most Probes sold in the United States were equipped with air conditioning.
* The LX added options for power locks, power windows, electrically adjusted exterior mirrors, a storage tray underneath the front passenger seat, as well as an optional flip-up moon roof. Starting in 1990, the LX was available with the 3.0 L &quot;Vulcan&quot; V6 engine, that was also used in the Ford Taurus, Ford Ranger, Ford Tempo, and Ford Aerostar. The LX package offered optional equipment, such as a single-disc CD player, and a digital instrument cluster coupled with a fuel economy computer installed in a hidden compartment on top of the center dashboard air conditioning vents.
* The GT included all the equipment of the LX, but featured the F2T 2.2 L turbocharged, intercooled 4-cylinder engine that produced and of torque. It came with an IHI RHB5-VJ11 turbocharger and an intercooler to the intake tract, as well as a knock sensor and electronic boost controller to the engine-control system. The boost pressure was in the vicinity of 2,500 rpm. The GT version also came with 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, a 3-way adjustable suspension utilizing variable damping shocks, and a speed-sensitive variable-assist power steering (VAP). The Probe GT&#x27;s suspension system was based on a Mazda design, but its tuning was different and included nitrogen-gas pressurized front and rear struts, with stabilizer bars.

The 1991 Probe was given a 4-star crash rating in collision tests conducted by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

== Second generation (1993) ==
The Ford and Mazda design teams merged once again to give the Ford Probe a complete redesign for the 1993 model year. As before, the Probe was to share its under-structure with Mazda&#x27;s MX-6 and 626. Mazda engineered the engine, transmission, and chassis, while Ford engineered the body and interior. Technically, the second generation Probe is 60% Mazda and 40% Ford. Despite the car being extended and widened it was lighter than the first generation Probe. The second generation Probe was introduced in August 1992 as a 1993 model. As first planned during 1992, it finally went on sale in Europe in the spring of 1994, filling the gap left there by Ford in that market sector since the demise of the Capri seven years earlier. The Capri had regularly been one of Britain&#x27;s 10 best selling cars throughout the 1970s, but its popularity declined in the early 1980s as Ford launched high performance versions of the Fiesta, Escort and Sierra hatchbacks. Such was the falling demand for this type of car that by 1986, when the end of Capri production was announced, Ford decided against launching a direct replacement.

The second-generation Probe was designed by a team led by Mimi Vandermolen, who led the interior design of the 1986 Ford Taurus. In 1987, Vandermolen became the first female designer to be the design executive of small cars for an automobile manufacturer, and Vandermolen designed the Probe to improve the driving experience for women, stating &quot;If I can solve all the problems inherent in operating a vehicle for a woman, that&#x27;ll make it that much easier for a man to use.&quot;

However, the late 1980s and early 1990s saw the sales of affordable sports cars recover, first with a rising demand for Japanese built models like the Honda Prelude, Nissan Silvia, Mitsubishi Eclipse, and Toyota Celica, and then with the Volkswagen Corrado and the Vauxhall/Opel Calibra from Ford&#x27;s direct competitor General Motors. By 1992, Ford had decided that there was now justifiable demand in Europe for a new affordable sports coupe to be launched.

Ford had been hoping to sell around 20,000 Probes each year in Britain as the car market recovered from the effects of the recession from 1992, but in the three years it was sold there, a total of just over 15,000 were sold - around a quarter of the projected figure for that length of time. Imports ceased during 1997, and its Cougar successor - launched a year later - was even less successful, being imported to Europe for just two years.

By February 2016, just 718 examples of the Probe were still in use in Britain.

The base model started at just over US$13,000 and came standard with the 2.0 L Mazda FS 16-valve 4-cylinder engine, performance instrument cluster with tachometer and full gauge complement, and an electronic AM/FM stereo. The sportier GT model started at $15,504 and came standard with the 2.5 L Mazda K engine KL-DE 24-valve V6, low profile P225/50VR16 91V Goodyear VR50 Gatorback tires, 4-wheel disc brakes, unique front and rear fascias, fog lights, 5-spoke aluminum wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and driver-seat power lumbar/seat back side bolster adjustment. Both engines featured dual overhead cam designs with the choice of a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Two automatic transmissions were available in the Probe. At first both engines shared the same automatic transmission, the Ford F-4EAT transmission, but from 1994 onwards this changed. The V6 engine continued to use the 4EAT, but the 2.0 L I4 engine used a different automatic transmission, the Ford CD4E transmission. It was sourced by Ford, and manufactured at Ford&#x27;s Batavia Transmission plant in Batavia, Ohio.

A new SE (Sport Edition) trim level was available for 1995 and 1996. It included the GT front fascia (without fog lamps), unique aluminum wheels, P205/55R15 BSW and Sport Edition &quot;SE&quot; nomenclature.

In a coast to coast road test by Automobile Magazine in search of the best cars in the world, the Probe GT scored third place, behind an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz and an $80,000 BMW. In the article, the Probe listed at about $15,000.

===Special editions===
For 1993 and 1994, Ford offered a &quot;SE&quot; appearance package on the base model Probe. The package offered 3 spoke swirl-style alloy wheels, the GT model&#x27;s ground effects, and the GT model&#x27;s front bumper. Unlike the base model, buyers were able to opt for power windows and mirrors on the SE package. Appearance wise, the only noticeable differences from the GT model were the wheels, &quot;SE&quot; nomenclature, rear bumper w/o air slot and lack of fog lights. &quot;SE&quot; was an appearance package and not an actual model or trim level. &quot;SE&quot; became a trim level in 1995 and was the middle-grade model in the Probe lineup between base and GT models.

In 1994, Ford released a limited edition of the Probe, marketed as the Probe &quot;Feature Car&quot;, but officially called the &quot;GT Plus&quot; package. This special package is better known to the general public and enthusiast community as the Probe &quot;Wild Orchid Edition&quot;. Included on this limited appearance package was Wild Orchid exterior paint, &quot;PROBE&quot; badge on floor mats outlined in Wild Orchid, black cloth bucket seats with unique Wild Orchid inserts, and the &quot;PROBE&quot; badge on the rear outlined in Wild Orchid. This package was offered in 1994 only, and was exclusive to GT models. After dropping the Probe Feature Car after only a year of production, Ford carried over the Wild Orchid exterior color for the 1995 model year which was available on all Probe models.

In 1997, a &quot;GTS&quot; package was offered on the Probe GT. It was essentially nothing more than an appearance package, as performance was identical to the GT, but differences with the exterior were distinct. Dual racing stripes available in either white or black started at the top edge of the front bumper and continued on to the back lip of the hatch, terminating just below the center light reflector on the rear bumper. A chrome plated version of the GT&#x27;s directional &quot;swirlie&quot; wheels and a spoiler were also included in the package, as well as having a &quot;blank&quot; center reflector which lacked &quot;GT&quot; lettering as the regular GT models have. The &quot;GTS&quot; was an appearance package and not an actual model or trim level. Very few Probes were produced with the GTS package and are considered today to be extremely rare.
===Models/trim levels===
* Base • 1993–1995; 1997

===Production figures===
== Proposed third generation ==
The last Probe was built on June 20, 1997. A third-generation model, using the same platform as the Ford Contour, was under development intended for release in mid-1998 as a 1999 model. When Ford decided to discontinue the Probe, this new design became the next-generation Mercury Cougar. The name change was intended to attract younger buyers into Mercury showrooms, but this proved unsuccessful. The Escort ZX2, released shortly after the discontinuation of the Probe, was considered the Probe&#x27;s successor. In June 1998, Ford released what would have been the new Probe as the 1999 Mercury Cougar.

=== Awards ===
The Probe &quot;GT&quot; was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1993. It also made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1989, 1993, and 1994.

The NASCAR Dash Series version of a 1990 Ford Probe driven by Jeffrey Collier set a new track record at Daytona International Speedway on February 13, 1990, with a speed of 166.553 mph. That record still stands as the fastest closed course lap for a non-turbo four-cylinder powered car.

<doc id="546466" wikidata="Q15932980" url="?curid=546466" title="A361 road">
<text>The A361 is an A class road in southern England, which at is the longest three-digit A road in the UK.

==History==
When first designated in 1922, the A361 ran from Taunton (Somerset) to Banbury (Oxfordshire). It was later extended west through Bampton to South Molton (Devon), on the route of the former A398, and from South Molton to Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, previously part of the route of the A373. In 1988, when the North Devon Link Road was opened, the A361 was switched to its present route. The old route from Taunton through Bampton to South Molton was downgraded to become the B3227. In the 1970s the route was extended north from Banbury to Daventry (Northamptonshire), providing a link to the M1 motorway near Crick.

==Route==

===Devon===

The road starts in Ilfracombe as part of the town&#x27;s High Street, and is mostly single carriageway. The road passes through the villages of Knowle and Braunton, before becoming dual carriageway standard at Ashford, which continues for the short distance to Barnstaple. From there it passes the town&#x27;s railway station then merges with the A39 for a short while before splitting back off near Portmore Golf Park. The section from Barnstaple to the M5 near Tiverton has been designated the North Devon Link Road, and enables relatively fast access to the Atlantic Highway, relieving pressure on the northern section of the A39 and A358. This section is a modern, wide single carriageway trunk road (which was de-trunked in 2002), apart from the stretch between Tiverton and the M5, which is dual carriageway. Tiverton Parkway railway station is situated close to the junction with the motorway in order to give easy rail connections for people driving from north Devon. Some sections of road are on the alignment of the Devon and Somerset Railway, including the Castle Hill Viaduct over the River Bray, where the stone pillars formerly used to support a lattice girder railway bridge now support the road.

===Somerset and south Wiltshire===
The road merges with the A38 from Junction 27 of the M5 until Taunton. The rest of the road, from there to Swindon, is largely county-road class. It crosses the Somerset Levels separating Curry Moor from North Moor and Salt Moor, where in flood conditions such as the winter of 2012/2013 the Athelney spillway runs across the road if the drain level at Curry Moor pumping station exceeds 7.1m, making the road impassable. Next, it passes by the towns of Street and Glastonbury and briefly merges with the A39 again. From there it continues northeast near Cranmore (the home of the East Somerset Railway) and originally passed through Frome, which it now bypasses to the east. It briefly merges with the A36 then passes through villages at Rode and into Wiltshire at Southwick. Here it is signposted alternatively via Trowbridge or through North Bradley and Yarnbrook (which could have been reached if the Frome bypass had continued to follow the railway) to merge with the A350 before diverging towards Devizes.

===A4361===
From its junction with the A4 at Beckhampton, northwards through Avebury, the A361 has been renumbered the A4361 as it heads for Swindon town centre via Wroughton. It emerges near Stratton St Margaret, becoming the A361 again at the junction with the A419 which passes northeast of Swindon.

===North Wiltshire and Gloucestershire===
This road links Highworth to Lechlade and has no pavement for the entire length apart from a small section in Inglesham. It carries traffic at high speeds.
The Thames Path National Trail follows the verge for a little over one mile between Upper Inglesham and Inglesham. On entering Lechlade, the road crosses the Grade II listed Halfpenny Bridge, which marks the navigable limit of the River Thames for powered craft. Lines painted onto the panels on the bridge parapets indicate the border between the ceremonial counties of Wiltshire (to the south) and Gloucestershire (to the north).

===Oxfordshire===
The road crosses into Oxfordshire a few miles north of Lechlade and heads towards Cotswold Wildlife Park, Burford and Chipping Norton passing many Oxfordshire villages on its way. It is also the boundary for the Cotswolds AONB at Lechlade. It then enters Banbury from the southwest as an arterial road passing the Banbury Cross, and heading north, the A361 multiplexes on the Southam Road roundabout of the A422. For about two miles the route is signed as A422, the dual carriageway Hennef Way until Junction 11 of the M40.

===Northamptonshire===
From there it heads northeast through the villages of Wardington, Chipping Warden, Byfield, Charwelton, and Badby. A relief road for Chipping Warden was constructed in 2021, in conjunction with neighbouring works for HS2. Sections of land were purchased in the 1970s after the road was upgraded from the B4038 to the A361 to straighten out some of the sharper corners but the vast majority of these works were never done. The road then multiplexes once more, this time with the A45 just outside Daventry. Once the A45 leaves Daventry for Coventry, the remaining section of single carriageway ring road is signed as A361, before it once again turns north to Kilsby to terminate on the A5 at its northern end.

<text>The A414 is a major road in England, which connects the towns of Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire and Maldon in Essex. The road commences at the A41, at a junction west of Hemel, and travels through the town to junction 8 of the M1 motorway at Buncefield. From there, it runs parallel to the M1 until junction 7, heading south of St Albans and east through Hatfield and Hertford. The road then crosses the A10 and into Essex; it travels through Harlow, Chipping Ongar and Chelmsford, before terminating at Maldon.

==History==
The section between the M1 and the Park Street roundabout junction south of St Albans was formerly classified as the M10 motorway. This was downgraded to A road status on 1 May 2009, following the completion of the M1 widening between junctions 7 and 8 of the M1.

Between the (former) M10 Junction 1 at Park Street, and the A1 junction, the A414 is named the North Orbital Road which reflects the planners&#x27; intent to build an outer orbital road around London. The &quot;North Orbital Road&quot; route was never completed, the planners opting to build the M25 orbital motorway instead.

The A414 route has always connected Hemel Hempstead and Maldon, but over the years it has changed so much that it is almost completely new. The original route from Hemel Hempstead to St Albans followed the course of what is now the A4147, then from St Albans to Hatfield on the course of what are now the A1057 and B6426. The villages of Cole Green, Birch Green, and Staines Green were bypassed in the 1990s by a new dual carriageway that linked into the 1970s Hertingfordbury bypass. On the other side of Hertford, the A414 took what is now the A119 Ware Road, and then diverged along the course of the current B1502 and B181 from Hertford to Stanstead Abbotts. Between November 2009 and April 2011 the section between junction 7 of the M11 and Southern Way in Harlow was widened from three to four lanes and the Southern way roundabout completely remodelled.

Most of the Essex section (between the Talbot at Tylers Green and Writtle) was originally the A122. The original A414 road bypassed Harlow to the north, travelling through High Wych on what is now an unclassified road, and travelling through Sawbridgeworth to meet what is now the A1060 at Hatfield Heath, which it followed through to Chelmsford. In Chelmsford itself, the road numbers have been subject to change several times over the last three or four decades, with the A12, A130 and A414 having been rerouted many times over that period.

<doc id="546485" wikidata="Q6459091" url="?curid=546485" title="LMS Coronation Class">
<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Coronation Class is a class of express passenger steam locomotives designed by William Stanier. They were an enlarged and improved version of his previous design, the LMS Princess Royal Class, and on test were some of the most powerful steam locomotives ever used in Britain at 2,511 dbhp. The locomotives were specifically designed for power as it was intended to use them on express services between London Euston and Glasgow Central; their duties were to include the hauling of a proposed non-stop express, subsequently named the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot;. 

The first ten locomotives of the Coronation class were built in a streamlined form in 1937 by the addition of a steel streamlined casing. Five of these ten were specifically set aside to pull the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot;. Although a later batch of five unstreamlined locomotives was produced in 1938, most of the ensuing Coronation class were outshopped as streamliners. From 1944 until production ended in 1948, all-new engines were built in unstreamlined form and all the streamliners had their casings removed. The last of the 38 locomotives was completed in 1948.

The Coronation class was probably painted in more styles of livery than any other engine class; seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That does not mean that all 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific to just a few engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Locomotive Green and the entire class was turned out thus between 1955 and 1958.

It was customary on all British mainline journeys to change engines at convenient locations to avoid the lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow and they would be assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It was only in the latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.

No. 6220 &quot;Coronation&quot; held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1938, . It held that record until beaten by 4468 Mallard in 1938. Secondly, No. 6234 &quot;Duchess of Abercorn&quot; holds the record to this day for the greatest British power output to be officially recorded on an attached dynamometer car, achieved in 1939. The Coronation class was represented at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed to compare the performances of similar locomotives from the four pre-nationalised companies, but they performed extremely poorly. After this, they were targeted for low coal consumption instead of extreme pulling power . One of the class was involved in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 &quot;City of Glasgow&quot;. This was the second worst rail crash in British history, the death toll being 112.

After a successful decade of operations in the 1950s, the 1955 Modernisation Plan&#x27;s increased use of diesel locomotives made many of the class redundant, and the electrification of the main line between London Euston and Crewe resulted in their removal from this important section of the main line as there was insufficient clearance between the locomotives and the overhead wires. With no suitable work available, the survivors were scrapped from late 1962 to late 1964. Three locomotives were saved for preservation, with one of them ending up in the National Collection. As at October 2016, two are static in museums whilst the third is certified for main line service.

== Design history ==

Although the prior introduction of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, the board of directors were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot;. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.

Compared to the Princess Royal Class, there were important differences which would lead to an improved performance. Increased power was obtained by adopting a bigger boiler with greater steam-raising capacity; this included a firebox heating surface of versus 217 sq ft, a flue heating surface of versus 2,299 sq ft, superheater surface area of (some sources say 822 sq ft) versus 598 sq ft and a grate area of versus 45 sq ft. Also, the steam passages were better streamlined for greater efficiency and, most importantly, the piston valves went up in size from 8 inches to 9.5 inches. In order to allow higher speeds, the diameter of the driving wheels was increased to (from 6 ft 6 in) and the cylinder diameters were increased by . The outside cylinders were moved forward with rocking shafts operating the inside cylinders. Finally a coal pusher was incorporated into the tender so the fireman did not have to &quot;bring the coal forward&quot;, significantly cutting his workload which was particularly important on the long runs from Euston to Glasgow.

Just as the new design was approaching finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a difficult problem. The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had captured the imagination of the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS&#x27;s new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer&#x27;s maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.

The casing was tested in a wind tunnel, and retained after it was found to be as good as other forms of streamlining. After introduction it was subsequently found that its aerodynamic form failed to disturb the air sufficiently to lift the exhaust from the chimney, thus obstructing the driver&#x27;s vision with smoke.

== Construction history ==

=== Locomotives ===
The first five locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, were built in 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an average cost of £11,641 each. They were all intended to haul the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot;, so the locomotives and the special trainsets bore a common livery. The locomotives were streamlined and painted Caledonian Railway blue with silver horizontal lines along each side of the locomotive. The special trainsets that they hauled were painted the same shade of blue and the silver lining was repeated along each side of the coaches.

In 1938 the second five locomotives of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form at an average cost of £11,323 each. They were painted in the same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal lining that had been a feature of the first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt lining along the sides of these coaches. A prototype trainset was built with such lining for exhibition in America, but it was never put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.

Stanier, the designer of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining was too high a price to pay for the actual benefits gained at high speed. Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.

During 1939 and 1940, a fourth batch of ten locomotives (Nos. 6235–6244) was built in streamlined form commencing with No. 6235 &quot;City of Birmingham&quot;. The names of cities for the locomotives would seem to have been adopted because the LMS was fast running out of names of Duchesses. These locomotives cost an average of £10,659 for the first five and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict alphabetical order. This came to an end when No. 6244 &quot;City of Leeds&quot; was patriotically renamed &quot;King George VI&quot; in 1941.

The fifth batch, again named after cities, comprised four locomotives, Nos. 6245–6248. These engines were built during 1943 and the average cost was held to £10,908 due to the incorporation of recycled boilers. During the Second World War, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs for steel between civilian departments and the War Department when allocating those resources. Despite these constraints, the entire batch was still outshopped in streamlined form.

The theme of cities continued into 1944 when another batch of four, Nos. 6249–6252, was built without streamlining. The cost of these locomotives averaged £11,664 each. A follow-up batch of three locomotives (Nos. 6253–6255) was built in 1946 and this batch attracted an inflationary average cost of £15,460 each. The problem of hanging smoke was addressed and smoke deflectors were now incorporated into the design.

The final two locomotives were constructed to the modified design of George Ivatt who succeeded both Stanier, following his retirement, and Stanier&#x27;s immediate successor Charles Fairburn, who unexpectedly died in office. The first, No. 6256 built in 1947, was the last of the class to be built before nationalisation and it was therefore named in honour of its original designer &quot;Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S.&quot;. The unveiling of the nameplate was performed by Stanier himself. In 1948, the privately owned railways were nationalised and incorporated into British Railways. It was within this new regime that No. 46257 was completed – in common with other LMS locomotives, 40000 had been added to the original numbers. The spiralling costs after the Second World War, combined with the design changes, resulted in the individual cost of these locomotives escalating to £21,411.

=== Tenders ===

==== Overview ====
The original design of tender, which came to be known as Type &#x27;A&#x27; was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.

A second, more traditional design followed for the initial batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type &#x27;B&#x27; tenders were distinguishable from Type &#x27;A&#x27; by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.

The third design, by George Ivatt, initially was Type &#x27;C1&#x27; and it was paired with the three locomotives Nos. 6253–6255. It was partially riveted and resembled a Type &#x27;A&#x27; at its front end and a Type &#x27;B&#x27; at the rear. The design was quickly followed by Type &#x27;C2&#x27;, which differed from the &#x27;C1&#x27; in that it had a lower front edge and was fitted with Timken roller bearings. Only two &#x27;C2&#x27;s were built and they were coupled to the last two of the class, Nos. 6256 and 46257.

Whilst nearly fifteen of the tenders remained wedded to their original locomotives, others received new partners – the very first tender to be manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, it was difficult to spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type &#x27;A&#x27; streamlined tenders were married to unstreamlined locomotives.

An unusual feature of all Coronation Class tenders was that they were fitted with a steam-operated coal pusher to bring the coal down to the firing plate. When this was in operation a plume of steam could be seen rising from the rear face of the coal bunker backwall. This equipment greatly helped the locomotive&#x27;s fireman to meet the high demands for power during the non-stop run of between London Euston and Glasgow Central, when operating the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot; train.

==== Table of tender and locomotive pairings ====
All LMS tenders were given their own unique identity numbers and they tended to be constructed in advance of the locomotives they would be paired with. Hence, they were made in four batches, Nos. 9703–9709, 9743–9752, 9798–9817 and 10622-10624.

The following table lists the locomotives to which they were attached. Of note is the fact that locomotive No. 46221 had its tender (No.9816) withdrawn ahead of time in 1962; the locomotive was then paired to the Princess Royal tender No. 9359 until its withdrawal in May 1963.
=== Modifications ===

==== Double chimneys ====
Single chimneys were fitted to Nos. 6220–6234 when built. Following a successful trial using No. 6234 &quot;Duchess of Abercorn&quot; on 26 February 1939, these were replaced with double blastpipes and chimneys between 1939 and 1944, the last being No. 6220 &quot;Coronation&quot;. From No. 6235 onwards, all the locomotives were built with double blastpipes and chimneys. 

==== Smoke deflectors ====
Following a report by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke deflectors were introduced due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew&#x27;s forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors from the outset was No. 6253 &quot;City of St. Albans&quot; in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 &quot;Duchess of Montrose&quot; in February 1945.

==== Removal of streamlining ====
George Ivatt&#x27;s 1945 report also recommended the removal of all streamlining casings and they were removed from the fitted locomotives from 1946 onwards. It had been found to be of little value at speeds below , and was unpopular with running shed employees as it caused difficulty of access for maintenance. The first step towards de-streamlining was carried out during the Second World War when many of the streamlined tenders had their side sheets cut away at the rear of the tender. Many photographs exist showing this measure. The removal of the streamlining proper commenced in April 1946 with No. 6235 &quot;City of Birmingham&quot;. All de-streamlining coincided with the fitting of smoke deflectors. No. 6243 &quot;City of Lancaster&quot; was renumbered as 46243 in April 1948 and, as it was not de-streamlined until May 1949, it became the only locomotive to carry its British Railways number while streamlined.

Initially, locomotives that had previously been streamlined could be readily recognised by the sloping top to the front of their smokeboxes, as well as slightly smaller front-facing cab windows. In due course all were re-equipped with cylindrical smokeboxes and larger cab windows, often, but not necessarily, at the same time.The first locomotive to receive a cylindrical smokebox was No. 6226 &quot;Duchess of Norfolk&quot; in October 1952. The last one to retain the sloping top was 46246 &quot;City of Manchester&quot; which appeared with its new smokebox in May 1960.

Even following the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, it was still possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards at right angles to connect with the buffer beam in the style of the Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 &quot;City of Glasgow&quot; which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.

==== The final locomotives ====
The final two locomotives Nos. 6256 and 46257 &quot;Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S&quot; and &quot;City of Salford&quot; were given many new features. In order to raise the mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides through the use of roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.

==== Automatic warning system ====
During the twentieth century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were increasingly perceived as a significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal was accompanied by a ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted &quot;clear&quot;, an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a warning horn. In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.

In 1952, the UK&#x27;s most disastrous SPAD ever occurred at Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 &quot;City of Glasgow&quot; was severely damaged. The lack of an ATC system on most of Britain&#x27;s railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately in front of the cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.

== Table of Locomotives ==
The following table lists the chronology of major events for the entire class. De-streamlining took several weeks, so the date for modifications has been taken as the date when the locomotive was returned to service. Entries listed as &quot;Current&quot; are valid as at December 2016.
== Liveries ==

=== The LMS era ===

==== Pre-1942 ====
Before applying the top coats of paint, the LMS would apply a matt undercoat of shop grey. The first non-streamlined loco was fitted with mock-up nameplates and numbers for each of the first batch of locos which was then photographed to mimic each individual loco. Those temporary nameplates are now in the NRM&#x27;s collection in York. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned &#x27;speed whiskers&#x27; comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.

The first five locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, were painted in Caledonian blue with banding in silver-coloured aluminium paint. Wheels, lining to the edges of the bands, and the background to the chromium-plated nameplates were painted in a darker blue, Navy or Prussian blue.

The second and fourth batches of streamlined locomotives, Nos. 6225–6229 and 6235–6244, were painted in crimson lake, with banding in gold lined with vermilion and black. Nameplates had a black background. LMS shop grey was carried briefly in service on No. 6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot; from 7 September 1938 until its return to Crewe Works later that year. It was then painted crimson lake and disguised as No. 6220, in preparation for the 1939 visit to the New York World&#x27;s Fair. Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and crimson lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded sans-serif.

The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 were painted in a special version of the standard crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines. Serif lettering and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were chrome-plated, as were the nameplates, which had a black background.

Two unusual events have been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No. 6221 &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; had its Caledonian blue colour scheme replaced by the crimson lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that at some time in the two-year history of the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot; a crimson streamliner might have hauled the blue trainset. Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.

==== Post-1942 ====
Black was the overriding colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals on all these locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.

The one exception to black was No. 6234 &quot;Duchess of Abercorn&quot; which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted on one side of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.

==== Table of LMS liveries ====
The following table lists the liveries carried by the Coronation class between June 1937 and December 1947. The blue-grey livery has never been authenticated in a colour photograph.

=== The British Railways era ===

==== Pre-1951 ====
Early in 1948, before the new liveries for the whole of British Railways had been decided upon, Nos. 46229, 46232 and 46236 were repainted LMS-style lined black (crimson and straw lining) and No. 46257 was similarly turned out when constructed in July. Throughout 1948 and 1949 the English locomotives (now under the control of the London Midland Region of British Railways) were relined in an experimental BR lined black, which used LNWR-style red, cream and grey lining (similar to that adopted for Mixed Traffic locos), and &#x27;BRITISH RAILWAYS&#x27; in Gill Sans on the tender.
The Scottish locomotives based at Glasgow&#x27;s Polmadie shed, which were under the control of the Scottish Region, were destined for a brighter future. Commencing in May 1948, seven of the class were called in to be painted in &quot;experimental blue&quot;. This livery was a somewhat darker shade than that adopted as the standard express livery the following year, being more similar to the former GER blue, and lined out in the LNWR style lining with &#x27;BRITISH RAILWAYS&#x27; in Gill Sans on the tender. So sudden was the adoption of this blue livery that No. 46232, fresh in LMS-style lined black following its heavy general repair, was called back after a mere four days to be repainted blue. Around this time BR was also experimenting with various shades of green on the other regions.

The Polmadie experiment was upheld by British Railways in 1949 when the somewhat brighter BR standard blue was selected for all its large passenger locomotives, despite the fact that the Great Western Railway (GWR), the Southern Railway (SR) and the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) had overwhelmingly painted their locomotives green (the LMS by contrast concentrating on crimson lake). Blue was subsequently carried by 27 of the 38 Coronation Class locomotives. The first two to be so painted, Nos. 46242 and 46243 were outshopped in the new colour when they received their heavy general repairs in May 1949. The blue livery, which was subsequently phased out, lasted until September 1955.

British Railways undertook a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives with their new BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies&#x27; logos, emblems and even coats of arms, to be replaced by the stark lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.

Subsequently, in 1949 a crest was designed to replace the spartan logo. In turn, this would be replaced in 1956 by yet another design of crest.

==== Post-1951 ====

The decision to adopt blue as the standard colour was subsequently reversed and Locomotive green was introduced in November 1951 with No. 46232 &quot;Duchess of Montrose&quot;. Between October 1955 and December 1957, all 38 locomotives carried it concurrently, the only livery the entire class carried.

In the late 1950s the decision was made that the London Midland Region&#x27;s main line locomotives could carry the colour maroon. This permission did not extend to the Scottish Region whose locomotives remained green until withdrawal.

The LMR maroon was carried on 16 locomotives from the late 1950s: Nos. 46225-6, 46228-9, 46236, 46238, 46240, 46243-48, 46251, 46254 and 46256. No. 46245 was the first, in December 1957; a further fifteen examples followed between May and November 1958. The style of lining varied: the first six repaints into maroon (including No. 46245) were lined out in the LMS style; the last ten received the BR style of lining as used on the standard green livery; No. 46247, originally lined in the LMS style, was given the BR style in July 1959; and by November 1961 those with the BR lining were repainted to match No. 46245.

Because of insufficient clearance between the locomotives and the 25 kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, the whole class was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate on the line for which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.

==== Table of BR liveries ====
The table below lists the various liveries applied to the locomotives from 1 January 1948. Repaints in the same livery are not included.

== Shed allocations ==

=== Overview ===
Initially all the locomotives were allocated to Camden shed in London (LMS designation 1B). By 1939 there were nineteen officially stationed there. This came to an abrupt end when war was declared in September of that year, as the Government had decreed that in such an event all Britain&#x27;s largest locomotives would be mothballed for the duration. Consequently, seven of the class were immediately dispatched to either Holyhead or to Rugby (via Manchester Longsight). Within weeks the stupidity of this policy was realised and the locomotives were returned to service. 

In 1940 some of the class were reallocated to Crewe North (5A) and Glasgow Polmadie (27A, 66A from 1950). As the numbers grew, Crewe North was generally the beneficiary, but in 1946 Carlisle Upperby (12B, 12A from 1958), received an initial allocation of six locomotives. At various times locomotives were also seconded to Liverpool Edge Hill (8A). A typical allocation of the 1950s was Camden 15, Crewe North 10, Polmadie 9 and Upperby 4.

During the 1960s the installation of overhead electrification commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised electrification between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the &quot;Coronation Class&quot; resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden&#x27;s allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie&#x27;s was dispensed with entirely. The bulk of the class was situated at either Crewe North or Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) now being used in addition to Upperby.

=== Table of shed allocations ===
The entire class saw service at the following sheds. The table lists the recorded allocations, but many temporary loans are not recorded – throughout the working life of the class, these may have been considerable. It also ignores the participation of No. 46236 in the Locomotive Exchange Trials of 1948, the transfer of No. 46225 to the Rugby Test Station for several months in 1955 and the secondment of Nos. 46237, 46254 and 46257 to the Western Region in 1955 and 1956.

There were wide variations in these histories. Six of the 1937–38 batches led a quiet life, being situated at Polmadie for the whole of their lives, apart from their initial spell at Camden. Others were moved from shed to shed for most of their lives, Nos. 6228, 6251 and 6252 being particularly well travelled.

== Records ==
=== British speed record ===
Between 1937 and 1939, two significant records were set by locomotives of the Coronation class. Before the introduction of the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot; service, No. 6220 &quot;Coronation&quot; headed a special train of invited guests from London Euston to Crewe on 29 June 1937. After a fast but uneventful run the engine was accelerated up to high speed. Just south of Crewe, the train (disputably) achieved a speed of , narrowly beating the previous British record for a steam locomotive (held by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER)). The brakes were applied far too late at such a speed and the result was that the train entered a series of crossover points at Crewe much too fast. Fortunately, Stanier had designed an inherently stable locomotive and both &quot;Coronation&quot; and its following train held the rails, although most of the crockery in the dining car was smashed, much to the consternation of the assembled guests In contrast to the LNER&#x27;s record-breaking effort the previous year, when A4 Class No. 2512 had suffered severe damage when the centre cylinder&#x27;s big end bearing failed, No.6220 was undamaged and was driven back to London the same day at an average speed of , maintaining over 100 mph for several miles. The LNER was to regain its ascendancy on 3 July 1938 when A4 Class No. 4468, &quot;Mallard&quot; regained the British and world records with a recorded maximum speed of .

=== British power record ===
Following an earlier test using No. 6234 &quot;Duchess of Abercorn&quot; which indicated that the locomotive&#x27;s power was compromised by its single blastpipe, a double blastpipe and chimney were installed. On 26 February 1939, a retest was undertaken and No. 6234 hauled a train of 20 coaches, including a dynamometer car, from Crewe to Glasgow and back. Even though the load was , the train was hauled up the climbs to the summits at Shap and Beattock at unprecedented speeds. Drawbar horsepower, representing the power conveyed directly to the 20 coach train, was frequently over and a maximum of was recorded. This remains the official British record for a steam locomotive to this day. Because there were unmeasured variables, the horsepower at the cylinders could only be estimated; Cecil J. Allen thought it to be whilst O. S. Nock was more conservative at . This sustained power output could not be expected on day-to-day service as it was beyond the shovelling capacity of a single fireman, and two firemen were carried for this test run.

Some seventeen years later, No. 46225 &quot;Duchess of Gloucester&quot;, a virtually identical sister engine, was tested by British Railways on the open road on the Settle and Carlisle line. Again it was established that a continuous drawbar horsepower of was readily sustainable. Strangely, the drawbar power output on the stationary test plant at Rugby could only be coaxed up to an absolute maximum of which in retrospect casts doubt on the validity of the methodology.

== 1948 locomotive exchange trials ==
In May 1948 the BR Executive arranged a series of locomotive exchanges whereby each of the &quot;Big Four&quot; previously independent companies would submit its various locomotives for evaluation. It was intended that each locomotive would be tested not only on its own home territory, but on the tracks of its three other &quot;rivals&quot;. The aim was to ascertain the best qualities of the competing locomotives in order to help design future locomotives. In that dynamometer cars were to accompany the test trains, whilst coal consumption was to be accurately measured, it was unclear whether the aim was to test the locomotives for power or for efficiency – the two are somewhat incompatible.

The locomotive classes were all pre-chosen by BR, but the various regions were free to choose, within certain parameters, which specific locomotives were to be represented. Tasked with supplying a suitable Coronation, the London Midland Region (LMR) selected No. 46236 &quot;City of Bradford&quot;. Regions were also free to choose their drivers. To drive the engine throughout, the LMR chose driver Byford from Camden shed who was seen to be sufficiently experienced. &quot;City of Bradford&quot; was then tested on its home ground between London Euston and Carlisle, on the Eastern Region (ER) between London Kings Cross and Leeds, on the Western Region (WR) between London Paddington and Plymouth, then finally on the Southern Region (SR) between London Waterloo and Exeter.

The results showed that, compared with its peer locomotives, &quot;City of Bradford&#x27;s&quot; coal consumption was the second lowest (and well below the third lowest), but its power output was well below any of its peers. In later years some insight has emerged concerning No. 46236&#x27;s outings. On the WR, having arrived at Plymouth from Paddington, the dynamometer crew were amazed that such a large locomotive had consumed so little coal; on the undulating tracks of the SR west of Salisbury, it was alleged that coal consumption was held down by running gently uphill then racing downhill without any attempt to follow the timetable passing times. Additionally, a photograph of the locomotive leaving Kings Cross, bound for Leeds on the ER, shows the locomotive with so little coal on board that none could be seen even from a somewhat elevated vantage point. In other publications, driver Byford has been heavily criticised for his lacklustre driving. Certainly, Byford was so obsessed with minimising coal consumption that he never attempted to demonstrate any other facet of performance, but when coal consumption was being so accurately measured it was a reasonable assumption to draw that coal efficiency was the predominant requirement. Many years later, there was a degree of exoneration for driver Byford when the whole procedure was described as &quot;the most inconsequential and unrepresentative series of competitive trials ever to be held on the railways of Great Britain&quot;.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*On 21 July 1945, locomotive No. 6231 &quot;Duchess of Atholl&quot; was hauling an express passenger train which overran signals and collided with a freight train that was being shunted at , Dumfriesshire. Two people were killed and three were injured.
*On 21 July 1947, locomotive No. 6244 &quot;King George VI&quot; was derailed at near Polesworth, Warwickshire due to the poor state of the track following the years of neglect throughout the Second World War. Coaches piled up behind it and five passengers were killed and 64 injured. 
*On 19 November 1951 No. 46252 &quot;City of Leicester&quot;, whilst traversing from the fast line to the slow, was derailed at almost the same spot. This time there was no pile-up and no serious injury.
*On 17 April 1948, locomotive No. 6251 &quot;City of Nottingham&quot; was hauling a mail train which was in a rear-end collision with a passenger train at Winsford, Cheshire. In the first major accident for the newly formed British Railways, 24 people were killed and thirty injured.
*On 25 April 1949, locomotive No. 46230 &quot;Duchess of Buccleuch&quot; was hauling a passenger train that overran a signal and was derailed at Douglas Park Signal Box, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. The signalman was suspected of having deliberately moved points under the train.
*On 8 October 1952, locomotive No. 46242 &quot;City of Glasgow&quot; was hauling an express passenger train when it overran signals and crashed into a local passenger train at , Middlesex. Another express passenger train ran into the wreckage. In the second deadliest railway accident in the United Kingdom, 112 people were killed; 102 at the scene and 10 more died later from their injuries; no fewer than 340 people were injured.
*On 3 February 1954, locomotive No. 46250 &quot;City of Lichfield&quot; was hauling a passenger train that was derailed inside Watford Tunnel, Hertfordshire due to a broken rail. The rear three carriages became divided from the train at station, with one of them ending up on the platform. Fifteen people were injured.

There were three instances of firebox crown collapse, resulting in boiler explosions. No. 6224 &quot;Princess Alexandra&quot; suffered a severe failure at Craigenhill on 10 September 1940 due to the inexperience of the crew (who both perished). The same locomotive suffered a similar failure on 7 March 1948 at Lamington due to dirty and malfunctioning water gauge glasses. The third incident occurred as No. 46238 &quot;City of Carlisle&quot; was passing Bletchley on 24 January 1962 – this was attributed to faulty design of the water gauge glasses.

== Withdrawals ==

=== Overview ===
The London Midland Region, compared with some of the other Regions, was slow to discard its &quot;Big Engines&quot;. By a matter of a few days, the Western Region had managed to withdraw the whole of its King Class locomotives before the Coronation Class lost its first. The beginning of the end occurred late in December 1962 when it was deemed uneconomic to proceed with major repairs required by three locomotives. Nos. 46227, 46231 and 46232 were therefore summarily withdrawn.

Nos. 46234, 46246 and 46253 followed the next month and throughout 1963 the entire initial batch, Nos. 46220-46224, was withdrawn along with Nos. 46230, 46242, 46247, 46249 and 46252. These withdrawals meant that by the New Year of 1964, there were only 22 of the class remaining. Nos. 46229, 46233 and 46236 followed in early 1964, although two of this group – No. 46229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot; and No. 46233 &quot;Duchess of Sutherland&quot; – were destined for preservation.

Attempts were now made to find a role for the remaining 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely because it would be excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.

Accordingly, the remaining locomotives were nominally taken out of service on 12 September 1964 apart from No. 46256 &quot;Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S&quot; which hauled a special train on 26 September 1964. By October all were officially withdrawn. Up until March 1964 all the withdrawn Coronation class locomotives were cut up for scrap at Crewe Works, but the simultaneous withdrawal of all nineteen remaining locomotives in the autumn of 1964 (one of which was preserved) was too much to deal with and the work was contracted out to private firms. J. Cashmore at Great Bridge, Staffordshire, accounted for nine of the batch, the West of Scotland Shipbreaking Company at Troon, Ayrshire, dispatched eight and the Central Wagon Company at Wigan, Lancashire, disposed of the one remaining.

The following table lists the fate of the Coronation Class locomotives following their withdrawal from service.
== Preservation ==

=== Histories of the three preserved locomotives ===
Of the 38 original members of the Coronation Class, only three locomotives have been preserved, albeit in very different ways. Two of the three preserved engines have even run on the mainline in preservation, these being 46229 &amp; 46233. As of 2019, only 6233 is operational and has a valid main line certificate.

One member, No. 46243 City of Lancaster was the subject of an unsuccessful preservation attempt by Peter Beet.

Current numbers indicated in bold.

==== No. 46229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot; ====


Following its withdrawal in February 1964, no. 46229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot; was purchased by the holiday camp giant Butlin&#x27;s, and put on display at their Minehead site. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to Minehead&#x27;s salty atmosphere, and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin&#x27;s signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum&#x27;s York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.

In April 1980 the locomotive again took to the rails and thereafter was employed in hauling many enthusiasts&#x27; trains. After a substantial overhaul, the Duchess was declared fit in 1990 to continue working on the national network and at the same time the museum purchased it outright from Butlins. In 1998, however, the locomotive returned to static display at the National Railway Museum in York.

Following a successful appeal run by &quot;Steam Railway&quot; magazine, it was decided to re-streamline No. 46229. The locomotive was moved to Tyseley Locomotive Works, for the work to be carried out. The project was completed in 2009, and the locomotive returned to York in May, now wearing its crimson streamlining and pre-war number 6229.

==== No. 46233 &quot;Duchess of Sutherland&quot; ====


No. 46233, which was withdrawn at the same time as No. 46229, was also purchased by Butlin&#x27;s and it was displayed at its holiday camp at Ayr, although – like No. 6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot; at Minehead – it was stripped of its smoke deflectors and painted in pseudo-LMS livery. By 1971 it had similarly deteriorated due to the salty seaside air and was in need of expensive maintenance. It was rescued by Alan Bloom, owner of Norfolk-based &quot;Bloom&#x27;s of Bressingham&quot; nurseries; he had already taken over the Royal Scot Class No. 6100 from Butlin&#x27;s Skegness holiday camp. In March 1971 No. 46233 was taken by rail and road to Bressingham on permanent loan.

Over the course of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 restoring the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was not prepared to spend further money at this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.

In 1989 Bloom bought the locomotive outright. During 1993 it was moved temporarily to the East Lancashire Railway at Bury near Manchester and whilst there an exercise was undertaken to establish what repairs were necessary and how much they would cost. It was found that the extensive list amounted to £162,000 and no business plan could be found that would support such expenditure.

In November 1995 the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust purchased the locomotive for £200,000 (through a third party) and the following February it was transferred to the Trust&#x27;s premises at the Midland Railway in Butterley, Derbyshire. In 1998, funded by public donation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the third party purchaser was paid off and the money was now available to restore the locomotive. The work was carried out at the railway workshops at Swanwick Junction and in July 2001 the restored locomotive was allowed a trial run on the national rail network, where it promptly broke down and had to be towed home. With the fault fixed, No. 46233 now started to generate income by hauling enthusiasts&#x27; trains, as well as the Royal Train on two occasions. Following another overhaul commencing in 2010, the locomotive resumed its steaming duties in 2012 this time wearing BR Lined Green with the early BR crest. This livery being chosen following a vote run by the PRCLT for what the engine would wear after its overhaul. It had originally been intended that 46233 would wear BR green for a year after returning to steam in 2012 before returning to its LMS Crimson lake identity a year later, it would however stay in its BR identity for an additional five years until the end of 2017. In early 2017 it had its early BR emblem replaced with the later crest and on its cabside it had the yellow cabside stripe applied, (in BR days the stripe was applied to locos which were not permitted to run under the overhead wires south of Crewe). During repairs which were undertaken at Butterley in 2018 the engine was repainted into its LMS crimson lake identity with its four digit LMS number. To date 6233 is still owned by the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and still pulling enthusiasts&#x27; specials.

==== No. 46235 &quot;City of Birmingham&quot; ====

The locomotive&#x27;s official naming ceremony took place in March 1945, when it was well over five years old. Alderman Wiggins-Davies performed the ceremony at the back end of Birmingham New Street station as the locomotive was too large to be accommodated within the main part of the station.

The city&#x27;s love for its eponymous locomotive was borne out when, in 1953, Birmingham&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry determined that when the opportunity arose it would like to acquire No. 46235. The museum eventually made its purchase in October 1964, when the locomotive was withdrawn. After successive spells at Crewe Works, Nuneaton, Crewe again (for cosmetic overhaul), Saltley depot and the Birmingham Lawley Street container terminal, the locomotive was finally moved to the museum in May 1966. At that time the building was still under construction, being finally completed in 1972.

In 1997 Birmingham City Council decided to close the museum and to construct the brand new ThinkTank museum (since re-christened Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum) in nearby Digbeth. In 2001 the locomotive was moved to the Thinktank where it remains as at September 2017. It differs significantly from the other two preserved locomotives in that it represents the only untouched example of a British Railways Coronation class locomotive.

== Models ==

The class has been extensively modelled by a broad range of manufacturers in both ready-to-run models and kit forms.

Hornby developed the first model of the class in OO gauge for their Dublo range in 1948, representing 6231 &#x27;Duchess of Atholl&#x27;. It was modelled with a heavy diecast &#x27;Mazak&#x27; body and chassis with tin-plate tender, and finished in LMS Crimson Lake livery; motive power was via a 12v DC electric motor for Hornby&#x27;s 3-rail track system. In 1953, smoke deflectors were added to the model, which was reliveried in BR Loco Dark Green and released as 46232 ‘Duchess of Montrose’. In 1959, the model was comprehensively retooled and released in both 3-rail and (for the first time) 2-rail versions as 46247 ‘City of Liverpool’ and 46245 ‘City of London’ respectively in BR Maroon livery with LMS-style lining. These locomotives had split footplates representing the de-streamlined versions of the locomotives, albeit with the full cylindrical smokeboxes of the later rebuilds.

After the collapse of the Meccano Ltd empire, Wrenn acquired Hornby&#x27;s Dublo tooling and continued to produce a variety of locomotives of the class in various liveries using the &#x27;City&#x27; body from 1969 until the early 1990s.

In 1970, Triang-Hornby produced a OO gauge model of the streamlined locomotives which utilised the tender base of the old Hornby Dublo model with a new polystyrene plastic body and a new Tri-ang chassis.

Hornby Railways have continued to release many incarnations of the class in both streamlined and conventional forms up to the present day.

Whitemetal and brass kits have been produced by various manufacturers including Keyser, Jamieson, Anchoridge and DJH, who have offered streamlined and conventional outlines in a variety of gauges.

<doc id="546492" wikidata="Q822665" url="?curid=546492" title="Citroën C5">
<text>The Citroën C5 is a large family car produced by the French manufacturer Citroën between 2000 and 2018 in France, and between 2008 and 2022 in China, over two generations. It replaced the Citroën Xantia, in the large family car class, and is the first modern Citroën with &quot;Cx&quot; naming nomenclature, previously used by its ancestors, the C4 and C6 from 1930. A crossover, unrelated to the previous generations, was released in 2021, with crossover styling and marketed as the Citroën C5 X.

== First generation (DC/DE; 2001)==

The first-generation C5 was available as a five-door liftback or five-door estate styles only. As a liftback, Citroën had completely reversed the design philosophy from the fastback saloon era of Robert Opron. Production commenced in the end of 2000. Sales in the United Kingdom commenced in April 2001.

Power came from 1.8 and 2.0 litre straight-4 and 3.0 litre V6 petrol engines, as well as 1.6, 2.0 and 2.2 litre direct injection diesel engines. The first-generation C5 was the last Citroën developed under the chairmanship of Jacques Calvet (1982–1999). The C5 had a further development of Citroën&#x27;s hydropneumatic suspension, now called Hydractive 3.

The major change with this system was the use of electronic sensors to replace the mechanical height correctors seen in all previous hydropneumatic cars. This allowed the suspension computer to automatically control ride height: at high speed the suspension is lowered to reduce drag and at low speeds on bumpy roads the ride height is raised.

Manual control of ride height was retained, though it was overridden by the computer if the car was driven at an inappropriate speed for the selected height. Certain cars also featured the computer controlled ride stiffness, called Hydractive 3+.

In a major break with Citroën tradition, the brakes and steering were no longer powered by the same hydraulic system as the suspension, but the power steering used the same LDS fluid with its own pump. It has been speculated that the primary driver for this was the cost of developing electronic brake force distribution for the system, when the PSA Group already had an implementation for conventional brakes.

Another factor may be the highly responsive nature of &#x27;traditional&#x27; Citroën brakes, which some have found hard to adjust to on other hydropneumatic cars, though it is felt by some to be superior.

In September 2004, the C5 underwent a major facelift (new front and rear ends; same centre section) to bring it into line with the look of the new Citroën C4. The liftback was lengthened from to and the estate from to . Also, this new version got swivelling directional headlights.

The Hydractive suspension improves ride quality, keeps the car levelled, and enables the car to drive on three wheels if one tire is flat. The suspension is derived from the Hydropneumatic suspension used in the 1950s Citroën DS. Variations in height using the Hydractive suspension range up to in the front and in the back.

Production ended in December 2007, with the final production number being 720,000. In the United Kingdom, 45,502 models of the car were sold from 2001 to 2004.


== Second generation (RD/TD; 2007)==
The second-generation C5 was officially unveiled in the beginning of 2008, and does not retain the liftback bodystyle, instead being a regular, three box saloon of an aerodynamic shape.

The C5 Airscape concept, which was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2007, gave an outlook on the second-generation C5.

It was launched in February 2008, with the estate version following in May 2008, and receives the name of Tourer. This C5 won 2009 Semperit Irish Car of the Year, as well as being awarded 2008–09 Japan&#x27;s Import Car of the Year. The second generation was presented on 15 January 2008, having its world premiere at the Brussels Motor Show.

The second-generation C5 is available with conventional springs, as well as the hydropneumatic suspension and 2.7L Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17 engine from the Citroën C6. In 2009, the 2.7L was replaced by an updated 3.0L unit which, despite offering more power, has improved fuel consumption and emissions.

In 2010, the 2.0L HDi 140 and the 2.2L HDi 173 engines, were replaced by the 2.0L HDi 160 engine, mated to a six speed automatic or manual transmissions to comply with the Euro 5. Similarly, the 2.0L 16V 143 bhp petrol engine was replaced by the 1.6L THP 155, from the DS3 mated to a six speed manual transmission.

In 2011, the C5 was given a mild facelift, with a few cosmetic changes, such as LED lights. Three engines were added to the range consisting of two diesels, 2.0 HDI 160, and a 2.2 HDI 200 as well as a petrol engine, 1.6 VTI 120.

In July 2012, the C5 was given another mild facelift, with a few cosmetic changes, such as softer chevron badging, modified badging of C5, softer chevron &quot;grille&quot; as per the recently updated C4, and exclusive badges (on the Exclusive) on the sides in front of the front doors. For the Exclusive, the onboard GPS/radio head was also changed to the eMyWay unit which features full Bluetooth connectivity and iPod/USB interface.

In May 2016, the C5 was officially withdrawn in the United Kingdom, due to disappointing sales of 17,105 since 2008. In 2015, only 237 cars were sold, the lowest number since the car&#x27;s launch. This is in comparison to 6,549 sales in France in the same time span. However, this could be due to the model being launched at the start of the financial crisis in 2008, as well as increased demand for crossover models. This also marked the end of right-hand drive production of the C5.

Sharing the same underpinnings of the Citroën C6, which has since been discontinued, this generation of C5 is often referred to also as the &quot;X7&quot;. It is observed that on these cars two technical entities, the hydropneumatic system and the double wishbone layout, are utilized in conjunction.

eTouch
Comprising a package of services including the emergency and assistance calls, Citroën eTouch also proposes a virtual maintenance manual, and an Eco Driving service accessible via the MyCitroën personal area on the web. For calls, Citroën eTouch works completely independently.

The system is equipped with a GPS module, and a SIM card, with no need for a call plan and unlimited over time. The vehicles features two buttons, &quot;SOS&quot; for emergency calls (the call is also triggered automatically in the event of impact) and &quot;Double Chevron&quot; for assistance calls.

The emergency call gets emergency services to customers faster, for accident victims and bystanders alike. The two services are free and available at any time. In China, the C5 was heavily restyled in 2017, while in Europe, production officially ended. Since March 2017, the saloon became no longer free to order. However, the Tourer and the CrossTourer remained configurable.

===2017 facelift in China===
The 2017 facelift for the second-generation C5 in China includes a redesign with the front end of the car completely redesigned, featuring new headlights, grilles, and bumper, and giving it an updated front face, and a slightly revised rear with new tail lamps. The 2017 facelift C5 model was powered by the same range of engines used in the pre-facelift model in China. Engine options include a 1.6-liter turbo gasoline engine with 167 horsepower (124 kilowatts) and a bigger 1.8 turbo engine with 204 hp (152 kW) and 207 pound-feet (280 Newton meters) of torque. Both motors will be mated exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission, powering to the front wheels. The Hydractive hydropneumatic suspension won’t be available for the 2017 C5 facelift as Citroën has decided to drop it from its portfolio due to the high production costs and low customer demand.

==Successor==
The new C5 X was revealed in the United Kingdom in July 2022. It will be sold in various markets, such as Australia and Europe. It uses the C5 nameplate, but is now a larger mid-size crossover SUV.

<text>RTÉ Radio 1 () is an Irish national radio station owned and operated by RTÉ and is the direct descendant of Dublin radio station 2RN, which began broadcasting on a regular basis on 1 January 1926.

The total budget for the station in 2010 was €18.4 million. It is the most-listened-to radio station in Ireland.

==History==
The Department of Posts and Telegraphs opened 2RN, the first Irish radio station, on 1 January 1926. Station 6CK, a Cork relay of 2RN, joined the Dublin station in 1927, and a high-power transmitter at Athlone in County Westmeath opened in 1932. From the latter date the three stations became known as Radio Athlone, later being renamed Radio Éireann (&quot;Irish Radio&quot;/&quot;Radio of Ireland&quot;) in 1937.

Like most small European broadcasters at that time Radio Éireann had only been assigned a single high-power frequency (meaning only one channel could be broadcast), and had limited programming hours due to financial constraints. Until after the Second World War Radio Éireann was only able to afford to broadcast in the evenings with the exception of a programme of records in the afternoon. It broadcast a mixed schedule of light entertainment and serious drama, Irish language programming, and talks. Radio Éireann also carried sponsored programmes, often produced by Leonard Plugge&#x27;s International Broadcasting Company, which tended to be more popular than programming made directly by Radio Éireann itself.

Operated as part of the civil service until 1960, the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 transferred the station to a statutory corporation, also called Radio Éireann, in preparation for the launch of its sister television station. The name of the corporation was changed to Radio Telefís Éireann in 1966. As a consequence, the station was renamed RTÉ Radio. The station also began FM transmission in 1966. In 1971 the station began the phased move from the GPO on O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin city centre, to a new purpose-built Radio Centre at Donnybrook, with the last broadcast from the GPO on 8 November 1976. When, in 1979, RTÉ established a new rock and pop station under the name of RTÉ Radio 2 (now RTÉ 2fm), the original RTÉ Radio station was renamed RTÉ Radio 1.

In 1973, &quot;The Gay Byrne Hour&quot; began, becoming &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot; in 1979. This anchored the station&#x27;s daily morning schedule until 1998. On 3 November 1984, current affairs programmes &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; and &quot;Today at Five&quot; began broadcasting. The former is now the flagship programme of RTÉ News and Current Affairs on radio while the latter has evolved into the current &quot;Drivetime&quot; programme via &quot;Five Seven Live&quot;.

==Reception==
RTÉ Radio 1 is available in Ireland on 88-90 MHz FM.

DAB broadcasts of the station began in the east of the country (from the Clermont Carn and Three Rock Mountain high power transmitters via the RTÉ DAB Multiplex) on 1 January 2006. RTÉ DAB is available on the Saorview platform. Listeners to WRN&#x27;s English Service for Europe and English Service for North America can also hear a selection of RTÉ Radio 1 programmes. RTÉ Radio 1 has been carried on shortwave in DRM during specific events, including the All Ireland finals. RTÉ carried out DRM tests on its former longwave frequency 252 kHz.

The station&#x27;s tuning signal since 1936 has been the air &quot;O&#x27;Donnell Abú&quot;, although since the advent of 24-hour broadcasting in 1997, the tune has been played only as a prelude to the start of the day&#x27;s live broadcasting at 5:30 on weekday mornings.

The station broadcasts weekdays from 05:30 - 03:00 and weekends from 06:00 - 02:00. During the station&#x27;s overnight downtime, Radio 1 simulcasts the output of the digital &quot;classic hits&quot; channel RTÉ Gold.

===Satellite===
The FM service is also available online and from the Astra 2E satellite at 28.2° East on transponder 7 (11.914 GHz horizontal, symbol rate 27500, FEC 5/6, service ID 5544), Freesat channel 750, Sky channel 0160 and Virgin Media channel 917.

===Former Medium Wave broadcast===
RTÉ Radio 1 was available until 2008 on medium wave.
The medium-wave transmitters of RTÉ Radio 1 were shut down at 15.00 on 24 March 2008. The main transmitter was based at Tullamore and broadcast on 567 kHz. A lower–powered relay in Cork at 729 kHz was also in service. Before 1975, the main transmitter was based at Athlone using the same frequency. AM transmissions continued on longwave 252 kHz from Summerhill, County Meath until 14 April 2023, aimed to serve Irish people living in Britain and used the old Atlantic 252 transmitter. In 2007 a new telefunken tram 300 kW transmitter was installed which is capable of DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) broadcasts which can transmit up to seven services in near FM quality, but consumer receivers are not being manufactured. The power can be remotely regulated on this transistor-based transmitter. The two original 1989 transmitters were made by continental electronics each 300 kW and were tube based. Because there&#x27;s only one 300 kW transmitter now the maximum possible power is 300 kW even though the site is licensed for 500 kW 24hrs. Since the closure, &quot;Second Helpings&quot; programmes at the weekend have been limited to digital broadcasts only.
Most complaints about the closure of mediumwave were from groups such as fishermen and the elderly, also from people who did not have the longwave band on their radios.

Part of the rationale behind closing medium wave and using long wave to access listeners in hard-to-reach parts of Ireland and the UK, was that reception would be better in places such as the south of England and London areas which in the past had very poor coverage from RTÉ on mediumwave.

The unused 296m medium wave transmission mast at Ballycommon, near Tullamore was demolished on 25 July 2023.

===Former Long Wave broadcast===
RTÉ Radio 1 was available from 2004 to 2023 on 252 kHz longwave (LW), the frequency formerly used by the Atlantic 252 radio station. The LW version of Radio 1, which used to also be able to be received across the United Kingdom and parts of Western Europe, was also the only RTÉ Radio service available in parts of Northern Ireland since the closure of mediumwave. It differed in certain respects from that broadcast on FM, particularly at the weekend, with significant additional sports coverage and religious programming.

RTÉ operated 252 longwave at a markedly lower power level than its ITU licensed 500 kilowatts: 
in the daytime it radiated at 150 kW and at night 60 kW. This reduction in power meant that interference from the French-language station Alger Chaîne 3 – broadcasting on the same frequency from Tipaza with a daytime power of 1,500 kW and 750 kW at night – was considerable, and particularly affected reception of RTÉ Radio 1 on longwave on the south coast of Ireland after dark.

The LW service was due to be withdrawn on Monday 27 October 2014 on cost grounds. However, RTÉ subsequently announced that it had postponed the closure until 19 January 2015 &quot;in order to ensure that listeners, particularly in the UK, have sufficient time to understand and avail themselves of alternatives&quot;. As a result of further public pressure, especially from elderly Irish listeners in Britain, churches, the GAA, emigrant groups, and listeners in Northern Ireland who wouldn&#x27;t all have access to RTÉ on FM or DAB, it was announced in December 2014 that the 252 frequency would be kept on the air until at least 2017, and in March 2017 that transmission on longwave would continue until June 2019. Transmission of RTÉ Radio 1 resumed on 252 longwave in October 2019.

In March 2023 RTE announced that the longwave service would cease on 14 April of that year. The final long wave broadcast occurred during the &quot;Late Date&quot; music programme of Friday night into Saturday morning, 14/15 April 2023, presented by Ciara King. After the 11:55pm weather forecast, the last ever record played on RTE&#x27;s AM services was &quot;Misirlou&quot; by Dick Dale and his Del-Tones. This was followed by the midnight news, after which the closedown of the long wave service occurred at 12:03am on 15 April 2023. After a short silence there was a looped broadcast of the station tuning signal and an information message on other methods of listening to the station. Transmission of the advisory message ceased on 18 April 2023 at 11:00am.

The unused 248m long wave transmission mast at Clarkstown near Summerhill, County Meath was demolished on 27 July 2023.

<doc id="546497" wikidata="Q5497714" url="?curid=546497" title="Frederick Edward Maning">
<text>Frederick Edward Maning (5 July 1812 – 25 July 1883) was an early settler in New Zealand, a writer, and a judge of the Native Land Court. He published two books under the pseudonym of &quot;a Pakeha Maori.&quot;

==Early life==
Maning was born in Johnville, County Dublin, Ireland, the eldest son of moderately wealthy, Protestant Anglo-Irish parents. His father, Frederick Maning, emigrated to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1824 with his wife and three sons to take up farming. Young Maning became a skilled outdoorsman, and built up the physical strength to match his six-foot, three-inch stature. In 1829, his father became a customs officer in Hobart and moved there with his family. It is quite likely that Maning participated in the infamous Black Line and at least witnessed aspects of the Black War. He reportedly did not speak of this period much in his later life. It is possible that these incidents may have contributed to his decision to leave Hobart. By 1832, Frederick had left home to manage a remote outpost in the north of Tasmania. Soon after, Frederick decided to pursue his fortune in New Zealand.

==New Zealand==
Maning arrived in the Hokianga area at age 22, on 30 June 1833, and lived among the Ngāpuhi Māori. With Maning&#x27;s physical skills and great stature, as well as his considerable good humour, he quickly gained favour with the tribe. He became known as a Pākehā Māori (a European turned native) and his arrival in New Zealand is the subject of the first chapters of his book &quot;Old New Zealand&quot;.

In 1837, he sold his property and returned to Hobart. He returned to Hokianga in March 1839 and in September purchased 200 acres (0.8 km2) for a farm at Onoke, at the mouth of the Whirinaki River. He built a house there that was standing until it was destroyed by fire in 2004. He took a Māori wife, Moengaroa, of Te Hikutu &quot;hapū&quot; of Ngāpuhi, and they had four children, Susan, Maria Amina, Hauraki Hereward and Mary.

In 1840, Maning acted as a translator at meetings about the Treaty of Waitangi, and he advised the local Māori to not sign. His vocal opposition to the Treaty was primarily because he had settled with the Māori precisely to escape from the restrictions of European civilisation. He feared that the introduction of European style law would put a damper on his lifestyle and on his entrepreneurial trading activities. He warned the Māori that European colonisation would degrade them. Governor William Hobson countered by telling the Māori that without British Law, lawless self-interested Europeans without any regard for Māori rights would soon take all their land. Maning&#x27;s book &quot;Old New Zealand&quot; is, in part, a lament for the lost freedom enjoyed before European rule. In 1845–1846, during the New Zealand Wars, he sometimes used his influence with the Māori to intercede on behalf of settlers. He also organised supplies to the government&#x27;s Māori supporters. However, he wrote his second book, &quot;A history of the war in the north of New Zealand against the chief Heke&quot; from the perspective of an imaginary supporter of Hōne Heke, who was one of the principal antagonists opposing the government. Maning may even have actually fought with Hone Heke against one of Tāmati Wāka Nene&#x27;s allies, the Hokianga chief, Makoare Te Taonui in the Battle of Te Ahu Ahu. But this seems unlikely as he was known to have sided with the government and Waka Nene by the end of the war.

Through the 1850s, Maning primarily occupied himself with timber and gum trade. In the early 1860s, he retired from business activities. In 1865, he entered the public service as a judge of the Native Land Court, where his unequalled knowledge of the Māori language, customs, traditions, and prejudices was useful.

==Later life==
Maning retired in 1876 although he helped conduct a major land court hearing at Taupō in 1881. He became estranged from his children in his later years. In November 1882, he went to London for an operation; however, he died there on 25 July 1883 of cancer. At his wish, his body was taken back to New Zealand and buried in December 1883, in the Symonds Street Cemetery in Auckland.

Maning is chiefly remembered as the author of two short books, &quot;Old New Zealand&quot; and &quot;History of the War in the North of New Zealand against the Chief Heke&quot;. Both books have been reprinted many times and have become classics of New Zealand literature.

<text>Furan is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen atom. Chemical compounds containing such rings are also referred to as furans.

Furan is a colorless, flammable, highly volatile liquid with a boiling point close to room temperature. It is soluble in common organic solvents, including alcohol, ether, and acetone, and is slightly soluble in water. Its odor is &quot;strong, ethereal; chloroform-like&quot;. It is toxic and may be carcinogenic in humans. Furan is used as a starting point for other speciality chemicals.

== History ==

The name &quot;furan&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;furfur&quot;, which means bran (furfural is produced from bran). The first furan derivative to be described was 2-furoic acid, by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1780. Another important derivative, furfural, was reported by Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner in 1831 and characterised nine years later by John Stenhouse. Furan itself was first prepared by Heinrich Limpricht in 1870, although he called it &quot;tetraphenol&quot; (as if it were a four-carbon analog to phenol, C6H5OH).

==Production==
Industrially, furan is manufactured by the palladium-catalyzed decarbonylation of furfural, or by the copper-catalyzed oxidation of 1,3-butadiene:

In the laboratory, furan can be obtained from furfural by oxidation to 2-furoic acid, followed by decarboxylation. It can also be prepared directly by thermal decomposition of pentose-containing materials, and cellulosic solids, especially pine wood.

===Synthesis of furans===
The Feist–Benary synthesis is a classic way to synthesize furans. The reaction involves alkylation of 1,3-diketones with α-bromoketones followed by dehydration of an intermediate hydroxydihydrofuran. The other traditional route involve the reaction of 1,4-diketones with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) in the Paal–Knorr synthesis. 

Many routes exist for the synthesis of substituted furans.


==Structure and bonding==
Furan has aromatic character because one of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom is delocalized into the ring, creating a aromatic system (see Hückel&#x27;s rule). The aromaticity is modest relative to that for benzene and related heterocycles thiophene and pyrrole. The resonance energies of benzene, pyrrole, thiophene, and furan are, respectively, . Thus, these heterocycles, especially furan, are far less aromatic than benzene, as is manifested in the lability of these rings. The molecule is flat but the C=C groups attached to oxygen retain significant double bond character. The other lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom extends in the plane of the flat ring system. 

Examination of the resonance contributors shows the increased electron density of the ring relative to benzene, leading to increased rates of electrophilic substitution.

==Reactivity==
Because of its partial aromatic character, furan&#x27;s behavior is intermediate between that of an enol ether and an aromatic ring. It is dissimilar vs ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. 

Like enol ethers, 2,5-disubstituted furans are susceptible to hydrolysis to reversibly give 1,4-diketones. 

Furan serves as a diene in Diels–Alder reactions with electron-deficient dienophiles such as ethyl (&quot;E&quot;)-3-nitroacrylate. The reaction product is a mixture of isomers with preference for the &quot;endo&quot; isomer:
Diels-Alder reaction of furan with arynes provides corresponding derivatives of dihydronaphthalenes, which are useful intermediates in synthesis of other polycyclic aromatic compounds.

* It is considerably more reactive than benzene in electrophilic substitution reactions, due to the electron-donating effects of the oxygen heteroatom. It reacts with bromine at 0 °C to give 2-bromofuran.

* Hydrogenation of furans sequentially affords dihydrofurans and tetrahydrofurans.
* In the Achmatowicz reaction, furans are converted to dihydropyran compounds.
* Pyrrole can be prepared industrially by treating furan with ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalysts, such as SiO2 and Al2O3.

==Safety==
Furan is found in heat-treated commercial foods and is produced through thermal degradation of natural food constituents. It can be found in roasted coffee, instant coffee, and processed baby foods. Research has indicated that coffee made in espresso makers and coffee made from capsules contain more furan than that made in traditional drip coffee makers, although the levels are still within safe health limits.

Exposure to furan at doses about 2,000 times the projected level of human exposure from foods increases the risk of hepatocellular tumors in rats and mice and bile duct tumors in rats. Furan is therefore listed as a possible human carcinogen.

<doc id="546509" wikidata="Q1252386" url="?curid=546509" title="Douglas Lloyd Campbell">
<text>Douglas Lloyd Campbell (May 27, 1895 – April 23, 1995) was a Canadian politician in Manitoba. He served as the 13th premier of Manitoba from 1948 to 1958. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 47 years, longer than anyone in the province&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
Born in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, the son of John Howard Campbell and Mary Campbell, Campbell was educated there and in Brandon. He worked as a farmer and school teacher before entering politics. He was also active as a Freemason, serving as master of Assiniboine Lodge No. 7 in Portage. He married, in 1920, Gladys Victoria Crampton, daughter of William Nassau Crampton and Elizabeth Dezell. They had eight children together, though the last child died soon after birth.

==Provincial political career==

In 1922, Campbell defeated several other contenders to become the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) candidate in Lakeside, north of Winnipeg. At the UFM nomination meeting, he made a virtue of his inexperience as a professional politician. A commanding speaker, he was soon regarded as a rising star in the party.

The UFM swept Manitoba&#x27;s countryside in 1922, and Campbell defeated his only opponent, Conservative Herbert Muir, by about 500 votes. He faced opposition from Conservative J.R. Bend in 1927 and 1932, but won on both occasions. No other party ran a candidate against him during this period.

The UFM, which governed as the Progressive Party of Manitoba, was founded on an ideology of non-partisan, managerial government, with special attention to rural concerns. The Progressives formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1932, and Campbell (among with the others in his party) subsequently became known as a &quot;Liberal-Progressive&quot;. He again faced Conservative opposition in 1936, this time winning by about 350 votes.

===Cabinet minister===
On December 21, 1936, Campbell was sworn in as Minister of Agriculture in John Bracken&#x27;s government. He also became Minister of the Manitoba Power Commission on February 5, 1944. In this capacity, he was responsible for overseeing a rural electrification program, which created the framework for Manitoba Hydro.

Bracken&#x27;s government was expanded into an all-party coalition in 1940, with the Conservatives, Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and Social Credit all holding cabinet positions. Campbell faced no opposition in the election of 1941, and also won by acclamation in 1945 and 1949.

===Premier of Manitoba===
John Bracken jumped from provincial to federal politics in 1943, and his successor Stuart Garson did the same in 1948. On the latter occasion, Campbell defeated Conservative leader Errick Willis in a vote of the coalition caucuses to become the province&#x27;s next Premier. He was sworn in on November 13, 1948, only the second native-born Manitoban to serve in this office. On December 14 of the same year, he also became Minister of Dominion-Provincial Relations. The selection of Campbell was opposed by many Conservatives, some of whom called for a new coalition agreement.

Campbell&#x27;s government continued the rural electrification program begun by Garson. However, it was otherwise cautious and conservative, opposing government expansion and bilingualism. Campbell commissioned a study on alcohol sales (written by former Premier Bracken) that brought about some reforms; nevertheless, the province maintained a number of restrictive &quot;blue laws&quot; on alcohol and Sunday shopping. Manitoba&#x27;s education system remained backwards, having the most one room schoolhouses in Canada. Despite the Liberal label, Campbell&#x27;s government was one of the most right-wing provincial governments in Canada.

The coalition government ended in 1950, with the Progressive Conservatives (which the Conservatives became after 1942) leaving in protest against Campbell&#x27;s &#x27;minimal-government&#x27; philosophy. The Tories were still led by Errick Willis, although the impetus for separation had come primarily from MLA Dufferin Roblin.

The Manitoba Tories had more or less vanished at the grassroots level during the coalition government, and in the 1953 election, Campbell&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives won a convincing victory (32 of 57 seats). After the election, Roblin replaced Willis as leader of the Progressive Conservatives and developed a platform of infrastructural development and modernization. Campbell&#x27;s opposition to any sort of state intervention essentially put him further to the right of the Tory opposition by this time.

Campbell often had poor relations with the federal Liberals in the late 1950s, despite the fact that Garson was a powerful cabinet minister for the party. John Diefenbaker&#x27;s upset victory of 1957 was partly based on unexpected support from Manitoba—Campbell later claimed that he contributed to the federal Liberal defeat.

The provincial election of 1958 resulted in a hung parliament, with the Tories winning 26 seats against 19 for the Liberal-Progressives, and 11 for the CCF, and one Independent. Campbell initially offered to govern in alliance with the CCF, but discussions between the parties went nowhere. When it became apparent that the CCF was instead willing to support the Tories, Campbell resigned as Premier on June 30. The next year, Roblin&#x27;s Tories won a parliamentary majority and Campbell&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives were reduced to 11 seats.

===Post-premiership===
Campbell remained as Leader of the Opposition until 1961, when he resigned as leader of what was by now known as the Manitoba Liberal Party; Gildas Molgat succeeded him. He continued to serve as MLA for Lakeside until standing down in 1969, and exercised a powerful influence over the Liberals during this time. His 47 continuous years in the legislature (including 25 years as a minister or opposition frontbencher) remains a provincial record.

==Later life==
Campbell resurfaced in the 1980s as a supporter of populist conservative movements—first the Confederation of Regions Party, and subsequently the Reform Party of Preston Manning. He also spoke at rallies for Sidney Green&#x27;s Progressive Party, noting parallels to the earlier party of the same name.

Campbell&#x27;s political philosophy remained consistent through his shifting party allegiances. Sidney Green (who began his career as a socialist) once described him as &quot;the most politically conservative politician I knew during my years in politics&quot;. On economic and social issues alike, he opposed most government intervention into the lives of citizens. Although not a libertarian, he was a lifelong believer in &quot;small government&quot;.

In 1972, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Douglas Campbell died on 23 April 1995 at the age of 99. His wife died in 1987.

<text>The A465 is a trunk road that runs from Bromyard in Herefordshire, England to Llandarcy near Swansea in south Wales. The western half in Wales is known officially as the Neath to Abergavenny Trunk Road, but the section from Abergavenny to the Vale of Neath is more commonly referred to as the Heads of the Valleys Road because it links the northern heads of the South Wales Valleys. This section is also the subject of a major upgrade programme of which sections 1 to 4 are complete (Abergavenny to Dowlais Top), and sections 5 to 6 are under construction (Dowlais Top to Hirwaun). The upgrade programme involves the conversion of the A465 to a dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction, and is due to be completed by Summer 2025. Approximately following the southern boundary of the Brecon Beacons National Park, the Ordnance Survey &quot;Pathfinder&quot; guide describes it as the unofficial border between rural and industrial South Wales. The A465 provides an alternative route between England and the counties in South West Wales and to the ferries to Ireland.

==Route==
The A465 runs south-west from Bromyard towards the River Lugg, from where it runs concurrently with the A4103 for a short distance before entering Hereford. After a short distance on the A49, it crosses the River Wye, the River Monnow and the border into Wales. The A465 meets the A40 trunk road in Abergavenny and continues west through the &#x27;Heads of the Valleys&#x27; region past Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale, Tredegar, Rhymney, Merthyr Tydfil, Hirwaun, Glynneath and Aberdulais.
Even before the construction of the Heads of the Valleys road began in the 1960s, there were concerns and complaints regarding the capacity and safety of a single carriageway, three-lane design. The AbergavennyNeath trunk road opened in 1964.

Until 1996, the A465 ran for most of its length between Glynneath and Aberdulais along a narrow single carriageway road, now redesignated as the B4242. The high collision rate on this stretch was the main factor in leading to the construction of the dual carriageway between these points. The section of the A465 from Hirwaun to Llandarcy is all dual carriageway.

The highest point (signposted) of is on the Ebbw Vale section which is now dual carriageway and slip roads between Dowlais Top and Tredegar via Rhymney. At Dowlais Top there are link roads such as the A4060, which runs down to the south end of Merthyr Tydfil and links with the A470, and the A4054 which goes through Merthyr Vale and Aberfan. Another link is the A4102 which leads into Dowlais and Merthyr Tydfil town centre. The A465 passes Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil and then continues to Cefn-coed-y-cymmer and the A470 link. It then continues down the floor of the Vale of Neath, bypassing Resolven, Neath and Skewen, before terminating at junction 43 of the M4 at Llandarcy.

==Major upgrade==
In 1990, a regional traffic study identified the need for improvements to the A465. In 1994, alternatives were presented for public consultation for the improvement of the 25-mile length between Abergavenny and Hirwaun, connecting the existing A465 dual carriageway link from Swansea to the A40, which is an important part of the route to the M50. In July 1995 the then Secretary of State for Wales announced the preferred route. This mainly consisted of widening the existing road to provide a dual carriageway standard with grade-separated junctions (and extra climbing lanes on certain hills) between Abergavenny and Hirwaun. The design was developed and a draft line order was published in 1997. This was tested at public local inquiry in 1998 after which the Secretary of State for Wales announced the decision to proceed with the scheme in 1999.

Much of the land on the route is undulating, but despite this, the preferred route alignment is considered to be of high standard and as such allows most of the route to have the national speed limit.

Initially, the upgrade was split into seven sections. Later, sections 6 and 7 were combined into a single scheme for the purposes of construction. Construction of sections 5 and 6 has also been treated as a single scheme.
=== Sections 1 to 4 ===
The A465 between Llandarcy and Hirwaun was initially constructed to dual carriageway standard, and as such will not see a major upgrade. Construction work began on section 4 (Tredegar to Dowlais Top) in early spring 2002, and was completed by November 2004.

Construction of Section 1 (Abergavenny to Gilwern) began in February 2005. This was primarily an on-line upgrade of the existing single-carriageway road, and was completed on 22 May 2008.

The contract for Section 3 (Brynmawr to Tredegar) was awarded to Carillion in March 2010. In August 2012, it was announced that approval for the scheme to commence had been given and that construction would commence by the end of 2012.

Planning for Section 2 (Gilwern to Brynmawr) started in June 2011, with construction beginning in January 2015. The project was due to be finished in 2018. However, this section saw several delays and cost overruns, and was completed in December 2021.

=== Sections 5 and 6 ===
On 10 November 2020, the Welsh Government announced that the contract for Section 5 &amp; 6 (Dowlais Top to Hirwaun) had been awarded to Future Valleys Construction, a consortium which &#x27;comprises large international construction companies alongside established financial investors&#x27;. Site clearance works began shortly thereafter, and major construction work commenced in May 2021. Completion of the scheme is programmed for mid-2025.

<doc id="546558" wikidata="Q6459176" url="?curid=546558" title="LMS Turbomotive">
<text>The LMS Turbomotive was a modified LMS Princess Royal Class steam turbine locomotive designed by William Stanier and built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1935. It was inspired by the Swedish Ljungström locomotives first introduced in 1922. It used turbines instead of cylinders. It was later rebuilt as a conventional locomotive No. 46202 &quot;Princess Anne&quot;.

== Design ==

The locomotive chassis was constructed as the third prototype of the LMS Princess Royal Class, utilising the class frame design, and numbered 6202.

The forward turbine had 18 rows of blading. Power output was at 7,060 rpm, corresponding to running at . Boiler pressure was . The turbine was designed to operate into a maximum back-pressure of , allowing a conventional double blast-pipe to provide the boiler draught, and eliminating draught fans, which always seemed to give a disproportionate amount of trouble.

The reverse turbine had four rows of blades. It was engaged by a dog clutch, activated when the reverser lever was set to &quot;0&quot;. This was originally steam-operated by a small piston and cylinder.

Compared to some other experimental steam locomotives of the era, such as the LNER&#x27;s W1, Turbomotive was relatively successful, showing a saving of coal compared to a normal reciprocating engine and no hammer blow on the track. Because steam turbines are highly inefficient when throttled (not a problem on steamships, where turbines typically run at constant output, but a major disadvantage for a railway locomotive which has to run at different speeds), power was instead controlled by turning on a different number of nozzles (from the six available) through which steam was admitted to the turbine. One disadvantage of the design was that the small reverse turbine only had sufficient power for manoeuvring &quot;light engine&quot; and the locomotive always had to be turned to face forwards in order to pull a train.

When a turbine failure occurred in 1949, it was considered uneconomic to repair, due to post-war austerity measures, so the locomotive was taken out of service pending a rebuild.

== 46202 Princess Anne ==

46202 was rebuilt as a conventional locomotive in 1952, using new mainframes and a set of cylinders of the same type as used in the &quot;Coronation&quot; Class, and named &quot;Princess Anne&quot;. On 8 October 1952, after only two months in service, while hauling an express train bound for Liverpool Lime Street, it was involved in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash. The locomotive was taken to Crewe, where it was deemed beyond economical repair and scrapped. The destruction of No. 46202 led to the construction of BR Standard Class 8 number 71000, &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot;.

<text>Landor is a brand consulting firm founded in 1941 by Walter Landor, who pioneered some research, design, and consulting methods that the branding industry still uses.

Headquartered in London, the company maintains 32 offices, including China, France, Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Africa, Spain and the United States. Landor is a member of the network WPP plc, the world&#x27;s largest advertising company by revenues.

Landor&#x27;s work includes brand research and valuation, brand strategy and architecture, brand purpose and design, corporate identity and packaging design, innovation, naming and writing, branded experience, brand equity management, employee engagement, and digital branding.

==History==

===Origin===
German immigrant Walter Landor and his wife Josephine (the original &quot;associate&quot;) founded the company in 1941. Walter Landor intended to &quot;...concentrate on designing everyday products that would make life more pleasant and more beautiful.&quot;

Some of Landor&#x27;s earliest designs were beer company logos that earned awards from the Brewers Association of America and the Small Brewers Association. For Arrowhead, Landor created a tilt bottle with two flat sides that could be poured without being lifted from the table. This unique design won several awards, drew media attention, and brought additional business to the firm. It was also selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce to appear in three International Trade Fairs.

Walter Landor favoured what he felt was a client-driven approach. He was one of the first to apply consumer research to package design, and relied heavily on observing consumers in real-life situations—even soliciting in-store feedback from shoppers regarding label design. In Walter Landor&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;The package itself must do the talking.&quot;

As Landor&#x27;s reputation grew, the company&#x27;s client list expanded to encompass airlines, financial institutions, government agencies, hospitality services and technology firms. Over time, Landor broadened its consulting services to offer corporate and product naming, brand positioning and architecture, retail environment design, copywriting, internal brand engagement, digital branding and BrandAsset Valuator analysis, corporate identity and package design.

===1960s-1980s===
From the 1960s to the 1980s, Landor established its headquarters on board the renovated ferryboat &quot;Klamath&quot;, moored in San Francisco Bay. This unusual arrangement was intended to foster creativity among the firm&#x27;s employees. Mixing business with pleasure, the &quot;Klamath&quot; also hosted business symposia, cultural events and parties that included dignitaries, artists, business tycoons and celebrities. Although Landor&#x27;s business eventually outgrew the ferryboat and moved to larger offices on land, the &quot;Klamath&quot; has remained its corporate symbol.

===Recent years===
In 1989 the company was acquired by the advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam and subsequently became part of WPP Group.

In 1994, the Walter Landor/Landor Collection was established at the National Museum of American History, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The collection contains business records and personal papers belonging to Walter Landor, oral histories, and portfolio materials such as original designer notebooks.

Since 2004, Landor has published an annual survey of brand strength measured over a three-year period. The Breakaway Brands list is based on data culled from the proprietary BrandAsset Valuator and is regularly cited in business publications including &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine and &quot;Forbes&quot;.

In 2021, Landor merged with the experience design agency Fitch to form the new agency Landor &amp; Fitch. In 2023 the company&#x27;s name reverted back to Landor.

<doc id="546592" wikidata="Q72154" url="?curid=546592" title="Amundsen Sea">
<text>The Amundsen Sea is an arm of the Southern Ocean off Marie Byrd Land in western Antarctica. It lies between Cape Flying Fish (the northwestern tip of Thurston Island) to the east and Cape Dart on Siple Island to the west. Cape Flying Fish marks the boundary between the Amundsen Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea. West of Cape Dart there is no named marginal sea of the Southern Ocean between the Amundsen and Ross Seas. The Norwegian expedition of 1928–1929 under Captain Nils Larsen named the body of water for the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen while exploring this area in February 1929.

The sea is mostly ice-covered, and the Thwaites Ice Tongue protrudes into it. The ice sheet which drains into the Amundsen Sea averages about in thickness; roughly the size of the state of Texas, this area is known as the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE); it forms one of the three major ice-drainage basins of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

== Embayment ==

The ice sheet that drains into the Amundsen Sea averages about in thickness. It is roughly the size of the state of Texas and is known as the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE); it forms one of the three major ice drainage basins of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet along with the Ross Sea Embayment and the Weddell Sea Embayment.

Some scientists proposed that this region may be a weak underbelly of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers, which both flow into the Amundsen Sea, are two of Antarctica&#x27;s largest five. Researchers reported that the flow of these glaciers increased starting in the mid-2000s; if they were to melt completely, global sea levels would rise by about . Other researchers suggested that the loss of these glaciers would destabilise the entire West Antarctic ice sheet and possibly sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

A 2004 study suggested that because the ice in the Amundsen Sea had been melting rapidly and was riven with cracks, the offshore ice shelf was set to collapse &quot;within five years&quot;. The study projected a sea level rise of from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet if all the sea ice in the Amundsen Sea melted.

Measurements made by the British Antarctic Survey in 2005 showed that the ice discharge rate into the Amundsen Sea embayment was about 250 km3 per year. Assuming a steady rate of discharge, this alone was sufficient to raise global sea levels by 0.2 mm per year.

A subglacial volcano was detected just north of the Pine Island Glacier near the Hudson Mountains. It last erupted approximately 2,200 years ago, indicated by widespread ash deposits within the ice, in what was the largest known eruption in Antarctica within the prior 10 millennia. Volcanic activity may be contributing to the observed increase of glacial flow, although the most popular theory is that the flow has increased due to warming ocean water. This water has warmed due to an upwelling of deep ocean water due to variations in pressure systems, which could have been affected by global warming.

In January 2010, a modelling study suggested that the &quot;tipping point&quot; for Pine Island Glacier may have been passed in 1996, with a retreat of possible by 2100, producing a corresponding of sea level rise. It was suggested that these estimates were conservative. The modelling study also stated that &quot;Given the complex, three-dimensional nature of the real Pine Island glacier ... it should be clear that the [...] model is a very crude representation of reality.&quot;

A 2023 study estimated that the area lost 3.3 trillion tons of ice between 1996 and 2021, raising sea levels by 9 millimeters.

== Pine Island Bay ==

Pine Island Bay () is a bay about long and wide, into which flows the ice of the Pine Island Glacier at the southeast extremity of the Amundsen Sea. It was delineated from aerial photographs taken by United States Navy (USN) Operation HIGHJUMP in December 1946, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for the USS &quot;Pine Island&quot;, seaplane tender and flagship of the eastern task group of USN Operation HIGHJUMP which explored this area.

== Russell Bay ==

Russell Bay () is a rather open bay in southwestern Amundsen Sea, extending along the north sides of Siple Island, Getz Ice Shelf and Carney Island, from Pranke Island to Cape Gates. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and USN air photos, 1959–66, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Admiral James S. Russell, Vice Chief of Naval Operations during the post 1957–58 IGY period.

<doc id="546601" wikidata="Q1140133" url="?curid=546601" title="Ford Capri">
<text>The Ford Capri is a fastback coupé built by Ford of Europe and designed by Philip T. Clark, who had been involved in the design of the Ford Mustang. It used the mechanical components from the Mk2 Ford Cortina and was intended as the European equivalent of the Ford Mustang. The Capri went on to be highly successful for Ford, selling nearly 1.9 million units in its lifetime. A wide variety of engines were used in the car throughout its production lifespan, which included the Essex and Cologne V6 at the top of the range, while the Kent straight-four and Taunus V4 engines were used in lower-specification models. Although the Capri was not officially replaced, the second-generation Probe was effectively its replacement after the later car&#x27;s introduction to the European market in 1994.
==History==
===Ford Capri Mk I (1969–1974)===
Production of the Capri began in November 1968. It was unveiled in January 1969 at the Brussels Motor Show, with sales starting the following month. The intention was to reproduce in Europe the success Ford had had with the North American Ford Mustang by producing a European pony car.

It was mechanically based on the Cortina and built in Europe at the Halewood plant in the United Kingdom, the Genk plant in Belgium, and the Saarlouis and Cologne plants in Germany. The car was named Colt during its development stage, but Ford was unable to use the name, which had already been trademarked by Mitsubishi (and used since 1962 on its Colt).

The name Capri comes from the Italian island and this was the second time Ford had used the name, the previous model being the Ford Consul Capri, often just known as the Capri in the same way the Ford Consul Cortina and Ford Consul Classic rarely used the &quot;Consul&quot; in everyday use (the Ford Consul Cortina was officially renamed Ford Cortina in 1964).

Ford wanted the flashy fastback coupé to be affordable for a broad spectrum of potential buyers, which it made possible in part by making it available in a variety of engines. The British and German factories produced different Capri Mk I line-ups, with the continental model using the Ford Taunus V4 engine in 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 L engine displacements, and British the Ford Kent straight-four in 1.3 and 1.6 L form. The Ford Essex V4 engine 2.0 L (British built) and Cologne V6 2.0 L (German built) served as initial range-toppers. At the end of the year, new sports versions were added: the 2300 GT in Germany, using a double-barrel carburettor with , and in September 1969 the 3000 GT in the UK, with the Essex V6, capable of .

Under the new body, the running gear was very similar to the 1966 Cortina. The rear suspension employed a live axle supported on leaf springs with short radius rods. MacPherson struts were featured at the front in combination with rack and pinion steering (sourced from the Ford Escort) which employed a steering column that would collapse in response to a collision.

The initial reception of the car was broadly favourable. The range continued to be broadened, with another 3.0 variant, the Capri 3000E introduced from the British plant in March 1970, offering &quot;more luxurious interior trim&quot;.

Ford began selling the Capri in the Australian market in May 1969 and in April 1970 it was released in the North American and South African markets. The South African Models initially used the Kent 1.6 engine and the V4 2.0 version of the Essex, although a Pinto straight-four 2.0 L replaced it in some markets in 1971. An exception, though, was the Perana manufactured by Basil Green Motors near Johannesburg, which was powered first by a 3.0 Essex engine and then by a 302ci V8 Ford Windsor engine after Ford South Africa began offering 3.0 Essex-engined options. All North American versions featured the &quot;power dome&quot; hood and four round 5&quot; U.S.-spec headlights. They carried no &quot;Ford&quot; badging, as the Capri was only sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers (with the Mercury division handling sales) and promoted to U.S. drivers as &quot;the sexy European&quot;.


The Capri was sold in Japan with both the 1.6 L and 2.0 L engines in GT trim. Sales were handled in Japan by Kintetsu Motors, then an exclusive importer of Ford products to Japan. The 2.0-litre engine required Japanese owners to pay more annual road tax in comparison to the 1.6-litre engine, which affected sales.

A new 2637 cc version of the Cologne V6 engine assembled by Weslake and featuring their special all alloy cylinder heads appeared in September 1971, powering the Capri RS2600. This model used Kugelfischer fuel injection to raise power to and was the basis for the Group 2 RS2600 used in the European Touring Car Championship. The RS2600 also received modified suspension, a close ratio gearbox, lightened bodywork panels, ventilated disc brakes and aluminium wheels. It could hit 100 km/h from a standstill in 7.7 seconds. The 2.6 L engine was detuned in September for the deluxe version 2600 GT, with 2550 cc and a double-barrel Solex carburettor. Germany&#x27;s Dieter Glemser won the drivers&#x27; title in the 1971 European Touring Car Championship at the wheel of a Ford Köln entered RS2600 and fellow German Jochen Mass did likewise in 1972.

The first Ford Special, was the Capri Vista Orange Special.
The Capri Special was launched in November 1971 and was based on the 1600 GT, and 2000 GT models. It was only available in vista orange and was optional dealer fitted with a Ford Rally Sport boot mounted spoiler and rear window slats – a direct link to the Mustang. The Special also had some additional standard extras such as a push-button radio, fabric seat upholstery, inertia reel seat belts, heated rear screen and black vinyl roof. There were only 1200 Vista Orange Capri Specials made.
One of the last limited editions of the original Mk I, was a version that came in either metallic green or black with red interior and featured some additional extras, such as cloth inserts in the seats, hazard lights, map reading light, opening rear windows, vinyl roof and for the first time a bonnet bulge was fitted to the sub-3.0-litre models. This special edition was only available with a 1.6 or 2.0 engines and had the full title of GTXLR Special.

====Mk I facelift====
The Capri proved highly successful, with 400,000 cars sold in its first two years. Ford revised it in late 1971. It received new and more comfortable suspension, enlarged tail-lights (replacing the one sourced from the Escort Mk1) and new seats. Larger headlamps with separate indicators were also fitted, with quad headlamps now featured on the 3000GXL model. The Kent engines were replaced by the Ford Pinto engine and the previously UK-only 3000 GT joined the German line-up. In the UK the 2.0 L V4 remained in use.

In addition, North American versions received larger rubber-covered bumpers (to comply with US DOT regulations) for 1973.

In 1973, the Capri saw the highest sales total it would ever attain, at 233,000 vehicles: the 1,000,000th Capri, an RS 2600, was completed on 29 August.

On 25 September 1973, Ford gave the green light to the long-awaited RHD RS Capri, replacing the Cologne V6 based RS 2600 with the Essex V6 based RS 3100, with the usual 3.0 L Essex V6&#x27;s displacement increased to by boring the cylinders from the of the 3.0 L to . Unlike its predecessor, it used the same double-barrel 38-DGAS Weber carburetor as the standard 3.0 L, and reached the same at 5000 rpm as the RS 2600 and at 3000 rpm of torque. The RS 3100&#x27;s ride height was one inch lower than other Capris, and also featured other unique modifications such as gold pinstriping, a ducktail rear spoiler, a re-drilled crossmember to move the suspension arms outward to provide negative camber which also made it necessary to have special wider flared front wings, heavy duty springs with Bilstein gas dampers at the front and rear, competition single rear leaf springs, special bump rubbers and spacer blocks, a small front air dam and larger 9.75 inch front ventilated disc brakes. These modifications made the RS 3100 very stable at high speeds but several reviews also complained about its rough ride. Only 250 RS3100s were built for homologation purposes between November 1973 and December 1973 so its racing version could be eligible for competition in the over three-litre Group 2 class for the 1974 season However, the car was still competitive in touring car racing, and Ford Motorsport produced a 100-model limited edition with this new engine. The Group 2 RS3100&#x27;s engine was tuned by Cosworth into the GAA, with , fuel injection, DOHC, 4 valves per cylinder and in racing trim. The car also featured improved aerodynamics. Besides the racing RS3100, the GAA engine was also used in the Formula 5000 racing category.


===Ford Capri Mk II – &#x27;Capri II&#x27; (1974–1978)===

On 25 February 1974, the Capri II was introduced. After 1.2 million cars sold, and with the 1973 oil crisis, Ford chose to make the new car more suited to everyday driving with a shorter bonnet, larger cabin and the adoption of a hatchback rear door (accessing a 630-litre boot). This made it the first Ford to feature a hatchback, at a time when the hatchback was becoming increasingly popular in Europe after first being patented by Renault in the mid-1960s. By the standards of the mid-1970s, the Capri II was a very well evolved vehicle with very few reliability issues. For Germany the Capri now offered 1.3-litre (), 1.6-litre (), 1.6-litre GT (), or 2.0-litre () straight-four engines, complemented by a 2.3-litre V6 () and the UK sourced 3.0-litre V6 with (), available with either a four-speed Ford Type 5 manual transmission or one of Ford&#x27;s new C3 three-speed automatic transmissions available on all models except the 1.3, the C3 automatic transmission proved to be a very popular option among Ghia buyers, therefore it became standard on all Ghia models after the 1976 model year and the four-speed manual transmission became optional.

Although it was mechanically similar to the Mark I, the Capri II had a revised, larger body and a more modern dashboard and a smaller steering wheel. The 2.0 L version of the Pinto engine was introduced in the European model and was placed below the 2.3-litre V6 and the 3.0-litre V6. The Capri still maintained the large rectangular headlights, which became the easiest way to distinguish between a Mark II and a Mark III. Larger front disc brakes, a standard alternator and a front air-dam on all S models finished the list of modifications.

Ford introduced the John Player Special limited edition, (known as the JPS) in March 1975. Available only in black or white, the JPS featured yards of gold pinstriping to mimic the Formula 1 livery, gold-coloured wheels, and a bespoke upgraded interior of beige cloth and carpet trimmed with black. In May 1976, and with sales decreasing, the intermediate 3.0 GT models disappeared to give way for the upscale 3.0 S and Ghia designations. In October 1976, the only UK plant producing Capris, Ford&#x27;s Halewood plant stopped production, and all production of the Capri was moved to the Cologne factory in Germany.

The last year that Capris were made for the US market was 1977, with 513,500 cars sold in the year.

====Engines====

===Ford Capri Mk III (1978–1986)===
The Capri Mk III was referred to internally as &quot;Project Carla&quot;, and although little more than an update of the Capri II, it was often referred to as the Mk III. The first cars were available in March 1978, and sold very well initially. The concept of a heavily facelifted Capri II was shown at the 1976 Geneva show: a Capri II with a front very similar to the Escort RS2000 (with four headlamps and black slatted grille), and with a rear spoiler, essentially previewed the model some time before launch. The new styling cues, most notably the black &quot;Aeroflow&quot; grille (first used on the Mk I Fiesta) and the &quot;sawtooth&quot; rear lamp lenses echoed the new design language being introduced at that time by Ford of Europe&#x27;s chief stylist Uwe Bahnsen across the entire range. Similar styling elements were subsequently introduced in the 1979 Cortina 80, 1980 Escort Mk III and the 1981 Granada Mk IIb. In addition, the Mk III featured improved aerodynamics, leading to improved performance and economy over the Mk II. The trademark quad headlamps were introduced, while the bonnet&#x27;s leading edge was pulled down over the top of the headlamps, making the appearance more aggressive.

At launch the existing engine and transmission combinations of the Capri II were carried over, with the 3.0 S model regarded as the most desirable model although in Britain the softer, more luxurious Ghia derivative with automatic, rather than manual transmission, was the bigger seller of the two V6-engined models. In Germany, the &quot;S&quot; models were by far the most popular equipment level (across all engines), representing 63 percent of Capri sales there.

Ford began to focus their attention on the UK Capri market as sales declined elsewhere, realising the car had something of a cult following there. Unlike sales of the contemporary four-door Cortina, Capri sales in Britain were mostly to private buyers who would demand fewer discounts than fleet buyers, allowing for higher margins on the coupé. Ford tried to maintain interest in 1977 with Ford Rallye Sport, Series X, &quot;X Pack&quot; options from the performance oriented RS parts range. Although expensive and slow selling these proved that the press would enthusiastically cover more developed Capris with higher performance.

However, the rise in popularity of &quot;hot hatchbacks&quot; and sports saloons during the early 1980s saw demand for affordable sports car fall throughout Europe. Between 1980 and 1983, Ford launched the Fiesta XR2, Escort XR3/XR3i and Sierra XR4i. All of these sold well, while their introduction onto the market saw a decline in Capri sales even in the UK. Several of its competitors had already been discontinued without a direct replacement, most notably British Leyland&#x27;s MG B which was not directly replaced when the Abingdon factory which produced it was closed in 1980. Vauxhall had launched coupe versions of its MK1 Cavalier in 1978 but when the MK2 Cavalier was launched in 1981 there were no new coupe versions. Renault did not replace its Fuego coupe which was discontinued in 1986.

In addition to being the most popular sporting model in Britain for most of its production life, the third generation Capri was also one of the most stolen cars in Britain during the 1980s and early 1990s, being classified as &quot;high risk&quot; of theft in a Home Office report.

The 3.0 S was used extensively in the TV series &quot;The Professionals&quot; in the early 1980s, with characters Bodie driving a silver 3.0 S and Doyle a gold 3.0 S.

On 30 November 1984, production of Capris for the European market ceased, from then on it would only be produced in right-hand drive form for the British market. Ford had decided not to launch a direct successor to the Capri, as it did not feel that demand for affordable coupes in Europe was sufficient for a new Capri to be developed. Ford was, however, enjoying success with high performance versions of the Fiesta, Escort and Sierra, which appealed mostly to buyers who might have been expected to buy a Capri before 1980.

Ford made a return to the coupe market in Europe when the American built Probe was made available to European buyers from 1994. This car was less successful, and was withdrawn after just three years. Its successor, the Cougar, was also built in the States but was only imported to Europe for two years after its 1998 launch. The smaller Puma, produced from 1997 to 2002, was more successful, but Ford did not replace it directly, instead launching faster versions of the Fiesta and Focus hatchbacks soon after the Puma&#x27;s demise. The Puma was the last coupe that Ford has produced for the European market until the American built Mustang was introduced in both right and left hand drive and sold in both Europe and the UK.

====2.8 Injection models====
For the 1982 model year, the Essex 3.0 V6 powerplant which had been the range topper since September 1969 was dropped, mainly because of ever more strict emissions regulations, that Ford knew the old Essex V6 design could not meet, a new sporty version debuted at the Geneva Motor Show, called the 2.8 Injection. The new model was the first regular model since the RS2600 to use fuel injection. Power rose to a claimed , even though tests showed the real figure was closer to , giving a top speed of , but the car still had a standard four-speed gearbox. The Capri 2.8 Injection breathed new life into the range and kept the car in production 2–3 years longer than Ford had planned. The four-speed gearbox was replaced with a five-speed unit early on – at the same time Ford swapped the dated looking chequered seats for more luxurious looking velour trim. A more substantial upgrade was introduced in 1984 with the Capri Injection Special. This development used half leather seating and included a limited slip differential. Externally the car could be easily distinguished by seven spoke RS wheels (without the customary &quot;RS&quot; logo since this was not an RS vehicle) and colour-coded grille and headlamp surrounds. At the same time the 2.0 Capri was rationalised to one model, the 2.0 S, which simultaneously adopted a mildly modified suspension from the Capri Injection. The 1.6 model was also reduced to a single model, the 1.6 LS.

By the 1986 model year - the Capri&#x27;s final year on sale - the range had been rationalised even further to just the 1.6 Laser, 2.0 Laser and the 2.8 Injection.


====Series X &amp; GP1====
The Mark II and Mark III 3.0-litre X-pack special performance options pack for the Capri were offered between 1977 and 1980. They used a special glassfibre wide bodykit made by Fibresports, larger ventilated front disc brakes (retaining the standard drums at the rear), Bilstein gas-filled rear dampers and front struts (used with single rear leaf springs), an &quot;anti-dive kit&quot;, a Salisbury limited slip differential (LSD) and a choice of two performance upgrades for Essex V6 3.0 L engines. The first upgrade, called the GP1 or Group 1 pack, bumped power up to . This engine included larger valves, ported cylinder heads and a Weber 40 DFI5 carburetor and other optional performance upgrades. The second option, referred to as Series X or X Pack, offered and 195 lb/ft of torque, thanks to three Weber 42 DCNF two-barrel carburetors fed by an electric fuel pump, the same ported cylinder heads and larger inlet and exhaust valves as the GP1. It used special head gaskets even though the standard compression ratio of 9.0:1 and standard camshaft were retained. The X Pack was also equipped with a wing as standard and it featured unique 7.5 x 13 inch wheels, for which a special bodykit was made. The X Pack included a free flowing performance exhaust system with distinctive flattened rear ends. The X Pack Capri could reach 60 mph from standing in 7.4 seconds, a full second faster than the standard 3.0-litre Capri, and had a top speed of 130 mph. These upgrades could only be bought through and fitted by one of the 80 Ford RS Motorsport dealerships in the UK, or a complete new car could be ordered factory equipped through a Ford Motorsport dealer. It is estimated that little over 100 conversions were made.

The X Pack was also available in mainland Europe between 1979 and 1980 where it was marketed as the 3.0 RS even though it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t ever an official RS like the 2600 or 3100. All were white with blue stripes and used standard 3.0 Engines, Only 100 of these were ever made, and 1980 was the last year for both the German RS and British X Pack. The next year the 3.0 engine option disappeared completely to give way for the new 2.8 Injection models.

====2.8 Turbo====
From July 1981 to September 1982, German RS dealers marketed a limited edition, Zakspeed inspired, left-hand drive only, &#x27;Werksturbo&#x27; model capable of . Based on the 3.0 S, this derivative featured widened Series X bodywork, front and rear &#x27;Ford Motorsport&#x27; badged spoilers, deep 7.5j four-spoked RS alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli P7 235/60VR13 tyres and an RS badged engine. The engine was based on a normally aspirated carburetor equipped 2.8-litre Cologne V6, Ford Granada (Europe) engine using electronic ignition, a Tufftrided crankshaft, heavy duty head gaskets and oil pump, an oil cooler and a single Garrett T4 turbocharger providing 5.4 psi of boost, a limited slip differential, Bilstein dampers all around, an anti dive kit, uprated RS anti roll bars and single rear leaf springs, the engine put out 188 Hp at 5500 rpm. Figures of around 200 produced examples are common, but numbered transmission tunnels possibly indicate 155 conversions were made.

====Tickford Turbo====
The Tickford Capri used a turbocharged 2.8 Injection Cologne engine which developed , allowing it to reach 60 miles per hour in 6.7 seconds and 100 miles per hour in 18.5 seconds, topping out at 137 miles per hour. This version also featured a luxury interior with optional full leather retrim and Wilton carpeting and headlining, large rear spoiler, colour-coded front grille, deeper bumpers and &#x27;one off&#x27; bodykit designed by Simon Saunders, later of KAT Designs and now designer of the Ariel Atom.

Rear disc brakes were standard on the Tickford, which featured numerous other suspension modifications. This model was essentially rebuilt by hand by Tickford at approximately 200 hours per car. It sold only 80 units. One problem was the relative price difference to the standard Capri Injection, with the Tickford version costing twice as much.

What is thought to be the last Capri registered in the UK is a white Tickford registered on 11 September 1991 with the registration number J4AJA.

====Turbo Technics conversions====
Independent tuner Turbo Technics also released a turbocharged and evolution which came supplied with a specially built gearbox. The Tickford Capri pricing issues meant that Ford also sanctioned the Turbo Technics conversion as semi-official, although only the German RS and British Tickford ever appeared in Ford literature as official Ford products.

====Capri Laser====

From November 1984 onwards, the Capri was sold only in Britain, with only right hand drive cars being made from this date. The normally aspirated 1.6 and 2.0 variants were rebranded with a new trim level – &quot;Lasers&quot; – which featured a fully populated instrument pod, leather gear lever, leather steering wheel, four-spoke alloy wheels as used on the S models, an electric aerial and colour-coded grille and mirrors.

The very last Laser Capri came off the line in November 1986, painted in a unique &quot;Mercury Grey&quot; colour. This car was registered on 8 May 1987 in Sussex and is to be found in a collection of classic cars in Gillingham, Kent.

====Capri 280====
The last run limited edition Capri 280, nicknamed &quot;Brooklands&quot; referring to the name of the particular shade of green that all Capri 280 models were painted in, featured a limited slip differential, full leather Recaro interior and Pirelli Cinturato P7 tyres, 15 inch versions of the seven spoke 13 inch wheels fitted to the superseded Capri Injection Special. Ford originally intended to make 500 turbocharged vehicles (by Turbo Technics) complete with gold alloy wheels and name it the Capri 500 but a change of production planning meant a name change to Capri 280 as the cars were simply the last models that ran down the production line. A total of 1,038 Capri 280s were built. There was no direct successor to the Capri, as Ford felt that there was not adequate demand for a car of this type in Europe to justify a direct replacement; Capri sales had been declining since 1980, with faster versions of more practical hatchbacks and saloons becoming popular at the expense of sports cars. British Leyland, for instance, had taken the decision not to replace its MG and Triumph sports cars on their demise at the beginning of the 1980s due to falling popularity, instead concentrating on mostly MG-badged versions of hatchbacks and saloons like the Metro and Montego, while Ford had enjoyed strong sales of its faster versions of the Fiesta, Escort and Sierra in the run-up to the Capri&#x27;s demise.


When the last Capri was made on 19 December 1986 at the Ford factory in Cologne, 1,886,647 Capris had rolled off the production lines.

The last Capri made (registered as D194 UVW) still exists today, and is owned by Ford&#x27;s heritage workshop. The &quot;Brooklands&quot; models had a steep price tag of around £12,000 and struggled to sell. Sales continued through 1987 and 1988, with the last 280 being registered on 20 November 1989 (registration mark G749 NGP) making it also the only G-reg Capri, and the next-to-last Capri to have been registered – though it is estimated that there are 3 Capri 280s that have never been registered, one of them being a 230 HP Turbo Technics conversion, and two standard cars. Production had ended at Halewood, UK in 1976 and the Capri was made exclusively in Germany from 1976 to 1986. More than a million Mk Is were sold in Europe, the UK and North America. The Mk IIs continued to be sold in Europe, the UK and North America, though in smaller numbers and the Mk IIIs were only exported outside Europe/UK (to Asia and New Zealand) in limited numbers.

====Engines====

===Police use===

Throughout its production run, Ford Capris were operated by the traffic divisions of some police forces in the United Kingdom. A fleet of Mk.I 3000 GT Capris were first introduced to the Lancashire Constabulary in 1971, with further examples entering service with police forces in Merseyside, Sussex, the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland and Strathclyde Police in Scotland. Most notably, Ford Capris were operated extensively in the traffic division of Greater Manchester Police, as well as its predecessor Manchester and Salford Police. High-performance Capris were delivered to the force from 1971 until 1986, when a final fleet of Mk.III 2.8 Injection Capris were delivered. Greater Manchester Police eventually retired their last Mk.III 2.8i Capri in 1992, being replaced by a Ford Sierra Sapphire Cosworth. Mk.1 Ford Capris 2300 GTs were also operated by Autobahnpolizei in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, with four entering service in Hilden in 1969.

==Outside Europe==

===North America===

====Capri====

From 1970 to 1978, the Capri was sold in North America through Ford&#x27;s Lincoln-Mercury Division. All were German-produced. Headlamps were four round sealed-beams (shared with the Capri RS3000), and turn signal lamps were grille-mounted on all US-spec 1971–74 Capris and 1976–78 Capri IIs. Full instrumentation wasn&#x27;t available on 1971–72 four-cylinder models but was made standard equipment from 1973 on. An optional interior decor package, changed by name to the &quot;Ghia&quot; package for the Capri II, featured deluxe interior trim and features. 1973 Ford Capris were the Mk I face-lift models featuring the new grille, larger taillights and new interior and dash. The 1973 model had the federally mandated 2.5 mph front bumper for &#x27;73. The bumper was extended, the gap closed with a silver filler panel. 1974 models had larger bumpers front and rear with wraparound urethane, body-color bumper covers to meet the revised Federal front and rear 5 mph standard. 1976–78 models were the re-designed hatchback models offered worldwide since 1974, fitted with the grille-mounted turn signal lamps and the required round sealed-beam headlamps, 5 mph body-color bumpers and catalytic converter, requiring no-lead fuel. In 1976, an &#x27;S&#x27; (JPS) special edition featured black or white paint with gold-coloured wheels, gold pin-striping, and upgraded two-tone interior in beige and black. Due to late production of Capri IIs, there were no 1975 models sold in the US (Lincoln-Mercury dealerships had an inventory of leftover 1974 models during the 1975 model year as seen on TV advertisements). Unlike the European market where the Capri was available in several trim levels and marketed as the equivalent of a Grand Touring automobile, the US/Canada market Capris were marketed as a compact sports car.
Originally, Cologne-built Capris imported to North America were fitted only with the British 1600 OHV (1.6 L), Kent engine with the four-speed manual transmission. The 1971 Capri offered the Kent-built 1600 I4 and the optional, Cologne-built OHC 2000 (2.0 L) I4 engine for improved performance with . An optional three-speed automatic transmission (a Ford Cruise-o-Matic C4, also shared with the Pinto) was made available with the 2000 I4 engine. In 1972–73, the 2000 I4 became the standard engine, and an OHV 2600 (2.6 L) Cologne V6 was optional, which produced . The 1600 I4 was dropped. For 1974, new engines were used—the OHC 2300 (2.3 L) I4 and OHV 2800 (2.8 L) Cologne V6; producing and respectively. The engines were carried over for the 1976–77 Capri ll hatchback models, although the V6&#x27;s power had crept up to at 4,800 rpm. The last Capris were brought in 1977 although sales continued into 1978. Capri sales had slid considerably by the time of the introduction of the Capri II, and the high price contributed to ending sales of German-built Capris in the US.

In 1979, no longer importing the Ford Capri, but capitalising on the model&#x27;s positive image, Mercury dealers began selling a new Capri that was a restyled derivative of the Fox-bodied Ford Mustang and was produced until 1986. Mercury introduced yet another Capri in 1990, but this was the Australian produced, Mazda-based, 2+2 seat, front-wheel drive convertible.

===Australia===
====Mk I (1969–1972)====
The Ford Motor Company of Australia assembled the European-designed Capri Mk.1 at its plant in the Sydney suburb of Homebush from March, 1969 until November, 1972. The Capri was offered in the Australian market from 3 May 1969, as the 1600 Deluxe and the 1600 GT, using the 1.6-litre Kent OHV engine. On 25 February 1970, the 3000 GT was launched, equipped with the 3.0-litre Essex V6. At the same time the 1600 GT became the 1600 XL, while the 1600 Deluxe remained unchanged.

In November 1972, production of the Capri ended in Australia, with a total of 14,638 vehicles having been assembled. In June/July, 1974, Ford Australia imported fifty RS3100 models. Ford Australia also imported four examples of the Capri II (Mk.2), albeit for show purposes only. Neither the Mk.1 facelift (except the RS3100) Capri nor the subsequent Mk.2 and Mk.3 models were produced or officially sold in Australia (though they were heavily involved in Australian motorsport and many have been privately imported). Ford Australia concentrated its sales efforts on other UK sourced products, namely the Escort and Cortina sedans.

====SA30 (1989–1994)====
From 1989 to 1994 Ford Australia reused the Capri name for an unrelated two-door convertible sports car, coded the SA30. The new model was exported to the United States, where it was marketed as the Mercury Capri. A small portion were sold in Australia.

===South Africa===
Ford of South Africa assembled the Capri from 1970 to late 1972 with a similar model range to the UK. No facelift models or RS variants were marketed in South Africa. The Essex V6 was the most common engine, as it was assembled locally – the Pinto &quot;four&quot; was not installed. The 1600 four and three-litre V6 were also available.

About 500 Capris were converted by specialist Basil Green Motors to run the 302 Ford Windsor V8 engine. These models were known as the Capri Perana and were very successful in local touring car events, winning the 1970 South African championship and, in a different format, the 1971 championship as well.

No Mk II and Mk III Capris were exported to, or built in South Africa.

==Motorsport==

===Zakspeed Ford Capri===

A Group 5 version of the Capri Mk III was built by Zakspeed to compete in the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft motor racing series. Klaus Ludwig subsequently won the 1981 title. The car retained very little of the Capri. Only the roof, pillars and parts of the rear end remained. The body mainly consisted of aluminium profiles and 80 metres of aluminium tubing. The turbocharged Cosworth engine puts out approximately at 9200 rpm with 1.4 bar charge; 1.6 bars were available for short periods for an extra .
== Revival ==
At the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show, Ford unveiled the Visos concept. The two door coupe took numerous styling cues from the Capri.

In 2009, it was reported that a new Capri model was being developed. The car was supposedly a two door hatchback based on the Focus, fitted with a 1.6-litre Ecoboost engine and aimed at competing with the Volkswagen Scirocco and Renault Mégane RS market. The car was never produced.

In early 2023, there was speculation that Ford could revive the Capri nameplate in Europe as an electric sports crossover coupe, similar to the revival of the Puma nameplate in 2019. Though the Capri name has not been confirmed by Ford, instead being named the &quot;Sport Crossover&quot; prior to an official launch in 2024, the vehicle would be based on the Volkswagen Group MEB platform and would share technology and design cues from the 2024 Ford Explorer EV. A camouflaged pre-production vehicle would later be photographed driving around Cologne in November 2023, and it was unveiled on July 10, 2024.

<text>Gary Albert Filmon (born August 24, 1942) is a Canadian politician from Manitoba who served as the 19th premier of Manitoba. He was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba from 1983 to 2000, and served as the premier from 1988 to 1999.

==Early life==
Gary Albert Filmon was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to working-class parents, and is of Romanian and Polish-Ukrainian background. His Romanian father anglicized the family name from &quot;Filimon&quot; to &quot;Filmon&quot; when he emigrated westward to Canada.

Filmon was educated at the University of Manitoba and subsequently worked as a civil engineer. In 1963, he married Janice Wainwright.

==Political career==

===Municipal politics===

Filmon entered public life in 1975, being elected to the Winnipeg City Council; for the next four years, Filmon was a member of Winnipeg&#x27;s Independent Citizens&#x27; Election Committee, an unofficial alliance of centre-right Liberal and Progressive Conservative interests in the city.

===Provincial politics===

In 1979, Filmon won a by-election to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the riding of River Heights, held after the resignation of former Tory leader Sidney Spivak. On January 16, 1981, Filmon was appointed Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Minister of Environment in the government of Sterling Lyon.

Lyon&#x27;s Tories were defeated later in 1981 by the New Democratic Party under Howard Pawley, though Filmon was re-elected in the new riding of Tuxedo. He was elected to replace Lyon as party leader in 1983, defeating Brian Ransom and Clayton Manness at a delegated convention. At the time, Filmon was considered to be on the party&#x27;s progressive wing. Supporters of Ransom would later allege that Filmon&#x27;s campaign team had sponsored Manness&#x27; candidacy as a means of splitting the conservative vote.

Filmon&#x27;s Tories narrowly lost the 1986 election, winning 26 seats against 30 for the NDP. This election was generally regarded as lacking in defining issues, and the two major parties were not seen as having many ideological divisions between them.

==== Premiership ====
Howard Pawley&#x27;s slender majority government fell in 1988 when disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding broke ranks and joined the opposition to vote down Pawley&#x27;s budget. In the subsequent election, the Manitoba Liberal Party rose from one seat to twenty, taking seats away from both the Tories and the NDP in the process. The NDP, led by Gary Doer (Pawley had resigned after the writs were dropped), fell to 12 seats and third place. The Tories dropped to 25 seats, but nevertheless emerged as the largest party in the legislature. Filmon himself was almost defeated by a Liberal candidate in Tuxedo; but he survived by 123 votes. After the NDP agreed to tolerate a PC minority government, Filmon became Premier.

The 1988-1990 parliament was most notable for its debates on the Meech Lake Accord, which would have confirmed the distinct status of Quebec within Canada. The Pawley government had supported this initiative, but Filmon was initially opposed to it, and the Manitoba assembly refused to ratify the treaty (rather to the embarrassment of federal Tory Prime Minister Brian Mulroney). Filmon eventually agreed to a compromise deal negotiated by Jean Charest in 1990. However, he was a lukewarm supporter of the compromise at best, and it came to nothing when New Democratic MLA Elijah Harper refused to grant unanimous consent for debate before the bill&#x27;s deadline. (Harper objected to the fact that the Accord did not recognize the rights of Indigenous peoples.)

In other matters, Filmon was closer to the policies of the Mulroney government. He supported the 1987 free trade initiative, and worked in favour of the Charlottetown Accord (a successor to Meech Lake) in 1992.

Filmon called an election in 1990, and campaigned on the need for a majority government. Despite the increased unpopularity of the Mulroney government at the federal level, Filmon&#x27;s Tories were able to win over many voters who had supported the Liberals in 1988. His party won thirty seats, and the NDP re-emerged as the official opposition with twenty.

While not an ideological conservative in the tradition of Margaret Thatcher, Filmon nonetheless presided over an austerity program of budget cuts. His government&#x27;s measures resulted in a balanced budget in 1995, the province&#x27;s first in 20 years. Filmon also permitted suburban regions to break away from the amalgamated city of Winnipeg, reversing the policies initiated by the Edward Schreyer government in the early 1970s. In 1993, Filmon supported Kim Campbell&#x27;s bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (&quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, 13 June 1993).

Despite government cuts to social programs and urban development, Filmon&#x27;s Tories were able to retain their majority in 1995, losing only one seat. This was due in part to the unpopularity of Bob Rae&#x27;s NDP government in neighbouring Ontario, and concerns that the Manitoba NDP would govern in a similar manner under Doer if elected. Subsequently, the Filmon government privatized the province&#x27;s telephone system, mandated balanced budgets, and took actions limiting the power of teacher&#x27;s and nurse&#x27;s unions. While Filmon avoided the rhetoric of Ontario Premier Mike Harris (1995–2002), there were nevertheless strong similarities to the reforms instituted by these governments in the late 1990s.

In the late 1990s, the reputation of the Filmon government was damaged by a scandal involving vote-rigging in the 1995 election. A number of independent &quot;aboriginal issues&quot; candidates were alleged to have been commissioned by Progressive Conservative organizers to run in NDP ridings under the banner of Independent Native Voice in an attempt to split the left-of-centre vote. Filmon was not personally implicated, but a number of his senior aides were. Manitoba also experienced increased unemployment during this period, with Filmon&#x27;s popularity suffering as a result.

Notwithstanding these setbacks, Filmon sought a fourth mandate in late 1999. During this campaign, he announced that his government would undertake a further right-wing policy shift if re-elected. He promised half a billion dollars in new tax cuts, while claiming that he could simultaneously re-invest an identical amount into health and education. This announcement was greeted with skepticism from many voters, and the Tories lost to Doer&#x27;s NDP by 32 seats to 24 (the Liberals were reduced to one seat, as many Liberal voters from 1995 shifted to the NDP). Filmon resigned as party leader in 2000, and stood down as an MLA in the same year.

==Post-political career==

Filmon was appointed to the federal Security Intelligence Review Committee on October 4, 2001, which necessitated an appointment to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. He was promoted to chair of SIRC on June 24, 2005 following the retirement of Paule Gauthier.

Filmon has also worked as a business consultant since his retirement from office. In 2003, he was commissioned by the government of British Columbia to undertake a survey of forest fires in that province. On June 22, 2005, at the Annual General Meeting of the Exchange Industrial Income Fund (EIF.UN-X), Filmon was elected as the chairman of the board of trustees for the ensuing year. Filmon sat on the board of directors of Manitoba&#x27;s public telephone utility, MTS, from 2003 until his mandatory retirement in 2015.

In February 2006, Filmon was considered to replace Frank McKenna as Canadian Ambassador to the United States. In the end, Michael Wilson was appointed to this post.

In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to public office and to the province of Manitoba, as well as for his continuing leadership on numerous provincial and national boards, committees and organizations&quot;.

He is married to Janice Filmon, who was lieutenant governor of Manitoba from 2015 to 2022. For the duration of his spouse&#x27;s term in that office, Gary Filmon was styled &quot;His Honour&quot;.

<doc id="546610" wikidata="Q2348561" url="?curid=546610" title="Rhins of Galloway">
<text>The Rhins (or Rhinns) of Galloway is a double-headed peninsula in southwestern Scotland. It takes the form of a hammerhead projecting into the Irish Sea, terminating in the north at Corsewall and Milleur Points and in the south at the Mull of Galloway (the southernmost point of Scotland). It is connected to the rest of Wigtownshire by an isthmus, washed on the north by Loch Ryan and on the south by Luce Bay. From end to end, the peninsula measures . It takes its name from the Gaelic word &quot;rinn&quot;, meaning &quot;point&quot;.

The principal settlements are Stranraer at the head of Loch Ryan and the small tourist village of Portpatrick on the west coast. Other villages are dotted up and down the peninsula, including Kirkcolm, Leswalt, Lochans, and, in the South Rhins, Stoneykirk, Sandhead, Ardwell, and Drummore.

==Geography and climate==

The peninsula is bounded on its west coast by the North Channel and Loch Ryan and Luce Bay in the east. With around 50 miles (80 km) of coastline running from Stranraer in the north to Torrs Warren in the south, the sea heavily influences the land. The coastal landscape varies: the west coast has steep, rugged cliffs and occasional inlets, but the calmer eastern coast has sandy beaches and a softer landscape.

The Rhins are exposed to the westerlies from the Atlantic and thus receive a lot of rainfall (around per year); this has led to the peninsula being principally used for farming, with the relatively flat land offering good dairy and beef production. As the land is almost surrounded by sea, its temperature is significantly stabilised by the North Atlantic drift, which cools the land in summer and warms it in winter. Thus there are few severe frosts. This allows the survival of numerous tropical palms and flora which otherwise could not exist this far north. Examples of these tropical plants can be seen at the Logan Botanic Garden.

The natural geography of the Rhins has led directly to the use of the area for development: the entire peninsula acts as a huge breakwater against the currents of the North Channel and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic. This creates relatively calm and safe navigable waters in Loch Ryan and Luce Bay. They are notably used by the ferries that sail to Belfast and Larne, which were originally based at Portpatrick. As the ships became larger, they required larger protective harbours, and the exposed Portpatrick was no longer suitable, so they moved to the shelter of Loch Ryan from where they still sail today.

The southernmost point of the Rhins is also the southernmost point in Scotland, the Mull of Galloway. Here the land and rocky cliffs support a diverse range of animals and plants, with the Mull area designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and also an RSPB nature reserve. Razorbills, guillemots, and puffins are three bird species that nest on the cliffs.

The land narrows significantly north of the Mull, south of Rhins, forming an isthmus dividing two bays (the East and West Tarbets). In ancient times boats were brought ashore and moved across the isthmus [] by human resources, with the aid of log rollers and lubrication—all this effort aimed to avoid navigating around the Mull with its dangerous currents.

The Southern Upland Way begins in the Rhins at Portpatrick and winds its way through the area on its long journey east across Scotland to its finish at Cockburnspath.

==History and settlements==
In the South Rhins the Britons were commemorated by the name of a farm, Drumbreddan, &quot;the ridge of the Britons&quot;. Their chieftains lived in hill-forts, like that of Dunman, &quot;fort of gables&quot;, Kirkmaiden, above sea level; some in drystone brochs, like Doon Castle at Ardwell Point. They built substantial fortifications, like the one between East and West Tarbet, which defends the Mull of Galloway against marauders from the north.

Having been settled from ancient times, the area has a long history, forming part of the western kingdoms that collectively ruled most of western Scotland, parts of Ireland and the Isle of Man. The Novantae Celtic tribe was based in the Rhins area, which the Romans called &quot;Novantarum Peninsula&quot;. When Agricola was in Britain in 81 AD, a road was built from Dalswinton west to the Rhins, terminating at Stranraer on the southwestern tip of Loch Ryan, leading some to argue that if Agricola did attack Ireland, he would have done so from this location.

Subsistence, Crofting, lifestyles are likely to have been dominant throughout much of the peninsula&#x27;s history. Farming would have been practised to satisfy the needs of the tenants and, later on, the estates. Fishing would have generally been practised on a local scale for local consumption rather than export. Due to the very sparse populations that lived in the area it was not until the Industrial Revolution that changes from a basic subsistence crofting lifestyle would be noted.

Resources in the area were traditionally used locally and increasingly exported. Salt Pans on the western coast of the peninsula were used for centuries as a local source of salt. Kelp harvesting became increasingly popular, both for local uses and also exported for use in chemical production. Sands, silts and gravels, common to all glaciated alluvial areas were frequently quarried.

As communications improved the wealth of the area improved, with the sea links to Ireland, Glasgow &amp; Liverpool both allowing the export of local farming produce (thus encouraging farming for production rather than subsistence) and also import of materials and goods not common to the area. The importance of the area&#x27;s proximity to Ireland led to significant infrastructure being developed, most notably the link to the railway network, which was laid to Portpatrick to ensure a fast passage for the mail boat to Donaghadee. As the ships which served the North Channel route increased in size it became more difficult for Portpatrick to offer a safe harbour, with the shipping routes eventually moving in 1849 to the calmer waters of Stranraer Harbour in Loch Ryan.

During the Second World War the area became an important station for anti-U-boat activities, with flying boats operating from the Loch side of the peninsula at RAF Station Wig Bay, as well as RAF Station Stranraer. RAF Corsewall operated north of Kirkcolm and was mainly used as a training school for flying boats. The bombing range in Luce Bay was used extensively throughout the second world war, with facilities based at West Freugh and Drummore

In modern times the peninsula consists of a patchwork of farms running the full length of the land. Increasingly the area is diversifying into tourism as small scale farming becomes less economically viable. The natural environment of the area, with its long rugged coastline and numerous small bays attracts some tourism. The relatively sparse population is also a key asset, in a time when many tourist locations are suffering over-popularity. The natural environment of the area saw the BBC deciding to film the drama Two Thousand Acres of Sky in the village of Port Logan.

Sites of interest in and around the Rhins include:

*Corsewall Lighthouse, sitting at the northern end of the peninsula, it is now a four star hotel
*Lochnaw Castle near Leswalt which is the ancestral seat of Clan Agnew
*West Freugh RAF station near Stoneykirk which was (and to a lesser extent still is) used by the RAF as an airfield for bombing target practice out in Luce Bay
*Dunskey Castle near Portpatrick, built in the 16th century by the Adairs of Kilhilt, with now only the remains remaining
*Port Logan village, where the BBC drama Two Thousand Acres of Sky was filmed, and the nearby Logan outstation of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh.
*Ardwell House &amp; Gardens near Ardwell, the estate house and gardens of Ardwell estates
*Kirkmadrine Stones near Sandhead, earliest Christian activity on the peninsula, with the site established in the 5th century.
*The Mull of Galloway, lighthouse and RSPB nature reserve

<text>In nuclear physics, a magic number is a number of nucleons (either protons or neutrons, separately) such that they are arranged into complete shells within the atomic nucleus. As a result, atomic nuclei with a &quot;magic&quot; number of protons or neutrons are much more stable than other nuclei. The seven most widely recognized magic numbers as of 2019 are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126.

For protons, this corresponds to the elements helium, oxygen, calcium, nickel, tin, lead, and the hypothetical unbihexium, although 126 is so far only known to be a magic number for neutrons. Atomic nuclei consisting of such a magic number of nucleons have a higher average binding energy per nucleon than one would expect based upon predictions such as the semi-empirical mass formula and are hence more stable against nuclear decay. 

The unusual stability of isotopes having magic numbers means that transuranium elements could theoretically be created with extremely large nuclei and yet not be subject to the extremely rapid radioactive decay normally associated with high atomic numbers. Large isotopes with magic numbers of nucleons are said to exist in an island of stability. Unlike the magic numbers 2–126, which are realized in spherical nuclei, theoretical calculations predict that nuclei in the island of stability are deformed.

Before this was realized, higher magic numbers, such as 184, 258, 350, and 462, were predicted based on simple calculations that assumed spherical shapes: these are generated by the formula formula_1 (see Binomial coefficient). It is now believed that the sequence of spherical magic numbers cannot be extended in this way. Further predicted magic numbers are 114, 122, 124, and 164 for protons as well as 184, 196, 236, and 318 for neutrons. However, more modern calculations predict 228 and 308 for neutrons, along with 184 and 196.

==History and etymology==

While working on the Manhattan Project, the German physicist Maria Goeppert Mayer became interested in the properties of nuclear fission products, such as decay energies and half-lives. In 1948, she published a body of experimental evidence for the occurrence of closed nuclear shells for nuclei with 50 or 82 protons or 50, 82, and 126 neutrons. 

It had already been known that nuclei with 20 protons or neutrons were stable: that was evidenced by calculations by Hungarian-American physicist Eugene Wigner, one of her colleagues in the Manhattan Project. Two years later, in 1950, a new publication followed in which she attributed the shell closures at the magic numbers to spin-orbit coupling. According to Steven Moszkowski, a student of Goeppert Mayer, the term &quot;magic number&quot; was coined by Wigner: &quot;Wigner too believed in the liquid drop model, but he recognized, from the work of Maria Mayer, the very strong evidence for the closed shells. It seemed a little like magic to him, and that is how the words &#x27;Magic Numbers&#x27; were coined.&quot;

These magic numbers were the bedrock of the nuclear shell model, which Mayer developed in the following years together with Hans Jensen and culminated in their shared 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==Doubly magic==
Nuclei which have neutron numbers and proton (atomic) numbers both equal to one of the magic numbers are called &quot;doubly magic&quot;, and are generally very stable against decay. The known doubly magic isotopes are helium-4, helium-10, oxygen-16, calcium-40, calcium-48, nickel-48, nickel-56, nickel-78, tin-100, tin-132, and lead-208. While only helium-4, oxygen-16, calcium-40, and lead-208 are completely stable, calcium-48 is extremely long-lived and therefore found naturally, disintegrating only by a very inefficient double beta minus decay process. Double beta decay in general is so rare that several nuclides exist which are predicted to decay by this mechanism but in which no such decay has yet been observed. Even in nuclides whose double beta decay has been confirmed through observations, half lives usually exceed the age of the universe by orders of magnitude, and emitted beta or gamma radiation is for virtually all practical purposes irrelevant. On the other hand, helium-10 is extremely unstable, and has a half-life of just ().

Doubly magic effects may allow the existence of stable isotopes which otherwise would not have been expected. An example is calcium-40, with 20 neutrons and 20 protons, which is the heaviest stable isotope made of the same number of protons and neutrons. Both calcium-48 and nickel-48 are doubly magic because calcium-48 has 20 protons and 28 neutrons while nickel-48 has 28 protons and 20 neutrons. Calcium-48 is very neutron-rich for such a relatively light element, but like calcium-40, it is stabilized by being doubly magic. As an exception, although oxygen-28 has 8 protons and 20 neutrons, it is unbound with respect to four-neutron decay and appears to lack closed neutron shells, so it is not regarded as doubly magic.

Magic number shell effects are seen in ordinary abundances of elements: helium-4 is among the most abundant (and stable) nuclei in the universe and lead-208 is the heaviest stable nuclide (at least by known experimental observations). Alpha decay (the emission of a 4He nucleus – also known as an alpha particle – by a heavy element undergoing radioactive decay) is common in part due to the extraordinary stability of helium-4, which makes this type of decay energetically favored in most heavy nuclei over neutron emission, proton emission or any other type of cluster decay. The stability of 4He also leads to the absence of stable isobars of mass number 5 and 8; indeed, all nuclides of those mass numbers decay within fractions of a second to produce alpha particles.

Magic effects can keep unstable nuclides from decaying as rapidly as would otherwise be expected. For example, the nuclides tin-100 and tin-132 are examples of doubly magic isotopes of tin that are unstable, and represent endpoints beyond which stability drops off rapidly. Nickel-48, discovered in 1999, is the most proton-rich doubly magic nuclide known. At the other extreme, nickel-78 is also doubly magic, with 28 protons and 50 neutrons, a ratio observed only in much heavier elements, apart from tritium with one proton and two neutrons (78Ni: 28/50 = 0.56; 238U: 92/146 = 0.63).

In December 2006, hassium-270, with 108 protons and 162 neutrons, was discovered by an international team of scientists led by the Technical University of Munich, having a half-life of 9 seconds. Hassium-270 evidently forms part of an island of stability, and may even be doubly magic due to the deformed (American football- or rugby ball-like) shape of this nucleus.

Although &quot;Z&quot; = 92 and &quot;N&quot; = 164 are not magic numbers, the undiscovered neutron-rich nucleus uranium-256 may be doubly magic and spherical due to the difference in size between low- and high-angular momentum orbitals, which alters the shape of the nuclear potential.

==Derivation==
Magic numbers are typically obtained by empirical studies; if the form of the nuclear potential is known, then the Schrödinger equation can be solved for the motion of nucleons and energy levels determined. Nuclear shells are said to occur when the separation between energy levels is significantly greater than the local mean separation.

In the shell model for the nucleus, magic numbers are the numbers of nucleons at which a shell is filled. For instance, the magic number 8 occurs when the 1s1/2, 1p3/2, 1p1/2 energy levels are filled, as there is a large energy gap between the 1p1/2 and the next highest 1d5/2 energy levels.

The atomic analog to nuclear magic numbers are those numbers of electrons leading to discontinuities in the ionization energy. These occur for the noble gases helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon and oganesson. Hence, the &quot;atomic magic numbers&quot; are 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86 and 118. As with the nuclear magic numbers, these are expected to be changed in the superheavy region due to spin/orbit-coupling effects affecting subshell energy levels. Hence copernicium (112) and flerovium (114) are expected to be more inert than oganesson (118), and the next noble gas after these is expected to occur at element 172 rather than 168 (which would continue the pattern).

In 2010, an alternative explanation of magic numbers was given in terms of symmetry considerations. Based on the fractional extension of the standard rotation group, the ground state properties (including the magic numbers) for metallic clusters and nuclei were simultaneously determined analytically. A specific potential term is not necessary in this model.

<text>Alloway (, ) is a suburb of Ayr, and former village, in South Ayrshire, Scotland, located on the River Doon. It is best known as the birthplace of Robert Burns and the setting for his poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;. Tobias Bachope, the mason responsible for the construction of Hopetoun House, Craigiehall, and Kinross House, also hailed from Alloway. Some historic parts of the village make up a conservation area.

A former village in its own right, Alloway and its surrounding areas were incorporated into the Royal Burgh of Ayr in 1935, and the extended village is now a suburb of Ayr.

==Robert Burns==
 
The birthplace of Robert Burns, known as &quot;Burns Cottage&quot;, is located in Alloway, now adjacent to a museum containing original manuscripts of his poetry. A 19th-century memorial to Burns, designed by Thomas Hamilton, is located at the foot of the village next to the present church.

The nearby ruined Alloway Auld Kirk and the Brig o&#x27; Doon are featured in the poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;, and are presently tourist attractions. Burns&#x27;s father, William Burnes, is buried in the Auld Kirk. To add a &quot;ghostly&quot; appearance to the place, green lights are illuminated over it at night.

The whole site relating to Burns, encompassing Burns Cottage, the Brig o&#x27; Doon, Alloway Auld Kirk, the old and new museum buildings, the Burns Monument and relevant local landmarks, is maintained by the National Trust for Scotland as the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum.

==Points of interest==
===Facilities===
Alloway has a primary school, library, post office, general store, church, pharmacy, museum, tearoom and gift shop.

===Church===
The Alloway Auld Kirk having been a ruin since the end of the 18th century, a new church was opened for worship on 10 October 1858 and the first minister was called in 1859. As originally built, the new church was rectangular. Modifications in 1878 and 1890 created the present shape. The suite of halls beyond the churchyard was erected in 1965, the session house in 1977 and the octagonal hall in 1987. The minister (since 1999) is the Reverend Neil A. McNaught.

===Public parks===
There are two main parks in Alloway. The first, Rozelle, hosts the Ayr Flower Show each summer and has an art gallery which holds various exhibitions throughout the year. Rozelle also maintains a permanent sculpture collection, including a Henry Moore and a series of granite carvings by Ronald Rae. The second, Belleisle Park, houses two golf courses, walled garden, Camelia House, and a playground.

===Newark Estate===
Newark Estate is a pheasant and partridge game shooting estate immediately to the south of Alloway. It has been owned by the Walker family for at least three generations, their family grave being prominent in the churchyard of Alloway Parish Church.

==Sport==
Cambusdoon New Ground is located in Alloway on the former Robertson&#x27;s Field, and has hosted a number of Scotland Cricket Internationals. It is also the home of the Ayr Cricket Club, founded in 1859. Ayr Cricket Club has been at Cambusdoon since 1996, when they moved across the road from the original Cambusdoon ground. Ayr Cricket Club moved from the Dam Park to the original Cambusdoon ground in 1935; it remained their home for 60 years until it was sold for housing in 1995. The original cricket ground, which hosted two first-class matches (Scotland vs. Ireland in 1958 and 1974), was developed on the grounds of the former Cambusdoon Estate, once owned by 19th-century iron and coal magnate James Baird. Baird&#x27;s original Cambusdoon House, now a ruin, was converted to a boys&#x27; preparatory school in the late 1920s, and the rest of the estate surrounding the cricket ground was developed for housing in the late 1930s. Former England cricket captain Mike Denness grew up in one of the houses on Shanter Way, which adjoined the cricket ground.

Ayr Hockey Club also play out of the Cambusdoon ground, on a purpose-built floodlit astroturf pitch, which is also used for 5-a-side and 11-a-side football. There is also a bowling green, with the Cricket Club, Hockey Club and Bowling Club being held under the Cambusdoon Sports Club title.

Millbrae, the home of Ayr Rugby Club since 1964, is also located in Alloway.

==Notable residents==
*Robert Burns, the considered the national poet of Scotland, was born in Alloway.
*Very Rev Samuel Marcus Dill DD was minister of Alloway 1881 to 1913. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1912.

<text>Uncapping, in the context of cable modems, refers to a number of activities performed to alter an Internet service provider&#x27;s modem settings. It is sometimes done for the sake of bandwidth (i.e. by buying a 512 kbit/s access modem and then altering it to 10 Mbit/s), pluggable interfaces (as by using more than one public ID), or any configurable options a DOCSIS modem can offer. However, uncapping may be considered an illegal activity, such as theft of service.

== Methods ==
There are several methods used to uncap a cable modem, by hardware, software, tricks, alterations, and modifications.

One of the most popular modifications is used on Motorola modems (such as the SB3100, SB4100, and SB4200 models); by spoofing the Internet service provider&#x27;s TFTP server, the modem is made to accept a different configuration file than the one provided by the TFTP server. This configuration file tells the modem the download and upload caps it should enforce. An example of spoofing would be to edit the configuration file, which requires a DOCSIS editor, or replacing the configuration file with one obtained from a faster modem (e.g. through a Gnutella network). 

An alternate method employs DHCPforce. By flooding a modem with faked DHCP packets (which contain configuration filename, TFTP, IP, etc.), one can convince the modem to accept any desired configuration file, even one from one&#x27;s own server (provided the server is routed, of course).

Another more advanced method is to attach a TTL to the modem&#x27;s RS-232 adapter, and get access to the modem&#x27;s console directly to make it download new firmware, which can then be configured via a simple web interface. Examples include SIGMA, a firmware add-on that expands the current features of an underlying firmware, and others.
