<text>The Box Tops is an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee in 1967. They are best known for the hits &quot;The Letter&quot;, &quot;Cry Like a Baby&quot;, and &quot;Soul Deep&quot; and are considered a major blue-eyed soul group of the period. They performed a mixture of current soul music songs by artists such as James &amp; Bobby Purify and Clifford Curry; pop tunes like &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; by Procol Harum; and songs written by their producers, Dan Penn, Spooner Oldham, and Chips Moman. Vocalist Alex Chilton later fronted the power pop band Big Star and performed as a solo artist.

The Box Tops&#x27; music combined elements of soul music and light pop. Their records are prime examples of the styles made popular by Moman and Penn at American Sound Studio in Memphis. Many of their lesser known Top 40 hits, including &quot;Neon Rainbow&quot;, &quot;I Met Her in Church&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Cream Ladies, Forward March&quot;, are considered minor classics. As rock critic Lester Bangs wrote in a review of the group&#x27;s &quot;Super Hits&quot; album, &quot;A song like &#x27;Soul Deep&#x27; is obvious enough, a patented commercial sound, yet within these strictures it communicates with a depth and sincerity of feeling that holds the attention and brings you back often.&quot;

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years as The Devilles ===
The Box Tops began as The Devilles, playing in Memphis. By January 1967 the group was composed of founding member Danny Smythe (drums, background vocal) along with newer arrivals John Evans (guitar, keyboards, background vocal), Alex Chilton (lead vocal, guitar), Bill Cunningham (bass guitar, keyboards, background vocal; son of Sun Records artist Buddy Blake Cunningham and brother of B.B. Cunningham Jr., lead vocalist for 1960s Memphis group The Hombres); and Gary Talley (lead guitar, electric sitar, bass, background vocal). They soon changed their name to The Box Tops to prevent confusion with another band who was recording at the time, The DeVilles of New York.

=== &quot;The Letter&quot; and international success (1967–1969) ===
As the Box Tops, they entered the studio under the guidance of producer Dan Penn to record Wayne Carson Thompson&#x27;s song &quot;The Letter&quot;. Though under two minutes in length, the record was an international hit by September 1967, reaching the Hot 100&#x27;s number-one position for four weeks, selling over four million copies, earning a gold disc, and receiving two Grammy Award nominations. During October 20–27, 1967, &quot;The Letter&quot; and The Hombres&#x27; &quot;Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out)&quot; were 1-2 on the WLS (AM) Silver Dollar Survey, marking a rare quinella involving two brothers of the same family (the Cunningham brothers), each in a different top 40 act.

After &quot;The Letter&quot; the band released &quot;Neon Rainbow&quot;, another tune written by Thompson and produced by Penn. An album called &quot;The Letter/Neon Rainbow&quot; appeared in November 1967. The Box Tops released three albums over a nine-month period from late 1967 to mid 1968. Some of the group&#x27;s instrumental tracks were performed by session musicians like Reggie Young, Tommy Cogbill, Gene Chrisman, and Bobby Womack at American Sound Studio. However, the actual group members performed on a number of their recordings, including &quot;The Letter&quot;, and on all live performances.

By January 1968, John Evans and Danny Smythe returned to school, thereby avoiding the draft. They were replaced by bassist Rick Allen (born January 28, 1946 in Little Rock, Arkansas) from the Gentrys and drummer Thomas Boggs (born July 16, 1944 in Wynne, Arkansas; he died May 5, 2008 in Memphis) from the Board of Directors.

&quot;Cry Like a Baby&quot; was a million-seller in 1968, peaking at #2 on the Hot 100. It has been covered by the Hacienda Brothers and Kim Carnes. &quot;I Met Her in Church&quot; and &quot;Choo-Choo Train&quot; were smaller hits released later that year. Near the end of 1968, the band switched producers, with Dan Penn being replaced by the team of Cogbill and Chips Moman. The duo was responsible for producing the band&#x27;s final 1968 hit, &quot;Sweet Cream Ladies, Forward March&quot; (which debuted on the Hot 100 on Chilton&#x27;s eighteenth birthday) and all of the band&#x27;s future releases through 1970.

=== Personnel changes and winding down (1969–1970) ===
In the summer of 1969, Thompson&#x27;s decidedly upbeat &quot;Soul Deep&quot; became the group&#x27;s final US Top 40 entry, peaking at #18 on the Hot 100 in late August. The follow-up single, &quot;Turn on a Dream&quot;, peaked at #58 on the Hot 100 and was a #29 hit in Canada.

Cunningham left the Box Tops to return to school in August 1969 and was replaced by Harold Cloud on bass (died July 10-2018 in Memphis). Eventually the group&#x27;s tolerance for the disrespect and fleecing they had endured as teen musicians from managers, lawyers, and promoters came to an end. According to a 2004 article in &quot;Puremusic.com&quot; written by Talley, a December 1969 British tour was canceled by the band after arriving in London to discover that instead of respecting the rider agreement, the local promoter insisted they play the tour with the opening reggae act&#x27;s toy drums, public address system amplifiers (instead of proper guitar amplifiers), and a keyboard with a broken speaker.

Finally, in February 1970, the remaining founding members, Talley and Chilton, were ready to move on and disbanded the group. However, the Bell record label kept releasing new Box Tops singles through early 1970, such as &quot;You Keep Tightening up on Me&quot; (#92 on the Hot 100 on March 21–28, 1970), using material that had already been recorded.

=== &quot;The Box Tops&quot; brand name continues (1972–74) ===
The Box Tops name (which was under the control of a management company) still had a certain amount of cachet and sales potential in the early 1970s. Lacking original band members, beginning in 1972 new studio groups (whose members remained anonymous) were assembled to record new Box Tops material in Memphis.

These later Box Tops records used some of the same production personnel which had produced and played on the group&#x27;s earlier recordings, but no original group members. Willie Mitchell&#x27;s Hi Records released two singles credited to the Box Tops, one in 1972 (&quot;Sugar Creek Woman&quot;) and one in 1973 (&quot;Hold On Girl&quot;). In 1974, Tommy Cogbill co-produced one final single credited to the group, &quot;Willobee and Dale&quot;, which appeared on the Stax label. None of these singles charted, or received much airplay, and they are generally not included in Box Tops retrospectives.

=== Chilton activity (1976) ===
In 1976, Pickwick Records recorded new versions of &quot;The Letter&quot; and &quot;Cry Like a Baby&quot; using lead vocalist Alex Chilton backed by studio musicians. These tracks were credited to The Box Tops, though Alex Chilton was the only group member involved. Both recordings were released in the UK on a various-artists LP set called &quot;The Heart Breakers and Tear Jerkers Collection&quot;.

=== Post-Box Tops careers ===
Each of the original members went on to work in the music industry in subsequent years after leaving the Box Tops. Chilton&#x27;s career path included work performing with Big Star, Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns, and his solo trio as well as briefly producing groups like The Cramps. Guitarist Talley went on to work in a variety of styles as a session guitarist and songwriter in Memphis, Atlanta, and Nashville. Artists and producers he has worked with have ranged from Billy Preston, Hank Ballard, Chips Moman, Billy Lee Riley, Billy Joe Royal, Webb Pierce, Waylon Jennings, Tracy Nelson, Willie Nelson, and Tammy Wynette to Sam and Dave&#x27;s Sam Moore, and others. He recorded two albums for Appaloosa Records with the group Fish Heads &amp; Rice, Certified in 1991, and 4 Heads in 1994. Bassist Cunningham won a spot in the White House orchestra in Washington, D.C., after completing his master&#x27;s degree in music. During his classical music career, he played with some of the world&#x27;s best performers; at Cunningham&#x27;s last public classical music performance, for instance, he performed at the White House with Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman. In the 1980s, he earned an MBA and changed careers. Evans played occasionally in Memphis groups after the Box Tops, while working as a luthier, eventually switching to a computer network administrator career. Smythe performed in Memphis soul and blues groups in the 1970s, later changing to a career in art by the 1980s, but returned to music performance in the 1990s.

=== One-off &amp; reunion (1989 &amp; 1996–2010) ===

There was a one-off Box Tops charity concert in Nashville at a venue called Ace of Clubs in 1989 for Harold Cloud&#x27;s family member. The lineup for this show comprised Chilton, Evans, Talley, Harold Cloud (bass), and Gene Houston (drums). At this show the group was also augmented by backup singers Tracy Nelson, Jonell Mosser, and Kim Morrison, and a full horn section.

America&#x27;s Freedom Festival, in conjunction with Wilsonwood Promotions, presented the Drifters and the Boxtops in concert at the Utah Lake State Park on Friday, June 29, 1990. The concert was sponsored by Food 4 Less, KZOL Oldies 96 FM, and Fred Meyer.

Cunningham next organized a reunion of all the band&#x27;s original members, including Chilton, in 1996. The group later released a self-produced album of new material recorded at Easley McCain Recording, &quot;Tear Off!&quot; and resumed performing concerts internationally. The &quot;Tear Off!&quot; album included a new original by guitarist Talley (&quot;Last Laugh&quot;); covers of Bobby Womack&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, Eddie Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Big Bird&quot; (often covered in solo concerts since the 1980s by Chilton), and The Gentrys&#x27; &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot;; and a new recording of &quot;The Letter&quot;. Other songs on the album reflected the band members&#x27; varied soul, novelty, rock-and-roll, and country music influences. B.B. Cunningham Jr. played a guitar on the album version of &quot;Trip to Bandstand&quot;, his 1959 Memphis novelty single. The album also featured horn arrangements and performances by The Memphis Horns, who subsequently participated in some of the group&#x27;s concerts. By 2000, John Evans was no longer in the band and was replaced by Nashville session man Barry Walsh. Evans is employed by the University of Memphis.

In 2001 the group contributed a Blondie cover tune to a various artists collection of &quot;songs you never thought you&#x27;d hear&quot; called &quot;When Pigs Fly&quot;.

Sold-out Box Tops concerts in Germany in 2003 were aired on German radio, and the group&#x27;s 2005 tour schedule showed a number of American dates planned despite the group members&#x27; busy careers outside the band. The Box Tops performed their last Memphis concert on May 29, 2009, at The Memphis Italian Festival.

On March 17, 2010, lead vocalist Alex Chilton died of a heart attack.

On July 28, 2010, the remaining Box Tops, Bill Cunningham, Gary Talley, and Ron Krasinski, plus Terry Manning (added for the show) played a tribute concert in honor of Alex Chilton at The City Winery in New York City.

=== Return of The Box Tops ===
In mid 2015, Bill Cunningham and Gary Talley reformed The Box Tops in response to continued requests by fans. On July 6, 2016, Danny Smythe died, aged 67.

September 23, 2017, marked the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Letter&quot; reaching #1. Cunningham, Talley, and Rick Levy joined the Happy Together Tour, performing to sold out shows across the U.S., together with Flo and Eddie of The Turtles, Chuck Negron of Three Dog Night, The Association, The Cowsills, and Ron Dante of The Archies.

In 2018, the Box Tops were inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. Harold Cloud died on July 10, 2018, in Memphis. John Evans died in December 2020 aged 72. Swain Schaefer died on February 16, 2019, aged 70.

<text>Mariano Azuela González (January 1, 1873 – March 1, 1952) was a Mexican writer and medical doctor, best known for his fictional stories of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. He wrote novels, works for theatre and literary criticism. He is the first of the &quot;novelists of the Revolution,&quot; and he influenced other Mexican novelists of social protest.

Among Azuela&#x27;s first published writing were some short pieces for the magazine &quot;Gil Blas Cómico&quot;, where he wrote under the pen name of &quot;Beleño&quot;, and his writing published under the heading &quot;Impresiones de un estudiante&quot; (&quot;Impressions of a Student&quot;) in 1896. His first novel, &quot;Maria Luisa&quot;, was written in 1907, followed by &quot;Los fracasados&quot; (&quot;The Failures&quot;) in 1908, and &quot;Mala yerba&quot; (&quot;Weeds&quot;) in 1909. The theme of his beginning novels are about fate. He wrote of the social life of Mexicans during the Díaz dictatorship. After experiencing the Mexican Revolution first-hand, his writing style became sarcastic and disillusioned. His first novel with the Revolution theme is &quot;Andrés Pérez, maderista&quot; in 1911, followed by &quot;Sin Amor&quot; (&quot;Without Love&quot;) in 1912, and his most popular, &quot;Los de abajo&quot; (&quot;The Underdogs&quot;) in 1915. He continued to write short works and novels influenced by the Revolution. It includes &quot;El camarada Pantoja&quot; (&quot;Comrade Pantoja&quot;) in 1937, &quot;Regina Landa&quot; in 1939, &quot;La nueva burguesía&quot; (&quot;The New Bourgeoisie&quot;) in 1941, and &quot;La maldición&quot; (&quot;The Curse&quot;, published posthumously) in 1955. These works mainly depicts the satirical picture of life in post revolutionary Mexico sharply and angrily stigmatizing demagoguery and political intrigue.

==Early life and career==

Azuela was born in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco to a small, but successful rancher, Evaristo Azuela and Paulina Azuela, on January 1, 1873. He grew up in a small farm owned by his father, which later influences the settings in many of his fictional works. He was first admitted to a Catholic seminary at the age of fourteen, but soon abandoned his religious studies. He studied medicine in Guadalajara, Jalisco. He received his M.D. in 1899, practicing medicine first in his home town of Lagos de Moreno, and later, after the Mexican revolution, practiced in Mexico City. In 1900, he married Carmen Rivera, niece of Agustín Rivera, priest and historian of Lagos de Moreno. He went on to have five sons and five daughters.

Like most young students, Azuela was opposed to the dictatorship of the Porfirio Díaz regime. During his days in the Mexican Revolution, Azuela wrote about the war and its impact on Mexico. After Porfirio Díaz was overthrown in 1911, Azuela served as state Director of Education of Jalisco under President Francisco I. Madero. Following Madero&#x27;s 1913 assassination, Azuela joined the Constitutionalist cause, which sought to restore the rule of law. He traveled with the military forces of Julián Medina, a follower of Pancho Villa, where he served as a field doctor. His participation in the conflict gave him ample material to write &quot;Los de abajo&quot; (&quot;The Underdogs&quot;) (1915). He later was forced for a time to emigrate to El Paso, Texas, when the counterrevolutionary forces of Victoriano Huerta were temporarily triumphant. It was there that he wrote &quot;Los de abajo&quot;, which was his first-hand description of combat during the Mexican revolution, based on his experiences in the field. It was first published as a serial in the newspaper &quot;El Paso del Norte&quot; from October 1915 to December 1915. The book did not receive general recognition until 1924, and it was hailed as a novel of the Revolution. &quot;Los de abajo&quot; (&quot;The Underdogs&quot;) depicts the futility of the Revolution, the opportunists in power, and the underprivileged majority of his country. He fought for a better Mexico, and he believed the Revolution corrected some injustices, but it has given rise to others equally deplorable.

==The Mexican Revolution’s Effect on Mariano Azuela’s Writing Career==
In his encyclopedia entry “Azuela, Mariano (1873-1952)”, Nicolás Kanellos underscores Azuela&#x27;s physical involvement in the war, and its influence on Azuela&#x27;s literary career. Kanellos begins by describing Azuela as, “one of Mexico’s greatest novelists and chroniclers of the Mexican Revolution” (Kanellos, 105). In describing Azuela as a “chronicler”, Kanellos immediately highlights one important feature of Azuela and his work, which is his tendency to record and portray history. In highlighting Azuela&#x27;s relationship between history and literature, Kanellos establishes the inseparability of political and global contexts within Azuela&#x27;s literary works; for example, Azuela&#x27;s novel “The Underdogs” recounts the events of The Mexican Revolution from the perspective of the rebel soldiers. Therefore, Kanellos emphasizes the existing relationship between history and its involvement in Azuela&#x27;s work. Kanellos then describes the reason as to why Azuela&#x27;s literary works are deeply infused with Mexican politics and history stating, “Azuela’s early career as a writer, in fact, was developed while participating in the Revolution first-hand as a physician in the army of Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa” (Kanellos, 105). The terms “first-hand” and “participating” underscore Azuela&#x27;s physical involvement in the war. Kanellos’ use of the word “developed” then underscores the manner in which Azuela&#x27;s physical involvement paved the way for his writing to grow and mature as a result of his experiences participating in the Mexican Revolution. Kanellos stresses in his encyclopedic entry the persisting role of history and its portrayal in Azuela&#x27;s work, but he also emphasizes the manner in history, in particular the Mexican Revolution, essentially birthed Azuela&#x27;s writing career.

==Cultural Identity in &quot;The Underdogs&quot;==

In Margy McCrary&#x27;s article, “The Aztec Connection: Exploring the Construction of Azuela&#x27;s Revolutionaries in The Underdogs”, she examines the description of Demetrio as a “full-blooded Aztec”. She argues he gains authority over the land, and constructs a cultural identity where he and Mexican peasants must establish in order to resist the Spanish conquerors. McCrary contends that the purpose of a revolution is to reject the identity of the colonizer, but in order to do this “some sort of unified identity is necessary for a group to revolt successfully” (McCrary 31). The pre-colonial Aztec is embodied by Demetrio Macías because he is connected to both his ancestors and the land. Demetrio is depicted as “riding proudly on his horse” with “pure-blooded Aztec cheeks”, however, Demetrio “seems devoid of any defined identity” because he never acknowledges a greater reasoning to his involvement in the revolution other than either revenge or satisfaction in being the revolutionaries&#x27; leader (Azuela 72). This illuminates that Azuela may care about the revolution more than the characters do. McCrary further explains that on page seventy-two of the novel, Macias and his “men threw out their chests as if to breathe the widening horizon” and the “immensity of the sky” illustrating how Demetrio&#x27;s freedom is connected to the earth itself and that Demetrio is a legitimate inhabitant of the land. Furthermore, the sense of freedom that Demetrio and the Mexican men feel on the land serves to “distance them from their oppressed identities as colonized beings” because they immediately forget their bleak lives as conquered peasants (36). By depicting Demetrio as a pure-blooded Aztec, Azuela reveals that he as an author is “displeased with the current, colonized identity of his people” and wishes to reconstruct a strong Mexican identity before it had “been influenced by the Spanish colonizers” (37). As a result, Azuela emphasizes the consequences of colonization because Demetrio is “so far separated from his own heritage and identity that he does not even recognize it consciously” (39). When Demetrio begins to forget his identity it results in “petty fighting, looting, and anarchy” (34). Azuela emphasizes Demetrio&#x27;s heritage so that readers understand what is at stake if cultural identity is lost.

==Later life==
In 1917 he moved to Mexico City where, for the rest of his life, he continued his writing, and worked as a doctor among the poor.

In 1942 he received the Mexican National Prize for Literature. On April 8, 1943 he became a founding member of Mexico&#x27;s National College, where he gave lectures on Mexican, French, and Spanish novelists, and on his own literary experiences. In 1949 he received the Mexican National Prize for Arts and Sciences. He died in Mexico City March 1, 1952 and was placed in a sepulchre of the Panteón Civil in the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres.

<doc id="548924" wikidata="Q506635" url="?curid=548924" title="Bretislav III">
<text>Henry Bretislav (latinized as &quot;Bretislaus&quot;, ; died 15 or 19 June 1197), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Bishop of Prague from 1182, then Duke of Bohemia as &quot;Bretislav III&quot; from 1193 to his death.

==Ecclesiastical career==
Henry was a son of Jindřich (d. after 1169) and his wife Margaret. After his studies at the University of Paris, he returned to Bohemia and was named provost at the Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Vyšehrad. In 1182, he accepted the diaconate from the hands of his Přemyslid cousin Archbishop Adalbert III of Salzburg. Henry Bretislav was elected on 25 March 1182 as successor of the late bishop of Prague Valentin, and went to Mainz to receive affirmation by Metropolitan Christian I. He was ordained a priest on 22 May and crowned bishop the following day.

Bretislav soon came into conflict with Duke Frederick of Bohemia, who had regained the Bohemian throne in 1178 and usurped discretionary power over ecclesiastical properties. In 1187, the bishop officially addressed Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to complain about the duke&#x27;s infringements. In turn, the emperor elevated Henry Bretislav to a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, providing that the Prague bishop was only subject to the Holy Roman Emperor. However, the imperial immediacy did not outlast Bretislav&#x27;s tenure.
In the ongoing quarrels over the Prague throne between Duke Frederick and his successors Conrad II and Wenceslaus II, he supported Ottokar, a younger son of the late King Vladislaus II with his second wife Judith of Thuringia. In 1192, Ottokar usurped the Bohemian throne from Wenceslaus II, allied with his younger brother Vladislaus Henry, Prince of Brno and Znojmo, whom he appointed Margrave of Moravia. Wenceslaus tried to petition Emperor Henry VI for assistance, but was captured. Henry Bretislav supported Ottokar, but was unable to pay the necessary tribute of 6,000 &quot;écus&quot; to the emperor for the Bohemian crown and the Moravian margraviate. While on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, he was captured by Henry VI, who held him captive at his court.

==Duke of Bohemia==
Emperor Henry VI, however, was not ignorant of Bohemian affairs. When Ottokar joined a revolt of several German princes against the ruling House of Hohenstaufen, he and his brother and Vladislaus Henry were declared deposed in June 1193 by a decision of the Imperial Diet at Worms. Ottokar was abandoned by the nobility and fled; the emperor exempted his cousin Bishop Henry Bretislav from the payment and enfeoffed him with the Bohemian duchy. Margrave Vladislaus Henry was summoned to Prague Castle, where he had to spend the following years suspiciously eyed by Duke Bretislav.

Bretislav had to secure his duchy by force of arms. By Christmas 1193, he was keeping court at Prague. In 1195, he drove Vladislaus out of Moravia and installed one of his supporters in the march. Bretislav also took part in an Imperial campaign in Meissen, where his army plundered the churches. To make amends, he planned to take part in the German Crusade of 1197, decided on at the diet of Worms of December 1195, but due to his prolonged illness it was never actualised. When Ottokar marched against Prague, Henry Bretislav proceeded to the Imperial Palace in Eger (Cheb), where he died on 15 or 19 June 1197. He is buried in the Doksany monastery church.

On 23 June the Bohemian nobles elected Margrave Vladislaus Henry his successor. Shortly afterwards, he came to terms with his brother Ottokar, who finally ascended the Prague throne and the next year obtained the royal title from Philip of Swabia, confirmed by the German king Frederick II in the 1212 Golden Bull of Sicily.

<text>The Alfa Romeo SZ (for Sprint Zagato) and codenamed ES-30 for Experimental Sportscar 3.0 litre, is a high-performance limited-production sports car built from 1989 to 1991 by a partnership between Centro Stile Zagato, Centro Stile Alfa Romeo and Centro Stile Fiat. It was unveiled as the ES-30 at the 1989 Geneva Motor Show as a prototype by Zagato with the styling house assigned the responsibility of assembling the car.

==Overview==
The SZ was an attempt to revive Alfa Romeo&#x27;s sporting heritage after its acquisition by Fiat in 1986, and was meant to recall the Giulietta Sprint Zagato from the late 1950s and early 1960s. A common misconception about the SZ is that the car was designed by Zagato, but was actually designed in-house. Robert Opron of the Centro Stile Fiat was responsible for the initial sketches while Antonio Castellana was largely responsible for the final styling details and interior. Only Zagato&#x27;s &#x27;Z&#x27; logo of was kept on the design, with Zagato&#x27;s signature double bubble roof being absent. An unusual design detail is its six headlights positioned in a trio on each side - a feature used also on later Alfa Romeo models in the 2000s. The unusual design of the car can be attributed to the use of early CAD/CAM, or computer-aided design and manufacturing by Alfa Romeo.

The car&#x27;s powertrain and chassis came from the Alfa Romeo 75, with assembly being carried out by Zagato at Terrazzano di Rho near the Alfa Romeo factory in Arese. The thermoplastic injection-moulded composite body panels were produced by Italian company Carplast and French company Stratime Cappelo Systems.

The suspension was from the Alfa Romeo 75 group A/IMSA car, modified by Giorgio Pianta, engineer and team manager of the Lancia and Fiat rally works team. The hydraulic damper system was by Koni. The SZ was originally equipped with Pirelli P Zero tyres (front 205/55 ZR 16, rear 225/50 ZR 16). The car came without any driver&#x27;s aids to provide a challenging experience to the drivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;home.wxs.nl/~evdbeek&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===RZ===
A convertible version of the SZ called the RZ (badged &quot;R.Z.&quot; for Roadster Zagato) was produced from 1992 until December 1994. Although almost identical in appearance, the two cars shared no body panels save for the front wings and boot. The RZ had a revised bumper and door sills to give better ground clearance and the bonnet no longer featured the aggressive ridges. Three standard colours were available; black, yellow and red, with black and yellow being more popular choices. Yellow and red cars got a black leather interior and black cars burgundy. Although the interior layout was almost unchanged from the SZ, the RZ had a painted central console that swept up between the seats to conceal the convertible roof storage area. 350 units were planned, but production was halted after 252 units when the Zagato factory producing the cars for Alfa Romeo went into receivership. A further 32 cars were completed under the control of the receivers before production finished at 284 units. Of those, three RZs were painted silver with burgundy interior and the final RZ was painted pearlescent white.

==Characteristics==
* Powerplant: naturally aspirated V6. SOHC, 2 valves per cylinder, Bosch Motronic ML 4.1 fuel injection. Rated at at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. Engine code: AR 61501
* SZ : Only one official colour scheme was available: red with grey roof, tan leather interior
* One SZ with a black exterior colour was made for Andrea Zagato
* RZ : Only three official colour schemes were available: red with black leather, yellow with black leather, and black with red leather
* At the end of production, three RZs were made in silver, and one in pearlescent white
* 1,036 SZs were produced, exceeding planned production of 1,000 units. About 100 were exported to Japan.
* 278 RZs were produced of a planned production of 350 units.

=== SZ Trofeo ===
The SZ Trofeo is a modified version of the SZ built for a single-model race series run on circuits throughout Europe, but primarily in Italy at venues such as Imola, Misano, and Mugello. Only 13 cars were built, with most finished in red, and at least one was black. Wheels are 16 inch OZ three-piece items fitted with Pirelli tires, of which each team received three sets. The interior is largely stripped, but retains the dash and door panels, consistent with era regulations. The engine is largely identical to those used in road-going versions of the SZ and RZ, but with balanced internals and different tuning.

<text>Rodger Trueman Cuzner (born November 4, 1955) is a Canadian politician and diplomat who currently serves as a Senator for Nova Scotia in the Senate of Canada. He previously served as the Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Cape Breton—Canso and its predecessor, Bras d&#x27;Or—Cape Breton, from 2000 to 2019. For most of 2003, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister under Jean Chrétien, and served as Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, Workforce Development and Labour in the Justin Trudeau government. Between 2020 and 2023, Cuzner served as the Consul General of Canada to the United States (Boston).

==Early life and education==
Cuzner was born the second of six children born to Trueman and Kay Cuzner in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. He studied physical education at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish. He worked as the Special Event Coordinator for the Cape Breton Department of Recreation, Culture and Facilities, where he was responsible for major events like the Millennium Countdown 2000. Cuzner has been very involved with hockey throughout his life. He coached Team Nova Scotia at the Canada Games in 1995 and 1999.

==Political career==
Cuzner was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Bras d&#x27;Or—Cape Breton and, later, Cape Breton—Canso. He was first elected in 2000. Cuzner served as Parliamentary Secretary to former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien from January 13, 2003, to December 11, 2003, and held other key positions within the Liberal Caucus, including chair of Nova Scotia Caucus, chair of Atlantic Caucus, and Chief Opposition Whip. He also served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, Workforce Development and Labour.

In his early years in parliament, Cuzner focused on matters surrounding both Veteran Affairs and Fisheries and Oceans. During the later part of his Parliamentary career, much of his attention was directed toward Workforce Development and National Labour issues.

As an elected official representing Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island, he worked with community and industry to build and mature the tourism sector. Major investments in infrastructure contributed to this growth, notably two of the top-rated golf courses in the world, Cabot Links and Cabot Cliffs.

Cuzner regularly represented the Liberal Party on the weekly MP panel on CTV News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Power Play&quot;, and was regularly asked to appear on other national political affairs programs, on television, and radio.

Cuzner traditionally delivered a humorous, politically themed rewrite of &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; on the last house sitting before the holiday break. After his retirement, Darren Fisher delivered it.

He was twice voted as &quot;Most Collegial&quot; Member of Parliament by his Parliamentary colleagues, and was described by Maclean&#x27;s in 2017 as &quot;Parliament&#x27;s Sense of Humour&quot;.

Cuzner was re-elected to a sixth straight term with 74.4% of the vote in the 2015 Canadian federal election.

On April 26, 2019, Cuzner announced he wouldn&#x27;t run for re-election in the 2019 election.

==Post-political life==
On October 31, 2020, it was reported that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Cuzner as the new Consul General to the United States (Boston).

On October 31, 2023, he was summoned to the Senate of Canada by Governor General Mary Simon, on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

==Personal life==
Cuzner and his wife Lynn (née Hopkins) have three children: Mitch, Scott and Brad.

<text>The National Women&#x27;s Football Association (NWFA) was a full-contact American football league for women headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The league was founded by Catherine Masters in 2000, as the two benchmark teams, the Alabama Renegades and the Nashville Dream played each other six times in exhibition games. The opening season was in 2001 featuring ten teams. The NWFA did not officially field any teams for the 2009 season.

The NWFA was originally called the National Women&#x27;s Football League, but changed its name after the 2002 season. The name change came after pressure from the National Football League. The NFL also required the league to change the logos of some teams whose logos resembled those of NFL teams.

League founder Catherine Masters was inducted into the American Football Association&#x27;s Semi Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Professional American Football League (WPFL) was a women&#x27;s professional American football league in the United States. With teams across the United States, the WPFL had its first game in 1999 with just two original teams: the Lake Michigan Minx and the Minnesota Vixens. Fifteen teams nationwide competed for the championship in 2006.

Unlike the other women&#x27;s American football franchises, the WPFL operated as a fall league and not a spring league.

==History==
In 1999 two businessmen, Carter Turner and Terry Sullivan, decided to research the feasibility of a professional women’s football league by gathering together top female athletes into two teams and playing an exhibition game in front of an audience. The game between the Lake Michigan Minx and the Minnesota Vixens at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota was a success and turned into a six-game exhibition tour across the country dubbed the “No Limits” Barnstorming Tour.

The success of the Barnstorming Tour led to the first official WPFL season in 2000 with 11 teams competing nationwide. This first season ended with some turmoil however; the regular season was shortened by several games, players were not given their promised $100 per-game salaries, and there were allegations regarding instability with some of the league&#x27;s financial backers.

The WPFL rebounded the next year completing the 2001 season after several organizational changes. Notable changes included the departure of founders Sullivan and Turner (Turner then founded the WAFL; restructure of the league by several WPFL team owners: Melissa Korpacz - New England Storm, Robin Howington - Houston Energy, and Donna Roebuck and Dee Kennamer - Austin Rage; changes to player/team compensation; and the moving of the start of the season from fall to summer.

<text>Leonard Shaun Goater (born 25 February 1970) is a Bermudian former professional footballer, coach and pundit whose currently part of the coaching staff at Aston Villa W.F.C.

As a player he was a striker for a number of English clubs in the 1990s and 2000s. Goater&#x27;s first professional club was Manchester United, but he did not reach the first team, making his League debut in 1989 after moving to Rotherham United. He played for Rotherham for seven years before moving to Bristol City in 1996. Two years later he moved to Manchester City for a fee of £400,000.

He is most well known for his time at Manchester City, where he scored over 100 goals between 1998 and 2003, finishing as the club&#x27;s top scorer for four consecutive seasons. After leaving City, Goater had spells with Reading, Coventry City and Southend United, before retiring in May 2006. He represented Bermuda 36 times, scoring 32 goals.

==Early life==
Goater was born in the Bermudian capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his grandmother and two aunts. His introduction to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his education in the United States, where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, who invited him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his mother, who was a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing so. At this time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Goater&#x27;s trial resulted in the offer of a professional contract, but he did not break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: &quot;It took me a good two years to get used to life in England. At first I thought the sun never shone and it wasn&#x27;t for me.&quot; However, he gradually got used to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner&#x27;s medal for the 1996 Football League Trophy the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.

In the 1995–96 close season, Goater received offers from Spanish club Osasuna and newly formed South Koreans Suwon Samsung Bluewings, but having recently married, he decided to stay in England. Shortly after, he moved to Bristol City for a fee of £175,000. Goater&#x27;s Bristol City debut came against Gillingham. Goater scored, but Bristol City lost 3–2. City finished the season in fifth, qualifying for the playoffs, but lost to Brentford. The following season Bristol City were pushing for promotion into the First Division, and Goater scored regularly, eventually being named in the PFA Team of the Year for the division. In a little under two years with Bristol City, he scored 45 goals in 81 appearances. On 26 March 1998, transfer deadline day, Goater signed for Manchester City, who paid Bristol City £400,000 for his services.

===Manchester City===
Goater joined Manchester City at a turbulent point in their history, with newly appointed manager Joe Royle battling to save the club from relegation to the Second Division. Goater scored three goals in the seven remaining matches of the 1997–98 season, but this was not enough to prevent the club from being relegated to the third tier of English Football for the first time ever. Fans were initially sceptical as to Goater&#x27;s ability, but as goals were scored supporters were gradually won over, creating a song in his honour, &quot;Feed The Goat And He Will Score&quot; (to the tune Cwm Rhondda). The 1998–99 season saw Goater score 21 goals, finishing the season as Manchester City&#x27;s top goalscorer. The last of these was the winning goal in a play-off semi-final against Wigan Athletic, sending Manchester City to Wembley Stadium for a playoff final which saw City promoted after a penalty shootout.

The 1999–2000 season was even more successful for Goater. He was the club&#x27;s top goal scorer again, this time with 29 goals, and was named Manchester City&#x27;s Player of the Year by the supporters after Manchester City were promoted for the second successive year. In the summer, Goater was awarded the freedom of Bermuda, with 21 June declared as &quot;Shaun Goater Day&quot; on the island. The following season, Goater made his first appearance in top flight football at the age of 30, though injury and the presence of new signings Paulo Wanchope and former World Player of the Year George Weah meant he had to wait three months to do so. Again established in the first team, Goater was Manchester City&#x27;s top goalscorer for the third consecutive season, but his 11 goals could not save the team from relegation.

During the 2000–01 season, upheaval took place at Manchester City, with manager Royle departing to be replaced by Kevin Keegan. Goater was the club&#x27;s top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions but not save the club from relegation back to the First Division. In the 2001–02 season, Goater became the first Manchester City player since Francis Lee in 1972 to score more than 30 goals in a season. City were promoted as champions, and he was the club&#x27;s top scorer for the fourth time in a row, as well as being the top scorer in the division.

Over the summer of 2001–02, there was speculation that Goater would be transferred, as Manchester City had twice broken their transfer record by buying strikers Jon Macken and Nicolas Anelka. Goater stayed, but opportunities were limited. He started just 14 games, but scored seven goals, including his 100th for the club, which came in a derby match against local rivals Manchester United. In February 2003, Goater struck against the same opposition to score the fastest goal by a substitute in Premier League history, just 9 seconds after coming onto the pitch. He also scored a goal that would have won City the match, but it was disallowed.

Shortly before the end of the 2002–03 season, Goater announced his intention to leave Manchester City when the season finished in order to seek regular first team football. In his final match for Manchester City, he was asked to captain the side in Manchester City&#x27;s final game at Maine Road. In total, Goater scored 103 goals in 212 appearances for Manchester City. Since ending his footballing career, Goater has been critical of both Kevin Keegan, who he claims never praised him, and Nicolas Anelka, who he feels wanted to be &#x27;the daddy&#x27; of Manchester City.

===Later career===
Goater moved to Reading on 1 August 2003. Reading chairman John Madejski described the transfer as &quot;the biggest in Reading Football Club&#x27;s history&quot;, but Goater&#x27;s time there was not a happy one. Shortly after Goater&#x27;s arrival, Reading manager Alan Pardew left for West Ham United, and Pardew&#x27;s replacement, Steve Coppell, did not regard Goater as part of his plans. In his second and final season at Reading, Goater played just four times, and was loaned to Coventry City. Goater then considered retirement, but instead moved to League One club Southend United for a final season as a professional. The move, a free transfer, was completed on 3 August 2005. At Southend, Goater acted as a mentor for young striker Freddy Eastwood, and contributed towards a second successive promotion for &quot;the Shrimpers&quot;, scoring 11 goals. His final appearance before retirement was on 6 May 2006, when Southend played Bristol City, one of Goater&#x27;s former clubs. The crowd included an estimated 400 Manchester City fans who travelled to Southend to mark the occasion.

Goater and three other partners in the Bermuda-based East End Group Limited announced an amalgamation with Telecommunications Networks Limited (now renamed East End Telecom) on 9 November 2007, which added to the group&#x27;s two other business subsidiaries, East End Asphalt and East End Aviation. Goater serves as the group&#x27;s Business Development Manager.

When in England, Goater has made regular appearances in local media covering the Manchester area. These have included a column entitled &quot;Read the Goat&quot; in the official Manchester City match programme, and a regular guest spot on the BBC Radio Manchester programme &quot;Blue Tuesday&quot;.

==International career==
Goater has also played for the Bermudian national team 22 times, scoring 20 goals though due to Bermuda&#x27;s lowly standing in world football he never played in a major international tournament. He made his first international appearance at the age of 17 against Canada. Other sources list him with 36 appearances, scoring 32 goals.

During the 1992–93 season, Goater missed eight weeks of the club season in order to represent his country in qualifying for the 1994 World Cup. However, Bermuda finished bottom of a group containing El Salvador, Canada and Jamaica. His final appearance was in June 2004 against El Salvador.

When playing for Bermuda, Goater was often the only professional player in the team. Bermudian journalist Chris Gibbons described the difference between Goater and his teammates: &quot;He&#x27;s a class above every other player on the island. Before he went to England he was just quick, but now he&#x27;s a totally different player, a lot more aggressive and a much better header of the ball. The problem has been that he sets up chances for the others without them being on the same wavelength.&quot; However, Goater noted that this had a detrimental aspect: &quot;My fitness dropped off while I was with Bermuda. It was like being on holiday. The team just ate what they liked. I kept to my professional diet for about two or three weeks until peer pressure took over.&quot;

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Goater returned to Bermuda, receiving an official welcome from the Premier of Bermuda Alex Scott on his arrival. A week later, Southend played the Bermuda national team in an appreciation game for their former striker. Goater has expressed a wish to enter coaching following his retirement, and studied for the UEFA B coaching licence in 2005. Since 2003, Goater has organised the annual &quot;Shaun Goater Grass-roots Soccer Festival&quot;, a football coaching event for children in Bermuda. On 14 September 2006, Goater and the United Soccer Leagues announced that Bermuda would receive a professional football team that would play in the third division of American football, the USL Second Division. Goater had roles as both a director and player of the team, the Bermuda Hogges.

Goater left Bermuda Hogges in 2008, to concentrate on youth coaching with North Village Rams in his home town. He was appointed as the head coach in 2008. He served as the head coach of the &quot;Rams&quot; from 2008 to 2013, in the process winning seven trophies, including the league, three Friendship titles, Charity Cup and two Dudley Eve titles.

On 8 August 2015, it was announced that Goater would join Northern Premier League Division One North club New Mills as assistant manager to Andy Fearn. In September 2015, Fearn and Goater resigned from New Mills after nine defeats in nine games.

On 17 February 2017, Goater was appointed manager of Northern Premier League Division One North club Ilkeston.

On 5 February 2019, Macclesfield Town announced that they had hired Goater to the staff of their under-18s team.

On 8 October 2021, Goater returned to Manchester City as part of the academy coaching staff. He joined his former club&#x27;s Academy coaching staff as part of the Premier League&#x27;s Coach Inclusion &amp; Diversity Scheme (CIDS), a programme set up with the aim of increasing the number of Black, Asian and mixed heritage coaches working full-time in professional football. Goater was set to work across all the club&#x27;s Academy age groups, from the foundation phase up to the professional development phase, in different roles to ensure the provision of a wide range of experience.

In April 2023, Goater joined Manchester City W.F.C. as assistant to manager Gareth Taylor.

On 28 August 2024, Goater departed Manchester City to take the role of Assistant Head Coach at Aston Villa W.F.C. On 11 December 2024, Goater was named caretaker manager after Aston Villa Women parted company with manager Robert de Pauw. Goater took charge of his first game later that same day, a 4–1 victory over Charlton Athletic in the Women&#x27;s League Cup.

On 22 January 2025, Aston Villa hired Natalia Arroyo as new manager, and Goater returned to his role in the coaching staff. During his time as caretaker manager, Goater took charge of 4 matches, featuring 3 wins and 1 draw and had expressed a desire to take on the job permanently. 

==Personal life==

Goater is married to Anita, his childhood sweetheart, and has two daughters, Amaya and Anais (born 3 October 2000 in Wythenshawe, Manchester). He was awarded the MBE in 2003 for services to sport and young people in Bermuda. His autobiography, &quot;Feed the Goat: The Shaun Goater Story&quot; was published in September 2006.

<text>Lucius Mussius Aemilianus &quot;signo&quot; Aegippius (died 261 or 262) was a Roman who held a number of military and civilian positions during the middle of the third century. He is best known as a Roman usurper during the reign of Gallienus.

== Sources ==
The sources for this emperor include Eusebius, &quot;Ecclesiae Historia&quot; 7.11; &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot;, 32.4; &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, &quot;Gallienus&quot; 4.1–2, 5.6, 9.1; &quot;Tyranni Triginta&quot; 22.1–8, as well as several papyri and one inscription.

== Career ==

Mussius Aemilianus probably was of Italian stock. His career in imperial service is documented up to 18 May 247 from an inscription recovered at Fiumicino. Appointments he held up to that date include &quot;praefectus vehiculorum trium provinciarum Galliarum&quot;, &quot;procurator Alexandreae Pelusi&quot; and a third location (now lost), &quot;procurator portus utriusque Ostiae&quot;.

Valerian appointed him &quot;Praefectus&quot; of Roman Egypt, a position he held from possibly as early as 256 to 261. While the primary concern of the governor of Egypt was to safeguard the harvest and delivery of grain to the populace of Rome, he had other responsibilities which included resuming the persecution of Christians that had started under his predecessor Aurelius Appius Sabinus. Eusebius preserves a letter of Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria where the bishop documents his trial before Mussius Aemilianus for professing Christianity, for which he was exiled to Cephro in the Libyan Desert. A surviving papyrus, dated to 259/260, has been identified as an independent witness to this trial.

== Usurpation ==

He supported the rebellion of the Macriani against Gallienus (260–261). When the Macriani were defeated Mussius Aemilianus proclaimed himself emperor.

Gallienus sent his general Aurelius Theodotus to Egypt to deal with Aemilianus. After a short struggle Aemilianus was defeated (before 30 March 262), captured, and later strangled in prison. Subsequently Memor, a possible supporter, was executed.

<text>Lloyd Crow Stark (November 23, 1886September 17, 1972) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 39th Governor of the U.S. state of Missouri. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Biography==
Stark was born in Louisiana, Missouri, the son of Clarence McDowell and Lillie Crow Stark. Stark was a 1908 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. After serving four years as a naval officer, Stark went into the family business, the Stark Brothers&#x27; Nursery, as vice-president and general manager. He was a major in the US Army during World War I. During his volunteer stint, Stark served in the United States and France, including the 1918 Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

Stark&#x27;s political career began in 1928, when he chaired Missouri&#x27;s State Highway Bond Campaign. He served one term as the governor of Missouri from 1937 to 1941 and was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from Missouri in 1940. During his gubernatorial term, Stark&#x27;s administration established the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, abolished interstate trade barriers, passed a police reorganization bill, and established a merit system for selection of state employees.

Lloyd Stark had a fierce political rivalry with Harry S. Truman against whom he ran for the Senate in 1940 and lost when he and the prosecutor Maurice M. Milligan, who had toppled the Kansas City political machine, split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Democratic primary.

Although the loss to Truman heralded the end of his political career, Stark spent the remainder of his working life managing the Stark Brothers Nurseries. Meanwhile, Stark influenced the political careers of Clarence Cannon and Stuart Symington. Stark died in Clayton, Missouri in 1972.

The falling out between Stark and the Kansas City boss Tom Pendergast following the 1936 election is widely believed to have been the turning point in Pendergast&#x27;s fall from power. Pendergast had held so much sway in Missouri in the 1930s that the governor&#x27;s mansion was dubbed &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot;

Stark sought and received Pendergast&#x27;s support. Pendergast&#x27;s minions were more corrupt and obvious than usual during the 1936 election. That prompted numerous investigations, and Stark turned overtly against Pendergast, who was eventually convicted of income tax evasion.

Stark served as Governor for six weeks beyond his normal term as a result of the controversial 1940 Missouri gubernatorial election, also called the &quot;Great Governorship Steal&quot;, in which Pendergast-aligned Democrats attempted to overturn a narrow victory by Republican Forrest C. Donnell. Stark opposed these efforts and vetoed resolutions from the Missouri General Assembly that attempted to recount the election in a manner favorable to Democrats. The controversy was ultimately resolved by the Missouri Supreme Court in favor of Donnell, who was inaugurated six weeks late on February 26, 1941.

==Family life==
Lloyd Stark was part of a family rather prominent in Missouri and was active with his brother Paul in the then family-owned business Stark Brothers&#x27; Nursery (the oldest nursery in America and at one time the largest in the world). The nursery had popularized the Golden Delicious apple.

Stark married Margaret Pearson Stickney of Baltimore in 1908. Together they had sons Lloyd Stickney and John Wingate Stark. Margaret died in 1930. Stark then married Katherine Lemoine Perkins in 1931. They had two daughters, Mary Murray Spottswood and Katherine Lemoine Stark.

Stark&#x27;s cousin, Charles Stark Draper, was a prominent inventor. The uncle of Lloyd Stark and Charles Stark Draper, state representative, James O. Stark was a prominent supporter and adviser of presidential contender and Speaker of the House, Champ Clark (despite this connection, Clark&#x27;s son Bennett, Missouri&#x27;s other Senator, crucially supported Truman in 1940) - and the husband of the niece of Republican anti-slavery activist Elihu Washburne.

Stark&#x27;s home at Louisiana from 1915 to 1940 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 as the Gov. Lloyd Crow Stark House and Carriage House.

<doc id="548963" wikidata="Q66002" url="?curid=548963" title="Adam von Trott zu Solz">
<text>Friedrich Adam von Trott zu Solz (9 August 1909 – 26 August 1944) was a German lawyer and diplomat who was involved in the conservative resistance to Nazism. A declared opponent of the Nazi regime from the beginning, he actively participated in the Kreisau Circle of Helmuth James Graf von Moltke and Peter Yorck von Wartenburg. Together with Claus von Stauffenberg and Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, he conspired in the 20 July plot and was supposed to have been appointed Secretary of State in the Foreign Office and lead negotiator with the Western Allies if the plot had succeeded. 

==Life==
===Early life and career===

Trott was born in Potsdam, Brandenburg, into the Protestant Trott zu Solz dynasty, members of the Hessian &quot;Uradel&quot; nobility. He was the fifth child of the Prussian Culture Minister August von Trott zu Solz (1855–1938) and his wife Emilie Eleonore von Schweinitz (1875–1948), whose father served as German ambassador in Vienna and Saint Petersburg. By her mother, Anna Jay, Emilie Eleonore was a great-great granddaughter of John Jay, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the first Chief Justice of the United States.

Trott was first raised in Berlin and from 1915 was sent to the &quot;Französisches Gymnasium&quot; preschool. When his father resigned from office in 1917, the family moved to Kassel, where Trott attended the &quot;Friedrichsgymnasium&quot;. From 1922, he lived in Hann. Münden and temporarily joined the German Youth Movement. He obtained his Abitur school leaving certificate in 1927 and went on to study law at the Universities of Munich and Göttingen.

Trott developed a strong interest in international politics during a stay in Geneva, seat of the League of Nations, for several weeks in Autumn 1928. He spent Hilary term of 1929 in Oxford, studying theology at Mansfield College, Oxford, when he became a friend of the historian A. L. Rowse. Trott returned to Oxford in 1931 on a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Balliol College, where he gained a number of close friends including David Astor and Diana Hopkinson (née Hubback), whose memoirs and letters would later become key documents of Trott&#x27;s life in Nazi Germany, and with whom he possibly engaged in a love affair. He also made the acquaintance of the eminent philosopher R. G. Collingwood. Rowse, a homosexual, developed an intense infatuation with the heterosexual Trott and called him one of the most beautiful, intelligent and charming men he had ever met. In his 1961 book &quot;All Souls and Appeasement&quot;, which was published when active homosexuality was still a crime in Britain, Rowse wrote about Trott&#x27;s &quot;beautiful head&quot; with an &quot;immensely lofty forehead, deep-violet eyes, nobility and sadness in the expression even when young, infinitely sensitive and understanding&quot;. He wrote, &quot;I had never met anything like it&quot;. Rowse called his relationship with Trott an &quot;ideal platonic&quot; relationship and said that Trott was a man he could never forget. Rowse, who was active in the Labour Party, claimed to have introduced Trott to socialism and noted that Trott had translated parts of Rowse&#x27;s book &quot;Politics and the Younger Generation&quot; into German when they were published in &quot;Neue Blätter für den Sozialismus&quot;. Following his studies at Oxford, Trott spent six months in the United States.

Deeply influenced by the theories of Hegel, Trott believed that the most pressing issue raised by the Great Depression would be how to seek a synthesis of conservatism and socialism, which he believed to be the only solution to the Great Depression. For Trott, the Great Depression proved the failure of capitalism as an economic system, but at the same time, he was unwilling to accept communism as an alternative, which led him to seek a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and communism, arguing in a 1933 letter to his father that the &quot;right to work&quot; had replaced Hegel&#x27;s &quot;right to a free will&quot; as the most pressing issue of the modern age. In the same letter, Trott argued that what was needed was an economic system that guaranteed every man a job, and that he considered the individual freedom to count for nothing if one was unemployed. Somewhat to the shock of his conservative father, in the early 1930s Trott was willing to exchange ideas with Social Democrats as he set about developing a sort of socialist conservatism. Trott told his father in February 1933 that &quot;the positive rights of the individual&quot; could be secured if the rights of the &quot;masses&quot; were &quot;held sacred&quot;, which he believed the new government of Adolf Hitler and Franz von Papen had no intention of doing.

===Travels===
In 1937, Trott was posted to China as a research fellow for the Institute of Pacific Relations under a research grant from the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;. He took advantage of his travels to try to raise support outside Germany for the internal resistance against the Nazis. At the time there was an informal alliance between China and Germany, with a German military mission training the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, which was largely armed with German weapons, and German businesses being favored with investments in China in exchange for China helping German rearmament by selling the &quot;Reich&quot; certain strategic raw materials at below cost. Given the closeness in relations between China and Germany, as a German citizen, Trott enjoyed a certain privileged status in China, as Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had often described Nazi Germany as a model for China.

A Sinophile, Trott had gone to China to study Confucian philosophy and learn Mandarin, as he put it that he was hoping to find in &quot;China&#x27;s ancient wisdom&quot; a solution to the spiritual malaise of the West. Trott believed that modern Western civilization had lost any sense of the spiritual, which he believed still existed in China. The British historian D. C. Watt rather dismissively wrote that Trott was an impractical idealist who spent much of 1937 and 1938 in China looking for the answers to the problems of modern life by studying Confucianism and Taoism. The Confucian ideal of rule by enlightened and philosophical mandarins also appealed to Trott as an inspiration for a political system. The Confucian principle that mandarins should not serve an unjust emperor and that it was better to suffer and die rather than serve a tyrant influenced Trott&#x27;s political thinking. Together with his Chinese teacher who served as his translator, Trott traveled several times to Beijing to talk to various Confucian scholars living in that city, hoping to find the spirituality that he believed the West was lacking and needed so desperately. During the Sino-Japanese War, which began in July 1937, Trott&#x27;s sympathies were entirely with China. During his time in China, Trott got to know the head of the German military mission, General Alexander von Falkenhausen, very well, and as both men were disillusioned by the pro-Japanese line taken by the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; after the very pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Joachim von Ribbentrop became Foreign Minister in February 1938, they bonded over their shared disapproval of Ribbentrop and his anti-Chinese foreign policy line. In June 1938, the German military mission in China was ordered to return to the &quot;Reich&quot; and Germany ceased its arm sales to China as Ribbentrop swung German foreign policy decisively behind Japan, causing a rapid chill to set in over the once warm relations between Nanking and Berlin. Trott decided to leave China at the same time that the German military mission was recalled.

One of Trott&#x27;s closest friends was the British journalist Shiela Grant Duff who, however, passionately disagreed with him over the issue of Czechoslovakia, a country that she admired and loved as much he hated it. The nationalist Trott made no secret of his dislike of Czechoslovakia as an &quot;artificial state&quot; created by the Treaty of Versailles and believed that Germany had the right to annex the Sudetenland region, meaning that essentially Trott supported Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy in regards to Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Chinese historian Liang Hsi-Huey wrote there was a certain dichotomy in Trott&#x27;s thinking between his dislike of the Nazis and his support for Germany&#x27;s great power ambitions, which made for an ambivalent attitude towards Nazi foreign policy. Liang, whose father Liang Lone was the Chinese minister in Prague between 1933 and 1939, wrote that people like Trott, conservative nationalists opposed to Hitler who sympathised with China in its struggle against Japan, had much difficulty accepting the thesis that nations like Czechoslovakia had the right to exist. Liang wrote that there was a striking contrast between Trott&#x27;s views towards China, which he argued had the right to determine its own future and should not be dominated by Japan, versus his views towards Czechoslovakia, which he saw as an &quot;artificial state&quot; that was occupying land that rightfully belonged to Germany. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew most of the men involved in the plots against Hitler between 1938 and 1944 personally, wrote that these men were all nationalists whose views towards Czechoslovakia and Poland were essentially the same as Hitler&#x27;s – namely that Eastern Europe was Germany&#x27;s rightful sphere of influence and the &quot;Reich&quot; had the right to take whatever it wanted in the region. After the Munich Agreement Trott, in a letter to his friend Lord Lothian, praised &quot;Mr. Chamberlain&#x27;s courageous lead&quot; in ensuring that the Sudetenland was allowed to join Germany without a war and disparaged Winston Churchill as a &quot;warmonger&quot;.

In 1939, during the course of three visits to London, Trott lobbied Lord Lothian and Lord Halifax to pressure the British government to abandon the &quot;containment&quot; policy directed against Hitler, which had been adopted on 31 March 1939 with the &quot;Polish guarantee&quot;. Trott was a close friend of Ernst von Weizsäcker, the State Secretary at the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;, and he visited London as an unofficial diplomat representing Weizsäcker who, in a move reflecting the chaotic politics of Nazi Germany, had adopted his foreign policy that ran parallel to the policy of the Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Weizsäcker, knowing that a planned German invasion of Poland scheduled for August 1939 (later pushed back to 1 September) was likely to cause an Anglo-German war, had adopted his policy of offering to restore independence to Czechoslovakia, without the Sudetenland, in exchange for which Britain would end the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland and allow Germany to reincorporate the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Corridor, and parts of Upper Silesia lost to Poland after the First World War. Weizsäcker was a man of extreme anti-Polish prejudices who warmly welcomed the idea of a war to destroy Poland, but he was rather less keen on the idea of a war with Britain, hence his repeated efforts to sever Britain from Poland in 1939. Like Weizsäcker, Trott was unwilling to consider returning the Sudetenland, but he was prepared to consider restoring Czech independence in exchange for Germany taking back all of the lands lost to Poland. The plan drawn up by Weizsäcker and Trott called for Britain to end the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland to pressure the Poles to return the disputed territories. Though Trott professed to believe the Poles would give in to German diplomatic pressure once the &quot;guarantee&quot; had been removed, such a situation would allow Germany to invade Poland without fear of a war with Britain, although Trott also claimed to believe that if such a situation were to emerge, then the Wehrmacht generals would overthrow Hitler. Rowse characterised Trott&#x27;s visits to Britain in June 1939 as a &quot;double mission, an official and an unofficial one&quot;: to sound out the British Establishment about where Britain stood in regards to the Danzig Crisis and to report this back to Hitler, and to also seek to make contacts with Britain on behalf of the resistance group. Trott spent the weekend of 2–3 June 1939 at Cliveden and on 7 June 1939 met Chamberlain at Chequers.

Lord Lothian told Trott that Britain was unwilling to undo the Munich Agreement and accepted the Sudetenland as part of the &quot;Reich&quot;, but it could not accept the &quot;Reich&quot; Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia, as it was essential that Czech independence be restored; Anglo-German relations could not be improved unless that happened. As a Rhodes scholar, Trott was able to use his friends from Oxford in the Establishment to meet Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in June 1939. At his meeting with Chamberlain at Chequers, Trott was informed that it was not possible for Britain to end the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland and that if Germany wanted better relations, &quot;it was for Herr Hitler to undo the mischief he had done&quot;. Chamberlain complained that British public opinion had been &quot;passionately stirred&quot; by the German occupation of the rump state of Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and that Britain would go to war with Germany rather than see another nation &quot;destroyed&quot;.

Trott submitted an account of his British visits to Walther Hewel, who in turn submitted it to Hitler. When Trott returned to Germany, Weizsäcker tried to set up a meeting for Trott to brief Hitler and Ribbentrop about his British visit, but neither wanted to see him. Trott returned to Britain for a third visit to repeat his &quot;Danzig for Prague&quot; offer, and this time he stated he was not coming on behalf of the German government, but rather as a representative of a resistance group, which confused British officials as to his true loyalties. The German historian Klemens von Klemperer argued that the purpose behind Trott&#x27;s &quot;Danzig for Prague&quot; offer was to discredit Hitler, since he expected Hitler to refuse it if the British made it, which would somehow cause the Wehrmacht generals to turn against Hitler. Klemperer wrote that there was a certain lack of &quot;clear strategy&quot; behind the &quot;Danzig for Prague&quot; proposal, since Trott himself never entirely made it clear how this plan to ensure that the Free City of Danzig rejoining Germany without a war was supposed to cause the overthrow of Hitler.

Wheeler-Bennett, who had lived in Berlin between 1927 and 1934 and who met Trott during his visits to London in 1939, wrote that he &quot;...had about him a certain confused political mysticism, a vague Hegelianism which induced in him, not, to be sure, the worship of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;, but a deep veneration for German military and political traditions, and what he believed to be the innate integrity of the German soul&quot;. Wheeler-Bennett further wrote that Trott and his friend Helmuth von Moltke, who came with him to London, were both intense German nationalists who &quot;...though they deplored the spirit of the Munich Agreement and the subsequent dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, expressed strong anti-Czech sentiments, and from neither was there forthcoming any indication that a &#x27;de-nazified&#x27; Germany was prepared to forgo Hitler&#x27;s annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland. Indeed it was hinted from that Britain and France might well reward the conspirators, if successful, with the return of Germany&#x27;s former colonial possessions&quot;. Rowse, who saw Trott for the last time during his visits to Britain in 1939, wrote that Trott&#x27;s Hegelianism &quot;profoundly affected his mind&quot; as &quot;with him black was never black, and white white; black was always in the process of becoming white, white of becoming black&quot;. Rowse wrote &quot;...Adam entered deeply, ambivalently into relations with the Nazis without being one, indeed while belonging to the resistance movement&quot;.

The German historian Hans Mommsen wrote that the majority of the conservatives opposed to Hitler in no way wanted a return to the democratic Weimar Republic, which they also rejected, but instead looked back to the reformers who restructured Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars as their ideal and role model. For the anti-Nazi conservatives, the emphasis was upon reforming the system instead of a revolution to destroy it, as the majority of the conservatives believed in the ideal of the &quot;volksgemeinschaft&quot; that would unite the German people as one and only wanted a &quot;true&quot; &quot;volksgemeinschaft&quot; instead of what they saw as the twisted Nazi version of it. The emphasis was on putting into effect the &quot;right&quot; ideas of National Socialism, which the conservatives believed the Nazis had botched in the execution. In regards to foreign policy, the anti-Nazi conservatives believed that Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy goal of making Germany into Europe&#x27;s number one power was correct. Their objections to Nazi foreign policy were only that Hitler was executing his foreign policy in a reckless, adventurist way that threatened to create a coalition that would defeat Germany; they were only opposed to the means, not the ends, of Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy. Mommsen argued what he called the &quot;ambivalence&quot; of Trott, who worked towards achieving certain Nazi foreign policy goals but at the same time worked for the overthrow of the Nazi regime, which makes sense if one accepts the thesis that Trott and others like him were out to reform the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; from what they saw as its Nazi perversion, instead of working for its destruction.

The distinction that Trott drew between Germany&#x27;s &quot;rightful&quot; policy of seeking to undo the Treaty of Versailles and his opposition to the Nazi regime was often lost on his British friends since, for many of them, he was advocating the same foreign policy goals as Hitler. Trott did not understand the way in which British public opinion had changed as he spent much time in Britain attacking the Treaty of Versailles in such violent language that many of his British friends came to believe that he was no different from the Nazis. Rowse attended a meeting at the Cliveden estate, where von Trott spoke with Lord Lothian, Lord Astor, Lord Halifax and Sir Thomas Inskip about Anglo-German relations, repeated his &quot;Danzig for Prague&quot; offer and praised &quot;the greatness of our &quot;Führer&quot;&quot;. However, Rowse said that when he was alone with Trott the latter said: &quot;If they kill me, you will never forgive them, will you?&quot;

Trott&#x27;s ideas led to a complete rejection of democracy as a system morally no different from National Socialism. In 1938, Trott wrote to a British friend that what was happening in Germany was a &quot;European phenomenon&quot; and believed that with the Industrial Revolution, European society had become dehumanised and lost its spiritual core. Trott wrote that this was as much a problem in democratic as totalitarian countries: &quot;It is my opinion that this pandering to the instinctual side of human consciousness, as much by democracy as by totalitarianism, is what has led to the sterile and cynical defeatism that lies at the root of Europe&#x27;s intellectual chaos&quot;. Trott believed the &quot;mass society&quot; created by the Industrial Revolution had allowed demagogues to exploit &quot;the masses&quot; and argued that the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; system of individual liberty built around democracy was essentially no different from National Socialism as it allowed &quot;the masses&quot; to be exploited. In a letter to Grant Duff, Trott wrote: &quot;You have not satisfactorily answered my argument, that it is possible that capitalist and imperialist democracy may use liberty simply as a cloak for a policy that relies very much on compulsion, whereas some aspects of &#x27;authoritarian systems could provide a basically more genuine guarantee of human rights in modern industrial society&quot;. In 1939, Trott wrote that the last ten years had shown the &quot;indiscriminate trust in the judgement of the masses is no use... One way or the other, popular movements have led to despotism&quot;.

In Trott&#x27;s view, only the rule by Germany&#x27;s traditional elites who were committed to conservative values and would rule according to the rule of law could ensure a truly just society. Trott believed that only in such a system, in which traditional elites ruled by excluding the masses from politics, could a political system be created that was genuinely concerned with the best interests of society. He told his friend Julie Braun-Vogelstein &quot;Go and write an essay on Tradition and Socialism!&quot; He meant that only the rules by traditional elites could really achieve socialism.

Trott called for a political system that would secure the &quot;liberation of the masses from economic need&quot; by the authoritarian rule by the traditional elites, whose values would be based on Christianity.

Various messengers from the &quot;Widerstand&quot; movements had arrived in Britain in 1938 to 1939 stating if only Britain abandoned appeasement, the leaders of the Wehrmacht would stage a &quot;putsch&quot; to depose Hitler, rather than fight a war with Britain again. In August 1939, the British government repeatedly warned Germany that an attack on Poland would cause a war with Britain. One reason was the hope that the Wehrmacht would indeed overthrow Hitler, rather than risk another world war.

On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and on 3 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany. Despite the promises of numerous messengers, the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to Germany, continued on with the conquest of Poland and made no effort to depose Hitler. The fact that the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to Hitler in 1939 in spite of all the promises from anti-Nazi Germans that it would not, if only Britain made a firm stand against Hitler, greatly discredited the &quot;Widerstand&quot; movement in British eyes, and much of Trott&#x27;s difficulty in enlisting British support from that fact.

A friend of Weizsäcker, Trott formally joined the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; in 1939 at his suggestion after having worked for the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; as a researcher on China for the previous two years. In October 1939, Trott went to the United States to attend a conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations, in Virginia Beach, in November 1939. On his way to the United States, Trott was almost interned in Gibraltar as an enemy alien when his ship had stopped there, but he was able to persuade the British officials that he was an Afrikaner from South Africa by using his Balliol tie as proof that he attended Balliol College, which was true, and thus meant that he could not be a German, which was not. He also visited Washington, D.C. in October of that year in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain American support. He met with Roger Nash Baldwin, Edward C. Carter, William J. Donovan and Felix Morley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. During the conference in Virginia Beach, Trott met numerous members of the business and academic worlds of the United States and Canada who were interested in China.

Wheeler-Bennett, who owned an estate in Virginia and shared Trott&#x27;s interests in Sinology, also attended the conference in Virginia Beach and wrote: &quot;In the plenary sessions and committees of the conference, von Trott observed a very &#x27;correct&#x27; attitude. He did not openly defend Nazi principles, but confined himself to several recapitulations of the German case on the usual well-known lines, which might be employed by Germans of nearly any political complexion. In private conversation, however, he used a very different tone, frankly declaring himself an anti-Nazi, yet maintaining that Germany must keep much of what she had taken in Poland. He stressed the readiness of the Army for a &#x27;quick peace&#x27; on the basis of the &quot;status quo&quot; less Congress Poland, indicated the preparations already on foot for the restoration of the &quot;Rechsstaat&quot; in Germany, and urged the Western Allies to reiterate and redefine their peace terms on the lines of Mr. Chamberlain&#x27;s speeches of September 4 and October 12, 1939. To the suggestion that a non-Nazi Germany might, as an earnest of good faith, restore some of the territorial acquisitions of Adolf Hitler, von Trott returned an uncompromising negative&quot;. 

Trott&#x27;s proposals were passed on to the US Department of State, the Canadian Ministry of External Affairs and the British Embassy in Washington DC, where the reaction was deeply negative, as the consensus was that Germany would have to give up its gains in Poland and the Czech lands as the price for peace, which Trott had indicated that he no interest in doing. However, Trott&#x27;s suggestions for the basis of peace, which he wrote down after meeting several German emigres in the United States, were passed on the White House and led President Roosevelt to send Summer Welles, the undersecretary at the State Department, on a peace mission to Europe in February 1940 to try to mediate an end to the war.

===Foreign Office===
Friends warned Trott not to return to Germany, but his conviction that he had to do something to stop the madness of Hitler and his henchmen led him to return. Once there, in 1940 Trott joined the Nazi Party to access party information and monitor its planning. At the same time, he served as a foreign policy advisor to a clandestine group of intellectuals planning the overthrow of the Nazi regime, known as the Kreisau Circle.

In late spring 1941, Wilhelm Keppler, Secretary of State (&quot;Staatssekretär&quot;) at the German Foreign Office, was appointed director of Special Bureau for India (Sonderreferat Indien) created in the Information Ministry to aid and liaise with the Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, a former president of the Indian National Congress, who had arrived in Berlin in early April 1941. The day-to-day work with Bose became the responsibility of Trott, who used the cover of the Special Bureau for his anti-Nazi activities by travelling to Scandinavia, Switzerland and Turkey and all of Nazi-occupied Europe to seek out German military officers opposing Nazism. Bose and Trott, however, did not become close, and Bose most likely did not know about Trott&#x27;s anti-Nazi work.

According to the historian Leonard A. Gordon, there were also tensions between Trott and Bose&#x27;s wife, Emilie Schenkl, each disliking the other intensely.

Trott was a member of the Kreisau Circle, a group of intellectuals who believed in a sort of conservative Christian socialism, who met at the estate of Count von Moltke in Kreisau in Silesia. The Kreisau Circle was in contact with the main opposition group led by General Ludwig Beck and Carl Frederich Goerdeler but differed with the Beck–Goerdeler group over a number of issues. On 22 January 1943, at the house of Count Peter Hans Yorck von Wartenburg, a meeting was held between the two groups. Attending the meeting for the &quot;senior group&quot; were General Beck, Goerdeler, Ulrich von Hassell and Johannes Popitz and for the Kreisau Circle Moltke, Trott, Yorck von Wartenburg, Eugen Gerstenmaier and Fritz von der Schulenburg. The left-learning Kreisau Circle members objected to Goerdeler&#x27;s beliefs in laissez-faire capitalism and to his plans to restore the monarchy. The clash between the two groups was in large part generational as the conservative &quot;senior group&quot; were all older men like Goerdeler who had come of age under the German Empire and were far more attached to the House of Hohenzollern than were the younger men like Trott, who had come of age under the Weimar Republic. The diplomat Hassell of the &quot;seniors&quot; and the policeman Schulenburg of the &quot;juniors&quot; mediated a compromise, despite the shouting between Goerdeler and Moltke, but the differences were by no means resolved. After the meeting of 22 January, no conferences were held, but Trott and Schulenburg remained in regular contact with Hassell and Popitiz.

In 1942, Trott, together with other members of the Kreisau Circle, became vaguely aware of the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot; and became curious of the fate of the Jews sent away to &quot;resettlement in the East&quot;. In March 1943, Trott reported at a meeting of the Kreisau Circle that he learned through sources within the &quot;Reich&quot; government that he considered very reliable that there was a concentration camp in Upper Silesia that held about 40,000–50,000 people with a &quot;killing rate&quot; of 3,000–4,000 people per month. Trott did not name the camp in Upper Silesia, but it seems that he was referring to Auschwitz concentration camp.

Like most other German conservatives, Trott had deep doubts about the intelligence and morality of ordinary people and held that only an elite had the necessary qualities to govern. In 1943, Trott wrote: &quot;An exclusively rationalist upbringing has made us fail to understand both human nature and the realities of mass society, and we have come to ignore the demons which the &quot;Vermassung&quot; of mankind has released&quot;. Trott believed in the original positive view of the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; of Germany as a Central European power, which was neither of the West nor of the East. He expressed these ideas in his memorandum &quot;Germany Between East and West&quot;, which is lost, but according to those who read it called for Germany to seek a &quot;middle way&quot; between the &quot;eastern principle of political realism&quot; and the &quot;western principle of individuality&quot;, which in practice would mean a social-economic system that would be a mixture of both capitalism and communism. He believed that &quot;eastern&quot; countries like the Soviet Union were too collectivist, &quot;western&quot; countries like the United States were too individualistic, and Germans like himself needed to develop a middle way between east and west for the betterment of all of humanity. Trott believed that both capitalist democracy and communism were flawed systems that had dehumanised society and that Germany should follow neither.

Despite Trott&#x27;s reputation as someone oriented towards &quot;Western&quot; values, based on his education at Oxford and his Anglo-American friends, he was in fact deeply hostile towards the American &quot;pioneer&quot; ideal of a rugged individualist on both moral and practical grounds and believed that such individualism promoted selfishness, greed and amorality.

Trott came to find his political idea in the &quot;mir&quot; (&quot;commune&quot;) of Imperial Russia. Germans tended to have two contradictory pictures of Russia as viewing it as a primitive and savage &quot;Asian&quot; country that was threatening Europe or seeing it in idealised and romantic terms as a place in which the people were simple but more spiritual than the people in the West. Trott had a rather idealised and romanticised view of the &quot;mir&quot;, as he believed the Russian &quot;muzhiks&quot; had a lifestyle where everybody worked together as a community but still allowed room for individualism, non-conformity and eccentricities, the perfect blend of the extremes between East and West that Trott sought for Germany. Trott believed the life of the &quot;muzhiks&quot; in the &quot;mir&quot; was deeply influenced by the values of Orthodox Church, making for a very spiritual life while at the same time accepting individualism and rationality. Moreover, Trott believed life in the &quot;mir&quot; was simple and in harmony with nature; was untouched by either modern technology or ideology; and allowed people to be honest, spiritual and personal in a way that was not possible in either the Soviet Union or the West. He believed that the Soviet regime had in its campaign to &quot;collectivise&quot; Soviet farms had destroyed his idealised &quot;mir&quot;, but his romantic view of the &quot;mir&quot; provided the basis for Trott&#x27;s thinking about the sort of society that he wanted to bring about. Trott&#x27;s beliefs about the need for more &quot;spiritual&quot; society brought him into conflict with Carl Goerdeler and Colonel Hans Oster, who wanted to restore the monarchy and bring back the system that had existed up until 1918 in Germany, which Trott rejected by arguing that something new was needed.

Trott belonged to the &quot;Easterner&quot; faction of the opposition, which favoured making peace with the Soviet Union first after the overthrow of Hitler and distrusted the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; powers of the United States and Great Britain. In December 1943, Trott told Hassell that he felt the United States and the United Kingdom were too fearful of &quot;a change of regime [in Germany] should turn out to be only a cloak hiding a continuation of militaristic Nazi methods under another label&quot;. Certain underground Social Democratic politicians complained of an increase of the appeal of the underground Communist Party and of the Soviet-sponsored Free German National Committee among the German working class. As a result, the underground SPD politicians asked their &quot;parlour-pink&quot; friend Trott to appeal to the United States and Britain to change their policies towards Germany. In April 1944, during a visit to Switzerland, Trott met with British and American diplomats to complain that to most anti-Nazi Germans, it seemed that &quot;the Anglo-Saxon countries are filled with bourgeois prejudice and pharisaic theorizing&quot;, in contrast to the Soviets, who were offering &quot;constructive ideas and plans for the rebuilding of Germany&quot;. Trott stated that after three years of war with the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht now had considerable respect for the fighting power of the Red Army, and he claimed that the propaganda of the Free Germany Committee in Moscow, which made a distinction between the German people and the Nazi regime, was having much impact in Germany.

Wheeler-Bennett wrote that Trott was &quot;no Red sympathizer&quot; and what he was &quot;endeavouring to do, in fact, was to induce London and Washington to engage in a bidding match with Moscow from the result of which Germany could not but benefit, but he certainly did not favor a Bolshevik solution&quot;. Wheeler-Bennett wrote the thinking of the Kreisau Circle was very &quot;confused&quot;, but they &quot;were not Communists&quot;. Wheeler-Bennett concluded: &quot;Their thinking, it is true, turned to the East rather than the West because, in their idealistic impractical illusions, they looked for an upheaval both in Russia and in Germany. If this were to occur, the two states would have many problems in common, problems which could not be solved by the established bourgeois standards of the West, but which called for a radically new treatment which should be neither authoritarian nor democratic, but which should be guided by a return to &#x27;the spiritual (but not the ecclesiastical) traditions of Christianity&#x27;&quot;.

===20 July 1944 plot===
Trott was one of the leaders of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg&#x27;s plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Hitler. He was arrested within days, placed on trial and found guilty. Sentenced to death on 15 August 1944 by the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; (People&#x27;s Court), he was hanged in Berlin&#x27;s Plötzensee Prison on 26 August.

==Commemoration==
Trott is one of five Germans who are commemorated on the World War II memorial stone at Balliol College, Oxford. His name is also recorded among the Rhodes Scholars war dead in the Rotunda of Rhodes House, Oxford.

In July 1998, the British magazine &quot;Prospect&quot; published
an edited version of the lecture given by the German historian Joachim Fest at the inauguration of the Adam von Trott Meeting Room at Balliol College, Oxford. Fest said:

The Adam von Trott Memorial Appeal at Mansfield College runs annual lectures on themes relevant to his life and work, and funds scholarships for young Germans to read for a master&#x27;s degree in politics at the college.

==Clarita von Trott==
Trott married Clarita Tiefenbacher in June 1940. He was survived by her (she had been jailed for some months) and by their two daughters, who were taken from their grandmother&#x27;s house by the Gestapo after his execution and given to Nazi Party families for adoption. Their mother recovered them in 1945. Clarita died in Berlin at the age of 95 on 28 March 2013.
==Quotations==
* &quot;I am also a Christian, as are those who are with me. We have prayed before the crucifix and have agreed that since we are Christians, we cannot violate the allegiance we owe God. We must therefore break our word given to him who has broken so many agreements and still is doing it. If only you knew what I know Goldmann! There is no other way! Since we are Germans and Christians we must act, and if not soon, then it will be too late. Think it over till tonight.&quot; (Trott was speaking in an attempt to recruit Lieutenant Gereon Goldmann, a German Army medic and former Roman Catholic seminarian. Goldmann had balked at violating the soldier&#x27;s oath and had questioned the morality of assassinating Hitler. However, Goldmann overcame his qualms and joined the 20 July Plot as a carrier of dispatches.)

<text>Alfonso Carrasquel Colón, better known as Chico Carrasquel (January 23, 1926 – May 26, 2005), was a Venezuelan professional baseball player, coach, scout and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop from 1950 to 1959, most prominently as a member of the Chicago White Sox where he became the first Latin American in MLB history to start in an All-Star Game in . A four-time All-Star known for his exceptional defensive skills, Carrasquel was the first in a long line of Major League shortstops from Venezuela including, Luis Aparicio, Dave Concepción, Ozzie Guillén and Omar Vizquel among others. He also played for the Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Athletics and the Baltimore Orioles.

After his playing career, Carrasquel worked as a manager in the Venezuelan Winter League and also worked as a major league scout. He later worked as a color commentator on the White Sox&#x27; Spanish language game broadcasts and, as the team&#x27;s Community Relations Representative. In , he was selected in the inaugural class of the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Playing career==
Born in Caracas, Carrasquel began his professional baseball career in at the age of 17 with the Cervecería Caracas team, where he hit the first home run in Venezuelan Professional Baseball League history. He was signed in by the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was immediately promoted to the Double-A Fort Worth Cats. Carrasquel provided good fielding and hit .315 during the season and .364 in the playoffs to help spur the Cats to the 1949 Texas League championship. His inability to speak English fluently may have caused Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey to sell him to the Chicago White Sox although, Rickey later admitted that the move was a mistake. White Sox&#x27; General Manager Frank Lane solved the language communication problem by trading Carrasquel&#x27;s uncle Alex for reliever Witto Aloma, who served as the interpreter between Carrasquel and White Sox&#x27; manager Jack Onslow.

Carrasquel joined the White Sox in 1950, becoming the third Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball after his uncle, Alex Carrasquel (Washington Senators, 1939) and Chucho Ramos (Cincinnati Reds, in 1944). He became the White Sox&#x27;s starting shortstop, replacing the 41-year-old Luke Appling, who had held the position since 1930. Carrasquel soon established himself as an excellent defensive player, combining with second baseman Nellie Fox to make one of the best double play combinations in the league. His cheerful disposition and apparent love for playing baseball, made him extremely popular with Chicago fans. As a rookie, Carrasquel hit for a career-high .282 batting average in 141 games and, amassed a 24-game hitting streak until Red Sox pitcher Ellis Kinder stopped the streak. In September, he suffered a torn cartilage in his right knee and had to sit out the remainder of the season. Carrasquel finished the season ranked third in voting for the American League Rookie of the Year Award, behind Walt Dropo and Whitey Ford, and finished 12th in the American League Most Valuable Player Award ballot.

In , Carrasquel beat out the reigning American League Most Valuable Player, Phil Rizzuto, in voting for the shortstop of the American League in the 1951 All-Star Game. He became the first Latin American player to be selected to start in an All-Star Game. On July 19, 1951, Carrasquel broke Rizzuto&#x27;s Major League record by handling 297 consecutive chances in 53 games without committing an error. The record would stand for 18 years until , when Don Kessinger of the Chicago Cubs set a new record by playing in 54 games without committing an error. He ended the year leading the league&#x27;s shortstops in assists and in fielding percentage. In November 1951, it was reported that Boston Red Sox manager, Lou Boudreau, wanted to trade Ted Williams for Carrasquel but Lane refused the offer.

Carrasquel had an off year in 1952 as a broken finger and then weight problems saw his batting average drop to .248 in 100 games. After the 1952 season, trade rumors reportedly had the Cleveland Indians offering the American League&#x27;s runs batted in champion, Al Rosen, in exchange for Carrasquel but, the trade never transpired. In 1953, Carrasquel was once again voted as the starting shortstop for the American League in the 1953 All-Star Game and ended the season first among the league&#x27;s shortstops in fielding percentage.

During spring training in 1954, it was reported that White Sox manager Paul Richards was not pleased with Carrasquel&#x27;s lack of effort on the field. It was a charge that would continue to pursue Carrasquel for the remainder of his tenure with the White Sox. Carrasquel responded with his most productive season in , when he was voted to make his third start as the American League shortstop in the 1954 All-Star Game and, posted career-highs in home runs (12), RBI (62), hits (158), runs (106), extra-base hits (43), walks (85). Batting as the White Sox leadoff hitter, he led the league in games played and in plate appearances while hitting for a .255 batting average. Defensively, he led the league&#x27;s shortstops in double plays and in fielding percentage.

In July 1955, new White Sox manager, Marty Marion, replaced Carrasquel in favor of shortstop Jim Brideweser, citing Carrasquel&#x27;s lackadaisical efforts and indifferent attitude towards playing. There was some speculation among major league managers that, playing in the Venezuelan Winter League during the off-season might be wearing him down. Between spring training, the regular major league season, and then a season of winter baseball in Venezuela, Carrasquel was playing in more than 200 games a year. Despite this setback, Carrasquel was still selected to his fourth All-Star game, this time as a reserve behind Harvey Kuenn. He still showed flashes of his former self as in a game against the Baltimore Orioles on August 23 when, he scored from first base on a bunt. Nellie Fox hit a bunt down the third base line and, when Orioles third baseman, Gus Triandos, left his base to field the ball, Carrasquel rounded second base and continued to third, where he was called safe on a close play. When the Orioles argued with the umpire without calling a time out, Carrasquel dashed to home plate without drawing a throw. Although his dedication was being called into question by Marion and the sporting press, Carrasquel still finished among the league leaders in assists, putouts and in fielding percentage.

Carrasquel had been instrumental in helping the White Sox sign another young, Venezuelan shortstop named Luis Aparicio, who went on to become a perennial All-Star player and was eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame. By , Aparicio was deemed ready to play in the major leagues and, with Marion dissatisfied with Carrasquel&#x27;s level of play, he was traded along with Jim Busby to the Cleveland Indians for Larry Doby in October of that year.

After two and a half seasons with the Indians, Carrasquel was traded to the Kansas City Athletics for Billy Hunter in June 1958. He played half a season for the Athletics before they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles for Dick Williams in October 1958. On May 10, 1959, Carrasquel was hit above his left eye by a thrown baseball as he was running the base paths and had to be carried off the field. During a physical examination in September, it was discovered that Carrasquel only had fifty percent of his vision in his left eye, perhaps stemming from the May incident. He ended the year with a career-low .223 batting average and in December the Orioles released him. He became a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Chicago White Sox in January 1960 but was released at the beginning of the season. Carrasquel then signed with the Montreal Royals of the International League in April but was released after hitting for a .206 average in 35 games.

==Career statistics==
In a ten-year major league career, Carrasquel played in 1,325 games, accumulating 1,199 hits in 4,644 at bats for a .258 career batting average along with 55 home runs, 474 runs batted in and a .333 on-base percentage. He was a disciplined hitter, posting a solid 1.052 walk-to-strikeout ratio (491-to-467). A four-time All-Star, Carrasquel led the American League three times in fielding percentage, once in assists and finished his career with a .969 fielding percentage.

==Managing career and later life==
Carrasquel returned to his native Venezuela where continued to play in the Venezuelan Winter League until when, he retired as an active player at the age of 41. He later became the manager of the Leones del Caracas, leading them to the 1982 Caribbean Series championship title. Carrasquel also spent time as a scout for the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets. He later worked as a color commentator on the White Sox&#x27; Spanish language broadcasts from to and, as the team&#x27;s Community Relations Representative until . In , Carrasquel helped start a nonprofit foundation to help underprivileged children in Venezuela and the United States. The Chico Carrasquel Foundation transports barrio youngsters to YMCA centers, museums, baseball games, and historical places throughout Venezuela.

==Honors==
In , the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League honored Carrasquel by renaming the Puerto la Cruz baseball stadium as the Estadio Alfonso Chico Carrasquel. The VPBL also honors annually the best manager in the league with the Chico Carrasquel Award.

In , Carrasquel was selected in the inaugural class of the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

On the occasion of Ozzie Guillén&#x27;s first home game as White Sox manager in the season, Carrasquel joined Guillén and fellow Venezuelans Luis Aparicio and Dave Concepción in throwing out the first ball at the home opener. Carrasquel called it his proudest moment.

==Legacy==
As the first Venezuelan to become a star player in Major League Baseball, Carrasquel became a national idol and was an influential figure in his native country. His accomplishments as a player influenced the aspirations of future Latin players including Aparicio and, helped pave the way for their baseball careers.

Carrasquel&#x27;s influence in Venezuela may have extended into the geopolitical arena as well. At a time during the Cold War when communists threatened to destabilize the country, Walter Donnelly, the United States Ambassador to Venezuela, arranged for Carrasquel&#x27;s family to come to Yankee Stadium for an event honoring him in July . Donnelly told &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine that &quot;he honestly believed the event was a setback for communist propagandists in Venezuela. Under no circumstances could a similar trip have been made to Russia or any of the satellite countries.&quot;

Carrasquel&#x27;s uncle, Alex Carrasquel, and his nephew Cris Colón, also played in Major League Baseball. Carrasquel died of cardiac/respiratory arrest in Caracas, Venezuela on May 26, at the age of 77.

<doc id="548972" wikidata="Q731492" url="?curid=548972" title="Elihu B. Washburne">
<text>Elihu Benjamin Washburne (September 23, 1816 – October 22, 1887) was an American politician and diplomat. A member of the Washburn family, which played a prominent role in the early formation of the United States Republican Party, he served as a congressman from Illinois before, during and after the American Civil War. He was a political ally of President Abraham Lincoln and General (later President) Ulysses S. Grant. During Grant&#x27;s administration, Washburne was the 25th United States Secretary of State briefly in 1869, and was the United States Minister to France from 1869 to 1877.

In his youth, when his family became destitute, Washburne left home in Maine at the age of 14, to support himself and further his education. After working for newspapers in Maine and studying law, Washburne passed the bar and moved to Galena, Illinois, where he became a partner in a successful law firm. Washburne was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852 and served from 1853 to 1869, which included the American Civil War and the first part of Reconstruction. While advocating Lincoln&#x27;s war policy, Washburne sponsored an up-and-coming Grant; they were acquainted because Grant had moved to Galena shortly before the war to work in his father&#x27;s leather goods business. Washburne advocated for Grant&#x27;s promotions in the Union Army, and protected him from critics in Washington and in the field. Washburne was Grant&#x27;s advocate in Congress throughout the war, and their friendship and association lasted through Grant&#x27;s two terms as president.

As a leader of the Radical Republicans, Washburne opposed the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson and supported African American suffrage and civil rights. Washburne was appointed United States Secretary of State in 1869 by President Grant, out of respect for his championship of Grant&#x27;s career during the Civil War, and to give Washburne diplomatic clout after being appointed minister to France. Washburne&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of State lasted for only eleven days, but he served in France for eight years, where he became known for diplomatic integrity and his humanitarian support of Americans, other neutrals, and Germans in France during the Franco-Prussian War. For his efforts, he received formal praise from governments in both France and Germany. Washburne&#x27;s friendship with Grant ended after the contentious 1880 Republican convention, when Washburne was a candidate for president. He did not garner wide support, but Grant had been the front runner for an unprecedented third term, and was disappointed when the party eventually turned to dark horse James A. Garfield. In retirement, Washburne published a biography of anti-slavery politician Edward Coles, and a memoir of his own diplomatic career in France.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Washburne was born on September 23, 1816, in Livermore, when Maine was part of Massachusetts. He was the third oldest of eleven children born to Israel and Martha (née Benjamin) Washburn. Washburne was the grandson of Captain Israel and Abiah (King) Washburne. His grandfather served as an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution and was a descendant of John Washburne, who served as Secretary of the Plymouth Colony while in England. John Washburne was a Puritan colonist who emigrated to America in 1631 and settled in Duxbury, Massachusetts.

Washburne&#x27;s father settled in Maine in 1806 and set up a shipbuilding trade at Whites Landing on the Kennebec River in 1808. Following Puritan heritage, Israel was a strict disciplinarian and Washburne and his siblings were instructed in the Bible and put to work daily in the fields and on other chores, with no time for leisure. During the winter months Washburne attended district schools that used &quot;birch rod&quot; corporal punishment. Washburne&#x27;s family fell on financial hard times in 1829, and his father, who was then in the mercantile business, was forced to sell his general store. The family was destitute and forced to rely on farming for subsistence, while Washburne and several of his brothers had to fend for themselves. At the age of 14, Washburne added the letter &quot;e&quot; to his name, as was the original ancestral spelling, and left home in search of education and a career.

After attending public schools, Washburne worked as a printer on the &quot;Christian Intelligencer&quot; in Gardiner, Maine, from 1833 to 1834. From 1834 to 1835 Washburne taught school and from 1835 to 1836 he worked for the &quot;Kennebec Journal&quot; in Augusta, Maine. Washburne attended Maine Wesleyan Seminary, studied law with Judge John Otis, and completed his legal studies with a year at Harvard Law School from 1839 to 1840. In 1840 he passed the bar exam, and moved west to Galena, Illinois. In Galena, Washburne entered into law partnership with Charles S. Hempstead.

==Marriage and family==
On July 31, 1845, Washburne married Adele Gratiot, the niece of his law partner and the daughter of Colonel Henry Gratiot and Susan Hempstead Gratiot, members of one of Galena&#x27;s most prominent families. Washburne had met Adele shortly after arriving in Galena; she was 10 years younger than Washburne, and known to be attractive, well-educated, and charming. The Washburnes had seven children including sons Gratiot, Hempstead, William P., and Elihu B. Jr., and daughters Susan and Marie L. The Washburnes were married for 42 years, which ended with Washburne&#x27;s death.

Washburne became active in politics as a Whig, and served as a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1844 and again in 1852. In 1848 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress.

In 1852, Washburne was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected eight times, and represented northwestern Illinois from 1853 to 1869. While in Congress, Washburne was chairman of the Committee on Commerce (34th Congress, and 36th through 40th Congresses), and the Committee on Appropriations (40th Congress).

In 1854 Washburne supported Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s unsuccessful candidacy for the United States Senate. In the mid-1850s the Whig Party dissolved, and the Republican Party was founded as the major anti-slavery party. Washburne joined the Republican Party, and in 1856 supported its first candidate for president, John C. Frémont.

Washburne backed Lincoln&#x27;s unsuccessful candidacy for the United States Senate in 1858. In 1860, Washburne enthusiastically supported Lincoln&#x27;s successful presidential campaign.

===American Civil War===
During Lincoln&#x27;s presidency Washburne supported the Union. As a trusted friend, he advised Lincoln informally, and kept him abreast of political news from Illinois.

As Lincoln made his way to Washington, D.C., in early 1861 to begin his presidential term, his supporters feared an assassination attempt. Washburne consulted Winfield Scott, the commander of the Army, who increased security in Washington and the surrounding area. Lincoln arrived in Washington incognito on February 23, 1861, and Washburne was on hand to meet him.

===Sponsored Ulysses S. Grant===

Washburne was one of only a few men in Washington, D.C., who had previously known Ulysses S. Grant, a fellow resident of Galena. Grant was a graduate of West Point and had served in the Army for eleven years, including the Mexican–American War. Initially, Grant and Washburne seemed like an odd political pairing; Grant was a Douglas Democrat and Washburne an ardent abolitionist and founder of the Republican Party. Despite those differences, Washburne became an early and ardent Grant supporter, and helped secure his promotions to the general officer ranks.

Though Grant had no rank or commission at the start of the war, he took the initiative to recruit a company of volunteers in Galena, and accompanied them to Springfield, the state capital. Grant discussed with Washburne his hope that his West Point education and previous military experience would lead to a field command; Washburne promised to discuss the matter with Governor Richard Yates. Yates quickly offered Grant a militia commission to serve as mustering officer and continue training the volunteer units which were being raised to rapidly expand the Army. Grant accepted, but continued his efforts to obtain a field command.

With Washburne&#x27;s sponsorship, Grant was commissioned a colonel of volunteers on June 14, 1861, and appointed to command the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. During his command of the regiment and through the Vicksburg Campaign, Washburne kept in close touch with Grant through his brother, Major General Cadwallader C. Washburn.

Washburne continued as Grant&#x27;s advocate and defender in Washington. In September 1861, Washburne sponsored Grant&#x27;s promotion to brigadier general and command of a brigade, and supported his subsequent promotion to major general and assignments to district, field army, and military division command. Washburne was also an advocate for Grant&#x27;s promotion to lieutenant general and command of the entire Union Army. During the war Grant aligned himself with the Republican goals of ending slavery and incorporating African Americans into the military. His changed political outlook and success on the battlefield made him a likely contender for president as a Republican, and Washburne supported Grant&#x27;s successful campaign in 1868.

===Investigation into Western War Department===
During the first months of the Civil War under President Lincoln, Washburne launched an investigation into corruption charges of General John C. Frémont&#x27;s Western War Department. Lincoln had appointed Frémont commander of the Western War Department in July 1861. Rumors spread of a &quot;horde of pirates&quot; under Frémont&#x27;s authority of defrauding the army and the federal government and that Frémont himself was &quot;extravagant&quot;. Washburne&#x27;s investigation revealed that Frémont had awarded his California associates with lucrative army contracts. Also Frémont had favored sellers who were given exorbitant contracts for railroad cars, horses, mules, tents, and equipment that was inferior in quality. In October, Lincoln relieved Frémont of command on corruption charges and for insubordination.

===Radical Republican leader===
Washburne became a leader of the Radical Republicans, those most ardently opposed to slavery, and was among the original proponents of racial equality. As a congressman, he served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After the Civil War, Washburne advocated that large plantations be divided up to provide compensatory property for freed slaves.

==Secretary of State (1869)==

When Grant became president in 1869, he appointed Washburne to succeed William H. Seward as Secretary of State, with the understanding that he would hold the post only briefly and then serve as minister to France.

===Illness and resignation===

He became ill after becoming Secretary of State, and resigned after only eleven days; his term remains the shortest of any Secretary of State.

==Minister to France (1869–1877)==
As Minister to France, Washburne played a major diplomatic and humanitarian role during the Franco-Prussian War. This was the first major war in which all belligerents appointed protecting powers to represent their interests in enemy capitals, and the United States agreed to be the protecting power for the North German Confederation and several of the German states. Washburne arranged for railroad transportation to evacuate 30,000 German civilians who had been living in France, and was responsible for feeding 3,000 Germans during the Siege of Paris. Although the State Department gave him permission to evacuate the American Legation at his discretion, Washburne chose to remain in Paris throughout the war and the Commune of Paris.

Washburne was the only diplomat from a major power to remain in the French capital through the Siege of Paris. As protecting power, he transmitted messages between the French and German governments. He was permitted by the Germans to receive sealed diplomatic communications from outside the city, a privilege that was denied to the smaller neutrals. Washburne was also entrusted with the protection of seven Latin American consulates that lacked diplomatic representation in France. The French Republic finally exchanged chargés d&#x27;affaires with the German Empire in June 1871, after an eleven-month breach in diplomatic relations between France and Germany. Washburne, who had lost 17 pounds during the ordeal, returned immediately to the Carlsbad springs to recuperate; he had been visiting the springs when he learned of the start of the war.

Washburne&#x27;s tireless efforts set a precedent for the role of protecting power in future wars. He received special honors from German Emperor Wilhelm I and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as well as from the French leaders Léon Gambetta and Adolphe Thiers.

==Presidential candidate (1880)==
Washburne left France at the end of Grant&#x27;s term in 1877, and returned to Galena. When Grant decided to run for an unprecedented third term in 1880, Washburne agreed to support him, and disavowed attempts by his own supporters to make Washburne a candidate. Despite Washburne&#x27;s disavowals, he was a contender at the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago. With 379 votes required to win the nomination, he consistently received support from 30 to 40 delegates; Grant had been the early front runner, and consistently received between 300 and 315 votes. Recognizing after more than 30 ballots that neither Grant nor the other leading contenders, James G. Blaine and John Sherman could be nominated, delegates began to search for a dark horse. Having failed to build momentum for Washburne on an earlier ballot, on the 34th ballot 16 Washburne delegates from Wisconsin cast their votes for James A. Garfield without warning. This surprise action started a groundswell of support for Garfield, and he was nominated on the 36th ballot.

Most of Grant&#x27;s delegates held firm even as most of those supporting Blaine and Sherman shifted to Garfield. Grant was angry at Washburne, believing that Washburne had not strongly supported Grant&#x27;s candidacy, as Washburne had pledged to do. Grant was convinced that if Washburne&#x27;s delegates switched to him, it might have generated momentum sufficient for him to win the nomination. For Washburne&#x27;s part, he believed that if Grant had withdrawn, as Blaine and Sherman had, Washburne and not Garfield might have been the dark horse who obtained the nomination. Grant and Washburne never met each other again and their friendship ended.

==Retirement==
In 1882, Washburne published a biography of former Illinois governor Edward Coles, an anti-slavery Virginian who had emancipated his slaves. Washburne later moved to Chicago, and he served as president of the Chicago Historical Society from 1884 to 1887. In 1887, he published a memoir of his time as a diplomat, &quot;Recollections of a Minister to France&quot;.

==Death and burial==
Washburne died at his son Hempstead&#x27;s home in Chicago on October 22, 1887, following a two-week period of ill health and a heart ailment. His wife had died only a few months earlier. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Galena.

==Physical description and character==

Washburne was a tall, broad shouldered man, having light gray eyes. Washburne was respected as a person of honesty and seriousness. When he moved west to Galena, Washburne vowed he would not drink, smoke, play cards, or attend the theater. After his marriage to Adele Gratiot in 1845, he adopted the practice of drinking a single glass of wine with dinner.

==Notable relatives==
Three of Washburne&#x27;s brothers (Cadwallader C. Washburn, William D. Washburn, and Israel Washburn, Jr.) also became politicians. His son, Hempstead Washburne, was the 32nd Mayor of Chicago serving from 1891 to 1893.

==Honors==
In 1885 Washburne received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Bowdoin College.

Washburne Avenue at 1232 South in Chicago is named in honor of Elihu Washburne.

<doc id="548977" wikidata="Q800829" url="?curid=548977" title="Gospel Oak railway station">
<text>Gospel Oak is a London Overground interchange station in the London Borough of Camden in north-west London. It is the western terminus of the Suffragette line to and from Barking Riverside, and is also situated on the Mildmay line between Clapham Junction/Richmond and Stratford. Passengers using Oyster cards are required to tap on interchange Oyster card readers when changing between the two lines. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==

The station opened in 1860 as Kentish Town on the Hampstead Junction Railway from to Old Oak Common Junction south of . It was renamed Gospel Oak in 1867 when a new station more appropriately named Kentish Town was opened about a mile south on the same line (that station is now ). Due to financial constraints a planned connection from the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway to Gospel Oak station was not added until 4 June 1888, some 20 years after that railway opened, and then without a link to the North London line due to other companies&#x27; opposition.

The station was rebuilt by the London Midland Region of British Railways in 1954.

From 1926 to 1981, the station was not a passenger interchange: passenger trains left the Barking line at Tufnell Park and descended the gradient to station. In 1981 that passenger service from Barking was diverted from Kentish Town to Gospel Oak with the terminal platform rebuilt on the north side of the existing station.

The North London Line through Gospel Oak was electrified on the fourth-rail 660 volt DC system in 1916 by the LNWR: in the 1970s that was changed to 750 volt DC third rail. In 1996, the line from Willesden through Gospel Oak to Camden was closed during conversion to 25 kv AC overhead.

To allow four-car trains to run on the London Overground network, the North London Line between this station and closed from February 2010 to 1 June 2010, for installing a new signalling system and for extending 30 platforms. Until May 2011, there was a reduced service with no services on Sundays while the upgrade work continued.

The platforms are high above street level with stairs and two lifts, one serving westbound trains, and one serving eastbound trains and the Suffragette line. The Mildmay line has two platforms and the Suffragette line has a short terminal platform north of which are two separate through freight tracks which join the NLL just west of the station. Oyster ticket barriers are in operation.

==Services==
All services at Gospel Oak are operated by London Overground using and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 8 tph to via 
* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to

<doc id="548981" wikidata="Q193592" url="?curid=548981" title="Midfielder">
<text>In the sport of association football, a midfielder takes an outfield position primarily in the middle of the pitch. Midfielders may play an exclusively defensive role, breaking up attacks, and are in that case known as defensive midfielders. As central midfielders often go across boundaries, with mobility and passing ability, they are often referred to as deep-lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box midfielders, or holding midfielders. There are also attacking midfielders with limited defensive assignments.

The size of midfield units on a team and their assigned roles depend on which formation is used; the unit of these players on the pitch is commonly referred to as the midfield. Its name derives from the fact that midfield units typically make up the in-between units to the defensive units and forward units of a formation.

Managers frequently assign one or more midfielders to disrupt the opposing team&#x27;s attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match. Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, and thus they are some of the fittest players on the pitch. Midfielders are often assigned the task of assisting forwards to create scoring opportunities.

==Central midfielder==

Central or centre midfielders are players whose role is divided mostly equally between attacking and defensive duties to control the play in and around the centre of the pitch. These players will try to pass the ball to the team&#x27;s attacking midfielders and forwards and may also help their team&#x27;s attacks by making runs into the opposition&#x27;s penalty area and attempting shots on goal themselves. They also provide secondary support to attackers, both in and out of possession.

When the opposing team has the ball, a central midfielder may drop back to protect the goal or move forward and press the opposition ball-carrier to recover the ball. A centre midfielder defending their goal will move in front of their centre-backs to block long shots by the opposition and track opposition midfielders making runs towards the goal.

The 4–3–3 and 4–5–1 formations each use three central midfielders. The 4−4−2 formation may use two central midfielders, and in the 4–2–3–1 formation one of the two deeper midfielders may be a central midfielder. Prominent central midfielders are known for their ability to pace the game when their team is in possession of the ball, by dictating the tempo of play from the centre of the pitch.

=== Box-to-box midfielder ===
The term &quot;box-to-box midfielder&quot; refers to central midfielders who are hard-working and who have good all-round abilities, which makes them skilled at both defending and attacking. These players can therefore track back to their own box to make tackles and block shots and also carry the ball forward or run to the opponents&#x27; box to try to score. Beginning in the mid-2000s, the change of trends and the decline of the standard 4–4–2 formation (in many cases making way for the 4–2–3–1 and 4–3–3 formations) imposed restrictions on the typical box-to-box midfielders of the 1980s and 1990s, as teams&#x27; two midfield roles were now often divided into &quot;holders&quot; or &quot;creators&quot;, with a third variation upon the role being described as that of a &quot;carrier&quot; or &quot;surger&quot;. Some notable examples of box-to-box midfielders are Lothar Matthäus, Clarence Seedorf, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Steven Gerrard, Johan Neeskens, Sócrates, Yaya Touré, Arturo Vidal, Patrick Vieira, Frank Lampard, Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, and more recently, Jude Bellingham.

=== Mezzala ===
In Italian football, the term &quot;mezzala&quot; (literally &quot;half-winger&quot; in Italian) is used to describe the position of the one or two central midfielders who play on either side of a holding midfielder and/or playmaker. The term was initially applied to the role of an inside forward in the WM and &quot;Metodo&quot; formations in Italian, but later described a specific type of central midfielder. The Mezzala is often a quick and hard-working attack-minded midfielder, with good skills and noted offensive capabilities, as well as a tendency to make overlapping attacking runs, but also a player who participates in the defensive aspect of the game, and who can give width to a team by drifting out wide; as such, the term can be applied to several different roles. In English, the term has come to be seen as a variant of the box-to-box midfielder role.

=== Wide midfielder ===
Left and right midfielders have a role balanced between attack and defence while they play a lot of crosses in the box for forwards. They are positioned closer to the touchlines of the pitch. They may be asked to cross the ball into the opponent&#x27;s penalty area to make scoring chances for their teammates, and when defending they may put pressure on opponents who are trying to cross.

Common modern formations that include left and right midfielders are the 4−4−2, the 4−4−1−1, the 4–2–3–1 and the 4−5−1 formations. Jonathan Wilson describes the development of the 4−4−2 formation: &quot;…the winger became a wide midfielder, a shuttler, somebody who might be expected to cross a ball but was also meant to put in a defensive shift.&quot; Two notable examples of wide midfielders are David Beckham and Ryan Giggs.

In Italian football, the role of the wide midfielder is known as &quot;tornante di centrocampo&quot; or simply &quot;tornante&quot; (&quot;returning&quot;); it originated from the role of an outside forward, and came to be known as such as it often required players in this position to track back and assist the back-line with defensive duties, in addition to aiding the midfield and attacking.

===Wing-half===

The historic position of wing-half (not to be confused with &quot;mezzala&quot;) was given to midfielders (half-backs) who played near the side of the pitch. It became obsolete as wide players with defensive duties have tended to become more a part of the defence as full-backs.

==Defensive midfielder==
Defensive midfielders are midfield players who focus on protecting their team&#x27;s goal. These players may defend a zone in front of their team&#x27;s defence, or man mark specific opposition attackers. Defensive midfielders may also move to the full-back or centre-back positions if those players move forward to join in an attack.
Sergio Busquets described his attitude: &quot;The coach knows that I am an obedient player who likes to help out and if I have to run to the wing to cover someone&#x27;s position, great.&quot; A good defensive midfielder needs good positional awareness, anticipation of the opponent&#x27;s play, marking, tackling, interceptions, passing and great stamina and strength (for their tackling). In South American football, this role is known as a &quot;volante de marca&quot;, while in Mexico it is known as &quot;volante de contención&quot;. In Portugal, it is instead known as &quot;trinco&quot;.

=== Holding midfielder ===
A holding or deep-lying midfielder stays close to their team&#x27;s defence, while other midfielders may move forward to attack. The holding midfielder may also have responsibilities when their team has the ball. This player will make mostly short and simple passes to more attacking members of their team but may try some more difficult passes depending on the team&#x27;s strategy. Marcelo Bielsa is considered a pioneer in the use of a holding midfielder in defence. This position may be seen in the 4–2–3–1 and 4–4–2 diamond formations. Writer Jonathan Wilson has identified three different types of holding midfielder, namely the &quot;destroyer&quot;, the &quot;creator&quot;, and the &quot;carrier&quot;.

Initially, a defensive midfielder, or &quot;destroyer&quot;, and a playmaker, or &quot;creator&quot;, were often fielded alongside each other as a team&#x27;s two holding central midfielders. The destroyer was usually responsible for making tackles, regaining possession, and distributing the ball to the creator, while the creator was responsible for retaining possession and keeping the ball moving, often with long passes out to the flanks, in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or &quot;regista&quot; (see below). Earlier examples of a destroyer are Nobby Stiles, Herbert Wimmer, and Marco Tardelli, while later examples include Claude Makélélé and Javier Mascherano, although several of these players also possessed qualities of other types of midfielders, and were therefore not confined to a single role. Early examples of a creator would be Gérson, Glenn Hoddle, and Sunday Oliseh, while more recent examples are Xabi Alonso, as well as Michael Carrick and Keira Walsh.

The latest and third type of holding midfielder developed as a box-to-box midfielder, or &quot;carrier&quot; or &quot;surger&quot;, neither entirely destructive nor creative, who is capable of winning back possession and subsequently advancing from deeper positions either by distributing the ball to a teammate and making late runs into the box, or by carrying the ball themselves; recent examples of this type of player are Clarence Seedorf and Bastian Schweinsteiger, while Sami Khedira and Fernandinho are destroyers with carrying tendencies. Luka Modrić is a carrier with several qualities of the &quot;regista&quot;, and Yaya Touré was a carrier who became a playmaker later in his career after losing his stamina. N&#x27;Golo Kanté started out as the quintessential destroyer, but developed carrying tendencies under Antonio Conte at Chelsea.

=== Deep-lying playmaker ===
A deep-lying playmaker (Strolling 10) is a holding midfielder who specialises in ball skills such as passing, rather than defensive skills like tackling. When this player has the ball, they may attempt longer or more complex passes than other holding players. They may try to set the tempo of their team&#x27;s play, retain possession, or build plays through short exchanges, or they may try to pass the ball long to a centre forward or winger, or even pass short to a teammate in the hole, the area between the opponents&#x27; defenders and midfielders. 

In Italy, the deep-lying playmaker is known as a &quot;regista&quot;, whereas in Brazil, it is known as a &quot;meia-armador&quot;. In Italy, the role of the &quot;regista&quot; developed from the centre half-back or &quot;centromediano metodista&quot; position in Vittorio Pozzo&#x27;s &quot;metodo&quot; system (a precursor of the central or holding midfield position in the 2–3–2–3 formation), as the &quot;metodista&quot;″s responsibilities were not entirely defensive but also creative; as such, the &quot;metodista&quot; was not solely tasked with breaking down possession, but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball.

Writer Jonathan Wilson instead described Xabi Alonso&#x27;s holding midfield role as that of a &quot;creator&quot;, a player who was responsible for retaining possession in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or &quot;regista&quot;, noting that: &quot;although capable of making tackles, [Alonso] focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack.&quot;
=== Centre-half ===
The historic central half-back position gradually retreated from the midfield line to provide increased protection to the back line against centre-forwards – that dedicated defensive role in the centre is still commonly referred to as a &quot;centre-half&quot; as a legacy of its origins. In Italian football jargon, this position was known as the &quot;centromediano metodista&quot; or &quot;metodista&quot;, as it became an increasingly important role in Vittorio Pozzo&#x27;s &quot;metodo&quot; system, although this term was later also applied to describe players who operated in a central holding-midfielder role, but who also had creative responsibilities in addition to defensive duties.

==Attacking midfielder==
An attacking midfielder is a midfield or forward player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team&#x27;s forwards, and who has a primarily offensive role.

Some attacking midfielders are called &quot;trequartista&quot; or &quot;fantasista&quot; (, i.e. a creative playmaker between the forwards and the midfield), who are usually mobile, creative and highly skilful players, known for their deft touch, technical ability, dribbling skills, vision, ability to shoot from long range, and passing prowess.

However, not all attacking midfielders are trequartistas – some attacking midfielders are very vertical and are essentially auxiliary attackers who serve to link-up play, hold up the ball, or provide the final pass, i.e. secondary strikers. As with any attacking player, the role of the attacking midfielder involves being able to create space for attack.

According to positioning along the field, attacking midfield may be divided into &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;central attacking midfield&quot; roles but most importantly they are a striker behind the forwards. A central attacking midfielder may be referred to as a &quot;playmaker&quot;, or &quot;number 10&quot; (due to the association of the number 10 shirt with this position).

=== Advanced playmaker ===

These players typically serve as the offensive pivot of the team, and are sometimes said to be &quot;playing in the hole&quot;, although this term can also be used as deep-lying forward. The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and dribbling, as well as, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence to deliver defence-splitting passes to the striker.

This specialist midfielder&#x27;s main role is to create good shooting and goal-scoring opportunities using superior vision, control, and technical skill, by making crosses, , and headed to teammates. They may try to set up shooting opportunities for themselves by dribbling or performing a give-and-go with a teammate. Attacking midfielders may also make runs into the opponents&#x27; penalty area to shoot from another teammate&#x27;s pass.
Where a creative attacking midfielder, i.e. an Advanced playmaker, is regularly utilised, they are commonly the team&#x27;s star player, and often wear the number 10 shirt. As such, a team is often constructed so as to allow their attacking midfielder to roam free and create as the situation demands. One such popular formation is the 4–4–2 &quot;diamond&quot; (or 4–1–2–1–2), in which defined attacking and defensive midfielders replace the more traditional pair of central midfielders. Known as the &quot;&quot;fantasista&quot; or &quot;trequartista&quot; in Italy, in Spain, the offensive playmaker is known as the &quot;Mediapunta&quot;, in Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the &quot;meia atacante&quot;, whereas in Argentina and Uruguay, it is known as the &quot;enganche&quot;. Some examples of the advanced playmaker would be Zico, Francesco Totti, Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona, Kevin De Bruyne, Wim van Hanegem and Michel Platini.

There are also some examples of more flexible advanced playmakers, such as Zinedine Zidane, Rui Costa, Kaká, Andrés Iniesta, Juan Román Riquelme, David Silva, and Louisa Cadamuro. These players could control the tempo of the game in deeper areas of the pitch while also being able to push forward and play line-breaking through balls.

Mesut Özil can be considered as a classic 10 who adopted a slightly more direct approach and specialised in playing the final ball.

=== Trequartista ===
The trequartista description has been used in Italian football to describe a player who is seemingly playing as an attacking midfielder in a 4–3–1–2 formation, but who eventually drops deeper into midfield, drawing opposing players out of position and creating space to be exploited by teammates making attacking runs; the trequartista will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a deep-lying playmaker. The trequartista is, therefore, usually a creative and tactically intelligent player with good vision, technique, movement, passing ability, and striking ability from a distance. They should also be a hard-working player, who is able to read the game and help the team defensively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Rooney has been deployed in a similar role, on occasion; seemingly positioned as a number 10 behind the main striker, he would often drop even deeper into midfield to help his team retrieve possession and start attacks.

=== &quot;False 10&quot; or &quot;central winger&quot; ===
The &quot;false 10&quot; or &quot;central winger&quot; is a type of midfielder, which differs from the trequartista. Much like the &quot;false 9&quot;, their specificity lies in the fact that, although they seemingly play as an attacking midfielder on paper, unlike a traditional playmaker who stays behind the striker in the centre of the pitch, the false 10&#x27;s goal is to move out of position and drift wide when in possession of the ball to help both the wingers and fullbacks to overload the flanks. This means two problems for the opposing midfielders: either they let the false 10 drift wide, and their presence, along with both the winger and the fullback, creates a three-on-two player advantage out wide; or they follow the false 10, but leave space in the centre of the pitch for wingers or onrushing midfielders to exploit. False 10s are usually traditional wingers who are told to play in the centre of the pitch, and their natural way of playing makes them drift wide and look to provide deliveries into the box for teammates. On occasion, the false-10 can also function in a different manner alongside a false-9, usually in a 4–6–0 formation, disguised as either a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation. When other forwards or false-9s drop deep and draw defenders away from the false-10s, creating space in the middle of the pitch, the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by exploiting this space and moving out of position once again, often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward towards goal, or running on to passes from false-9s, which in turn enables them to create goalscoring opportunities or go for goal themselves.

==Winger==


In modern football, the terms winger or wide player refer to a non-defender who plays on the left or right sides of the pitch. These terms can apply to left or right forwards. Left or right-sided defenders such as wing-backs or left or right midfielders, left or right attacking midfielders, or full-backs are generally not called wingers.

In the 2−3−5 formation popular in the late 19th century wingers remained mostly near the touchlines of the pitch, and were expected to cross the ball for the team&#x27;s inside and centre forwards. Traditionally, wingers were purely attacking players and were not expected to track back and defend. This began to change in the 1960s. In the 1966 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey did not select wingers from the quarter-final onwards. This team was known as the &quot;Wingless Wonders&quot; and led to the modern 4–4–2 formation.

This has led to most modern wide players having a more demanding role in the sense that they are expected to provide defensive cover for their full-backs and track back to repossess the ball, as well as provide skilful crosses for centre forwards and strikers. Some forwards are able to operate as wingers behind a lone striker. In a three-man midfield, specialist wingers are sometimes deployed down the flanks alongside the central midfielder or playmaker.

Even more demanding is the role of wing-back, where the wide player is expected to provide both defence and attack. As the role of winger can be classed as a forward or a midfielder, this role instead blurs the divide between defender and midfielder. Italian manager Antonio Conte has been known to use wide midfielders or wingers who act as wing-backs in his trademark 3–5–2 and 3–4–3 formations, for example; these players are expected both to push up and provide width in attack as well as track back and assist their team defensively.

On occasion, the role of a winger can also be occupied by a different type of player. For example, certain managers have been known to use a &quot;wide target man&quot; on the wing, namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward, and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank, or drag full-backs out of position; Romelu Lukaku, for example, has been used in this role on occasion. Another example is Mario Mandžukić under manager Massimiliano Allegri at Juventus during the 2016–17 season; normally a striker, he was instead used on the left flank, and was required to win aerial duels, hold up the ball, and create space, as well as being tasked with pressing opposing players.

Today, a winger is usually an attacking midfielder who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. Wingers such as Stanley Matthews or Jimmy Johnstone used to be classified as outside forwards in traditional W-shaped formations, and were formally known as &quot;Outside Right&quot; or &quot;Outside Left&quot;, but as tactics evolved through the last 40 years, wingers have dropped to deeper field positions and are now usually classified as part of the midfield, usually in 4–4–2 or 4–5–1 formations (but while the team is on the attack, they tend to resemble 4–2–4/2–4–4 and 4–3–3 formations respectively).

The responsibilities of the winger include:
* Providing a &quot;wide presence&quot; as a passing option on the flank.
* To beat the opposing full-back either with skill or with speed.
* To read passes from the midfield that give them a clear crossing opportunity, when going wide, or that give them a clear scoring opportunity, when cutting inside towards the goal.
* To double up on the opposition winger, particularly when they are being &quot;double-marked&quot; by both the team&#x27;s full back and winger.

The prototypical winger is fast, tricky and enjoys &#x27;hugging&#x27; the touchline, that is, running downfield close to the touchline and delivering crosses. However, players with different attributes can thrive on the wing as well. Some wingers prefer to cut &quot;infield&quot; (as opposed to staying wide) and pose a threat as playmakers by playing diagonal passes to forwards or taking a shot at goal. Even players who are not considered quick, have been successfully fielded as wingers at club and international level for their ability to create play from the flank. Occasionally wingers are given a free role to roam across the front line and are relieved of defensive responsibilities. Johann Cruijff frequently exhibited this prowess, as a true model of Total Football, an ultimate &quot;master-style&quot; of play, in its earliest form believed to originate with the Hungary national football team - and nearly perfected - in the late 40s and early 50s.

The typical abilities of wingers include:
* Technical skill to beat a full-back in a one-to-one situation.
* Pace, to beat the full-back one-on-one.
* Crossing ability when out wide.
* Good off-the-ball ability when judging a pass from the midfield or from fellow attackers.
* Good passing ability and composure, to retain possession while in opposition territory.
* The modern winger should also be comfortable on either wing so as to adapt to quick tactical changes required by the coach.

Although wingers are a familiar part of football, the use of wingers is by no means universal. There are many successful football teams who operate without wingers. A famous example is Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s late 2000s Milan, who typically plays in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a Christmas tree formation (4–3–2–1), relying on full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings.

===Inverted winger and raumdeuter===
An inverted winger is a modern tactical development of the traditional winger position. Most wingers are assigned to either side of the field based on their footedness, with right-footed players on the right and left-footed players on the left. This assumes that assigning a player to their natural side ensures a more powerful cross as well as greater ball protection along the touch-lines. However, when the position is inverted and a winger instead plays inside-out on the opposite flank (i.e., a right-footed player as a left inverted winger), they effectively become supporting strikers and primarily assume a role in the attack.

As opposed to traditionally pulling the opponent&#x27;s full-back out and down the flanks before crossing the ball in near the by-line, positioning a winger on the opposite side of the field allows the player to cut-in around the 18-yard box, either threading passes between defenders or shooting on goal using the dominant foot. This offensive tactic has found popularity in the modern game due to the fact that it gives traditional wingers increased mobility as playmakers and goalscorers, such as the left-footed right winger Domenico Berardi of Sassuolo who achieved 30 career goals faster than any player in the past half-century of Serie A football. Not only are inverted wingers able to push full-backs onto their weak sides, but they are also able to spread and force the other team to defend deeper as forwards and wing-backs route towards the goal, ultimately creating more scoring opportunities.

Other midfielders within this tactical archetype include Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard, as well as Megan Rapinoe of the USWNT. Clubs such as Real Madrid often choose to play their wingers on the &quot;wrong&quot; flank for this reason; former Real Madrid coach José Mourinho often played Ángel Di María on the right and Cristiano Ronaldo on the left. Former Bayern Munich manager Jupp Heynckes often played the left-footed Arjen Robben on the right and the right-footed Franck Ribéry on the left. One of the foremost practitioners of playing from either flank was German winger Jürgen Grabowski, whose flexibility helped Germany to third place in the 1970 World Cup, and the world title in 1974.

A description that has been used in the media to label a variation upon the inverted winger position is that of an &quot;attacking&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, or &quot;goalscoring winger&quot;, as exemplified by Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s role on the left flank during his time at Real Madrid in particular. This label has been used to describe an offensive-minded inverted winger, who will seemingly operate out wide on paper, but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals, effectively functioning as a striker. 

This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the &quot;raumdeuter&quot; role in German football jargon (literally &quot;space interpreter&quot;), as exemplified by Thomas Müller, as well as Dele Alli and Tim Cahill, namely an attacking-minded wide player, who will move into effective central attacking areas to find spaces from which they can receive passes and score or assist goals, while other teammates create space for their runs by drawing opponents away from them.

===False winger===
The &quot;false winger&quot; or &quot;seven-and-a-half&quot; is a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. Samir Nasri, who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a &quot;non-axial playmaker&quot;.

Aurelous was born in the Roman province of Dacia, north of the Danube, and prior to his military career served as a herdsman as well as Master of the Imperial Horses (&#x27;Phronistes&#x27;). His nomen is often reported as Acilius, while his praenomen is thought to be either &quot;Marcus&quot; or &quot;Manius&quot;, both of which were common praenomina within the Acilia gens. Although some historians such as John Platts, William A&#x27;Beckett and Angelo Paredi have thought the &#x27;M&#x27; to stand for a second nomen &quot;Manlius&quot;.

It is unclear whether Aurelous came to the attention of the Emperor Gallienus after enlisting in the army, or during his service as a groom. Gallienus was known to promote talent from outside the establishment, and Aureolus was one of the New Men who replaced senators in positions of high command in the army in the course of his reign.

===Career===
As a former Imperial Horsemaster, Aureolus developed a self-contained cavalry force to increase the effectiveness of the comitatus as a highly mobile field army under the Emperor&#x27;s direct control. Aureolus was the first commander of this force under the Emperor, and was based at Mediolanum (Milan).

Aureolus&#x27; cavalry was principally responsible for the defeat of the usurper Ingenuus at the Battle of Mursa (Osijek) in 258. In 261, he commanded the force which defeated the army of the usurpers Macrianus Major and Macrianus Minor in battle somewhere in the central Balkans. The army of the Macriani, which first supported usurper Ingenuus and then Regalianus, included inmates from garrisons in Danubian provinces and was estimated to be at least 30,000 strong.

The success of Aureolus in suppressing the Macriani is thought by some historians to have undermined the achievements of Gallienus. Other historians suggest that at this time Gallienus was attempting to crush the Gallic usurper Postumus, who murdered Gallienus&#x27;s son Caesar Saloninus, and clear the Juthungi out of the Alpine province of Raetia where they posed a direct threat to Italy and Rome.

===Rebellion===
After the Macriani were defeated and the Danubian garrison forces who had supported them were pacified, Aureolus and the Emperor united to defeat Postumus and his Gallic Empire. It may have been as a result of this campaign that the province of Raetia was recovered from the Gallic Empire and Postumus&#x27;s inscription on the Augsburg Altar was erased. However, Postumus managed to evade complete defeat, which some historians blame on the alleged &#x27;carelessness&#x27; of Aureolus. Other historians have suggested that Aureolus deliberately allowed the Gallic usurper to evade destruction to see Gallienus displaced as Emperor. 
Zosimus reported that Aureolus and two other officers conspired against Gallienus, but that all of them were punished and submitted, except Aureolus, who retained his anger against the emperor. The reasons for this are unknown, though it is speculated that as a Dacian Aureolus resented Gallienus for using the Dacian garrison to reinforce his field army for the defence of Italy, compounding the problems of barbarian incursions into Dacia. Despite his failure to destroy Postumus in Gaul, Aureolus was given sole responsibility for the campaign against the Macriani. However, when the Goths and Heruls invaded the Danubian provinces with an enormous force in 268, Aureolus was not even a senior officer of the Imperial &quot;comitatus&quot; that accompanied the Emperor against the marauders. He was instead made commander of the Raetian garrison while his cavalry went east with the Emperor under the command of Claudius (later the Emperor Claudius Gothicus) or Aurelian, who also became Emperor in due course.

Losing command of the elite cavalry is thought to have been a humiliating demotion for Aureolus, who deserted his Alpine command and invaded Italy and took his old base at Mediolanum. This treason caused Gallienus to break off his campaign against the Goths in the Balkans at a most critical moment to return to Italy to deal with Aureolus. Historians believe the longer-term consequences of Aureolus&#x27; rebellion opened Raetia to further invasion by the Alamanni who then went on to raid Italy itself in the early months of the reign of Claudius Gothicus. It may have been at this time that the Agri Decumates, the Roman lands north-east of the upper Rhine, were lost to the Empire.

From Mediolanum, Aureolus invited Postumus to challenge Gallienus for the Empire with his support. Using the Imperial mint in Mediolanum, Aureolus had coins struck bearing Postumus&#x27;s image as Emperor with appeals to the faith of his former comrades of the cavalry on the reverse. Postumus ignored his invitation and Aureolus, unsupported by the Gallic usurper, was defeated by Gallienus in a battle on the river Adda east of Milan at a place known for centuries as Pontirolo (from Latin &quot;Pons Aureoli&quot; i.e. &#x27;The Bridge of Aureolus&#x27;). He was then besieged in Mediolanum by Gallienus&#x27; military &quot;comitatus,&quot; including the cavalry which Aureolus had created.

===Death===
Following the conspiracy by the Praetorian Prefect, together with Aurelius Heraclianus, Claudius and Aurelian which saw Gallienus murdered, Aureolus as one of the Thirty Tyrants is thought to have attempted to take power himself. 
Aureolus surrendered to Claudius Gothicus, who succeeded Gallienus as Emperor. Before Claudius could decide his sentence, Aureolus was murdered by Claudius&#x27; Praetorian Guard as revenge for his rebellion against Gallienus.

<text>The Gospel Oak to Barking line, also shortened to GOBLIN, is a railway line in London. It is in length and carries both through goods trains and London Overground passenger trains, connecting Gospel Oak in north London and Barking Riverside in east London. The line is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 6, and is classified as a London and South East Commuter line.

On 15 February 2024, Transport for London announced that the Overground service which runs on the line will be branded as the Suffragette line, with the new name coming into use in November 2024.

For much of its existence the line has played a minor role in London&#x27;s transport system; however, in recent years it has received significant investment to increase its capacity, including full 25kV AC overhead electrification, completed in 2018. At the eastern end of the line, the extension to the Barking Riverside regeneration site opened on 18 July 2022.

==History==
=== Original lines ===
The line is mostly an amalgamation of lines built in the 19th century. The main section, between South Tottenham and Woodgrange Park, was built as the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway, a joint project between the Midland Railway and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. This opened on 9 July 1894, linking the Midland and Great Eastern joint line at South Tottenham and the Forest Gate and Barking line at Woodgrange Park. The section west of South Tottenham was built as the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, which opened in 1868 but had not been commercially successful as a stand-alone railway.

=== Predecessor routes ===
Although the route between Upper Holloway and Woodgrange Park has been constant, several stations have been the ends of the line. , , and Moorgate (via St Pancras) have all been the western termini. East Ham was an alternative eastern terminus for some time. Some trains were extended beyond Barking to destinations such as Southend and Tilbury. There was a regular boat train service between St Pancras and Tilbury.

A connection to Gospel Oak was added in 1888, but the routes via Kentish Town remained the primary ones and the Gospel Oak branch was abandoned during 1926. The connection to East Ham was abandoned in 1958.

The &quot;Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway&quot; section of the line had stations that were closed due to proximity to other stations or for other reasons. These include Highgate Road (closed 1918), Junction Road (closed 1943), Hornsey Road (closed 1943) and St Ann&#x27;s Road (closed 1942).

The line was considered for closure to passengers in 1963 as part of the Beeching Axe, but local users protested and formed an action group to prevent closure. Beeching&#x27;s proposals for London were not implemented for the most part, and the line remained open. Even so, it was allowed to fall into a poor state of repair and reliability, and by 1980 had been cut back to an hourly service between Kentish Town and Barking. The station canopies were gradually demolished, ticket offices closed and staff withdrawn from stations.

=== New link to Gospel Oak ===
During 1981, the situation began to improve when electrification and upgrades to the line out of (later part of Thameslink) displaced the line from Kentish Town. A new link to Gospel Oak was built and the hourly service from Kentish Town was replaced by the current route from Gospel Oak with two trains per hour. The service remained relatively unreliable, largely due to the age of the rolling stock used, which were initially Class 115 and 108 units, replaced in the early 1990s by Class 117 and 121 units.

=== Private operators ===

Initially part of British Rail Network SouthEast, the line was privatised in 1994, the track being owned by Railtrack (subsequently Network Rail) with the passenger service provided by the North London Railways franchise. This passed to National Express in 1997, which operated the line under the brand name Silverlink until November 2007. Under Silverlink, the slam door trains were replaced by Class 150 units in 2000, which improved reliability significantly. There were minor improvements in station facilities (such as CCTV and information points) but no major investment to upgrade the line and boost capacity, and the stations remained unstaffed.

=== London Overground ===

During the opening years of the twenty-first century, many lines within London were running at full capacity, and as a consequence the line took on a new strategic significance as a bypass, relieving load on other lines by allowing passengers to travel between north and east London directly.

The Railways Act 2005 abolished the franchise and gave the operation of passenger services to Transport for London (TfL). During 2005, TfL started funding a small number of additional peak time and late evening services to relieve the worst overcrowding.

In November 2007, TfL took full control of the line, after which it introduced improved late night and weekend services, and staff, ticket machines and Oyster equipment at all stations. The frequency was increased to three trains per hour during morning and afternoon peaks and the line was included on the Tube map for the first time.

The line was closed throughout most of September 2008 for upgrade work carried out by Network Rail. Capacity was increased from six trains per hour to eight (four each for passenger and goods trains). By replacing the overbridges carrying Sussex Way and Albert Road, and lowering the track in some other locations, it was made possible for W10 loading gauge goods trains to operate. Electrification was not included.

In 2010, eight new Class 172 Turbostar diesel trains replaced the Class 150 units, with two 23-metre coaches and the option to introduce a third coach. The service frequency was increased to four trains per hour in January 2011.

==== Electrification ====

During 2008, electrification was ruled out by the Mayor of London on grounds of cost and difficulty of electrifying a line with so many viaducts and bridges,&lt;ref name=&quot;1541/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the Network Route Utilisation Strategy published by Network Rail in October 2009 showed a benefit–cost ratio for the scheme of 2.4:1.&lt;ref name=&quot;1158/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, indicated that funding was &quot;a matter for the Department for Transport&quot;.

In 2011, Network Rail proposed electrification in Control Period 5 (CP5), however, in July 2012, Justine Greening, the Secretary of State for Transport, stated that electrification was not included in the High Level Output Specification for CP5, and that any funds would need to be provided by TfL. In August, the Mayor wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport to seek a way forward, and &quot;she committed her officials to support work with TfL, Network Rail, train operators and other industry parties to see if a viable way can be found to bridge the funding gap.&quot;

During November 2012, the magazine &quot;Modern Railways&quot; reported that the Department for Transport had ruled out the work on the basis of an estimated cost of £90 million, in contrast to an estimate of £40 million by TfL.

In June 2013, it was announced that £115 million of funding for electrification would be made available as part of upgrades to rail infrastructure included in the government&#x27;s 2013 spending round. At the same time Transport for London announced that they had obtained a £90m commitment from the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Transport.

In September 2015, Network Rail awarded the £56.9 million contract to electrify the line to J. Murphy &amp; Sons. There were part closures (at weekends and from South Tottenham to Barking) from June to late September 2016, followed by a full closure from October 2016 to February 2017. In February 2017, Network Rail announced that whilst the line would re-open as scheduled, they were not able to complete all the work planned due to &quot;incorrect&quot; designs and late delivery of materials. Further evening and weekend works until late June 2017 were already planned, followed by around four months of commissioning work before the electric wires could be turned on so that Class 710 trains could run. Although the line was completely electrified by mid-January 2018, delays prevented the introduction of new electric trains until 2019.

The line was electrified using the NR Series 2 OLE (Overhead Line Equipment) range.

==== New trains ====

On account of the completion of electrification in 2018, new electric Class 710 trains were supposed to run from March 2018. However, the delivery of these trains was delayed by the manufacturer; at one point, officials were not even willing to divulge an anticipated service date for the Class 710 sets.

Due to the Class 172 units being needed by West Midlands Trains, three Class 378 units (378 206, 378 209 and 378 232) were moved from other parts of the London Overground and shortened down from five to four carriages to provide an interim service until the class 710 units entered service. However, six trains are needed to be able to run a full service, so from 15 March 2019 (the day the last Class 172 units left London Overground) the frequency on the line was halved to two trains per hour.

Increases in passenger numbers led to severe overcrowding at peak times, but it was not possible to increase peak frequencies without reducing the number of goods trains, as the line could accommodate only eight trains per hour in each direction. The two-coach Class 172 diesel trains in use between 2010 and 2019 were incapable of handling the increased number of passengers experienced after the incorporation into the London Overground. Between 2016 and 2018 the line was electrified by Network Rail; this work was delayed due to a number of design, track works and delivery problems. At the same time, platforms were lengthened to accommodate the new four-coach electric Class 710 trains. These trains were intended to be introduced in the spring of 2018, but the delivery was delayed by the manufacturer, the first two entering service on 23 May 2019, but the existing two trains per hour service was maintained until the full timetable was restored in June of that year. The full fleet entered service in August 2019. Because the delay caused timetable cutbacks and continued overcrowding, TfL offered a month&#x27;s free travel, financed by the manufacturer Bombardier, to compensate passengers for the months of disruption they experienced.

==== Extension to Barking Riverside ====

The line was extended southeast by from the terminus at Barking to serve the Barking Riverside regeneration area, a brownfield site with permission for around 10,800 new homes. Proposed in the mid 2010s following cancellation of the DLR extension to Dagenham Dock, the extension was approved in 2017, leading to construction commencing during late 2018. Running partially alongside the existing London, Tilbury and Southend Railway line and then a new viaduct to the Barking Riverside station, the extension opened to passengers on Monday 18 July 2022 at an estimated cost of £327m.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 23 January 2020, a freight wagon derailed between Leyton Midland Road and Walthamstow Queen&#x27;s Road stations, causing extensive damage to more than 2.5 miles (4 km) of track; the line was closed between Barking and South Tottenham stations while repair works took place, whereby 10,000 tonnes of ballast, 5,300 concrete sleepers and 39 new pieces of rail were installed. The line re-opened on 19 February 2020.

==Current operations==

=== Stations ===
The line has thirteen stations, eleven of which are managed by London Overground, one by c2c (Barking) and one by London Underground (Blackhorse Road).

==== Station facilities ====
Except at the interchange stations, station facilities are very basic. There are small shelters, information points with recorded service information, information screens and CCTV cameras. Typically, there are one or two staff members on duty. Where there are no station buildings they operate out of container-sized portable offices.

==== Step-free access ====
The line has some stations with step-free access, allowing wheelchairs/pushchairs etc. easy access from street level to the platforms, at , , , , , Barking and .

As the trains do not align exactly with the platform height, wheelchair users require assistance from a member of staff to board or alight from trains. The only exception however is at the newest station on the line, Barking Riverside, built with level access.

=== Services ===
The line carries both goods and passenger traffic. It is owned by Network Rail, with the exception of the Barking Riverside branch which is owned by Transport for London. 

Passenger services on the line are operated by Arriva Rail London as part of the London Overground network under contract to TfL. There are four trains per hour in each direction, running from around 06:30 to 23:30 on Monday to Saturday, and around 06:30 to 22:00 on Sundays. There is a single weekday morning service from Woodgrange Park to Willesden Junction, calling at all intermediate stations except for Gospel Oak.

The line is heavily used by freight as it provides part of an orbital route around London, connecting with many radial routes and the North London Line at Gospel Oak. Freight services are operated by DB Cargo UK, GB Railfreight and Freightliner.

Other services use parts of the line infrequently, or as a diversionary route, but do not stop at most stations:
* c2c operates a few services on the east end of the line through Woodgrange Park
* London Overground runs a single Saturday service timetabled to connect Tottenham South Junction and Seven Sisters on Lea Valley routes passing through, but not calling at, South Tottenham station

The line has an active users&#x27; group, &quot;The Barking–Gospel Oak Rail User Group&quot;.

==== Renaming ====
In July 2023, Sadiq Khan, Head of TfL and Mayor Of London announced that it would be giving each of the six Overground services unique names, relevant to the &quot;historical contributions by minority groups&quot; of the area the service passes through, by the end of the following year. 

On 15 February 2024, it was confirmed that the service using the Gospel Oak to Barking line would be named the &quot;Suffragette line&quot;, to honour East London&#x27;s major contribution to the Suffragette movement. Barking activist Annie Huggett, who died in 1996 at the age of 104, was known as “The Last Suffragette” due to her great age. The line will be coloured green on the updated network map; green, along with white and purple, was one of the colours of the Suffragette movement.

=== Ticketing ===
Except at the interchange stations, staffed ticket offices were withdrawn by BR in the late 1980s. With operations transferred to London Overground, self-service ticket machines were introduced in November 2007. Oyster- and contactless-card validators (for touching in and out) are at all stations. The ticket machines can be used to load credit onto Oyster cards. Passengers are required to buy tickets, or touch in with their Oyster or contactless cards, or else face a penalty fare.

Owing to the lack of ticket barriers and the difficulty of ticket verification when trains are crowded, the line has historically had a high level of fare avoidance. Under Silverlink most stations lacked any ticket purchasing facilities. In theory, passengers could purchase tickets from the conductors on the trains, but it was not always possible to do this. Following the introduction of the current ticketing arrangements, ticketless travel fell from an estimated peak of 40% under Silverlink, to 2% in March 2008.

=== Passenger volume ===
The number of paying passengers has increased very significantly since London Overground assumed the line&#x27;s management.

This is the passenger volume for the years beginning April 2002 to April 2023.
==== Notes ====

* The large increases in the year beginning April 2006 were partly due to travelcards for National Rail journeys being made from stations that have only a London Underground office and also using a different methodology to estimate likely journeys made from National Rail stations in Zone 1.
* The large increases in the year beginning April 2010 were partly due to Oyster Cards being introduced in January 2010, and new rolling stock.
* Usage of the Gospel Oak to Barking line on the London Overground reduced as a result of engineering works throughout the year. Work included a full closure between October 2016 and February 2017.
* Barking Riverside opened in 2022.

===Trains===
Until 2010 London Overground operated six Class 150 two-coach diesel units on the line. They were replaced by eight Class 172/0 two-coach diesel multiple units (DMUs).

In 2017, all trains were diesel powered as the line was not fully electrified, with only two short sections having overhead electrification, at South Tottenham, to provide a link from Seven Sisters to Stratford, and from the junction with the Great Eastern Main Line to Barking but excluding the bay platform which this service uses. These sections were used only by occasional electric trains on other routes or by goods trains.

Electrification of the line was completed in 2018, but electric trains did not run at first as the delivery of the new Class 710 sets had been delayed. As the leases for the Class 172 came to an end in early 2019, London Overground temporarily shortened three of its Class 378s to run on the line to substitute the Class 172s until the long-delayed Class 710s entered service on 23 May 2019. All of the Class 378s were replaced by Class 710s by August 2019.

=== Interchanges ===

The line has same-station interchanges with:

* the North London Line at Gospel Oak
* the Victoria line at Blackhorse Road
* the Hammersmith &amp; City line, District line and c2c at Barking

There are out-of-station interchanges at:
* Harringay Green Lanes to Harringay on the Great Northern Route
* South Tottenham to Seven Sisters on the Seven Sisters Branch of the Lea Valley Lines and the London Underground Victoria line. (Signposting in the street does not indicate the pedestrian/cycle route between the two stations through Stonebridge Road.)
* Walthamstow Queens Road to Walthamstow Central on the Chingford branch of the Lea Valley Lines and the London Underground Victoria line. A footpath between the two stations, considerably shortening the foot journey between them, opened on 11 August 2014. While the footpath was first proposed in 1996, works had been delayed due to protracted legal battles over planning permission.
* Wanstead Park to Forest Gate on the Great Eastern Main Line
* Woodgrange Park to Manor Park on the Great Eastern Main Line

There are official TfL out-of-station-interchanges, whereby the passenger can continue an unbroken journey between:
* Upper Holloway and Archway on the Northern line
* Leytonstone High Road and Leytonstone on the Central line

Two other interchanges are walkable:
* Harringay Green Lanes and Manor House on the Piccadilly line
* Crouch Hill and Finsbury Park on the Piccadilly line and Victoria line

===Vibrations===
Residents in Walthamstow complained in 2012 that vibrations from goods traffic on the line were causing damage to their houses.

As part of the extension to Barking Riverside, a station, called Castle Green, at Renwick Road on the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway was proposed. Although not built as part of the extension to Barking Riverside, the station site was safeguarded so that it can be built at a later stage.

===Potential Abbey Wood extension===
Following the plan to extend the line to Barking Riverside, there were also proposals to extend the line further across the river to Abbey Wood via Thamesmead, to allow for easier Orbital journeys in East London, and provide Thamesmead with a railway connection for the first time. This was outlined in the R25 orbital railway proposal in 2014, and the potential of a future extension was mentioned in the inspectors report of the Transport and Works Order authorising the extension to Barking Riverside.

However, in 2019 Transport for London and City Hall proposed an extension of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) to serve Thamesmead instead of an extension of the Overground, as part of the proposed Thamesmead and Abbey Wood OAPF (Opportunity Area Planning Framework). A DLR extension was chosen due to lower connectivity benefits of an Overground extension, the low frequency (four trains per hour) of the Gospel Oak to Barking line, and — most significantly — a construction cost twice as much as the DLR, as the gradients required to cross the River Thames would require large scale tunnelling works when compared to the DLR. Despite recommending an extension of the DLR to Thamesmead, the consultation also noted that an extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line could provide good orbital transport links in the long term.

=== Other proposed changes ===

Local residents and users of the line have proposed adding a station between Leytonstone High Road and Wanstead Park to serve the Cann Hall area. The Leyton and Wanstead branch of the Labour Party has expressed an interest in the proposal. The line&#x27;s user group and Islington Borough Council have been pressing for the reopening of the station at Junction Road, as its proximity to Tufnell Park Underground station would allow interchange with the Northern line.

<text>Barking is an interchange station serving the town of Barking, east London. It is served by London Underground, London Overground and National Rail main line services. It is located on Station Parade, in the town centre.

On the London Underground, it is a stop on the District line and is also the eastern terminus of the Hammersmith &amp; City line. On the London Overground, it is on the Suffragette line. On the National Rail network, it is served by c2c services operating to and from . There is also interchange with London Buses and East London Transit routes on the station frontage. The Underground station is the busiest in the network outside of Zones 1 and 2.

The station was opened in 1854 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway as one of the first stations on the route. It was rebuilt in 1908 and again in 1959. , significant redevelopment of the station is ongoing.

==History==
===Pre-grouping (1854–1922)===
The station was opened as part of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR)&#x27;s new line which left the Eastern Counties Railway&#x27;s (ECR) main line at a new junction at Forest Gate. Two separate LT&amp;SR trains from London started at Fenchurch Street and Shoreditch and were combined at Stratford for the journey to Tilbury (and split at Stratford in the opposite direction). Barking at this time was a small village and the original station was a two platformed affair which opened on 13 April 1854.
Congestion at Stratford and deteriorating relationships between the lessees running the LT&amp;SR and the Eastern Counties Railway saw a new route built between Barking and Gas Factory Junction where the new route joined the London &amp; Blackwall Extension Railway, opening in 1858. Other than a new junction west of Barking (and west of the River Roding bridge) no changes were made at Barking and the original Forest Gate Junction section was then used by a goods trains and a rump Bishopsgate to Barking service operated by the ECR and after 1862 by the Great Eastern Railway.

Between the River Roding and the station there was a level crossing at Tanner Street and one on East Street at the east end of the station. Around 1860 some coal sidings were laid on the south side of the line west of the station.

The new Pitsea direct route opened in stages first to Upminster (1885), East Horndon (1886) and finally joining the existing Southend route at Pitsea in 1888. A new junction was provided 200 yards east of Barking station and this was controlled by a new signal box called Barking East Junction. The former Barking Junction box to the west was renamed Barking West Junction.

This station lasted until the 1880s when increasing passenger and goods traffic as well as issues with the level crossings at Barking (which was expanding) meant something needed to be done.
====1889 rebuilding====
The changes for the 1889 rebuilding were:
* An additional through platform on the down side of the station to allow the GE Liverpool Street service to run round away from the through platforms.
* The two existing platforms were extended to accommodate longer trains
* An up bay platform for departing services only
* New station building
* New cattle dock
No changes were made to level crossing arrangements despite increasing usage, although a number of minor foot crossings were closed in 1900/1901.

The rebuilding was in advance of the arrival in Barking of services from the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway (T&amp;FGR) which opened in July 1894. Although a joint venture between the LT&amp;SR and Midland Railway the majority of the services were operated by the latter company.
====Developments 1902–1908====
Around the turn of the century Barking Town Urban District Council were seriously concerned about the amount of time that East Street Gates were closed to road traffic. In 1902, the LT&amp;SR assisted when it made some minor changes to the signalling arrangements, and these were a prelude to further changes in the area. A new bridge over the River Roding was opened in 1900 and the original river bridge was replaced in 1903. The new scheme saw the Great Eastern/T&amp;FGR trains operating over the northern lines and the LT&amp;SR trains on the southern lines.

At the same time, the Whitechapel and Bow Railway (a joint LT&amp;SR/District Railway venture) was being built and when it opened, frequent District Line trains worked through to East Ham with a few extended through to Upminster. All trains were steam operated at this time.
The downturn in LT&amp;SR performance (and the upturn in Southend commuter traffic) saw the line from Bromley to East Ham quadrupled and electrified with electric District Line services terminating at East Ham from 1905.

The Little Ilford area to the west of the Rover Roding was developed between 1902 and 1908, and additional tracks extended to Barking (so there were now three pairs of tracks across the River Roding). The District Line electric services were now extended from East Ham and terminated at Barking (although a few steam worked District Line services worked through to Southend).

By this time, the LT&amp;SR, which had previously been resistant to closing the level crossing on East Street finally saw the need for a bridge and this was a key part of the rebuild. The station itself now consisted of eight platforms which by use were:

There was also an Up Rippleside Loop line for goods traffic and the goods yard was rebuilt west of the station.

Full District Line electric services to Barking commenced on 1 April 1908 and platforms 2 and 3 were electrified in 1911. The following year in 1912 the LT&amp;SR was taken over by the Midland Railway and following the 1921 Grouping Act that became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

===London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (1923–1947)===
The LMS and District Railway looked at an electrified extension to Upminster which involved new stations and an additional set of tracks with some changes to the east end of Barking station. The new section opened on 12 September 1932, and four years later the Metropolitan line started operating through Barking to Upminster as well.
During the Second World War Barking station was damaged by bombs in the blitz. The main incidents included:

===British Railways (1948–1994)===
The railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948, and Barking became a London Midland Region station for a brief period before transferring, along with the rest of the former LTS lines, to the Eastern Region on 20 February 1949.

In the early 1950s a major programme of works for the whole LTS line was developed consisting of:

* Electrification and re-signalling of the LTSR
* complete operational separation of the LTSR and District Line
* Simplification of freight operations centred on at Ripple Lane Marshalling Yard
* The rebuilding of Barking Station with a flyover for freight trains and cross platform interchange between underground and Southend line services. In order to improve the passenger interchange between District Line and British Rail (and vice versa) a dive-under was provided to the east of Barking and a second flyover to the west.

This work was delivered in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and from June 1962 all passenger services were worked by Class 302 Electric Multiple Units.

The station booking hall was completely rebuilt between 1959 and 1961 to designs by architect H. H. Powell with Project architect John Ward of British Railways Eastern Region Architect&#x27;s Department. Nikolaus Pevsner stated it was &quot;erected to coincide with electrification of the railway&quot; and that &quot;it is commensurately modern in outlook and unquestionably one of the best English stations of this date&quot;. The station was reopened by the Queen in 1961. It is now a Grade II listed building.

The LTS line and Barking station became part of the London and South Eastern sector of British Rail in 1982, and in June 1986 this was rebranded as Network South East (NSE). With the Conservative government of the early 1990s looking to privatise the railways, the operation of the NSE passenger train service was put under the control of a Train Operating Unit.

===The privatisation era (1994–present)===
The LTS line was privatised in May 1996, with a new company called LTS Rail (owned by Prism Rail) taking over operations of the services through Barking station. The owners of Prism Rail were bought out by National Express in 2000, and the line re-branded C2C. C2C was later bought out by Trenitalia who run the station today.

The infrastructure was initially run by Railtrack from 1994, but that company failed and was rescued by the government in 2001. A new company called Network Rail was formed to maintain the infrastructure.

===Accidents and incidents===
*In November 1923, a locomotive crashed through buffers at Barking and overturned, overhanging the road below.

==Design==

The station has four sets of stairs from the platforms to the overbridge and the booking hall. Four ramps connected by a subway give step free access between all the platforms. The stairs/ramps access platforms: i) 1/1a, ii) 2/3/4, iii) 5/6, and iv) 7/8. There is a lift between the booking hall and platforms 1/1a. This station has two bay platforms (no 1 and 3). Platform 1 was the terminal platform for the Gospel Oak to Barking line, before the line&#x27;s extension to Barking Riverside, and only used to be used by London Overground services. It was electrified in 2017 ready for the planned introduction of electric trains in 2018. Platform 3 is used by some LU trains on both lines that serve the station, but mainly the District line.

The ticket office is managed by c2c and has two serving windows (as at 2024, with redevelopment work still ongoing.) Tickets are available for National Rail, as well as London Underground. Oyster cards can also be issued at the ticket office. There are six self-service ticket machines, which can issue tickets ordered on line (Tickets on Demand or &#x27;TOD&#x27;). and sell Oyster products. (The four Shere Fastticket machines still on site as at 25 April 2018 have been taken out of service with effect from 1 April 2018, according to a sign posted on them.) Seven ticket barriers and a wide ticket gate control access to all platforms. There are sidings to the east which were built to accommodate D stock, C stock and S stock, though from 2017 only S stock is in service on the route. [Ticket machine info now out of date].

To the west of the station there are two railway overbridges. The westernmost carries the NR tracks to and from platforms 7 and 8 over the four tracks to and from platforms 2–6 to join the tracks to and from Woodgrange Park and beyond, facilitating c2c services to serve Stratford and Liverpool Street and, since July 2022, the London Overground extension to Barking Riverside.

The easternmost bridge carries the westbound Underground tracks from platform 6 over the NR tracks to and from platforms 4 and 5 to the southern side of the LU tracks from platform 2. This enables eastbound cross platform changes between LU trains on platform 2 and NR trains on platform 4.

To the east of the station a subway reverses the effect of the above bridge. This enables westbound cross platform changes between LU trains on platform 6 and NR trains on platform 5.

The stairs/ramp numbers are for clarity in this article; not in actual use.

===Redevelopment===
Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council has developed a Barking Station Masterplan for the redevelopment of the station, including the removal of retail units from the station concourse, expansion of ticket barriers, additional Oyster card machines, and new building work to provide replacement retail and to increase natural light within the station. In 2009, the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and it was planned to receive a share of £50m funding for improvements.

As part of the 2011 renewal of the Essex Thameside franchise it was proposed that ownership of the station could transfer to Transport for London. Following the 2010 general election the funding for planned works was withdrawn and the 2011 franchise renewal delayed until 2013. The new franchise invitation to tender proposes the transfer of building maintenance from Network Rail to the new operator, and includes an option to complete the redevelopment works. In 2012, the public space outside the station on Station Parade was re-ordered and repaved, using funding from Transport for London.

==Services==

On the Underground, it is served by the District and Hammersmith &amp; City (and two early morning Circle line services) lines and forms the eastern terminus for the Hammersmith &amp; City whilst District line services continue eastward to . The station is also served by National Rail (c2c) and London Overground (Suffragette line) services.

*London Underground: Some LU services run to/from &quot;the bay road&quot; (platform 3). Most Hammersmith and City line trains run directly to/from the sidings to the east where some trains are stabled overnight, and therefore use through platforms 2 and 6. S7 stock trains have seen regular service to Barking since 9 December 2012.
*If travelling west by Underground, it is usually best to take the first train from platform 6 and change west of Plaistow as necessary (the last opportunity to change between the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines being Aldgate East). Not only does this avoid the walk to the bay road at Barking, but it also may allow connecting with a train that starts at Plaistow, where there is a bay road used to terminate eastbound trains short, to recover time or for other operational expediency.
* London Overground trains on the Suffragette line have used platforms 7 and 8 since the extension to opened in July 2022. Class 710 electric trains are running here, replacing Class 378 electric trains borrowed from other Overground lines after electrification.

===Westbound===
The typical off-peak Monday to Friday trains per hour (tph) service is:
*8 tph to London Fenchurch Street (c2c).Platforms 5 &amp; 8. 
*6 tph to via (District line).Platforms 6 &amp; 3.
*3 tph to via Tower Hill (District line). Platforms 6 &amp; 3
*6 tph to via Tower Hill (District line)
*6 tph to Hammersmith (Hammersmith and City line). Platform 6 (and very few from 3).
*4 tph to (Suffragette line). Platform 7 (possibly 1 during disruption/engineering work)

===Eastbound===
*12 tph to (District line). Platform 2 (and doors also open to 1a).
*4 tph to Shoeburyness via Basildon (2 tph all stations and 2 tph semi-fast) (c2c). Platform 4.
*2 tph to Grays via Rainham (c2c). Platform 7.
*2 tph to Southend Central via Ockendon (c2c). Platform 4.
*4 tph to (Suffragette line). Platform 8
*6 tph terminating here (Hammersmith and City line). Nearly all platform 2.
*3 tph terminating here (District line). Platforms 2 &amp; 3.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 5, 62, 169, 238, 287, 366, 368, EL1, EL2, EL3, SL2, school route 687 and night route N15 serve the station.

<text>Swan Lee is a Danish indie rock band consisting of singer Pernille Rosendahl, guitarist Jonas Struck and drummer Emil Jørgensen. Swan Lee has released three albums on their own label GoGo Records: &quot;Enter&quot; (2001), &quot;Swan Lee&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Garden&quot; (2023). They have won Danmarks Radio&#x27;s P3 award, and are particularly known for the singles &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Love Will Keep You Warm&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1980s - 2001: Formation and the early years ===
Pernille Rosendahl, Jonas Struck and Emil Jørgensen met in Nykøbing Falster in the 1980s. Jonas Struck and Emil Jørgensen attended Nykøbing Falster Music School and later played together in the band Cactus Circle. In 1985, Emil Jørgensen and Pernille Rosendahl played together in the reggae band Rockae. In 2023, the band described to DR that they listened to music together in their teenage years, including jazz and psychedelic rock such as Pink Floyd, Charles Mingus, Savage Rose and John Coltrane&#x27;s Africa/Brass album.

In 1996, singer Pernille Rosendahl, guitarist Jonas Struck, drummer Emil Jørgensen formed a band. Under Pernille Rosendahl&#x27;s name, the group released the EP &quot;Dream Away&quot; in 1997 on Cannibal Records. In 1999 the band took the name Swan Lee, named after a Syd Barrett track. From 1998 to 2001, the trio sought out record companies to enter into a contract for an album release, but this resulted in rejection, as they could only see potential in Pernille Rosendahl as a solo artist. In 2001, the band borrowed DKK 350,000 to start their own record company GoGo Records and released their debut album Enter. Film director Christina Rosendahl, and sister of Pernille Rosendahl, depicted the band&#x27;s struggle to realize their dream of a record deal in the documentary &quot;Stjernekigger&quot; from 2002. With their self-releases, the band became a living example of entrepreneurship and gave lectures under the title &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; at Danish educational institutions. In the band and the record company, Emil Jørgensen was in charge of the contact with accountants and lawyers, Jonas Struck was bandmaster and Pernille Rosendahl was in charge of the graphic expression, etc.

=== 2001: &quot;Enter&quot; ===
In February 2001, their debut album Enter was released. The album sold 40,000 copies and peaked at No. 27 on the Danish album chart. Gaffa&#x27;s music critic Jan Opstrup Poulsen wrote &quot;Enter offers a sophisticated and experimental rock music that draws on the great known film themes and a backward approach to the musical expression.&quot; Pernille Rosendahl&#x27;s vocals were described by music critic Thomas B. Knudsen as &#x27;a unique voice that can vary from the violently grandiose to the frail and fragile.&#x27; The album was about growing up, and Pernille Rosendahl and Jonas Struck were the main composers behind the ten songs. The singles &quot;Stay Tonight&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; were filmed as music videos by Christina Rosendahl. The single &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, which was written in collaboration with Tim Christensen, was close to being chosen as the title tune for the James Bond film of the same name. The song was used in IO Interactive&#x27;s computer game in 2006.

In 2002, the band received Danmarks Radio&#x27;s P3 Prize and was nominated for six prizes with the Danish Music Awards; &#x27;Danish Group of the Year&#x27;, &#x27;Danish Album of the Year&#x27;, &#x27;Danish Singer of the Year&#x27;, &#x27;Rock Release of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;New Danish Name of the Year&#x27;. The single &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Danish Hit of the Year&#x27;.

The band debuted under the name Swan Lee, as support for Coldplay at a concert in Store Vega. In 2001, the band toured Denmark where they played, among other things, at Spillestedet Rust in Copenhagen, Gimle in Roskilde, Musikcafeen in Århus, Stars in Vordingborg, Studenterhuset in Odense, Roskilde Festival, Skanderborg Festival and Midtfyns Festival. They ended their tour with a sit-down concert &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&#x27;&quot; at Store Vega which included guest soloists, brass bands, cabaret dancers and film screening. In 2002, they were the warm-up band for the British group Suede on their European tour, where they performed in Brussels, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin, Oslo and Stockholm, among others.

=== 2004: &quot;Swan Lee&quot; ===
In 2004, the group released the album Swan Lee on GoGo Records, which sold over 20,000 copies in a day and a half and became a commercial success. The album reached number one on the album chart and the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; peaked at No. 3. Gaffa wrote &quot;Swan Lee is the most anticipated album here in time immemorial.&quot; The album went double platinum and sold over 80,000 copies. The singles &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot;, &quot;Love Will Keep You Warm&quot; and &quot;What is Love&quot; became No. 1 on the Danish charts. The album was produced in collaboration with Per Sunding from Tambourine Studios who introduced a more pop -inspired sound. In an interview in 2023, Pernille Rosendahl describes the creation of the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind,&quot; and how the collaboration with Per Sunding challenged the band&#x27;s sound and her vocals. The single is included on Playstation 2&#x27;s Singstar Legends. The singles &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; and &quot;Love Will Keep You Warm&quot; were filmed as music videos by Christina Rosendahl.

In 2004, the band toured Denmark and played over 50 concerts, including three selected shows in Store Vega. In the same year, the band performed at Arena at the Roskilde Festival, where Pernille Rosendahl sang a duet with Claus Hempler and the American soul singer Howard Tate. The band helped open the international music festival MIDEM in Cannes, where they promoted Danish rock and pop music with, among others, Kashmir and Tim Christensen. In the same year, the band performed together with the Danish Royal Chamber and the Royal Ballet with the single &quot;Lord Knows, I Can Be Strong.&quot; In 2005, they also played in Tokyo and in Nagoya in Japan in connection with the Expo 2005 exhibition.

In 2004, Pernille Rosendahl received the award as &quot;Singer of the Year&quot; at the Zulu Awards. In 2005, she received the award as &quot;Danish Singer of the Year&quot; at the Danish Music Awards.

Swan Lee chose to disband in September 2005, a few days before they were to have played with Nick Cave for the Danish Crown Prince Couple&#x27;s cultural award.

In 2007, the band released a compilation album The Complete Collection 1997-2005&quot; which also included cover versions of Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann&#x27;s &quot;Dansevise&quot; and New Order&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot;.
=== 2023: &quot;The Garden&quot; ===
In 2017, Jonas Struck helped with the creation of Pernille Rosendahl&#x27;s second solo album The Hurt, realizing that their creative vein was intact and giving them inspiration to later restore Swan Lee. They met with the drummer Emil Jørgensen for a lunch at Lumskebugten where they decided to create new music together again and restore the band.

After a 17-year hiatus, their third album The Garden was released on GoGo Records in January 2023. The album was produced in collaboration with Søren Buhl Lassen from Blaue Blume and recorded in his studio in Valby. The band also worked with the musician Teitur Lassen, and visited him in the Faroe Islands several times to write the songs &quot;The River,&quot; &quot;Nature&#x27;s Highway,&quot; &quot;Got Away With Murder&quot; and &quot;The Garden&quot;, among others. The majority of the album was created during the corona epidemic and with nature as inspiration, the songs deal with divorce, #metoo, love and friendship. The band has described the album as a collective voice and an affirmation of their close friendship and creative curiosity. The track &quot;I Am A River&quot; was inspired, among other things, by the double drum set on Savage Rose&#x27;s debut album &quot;Your Sign&quot;. The singles &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;How Forgiveness Goes&quot; achieved radio airplay. Berlingske music reviewer Nanna Balslev wrote &quot;Where in the 00s they made sharply defined pop-rock, the trio has re-emerged as a band that draws on longing Americana, cinematic synth surfaces, electronic undercurrents and acoustic guitars.&quot; Music reviewer Pernille Jensen from Politiken wrote &quot;&#x27;The Garden&#x27; sneaks up on you like an old flame suddenly standing in front of you after far too many years and still just, well, really lovely.&quot;

Their first live performance was as part of the Brodie Sessions in January 2023. They played three singles with Teitur Lassen. The band played at the Danish Crown Prince Couple Awards 2022, which was used to announce their comeback and this show was also their first live performance and TV show since 2005. As part of their spring 2023 tour, they launched a charity campaign in partnership with Save the Children. Here they sold t-shirts with the slogan &quot;Love Will Keep You Warm&quot; from their 2004 single of the same name, to benefit vulnerable children. In June 2023, Save the Children&#x27;s director Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen could announce that sales had exceeded more than half a million kroner.

<doc id="549000" wikidata="Q2118609" url="?curid=549000" title="Hallmark">
<text>A hallmark is an official mark or series of marks struck on items made of metal, mostly to certify the content of noble metals—such as platinum, gold, silver and in some nations, palladium. In a more general sense, the term &quot;&quot; is used to refer to any standard of quality. Not to be confused with responsibility marks that are the marks of the maker.

==General overview==
Historically, hallmarks were applied by a trusted party: the &quot;guardians of the craft&quot; or, more recently, by an assay office (). Hallmarks are a guarantee of certain purity or fineness of the metal, as determined by official metal (assay) testing. Hallmarks include information not only about the precious metal and fineness, but the country from which the item was tested and marked. Some hallmarks can reveal even more information, e.g. the assay office, size of the object marked, year the item was hallmarked - referred to as a (also known as date letter).

===Distinguishment===
Hallmarks are often confused with &quot;trademarks&quot; or &quot;maker&#x27;s marks&quot;. A hallmark is not the mark of a manufacturer to distinguish their products from other manufacturers&#x27; products: that is the function of trademarks or makers&#x27; marks. To be a true hallmark, it must be the guarantee of an independent body or authority that the contents are as marked. Thus, a stamp of &quot;925&quot; by itself is not, strictly speaking, a hallmark, but is rather an unattested fineness mark, generally stamped by the maker.

===Prerequisites to hallmarking===
Many nations require, as a prerequisite to official hallmarking, that the maker or sponsor itself marks upon the item a responsibility mark and a claim of fineness. Responsibility marks are also required in the US if metal fineness is claimed, even though there is no official hallmarking scheme there. Nevertheless, in nations with an official hallmarking scheme, the hallmark is only applied after the item has been assayed by an independent party to determine that its purity conforms not only to the standards set down by the law but also with the maker&#x27;s claims as to metal content.

===Systems===
In some nations, such as the UK, the hallmark is made up of several elements, including: a mark denoting the type of metal, the maker/sponsor&#x27;s mark and the year of the marking. In England, the year of marking commences on 19 May, the feast day of Saint Dunstan, patron saint of gold- and silversmiths. In other nations, such as Poland, the hallmark is a single mark indicating metal and fineness, augmented by a responsibility mark (known as a sponsor&#x27;s mark in the UK). Within a group of nations that are signatories to an international convention known as the Vienna Convention on the Control of the Fineness and the Hallmarking of Precious Metal Objects, additional, optional yet official, marks may also be struck by the assay office. These can ease import obligations among and between the signatory states. Signatory countries each have a single representative hallmark, which would be struck next to the Convention mark that represents the metal and fineness.

==History==

===Ancient Byzantine hallmarks===
The control or inspection of precious metals was an ancient concept of examination and marking, by means of inspection stamps (punch marks). The use of hallmarks, at first on silver, has a long history dating back to the 4th century AD—there is evidence of silver bars marked under authority of the Flavius Julius Constans around AD 350—and represents the oldest known form of consumer protection. A series or system of five marks has been found on Byzantine silver dating from this period, though their interpretation is still not completely resolved.

===Late Middle Ages===
From the Late Middle Ages, hallmarking was administered by local governments through authorized assayers. These assayers examined precious metal objects, under the auspices of the state, before the object could be offered for public sale. By the age of the craft guilds, the authorized examiner&#x27;s mark was the &quot;master&#x27;s mark&quot;, which consisted frequently of his initials and/or the coat of arms of the goldsmith or silversmith. At one time, there was no distinction between silversmiths and goldsmiths, who were all referred to as &quot;orfèvres&quot;, the French word for goldsmith. The master craftsman was responsible for the quality of the work that left his &quot;atelier&quot; or workshop, regardless of who made the item. Hence the responsibility mark is still known today in French as &quot;le poinçon de maître&quot; literally &quot;the maker&#x27;s punch&quot;. In this period, fineness was more or less standardized in the major European nations (writ: France and England) at 20 karats for gold and 12 to 13 lots (75% to 81%) for silver, but the standards could only be partly enforced, owing to the lack of precise analytical tools and techniques.

====France====
Hallmarking is Europe&#x27;s earliest form of consumer protection. Modern hallmarking in Europe appears first in France, with the Goldsmiths Statute of 1260 promulgated under Étienne Boileau, Provost of Paris, for King Louis IX. A standard for silver was thus established. In 1275, King Philip III prescribed, by royal decree, the mark for use on silver works, along with specific punches for each community&#x27;s smiths. In 1313, his successor, Philippe IV &quot;the Fair&quot; expanded the use of hallmarks to gold works.

====England====

In 1300 King Edward I of England enacted a statute requiring that all silver articles must meet the sterling silver standard (92.5% pure silver) and must be assayed in this regard by &#x27;guardians of the craft&#x27; who would then mark the item with a leopard&#x27;s head. In 1327 King Edward III of England granted a charter to the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths (more commonly known as the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company), marking the beginning of the company&#x27;s formal existence. This entity was headquartered in London at Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall, from whence the English term &quot;hallmark&quot; is derived. (In the UK the use of the term &quot;hallmark&quot; was first recorded in this sense in 1721 and in the more general sense as a &quot;mark of quality&quot; in 1864.)

====Switzerland====
In 1424, the French cardinal Jean de Brogny, after consulting a council of eight Master Goldsmiths from Geneva, enacted a regulation on the purity and hallmarking of silver objects (following the French standards) for application in Geneva. Although gold was used for articles, the regulation was silent on standards and hallmarking for gold.
In Switzerland today, only precious metal watch cases must be hallmarked. The hallmarking of other items including silverware and jewelry is optional.

===Augmentations in France and England===

*In 1355, individual maker marks were introduced in France. This concept was later mirrored in England in 1363, adding accountability to the two systems.
*In 1427, the date letter system was established in France, allowing the accurate dating of any hallmarked piece.
*In 1478, the Assay Office was established in Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall. At this time, the date letter system was introduced in England. This was originally intended to be the mark of an official known as the Assay Master, who was sworn in every May. After being sworn in, the letter would advance to the next in the alphabet, regardless of whether the same individual continued to hold the post, so it came to be regarded simply as a date letter.
*In 1544 a lion passant was added to English marks, to bring the number up to four.
*In 1697, a higher standard of silver, known as the Britannia standard (95.83%, i.e. 23/24ths silver) was made compulsory in Great Britain to protect the new coinage which was being melted down by silversmiths for the silver. The Sterling standard (92.5%) was restored in 1720.
*In 1784, the United Kingdom began charging a tax on silverware, and a further mark was added to indicate this had been paid. The mark was the monarch&#x27;s head and continued to be used until 1890, when the tax was abolished.

==Modern hallmarks==
In the modern world, in an attempt at standardizing the legislation on the inspection of precious metals and to facilitate international trade, in November 1972 a core group of European nations signed the Vienna Convention on the Control of the Fineness and the Hallmarking of Precious Metal Objects. Articles which are assayed and found by the qualifying office of a signatory country to conform to the standard, receive a mark, known as the Common Control Mark (CCM), attesting to the material&#x27;s fineness. The multi-tiered motif of the CCM is the balance scales, superimposed, for gold, on two intersecting circles; for platinum, a diamond shape and for silver a mark in the shape of the Latin letter &quot;M&quot;.

This mark is recognized in all the other contracting states, including: Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine (see links below). Other nations monitor the activities of the convention and may apply for membership.

Complete international hallmarking has been plagued by difficulties, because even amongst countries which have implemented hallmarking, standards and enforcement vary considerably, making it difficult for one country to accept another&#x27;s hallmarking as equivalent to its own. While some countries permit a variance from the marked fineness of up to 10 parts per thousand, others do not permit any variance (known as negative tolerance) at all. Many nations abide by the Vienna system and procedures are in place to allow additional nations to join the Vienna Convention. Similarly, with the consent of all the current member states, the terms of the convention may be amended.

The most significant item currently up for debate is the recognition of palladium as a precious metal. Some member nations recognize palladium as a precious metal while others do not.

===Poland===

Official French Hallmarks used between 1798 and 1972 for gold and silver.

===United Kingdom===

The Hallmarking Act 1973 (c. 43) made Britain a member of the Vienna Convention as well as introducing marking for platinum, a recognised metal under the convention. All four remaining assay offices finally adopted the same date letter sequences. In 1999 changes were made to the UK hallmarking system to bring the system closer into line with the European Union. Note that under this latest enactment, the date letter is no longer a compulsory part of the hallmark.

A legislative reform order (LRO) came into effect on 8 February 2013 giving UK assay offices the legal right to strike hallmarks outside of UK territory. In July 2016 Birmingham Assay Office began striking Birmingham hallmarks in Mumbai, India and further offshore offices are likely to be established. In March 2018 the British Hallmarking Council announced that UK assay office marks struck offshore must be distinguishable from those struck in the UK. It is likely that an &#x27;offshore&#x27; assay mark will have to be added to signify that the item was not assayed in the UK. Only London and Edinburgh assay offices now strike marks exclusively in the UK.

As it now stands, the compulsory part of the UK hallmark consists of the sponsor or maker&#x27;s mark, the assay office mark, and the standard of fineness (in this case silver, 925 parts in 1,000). 
These are shown in the top of the two example hallmarks. The bottom example shows the extra marks that can also be struck, the lion passant, indicating Sterling silver, the date mark (lowercase &quot;a&quot; for the year 2000), and in this example, the &#x27;Millennium mark&#x27;, which was only available for the years 1999 and 2000. The bottom example bears the Yorkshire rose mark for the Sheffield Assay Office.

The Hallmarking Act was amended in July 2009 to include palladium from January 2010.

===Switzerland===
Although hallmarking in the Swiss territories dates back to Geneva in the fifteenth century, there was no uniform system of hallmarking in Switzerland until 1881. Before that time, hallmarking was undertaken at the local level by the Swiss cantons. With the introduction of Federal hallmarking laws starting in 1881, increased uniformity was established.


Under the current law, on all gold, silver, platinum or palladium watches cases made in Switzerland or imported into Switzerland, there shall be affixed, near the Maker&#x27;s Responsibility Mark and his indication of purity, the official Hallmark, the head of a Saint Bernard dog. Only precious metal watch cases must be hallmarked. Swiss hallmarking for other articles such as jewelry and cutlery is optional.

In addition to the Swiss hallmark, all precious metal goods may be stamped with the Common Control Mark of the Vienna Convention.
===Netherlands===
The Netherlands, who are members of the International hallmarking Convention, have been striking hallmarks since at least 1814. Like many other nations, the Netherlands require the registration and use of Responsibility Marks, however, perhaps somewhat unusual, there is a book published entitled &quot;Netherlands&#x27; Responsibility Marks since 1797&quot; (in three volumes and in the English language) illustrating all the responsibility marks registered there since that time. This is significant since producers that exported precious metal goods to the Netherlands would have been required to register their marks.

The Dutch government markets their assay services/office as the &quot;Jewellery Gateway in and to Europe.&quot; The Netherlands&#x27; hallmarks are also recognized in other EU countries and thus can be sold in Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom without further testing. The Netherlands&#x27; hallmarks are also recognized in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which have voluntary hallmarking systems.

One of the two Dutch assay offices, WaarborgHolland b.v., is located in Gouda between the Amsterdam and Rotterdam airports. The other one is located in Joure, called Edelmetaal Waarborg Nederland b.v. The Netherlands recognises platinum, gold, silver and palladium as precious metals.

===India===
The BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) Hallmark is a hallmarking system for gold as well as silver jewellery sold in India certifying the purity of the metal. It certifies that the piece of jewellery conforms to a set of standards laid by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the national standards organization of India.

==Marking techniques==

===Punching===
Traditionally, the hallmarks are &quot;struck&quot; using steel punches. Punches are made in different sizes, suitable for tiny pieces of jewelry to large silver platters. Punches are made in straight shank or ring shank, the latter used to mark rings. The problem with traditional punching is that the process of punching displaces metal, causing some distortion of the article being marked. This means that re-finishing of the article is required after hallmarking. For this reason, and that off-cuts from sprues are often used for assay, many articles are sent unfinished to the assay office for assay and hallmarking.

===Laser marking===
A new method of marking using lasers is now available, which is especially valuable for delicate items and hollowware, which would be damaged or distorted by the punching process. Laser marking also means that finished articles do not need to be re-finished. Laser marking works by using high-power lasers to evaporate material from the metal surface. Two methods exist: 2D and 3D laser marking. 2D laser marking burns the outline of the hallmarks into the object, while 3D laser marking better simulates the marks made by punching.

==Methods of assay==
Precious metal items of art or jewelry are frequently hallmarked (depending upon the requirements of the laws of either the place of manufacture or the place of import). Where required to be hallmarked, semi-finished precious metal items of art or jewelry pass through the official testing channels where they are analyzed or assayed for precious metal content. While different nations permit a variety of legally acceptable finenesses, the assayer is actually testing to determine that the fineness of the product conforms with the statement or claim of fineness that the maker has claimed (usually by stamping a number such as 750 for 18k gold) on the item. In the past the assay was conducted by using the touchstone method but currently (most often) it is done using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). XRF is used because this method is more exacting than the touchstone test. The most exact method of assay is known as fire assay or cupellation. This method is better suited for the assay of bullion and gold stocks rather than works or art or jewelry because it is a completely destructive method.

===Touchstone===
The age-old touchstone method is particularly suited to the testing of very valuable pieces, for which sampling by destructive means, such as scraping, cutting or drilling is unacceptable. A rubbing of the item is made on a special stone, treated with acids and the resulting color compared to references. Differences in precious metal content as small as 10 to 20 parts per thousand can often be established with confidence by the test. It is not indicated for use with white gold, for example, since the color variation among white gold alloys is almost imperceptible.

=== X-ray fluorescence===
The modern X-ray fluorescence is also a non-destructive technique that is suitable for normal assaying requirements. It typically has an accuracy of up to five parts per thousand and is well-suited to the relatively flat and large surfaces. It is a quick technique taking about three minutes, and the results can be automatically printed out by the computer. It also measures the content of the other alloying metals present. It is not indicated, however, for articles with chemical surface treatment or electroplated metals.

===Fire assay===
The most elaborate, but totally destructive, assay method is the fire assay, or cupellation. As applied to gold bearing metallics, as in hallmark assaying, it is also known as cupellation and can have an accuracy of 1 part in 10,000. In this process the article is melted, the alloys separated and constituents weighed. Since this method is totally destructive, when this method is employed for the assay of jewelry, it is done under the guise of random or selective sampling. For example, if a single manufacturer deposits a lot of rings or watch cases, while most are assayed using the non-destructive methods a few pieces from the lot are randomly selected for fire assay.

===Other methods===
There are methods of assay noted above which are more properly suited for finished goods while other methods are suitable for use on raw materials before artistic workmanship has begun. Raw precious metals (bullion or metal stock) are assayed by the following methods: silver is assayed by titration, gold is assayed by cupellation and platinum is assayed by ICP OES spectrometry.

<text>The Computer Graphics Lab is a computer lab located at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT), founded by the late Dr. Alexander Schure. It was originally located at the &quot;pink building&quot; on the NYIT campus. It has played an important role in the history of computer graphics and animation, as founders of Pixar and Lucasfilm, including Turing Award winners Edwin Catmull and Patrick Hanrahan, began their research there. It is the birthplace of entirely 3D CGI films.

The lab was initially founded to produce a short high-quality feature film with the project name of &quot;The Works&quot;. The feature, which was never completed, was a 90-minute feature that was to be the first entirely computer-generated CGI movie. Production mainly focused around DEC PDP and VAX machines.

Many of the original CGL team now form the elite of the CG and computer world with members going on to Silicon Graphics, Microsoft, Cisco, NVIDIA and others, including Pixar president, co-founder and Turing laureate Ed Catmull, Pixar co-founder and Microsoft graphics fellow Alvy Ray Smith, Pixar co-founder Ralph Guggenheim, Walt Disney Animation Studios chief scientist Lance Williams, Netscape and Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark, Tableau co-founder and Turing laureate Pat Hanrahan, Microsoft graphics fellow Jim Blinn, Thad Beier, Oscar and Bafta nominee Jacques Stroweis, Andrew Glassner, and Tom Brigham. Systems programmer Bruce Perens went on to co-found the Open Source Initiative.

Researchers at the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab created the tools that made entirely 3D CGI films possible. Among NYIT CG Lab&#x27;s many innovations was an eight-bit paint system to ease computer animation. NYIT CG Lab was regarded as the top computer animation research and development group in the world during the late 70s and early 80s.

==The 21st century==
The lab is presently located at NYIT&#x27;s Long Island campus, and NYIT currently offers a Ph.D. program in Computer Science.

<text>The Travelcard is an inter-modal travel ticket for unlimited use on the London Underground, London Overground, Elizabeth line, Docklands Light Railway, London Trams, London Buses and National Rail services in the Greater London area. Travelcards can be purchased for a period of time varying from one day to a year, from Transport for London, National Rail and their agents. Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe or encoded onto an Oyster card, Transport for London&#x27;s contactless electronic smart card, or an ITSO smartcard issued by a National Rail train operating company. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport. One Day Travelcards and validity on other transport modes were added from 1984 onwards. The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers.

==History==

Before the introduction of the Travelcard, tickets for the London Underground were purchased on a &#x27;point-to-point&#x27; basis between two stations, either as a single, return or season ticket; and were priced according to distance travelled. Tickets for travel on London Buses and British Rail were purchased separately. The Travelcard was introduced as the third in a series of major fare revisions that had started in 1981. The introduction of the Travelcard was intended to increase patronage on London Underground and London Buses, particularly during less busy times and to speed up the boarding of bus services.

On 4 October 1981, following the Greater London Council election, the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named &quot;City&quot; and &quot;West End&quot;, where flat fares applied for the first time. This was accompanied by a cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the &quot;Fares Fair&quot; campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 London Bus fares were doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three-mile intervals; and thus grouping those stations within three miles of the central zones in an &#x27;inner zone&#x27;.

In 1983, a third revision of fares was undertaken, and a new inter-modal Travelcard season ticket was launched covering five new numbered zones; representing an overall cut in prices of around 25%. The &quot;One Day Travelcard&quot; was launched in 1984 and on weekdays was only sold for travel after 09:30. In January 1985 the &quot;Capitalcard&quot; season ticket was launched, offering validity on British Rail services as well as London Underground and London Buses. It was priced around 10–15% higher than the Travelcard. The card was marketed under the brand &quot;The London Connection&quot;, illustrated with an image of an electric plug bringing together the corporate identities of British Rail and London Transport. In June 1986 the &quot;One Day Capitalcard&quot; was launched. The Capitalcard brand ended in January 1989 when the Travelcard gained validity on British Rail and DLR services. In January 1991 Zone 5 was split to create a new Zone 6.

In January 2002 a peak version of the One Day Travelcard was introduced on weekdays, which allows travel between 04:30 and 09:30 and in 2005 a 3-day version of the Travelcard was launched (they were discontinued in 2010). Travelcard season tickets were made available on electronic smart cards, known as Oyster cards, from 2003 and by 2005 Transport for London ceased selling season tickets on paper tickets, although they continued to be available from National Rail stations until 1 June 2022.

In July 2023, TfL and the Mayor of London announced that from January 2024, one day Travelcards would no longer be sold or accepted on the TfL network, citing unfavourable revenue sharing terms between TfL and the Train Operating Companies on which the tickets are valid. 7-day and longer Travelcards will be unaffected. However, in October 2023, it was announced that due to a renegotiation on revenue sharing, one day Travelcards would be retained.

==Operation==
=== Usage ===
A Travelcard entitles the holder to unlimited travel in Greater London on London Buses, London Trams, London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, Elizabeth line and National Rail services. They provide travel within up to nine numbered concentric zones, with Zone 1 (which includes the central areas of The City and the West End) at the middle and Zone 9 (which includes suburbs outside Greater London such as Amersham and Brentwood). On the London Underground, London Overground, DLR and National Rail, the Travelcard is only valid within the zones indicated on the ticket. On London Buses any Travelcard, regardless of the zones, can be used on any route. On Tramlink any Travelcard valid in zones 3, 4, 5, or 6 can be used on any tram route. Travelcards are sold in a limited number of combinations of adjacent zones with different combinations available depending on the length of validity. Travelcards for only one zone are no longer sold, having been withdrawn in 2006. Travelcards valid for travel in Zone 1 (most of central London) are more expensive than those excluding it, although as of 2011 one-day travelcards not including Zone 1 are no longer sold.

Travelcards are issued for periods of one day or seven days, or for any period from one month to one year, known as a season Travelcard. One day Travelcards can be purchased in &quot;Anytime&quot; and &quot;Off-Peak&quot; variants. Anytime Travelcard and Off-peak Travelcard. An Anytime Travelcard may be used from 00:01 on the date of validity and an Off-peak Travelcard may be used from 09:30 on Monday to Friday, and whole day on weekends and public holidays, with both expiring at 04:29 the following day.

Travelcards for seven days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel at any time of the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10 months 13 days and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway.

As of 2022, Anytime Travelcard is only sold for zones 1–4, 1–6 or 1–9, while off-peak Travelcard is only sold for zones 1–6 or 1–9. Travelcard season tickets are sold for any consecutive zone combinations including at least 2 consecutive zones within 1–6, with tickets including zone 1 significantly more expensive, while season tickets for the outer zones are offered in the combinations 1–7, 1–8, 1–9, 2–7, 2–9 (including Watford Junction), 4–7 and 4–9 (including Watford Junction) only.

=== Sale ===
A Travelcard can be bought either from TfL or from National Rail:

* TfL-issued One Day Travelcards are sold at ticket machines at London Underground / DLR stations, TfL Visitor Centres, or Tramlink shop in Croydon, in form as a paper ticket only.
* National Rail issued One Day Travelcards are sold at ticket offices at National Rail stations, or bought from National Rail ticket retailers and collected at National Rail ticket machines / ticket offices and sold as a paper ticket. Some National Rail retailers also offer the option to load them into a National Rail ITSO smart card.
* A Travelcard season ticket can be bought from TfL at ticket machines at London Underground / DLR stations, TfL Visitor Centres, Oyster ticket shops, or online at the TfL Oyster Account, which must be loaded into an Oyster card at the point of purchase (or afterwards if bought online).
* A Travelcard season ticket can be sold by National Rail retailers and loaded into National Rail smart cards. As of 2022, an inboundary Travelcard season ticket (one valid within the numbered zones only) is sold on smart cards only, which include Oyster card (if sold by TfL) and National Rail ITSO smart cards (if sold by National Rail). Outboundary Travelcard season tickets sold by National Rail, which include travel within the numbered zones and between the zones and the specified station(s) outside the zone, remain available on paper tickets.

Only Travelcards sold as National Rail tickets are valid for 2-for-1 offers at attractions in London. The exception is one-year Travelcards on an Oyster card which are also valid as they come with a Gold Record Card, but shorter Travelcards on an Oyster card are not.

===Services outside Greater London===

There are various services outside Greater London on which Travelcards can be used. There are some London Underground, London Overground, Elizabeth line and National Rail stations located in the Home Counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Kent which are included in Travelcard zones 4 to 9. A Travelcard covering the appropriate zones are valid for unlimited travel to/from these stations. Additionally, on some London Buses services that cross the Greater London boundary, Travelcards are valid for the whole route.

From outside Travelcard zones, outboundary Travelcards can be bought from some stations to a combination of London Zones, including zone 6, as either a day ticket or season ticket. An outboundary day Travelcard can be used to make one outward journey from the origin station to the boundary of zone 6, then one return journey back to the origin on the same day, with unlimited travel allowed within the zones shown on the ticket. Railway ticket barriers outside zone 6 will often retain the day ticket once the return journey has been made even though the travelcard part of the ticket remains valid until 04:30 the following day within the zone 6 boundary. An outboundary Travelcard season ticket can be used for unlimited travel between the origin and destination, and also the within zones specified on the ticket.

In addition, Travelcards between Zone 1, 2 or 4 and Watford Junction, Zone 1 or 2 and Hertford East / Broxbourne, and Zone 1 or 2 and Shenfield are also available on Oyster cards, with a Travelcard for Hertford East / Broxbourne also including Watford Junction, and a Travelcard for Shenfield also including Watford Junction and Hertford East / Broxbourne as well.

Furthermore, Travelcard ticket holders needing to go outside the covered zones can buy a &quot;Boundary Zone&quot; ticket, used in conjunction with the Travelcard. Such tickets are little known and can only be bought from ticket offices and some ticket machines but not online, as a result, many travellers, not realising that these tickets can be bought, ended up buying other more expensive tickets for their journeys. A class action lawsuit has been filed against the train companies requesting a total of £93 million in compensation; the case has not yet been heard.

===Exceptions===
Although located in Zone 6, travel by Heathrow Express from Heathrow Central, Heathrow Terminal 4 or Heathrow Terminal 5 to London Paddington station is not included. The historical Heathrow Connect service did not accept Travelcards at the airport either; they could be used on the rest of its route between Hayes &amp; Harlington and Paddington, but when this route was replaced by TfL Rail and later the Elizabeth line, this restriction was dropped and Travelcards are now usable there.

Travel on the High Speed 1 rail link between London St Pancras and Stratford International is also not included unless the travelcard is marked &quot;plus high speed&quot; This is because High Speed 1 is considered to be &quot;outside the zones&quot; except for London St Pancras station.

===Revenue allocation===

The revenues from Travelcard sales are divided according to a scheme agreed by Transport for London and the Rail Delivery Group. A quarterly survey known as the Travelcard Diary Survey is undertaken, where travelcard holders are asked to record all the bus, rail and tube trips they have made using their travelcard. Both &quot;in-boundary&quot; and &quot;out-boundary&quot; (i.e. Travelcards in or outside the zonal areas) are surveyed, as well as day and monthly, weekly and annual Travelcards. Ensuring that a statistically valid sample that will give a fair and accurate allocation presents a challenge. The average mileage recorded on each mode is then calculated to give allocation factors of the Travelcard revenue to tube, bus and rail.

===Additional benefits===
Travelcards entitle the holder to a 33% discount on scheduled London River Services and 25% on the London Cable Car. In addition, holders of annual travelcards receive a &quot;gold record card&quot; which offers savings on off-peak travel on the same basis as the National Rail annual gold card.

Travelcards issued on paper tickets at National Rail stations are also treated as &#x27;train tickets&#x27; for the Days Out Guide 2-for-1 offers at most attractions participating in the scheme.

<text>Maynard C. Krueger (January 16, 1906 – December 20, 1991) was an American socialist politician and an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is best remembered as the 1940 vice presidential nominee of the Socialist Party of America.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Maynard Krueger was born January 16, 1906, on a farm near Alexandria, Missouri, in 1906.

A gifted student, Krueger completed his high school work at the age of 15. He entered the University of Missouri, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1926 and a Master&#x27;s degree in 1927.

===Career===

An instructor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1928 to 1932, Krueger also spent time at the universities of Berlin, Paris, and Geneva. His leftist associates in Paris included George Orwell.

In 1932, Krueger accepted a position at the University of Chicago as an assistant professor, initially lecturing in Sociology under Edward Shils. Soon moving to the Economics Department, Krueger became an associate professor in 1947, a full professor in 1965, and emeritus in 1977. He gained a measure of public recognition during the 1930s as a frequent participant in the University of Chicago&#x27;s regular Round Table radio broadcasts.

Krueger was involved with many left-wing organizations such as the Socialist Party of America and the Chicago Workers Committee on Unemployment. During the election campaign of 1932, Krueger served as the national director of research for the Socialist Party. Krueger was also active in the trade union movement, serving three times as a vice president of the American Federation of Teachers during the decade of the 1930s. He was also active in the Chicago Federation of Labor during 1936 and 1937.

During the Socialist Party&#x27;s faction fight of the 1930s, Krueger was an active member of the so-called &quot;Militant&quot; faction of young Marxists who sought to turn the SP to the left. In August 1933, he was a delegate at the Socialist International Congress at Paris, where he advocated arming the proletariat.

In 1940, Krueger was the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate for Vice President of the United States, running with Norman Thomas. Although Krueger was 34 at the time of the November 1940 election, younger than the constitutional age of 35 for someone seeking to be in line for the U.S. presidency, he was able to point out that by Inauguration Day on January 20, 1941, he would be 35 years and 4 days old. In November 1940, the Thomas-Krueger ticket received 116,599 votes (0.2% of the total).

Krueger was on the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party for many years, serving as the SP&#x27;s National Chairman from 1942 to 1946. In 1948, Krueger ran as an Independent candidate for U.S. Representative from Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, receiving 4,566 votes (2.52%).

In 1958, Krueger won the University of Chicago&#x27;s Quantrell Award, believed to be the nation&#x27;s oldest prize for undergraduate teaching.

===Death and legacy===

Krueger died on December 20, 1991. He was 85 years old at the time of his death.

<text>The Milad Tower (, ) (lit. Birth Tower), also known as the Tehran Tower ( ), is a multi-purpose tower in Tehran, Iran. It is the sixth-tallest tower and the world&#x27;s first telecommunication tower in terms of the usage area of the top structure and the tallest tower in Iran and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The construction of this tower took about 11 years and 7 months.

It is located between Shahrak-e Gharb and the district of Gisha, standing at 435 meters from the base to the tip of the antenna. The head consists of a large pod with 12 floors, the roof of which is at 315 meters.

The tower is a part of the International Trade and Convention Center of Tehran, which also includes a five-star hotel, a convention center, a world trade center and an IT park.

==History==
===Background===
The Milad Tower was part of the Shahestan Pahlavi project, a vast development for a new government and commercial centre for Tehran, that was designed in the 1970s but never materialized, except for the tower. After an international competition, the project was awarded to the Llewelyn Davies Company and construction was inaugurated on August 19, 1975, with the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Mayor of Tehran, Gholamreza Nikpey burying a commemorative gold plaque . There is also another background of building this tower, since the construction of the tower was started after the 1979 revolution. The new government of Iran wanted to create a new symbol for Tehran to replace the Azadi Tower that was a symbol of Pahlavi&#x27;s reign.

===Construction===

The construction of the tower was commenced in 1997. In 2001, at the suggestion of the Islamic Council of Tehran, on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it was renamed Milad Tower. The construction of this tower lasted for 11 years.  In the first 8 years, only 40% of the tower was completed, but with the acceleration of the project by Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, the next 60% was built in 30 months. Upon completion of its construction in the mid 2000s, the Milad Tower was considered the fourth-tallest freestanding telecommunication tower in the world. While the tower the construction is finished in 2007, and After 11 years since the beginning of construction, on October 7, 2008, Milad Tower was opened with the slogan &quot;Heaven is near&quot; in the presence of representatives of the Islamic Council, members of the Islamic Council of Tehran and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran.  This ceremony was covered by more than 250 Iranian and foreign journalists. Numerous conflicts on the history of the tower still prevail, partly because sections of the tower were open to visitors once the elevators started operating during construction and the tower was still far from finished.

The design of the project was headed by Iranian architect Mohammad Reza Hafezi. The general contractor was the company of Boland Payeh, and the main client and investor was the company of Yadman Sazeh, a representative of the Municipality of Tehran.

==Structure and features==

Milad Tower is tall and is the tallest tower in Iran, and the sixth-tallest telecommunication tower in the world. It consists of five main parts, including the foundation, transition (lobby) structure, shaft, head structure and the antenna mast.

The lobby structure consists of six floors. The first three floors consist of 63 trade units, 11 food courts, a cafeteria, and a commercial products exhibition which is supposed to be about . The first and second underground floors consist of installing sections and a data center. The ground floor is dedicated to the entrance and the gatehouse.
The shaft is a concrete structure about high from the ground floor. Six elevators in three different sides of the shaft are used to transfer the visitors to the head of the tower at the speed of , besides an emergency staircase at the fourth side.

The head of the tower is a steel structure weighing about 25,000 tonnes and consisting of 12 floors. The top floors of the tower include a public art gallery, a cafeteria, a revolving restaurant, a VIP restaurant, telecommunication floors, mechanical floors, fire-immune areas built as a refuge zone, a closed observation deck, an open observation deck, and a .

The four-stage antenna mast is about high. The lower floor of the mast is for the adjustment of public users&#x27; telecommunication antennas, and the three upper floors are dedicated to the antenna of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.

The complex also features a parking area of about , a large computer and telecommunications unit, a cultural and scientific unit, a commercial transaction center, a temporary showroom for exhibiting products, a specialized library, an exhibition hall, and an administrative unit.

The Milad Tower has an octagonal base, symbolizing traditional Iranian architecture.

<doc id="549016" wikidata="Q1713406" url="?curid=549016" title="Young Germany">
<text>Young Germany () was a group of German writers which existed from about 1830 to 1850. It was essentially a youth ideology, similar to those that had swept France, Ireland, the United States and Italy. Its main proponents were Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg. Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Börne and Georg Büchner were also considered part of the movement. The wider group included Willibald Alexis, Adolf Glassbrenner, Gustav Kühne, Max Waldau and Georg Herwegh. Other figures, such as Ferdinand Freiligrath were also associated with the movement.

==Overview==

The writers of Young Germany were against what they perceived as of &quot;absolutism&quot; in politics and &quot;obscurantism&quot; in religion. They maintained the principles of democracy, socialism, and rationalism. Among the many things they advocated were: separation of church and state, the emancipation of the Jews, and the raising of the political and social position of women. During a time of political unrest in Europe, Young Germany was regarded as dangerous by many politicians due to its progressive viewpoint. During December 1835 the Frankfurt Bundestag banned the publication in Germany of many authors associated with the movement, namely Heine, Gutzkow, Laube, Mundt, and Wienbarg. In their reasoning, they explained that the Young Germans were attempting to “attack the Christian religion in the most impudent way, degrade existing conditions and destroy all discipline and morality with belletristic writings accessible to all classes of readers.”

The ideology produced poets, thinkers and journalists, all of whom reacted against the introspection and particularism of Romanticism in the national literature, which had resulted in a total separation of literature from the actualities of life. The Romantic Movement was considered apolitical, lacking the activism that Germany&#x27;s burgeoning intelligentsia required. As a result of the decades of compulsory school attendance in German states, mass literacy meant an excess of educated males which the establishment could not subsume. Thus in the 1830s, with the advantage of inexpensive printing presses, there was a rush of educated males into the so-called “free professions.”

<text>Welch&#x27;s method, named after Peter D. Welch, is an approach for spectral density estimation. 
It is used in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics for estimating the power of a signal at different frequencies.
The method is based on the concept of using periodogram spectrum estimates, which are the result of converting a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Welch&#x27;s method is an improvement on the standard periodogram spectrum estimating method and on Bartlett&#x27;s method, in that it reduces noise in the estimated power spectra in exchange for reducing the frequency resolution. Due to the noise caused by imperfect and finite data, the noise reduction from Welch&#x27;s method is often desired.

==Definition and procedure==
The Welch method is based on Bartlett&#x27;s method and differs in two ways:
# The signal is split up into overlapping segments: the original data segment is split up into L data segments of length M, overlapping by D points.
## If D = M / 2, the overlap is said to be 50%
## If D = 0, the overlap is said to be 0%. This is the same situation as in the Bartlett&#x27;s method.
# The overlapping segments are then windowed: After the data is split up into overlapping segments, the individual L data segments have a window applied to them (in the time domain).
## Most window functions afford more influence to the data at the center of the set than to data at the edges, which represents a loss of information. To mitigate that loss, the individual data sets are commonly overlapped in time (as in the above step).
## The windowing of the segments is what makes the Welch method a &quot;modified&quot; periodogram.

After doing the above, the periodogram is calculated by computing the discrete Fourier transform, and then computing the squared magnitude of the result, yielding power spectrum estimates for each segment. The individual 
spectrum estimates are then averaged, which reduces the variance of the individual power measurements. The end result is an array of power measurements vs. frequency &quot;bin&quot;.

* Short-time Fourier transform

<doc id="549023" wikidata="Q7775852" url="?curid=549023" title="The Works (film)">
<text>The Works is a shelved animated feature film, partially produced from 1979 to 1986. If it had been finished, it would have been the first film that was entirely 3D computer-animated. It included contributions from individuals who would go on to work at digital animation pioneers Pixar and DreamWorks Animation.

The film was developed by the staff of the Computer Graphics Lab in association with the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, New York. The name was inspired by the original meaning of the word &quot;robot&quot;, derived from &quot;robota&quot; (&quot;work&quot;), a word found in many Slavic languages. It was originally intended to be approximately 90 minutes long although less than 10 minutes are known to have been produced. A trailer for the film was screened at SIGGRAPH in 1982. The project also resulted in other early computer animations such as &quot;3DV&quot;, &quot;Sunstone&quot;, &quot;Inside a Quark&quot; and segments of the short film &quot;The Magic Egg&quot; from 1984.

== Plot ==
The story, written by Lance Williams, was never finalized. It would have centered around &quot;Ipso Facto&quot;, an elliptical robot, and a young female pilot nicknamed &quot;T-Square&quot;. The story would have been set some time in the distant future after a malfunctioning computer, &quot;The Works&quot;, triggered a devastating last World War but then, realizing what it had done, set out to repopulate the planet entirely with robots. T-Square, who works and lives in a nearby asteroid belt, vows to journey to Earth and fight[s] to make it safe to return to for her fellow space-faring humans. 

== Pre-production ==
The founder of NYIT, entrepreneur and academic Dr. Alexander Schure, had a long and ardent interest in animation. He was a great admirer of Walt Disney and was reported to have dreamed of making animated features. He had already created a traditional animation facility at NYIT. After visiting the University of Utah and seeing the potential of computer technology in the form of the drawing program Sketchpad created by Ivan Sutherland, he told his people to pore over the Utah research center and &quot;get him one of everything they had&quot;. He then established the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab, buying state-of-the-art equipment and hiring major researchers from throughout the computer graphics field.

At first, one of CGL&#x27;s main goals was to use computers to produce 2D animation and invent tools to assist traditional animators in their work. Schure reasoned that it should be possible to develop technology that would make the animation process cheaper and faster. An early version of the CAPS system later used by Disney animators was among the tools created.

Upon recognizing its potential, the Lab&#x27;s focus shifted to 3D computer graphics, and when Lance Williams presented his story, &quot;The Works&quot;, the idea was to attempt to make it as a 3D computer-animated feature. This project became the center of attention at NYIT CGL. 

Aside from personal and professional motivation, the practical reason behind the project was to continue to develop patentable tools while demonstrating what computer animation could accomplish for the entertainment industry. The arrival of &quot;The Works&quot; would have been the beginning of a new animation genre. Interested representatives from movie studios and television networks regularly toured the lab as did musicians Laurie Anderson and Peter Gabriel, puppeteer Jim Henson and animation legends Chuck Jones and Shamus Culhane.

Many staff members contributed designs and modeled characters and sets under the coordination of art director Bil Maher who created blueprint-style designs for T-Square and many of the 25 robots called for by the script. Dick Lundin, known for exhaustive and elaborate creations, designed and animated a mining ship and the gigantic robot &quot;Ant&quot;.

Going into the project Schure had been aware of the challenges and potential for success and consistently provided extensive resources to aid the research and development of the necessary technologies. He believed his staff would work best if they were constantly being supplied with the latest computer hardware. However, this meant that his staff would regularly have to upgrade their systems, convert existing programs, and rework familiar tools for use on new machines, delaying production significantly.

== Production difficulties ==
While progress on &quot;The Works&quot; did manage to significantly advance the field of computer animation, the film itself was in development hell for nearly a decade and eventually abandoned for several reasons. The staff was composed almost entirely of technical experts, such as engineers and programmers, with directors and editors considered unnecessary. When NYIT, with Schure as a director, produced a 2D feature known as &quot;Tubby the Tuba&quot;, the film did poorly and lessened their confidence in their ability to produce a film that would succeed critically or financially. The lukewarm reception of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tron&quot;, which used computer graphics heavily, added to the group&#x27;s doubts.

By the time &quot;The Works&quot; was in production, the field of computer graphics had become competitive. George Lucas also recognized the potential of computer animation, and in 1979, created a new department of Lucasfilm which had the same goals as CGL, but ensured that movie industry professionals had a hand in the production. As Lucasfilm began headhunting for the best talent in the industry, many individuals struggling on &quot;The Works&quot; felt that Lucasfilm was a company more likely to succeed and abandoned NYIT. Cornell University was another competitor, and NYIT lost some of its staff to the institution.

The computer systems themselves also became a major problem. While the most powerful hardware at the time, they were too slow and underpowered to generate the number of images required for a theatrical film. Attempting to pick up the pace, the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab kept hiring, having more than 60 employees at its peak. As a way to generate funds, a portion of the team did work-for-hire for advertisers. This, however, meant having to balance production on a feature film, the tools needed and client work. Researcher Ned Greene analyzed all the elements needed to finish the film with devastating results: with the technology available, it would take seven years to output the rendered frames needed.

Once it had been shown that the film could not be realized on available hardware, &quot;The Works&quot; was officially abandoned. A less ambitious project, &quot;3DV&quot;, was attempted. In a bid to circumvent the filmmaking bottleneck, &quot;3DV&quot; was intended to be a TV special with a script that would include footage originally intended for &quot;The Works&quot; repurposed as programming for an imaginary all-computer generated cable TV service. &quot;3DV&quot; incorporated some of its own innovations like 3D lip-synching and compositing a CG character into a live-action scene but, other than a promotional edit which was shown at SIGGRAPH, this too was abandoned.

== Legacy ==
While never finished or released, a significant number of people involved went on to become pioneers in the field of computer graphics. Not only are some techniques developed as part of &quot;The Works&quot;&#x27; production now in common use in 3D modeling and animation programs and in editors like After Effects, Photoshop, and Flash, but staff also moved to other studios and continued their work there. For instance, Edwin Catmull and other CGL team members were hired by Pixar and helped create Toy Story, the first computer-animated feature film, released in 1995.

<doc id="549025" wikidata="Q157505" url="?curid=549025" title="Hepatica">
<text>Hepatica (hepatica, liverleaf, or liverwort) is a genus of herbaceous perennials in the buttercup family, native to central and northern Europe, Asia and eastern North America. Some botanists include &quot;Hepatica&quot; within a wider interpretation of &quot;Anemone&quot;.

==Description==
Bisexual flowers with pink, purple, blue, or white sepals and three green bracts appear singly on hairy stems from late winter to spring. Butterflies, moths, bees, flies and beetles are known pollinators.

The leaves are basal, leathery, and usually three-lobed, remaining over winter.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Hepatica&quot; was described by the English botanist Philip Miller in 1754. It was proposed as a subgenus of &quot;Anemone&quot; in 1836, but later segregated into genus &quot;Hepatica&quot;.

===Taxa===

, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online (POWO) accepts 7 species and one hybrid in the genus &quot;Hepatica&quot;:

One infraspecific taxon is also recognized by POWO:

* &quot;Hepatica nobilis&quot; var. &quot;japonica&quot; 
** Synonym: &quot;Hepatica asiatica&quot; 
** Synonym: &quot;Hepatica insularis&quot; 

&quot;Hepatica&quot; can be divided into two series with respect to leaf edge:

====Series &quot;Triloba&quot;====
The leaves of the series &quot;Triloba&quot; Ulbr. Tamura: are three-lobed with a smooth leaf edge.

* &quot;Hepatica acutiloba&quot;: Eastern Canada, Midwestern United States, Eastern United States
* &quot;Hepatica americana&quot;: Central Canada, Eastern Canada, Midwestern United States, Eastern United States
* &quot;Hepatica maxima&quot;: endemic to Ulleung-do island (South Korea)
* &quot;Hepatica nobilis&quot;:
** &quot;Hepatica nobilis&quot; var. &quot;nobilis&quot;: Europe to Western Siberia
** &quot;Hepatica nobilis&quot; var. &quot;japonica&quot;: Russian Far East, North China, Central China, East China, Korea, and Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, north of Kyushu island)

====Series &quot;Angulosa&quot;====
The leaves of series &quot;Angulosa&quot; (Ulbr.) Tamura are three- to five-lobed with a crenate leaf edge.

* &quot;Hepatica falconeri&quot; — Mountain forests of Central Asia; India: Northwest Himalayas (Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir); Northwest China (Tienshan); Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (Pamir-Alai); North Pakistan, Kazakhstan (North Tienshan)
* &quot;Hepatica henryi&quot;: North Central China, South Central China (western Hubei, northern Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi)
* &quot;Hepatica × media&quot;: Romania
* &quot;Hepatica transsilvanica&quot;: Romania (Carpathian Mountains, Transylvania)

===Etymology===
The word &quot;hepatica&quot; derives from the Greek , from &#x27;liver&#x27;, because its three-lobed leaf was thought to resemble the human liver.

==Distribution==
Plants of genus &quot;Hepatica&quot; are native to Europe, Asia, and North America.

* Europe: Albania, Austria, the Baltic states, Belarus, Bulgaria, Corsica, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, European Russia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, Yugoslavia
* Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Western Siberia
* Eastern Asia: North China, South Central China, East China, Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Primorsky Krai
* South Asia: Pakistan, Western Himalaya
* Canada: Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Québec
* United States: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin

Plants of the genus have been introduced to Belgium.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Hepatica&quot; cultivation has been popular in Japan since the 18th century (mid-Edo period), where flowers with doubled petals and a range of colour patterns have been developed.

Noted for its tolerance of alkaline limestone-derived soils, &quot;Hepatica&quot; may grow in a wide range of conditions; it can be found either in deeply shaded deciduous (especially beech) woodland and scrub or grassland in full sun. &quot;Hepatica&quot; will also grow in both sandy and clay-rich substrates, being associated with limestone. Moist soil and winter snowfall are required; &quot;Hepatica&quot; is tolerant of winter snow cover, but less so of dry frost.

Propagation is done by seeds or by dividing vigorous clumps in spring. However, seedlings take several years to reach bloom size, and divided plants are slow to thicken.

==Uses==
&quot;Hepatica&quot; was once used as a medicinal herb. Owing to the doctrine of signatures, the plant was once thought to be an effective treatment for liver disorders. Although poisonous in large doses, the leaves and flowers may be used as an astringent, as a demulcent for slow-healing injuries, and as a diuretic.

<text>Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database is an in-memory, relational database management system with persistence and high availability. Originally designed and implemented at Hewlett-Packard labs in Palo Alto, California, TimesTen spun out into a separate startup in 1996 and was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2005.

TimesTen databases are persistent and can be highly available. Because it is an in-memory database it provides very low latency and high throughput. It provides standard relational database APIs and interfaces such as the SQL and PL/SQL languages. Applications access TimesTen using standard database APIs such as ODBC and JDBC.

TimesTen can be used as a standalone database, and is also often used as a cache in front of another relational database such as Oracle Database. It is frequently used in very high volume OLTP applications such as prepaid telecom billing and financial trading. It is also used for read-intensive applications such as very large websites and location-based services.

TimesTen can be configured as a shared-nothing clustered system (TimesTen Scaleout) supporting databases much larger than the RAM available on a single machine, and providing scalable throughput and high availability. It can also be configured in replicated active/standby pairs of databases (TimesTen Classic) providing high availability and microsecond response time.

TimesTen runs on Linux, Solaris and AIX and also supports client applications running on Windows and macOS.

==Technology==

TimesTen is an in-memory database that provides very fast data access time. It ensures that all data will reside in physical memory (RAM) during run time. This allows its internal search and data management algorithms used to be simplified, resulting in very low response times even on commodity hardware. TimesTen can make use of available RAM available on its host machine, up to terabytes in size; using TimesTen Scaleout databases much larger than the RAM of a single machine are supported.

=== Database Concepts ===
TimesTen supports standard relational database concepts. Tables consist of rows; rows consist of columns of specific data types. Data is manipulated using SQL. Transactions allow data to be manipulated with appropriate levels of atomicity and isolation; TimesTen supports all standard ACID properties expected of relational databases.

Datatypes supported by TimesTen are in general a subset of those supported by Oracle Database, including NUMBER, VARCHAR and LOBs; TimesTen specific datatypes such as binary integers are also supported.

Applications access TimesTen databases using standard relational APIs such as ODBC, JDBC, OCI, and ODPI-C. This allows applications to be written in many programming languages and environments. Applications use those APIs to access and manipulate data using standard SQL. Stored procedures can also be implemented and executed using PL/SQL.

=== Persistence ===
Though an in-memory database, TimesTen databases are persistent and can be highly available. At runtime all TimesTen data is in RAM, however TimesTen utilizes non-volatile storage for database persistence and recoverability. TimesTen stores snapshots of the database, called checkpoint files, in a local filesystem. In addition all modifications to the database are also recorded in transaction log files. The combination of checkpoint files and transaction log files allow TimesTen to recover the database in the event of a system failure.

In addition TimesTen databases can be replicated to multiple machines to provide for high availability and disaster recovery.

=== Connection Methods ===
Applications may connect to TimesTen databases either in a traditional client/server manner using TCP/IP as the underlying transport or in direct mode. Direct mode allows applications running on the same machine as the database to avoid network stack and context switching overheads. At runtime the data in a TimesTen database is stored in shared memory; this allows application processes to directly attach to the database memory and access it without IPC or context switch overheads. The same APIs and capabilities are available in both modes.

===Caching===

Because TimesTen databases are persistent and can provide high availability, they can be used as the only database in many solutions.

However, TimesTen databases are often used alongside other databases such as Oracle Database, with a TimesTen database serving as a cache for a subset of data in the (perhaps larger) traditional database.

TimesTen provides the capability to cache data from an Oracle Database source. To utilize Oracle Database caching, one defines one or more SQL objects known as &quot;cache groups&quot;. A &quot;cache group&quot; is a set of one or more related database tables and allows for subsets of its rows and/or columns. Database tables in a cache group must each have a defined primary key or a unique index declared across a set of non-nullable columns and must be related in a parent-child hierarchy via primary key-foreign key constraints. SQL predicates can be used to control what data is to be cached.

Once a cache group is defined, the cache group can then be &quot;loaded&quot;, allowing Oracle Database data to be cached in TimesTen. Applications can then read from and write to cache groups, and all data modifications will then be synchronized with the corresponding Oracle Database tables.

Other solutions such as Oracle Golden Gate can also be used to synchronize data between TimesTen and other databases, also allowing TimesTen to be used as a very fast cache in front of other databases.

== Deployment Modes ==
TimesTen can be configured in two ways, called TimesTen Classic and TimesTen Scaleout.

=== TimesTen Classic ===
TimesTen Classic implements in-memory databases that are implemented on a single machine, but which can be replicated to other machines for high availability. Databases provided by TimesTen Classic provide extremely low latency, as queries do not require any network I/O and all data is local.

The TimesTen Classic replication mechanism enables a highly available system by sending database updates between two or more hosts. Typically an active-standby pair of databases is used for highest availability. In addition to the active and standby databases, multiple subscriber databases can be configured to serve as disaster recovery copies or read-only farms.

=== TimesTen Scaleout ===
TimesTen Scaleout allows a single TimesTen database to span many machines. A shared-nothing architecture is used to distribute data across multiple TimesTen instances running on many machines. All machines can query and modify all data in the database, and all database ACID properties are fully supported. Multiple copies of data are kept for high availability. Databases provided by TimesTen Scaleout can be larger than the amount of RAM available on a single machine, and database throughput is scalable as more machines are added.

== Typical Uses ==

* Telecom billing and call processing
* Financial services security trading
* Scalable database services in very large websites
* Location-based services

==History==

TimesTen was founded in HP labs by Marie-Anne Neimat, Sherry Listgarten, Kurt Shoens and Kevin Wilkerson, under the name of &quot;Smallbase&quot;. At HP, Jean-René Bouvier decided to embed Smallbase into HP OpenCall, which made the first commercial use of the product in 1995. In 1996, the product was spun off into a separate venture capital funded startup company based in Mountain View, California under the leadership of CEO Jim Groff. The product became popular for telecommunications equipment, as response times in the milliseconds or even microseconds were required for applications like packet switching. The company had 90 employees and was profitable when it was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2005. After the acquisition, many Oracle database features were added to TimesTen such as support for PL/SQL and integration with Oracle SQL Developer and Oracle Enterprise Manager. TimesTen Scaleout was added in 2018.

<text>The is a commuter rail line in the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto Metropolitan Area owned and operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). The name applies to the section of the Tōkaidō Main Line between Kyōto Station and Ōsaka Station.

The Kyōto Line operates in combination with the Biwako Line and the JR Kobe Line, and offers through service trains to the Kosei Line and the JR Takarazuka Line.

==Basic data==

*Operators, distances: 42.8 km / 26.6 mi.
**West Japan Railway Company (Category-1, services and tracks)
**Japan Freight Railway Company (Category-2, services)
*Track: Entire line quadruple-tracked
*Railway signalling: Automatic
*Maximum speed:
**outer tracks: 130 km/h
**inner tracks: 120 km/h
*CTC centers: Ōsaka Operation Control Center
*CTC system: JR Kyoto-Kobe traffic control system (ja:運行管理システム(JR西日本))

==Services==
Commuter trains are classified in three types:
**Continuing service from the Biwako Line and the Kosei Line. Trains stop at Kyōto, Takatsuki, Shin-Ōsaka, and Ōsaka. Trains continue from Ōsaka on the JR Kōbe Line to Himeji and beyond. 223 series and 225 series EMUs are used. Daytime trains depart every 15 minutes and take 28 minutes from Kyōto to Ōsaka and vice versa.
**Continuing service from the Biwako Line and the Kosei Line. Trains stop at Kyōto, Nagaokakyō, Takatsuki, Ibaraki, Shin-Ōsaka, and Ōsaka. After the morning, trains also stop at all other stations between Kyōto and Takatsuki and occasionally called local trains on this section. Trains continue from Osaka on the JR Kōbe Line to Himeji and beyond. 225 series, 223 series, 221 series EMUs are used.
**Service from Kyōto to Nishi-Akashi on the JR Kōbe Line, and from Takatsuki to Shin-Sanda on the JR Takarazuka Line. Trains stop at all stations. 321 series EMUs and 207 series EMUs are used.

In addition to the three types of commuter trains, long-distance limited express trains connecting the Kyoto-Osaka region with Kansai International Airport (&quot;Haruka&quot; services), Hokuriku region (&quot;Thunderbird&quot; services) and other areas also frequently operate on the line. Freight trains also operate on the line except for the section near Osaka Station where freight trains use separate freight lines.

==Stations==
Legend:

* ● : All trains stop
* | : All trains pass
* ▲ : Trains only after morning rush stop

Local trains stop at all stations. Rapid trains in the morning skip some stops between Kyoto and Takatsuki.

===Closed station===
From September 5, 1876 to the opening of Kyoto Station on February 6, 1877, was the station for the city of Kyoto. The temporary station was located at 40 chains (0.80 km) west of Kyoto Station construction site, or 3 miles and 47 chains (5.77 km) away from Mukōmachi Station.

==History==

The line now called the JR Kyoto Line opened in 1876, only four years after the opening of the first railway in Japan. On 26 July 1876, the Japanese Government Railways opened the section between Ōsaka and Mukōmachi with an intermediate station at Takatsuki. On 9 August 1876, Yamazaki Station, Ibaraki Station and Suita Station opened. Kyoto Station opened on 6 February 1877.

On 1 June 1949, operation of the line was taken over by Japanese National Railways (JNR).
* 1 October 1964 – Shin-Ōsaka Station opens with a Tōkaidō Shinkansen connection
* 1 October 1970 – Operation of Special Rapid Service starts
* 1 April 1987 – JR West becomes the operator of the line following privatization of JNR
* 13 March 1988 – JR West starts the use of the line name JR Kyōto Line

<doc id="549047" wikidata="Q1056332" url="?curid=549047" title="Critique of Judgment">
<text>The Critique of Judgment (), also translated as the Critique of the Power of Judgment, is a 1790 book by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;third critique&quot;, the &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; follows the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781) and the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (1788).

== Context ==

Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; is the third critique in Kant&#x27;s Critical project begun in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (the &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Second Critiques&quot;, respectively). The book is divided into two main sections: the &quot;Critique of Aesthetic Judgment&quot; and the &quot;Critique of Teleological Judgment&quot;, and also includes a large overview of the entirety of Kant&#x27;s Critical system, arranged in its final form. The so-called &quot;First Introduction&quot; was not published during Kant&#x27;s lifetime, for Kant wrote a replacement for publication.

The Critical project, that of exploring the limits and conditions of knowledge, had already produced the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, in which Kant argued for a Transcendental Aesthetic, an approach to the problems of perception in which space and time are argued not to be objects. The First Critique argues that space and time provide ways in which the observing subject&#x27;s mind organizes and structures the sensory world. The end result of this inquiry in the First Critique is that there are certain fundamental antinomies in the dialectical use of Reason, most particularly that there is a complete inability to favor on the one hand the argument that all behavior and thought is determined by external causes, and on the other that there is an actual &quot;spontaneous&quot; causal principle at work in human behavior.

The first position, of causal determinism, is adopted, in Kant&#x27;s view, by empirical scientists of all sorts; moreover, it led to the Idea (perhaps never fully to be realized) of a final science in which all empirical knowledge could be synthesized into a full and complete causal explanation of all events possible to the world.

The second position, of spontaneous causality, is implicitly adopted by all people as they engage in moral behavior; this position is explored more fully in the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;.

The &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; constitutes a discussion of the place of Judgment itself, which must overlap both the Understanding (&quot;Verstand&quot;) (whichsoever operates from within a deterministic framework) and Reason (&quot;Vernunft&quot;) (which operates on the grounds of freedom).

==Introduction to the Critique of Judgement==
The first part of Kant&#x27;s Critique of Aesthetic Judgement presents what Kant calls the four moments of the &quot;Judgement of Taste&quot;. These are given by Kant in sequence as the (1) First Moment. Of the Judgement of Taste: Moment of Quality&quot;; (2) Second Moment. Of the Judgement of Taste: Moment of Quantity&quot;; (3) Third Moment: Of Judgement of Taste: Moment of the Relation of the ends brought under Review in such Judgements&quot;; and (4) Fourth Moment: Of the Judgement of Taste: Moment of the Modality of the Delight in the Object&quot;. After the presentation of the four moments of the Judgement of Taste, Kant then begins his discussion of Book 2 of the Third Critique titled &quot;Analytic of the Sublime&quot;.

==Aesthetic Judgement==

The first part of the book discusses the four possible &quot;aesthetic reflective judgments&quot;: the agreeable, the beautiful, the sublime, and the good. Kant makes it clear that these are the only four possible reflective judgments, as he relates them to the Table of Judgments from the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.

&quot;Reflective judgments&quot; differ from determinative judgments (those of the first two critiques). In reflective judgment we seek to find unknown universals for given particulars; whereas in determinative judgment, we just subsume given particulars under universals that are already known, as Kant puts it:

The agreeable is a purely sensory judgment — judgments in the form of &quot;This steak is good,&quot; or &quot;This chair is soft.&quot; These are purely subjective judgments, based on inclination alone.

The good is essentially a judgment that something is ethical — the judgment that something conforms with moral law, which, in the Kantian sense, is essentially a claim of modality — a coherence with a fixed and absolute notion of reason. It is in many ways the absolute opposite of the agreeable, in that it is a purely objective judgment — things are either moral or they are not, according to Kant.

The remaining two judgments — the beautiful and the sublime — differ from both the agreeable and the good. They are what Kant refers to as &quot;subjective universal&quot; judgments. This apparently oxymoronic term means that, in practice, the judgments are subjective, and are not tied to any absolute and determinate concept. However, the judgment that something is beautiful or sublime is made with the belief that other people ought to agree with this judgment — even though it is known that many will not. The force of this &quot;ought&quot; comes from a reference to a &quot;sensus communis&quot; — a community of taste. Hannah Arendt, in her &quot;Lectures on Kant&#x27;s Political Philosophy&quot;, suggests the possibility that this &quot;sensus communis&quot; might be the basis of a political theory that is markedly different from the one that Kant lays out in the &quot;Metaphysic of Morals&quot;.

The central concept of Kant&#x27;s analysis of the judgment of beauty is what he called the ″free play″ between the cognitive powers of imagination and understanding. We call an object beautiful, because its form fits our cognitive powers and enables such a ″free play″ (§22) the experience of which is pleasurable to us. The judgment that something is beautiful is a claim that it possesses the &quot;form of finality&quot; — that is, that it appears to have been designed with a purpose, even though it does not have any apparent practical function. We also do not need to have a determinate concept for an object in order to find it beautiful (§9). In this regard, Kant further distinguishes between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;adherent&quot; beauty. Whereas judgments of &quot;free beauty&quot; are made without having one determinate concept for the object being judged (e.g. an ornament or well-formed line), a judgment of beauty is &quot;adherent&quot; if we do have such a determined concept in mind (e.g. a well-built horse that is recognized as such). The main difference between these two judgments is that purpose or use of the object plays no role in the case of free beauty. In contrast, adherent judgments of beauty are only possible if the object is not ill-suited for its purpose.

The judgment that something is sublime is a judgment that it is beyond the limits of comprehension — that it is an object of fear. However, Kant makes clear that the object must not actually be threatening — it merely must be recognized as deserving of fear.

Kant&#x27;s view of the beautiful and the sublime is frequently read as an attempt to resolve one of the problems left following his depiction of moral law in the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; — namely that it is impossible to prove that we have free will, and thus impossible to prove that we are bound under moral law. The beautiful and the sublime both seem to refer to some external noumenal order — and thus to the possibility of a noumenal self that possesses free will.

In this section of the critique Kant also establishes a faculty of mind that is in many ways the inverse of judgment — the faculty of genius. Whereas judgment allows one to determine whether something is beautiful or sublime, genius allows one to produce what is beautiful or sublime.

==Teleology==

The second half of the &quot;Critique&quot; discusses teleological judgement. This way of judging things according to their ends (&quot;telos&quot;: Greek for end) is logically connected to the first discussion at least regarding beauty but suggests a kind of (self-) purposiveness (that is, meaningfulness known by one&#x27;s self).

Kant writes about the biological as teleological, claiming that there are things, such as living beings, whose parts exist for the sake of their whole and their whole for the sake of their parts. This allows him to open a gap in the physical world: since these &quot;organic&quot; things cannot be brought under the rules that apply to all other appearances, what are we to do with them?

Kant says explicitly that while efficiently causal explanations are always best (x causes y, y is the effect of x), it is absurd to hope for &quot;another Newton&quot; who could explain a blade of grass without invoking teleology, and so the organic must be explained &quot;as if&quot; it were constituted as teleological. This portion of the Critique is, from some modern theories, where Kant is most radical; he posits man as the ultimate end, that is, that all other forms of nature exist for the purpose of their relation to man, directly or not, and that man is left outside of this due to his faculty of reason. Kant claims that culture becomes the expression of this, that it is the highest teleological end, as it is the only expression of human freedom outside of the laws of nature. Man also garners the place as the highest teleological end due to his capacity for morality, or practical reason, which falls in line with the ethical system that Kant proposes in the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason &quot;and the &quot;Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;.

Kant attempted to legitimize purposive categories in the life sciences, without a theological commitment. He recognized the concept of purpose has epistemological value for finality, while denying its implications about creative intentions at life and the universe&#x27;s source. Kant described natural purposes as organized beings, meaning that the principle of knowledge presupposes living creatures as purposive entities. He called this supposition the finality concept as a regulative use, which satisfies living beings specificity of knowledge. This heuristic framework claims there is a teleology principle at purpose&#x27;s source and it is the mechanical devices of the individual original organism, including its heredity. Such entities appear to be self-organizing in patterns. Kant&#x27;s ideas allowed Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and his followers to formulate the science of types (morphology) and to justify its autonomy.

Kant held that there was no purpose represented in the aesthetic judgement of an object&#x27;s beauty. A pure aesthetic judgement excludes the object&#x27;s purpose.
==Influences==

Though Kant consistently maintains that the human mind is not an &quot;intuitive understanding&quot;—something that creates the phenomena which it cognizes—several of his readers (starting with Fichte, culminating in Schelling) believed that it must be (and often give Kant credit).

Kant&#x27;s discussions of schema and symbol late in the first half of the &quot;Critique of Judgement&quot; also raise questions about the way the mind represents its objects to itself, and so are foundational for an understanding of the development of much late 20th-century continental philosophy: Jacques Derrida is known to have studied the book extensively.

In &quot;Truth and Method&quot; (1960), Hans-Georg Gadamer rejects Kantian aesthetics as ahistorical in his development of a historically-grounded hermeneutics.

==Schopenhauer&#x27;s comments==
Schopenhauer noted that Kant was concerned with the analysis of abstract concepts, rather than with perceived objects. &quot;...he does not start from the beautiful itself, from the direct, beautiful object of perception, but from the &quot;judgement&quot; [someone’s statement] concerning the beautiful...&quot;

Kant was strongly interested, in all of his critiques, with the relation between mental operations and external objects.
&quot;His attention is specially aroused by the circumstance that such a judgement is obviously the expression of something occurring in the subject, but is nevertheless as universally valid as if it concerned a quality of the object. It is this that struck him, not the beautiful itself.&quot;

The book&#x27;s form is the result of concluding that beauty can be explained by examining the concept of &quot;suitableness&quot;. Schopenhauer stated that &quot;[T]hus we have the queer combination of the knowledge of the beautiful with that of the suitableness of natural bodies into &quot;one&quot; faculty of knowledge called &quot;power of judgement&quot;, and the treatment of the two heterogeneous subjects in one book.&quot;

Kant is inconsistent, according to Schopenhauer, because &quot;...after it had been incessantly repeated in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; that the understanding is the ability to judge, and after the forms of its judgements are made the foundation–stone of all philosophy, a quite peculiar power of judgement now appears which is entirely different from that ability.&quot;

With regard to teleological judgement, Schopenhauer claimed that Kant tried to say only this: &quot;...although organized bodies necessarily seem to us as though they were constructed according to a conception of purpose which preceded them, this still does not justify us in assuming it to be objectively the case.&quot; This is in accordance with Kant&#x27;s usual concern with the correspondence between subjectivity (the way that we think) and objectivity (the external world). Our minds want to think that natural bodies were made by a purposeful intelligence, like ours.

<text>Mistel (German, &#x27;mistletoe&#x27;, a parasitic plant) was the larger, unmanned component of a composite aircraft configuration developed in Germany during the later stages of World War II. The composite comprised a small piloted control aircraft mounted above a large explosives-carrying drone, the , and as a whole was referred to as the Huckepack (&#x27;Piggyback&#x27;), also known as the Beethoven-Gerät (&#x27;Beethoven Device&#x27;) or Vati und Sohn (&#x27;Daddy and Son&#x27;).

The most successful of these used a modified Junkers Ju 88 bomber as the &quot;Mistel&quot;, with the entire nose-located crew compartment replaced by a specially designed nose filled with a large load of explosives, formed into a shaped charge. The upper component was a fighter aircraft, joined to the by struts. The combination would be flown to its target by a pilot in the fighter; then the unmanned bomber was released to hit its target and explode, leaving the fighter free to return to base. The first such composite aircraft flew in July 1943 and was promising enough to begin a programme by Luftwaffe test unit KG 200, code-named &quot;Beethoven&quot;, eventually entering operational service.

Other &quot;Mistel&quot; composites included the Ta 154/Fw 190, Ar 234/Fi 103, Do 217K/DFS 228 and Si 204/Lippisch DM-1. Projects included the Ju 287/Me 262 and Ar 234C/Arado E.377.

==Design and development==
Initial experiments in Nazi Germany concerning composite aircraft of any type were performed with the DFS 230 troop glider as the &quot;lower&quot; component and using established, piston engine-powered Luftwaffe aircraft, such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 56 or the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, as the upper component in an attempt to provide the troop glider with a longer range than if it were simply towed in the conventional manner.

Later, the technique became more refined, and the bomber component (which was often a new aircraft rather than surplus) was fitted with a specialised 1,800 kg (3,960 lb.) warhead. The final stage of &quot;Mistel&quot; development was of specialised purpose-built jet-powered bomber components, including ones developed from the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Junkers Ju 287 and the entirely new Arado Ar 234. None of these ambitious schemes, with the exception of the Me 262 , had left the drawing board before the end of the war.

===Warhead and operational history===
The definitive warhead was a shaped charge weighing nearly two tonnes (the weight of a blockbuster bomb) fitted with a copper or aluminium liner. The use of a shaped charge was expected to allow penetration of up to seven meters of reinforced concrete.

Some 250 of various combinations were built during the war, but they met with limited success. They were first flown in combat against the Allied invasion fleet during the Battle of Normandy, targeting the British-held harbour at Courseulles-sur-Mer. An RCAF Mosquito piloted by Walter Dinsdale was first to shoot down a over Normandy, causing it to crash behind enemy lines and cause a large explosion. The night-fighter ace described the Bf 109 and Ju 88 composite as &quot;lumbering&quot; and a &quot;cinch to shoot down&quot;.

While &quot;Mistel&quot; pilots claimed hits, none of these match Allied records; they may have been made against the hulk of the old French battleship &quot;Courbet&quot;, which had been included as a component of the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches and specially dressed up as a decoy by the Allies. Serious blast and shrapnel damage from a near-miss was suffered by HMS &quot;Nith&quot;, a River-class frigate being used as a floating headquarters, on 24 June. Nine men were killed and 26 wounded, and &quot;Nith&quot; was towed back to England for repairs.

A second opportunity to use the , in Scapa Flow in 1944, was abandoned after the sinking of the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; led to the departure of all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s major surface units from the target.

As part of Operation Iron Hammer in late 1943 and early 1944, were selected to carry out key raids against Soviet weapons-manufacturing facilities—specifically, electricity-generating power stations around Moscow and Gorky. These plants were known to be poorly defended by the Soviets and irreplaceable. However, before the plan could be implemented, the Red Army had entered Germany, and it was decided to use the against their bridgehead at Küstrin instead. On 12 April 1945, attacked the bridges being built there, but the damage caused was negligible and delayed the Soviet forces for only a day or two. Subsequent &quot;Mistel&quot; attacks on other bridges being thrown across the Oder were similarly ineffective.

==Survivors==
A Focke-Wulf Fw 190 (&quot;Werk Nr.&quot; 733682), preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford, was the fighter part of a &quot;Mistel&quot; system. It was one of four that were captured by British forces at Tirstrup in Denmark in 1945. In service, it had been flown by a unit that trained &quot;Mistel&quot; crews. After capture, the aircraft were flown as a combined pair in Allied hands as they were ferried to Schleswig Air Base, along with two other captured &quot;Mistels&quot;, The Fw 190 was later flown to Britain while its Ju 88 partner is thought to have been scrapped.

The Fw 190 retains its &quot;Kugelverschraubung mit Sprengbolzen&quot; (&quot;ball joints with explosive bolts&quot;), fittings that attached it to the other aircraft.

The aircraft became the property of the RAF Museum in 1998 when its title was transferred from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence. It was put on display at the RAF Museum Cosford in 2013 after previously being on long-term loan to the Imperial War Museum.

<text>The Kuala Lumpur Tower (; Jawi: ), colloquially referred to as KL Tower, is a 6-storey, telecommunication tower in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is the world&#x27;s seventh-tallest tower. It features an antenna which increases its height to . The roof of the pod is at . The rest of the tower below has a stairwell and an elevator to reach the upper area, which also contains a revolving restaurant, providing diners with a panoramic view of the city.

Races are held annually, where participants race up the stairs to the top. The tower also acts as the Islamic falak observatory to observe the crescent moon which marks the beginning of Muslim month of Ramadhan, Syawal, and Zulhijjah, to celebrate fasting month of Ramadhan, Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Aidiladha. The tower is the highest viewpoint in Kuala Lumpur that is open to the public.

== History ==
The official groundbreaking for the Kuala Lumpur Tower was overseen by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on 1 October 1991. Construction of the tower was a three-phase process.

The first phase was the widening of Jalan Bukit Nanas and the excavation of soil from the construction site. This phase was completed on 1 August 1992.

On 1 July 1992, the second phase began with the construction of the foundation and basement of the tower. Approximately 50,000 cubic metres of concrete were continuously poured for 31 hours, thus setting a record in the Malaysian construction industry. The foundation work, requiring no piling, was completed on 1 April 1993.

The third phase was the construction of the &#x27;superstructure&#x27; which began in May 1994. The construction of the tower started with the erection of the tower shaft, then the tower head. As the finishing touches to the tower head were applied, the construction of the touristic building began.

The main lobby of the upper ground floor is decorated with exquisite glass-clad domes that sparkle like giant diamonds. These domes were designed and arranged in the form of the Muqarnas by Iranian craftsmen from Isfahan.

On 13 September 1994, Mahathir performed the &#x27;topping-out ceremony&#x27; where the antenna mast was installed, thus marking the final height of the tower, 421 metres above the ground. After installation of facilities and amenities, Menara Kuala Lumpur was opened to public on 23 July 1996, and it was the tallest structure in Malaysia at the time of its completion, and 3 years later, it was surpassed by Petronas Twin Towers as the tallest structure in the country.

Menara Kuala Lumpur was officially inaugurated by Mahathir on 1 October 1996 at 20:30 MST. Among the distinguished guests were the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Raja Permaisuri Agong Tuanku Najihah, the wives of the Sultan of Brunei, Queen Saleha and Princess Hajah Mariam Binti Abdul Aziz.

== Ownership and management ==
The Kuala Lumpur Tower itself is owned by the Government of Malaysia, but since its opening in 1996, it has been operated and maintained under a concession to Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of the state-controlled telecommunications company, Telekom Malaysia. The contract for this was last renewed for a 10-year period in 2011. In 2019, Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn Bhd reported a net profit of RM20.9 million on revenue of RM65.6 million.

In December 2022, it was reported that the concession had been transferred for RM3.9 million to privately owned Hydroshoppe Sdn Bhd, on 31 October 2022. Little is known about Hydroshoppe&#x27;s ownership, but it is believed to be a shell company, with paid-up capital of only RM1 million, and its two publicly declared directors being secretaries from business consultants Azam Corporate Services.

Telekom Malaysia said in a statement that they decided not to renew the concession in October 2021, &quot;due to the change in the business nature of [Menara Kuala Lumpur], from telecommunications to hospitality&quot;. They added that &quot;the selection process of the new concessionaire was [then] taken up by the Government&quot; (then controlled by a Barisan Nasional-Perikatan Nasional coalition, headed by Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob). They stated that all current employees would also retain their jobs for three years following the transition.

According to Minister of Communications and Digital, Fahmi Fadzil, Telekom Malaysia is still operating the concession for the tower as of 31 December 2022, under a &quot;third interim period&quot;. He has requested an internal briefing from both Telekom Malaysia and the Ministry of Communications and Digital. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has also announced an investigation into potential &quot;elements of corruption&quot; regarding this case, with three witnesses called as of 31 December.

== Broadcasting ==
Kuala Lumpur Tower, a member of the World Federation of Great Towers, is utilised by several organisations for various broadcasting purposes. Originally intended only for television broadcasting, radio antennas were included during the construction. The tower now broadcasts free-to-air terrestrial television stations that use the tower&#x27;s antenna include:

*Television:
** Radio Televisyen Malaysia
*** TV1 (VHF Channel 5)
*** TV2 (VHF Channel 8)
** Media Prima Berhad
*** NTV7 (UHF Channel 35)
** Alhijrah Media Corporation
*** TV Alhijrah (UHF Channel 55)
*Radio:
** Radio Televisyen Malaysia

*** TraXX FM (90.3 MHz)
*** Asyik FM (91.1 MHz)
*** Minnal FM (92.3 MHz)
*** KL FM (97.2 MHz)

Media telecommunications and broadcasting mast. Television stations which are transmitted from the tower includes private (commercial) station, NTV7 a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad broadcasting through UHF obtained from an antenna by 200 metres.

Malaysia currently employs both analogue broadcasting and all television broadcasting is to be analogue. Kuala Lumpur Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not tall enough to transmit the higher frequency waves needed to areas surrounded by forests or high-rise buildings. As an alternative, a new . To make Kuala Lumpur Tower more appealing to one free-to-air terrestrial commercial broadcasting on Media Prima Berhad who plan to move their transmitting stations to the new tower have drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 401 to 421 metres. To increase the height of the tower&#x27;s antenna by 421 metres, the structure itself will have to be lengthened by 200 metres, which would cost approximately RM4 billion. In addition to covering this cost, the company would put RM3.5 billion into refurbishing the transmitting station, offering four times more area to each broadcaster. Current Kuala Lumpur aviation restrictions limit Kuala Lumpur Tower&#x27;s height, but has stated that the company plans to discuss the matter with related ministries and agencies. If these plans are not realised, however, Kuala Lumpur Tower is expected to stop transmitting television waves with the exception of Media Prima Berhad, who will continue to broadcast through the tower. also pointed out the possibility of the tower depending on what the television broadcasters want or need.

== Facts ==

The KL Tower is the seventh tallest telecommunication tower in the world (after Tokyo Skytree in Japan, the Canton Tower in China, CN Tower in Canada, the Ostankino Tower in Russia, the Oriental Pearl Tower in China, and the Milad Tower in Iran). Built to enhance the quality of telecommunication services and the clarity of broadcasting, KL Tower is a symbol of Kuala Lumpur.

The structure is divided into five basic sections:
# The foundation base houses three basement floors for safety purposes, storage and maintenance work.
# The touristic building bears the administration office, souvenir shops and the pedestrian mall with cascading pools.
# The tower shaft comprises 22 levels with four elevators and flights of stairs with a total of 2,058 steps.
# The tower has an estimated volume of 
# The tower head holds the public observation platform (276 m) and revolving restaurant, as well as the telecommunication and broadcasting stations.
# The antenna mast crowns the tower and is utilised for telecommunication and broadcasting transmissions.

When constructing the KL Tower, the builders took special care to construct a retaining wall around a 100-year-old jelutong tree (&quot;Dyera costulata&quot;). The tower was moved at a cost of RM430,000 to avoid harming the monumental tree, which is found near the pedestrian mall.

KL Tower is managed by Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn. Bhd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Telekom Malaysia Group.

KL Tower was the first Pit Stop in &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 1&quot; and fielded a route marker on the final leg of the same season.

==Transport==
The Tower is located on Jalan Puncak, which branches off from Jalan P. Ramlee. Even though they&#x27;re not very close, the closest rapid transit stations would be Bukit Nanas station and Dang Wangi LRT station. The tower also has outdoor parking for cars and bus (KL tower parking rate).

==Tourism==
Tourists visit KL Tower to have a 360-degree view of the city. The lift takes only 54 seconds going up to the observation deck and takes 52 seconds to come down.

<text>The Cowsills are an American singing group from Newport, Rhode Island, six siblings noted for performing professionally and singing harmonies at an early age, later with their mother.

The band was formed in early 1965 by brothers Bill, Bob, and Barry Cowsill; their brother John joined shortly thereafter. Originally Bill and Bob played guitar and Barry played the drums. When John learned to play drums and joined the band, Barry began playing bass. After their initial success, the brothers were joined by their siblings Susan and Paul along with their mother, Barbara. A seventh sibling, Bob&#x27;s fraternal twin brother Richard, was never part of the band during its heyday, although he occasionally appeared with them in later years.

The band&#x27;s road manager for most of their career was Richard &quot;Biggie&quot; Korn. When the group expanded to its full family membership by 1967, the six siblings ranged in age from 8 to 19. Joined by their mother, Barbara Cowsill (née Russell), the group inspired the 1970s television show &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;.

==Origins and early successes==

The Cowsills&#x27; musical interest started while their father, William &quot;Bud&quot; Cowsill, was stationed in Canton, Ohio, in the late 1950s, as a US Navy recruiter. Bill and Bob taught themselves how to play the guitar. As the boys&#x27; musical and vocal abilities developed they began performing at church school dances in Stark County, Ohio. These, and other performances, led to the boys&#x27; first television appearance on the &quot;Gene Carroll Show&quot; on WEWS in Cleveland.

After Bud retired from the Navy, he and his wife managed their children&#x27;s career until 1967.

In late 1965, the Cowsills were hired as a regular act on Bannisters Wharf in Newport. The group performed many of the popular songs of the day including the music of the Beatles. A handful of singles were released on JODA Records, a label owned by Danny Sims and Johnny Nash (of &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; fame), and Philips Records in 1965 and 1966, to only modest success. After Leonard Stogel took over management of the band, they were signed to MGM Records in 1967. Barbara, who would become known to their fans affectionately as &quot;Mini-Mom&quot; due to her diminutive stature, joined the group just in time to record the band&#x27;s first album, including the hit single &quot;The Rain, The Park &amp; Other Things&quot; with Bill on lead vocals. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold record. With the success of &quot;The Rain ...&quot;, the band quickly became a popular act in the U.S., and achieved significant airplay in Britain and other parts of Europe. &quot;The Rain, The Park and Other Things&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Bob Cowsill is quoted as follows on the band&#x27;s early days:
Although Bill and I performed at a very young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a guy from the &quot;Today Show&quot; saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the &quot;Today&quot; show. We weren&#x27;t famous or anything but we were young and we were related and we were quite good. So we went on &quot;The Today Show&quot; (I doubt a tape exists of that but if it did it would be priceless to see) and someone from Mercury Records saw us, which ultimately led to our signing with that label and putting out &quot;Most Of All&quot; (a great &quot;school&#x27;s out&quot; song that should have been our first hit in my opinion), which led to Artie Kornfeld and Steve Duboff. Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written &quot;The Rain, The Park and Other Things&quot; and we went in and recorded that song at A&amp;R studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn&#x27;t it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.
The Cowsills released five albums in all for MGM records between 1967 and 1970. Following the success of &quot;Rain&quot; and their eponymous album, the title track from their second album, &quot;We Can Fly&quot;, peaked at #21 in the spring of 1968; by that time Susan was added to the group. Later that same year they scored another Top 10 hit with the song &quot;Indian Lake&quot;, produced by Wes Farrell, which reached No.10 on the US charts. &quot;Captain Sad and his Ship of Fools&quot;, the album it appeared on, was produced by Bill and Bob and had added Paul to the group.

In September 1968, after the group&#x27;s summer tour, the family relocated to Santa Monica, California. Shortly after arriving, they received a copy of the &quot;Hair&quot; soundtrack album in the mail from the famed writer-producer-actor Carl Reiner, who was putting together a special for television called &quot;Wonderful World of Pizzazz&quot;. The special was to be a celebration of the hippie fashion and music of that time. Reiner wanted the group to appear on the show performing &quot;Hair&quot;, the title track from the current hit musical, and indicated that their performance would also have a satirical edge thanks to the juxtaposition of the squeaky-clean family group performing a song about long-haired hippies. At that time, the group had not heard of the musical and considered the request from Reiner as more of an assignment.

Following rehearsals at their home, and demo sessions at SIR Studios on Santa Monica Boulevard, The Cowsills&#x27; version of &quot;Hair&quot; was recorded over two days in early October 1968 at TTG Studios in Hollywood, where the TV company producing the special were regular clients. A key attraction of TTG was its custom-built 16-track recorder, the only such machine available in Los Angeles at the time, which attracted leading rock acts like Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Working with house engineer Angel Balestier, the track was arranged and produced by Bob and Bill, who made sure that each member of the group got to contribute an individual vocal part to the recording, both in lead and background vocals, ensuring that each of the group&#x27;s members would feature on screen when they performed it for the TV special.

Interviewed in 2018, Bob Cowsill recalled the intensive recording process, which was complicated by the fact that the group had not been in a recording studio for several months. The basic rhythm track was laid down first by Bill, Bob, John and Barry, but John (who was only 12 at the time) had difficulty mastering the time changes in the song, especially during the bridge (&quot;Oh say can you see&quot;) section, and it reportedly required over 100 takes to achieve a satisfactory version. The group then proceeded to record the elaborate backing and lead vocal tracks, which were intricately arranged and engineered. The backing vocals were all double-tracked, and Balestier added additional &quot;sparkle&quot; to each vocal pass by sending the signal from the vocal microphone first through a Leslie speaker, then to the TTG echo chamber. The clean vocal signal, the &quot;Leslie-ed&quot; vocal signal and the Leslie-plus-echo signal were then all separately fed back to the console and mixed onto one track of the master. Each section of backing vocal was then double-tracked onto a second track, using the same setup of Leslie and echo, creating a very dense and lush sound. Another notable feature of the arrangement was dictated by the purpose of the recording - the network was concerned that some lyrics in the song might be problematic for viewers in the more socially conservative areas of the United States, so the group omitted the original final verse (which mentions God, Jesus and the Bible) and replaced it with a repeat of the first verse.

Balestier mixed the mono track for the group to use during the filming of the special at the end of the final day of recording, but MGM records had no interest in releasing the song at that time. Bill had an acetate of the song cut at DCT Recorders which ended up being played for a DJ at WLS (AM) in Chicago where it generated significant attention. The TV special was taped on January 5, 1969, in San Francisco. As the air date of March 18 approached, MGM changed their minds and released the single. The band had a No.2 US hit and million seller with this version of the title song from the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. A stereo mix of this elaborate studio version of &quot;Hair&quot; subsequently became the opening track for &quot;The Cowsills in Concert&quot; album, which was released in May 1969. The remainder of &quot;The Cowsills in Concert&quot; (which ended up being the band&#x27;s best selling album) was in fact actually recorded live.

From 1968 through 1972, the band played an average of 200 performance dates per year. They had their own comic book published by Harvey Comics in 1968.

==Breakup and reunions==

According to the documentary, &quot;Family Band: The Cowsills Story&quot;, Bill was fired by his father during the group&#x27;s tenure at the Flamingo Las Vegas in February 1970 after they had an argument over Bill&#x27;s association with Waddy Wachtel (whom Bud did not approve of) which ended with a physical confrontation, with Bud being arrested for assault. The band continued without Bill, and Bob took over as the leader. The album &quot;II x II&quot; was released just a few weeks after&#x27;s Bill&#x27;s departure. Musically, it heavily featured Bill since he&#x27;d been present for the recording sessions, but aside from a couple of songwriting credits, his name does not appear on the album. The title track was written solely by Bill, but it was credited to his pseudonym, David W. Ray. &quot;II x II&quot; spawned three singles, two of which were minor hits, but the album as a whole failed to get into the Billboard 200.

The group parted ways with MGM in 1970, and &quot;On My Side&quot;, their next release (and their first without Bill), was released on London Records in February 1971. This album did get into the Billboard 200, but just barely: it peaked at #200. Bill came back later in 1971, and the band subsequently released two non-album singles, neither of which were hits.

In 1971, the non-musical Cowsill, Richard received an Undesirable Discharge from the Army for drug use and other misconduct. He struggled with addiction and other issues for many years, and was arrested several times.

By 1972, Barbara, Paul and Susan had left the group. A lucrative deal for some casino appearances was abruptly canceled after the group refused to perform their hits. Shortly afterward, The Cowsills stopped playing together as a band altogether. The individual members went on to various career attempts in and out of the music industry, but they did appear at Madison Jr. High School in Tampa, Florida as &quot;The Cowsills&quot; for one performance during the mid-1970s. Some produced albums and performed from time to time, albeit not as The Cowsills, during the remainder of the 1970s. One project in particular was a band called Bridey Murphy, which was formed in the mid-&#x27;70s and featured Paul, Bill, Barry, and Waddy Wachtel, and performed to varying degrees of success.

In 1978 several of the Cowsills—including Paul, John, Barry, Bob and Susan—recorded an album called &quot;Cocaine Drain&quot; with producer Chuck Plotkin. In October 1978, they played a show at Blackie&#x27;s Bar in Los Angeles which was favorably reviewed by &quot;Billboard&quot; in the weekly &quot;Talent in Action&quot; column. The 37-minute show opened with &quot;a sultry rocker&quot; titled &quot;Cocaine Drain.&quot; The band had reportedly signed with Columbia Records and &quot;were setting the stage for a nearly completed album.&quot;
In March 2008 a version of the album was finally released, remastered from an acetate under Bob Cowsill&#x27;s direction. Several other previously unreleased tracks were included on the 2008 release.

The central four members of the group created the power pop tune &quot;Is It Any Wonder?&quot; in 1993, which was released in the critically praised multi-artist collection &quot;Yellow Pills, Vol. 1: The Best of American Pop&quot;.

In the years following the group&#x27;s split, Susan continued her musical career as a member of The Continental Drifters, along with both her first husband Peter Holsapple and her second husband, Russ Broussard. She was a member of Dwight Twilley&#x27;s band in the mid-1980s, and currently leads her own band, the Susan Cowsill Band. Her first solo album, &quot;Just Believe it&quot;, was released in late 2005 by Blue Corn Music. In 2011 she was featured in an episode of the HBO series, &quot;Tremé&quot;.

John Cowsill has also continued his performing career. From December 2000 until 2023, John was a regular member of The Beach Boys’ touring band, playing keyboards (until 2007) and drums (after 2007). He also contributed to the harmony stack, as well as occasionally singing lead on songs like “Wild Honey” and &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;. John was also part of the backing band for The Beach Boys’ 50th Anniversary Reunion tour during 2012 and performed on the reunion album recorded in 2011 and 2012. In earlier years, he performed with artists such as Jan &amp; Dean and Dwight Twilley.

Bill Cowsill moved to Canada in the 1970s and did well in that country as a solo artist, and as a member of Vancouver, British Columbia&#x27;s Blue Northern, before forming The Blue Shadows, who recorded two albums for Sony Canada.

After working as a sound engineer for Helen Reddy, Paul Cowsill left music for a career in the construction industry. He worked as a landscaper on several movies and television shows including the &quot;Twilight&quot; series and &quot;Grimm&quot;.

In October 1989 Bob, Paul, John and Susan again regrouped as The Cowsills playing club dates in Los Angeles and appeared in concert for the syndicated radio show, &quot;The Lost 45s with Barry Scott&quot; on July 1, 1990. The original plan was to simply hit the &quot;oldies circuit&quot;, but after some deliberation, they decided to showcase new material written by Bob and his wife, Mary Jo. This incarnation of the band started playing small clubs and showcases in the Los Angeles area and eventually spread out to similar venues across the country and into Canada. Their performances generated positive reviews from critics and fans alike, including a very well received performance on &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;.

The success of this reunion led The Cowsills back into the recording studio, which resulted in the album &quot;Global&quot; in 1998. This has also led to several reunions over the years in various forms, ranging from a few concerts to special feature performances at major events. Most notable of these events were &quot;A Taste of Rhode Island in 2000&quot;, which featured all seven surviving Cowsills, and &quot;A Family Thing 2&quot;, which was a benefit concert in 2004 for Bill&#x27;s medical and financial difficulties at the time. This concert took place at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles and included an appearance by Shirley Jones, who introduced the band. It was the first time they had ever met. As the mother on the TV show inspired by the Cowsills, Shirley made a point of calling them &quot;the real thing&quot;. Though she did not sing with them that night, immediately after her announcement the Cowsills played &quot;I Really Want to Know You&quot;; it is the one song recorded by both The Cowsills and The Partridge Family. During this period, Barry also released a solo CD, &quot;As Is&quot;.

In October 2004 Bob, Paul, Barry, Susan and Richard reunited to sing the national anthem at Fenway Park before Game 4 of the 2004 American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. The Red Sox were on the verge of elimination, but they won this game and the next three games to defeat the Yankees, 4 games to 3. This performance and rehearsals for it can be seen in the 2011 documentary, &quot;Family Band: The Cowsills Story&quot;. 

Susan&#x27;s first solo release, &quot;Just Believe It&quot;, was released in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the United States.
Susan Cowsill continues to play live in New Orleans with her husband Russ Broussard and their band, playing &quot;Covered In Vinyl&quot; performances that have featured classic rock albums played live in their entirety. Some of these performances have been recorded at New Orleans venues like Carrollton Station and Chickie Wah Wah.

Susan Cowsill&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Lighthouse&quot; was released in 2010 with support from the New Orleans musicians&#x27; organization Threadheads. It is a concept album in which she reflects on her losses, mainly through Hurricane Katrina and the deaths of brothers Barry and Bill. The album features harmonies from her surviving brothers (Bob, Paul and John) as well as appearances by Jackson Browne and Vicki Peterson, and was released May 18, 2010.

The Cowsills were inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame on Sunday April 28, 2013.

The Cowsills released &quot;Rhythm of the World&quot;, their first studio album of new material since 1998, on September 30, 2022.

As of 2024, the group consisting of Bob, Paul and Susan, and occasionally John, still perform and since 2015 have appeared on the annual &quot;Happy Together&quot; package tour with the Turtles and several other sixties era bands.

==Television appearances==
The Cowsills made many television appearances throughout the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. Their appearances included:
* &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (twice, see below)
* &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (twice)
* &quot;American Bandstand&quot;
* &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;
* &quot;The Barbara McNair Show&quot;
* &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot;
* &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;
* &quot;Music Scene&quot;
* &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;
* &quot;Wonderful World of Pizzazz&quot;

The Cowsills made their first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on October 29, 1967. Although contracted for ten appearances, their second and final appearance was on December 24, 1967, after Bud confronted the Sullivan production team over a technical glitch during the performance.

Game show appearances included &quot;The Generation Gap&quot; with Barbara and Bob, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in which the panel had to identify the real Barbara Cowsill, which was #2; she received two votes while one of the two &quot;imposters&quot; also received two votes. During game play, the siblings stood behind the three contestants.

They starred in their own television special, called &quot;A Family Thing&quot;, in November 1968 on NBC, which guest-starred Buddy Ebsen. By 1969 Screen Gems approached the family to portray themselves in their own TV sitcom, but when they were told that their mother was to be replaced by actress Shirley Jones the deal fell through. Screen Gems later hired Jones&#x27; stepson David Cassidy to join the TV show &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, and to have a four-year run on ABC Television.

The Cowsills were also known as spokespeople for the American Dairy Association, appearing in advertisements promoting milk. They performed the theme for the David Niven film &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; (1968), and also sang the theme for &quot;Love American Style&quot; during the first season (1969).

On August 10, 2010, the documentary film, &quot;Family Band: The Cowsills Story&quot; debuted at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. On March 6, 2013, the film made its network television debut on Showtime. The film, directed by Louise Palanker and co-directed / edited by Bill Filipiak, tells the behind the scenes story of the family, their rise to fame and subsequent fall due to their father&#x27;s controlling and abusive nature. The film features interviews with Tommy James, Shirley Jones, and radio personality Cousin Brucie.

In 2019, Bob, Paul, and Susan Cowsill were interviewed by journalist Rod Labbe for &quot;RetroFan&quot; magazine, in which they discussed their careers and lives together and apart.

<text>The United States National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), previously known as the National Weather Records Center (NWRC), in Asheville, North Carolina, was the world&#x27;s largest active archive of weather data.

In 2015, the NCDC merged with two other federal environmental records agencies to become the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
==History==
In 1934, the U.S. government established a tabulation unit in New Orleans, Louisiana, to process weather records. Climate records and upper air observations were punched onto cards in 1936. This organization was transferred to Asheville, North Carolina, in 1951, where the National Weather Records Center (NWRC). It was housed in the Grove Arcade Building in Asheville, North Carolina.

Processing of the climate data was accomplished at Weather Records Processing Centers at Chattanooga, Tennessee; Kansas City, Missouri; and San Francisco, California, until January 1, 1963, when it was consolidated with the NWRC.

In 1967, the agency was renamed the National Climatic Data Center.

In 1995, the NCDC moved into the newly completed Veach-Baley Federal Complex in downtown Asheville.

In 2015, the NCDC merged with the National Geophysical Data Center and the National Oceanographic Data Center to become the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

==Sources==
Data were received from a wide variety of sources, including weather satellites, radar, automated airport weather stations, National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observers, aircraft, ships, radiosondes, wind profilers, rocketsondes, solar radiation networks, and NWS Forecast/Warnings/Analyses Products.

==Climate focus==
The Center provided historical perspectives on climate which were vital to studies on global climate change, the greenhouse effect, and other environmental issues. The Center stored information essential to industry, agriculture, science, hydrology, transportation, recreation, and engineering. These services are still provided by the NCEI.

The NCDC said:

Evidence is mounting that global climate is changing. While it is generally accepted that humans are negatively influencing the climate, the extent to which humans are responsible is still under study. Regardless of the causes, it is essential that a baseline of long-term climate data be compiled; therefore, global data must be acquired, quality controlled, and archived. Working with international institutions such as the International Council of Scientific Unions, the World Data Centers, and the World Meteorological Organization, NCDC develops standards by which data can be exchanged and made accessible.NCDC provides the historical perspective on climate. Through the use of over a hundred years of weather observations, reference data bases are generated. From this knowledge the clientele of NCDC can learn from the past to prepare for a better tomorrow. Wise use of our most valuable natural resource, climate, is the goal of climate researchers, state and regional climate centers, business, and commerce.
==Associated entities==
NCDC also maintained World Data Center for Meteorology, Asheville. The four World Centers (U.S., Russia, Japan and China) have created a free and open situation in which data and dialogue are exchanged.

NCDC maintained the U.S. Climate Reference Network datasets and a vast number of other climate monitoring products.

<doc id="549085" wikidata="Q5304775" url="?curid=549085" title="Vietnam War draft">
<text>The Vietnam War draft were two lotteries conducted by the Selective Service System of the United States on December 1, 1969, to determine the order of conscription to military service in the Vietnam War in 1970. It was the first time a lottery system had been used to select men for military service in the US since 1942, and established the priority of call based on the birth dates of registrants born between January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950.

==Origins==
The lottery of 1969 was devised to increase the numbers of military personnel available for service in the Vietnam War, while addressing inequities in the previous draft system. US involvement in Vietnam began in 1946 with support for France during the French Indo-China war. The Geneva Accords of July 1954 brought an end to the conflict, with a new border drawn along the 17th parallel separating the Communist North and the French-controlled South. South Vietnam subsequently gained independence from France and Ngô Đình Diệm became prime minister. U.S. interest in Vietnam increased through the early 1960s, with the U.S. sending military advisors to Vietnam in 1961 and supporting the 1963 Diem Coup and the resulting execution of Ngô Đình Diệm. On August 2, 1964, a U.S. Navy destroyer was attacked by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. A similar attack on two U.S. destroyers was reported on the night of August 4, but that report was incorrect. Both incidents were used to justify the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, granting President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to allocate U.S. military resources to the conflict in Vietnam. Johnson deployed 190,000 military personnel to Vietnam in 1965 and approximately 400,000 the following year. These deployments increased the demand for US military personnel, and led ultimately to the first Vietnam draft.

Anti-war movements emerged in the U.S. throughout the 1960s, many amongst college students and civil rights groups. By the end of the decade, the anti-war movement included many veterans who had served in Vietnam as well as middle-class parents with draft-age sons. College students were entitled to a deferment (2-S status) but were subject to the draft if they dropped out, stopped making &quot;normal progress&quot; in community college (i.e., started a fifth semester before transferring to a four-year college) or graduated. By 1967, the number of U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was around 500,000. The war was costing the U.S. $25 billion a year, and many of the young men drafted were being sent to fight in a war which they opposed. Martin Luther King Jr. also started to support the anti-war movement, believing the war to be immoral and expressing alarm at the number of African-American soldiers that were being killed.

November 15, 1969, was marked by the largest anti-war protest in the history of the United States, featuring many anti-war political speakers and popular singers of the time. Many critics at the time saw President Richard Nixon as a liar: on taking office Nixon pledged to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Vietnam, but after ten months no withdrawals had taken place. Later, Nixon claimed to have been watching sports as the anti-war demonstration took place outside the White House.

After much debate within the Nixon administration and Congress, the latter decided that a gradual transition to an all-volunteer force was affordable, feasible, and would enhance the nation&#x27;s security. On November 26, 1969, Congress abolished a provision in the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 which prevented the president from modifying the selection procedure (&quot;...the President in establishing the order of induction for registrants within the various age groups found qualified for induction shall not effect any change in the method of determining the relative order of induction for such registrants within such age groups as has been heretofore established...&quot;), and Nixon issued an executive order prescribing a process of random selection.

==Method==
In principle, the function of the first draft was to select dates within a calendar year at random, with men whose birthdays matched those dates being drafted according to the sequence the dates were selected. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque plastic capsules, which were then mixed in a shoebox and then placed into a deep glass jar. Capsules were drawn from the jar one at a time and opened.

The first date drawn was September 14; all registrants with that birthday were assigned lottery number 1. The next numbers drawn corresponded to April 24, December 30, February 14, October 18, and so forth. The last number drawn corresponded to June 8. All men of draft age (born January 1, 1944, to December 31, 1950) who shared a birthday would be called to serve at once. The first 195 birthdays drawn were later called to serve in the order they were drawn; the last of these was September 24.

On December 1, 1969, a second lottery, identical in process to the first, was held with the 26 letters of the alphabet. The first letter drawn was &quot;J&quot;, which was assigned number 1. The second letter was &quot;G&quot;, and so on, until all 26 letters were assigned numbers. Among men with the same birthdate, the order of induction was determined by the ranks of the first letters of their last, first, and middle names. An eligible man with initials &quot;JJJ&quot; would have been first within the shared birthdate, followed by &quot;JGJ&quot;, &quot;JDJ&quot;, and &quot;JXJ&quot;; anyone with initials &quot;VVV&quot; would have been last.

The outcome of the draft process was the subject of controversy. As with any truly random process, the results of the draft were not evenly distributed and appeared to cluster together, and it happened that November and December births, or numbers 306 to 366, were assigned mainly to lower draft order numbers representing earlier calls to serve. This led to complaints that the lottery was not truly random as the legislation required. Only five days in December—December 2, 12, 15, 17, and 19—were higher than the last call number of 195. Had the days been evenly distributed, 14 days in December would have been expected to remain uncalled. From January to December, the rank of the average draft pick numbers were 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 7, 11, and 12. A Monte Carlo simulation found that the probability of a random order of months being this close to the 1–12 sequence expected for unsorted slips was 0.09%. An analysis of the procedure suggested that &quot;The capsules were put in a box month by month, January through December, and subsequent mixing efforts were insufficient to overcome this sequencing&quot;.

==Aftermath and modification==
The draft lottery had social and economic consequences because it generated further resistance to military service. Those who resisted were generally young, well-educated, healthy men. Reluctance to serve in Vietnam led many young men to try to join the National Guard, state-based military reserve forces, as they were aware that the National Guard would be less likely to send soldiers to the war in Vietnam. Many men were unable to join the National Guard even though they had passed their physicals, because in many states National Guards had long waiting lists to enlist.p. 51. Others chose to serve in military branches like the Navy or the Coast Guard as to avoid active combat.p. 54 Still other men chose legal sanctions such as imprisonment,p. 62 showing their disapproval by illegally burning their draft cards or draft letters,p. 63 or simply not presenting themselves for military service. Others left the country, usually moving to Canada.p. 71

The 1960s were a time of turmoil in the United States, beginning with the civil rights movement which set the standards for practices by the anti-war movement. The 1969 draft lottery only encouraged resentment of the Vietnam War and the draft. It strengthened the anti-war movement, and all over the United States, people decried discrimination by the draft system &quot;against low-education, low-income, underprivileged members of society&quot;. The lottery procedure was improved the next year although public discontent continued to grow.

== Draft lottery (1970) ==

For the draft lottery held on July 1, 1970, (which covered 1951 birthdates for use during 1971, and is sometimes called the 1971 draft), scientists at the National Bureau of Standards prepared 78 random permutations of the numbers 1 to 366 using random numbers selected from published tables. From the 78 permutations, 25 were selected at random and transcribed to calendars using 1 = January 1, 2 = January 2, ... 365 = December 31. Those calendars were sealed in envelopes. Twenty-five more permutations were selected and sealed in 25 more envelopes without transcription to calendars. The two sets of 25 envelopes were furnished to the Selective Service System.

On June 2, an official picked two envelopes, thus one calendar and one raw permutation. The 365 birthdates (for 1951) were written down, placed in capsules, and put in a drum in the order dictated by the selected calendar. Similarly, the numbers from 1 to 365 were written down and placed into capsules in the order dictated by the raw permutation.

On July 1, the drawing date, one drum was rotated for an hour and the other for a half-hour (its rotating mechanism failed). Pairs of capsules were then drawn, one from each drum, one with a 1951 birthdate and one with a number 1 to 366. The first date and number drawn were September 16 and 139, so all men born September 16, 1951, were assigned draft number 139. The 11th draws were the date July 9 and the number 1, so men born July 9 were assigned draft number 1 and drafted first.

== Draft lottery (1971–1975) ==

Draft lotteries were conducted again from 1971 to 1975 (for those born between 1952 and 1956). The birth year of 1952 was the last draftees, with the assigned number 95 being the last number drafted, which represented those born on July 20, 1952. The draft numbers issued from 1972 to 1975 were not used to call any men into service as the last draft call was on December 7, and authority to induct expired July 1, 1973. They were used, however, to call some men born from 1953 to 1956 for armed forces physical examinations. The highest number called for a physical was 215 (for tables 1970 through 1976). Between 1965 and 1972 the draft provided 2,215,000 service members to the U.S. military.

<text>James Lewis Thomas Chalmers Spence (25 November 1874 – 3 March 1955) was a Scottish journalist, poet, author, folklorist and occult scholar. Spence was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and vice-president of the Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society. He founded the Scottish National Movement.

==Early life==
Spence was born in 1874 in Monifieth, Angus, Scotland. After graduating from Edinburgh University he pursued a career in journalism. He was an editor at &quot;The Scotsman&quot; 1899–1906, editor of &quot;The Edinburgh Magazine&quot; for a year, 1904–05, and then an editor at &quot;The British Weekly&quot;, 1906–09.

==Career==
In this time Spence&#x27;s interest was sparked in the myth and folklore of Mexico and Central America, resulting in his popularisation of the Mayan Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Quiché Mayans (1908). He compiled &quot;A Dictionary of Mythology&quot; (1910), an &quot;Encyclopedia of occultism and parapsychology&quot; (1920) and numerous additional volumes.

Turning his interest closer to home, he investigated Scottish folklore. An ardent Scottish Nationalist, he unsuccessfully contested a parliamentary seat for Midlothian and Peebles Northern at a by-election in 1929. He also wrote poetry, collected in 1953.

Spence wrote about Brythonic rites and traditions in &quot;Mysteries of Celtic Britain&quot; (1905). In this book, Spence theorized that the original Britons were descendants of a people that migrated from Northwest Africa and were probably related to the Berbers and the Basques.

==Atlantis==
Spence&#x27;s research into the mythology and culture of the New World, together with his examination of the cultures of western Europe and north-west Africa, led him to the question of Atlantis. During the 1920s he published a series of books which sought to rescue the topic from the occultists who had more or less brought it into disrepute. These works, including &quot;The Problem of Atlantis&quot; (1924) and &quot;History of Atlantis&quot; (1927), adopted theories inaugurated by Ignatius Donnelly and looked at the lost island as a Bronze Age civilization that formed a cultural link with the New World, which he invoked through examples he found of parallels between the early civilizations of the Old and New Worlds. Despite Spence&#x27;s erudition and the width of his reading, the conclusions he reached, avoiding peer-reviewed journals, have been almost universally rejected by mainstream scholarship. His popularisations met stiff criticism in professional journals, but his continued appeal among theory hobbyists is summed up by a reviewer of &quot;The Problem of Atlantis&quot; (1924) in &quot;The Geographical Journal&quot;: &quot;Mr. Spence is an industrious writer, and, even if he fails to convince, has done service in marshalling the evidence and has produced an entertaining volume which is well worth reading.&quot; Nevertheless, he seems to have had some influence upon the ideas of controversial author Immanuel Velikovsky, and as his books have come into the public domain, they have been successfully reprinted and some have been scanned for the Internet.

Spence&#x27;s 1940 book &quot;Occult Causes of the Present War&quot; () is an early book in the field of Nazi occultism.

==Personal life==
In 1899 he married Helen Bruce.

Over his long career, he published more than forty books, many of which remain in print to this day. Spence was also the founder of the Scottish National Movement which later merged to form the National Party of Scotland and which in turn merged to form the Scottish National Party.

==Death==
Spence died in Edinburgh in 1955 aged 80 and is buried in the north-west section of the 20th century northern extension to Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. His wife, Helen S. Bruce (d. 1942) lies with him.

<doc id="549096" wikidata="Q1369185" url="?curid=549096" title="Kyiv TV Tower">
<text>The Kyiv TV Tower () is a lattice metal tower on Oranzhereina Street, Kyiv, Ukraine, and is the tallest structure in the country. The tower was built in 1973 while Kyiv was the capital of Ukrainian SSR. The tower was the tallest freestanding metal structure in the world. It is used for radio and television broadcasting and is not open to the public. It is the tallest lattice tower in the world and third tallest structure in Europe.

== History ==
The tower was first designed for Moscow, then the Soviet capital. But Moscow authorities preferred a more &quot;solid&quot; type of tower, which was eventually built (Ostankino Tower). Later, when Kyiv needed its own tower, the project was reintroduced. The Soviet government ordered the engineers to shorten the tower by almost 30%, so as not to be as tall as the Moscow one.

=== Location ===
The tower was built on top of the Jewish cemetery in Lukianivka. The cemetery was officially closed in 1966 and Jewish families were given six months to rebury their relatives in the Jewish areas of a new cemetery in the city. Since the relatives of the interred had been killed in the Babyn Yar massacre, most of the graves were not moved. After the headstones had been destroyed or removed, the antenna was built on top of the existing graves.

=== Construction ===
Construction began in 1968 and finished in 1973 at a cost of approximately $12 million. Made of steel pipe of various diameters and thicknesses, the structure weighs . The central pipe, or core, where the elevator is located, is in diameter and made of pipe that is 12 mm thick. It sits on a four-legged base that is about meters tall. Atop the base is an enclosed level which houses microwave transmitting and receiving equipment. At about is a second enclosed level that houses television and FM transmitters, as well as a control and maintenance shop. This second level is the elevator&#x27;s terminus.

The tower is unique in that no mechanical fasteners such as rivets are used in the structure: every joint, pipe, and fixture is attached by welding. It is the first all-welded tower in the world.

=== 2022 missile strike ===

On 1 March 2022, the tower was hit by a missile fired by Russian forces during the Battle of Kyiv as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Ukrainian officials, five people were killed as a result. The dead included Yevhenii Sakun, the first journalist killed in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine state advisor Anton Herashchenko accused the Russian army of trying to disrupt the city&#x27;s communication infrastructure. According to &quot;The Kyiv Independent&quot;, Ukrainian TV channels&#x27; broadcasting was disrupted following the attack. It is unknown if the strike intended to topple the tower or if the intent was to disable its transmission and reception systems. The extent of the damage was not immediately apparent, and the tower remained standing. 

The Ukrainian foreign ministry condemned the attack due to its proximity to the memorial to the Babi Yar massacres. The Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center confirmed reports that a second missile had hit the nearby memorial, however there are contradicting reports.

<doc id="549104" wikidata="Q428614" url="?curid=549104" title="USS Honolulu (CL-48)">
<text>USS &quot;Honolulu&quot; (CL-48) of the United States Navy was a light cruiser active in the Pacific War (World War II). &quot;Honolulu&quot; was launched in 1937 and commissioned in 1938. She was the only cruiser to survive the Battle of Tassafaronga undamaged. &quot;Honolulu&quot; later served in the Battle of Kula Gulf, where she wrecked the destroyer &quot;Nagatsuki&quot; and helped to sink the destroyer &quot;Niizuki&quot;, and the Battle of Kolombangara where she helped to sink the light cruiser &quot;Jintsū&quot; but was crippled by a torpedo which blew off her bow. She then bombarded shores during the Battle of Peleliu. She was taken out of action by serious torpedo damage just before the Battle of Leyte Gulf. She was repaired, but not in time to rejoin the war. She was decommissioned in 1947 and was held in reserve until she was scrapped in 1959.

== Inter-war period ==
The second Navy ship named for the city of Honolulu, Hawaii, she was launched on 26 August 1937 at the New York Navy Yard, sponsored by Helen Poindexter (the daughter of Joseph B. Poindexter, the Governor of Hawaii), and commissioned on 15 June 1938.

After a shakedown cruise to England, &quot;Honolulu&quot; engaged in fleet problems and exercises in the Caribbean Sea. She steamed from New York on 24 May 1939 to join the Pacific Fleet, arriving at San Pedro, California, on 14 June. For the remainder of the year, she engaged in exercises along the West Coast. During the first half of 1940, &quot;Honolulu&quot; continued operations out of Long Beach, California, and after an overhaul at the Puget Sound shipyard, she steamed out of Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 5 November for duty from Pearl Harbor. She operated there through 1941.

== World War II ==
On 7 December 1941, &quot;Honolulu&quot; was moored in the Navy Yard when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor. &quot;Honolulu&quot; went unscathed in the first wave, but in the second wave was attacked by Japanese dive bombers, but suffered only minor hull damage from a near miss from a 500-pound bomb that exploded under the water and caved in a section of &quot;Honolulu&#x27;s&quot; hull, one of three cruisers to take any notable damage through the attack. Damage was quickly patched up in just 5 days.

Following repairs, she sailed on 12 January 1942 to escort a convoy to San Francisco, California, arriving on 21 January. After arriving at the Mare Island shipyards, &quot;Honolulu&quot; departed for Melbourne Australia on the 31st, arriving at her destination on 26 February, where the ship would guard various Australian ports on patrol duties until the 20 March when she departed back to Pearl Harbor, arriving there a week later. On 8 April, she arrived at San Diego, with the task of escorting a convoy alongside several other US cruisers departing from San Diego to bound for Bora Bora in French Polynesia, leaving on the 13th and arriving on the 28th, and after some guard duties departed back to Pearl Harbor on 19 May.

With the Japanese pushing north towards Alaska, &quot;Honolulu&quot; departed on 29 May to strengthen forces in that area. After two months of continuous operations out of Kodiak, Alaska, she proceeded to Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on 7 August, to begin bombardment of the island. On 21 August, she screened the first American landings in the Aleutians at Adak Island. After shipyard work at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, &quot;Honolulu&quot; departed from San Francisco on 3 November 1942, escorting a convoy to Nouméa in the South Pacific. Later that month, &quot;Honolulu&quot; sailed from Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands to intercept a Japanese Navy convoy attempting to reinforce their positions on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.

=== Battle of Tassafaronga ===
Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, the US suffered major losses in cruisers, with ten cruisers either sunk or taken out of action due to battle damage. &quot;Honolulu&quot; served in what was essentially the last of America&#x27;s active cruisers operating in Guadalcanal. Rear Admiral Wright made his flagship the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, and alongside &quot;Honolulu&quot; he commanded the heavy cruisers USS &quot;New Orleans&quot;, USS &quot;Pensacola&quot;, and USS &quot;Northampton&quot;. The force was escorted by six destroyers. The squadron was formed on 24 November.

On the 29th, American code breakers intercepted a message about a Japanese supply run. Admiral Tanaka commanded a total of eight destroyers delivering much needed supplies to Japanese troops on Guadalcanal. With Wright&#x27;s force having a nearly equal number of destroyers, and the Japanese having no cruisers enroute, Wright saw an easy victory and took his ships to intercept and destroy the enemy ships. However, the Japanese had a trick up their sleeve, the type 93 &quot;long lance&quot; torpedoes, which were larger and more powerful, and most importantly had a longer range than any other widely used torpedo of the war, with a maximum range of 44,200 yards and a designed effective range of 24,000 yards. This was unknown to the allies.

Because of this, on the night of 30 November, &quot;Honolulu&quot; and the other ships intercepted Tanaka&#x27;s destroyers and opened fire within 12,000 yards, well within the long lance&#x27;s effective range. &quot;Honolulu&quot;, along with &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot;, engaged the &quot;Takanami&quot;, and hit her with shells that set her aflame and rendered her a slowly sinking hulk, but not before &quot;Takanami&quot; fired her torpedoes, and it would be these torpedoes and hit both &quot;New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, crippling both ships and taking them out of action. &quot;Honolulu&quot; continued to charge on, but her crew realized that the remaining destroyers fired another torpedo spread as a long lance fired from the &quot;Oyashio&quot; hit &quot;Pensacola&quot;, disabling her engine and three of her four 8-inch (203 mm) gun turrets. Quick thinking by Rear Admiral Tisdale ordered &quot;Honolulu&quot; to take a hard turn to starboard, barely avoiding a torpedo in the process, allowing &quot;Honolulu&quot; to avoid any damage whatsoever. &quot;Northampton&quot; failed to do the same and continued in a straight line, and she paid the price as she was hit by two torpedoes fired from the &quot;Kawakaze&quot; which caused her to sink over two hours.

Having been the only cruiser of the battle to survive completely undamaged, &quot;Honolulu&quot; retreated from Guadalcanal, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 2 December, and remained there for the rest of the month. On 2 January 1942, &quot;Honolulu&quot; joined with several other allied cruisers on patrol duty, and on the 5th the force came under air attacks, where &quot;Honolulu&quot; was lightly damaged by three bomb near misses. Throughout the rest of January and into February, &quot;Honolulu&quot; took part in a series of patrol duties, then on 7 March she covered minelayers in the Blackett Strait, before taking part in even more patrol duties. On 11 May, Honolulu departed Espiritu Santa, and on the 13th she bombarded Japanese shore positions in the Kula Gulf.

=== Battle of Kula Gulf ===

On 4 July, &quot;Honolulu&quot;, along with the light cruisers USS &quot;Helena&quot; and USS &quot;Saint Louis&quot; and four destroyers, departed the Soloman Islands on patrol duty. On the 5th, a Japanese torpedo hit and sank the destroyer USS &quot;Strong&quot;. This was believed to be from an enemy submarine, but this torpedo was actually launched from the destroyer &quot;Niizuki&quot; at a distance of 22,000 yards, one of the longest ranged torpedo hits in history (alongside the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot; torpedoing and sinking the destroyer &quot;Kortenaer&quot; at a similar distance). However, the presence of US ships did force the Japanese destroyer transports carrying 1,300 infantry troops to retreat.

Later that night, the &quot;Niizuki&quot;, joined by the destroyers &quot;Suzukaze&quot; and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; departed as a protection force for seven other destroyers transporting 2,400 ground troops in a second attempt to run infantry to Kula Gulf. &quot;Honolulu&quot; and the other American ships prepared to intercept and either destroy or send back this force. By 2:00, &quot;Honolulu&quot; picked up three Japanese ships on her radar, it was &quot;Niizuki,&quot; &quot;Suzukaze&quot;, and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; closing the range to attack the force with torpedoes. &quot;Honolulu&quot;, &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, and &quot;Helena&quot; all opened fire, all targeting &quot;Niizuki&quot;. A barrage of 6-inch (152 mm) and 5-inch (127 mm) shell hits quickly reduced &quot;Niizuki&quot; into a burning hulk and sank her with no survivors. However, &quot;Helena&quot; quickly expended her smokeless propellants, and the resulting gun flashes caused &quot;Suzukaze&quot; and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; to quickly fire their torpedoes and evacuate the area. One of these torpedoes first blew of &quot;Helena&#x27;s&quot; bow in a potential magazine explosion. Two minutes later, two more torpedoes destroyed her engines and boilers and broke her keel. Within a few minutes, &quot;Helena&quot; capsized and sank. 

&quot;Honolulu&quot; continued to fire at the Japanese ships. One of &quot;Honolulu&#x27;s&quot; 6-inch (152 mm) shells hit the destroyer &quot;Nagatsuki&quot; below the waterline, wrecking her engine room and damaging her so badly she was forced to run aground. &quot;Nagatsuki&quot; was unable to be refloated, and deemed a complete wreck and abandoned. Further shelling by both &quot;Honolulu&quot; and &quot;Saint Louis&quot; hit the destroyer &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; six times which damaged her steering and killed six men, but all hits were duds as she withdrew from the battle. However, the Japanese were still able to land 1,600 ground troops, alongside sinking far more tonnage than they lost. After the battle, &quot;Honolulu&quot; briefly visited Espiritu Santa, before departing on 10 July for additional patrol duties.

=== Battle of Kolombangara ===
On 12 July, &quot;Honolulu&quot; was still on patrol duties alongside &quot;Saint Louis and&quot; was now joined by the New Zealand light cruiser HMZNS &quot;Leander&quot;, which was sent to replace the sunken &quot;Helena&quot;, alongside 10 destroyers, when allied coastwatchers alerted the ships of a nearby Japanese force. Four Japanese destroyer transports carrying 1,200 ground troops were enroute to Kolombangara, with a protection of a destroyer line consisting of the &quot;Yukikaze, Hamakaze, Kiyonami&quot;, and &quot;Yūgure&quot;. Trailing behind these destroyers was the light cruiser &quot;Jintsū&quot;, the Japanese flagship, supported by the elderly destroyer &quot;Mikazuki&quot;. The force rapidly sped to engage the Japanese ships, and at 1:03 in the morning of the 13th had located the force, closing to 10,400 yards (9,500 meters) away. Opening up the battle, &quot;Jintsū&quot; lit up her searchlights and illuminated the allied ships and opened fire, hitting &quot;Leander&quot; with a 14 cm (5.5 in) shell. However, in turn the US ships opened fire, and all targeted the Japanese cruiser. &quot;Honolulu&quot; peppered &quot;Jintsū&quot; with her main guns, and in turn was not hit once as the American gunfire hit &quot;Jintsū&quot; again and again.

By around 1:20, 6-inch (152 mm) gunfire mostly from &quot;Honolulu&quot; and &quot;Saint Louis&quot; blasted &quot;Jintsū&quot; into a floating wreck, setting her on fire and leaving her dead in the water and without a functional gun. American destroyers closed to point blank range to deliver the final blow, and at least one torpedo probably from USS &quot;Taylor&quot; finished her off. However, simultaneously a type 93 torpedo probably from &quot;Yukikaze&quot; hit &quot;Leander&quot;, forcing her to retire from the battle (she was damaged so badly she could not be repaired in time to take further part in WW2, and never served as a New Zealand warship again, making up for Jintsū&#x27;s loss). For the next half hour, the American warships swept for the Japanese destroyers, and by 1:50 had spotted the destroyer line. &quot;Honolulu&quot; opened fire, straddling &quot;Yukikaze&quot; several times, but scoring no hits, and several minutes later the Japanese destroyers fired their torpedoes again. Two of these torpedoes hit &quot;Honolulu&quot;. One torpedo hit the stern, but did not explode, but the other blew &quot;Honolulu&#x27;s&quot; bow clean off. Moments later, a third torpedo badly damaged &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, twisting her bow to the port side, while a fourth sank the destroyer USS &quot;Gwin&quot;. 
&quot;Honolulu&quot; was forced to sail in reverse to Tulagi harbor, but managed to make it to repairs. She was patched up with a temporary bow, and further sailed to the repair ship USS &quot;Vestal&quot;, arriving on 16 July. She remained moored to &quot;Vestal&quot; until 6 August, where after enough repairs were completed, she sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving on the 16th where she was drydocked, where repairs lasted until 2 September. &quot;Honolulu&quot; was taken out of drydock and departed for the Mare Island naval shipyards to be further repaired, arriving four days later.
On 17 November, repairs were finally completed, and &quot;Honolulu&quot; departed California to continue her role in the struggle against Japan. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 11 December, and then resumed operations in the Solomons later that month. On 27 December, she engaged in the bombardment of an enemy barge, troop, and supply concentration on Bougainville Island. In the early months of 1944, the cruiser continued bombardments and patrols in the Solomon Islands. She screened the landings on Green Island on 13 February, before retiring from the Solomons to begin preparations for the Saipan and Guam operations in the Mariana Islands.

&quot;Honolulu&quot; took part in bombardments of the southeastern part of Saipan Island in early June as the Navy and Marines leaped across the Pacific. While bombarding Guam in mid-June, &quot;Honolulu&quot; was deployed northwest to intercept the Japanese fleet. She returned to Eniwetok Atoll on 28 June for replenishments, before providing support for the invasion of Guam. She remained on station for three weeks, performing great service with her accurate gunfire, before returning to Purvis Bay on Florida Island in the Solomons on 18 August. &quot;Honolulu&quot; steamed out on 6 September to provide fire support for the landings in the Palau Islands, such as at Peleliu Island and Anguar, remaining in this area during September unopposed by the Japanese fleet. America now had decisive command of the sea, and therefore nearly full freedom of operations.

=== Battle of Leyte ===

&quot;Honolulu&quot; departed from the staging area at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands on 12 October, and steamed towards the Philippines for the invasion of Leyte. She began a bombardment from Leyte Gulf on 19 October, and the next day she began screening the landings. At 1600, on 20 October an enemy torpedo plane was sighted as it aimed its torpedo at &quot;Honolulu&quot;. Despite the skillful maneuvering of Captain Thurber to evade, the torpedo found its mark on her port side. 64 men were killed and 35 were injured.

&quot;Honolulu&quot; sailed out the next day, arriving at Manus on 29 October for temporary repairs, and then steamed for Norfolk, Virginia, on 19 November, arriving on 20 December via Pearl Harbor, San Diego, California, and the Panama Canal. &quot;Honolulu&quot; remained at Norfolk for the duration of the war, undergoing repairs and alterations which included the installation of four twin 5in/38 gun mounts, and after a shakedown cruise in October 1945, she steamed to Newport, Rhode Island, for duty as a training ship. &quot;Honolulu&quot; arrived at Philadelphia on 8 January 1946 and was decommissioned there on 3 February 1947, and joined the Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia. Stricken on 1 March 1959, &quot;Honolulu&quot; was sold for scrapping to Bethlehem Steel, Baltimore, Maryland, on 12 October 1959. &quot;Honolulu&quot; was scrapped at Sparrow Point, Maryland, on 19 August 1960.

<doc id="549111" wikidata="Q1956886" url="?curid=549111" title="Mystagogue">
<text>A mystagogue (from ) is a person who initiates others into mystic beliefs, and an educator or person who has knowledge of the sacred mysteries of a belief system. Another word for mystagogue is hierophant.

==Origins==
In ancient mystery religions, a mystagogue would be responsible for leading an initiate into the secret teachings and rituals of a cultus. The initiate would often be blindfolded, and the mystagogue would literally &quot;guide&quot; him into the sacred space.

In the early Christian church, this same concept was used to describe role of the bishop, who was responsible for seeing to it that the catechumens were properly prepared for baptism. Mystagogical homilies, or homilies that dealt with the Church&#x27;s sacraments, were given to those in the last stages of preparation for full Church membership. Sometimes these mystagogical instructions were not given until after the catechumen had been baptized. The most famous of these mystagogical works are the &quot;Mystagogical Homilies&quot; of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, and the work, &quot;On the Mysteries&quot; by St. Ambrose of Milan.

==Typologies==
In various organizations, it is the role of the mystagogue to &quot;mystify&quot; pledges. The term is sometimes used to refer to a person who guides people through religious sites, such as churches, and explains the various artifacts. This branch of theology is at times called mystagogy.

In the United States versions of mystagogical legends predate European contact. Early Native American tribes around the Great Lakes region, taught that the mystagogue was a spiritual leader, and upon death would transform into a beast with many heads. The mystagogue would reappear in his beastly form and feed on those who strayed from the tribe if it was not in keeping with their religious customs.

The historical tradition of the mystagogue has carried on today in one way through the fraternity system in American universities, that have historically held a position for a mystagogue at either the chapter or the national level. The mystagogue is a person of great respect, and his knowledge concerning both the physical and spiritual matters of the organization is not questioned. In a way similar to that of some Native American traditions, the mystagogue in the fraternity system has the power to shut down parts of the fraternity which are not in keeping with customs or tradition.

Max Weber, considered to be one of the founders of the modern study of sociology, described the mystagogue as part magician and part prophet, and as one who dispensed &quot;magical actions that contain the boons of salvation.&quot;

According to Roy Wallis: &quot;The primary criterion that Weber had in mind in distinguishing the &quot;prophet&quot; from the &quot;mystagogue&quot; was that the latter offers a largely magical means of salvation rather than proclaiming a radical religious ethic or an example to be followed.&quot;

<text>The Gerbrandy Tower () is a radio tower in IJsselstein, the Netherlands. It is also known as Lopik tower after the nearby town. It was built in 1961.

==Description==
The Gerbrandy Tower is used for directional radio services and for FM- and TV-broadcasting. The Gerbrandy Tower consists of a concrete tower with a height of 100 meters (328&#x27;) on which a guyed aerial mast is mounted. Its total height was originally 382.5 metres (1255&#x27;), but in 1987 it was reduced to 375 metres (1230&#x27;).

On August 2, 2007, its analog antenna was replaced by a digital one reducing its height by another 9 metres (30&#x27;). Its height is now 366.8 metres (1203&#x27;).

This tower type is a partially guyed tower, which combines a lower free standing tower antennas with an upper guyed mast. If the structure is counted as a tower, it is the tallest tower in Western Europe. The Gerbrandy Tower is not the only tower which consists of a concrete tower on which a guyed mast is set. There is one similar but smaller tower with the same structure in the Netherlands, the radio tower of Zendstation Smilde, which consisted of an 80 metres (262&#x27;) high concrete tower, on which a 223.5 metres (733&#x27;) high guyed mast was mounted. This structure collapsed after a fire on July 15, 2011. Rebuilding of that tower started in late 2011 and was completed in October 2012; the replacement structure is also a partially guyed tower, now 303 metres (995&#x27;) high.

===Naming===
The tower is named after Pieter Gerbrandy, Prime Minister of the Netherlands during World War Two.

Nearby, there is another remarkable antenna: the KNMI-mast Cabauw, a mast used for meteorological measurements.

Another nearby antenna, the 196 metre (643&#x27;) high mediumwave transmitter Lopik, was demolished on September 4, 2015.

==Fires in Dutch TV masts==
On July 15, 2011, there was a small fire in the Gerbrandy tower. Only hours later, a similar tower in Smilde caught fire and collapsed, after which all transmitters in the Gerbrandy tower were shut down as a precaution, leaving large parts of the Netherlands without FM-radio and digital TV (DVB-T) reception.

==Owner==
The ownership of the tower is complex: the concrete main structure is owned by Alticom: a company established in 2007 that bought many assets from KPN. Alticom was part of the European TDG Group, but in June 2011 it was announced that all shares in Alticom were acquired by investment company Infracapital who are the infrastructure specialists of Prudential plc.

Alticom is the owner of the concrete base and the first three meters (10&#x27;) of ground around this base. The metal mast on top of the structure is owned by NOVEC, which is a subsidiary of the electricity transmission operator TenneT. The ground on which the tower is built, excluding the first three meters (10&#x27;) around the base, is (still) owned by KPN.

<text>In the United States Navy, officers have various ranks. Equivalency between services is by pay grade. United States Navy commissioned officer ranks have two distinct sets of rank insignia: On dress uniform a series of stripes similar to Commonwealth naval ranks are worn; on service khaki, working uniforms (Navy Working Uniform [NWU], and coveralls), and special uniform situations (combat utilities, flight suits, and USMC uniforms when worn by Navy officers assigned or attached to USMC units), the rank insignia are identical to the equivalent rank in the US Marine Corps.

== Commissioned officer ranks==
==Warrant officer ranks==
==Rank categories==
In the U.S. Navy, pay grades for officers are:

*W-1 for warrant officer one. Warrant officers appointed to this grade are normally done via a warrant from the Secretary of the Navy.
*W-2 to W-5 for chief warrant officers. Chief warrant officers (CWO2 to CWO5) are appointed via commission.
*O-1 to O-10. Officers appointed to these grades are done via commission.
**O-1 through O-4 are junior officers: ensign, lieutenant (junior grade), lieutenant, and lieutenant commander. 
**O-5 and O-6 are senior officers: commander and captain. 
**O-7 through O-10 are flag officers: rear admiral (lower half) (one star), rear admiral (two stars), vice admiral (three stars), and admiral (four stars).
*Fleet admiral was a five-star flag officer rank. It was awarded to four officers during World War II and has not been authorized since. However, the rank of fleet admiral still remains listed on official rank insignia precedence charts and, if needed, this rank could be reestablished at the discretion of Congress and the President. All five-star officers are, technically, unable to retire from active duty. The last living fleet admiral, Chester W. Nimitz, died in 1966.

==Rank and promotion system==
If an officer demonstrates superior performance and proves themselves capable of performing at the next higher pay grade, then they are given an increase in pay grade. The official term for this process is a promotion.

Commissioned naval officers originate from the United States Naval Academy, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, other Service Academies (United States Military Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy, or United States Air Force Academy), Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), Officer Candidate School (OCS), the since-disestablished Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS), and a host of other commissioning programs such as the &quot;Seaman to Admiral-21&quot; program and the limited duty officer/chief warrant officer (LDO/CWO) selection program. There are also a small number of direct commissioned officers, primarily staff corps officers in the medical, dental, nurse, chaplain and judge advocate general career fields.

Commissioned officers can generally be divided into line officers and staff corps:

*Line officers (or &quot;officers of the line&quot;) derive their name from the 18th-century tactic of employing warships in a line of battle to take advantage of cannon on each side of the ship. These vessels were dubbed ships of the line and those who commanded them were likewise called &quot;line officers.&quot; Today, all United States Navy unrestricted line and restricted line officers denote their status with a star located above their rank insignia on the sleeves of their dress blue uniforms and shoulder boards of their white uniforms; metal rank insignia devices on both collar-points of khaki shirts/blouses; and cloth equivalents on both collar-points of blue NWUs. Officers of the staff corps replace the star (or the left collar-point on applicable shirts/blouses) with different insignias to indicate their field of specialty. Line officers can be categorized into unrestricted and restricted communities.
**Unrestricted line officers (URL) are the most visible and well-known of line officers, due to their role as the Navy&#x27;s war-fighting command element. They receive training in weapons systems, tactics, strategy, command and control, and are considered unrestricted because they are authorized to command combatant ships, combat aviation squadrons/air groups/air wings, and special operations units at sea, or combat aviation squadrons/air groups/air wings or special operations units deployed ashore. URL officers are naval aviators (and Naval Aviator-Astronauts), Naval Flight Officers (and Naval Flight Officer-Astronauts), Surface Warfare Officers, Submarine Warfare Officers, Special Warfare Officers (e.g., Sea-Air-Land, or SEAL Officers), and Special Operations/Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Officers.
**Restricted line officers (RL) concentrate on non-combat related fields, which include marine engineering, aeronautical engineering, ship maintenance, aircraft maintenance, meteorology and oceanography, naval intelligence, information technology, manpower/human resources, public affairs, and a host of other career fields. They are not qualified to command combat units, but can command organizations in their respective specialized career fields. In certain shipboard environments, many unrestricted line officers fill what might be considered restricted line duties, such as the officers in a ship&#x27;s or submarine&#x27;s engineering department. Because they maintain their general surface warfare or submarine warfare specialist duties instead of completely specializing in one career area, they maintain their unrestricted line command career path.
*Staff corps officers are specialists in fields that are themselves professional careers and not exclusive to the military, for example health care, law, civil engineering and religion. There are eight staff corps: Medical Corps, Dental Corps, Nurse Corps, Medical Service Corps, Chaplain Corps, Navy Supply Corps, Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, and Civil Engineer Corps. They primarily exist to augment the line communities and are able to be assigned to both line and staff commands. One exception to this is the case of Civil Engineer Corps officers, who serve as both the Public Works Officers and Resident Officers in Charge of Construction (ROICC) at naval shore installations, and as officers for Construction Battalion (Seabee) units. This latter role requires them to serve in a command capacity for ground combatants when the Seabees are deployed to combat areas.

Note 2: See also Commodore (United States) — today an honorific title (but not a pay grade) for selected URL captains (O-6) in major command of multiple subordinate operational units, and formerly a rank (O-7).

Note 3: The term &quot;line officer of the naval service&quot; includes line officers of both the Navy and the Marine Corps. All U.S. Marine Corps officers are considered &quot;of the line,&quot; including Marine Corps limited duty officers, chief warrant officers, and warrant officers, regardless of grade or specialty.

===&quot;Tombstone promotions&quot;===
The Act of Congress of March 4, 1925, provided for Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard officers to be promoted one grade upon retirement, if they had been specially commended for performance of duty in actual combat, known as &quot;tombstone promotions&quot;. Officers who received such tombstone promotions, or also known as &quot;tombstone officer&quot;, carried the loftier title but did not draw the additional retirement pay of their higher rank. The Act of Congress of February 23, 1942, enabled promotions to three- and four-star grades. Promotions were subsequently restricted to citations issued before January 1, 1947, and finally eliminated altogether effective November 1, 1959.

Any officer who served honorably in a grade while on active duty receives precedence on the retirement list over any &quot;tombstone officers&quot; of the same grade, while &quot;tombstone officers&quot; of the same grade rank among each other according to their dates of rank in their highest active duty grade.

==Officer designator devices==
The Navy uses the term designator, instead of the term military occupational specialty (MOS) or Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), to determine an officer&#x27;s job specialty. Navy officers are designated as either as a line officer or as a staff corps officer. Unrestricted line (URL) and restricted line (RL) officers wear an embroidered gold star above their rank of the naval service dress uniform and, if they are in a rank below rear admiral (lower half), their shoulder board insignia, while staff corps officers and chief warrant officers wear unique designator devices.

The chief warrant officer and staff corps devices are also worn on the left collar of uniforms.

<text>The Liberation Tower is a 372-meter-high or 1,220 feet tall telecommunications tower in Kuwait City, Kuwait. It is the second-tallest structure in the country and the 39th tallest building in the world. The tower is not publicly accessible to tourists. However, the complex building attached to the tower houses government offices such as the Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority and a government service center that offer civil services related to Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Public Authority For Civil Information, Ministry of Justice, Public Institution for Social Security, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Fire Service Directorate, and Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour.
==History==

Originally intended to be named The Kuwait Telecommunications Tower, construction of the tower commenced before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. When the invasion took place, construction, which was almost half-way complete, was put on hold. However, the structure received no damage, and construction resumed after Iraqi forces were expelled on February 27, 1991. Upon completion in 1993, the tower was renamed the Liberation Tower, symbolizing Kuwait&#x27;s liberation from Iraq. The tower bears a notable resemblance to Telstra Tower in Canberra, Australia.

<text>The Almaty Television Tower (; ), or simply Almaty Tower, formally the Koktobe TV Tower (; ) is a steel television tower built between 1975 and 1983 in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The tower is located on high slopes of Kok Tobe mountain ( means &quot;green hill&quot;) south-east of downtown Almaty. Unlike other similar TV towers, it is not a concrete, but a steel tubular structure. It is the tallest free-standing tubular steel structure in the world.

The tower is 371.5 m (1,219 ft) tall; its 114 m metal aerial reaches 1000 meters above sea level. It has two observation decks at the height of 146 m and 252 m, which are accessible by two high-speed elevators. It is however not open to the public.

On the north-western wall of the tower, in honor of the launch of the Soyuz T-12 spacecraft, one of the largest mosaics in the city was installed, 20 meters long and 8 meters high. The authors of the mosaic, which displays satellites and astronauts, are unknown. The tower contains several tunnels leading to a bomb shelter.

==History==
The tower was built by the architects Terziev, Savchenko, Akimov and Ostroumov. The design of the KM stage was developed in the department of high-rise structures of the under the guidance of B. V. Ostroumov, with the participation of &quot;Fundamentproekt&quot; (Moscow) and the Kazakh branch of the &quot;Central Research and Design Institute of Steel and Structures&quot;. The tower&#x27;s structures were manufactured and assembled by the &quot;Kazmontazhstroydetal&quot; and &quot;Kazstalmontazh&quot; trusts of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic&#x27;s &quot;Minmontazhspetsstroy&quot;.

The tower entered operation on 1 June 1984, having cost 600 million rubles. In October 1984 there was a fire in the tower: TV transmitter feeders burned due to errors in calculating the distribution of radio radiation power over the antenna panels. 

== Reconstruction ==
In March 2012, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Akimat of Almaty signed an agreement on the reconstruction and modernization of the TV tower and the surrounding area, starting the following year. The plan involves opening the tower to tourists.

== Monument status ==
On 10 November 2010, a new State List of Historical and Cultural Monuments of Local Significance in Almaty was approved, simultaneously with which all previous decisions on this subject were declared invalid. In this decree, the status of the Koktobe TV Tower as a monument of local importance was preserved. The boundaries of the protection zones were approved in 2014.

<doc id="549135" wikidata="Q543051" url="?curid=549135" title="Ready Steady Cook">
<text>Ready Steady Cook is a BBC daytime TV cooking game show. It debuted on 24 October 1994 and the last original edition was broadcast on 2 February 2010. The programme was hosted by Fern Britton from 1994 until 2000 when celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott became the new host. In August 2000, when Harriott took over, the duration of the programme was extended from 30 to 45 minutes.

On 2 September 2019, it was confirmed that Rylan Clark-Neal would host a revived daytime series on BBC One in 2020. On 7 September 2021, it was announced by the BBC that the series ended after two series.

==Format==
===Ingredients===
Two members of the public provided two celebrity chefs with a bag of ingredients they had bought, usually to a set budget of £5. Essential ingredients such as bread, milk, eggs etc. are provided by the show. The two teams were designated &quot;red tomato&quot; and &quot;green pepper&quot; (referred to as &quot;red kitchen&quot; and &quot;green kitchen&quot; after the August 2007 revamp, though the tomato and pepper motifs still featured on the guests&#x27; aprons and in the show&#x27;s logo).

Occasionally, the permitted budget was increased: a so-called Bistro Bag allowed for ingredients of up to £7.50, while the Gourmet Bag could have a value of up to £10. On some occasions, they used a £3.50 Budget Bag. Also on a few shows, a Lucky Dip Bag was used, which contained ten items. The chef closed their eyes and picked out half of the items at the beginning. At the halfway mark, the chef randomly picked a sixth item, which might have helped or hindered the chef. The chefs had no prior knowledge of the ingredients they had to prepare. Another format was used on occasion in which both kitchens were given the same ingredients and the toss of a red and green die determined who had first pick.

===The Main Course===
The chefs had to make several dishes out of the said ingredients in 20 minutes, with the help of the contestants and the programme host. As the contestants taste the prepared food, the host asks the chef some questions about their dish. Prior to the September 2006 season it was customary for the chefs to name their creations, which usually included a pun.

The preparations were voted on by the studio audience, who each held up a card showing either a red tomato or green pepper. In the newer episodes, the audience members pushed a button on their seat keypad to indicate who they would like to win. The winner received a cash prize of £100, which celebrity guests donated to charity (an example the regular guests sometimes followed) but this was changed to a plate towards the end of the series. The runner-up used to receive a hamper which included a variety of items, such as a set of knives, pasta and sauces, olive oil and balsamic vinegar but later received a &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot; mug due to budget restraints.

===Quickie bag===
The quickie bag section of the show then followed. This was introduced in 2000, the same year Ainsley Harriott became presenter (having previously been one of the celebrity chefs on the programme during Fern Britton&#x27;s tenure as host), extending the programme from 30 to 45 minutes. The contents of the quickie bag used to be decided on by the series producer and a home economist. Their decision was based on produce that was currently in season or unusual ingredients that had not featured on the show recently. In late August 2007, the quickie bag changed format with the bag being brought in by an audience member, who challenged the chefs to prepare the dish.

The two chefs each had a chance to describe what they would cook using the bag of ingredients and the audience members voted to choose which dish they would like to see prepared. The winner then had 10 minutes to complete the described dishes, with the help of the other chef and Ainsley. The hectic preparation of the chosen chef&#x27;s suggested dishes often includes a slight element of chaos and ad-libbing along the way. A viewer&#x27;s question relating to a cooking problem is usually put to the chefs, further adding to the pressure upon them to complete their dishes in the time allowed.

===Variations on the format===
* Classic Bag – The original format where the contestant brought in a bag of ingredients costing up to £5.
* Budget Bag – Similar to the &#x27;Classic Bag&#x27; but the ingredients could only cost up to £3.50.
* Bistro Bag – Ingredients worth £7.50.
* Gourmet Bag – Worth £10.
* Doubling Up Bag – Both contestants bring in the same ingredients. The host used a coin or die with a Green Pepper and Red Tomato on to decide which chef would decide what to do with the ingredients first. The other chef must do something different.
* Forfeit Bag – The chefs had to choose a card at random with a forfeit which prohibited their use of a certain store cupboard ingredient such as No Fresh Herbs, No Spices, No Citrus or No Wine.
* Gamble Bag – The chefs were presented with three mystery ingredients and are given the opportunity to swap one of their ingredients with one of these mystery ingredients. They do not have to swap but if they do, they cannot change their minds once the new ingredient is revealed.
* Lucky Dip – The Chefs were presented with a bag of ten items from which they had to pick five at random. After 10 minutes had passed, they then chose a sixth ingredient, which depending on what the chef has started cooking, can help or hinder them.

==&quot;Celebrity Ready Steady Cook&quot;==
Originally as a spin-off that ran alongside the original, &quot;Celebrity Ready Steady Cook&quot; had celebrities, often competing against a family member or friend, provide the bag of ingredients to the same budget of £5. Later series would see the public completely replaced with celebrity guests.

Celebrity appearances include: David Tennant, Wendy Richard, Kate Winslet, Honor Blackman, James May, Richard Hammond, Paul O&#x27;Grady as alter-ego Lily Savage, Cliff Richard, Twiggy, Rakie Ayola, Fiona Bruce, Gail Porter, Midge Ure, Edd China, Amanda Redman, Ade Edmondson and Alan Davies.

==Revived series==
In September 2019, the BBC announced that &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot; would return.

Returning in March 2020, &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; finalist Rylan Clark-Neal serves as host. He is joined by chefs Ellis Barrie, Romy Gill, Anna Haugh, Akis Petretzikis, and Mike Reid.

&quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot; introduced various sustainability efforts, including favouring glass over plastic, initiating a recycling programme, donating leftover food to a local food bank, and using locally sourced seasonal ingredients and Fair Trade items when available.

The second series following the revival started airing in March 2021. Clark-Neal returned as host, with the chef team largely remaining the same. Jeremy Pang replaced Mike Reid as Reid was unable to return to the UK from Australia during the pandemic. For the first time, the chefs decided the winner as the show was filmed without an audience.

<text>The illusion of control is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events. It was named by U.S. psychologist Ellen Langer and is thought to influence gambling behavior and belief in the paranormal. Along with illusory superiority and optimism bias, the illusion of control is one of the positive illusions.

==Definition==
The illusion of control is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events, for example, when someone feels a sense of control over outcomes that they demonstrably do not influence. 

The illusion might arise because a person lacks direct introspective insight into whether they are in control of events. This has been called the introspection illusion. Instead, they may judge their degree of control by a process which is often unreliable. As a result, they see themselves as responsible for events to which there is little or no causal link. For example, in one study, college students were in a virtual reality setting to treat a fear of heights using an elevator. Those who were told that they had control, yet had none, felt as though they had as much control as those who actually did have control over the elevator. Those who were led to believe they did not have control said they felt as though they had little control.

==History==
Psychological theorists have consistently emphasized the importance of perceptions of control over life events. One of the earliest instances was when Alfred Adler argued that people strive for proficiency in their lives. Heider later proposed that humans have a strong motive to control their environment and Wyatt Mann hypothesized a basic competence motive that people satisfy by exerting control. Wiener, an attribution theorist, modified his original theory of achievement motivation to include a controllability dimension. Kelley then argued that people&#x27;s failure to detect noncontingencies may result in their attributing uncontrollable outcomes to personal causes. Nearer to the present, Taylor and Brown argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, foster mental health.

The effect was named by U.S. psychologist Ellen Langer and has been replicated in many different contexts.

==Occurrence==
The illusion is more common in familiar situations, and in situations where the person knows the desired outcome. Feedback that emphasizes success rather than failure can increase the effect, while feedback that emphasizes failure can decrease or reverse the effect. The illusion is weaker for depressed individuals and is stronger when individuals have an emotional need to control the outcome. The illusion is strengthened by stressful and competitive situations, including financial trading. Although people are likely to overestimate their control when the situations are heavily chance-determined, they also tend to underestimate their control when they actually have it, which runs contrary to some theories of the illusion and its adaptiveness. People also showed a higher illusion of control when they were allowed to become familiar with a task through practice trials, make their choice before the event happens like with throwing dice, and when they can make their choice rather than have it made for them with the same odds. People are more likely to show control when they have more answers right at the beginning than at the end, even when the people had the same number of correct answers.

Being in a position of power enhances the illusion of control, which may lead to overreach in risk taking.

==By proxy==
At times, people attempt to gain control by transferring responsibility to more capable or “luckier” others to act for them. By forfeiting direct control, it is perceived to be a valid way of maximizing outcomes. This illusion of control by proxy is a significant theoretical extension of the traditional illusion of control model. People will of course give up control if another person is thought to have more knowledge or skill in areas such as medicine where actual skill and knowledge are involved. In cases like these it is entirely rational to give up responsibility to people such as doctors. However, when it comes to events of pure chance, allowing another to make decisions (or gamble) on one&#x27;s behalf, because they are seen as luckier is not rational and would go against people&#x27;s well-documented desire for control in uncontrollable situations. However, it does seem plausible since people generally believe that they can possess luck and employ it to advantage in games of chance, and it is not a far leap that others may also be seen as lucky and able to control uncontrollable events. In a study conducted in Singapore, the perception of control, luck, and skill when gambling led to an increase in gambling behavior.

In one instance, a lottery pool at a company decides who picks the numbers and buys the tickets based on the wins and losses of each member. The member with the best record becomes the representative until they accumulate a certain number of losses and then a new representative is picked based on wins and losses. Even though no member is truly better than the other and it is all by chance, they still would rather have someone with seemingly more luck to have control over them.

In another real-world example, in the 2002 Olympics men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey finals, Team Canada beat Team USA. Prior to the match, a Canadian coin was secretly placed under the ice before the game, an action which the players and officials believed would bring them luck. The members of Team Canada were the only people who knew the coin had been placed there. The coin was later put in the Hockey Hall of Fame where there was an opening so people could touch it. People believed they could transfer luck from the coin to themselves by touching it, and thereby change their own luck.

==Demonstration==
The illusion of control is demonstrated by three converging lines of evidence: 1) laboratory experiments, 2) observed behavior in familiar games of chance such as lotteries, and 3) self-reports of real-world behavior.

===Laboratory experiments===
One kind of laboratory demonstration involves two lights marked &quot;Score&quot; and &quot;No Score&quot;. Subjects have to try to control which one lights up. In one version of this experiment, subjects could press either of two buttons. Another version had one button, which subjects decided on each trial to press or not. Subjects had a variable degree of control over the lights, or none at all, depending on how the buttons were connected. The experimenters made clear that there might be no relation between the subjects&#x27; actions and the lights. Subjects estimated how much control they had over the lights. These estimates bore no relation to how much control they actually had, but was related to how often the &quot;Score&quot; light lit up. Even when their choices made no difference at all, subjects confidently reported exerting some control over the lights.

===Observed behavior in games===
Ellen Langer&#x27;s research demonstrated that people were more likely to behave as if they could exercise control in a chance situation where &quot;skill cues&quot; were present. By skill cues, Langer meant properties of the situation more normally associated with the exercise of skill, in particular the exercise of choice, competition, familiarity with the stimulus and involvement in decisions. One simple form of this effect is found in casinos: when rolling dice in a craps game people tend to throw harder when they need high numbers and softer for low numbers.

In another experiment, subjects had to predict the outcome of thirty coin tosses. The feedback was rigged so that each subject was right exactly half the time, but the groups differed in where their &quot;hits&quot; occurred. Some were told that their early guesses were accurate. Others were told that their successes were distributed evenly through the thirty trials. Afterwards, they were surveyed about their performance. Subjects with early &quot;hits&quot; overestimated their total successes and had higher expectations of how they would perform on future guessing games. This result resembles the &quot;irrational primacy effect&quot; in which people give greater weight to information that occurs earlier in a series. Forty percent of the subjects believed their performance on this chance task would improve with practice, and twenty-five percent said that distraction would impair their performance.

Another of Langer&#x27;s experiments replicated by other researchers involves a lottery. Subjects are either given tickets at random or allowed to choose their own. They can then trade their tickets for others with a higher chance of paying out. Subjects who had chosen their own ticket were more reluctant to part with it. Tickets bearing familiar symbols were less likely to be exchanged than others with unfamiliar symbols. Although these lotteries were random, subjects behaved as though their choice of ticket affected the outcome. Participants who chose their own numbers were less likely to trade their ticket even for one in a game with better odds.

===Self reported behavior===
Yet another way to investigate perceptions of control is to ask people about hypothetical situations, for example their likelihood of being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in &quot;high-control&quot; situations, such as when they are driving, than in &quot;low-control&quot; situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver.

==Explanations==
Ellen Langer, who first demonstrated the illusion of control, explained her findings in terms of a confusion between skill and chance situations. She proposed that people base their judgments of control on &quot;skill cues&quot;. These are features of a situation that are usually associated with games of skill, such as competitiveness, familiarity and individual choice. When more of these skill cues are present, the illusion is stronger.

In 1998, Suzanne Thompson and colleagues argued that Langer&#x27;s explanation was inadequate to explain all the variations in the effect. As an alternative, they proposed that judgments about control are based on a procedure that they called the &quot;control heuristic&quot;. This theory proposes that judgments of control depend on two conditions; an intention to create the outcome, and a relationship between the action and outcome. In games of chance, these two conditions frequently go together. As well as an intention to win, there is an action, such as throwing a die or pulling a lever on a slot machine, which is immediately followed by an outcome. Even though the outcome is selected randomly, the control heuristic would result in the player feeling a degree of control over the outcome.

Self-regulation theory offers another explanation. To the extent that people are driven by internal goals concerned with the exercise of control over their environment, they will seek to reassert control in conditions of chaos, uncertainty or stress. One way of coping with a lack of real control is to falsely attribute oneself control of the situation.

The core self-evaluations (CSE) trait is a stable personality trait composed of locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. While those with high core self-evaluations are likely to believe that they control their own environment (i.e., internal locus of control), very high levels of CSE may lead to the illusion of control.

==Benefits and costs to the individual==

In 1988 Taylor and Brown have argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, are adaptive as they motivate people to persist at tasks when they might otherwise give up. This position is supported by Albert Bandura&#x27;s claim in 1989 that &quot;optimistic self-appraisals of capability, that are not unduly disparate from what is possible, can be advantageous, whereas veridical judgements can be self-limiting&quot;. His argument is essentially concerned with the adaptive effect of optimistic beliefs about control and performance in circumstances where control is possible, rather than perceived control in circumstances where outcomes do not depend on an individual&#x27;s behavior.

In 1997 Bandura also suggested that: 
&quot;In activities where the margins of error are narrow and missteps can produce costly or injurious consequences, personal well-being is best served by highly accurate efficacy appraisal.&quot;

Taylor and Brown argue that positive illusions are adaptive, since there is evidence that they are more common in normally mentally healthy individuals than in depressed individuals. However, in 1998 Pacini, Muir and Epstein showed that this may be because depressed people overcompensate for a tendency toward maladaptive intuitive processing by exercising excessive rational control in trivial situations, and note that the difference with non-depressed people disappears in more consequential circumstances.

There is also empirical evidence that high self-efficacy can be maladaptive in some circumstances. In a scenario-based study, Whyte et al. showed in 1997 that participants in whom they had induced high self-efficacy were significantly more likely to escalate commitment to a failing course of action. In 1998 Knee and Zuckerman challenged the definition of mental health used by Taylor and Brown and argue that lack of illusions is associated with a non-defensive personality oriented towards growth and learning and with low ego involvement in outcomes. They present evidence that self-determined individuals are less prone to these illusions.

In the late 1970s, Abramson and Alloy demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured illusion of control. This finding held true even when the depression was manipulated experimentally. However, when replicating the findings Msetfi et al. (2005, 2007) found that the overestimation of control in nondepressed people only showed up when the interval was long enough, implying that this is because they take more aspects of a situation into account than their depressed counterparts. Also, Dykman et al. (1989) showed that depressed people believe they have no control in situations where they actually do, so their perception is not more accurate overall. Allan et al. (2007) has proposed that the pessimistic bias of depressives resulted in &quot;depressive realism&quot; when asked about estimation of control, because depressed individuals are more likely to say no even if they have control.

A number of studies have found a link between a sense of control and health, especially in older people. This link for older people having improved health because of a sense of control was discussed in a study conducted in a nursing home. As the residents at the nursing home were encouraged to make more choices for themselves, there was more sense of control over their daily lives. This increase in control increased their overall happiness and health compared to those not making as many decisions for themselves. It was even speculated that with results so promising could slow down or reverse cognitive decline that may occur with aging. 

Fenton-O&#x27;Creevy et al. argue, as do Gollwittzer and Kinney in 1998, that while illusory beliefs about control may promote goal striving, they are not conducive to sound decision-making. Illusions of control may cause insensitivity to feedback, impede learning and predispose toward greater objective risk taking (since subjective risk will be reduced by illusion of control).

==Applications==
Psychologist Daniel Wegner argues that an illusion of control over external events underlies belief in psychokinesis, a supposed paranormal ability to move objects directly using the mind. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success.

A study published in 2003 examined traders working in the City of London&#x27;s investment banks. They each watched a graph being plotted on a computer screen, similar to a real-time graph of a stock price or index. Using three computer keys, they had to raise the value as high as possible. They were warned that the value showed random variations, but that the keys might have some effect. In fact, the fluctuations were not affected by the keys. The traders&#x27; ratings of their success measured their susceptibility to the illusion of control. This score was then compared with each trader&#x27;s performance. Those who were more prone to the illusion scored significantly lower on analysis, risk management and contribution to profits. They also earned significantly less.

<text>Sabalan or Savalan (native: ساوالان ) is an inactive stratovolcano in northwestern Iran located in Ardabil province.

At above sea level, it is the third-highest mountain in Iran. A permanent crater lake has formed at its summit. On one of its slopes around there are large rock formations of eroded volcanic outcrops that resemble animals, birds, and insects.
==Mount Savalan==
Located in the extreme northwest of Iran, Savalan is the country&#x27;s third-highest peak after Damavand and Alam-Kuh. It is also slightly higher than Mont Blanc in the Alps.

The mountain offers many attractions throughout the year. On the slopes of the mountain, the mineral water from springs attracts large numbers of tourists each year, many of whom have faith in healing properties attributed to the springs. The nomadic people of the area live in small villages, with their round &quot;Yurt&quot; tents appealing to tourists. Savalan has a ski resort (Alvares) and different tourist areas such as the Sarein spa. The mountain is known for its beautiful vistas, including the Shirvan gorge, where few climbers venture.

==Geology==
Sabalan is a large andesite stratovolcano in Meshgin Shahr, in Ardabil province in Iran. It is the second-highest volcano after Mount Damavand. The volcano is quite old. Its first eruptions occurred in the Eocene and later in the Miocene. But the main volcanism happened in the Pliocene and the Pleistocene as some of its rocks have been dated to 5–1.4  million years. Some references state that volcanic activity continued into the Holocene, less than 10,000  years ago.

The summit region has several peaks exceeding , primarily along a southwest–northeast trending ridge. The highest point is at the northeast end of the ridge and is separated from the + group of southwestern summits by a col.

The mountain is located in a continental climate with hot, dry summers and extremely cold, snowy winters. Precipitation falls primarily as snow in late autumn, winter, and spring, and is sufficient to sustain seven glaciers near the summit above . The largest of these were more than in length as of the 1970s. There are also extensive rock glaciers, several of which are more than in length.

==Climbing==
The climbing surface includes rocks of various size (Class 2 scrambling), and a moderate degree of fitness is required to climb it. The climb from the base camp starts easy, becomes challenging midway, then eases in gradient near the top. The lake on the top remains frozen except for about four weeks in late July to early August.

Some climbers start by driving to hot springs of Meshgin Shahr, where they start their climb. This climb takes about two days, reaching the base camp on the first day. Others take a taxi to base camp early in the morning and climb the mountain in one day. In 2006, there was talk of improving the road to the base camp. If this is done, a regular car should be able to make it to the base camp during the climbing season. The road goes through multiple nomadic encampments of shepherds.

One or two days of acclimatization in Tehran or Ardabil may be advisable. Mountaineering has been popular among the youth in Iran. On a Friday during the climbing season (late June to mid-August), one may find hundreds of people on the mountain. Guides can also be found in Ardabil. Adequate climbing equipment can be purchased in Ardabil or Tehran.

==Surrounding area==
The area around Sabalan, particularly near Meshkin, sarab city and ardabil city, produces large quantities of grain, including wheat. Due to the microclimate produced by the mountain, Ardabil remains pleasantly cool in the summers.

There are numerous hot springs around the slopes of Sabalan, with the main concentration within Sareyn County.

There are skiing slopes, with snow even in near-summer. A ski resort named &quot;Alvares&quot; is within an hour&#x27;s drive from Sareyn on the south ridge of Sabalan.

<text>This is a list English words of Polish origin, that is words used in the English language that were borrowed or derived, either directly or indirectly, from Polish. Several Polish words have entered English slang via Yiddish, brought by Ashkenazi Jews migrating from Poland to North America. Other English words were indirectly derived from Polish via Russian, French, German or Dutch. The Polish words themselves often come from other languages, such as German or Turkish. Borrowings from Polish tend to be mostly words referring to staples of Polish cuisine, names of Polish folk dances or specialist, e.g. horse-related, terminology. Among the words of Polish origin there are several words that derive from Polish geographic names and ethnonyms, including the name &quot;Polska&quot;, &quot;Poland&quot;, itself.

== Derived from common words ==
=== Directly ===
The following words are derive directly from Polish. Some of them are loanwords in Polish itself.

<doc id="549145" wikidata="Q830319" url="?curid=549145" title="Riga Radio and TV Tower">
<text>The Riga Radio and TV Tower () in Riga, Latvia is the tallest tower in the European Union. It was built between 1979 and 1989 with funding from the central government of the Soviet Union. Its highest point reaches , which makes it the third tallest tower in Europe (after the Ostankino Tower at and the Kyiv TV Tower at ) and the 15th tallest self-supporting tower in the world.

==Features==

There was a restaurant, &quot;Vēja roze&quot; (&quot;Wind Rose&quot;), at the level, which was open since the completion of the tower until 2006. There is a public observation platform just above it at , from which most of the city and surroundings and the Gulf of Riga can be seen.

===GLOW UP===
Since May 2019, the tower has closed to visitors for about five years for the renovation and expansion of the visitors&#x27; area and the adjacent territory under the TV Tower 2.0 project. It is planned to re-open in 2024 when there will again be a restaurant and the tower&#x27;s bomb shelter will open to the public. A 500 kg Foucault pendulum will also be installed. The estimated costs are €40-50 million.

==Construction==
The design chosen for the tower was that of Georgian architect Kims Nikurdze. Also credited are Nikolajs Sergijevskis and Viktors Savčenko. Construction materials included dolomite from Saaremaa, Karelian granite, and ironwork that had been prefabricated in Chelyabinsk. The assembly was done by the St Petersburg North-western Ironwork Assembly Trust.

The tower is built on an island called Zaķusala (English: Hare Island) in the middle of the River Daugava, and the base of the tower is located about above mean sea level. The tower is built to resist winds up to without any noticeable vibration with the help of three dampers installed at the level. Though seismic activity is rare, the tower was designed to withstand a magnitude 7.5 earthquake. The projected service life of the tower is 250 years.

===Bottom section===
The support section of the tower rises the first , comprising the three pillars that give the tower its unusual appearance, and a central building that contains offices and machine rooms. There are two high-speed sloping elevators, one in the north-east pillar and one in the south-west pillar, that ascend the bottom section in just 42 seconds. The third pillar contains a staircase. It is one of only three &quot;tall&quot; towers in the world that has 3 pillars; the others are the Avala Tower in Belgrade and Žižkov Television Tower in Prague.

===Middle section===
The middle section, at , contains equipment and a central elevator and is enclosed by panels of COR-TEN, an aluminum-iron alloy.

===Top section===
The top section, at , is a cylindrical structure which supports and contains the various antennas, and is topped by a flagpole. An elevator rises to the machine rooms at the level, and stairs ascend another .

==Operations==
The tower started broadcasting regularly in January 1986, though construction work continued until 1989.

The following television channels are broadcast from the tower:
*Latvian Television 1
*Latvian Television 7
*TV3
*RīgaTV 24
*DVB-T signal (experimental)

The following radio stations broadcast from the tower:

There is a DAB+ test on channel 12D.

Additionally, broadcast and two-way communications services are provided for various organizations and government agencies.

<text>A warehouse is a building for storing goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial parks on the outskirts of cities, towns, or villages.

Warehouses usually have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks. Sometimes warehouses are designed for the loading and unloading of goods directly from railways, airports, or seaports. They often have cranes and forklifts for moving goods, which are usually placed on ISO standard pallets and then loaded into pallet racks. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, spare parts, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing, and production.

In India and Hong Kong, a warehouse may be referred to as a godown. There are also godowns in the Shanghai Bund.

==Warehousing in the past==
===Prehistory and ancient history===
A warehouse can be defined functionally as a building in which to store bulk produce or goods (&quot;wares&quot;) for commercial purposes. The built form of warehouse structures throughout time depends on many contexts: materials, technologies, sites, and cultures.
In this sense, the warehouse postdates the need for communal or state-based mass storage of surplus food. Prehistoric civilizations relied on family- or community-owned storage pits, or &#x27;palace&#x27; storerooms, such as at Knossos, to protect surplus food. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew argued that gathering and storing agricultural surpluses in Bronze Age Minoan &#x27;palaces&#x27; was a critical ingredient in the formation of proto-state power.

The need for warehouses developed in societies in which trade reached a critical mass requiring storage at some point in the exchange process. This was highly evident in ancient Rome, where the horreum (pl. horrea) became a standard building form. The most studied examples are in Ostia, the port city that served Rome. The Horrea Galbae, a warehouse complex on the road towards Ostia, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. Galba&#x27;s horrea complex contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m2). As a point of reference, less than half of U.S. warehouses today are larger than 100,000 square feet (9290 m2).

===Medieval Europe===

The need for a warehouse implies having quantities of goods too big to be stored in a domestic storeroom. But as attested by legislation concerning the levy of duties, some medieval merchants across Europe commonly kept goods in their large household storerooms, often on the ground floor or cellars. An example is the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the substantial quarters of German traders in Venice, which combined a dwelling, warehouse, market and quarters for travellers.

From the Middle Ages on, dedicated warehouses were constructed around ports and other commercial hubs to facilitate large-scale trade. The warehouses of the trading port Bryggen in Bergen, Norway (now a World Heritage Site), demonstrate characteristic European gabled timber forms dating from the late Middle Ages, though what remains today was largely rebuilt in the same traditional style following great fires in 1702 and 1955.

===Industrial Revolution===
During the Industrial Revolution of the mid 18th century, the function of warehouses evolved and became more specialised. The mass production of goods launched by the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries fuelled the development of larger and more specialised warehouses, usually located close to transport hubs on canals, at railways and portside. Specialisation of tasks is characteristic of the factory system, which developed in British textile mills and potteries in the mid-late 1700s. Factory processes sped up work and deskilled labour, bringing new profits to capital investment.

Warehouses also fulfill a range of commercial functions besides simple storage, exemplified by Manchester&#x27;s cotton warehouses and Australian wool stores: receiving, stockpiling and despatching goods; displaying goods for commercial buyers; packing, checking and labelling orders, and dispatching them.

The utilitarian architecture of warehouses responded fast to emerging technologies. Before and into the nineteenth century, the basic European warehouse was built of load-bearing masonry walls or heavy-framed timber with a suitable external cladding. Inside, heavy timber posts supported timber beams and joists for the upper levels, rarely more than four to five stories high.
A gabled roof was conventional, with a gate in the gable facing the street, rail lines or port for a crane to hoist goods into the window-gates on each floor below. Convenient access for road transport was built-in via very large doors on the ground floor. If not in a separate building, office and display spaces were located on the ground or first floor.

Technological innovations of the early 19th century changed the shape of warehouses and the work performed inside them: cast iron columns and later, moulded steel posts; saw-tooth roofs; and steam power. All (except steel) were adopted quickly and were in common use by the middle of the 19th century.

Strong, slender cast iron columns began to replace masonry piers or timber posts to carry levels above the ground floor. As modern steel framing developed in the late 19th century, its strength and constructibility enabled the first skyscrapers. Steel girders replaced timber beams, increasing the span of internal bays in the warehouse.

The saw-tooth roof brought natural light to the top story of the warehouse. It transformed the shape of the warehouse, from the traditional peaked hip or gable to an essentially flat roof form that was often hidden behind a parapet. Warehouse buildings now became strongly horizontal. Inside the top floor, the vertical glazed pane of each saw-tooth enabled natural lighting over displayed goods, improving buyer inspection.

Hoists and cranes driven by steam power expanded the capacity of manual labour to lift and move heavy goods.

===20th century===
Two new power sources, hydraulics, and electricity, re-shaped warehouse design and practice at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century.

Public hydraulic power networks were constructed in many large industrial cities around the world in the 1870s-80s, exemplified by Manchester. They were highly effective to power cranes and lifts, whose application in warehouses served taller buildings and enabled new labour efficiencies.

Public electricity networks emerged in the 1890s. They were used at first mainly for lighting and soon to electrify lifts, making possible taller, more efficient warehouses. It took several decades for electrical power to be distributed widely throughout cities in the western world.

20th-century technologies made warehousing ever more efficient. Electricity became widely available and transformed lighting, security, lifting, and transport from the 1900s. The internal combustion engine, developed in the late 19th century, was installed in mass-produced vehicles from the 1910s. It not only reshaped transport methods but enabled many applications as a compact, portable power plant, wherever small engines were needed.

The forklift truck was invented in the early 20th century and came into wide use after World War II. Forklifts transformed the possibilities of multi-level pallet racking of goods in taller, single-level steel-framed buildings for higher storage density. The forklift, and its load fixed to a uniform pallet, enabled the rise of logistic approaches to storage in the later 20th century.

Always a building of function, in the late 20th century warehouses began to adapt to standardization, mechanization, technological innovation, and changes in supply chain methods. Here in the 21st century, we are currently witnessing the next major development in warehousing, automation.

== Warehouse layout ==
A good warehouse layout consist of 5 areas:

* Loading and unloading area - This is the area where goods are unloaded and loaded into the truck. It could be part of the building or separated from the building.
* Reception area - Also known as staging area, this a place where the incoming goods are processed and reviewed, and sorted before proceeding to storage.
* Storage area - This is the area of the warehouse where goods sit as it awaits dispatch. This area can be further subdivided into static storage for goods that will take longer before being dispatched and dynamic storage for goods that sell faster.
* Picking area - This is the area where goods being dispatched are prepared or modified before being shipped.
* Shipping area - Once goods have been prepared, they proceed to the packing or shipping area where they await the actual shipping.

==Typology==

Warehouses are generally considered industrial buildings and are usually located in industrial districts or zones (such as the outskirts of a city). LoopNet categorizes warehouses using the &quot;industrial&quot; property type. Craftsman Book Company&#x27;s 2018 National Building Cost Manual lists &quot;Warehouses&quot; under the &quot;Industrial Structures Section.&quot; In the UK, warehouses are classified under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as the industrial category &quot;B8 Storage and distribution&quot;.

Types of warehouses include storage warehouses, distribution centers (including fulfillment centers and truck terminals), retail warehouses, cold storage warehouses, and flex space.

According to Zendeq there are 13 types of warehouses:
# Public Warehouses
# Private Warehouses
# Government Warehouses
# Bonded Warehouses
# Distribution Centers
# Production/Manufacturing Warehouses
# Cross-Docking Warehouses
# Cooperative Warehouses
# Specialized Storage Warehouses
# Smart/Automated Warehouses
# Contract Warehouses
# Reverse Logistics Warehouses
# Consolidation Warehouses

=== Retail warehouses ===
These displayed goods for the home trade. This would be finished goods- such as the latest cotton blouses or fashion items. Their street frontage was impressive, so they took the styles of Italianate Palazzi. Warehouses are now more technologically oriented and help in linking stocks with the retail store in an accurate way.

Richard Cobden&#x27;s construction in Manchester&#x27;s Mosley Street was the first palazzo warehouse. There were already seven warehouses on Portland Street when S. &amp; J. Watts &amp; Co. commenced building the elaborate Watts Warehouse of 1855, but four more were opened before it was finished.

The Main Benefits of Retail Warehouse

* Safety and Preservation 
*Trouble-free handling
*Ensuring Continuous supply of products
*Easy access for small traders
*Location advantages 
*Employment Generation 
*Ease of financing

*Redevelopment of struggling urban areas, such as those where a local supermarket or a chain supermarket has gone out of business or left town. 
*Freestanding facilities offer dock doors, clear heights compatible with industrial use and ample parking.

Challenges of Retail Warehouse

* Tight profit margins 
*High customer expectation
*Operational Inefficiency 
*May have higher costs than initially thought.

=== Cool warehouses and cold storage ===

Cold storage preserves agricultural products. Refrigerated storage helps in eliminating sprouting, rotting and insect damage. Edible products are generally not stored for more than one year. Several perishable products require a storage temperature as low as −25 °C.

Cold storage helps stabilize market prices and evenly distribute goods both on demand and timely basis. The farmers get the opportunity of producing cash crops to get remunerative prices. The consumers get the supply of perishable commodities with lower fluctuation of prices.

Ammonia and Freon compressors are commonly used in cold storage warehouses to maintain the temperature. Ammonia refrigerant is cheaper, easily available, and has a high latent heat of evaporation, but it is also highly toxic and can form an explosive mixture when mixed with fuel oil. Insulation is also important, to reduce the loss of cold and to keep different sections of the warehouse at different temperatures.

There are two main types of refrigeration system used in cold storage warehouses: vapor absorption systems (VAS) and vapor-compression systems (VCS). VAS, although comparatively costlier to install, is more economical in operation.

The temperature necessary for preservation depends on the storage time required and the type of product. In general, there are three groups of products, foods that are alive (e.g. fruits and vegetables), foods that are no longer alive and have been processed in some form (e.g. meat and fish products), and commodities that benefit from storage at controlled temperature (e.g. beer, tobacco).

Location is important for the success of a cold storage facility. It should be in close proximity to a growing area as well as a market, be easily accessible for heavy vehicles, and have an uninterrupted power supply.

Plant attached cold storage is the preferred option for some manufacturers who want to keep their cold storage in house. Products can be transported via conveyor straight from manufacturing to a dedicated cold storage facility on-site.

=== Overseas warehouses ===
These catered for the overseas trade. They became the meeting places for overseas wholesale buyers where printed and plain could be discussed and ordered. Trade in cloth in Manchester was conducted by many nationalities.

Behrens Warehouse is on the corner of Oxford Street and Portland Street. It was built for Louis Behrens &amp; Son by P Nunn in 1860. It is a four-storey predominantly red brick build with 23 bays along Portland Street and 9 along Oxford Street. The Behrens family were prominent in banking and in the social life of the German Community in Manchester.
An Overseas warehouse refers to storage facilities located abroad. It plays a pivotal role in cross-border e-commerce trade, where local businesses transport goods en masse to desired market countries then establish a warehouse to store and distribute the goods in response to local sales demands. This process includes managing tasks such as sorting, packaging, and delivering straight from the local warehouse accordingly. Overseas warehouses can be principally divided into two types: Self-operated and Third-party public service warehouses.

Self-operated overseas warehouses are established and administered by the cross-border e-commerce enterprise. They only provide logistics services like warehousing and distribution for their own goods, implying that the entire logistics system of the cross-border e-commerce enterprise is self-controlled. 

On the other hand, a Third-party public service overseas warehouse is built and run by a separate logistics enterprise. There, they provide services including order sorting, multi-channel delivery, and subsequent transportation for multiple exporting e-commerce companies. This kind of warehouse broadly indicates that the entire e-commerce logistics system is under third-party control.

The fundamental business operations in overseas warehouses include the following:

1. Sellers send bulk products from their home country to an overseas warehouse where the staff undertakes inventory and shelving. When a buyer places an order, the seller sends delivery instructions to the warehouse system and local delivery is then executed based on those instructions.

2. In instances of issues with sellers&#x27; accounts or incorrect labels, goods need to be returned to the overseas warehouse for correction and re-sale.

3. A common transfer practice combines Amazon&#x27;s FBA service with third-party overseas warehouses, where goods are initially stored and then intermittently moved to FBA for replenishment, while concurrently shipping from overseas warehouses.

4. The warehouses also handle supplementary services such as product returns and exchanges.

By using an overseas warehouse, the delivery speed has certain advantages, which can improve the product price and increase gross profit to a certain extent. At the same time, it can also improve the consumer experience and stimulate the second consumption, so as to improve the overall sales.

=== Packing warehouses ===
&quot;Modern term: Fulfillment house&quot;

The main purpose of packing warehouses was the picking, checking, labelling and packing of goods for export. The packing warehouses: Asia House, India House and Velvet House along Whitworth Street in Manchester were some of the tallest buildings of their time. See List of packing houses. The more efficient the pick and pack process is, the faster items can be shipped to customers. Pick and pack warehousing is the process in which fulfillment centers choose products from shipments and re-package them for distribution. When shipments are received by the warehouse, items are stored and entered into an inventory management system for tracking and accountability. Picking refers to selecting the right quantities of products from warehouse storage. Packing, on the other hand, happens when those products are placed in shipping boxes with appropriate packaging materials, labeled, documented and shipped.

=== Railway warehouses ===
Warehouses were built close to the major stations in railway hubs. The first railway warehouse to be built was opposite the passenger platform at the terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. There was an important group of warehouses around London Road station (now Piccadilly station).In the 1890s the Great Northern Railway Company&#x27;s warehouse was completed on Deansgate: this was the last major railway warehouse to be built.

The London Warehouse Picadilly was one of four warehouses built by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in about 1865 to service the new London Road Station. It had its own branch to the Ashton Canal. This warehouse was built of brick with stone detailing. It had cast iron columns with wrought iron beams.

As part of its diversification activities, CWC developed a warehousing facility of Railway land along a Railway siding as a Pilot Project at Whitefield Goods Terminal at Bangalore after entering into an agreement with Indian Railway. This project started operation since February 2002 and resulted in attracting additional traffic to the Railways, improvement in customer service and an increase in the volumes of cargo handled by CWC. The success of this project led CWC to consider developing Railside Warehousing Complexes at other centers also throughout near identified Rail Terminals.

=== Canal warehouses ===

All these warehouse types can trace their origins back to the canal warehouses which were used for trans-shipment and storage. Castle field warehouses in Manchester are of this type and important as they were built at the terminus of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761. The Duke&#x27;s Warehouse in the Castle field Canal Basin in Manchester was the first canal warehouse to have the classic design features of internal canal arms, multi-storeys, split level loading, terracing and water powered hoists, and was built between 1769 and 1771. The Castle field terminus of the Bridgewater Canal has attracted a considerable amount of interest from historians since the 1860s, and from archaeologists since the 1960s. These studies have developed two themes; the complexity and success (or failure) of the water management systems built by James Brindley, and the physical development of the basin as a ware-house zones.

==Operations==

A customised storage building, a warehouse enables a business to stockpile goods, e.g., to build up a full load prior to transport, or hold unloaded goods before further distribution, or store goods like wine and cheese that require maturation. As a place for storage, the warehouse has to be secure, convenient, and as spacious as possible, according to the owner&#x27;s resources, the site and contemporary building technology.  Before mechanised technology developed, warehouse functions relied on human labor, using mechanical lifting aids like pulley systems.

Breaking it down, warehouse operations covers a number of important areas, from the receiving, organization, fulfillment, and distribution processes. These areas include:

* Receiving of goods
* Cross-docking of goods
* Organizing and storing inventory
* Attaching asset tracking solutions (like barcodes) to assets and inventory
* Integrating and maintaining a tracking software, like a warehouse management system
* Overseeing the integration of new technology
* Selecting picking routes
* Establishing sorting and packing practices
* Maintaining the warehouse facility
* Developing racking designs and warehouse infrastructure.

===Storage and shipping systems===
Some of the most common warehouse storage systems are:
* Pallet racking including selective, drive-in, drive-thru, double-deep, pushback, and gravity flow
* Cantilever racking uses arms, rather than pallets, to store long thin objects like timber.
* Mezzanine adds a semi-permanent story of storage within a warehouse

* Vertical Lift Modules are packed systems with vertically arranged trays stored on both sides of the unit.
* Horizontal Carousels consist of a frame and a rotating carriage of bins.
* Vertical Carousels consisting of a series of carriers mounted on a vertical closed-loop track, inside a metal enclosure.
* highbay an automated racking system with out feeds that are manually emptied by forklift or other mhe. invented by ben berry and still maintained and improved by him.

A &quot;piece pick&quot; is a type of order selection process where a product is picked and handled in individual units and placed in an outer carton, tote or another container before shipping. Catalog companies and internet retailers are examples of predominantly piece-pick operations. Their customers rarely order in pallet or case quantities; instead, they typically order just one or two pieces of one or two items. Several elements make up the piece-pick system. They include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology used. Every movement inside a warehouse must be accompanied by a work order. Warehouse operation can fail when workers move goods without work orders, or when a storage position is left unregistered in the system.

One of the most important factors to be considered while designing a warehouse storage plan is the Product Volume. The Products which has high demand and the ones that has to reach the customer or the next workstation in a short span of time has to be kept in places like low storage racks or even near primary aisles, which greatly minimizes the distance to be moved and thus the time consumed. Opposingly, the less frequent moved products can be placed somewhere distant from the primary aisles or even the higher storage racks.

Material direction and tracking in a warehouse can be coordinated by a Warehouse Management System (WMS), a database driven computer program. The development of work procedures goes hard in hand with training warehouse personnel. Most firms implement a WMS to standardize work procedure and encourage best practice. These systems facilitate management in their daily planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling the utilization of available resources, to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse, while supporting staff in the performance of material movement and storage in and around a warehouse. Logistics personnel use the WMS to improve warehouse efficiency by directing pathways and to maintain accurate inventory by recording warehouse transactions.

===Automation and optimization===
Some warehouses are completely automated, and require only operators to work and handle all the task. Pallets and product move on a system of automated conveyors, cranes and automated storage and retrieval systems coordinated by programmable logic controllers and computers running logistics automation software. These systems are often installed in refrigerated warehouses where temperatures are kept very cold to keep the product from spoiling. This is especially true in electronics warehouses that require specific temperatures to avoid damaging parts. Automation is also common where land is expensive, as automated storage systems can use vertical space efficiently. These high-bay storage areas are often more than 10 meters (33 feet) high, with some over 20 meters (65 feet) high. Automated storage systems can be built up to 40m high.

For a warehouse to function efficiently, the facility must be properly &quot;slotted&quot;. Slotting addresses which storage medium a product is picked from (pallet rack or carton flow), where each item is placed for storage, and how items are picked (pick-to-light, pick-to-voice, or pick-to-paper). With a proper slotting plan, a warehouse can ensure that fast moving items are stored in the most accessible areas or closest to dock areas, improve its inventory rotation requirements, such as first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO) systems, control labor costs and increase productivity.

Pallet racks are commonly used to organize a warehouse. It is important to know the dimensions of racking and the number of bays needed as well as the dimensions of the product to be stored. Clearance should be accounted for if using a forklift or pallet mover to move inventory.

To help speed up the receiving of goods, Radio-frequency identification (RFID) portals have been installed at the doors of the warehouses for instant verification of product information like the SKUs and their quantities. RFID technology also ensures precise inventory management and easy goods and equipment tracking.

===Costs===
An article by Thomas W. Speh published around 1990 and considered significant by the Warehousing Forum stated that a costing system for warehousing should take account of the space allocated for storage per period of time, and the time taken for handling materials as they are admitted to or discharged from the warehouse. Speh advises businesses on the factors to be taken into account in building up a &quot;handling price&quot; and a &quot;storage price&quot;, which will enable an operator to make a profit and take account of risks such as unused space, at the same time as managing buyers&#x27; expectations of a fair price.

===Recent trends===

Modern warehouses commonly use a system of wide aisle pallet racking to store goods which can be loaded and unloaded using forklift trucks.

Traditional warehousing has declined since the last decades of the 20th century, with the gradual introduction of Just In Time (JIT) techniques. The JIT system promotes product delivery directly from suppliers to consumer without the use of warehouses. However, with the gradual implementation of offshore outsourcing and offshoring in about the same time period, the distance between the manufacturer and the retailer (or the parts manufacturer and the industrial plant) grew considerably in many domains, necessitating at least one warehouse per country or per region in any typical supply chain for a given range of products.

Recent retailing trends have led to the development of warehouse-style retail stores. These high-ceiling buildings display retail goods on tall, heavy-duty industrial racks rather than conventional retail shelving. Typically, items ready for sale are on the bottom of the racks, and crated or palletized inventory is in the upper rack. Essentially, the same building serves as both a warehouse and retail store.

Another trend relates to vendor-managed inventory (VMI). This gives the vendor the control to maintain the level of stock in the store. This method has its own issue that the vendor gains access to the warehouse.

==Education ==
There are several non-profit organizations which are focused on imparting knowledge, education and research in the field of warehouse management and its role in the supply chain industry. The Warehousing Education and Research Council (WERC) and International Warehouse Logistics Association (IWLA) in Illinois, United States. They provide professional certification and continuing education programs for the industry in the country. The Australian College of Training have government funded programs to provide personal development and continuation training in warehousing certs II – V (Diploma), they operate in Western Australia online and face to face, or Australia wide for online only courses.

== Safety ==
Warehousing has unique health and safety challenges and has been recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.

Creating a safe and productive warehouse setting starts with a culture of safety. This culture should be reinforced by the managers at all levels, especially executives and owners.

Creating a safe working environment begins with a safety plan that covers all parts of the warehouse and applies to all employees. Owners and managers should expect to put resources of time and money toward safety and willingly build these costs into the overall budget.

Regular training and inspections should be done to ensure that all employees are knowledgeable in fire safety processes and that all fire safety measures are in place and functioning as required.

<doc id="549148" wikidata="Q513768" url="?curid=549148" title="Max Miller (comedian)">
<text>Thomas Henry Sargent (21 November 1894 – 7 May 1963), known professionally by his stage name Max Miller and billed as The Cheeky Chappie, was an English comedian often considered the greatest stand-up of his generation. He came from humble beginnings and left school at the age of twelve. At the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for the army. During his time in the forces, he started a troupe concert party. On leaving the army, he took up work as a light comedian, dancer, and singer. He toured extensively, appearing in variety, revues and by the early 1930s reached the top of the bill in the large music halls including the London Palladium.

He recorded many songs, some of which he wrote. He appeared frequently on radio and starred in fourteen feature films. He was known for his flamboyant suits, his wicked charm, and his risqué jokes often led to difficulties with the censors. He made his last recording in January 1963 and died four months later.

==Early years==
Miller was born as Thomas Henry Sargent on 21 November 1894 in Hereford Street, Kemptown, Brighton, Sussex. He was the second child of James Sargent, a labourer, and Alice (née West), a flower seller; Miller had three brothers and two sisters. His parents were poor and often unable to pay rent, so were forced to move to other parts of the town. Owing to this, Miller frequently changed schools, until he reached 12 when he left altogether. He tried jobs such as labouring, delivering milk, selling fish and chips, caddying at the Brighton and Hove Golf Course, and finally trained to be a motor mechanic. As a youth, he was nicknamed &quot;Swanky Sargent&quot;.

On the outbreak of the war in 1914, Miller volunteered for the army. He joined the Royal Sussex Regiment and, after serving in France, was posted to India and a year later to Mesopotamia, where he was temporarily blinded for three days. This experience stayed with him all his life, and in later years he did much work to help the blind including giving his home in Brighton over to St Dunstans during World War 2. During his time in the army, he started a troops&#x27; concert party.

==Career==
===Early performing experiences===

Demobilised from the army, Miller found work to be in short supply, and he had lost his mother to the 1918 flu pandemic. He had his sights on performing in London, and obtained a booking at the Shoreditch Hall in 1919. He was not experienced enough for the type of venue, however, and lasted only a week. Returning to Brighton, he saw an advertisement for artists to join Jack Sheppard&#x27;s concert party in an alfresco theatre on Brighton beach. He applied and joined as a light comedian for the 1919 summer season. While with the concert party, he met his future wife, Frances Kathleen Marsh, who was a contralto in the group.

Kathleen Marsh came from a middle-class family whose parents came to Brighton from Dorset shortly before she was born in 1896. Her elder brother Ernest Marsh served as a Brighton alderman for 43 years and became mayor of the then town from 1949 to 1950.

In the summer of 1920, Harry toured nationwide in &quot;The Rogues&quot;, a concert party. The following year, Harry and Kathleen toured in a revue called &quot;The Girl&quot;. While in Plymouth, the couple married at the parish church in Tormoham, Devon on 17 February 1921. (Tormoham is better known today as Torre in the seaside resort of Torquay.) As well as being a performer, Kathleen was an astute businesswoman, and thereafter did much to develop her husband&#x27;s career. She suggested that he should change his name to Max Miller. Later, a press notice described Max as the Cheeky Chappie, and the nickname stuck.

Max and Kathleen formed a double act for a while, but it became obvious to her that Max was the stronger performer and that he would be better as a solo act.

===Apprenticeship===

Through the 1920s, Miller was regularly touring in revues. In 1922 he was in a show presented by the Sydney Syndicate, &quot;There You Are Then&quot;. The following year, he toured with the Ernest Binn Arcadians. 1924 saw him joining a revue called &quot;Crisps&quot;. However, during that summer, he returned to Jack Sheppard&#x27;s Concert Party on the Brighton seafront. In 1925, he continued in the revue &quot;Crisps&quot;, and in November that year joined the cast of &quot;Ten to One On&quot;, which starred Jimmy James. This show ran until February 1926, when Miller gained work in variety or cine-variety, the latter a show consisting half of film and half of live acts. In September, he was booked in the Holborn Empire, his first engagement there, where he was spotted by impresario Tom Arnold, who booked him to star in his next revue, &quot;Piccadilly&quot;. It opened in Birmingham and toured the country. His co-star was the 21-year-old Florence Desmond. After that, he was booked by Fred Karno to appear in &quot;The Show&quot;, and in May joined a touring cabaret revue called &quot;XYZ&quot; until the end of the year. After a few weeks in variety, he was back in revue, starring in Francis Laider&#x27;s &quot;Tipperary Tim&quot;.

This kept him busy until February 1929, when he appointed a new agent, Julius Darewski. This was a turning point in his career. In May, Miller made his first appearance at the London Palladium in variety. He returned there in October and, in November, joined the cast of &quot;Fools in Paradise&quot;, which took him to March 1930. This would be his last revue for some time.

Miller much preferred to perform solo, and from 1930 onwards, he appeared in variety in large theatres, including the London Palladium and the Holborn Empire. In those days, instant success was unheard of, and Miller, like any other performer, had to earn his fame through a long apprenticeship. In May 1931, he appeared in his first Royal Variety Performance. Radio broadcasts followed.

In 1932, he made his first recording, &quot;Confessions of a Cheeky Chappie&quot;, on the Broadcast Twelve Records label. After this initial success, he was wooed by His Master&#x27;s Voice and recorded for them. In 1953, he changed to Philips, and then to Pye.

Miller was given a cameo role in the film &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1933) in the part of a music publisher selling a song to a pianist, played by John Gielgud. Although he was not credited for his role, his three-minute debut was impressive, got him noticed and led to his making a further 13 films working up from small parts to starring roles. Considered his best film, &quot;Educated Evans&quot; (1936), which was based on an Edgar Wallace story and filmed by Warner Bros., it has been lost. His last but one film was &quot;Hoots Mon!&quot; (1940). He played the part of a southern English comedian called Harry Hawkins. In the film there is a scene in which Harry Hawkins appears on the stage in a variety theatre. The act is Miller&#x27;s, and the sequence is the only one in existence giving us an idea of his stage act. It is invariably included in any documentary made about him.

===Stardom===
Miller&#x27;s act on a variety bill usually lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. It would begin with the orchestra playing his signature tune, &quot;Mary from the Dairy&quot;. A spotlight aimed on the curtain by the wings would anticipate his appearance. There would be excitement in the audience; he would sometimes wait for up to ten seconds until he appeared, leading to resounding applause. Miller would walk to the microphone and just stand there in his costume, a colourful suit with plus-fours, a kipper tie, trilby and co-respondent shoes, and wait for the laughter to begin.

Although Miller&#x27;s material was risqué, he never swore on stage and disapproved of those who did. He used double entendre, and when telling a joke would often leave out the last word or words for the audience to complete.

His act would be punctuated by songs: sentimental material like &quot;My Old Mum&quot;, or comic numbers such as &quot;Twin Sisters&quot;. Sometimes he would accompany himself on guitar or entertain with a soft shoe shuffle. He wrote and co-wrote a number of songs.

Miller was very much a southern English comedian. He preferred being booked in theatres in London or the south, so he could return to his beloved Brighton after a show. However, in 1932 he embarked on his only overseas tour, when he sailed to Cape Town to appear in Johannesburg and Pretoria, South Africa.

After many years as a solo act in variety, he appeared in George Black&#x27;s wartime revue &quot;Haw Haw!&quot; at the Holborn Empire from December 1939 to July 1940. George Black&#x27;s next revue, &quot;Apple Sauce&quot;, opened in August 1940 at the Holborn Empire, co-starring Vera Lynn. After the theatre was bombed, the show transferred to the London Palladium, where it ran until November 1941. After that, Miller was back touring in variety, and broke all records as the highest paid variety artist, earning £1,025 in a single week at the Coventry Hippodrome in February, 1943.

In 1947, he topped the bill in &quot;Bernard Delfont presents International Variety&quot; at the London Casino. In his review of the show, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; theatre critic Lionel Hale described Miller as the &quot;gold of the music hall&quot;.

===The comeback===

Miller appeared in three Royal Variety Performances (1931, 1937 and 1950). In the last of these, he was annoyed that he was only given six minutes, while the American comedian Jack Benny got twenty minutes, so he abandoned his script and went on for twelve minutes, ending with riotous applause. However, this had a devastating effect on the schedule. Val Parnell, the producer, who ran the Moss Empires circuit of theatres, was furious, and told Miller that he would never work for him again.

Despite this, after eighteen months of Miller&#x27;s touring in secondary theatres, he was invited back to the &quot;number ones&quot; – the Moss Empires – and returned in triumph to the London Palladium. One of these &quot;number two&quot; theatres was Hulme Hippodrome, where Ken Dodd said he appeared as a younger performer on the same bill as Max Miller in &quot;about 1951, 1952&quot;. This return to the Palladium revitalised his career, and with it came a new recording contract, this time with Philips. He was back on radio and appeared on television, but his television appearances were never a great success. The new medium did not suit his style; he needed the feedback only a live theatre audience could give him and the freedom to use his naughty material.

Miller appeared regularly in all the large variety halls in and around London: the Hackney Empire, Chelsea Palace, Chiswick Empire, Finsbury Park Empire, Wood Green Empire and Metropolitan Music Hall. It was in the latter that he recorded the LP &quot;Max at the Met&quot; in 1957.

===The final years===


In 1958, Miller suffered a heart attack. After recovery, he needed to take life easier. His last West End appearance took place at the Palace Theatre in April 1959, and his last ever appearance in variety was in Folkestone in December 1960. Miller continued to make records, his last being in January 1963 with Lonnie Donegan.

===Death===
Miller died at home on 7 May 1963, aged 68, and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium, Brighton. A memorial tablet is mounted on a wall in the Garden of Remembrance. His wife Kathleen outlived him by nine years, dying in a Hove nursing home in 1972.

With dwindling work in variety, brought about by the rise of television, he had commented, &quot;When I&#x27;m dead and gone, the game&#x27;s finished.&quot;

It has frequently been suggested that John Osborne modelled the character Archie Rice in his play &quot;The Entertainer&quot; on Miller. John Osborne denied it and in his autobiography he wrote, &quot;This is not so. Archie was a man. Max was a god, a saloon-bar Priapus&quot;.

==Censorship==
The laws on censorship were strict during Miller&#x27;s lifetime. Those responsible for censorship were the Lord Chamberlain in London and local watch committees in the regions. Miller&#x27;s material needed approval by those bodies but by using innuendo, leaving out the last word or words of a joke, he could get away with much risqué and saucy material. However, he never swore or told a &quot;dirty joke&quot; on stage.

In one of his acts he would take from his pocket two books, one a white book and the other a blue book, explaining to the audience that these are joke books and asking them which the audience would like; the crowd almost always chose the blue book. The jokes in the blue book were the naughty ones. For example:
I went skating the other week with a young lady on ice and we&#x27;d been going around for quite a while and she kept on falling down.I said, &quot;Have you hurt yourself?”She said, &quot;No, I&#x27;m sorry to spoil your fun&quot;.I said, &quot;You&#x27;re not spoiling my fun. It&#x27;ll keep on ice&quot;.

Or he would leave the last word out for the audience to finish and blamed them if they laughed.
When roses are red,They&#x27;re ready for plucking.When a girl is sixteen,She&#x27;s ready for ... &#x27;Ere 

He would then say, &quot;I know exactly what you are saying to yourself, you&#x27;re wrong, I know what you&#x27;re saying. You wicked lot. You&#x27;re the sort of people that get me a bad name!&quot;

It was said that Miller was banned by the BBC twice, first in the 1930s, and then in the 1950s. However, these rumours only helped Miller&#x27;s reputation as daring and naughty, and led to increased box office sales.

==Legacy==

Miller influenced many comedians during his lifetime and since. His jokes live on and are often told by other comedians. The comedian Walter William Bygraves became known as Max Bygraves after his impersonation of Miller. Miller was one of the many famous people on the cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

The biography, &quot;Max Miller the Cheeky Chappie&quot; by John M. East was published in 1977. A paperback version was issued in 1993 with additional material. Two paperbacks containing Miller&#x27;s jokes have been published: &quot;The Max Miller Blue Book&quot; compiled by Barry Took and illustrated by cartoonist Trog (1975) and &quot;The Max Miller Appreciation Society&#x27;s Blue Book&quot; compiled by members with a foreword by Roy Hudd (2001).

Several radio and television documentaries have been produced including Gerald Scarfe&#x27;s &quot;The Girls Who Do&quot; (&quot;40 Minutes&quot;, BBC, 1989) and &quot;Heroes of Comedy: Max Miller&quot; (1995). &quot;Here&#x27;s a Funny Thing&quot;, a play featuring John Bardon by R.W. Shakespeare, was staged at the Edinburgh Fringe, and at the Fortune Theatre in London; it was broadcast on Channel Four in November 1982.

In 1999, the Max Miller Appreciation Society was formed in Brighton. Its main purpose is to keep his memory alive. It has erected a bronze statue sculptured by Peter Webster in the Royal Pavilion Gardens, New Road, Brighton (unveiled 1 May 2005; re-sited August 2007) and mounted two blue plaques on his former homes on Ashcroft in Kingston Lane, Shoreham-by-Sea (2000) and at 160 Marine Parade, Brighton (2006). In 2009, the Society curated an exhibition devoted to Miller&#x27;s life and career in Bardsley&#x27;s Fish Restaurant, Baker Street, Brighton.

In the British drama &quot;The Triple Echo&quot; from 1972, set during World War II, Glenda Jackson and Brian Deacon are listening to him (and laughing aloud) on the radio. He&#x27;s telling a story about finding a man without any clothes on, standing in his house, and his wife said he&#x27;s a nudist who came to use the phone.

==Catchphrases==

&quot;He was renowned for his use of catchphrases, in performance&quot;
*&quot;Now, there&#x27;s a funny thing&quot;
*&quot;Listen! Listen!&quot;
*&quot;There&#x27;ll never be another&quot;
*&quot;They don&#x27;t make &#x27;em anymore, duck!&quot;
*&quot;It&#x27;s people like you who give me a bad name&quot;
*&quot;It&#x27;s all clever stuff, no rubbish!&quot;
*&quot;How&#x27;s your memory, gal?&quot;
*&quot;Miller&#x27;s the name, Lady&quot;
*&quot;I don&#x27;t care what I say, do I?&quot;
*&quot;That&#x27;s nice, Maxie&quot;
*&quot;You can&#x27;t help liking him&quot;
*&quot; &#x27;Ere!&quot;

<text>Thomas Edwin Mix (born Thomas Hezikiah Mix; January 6, 1880 – October 12, 1940) was an American film actor and the star of many early Western films between 1909 and 1935. He appeared in 291 films, all but nine of which were silent films. He was one of Hollywood&#x27;s first Western stars and helped define the genre as it emerged in the early days of the cinema.

== Early years ==
Thomas Hezikiah Mix was born January 6, 1880, in Mix Run, Pennsylvania, approximately north of State College, to Edwin Elias Mix and Elizabeth Heistand. He grew up in nearby DuBois, where his father, a stable master for a wealthy lumber merchant, taught him to ride and love horses. He spent time working on a local farm owned by John DuBois, a lumber businessman.

In April 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Mix enlisted in the Army under the name Thomas E. (Edwin) Mix. His unit never went overseas, and Mix later failed to return for duty after an extended furlough when he married Grace I. Allin on July 18, 1902. Mix was listed as AWOL on November 4, 1902, but was never court-martialed. His marriage to Allin was annulled after one year. In 1905, Mix married Kitty Jewel Perinne, and this marriage also ended within a year. He next married Olive Stokes on January 10, 1909, in Medora, North Dakota. On July 13, 1912, Olive gave birth to their daughter Ruth.

In 1905, Mix rode in President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s inaugural parade with a group of 50 horsemen led by Seth Bullock, which included several former Rough Riders. Years later, Hollywood publicists muddled this event to imply that Mix had been a Rough Rider himself.

Mix went to Oklahoma and lived in Guthrie, working as a bartender and other odd jobs. He was briefly night marshal of Dewey, in 1911. He worked at the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch, one of the largest ranching businesses in the United States, covering , hence its name. The ranch had its own touring Wild West show in which Mix appeared. He stood out as a skilled horseman and expert shot, winning national riding and roping contests at Prescott, Arizona, in 1909, and Canon City, Colorado, in 1910.

Mix was a Freemason.

== Film career ==

=== Selig Polyscope ===

Mix began his film career as a supporting cast member with the Selig Polyscope Company. His first appearance was in a short film, &quot;The Cowboy Millionaire&quot;, released on October 21, 1909. In 1910, he appeared as himself in a short documentary film, &quot;Ranch Life in the Great Southwest&quot;, in which he displayed his skills as a cattle wrangler. Shot in Dewey, Oklahoma with Selig studio cameramen, the film was a success, and Mix became an early motion picture star.

Mix performed in more than 100 films for Selig, many of which were filmed in Las Vegas, New Mexico. While with Selig he co-starred in several films with Victoria Forde, and they fell in love. He divorced Olive Stokes in 1917. By then, Selig Polyscope had encountered severe financial difficulties, and Mix and Forde both subsequently signed with Fox Film Corporation, which had leased the Edendale studio. They married in 1918 and had a daughter, Thomasina (Tommie) Mix, in February 1922. As a result of Mix&#x27;s schedule of making six to ten movies per year, and his refusal to let her visit him while he was working, they lived apart during much of their marriage. However, she would often promote his films.

===Transfer to Fox and Mixville ===
Soon after his departure from Selig in 1917, Mix opted to work for the Fox Film Corporation. Fox head William Fox, who liked that Mix did his own stunts, would quickly sign him. Initially paid $350 a week by Fox, Mix&#x27;s transition to the studio soon proved successful, with the studio&#x27;s solid financial footing playing to a much wider audience than his Selig movies could get. According the Dewey, Oklahoma-based &quot;Tom Mix Museum&quot;, &quot;The wider exposure afforded by Fox undoubtedly contributed to Tom&#x27;s move from a simply prolific actor to genuine world famous movie star.&quot; 

Mix made more than 160 cowboy films throughout the 1920s. These featured action-oriented scripts contrasted with the documentary style of his work with Selig. Heroes and villains were sharply defined and a clean-cut cowboy always saved the day. Millions of American children grew up watching his films on Saturday afternoons. His horse, &quot;Tony the Wonder Horse&quot;, also became a celebrity. Mix did his own stunts and was frequently injured.

In 1913, Mix moved his family to a ranch he purchased in Prescott named Bar Circle A Ranch. Some of his movies were filmed in his Prescott home. During this time, Mix had success in the local Prescott Frontier Days rodeo, which claims to be the &quot;world&#x27;s oldest rodeo&quot;. In 1920, he took first prize in a bull-riding contest. The Bar Circle A Ranch has been developed into a planned community called Yavapai Hills, where there is a street named Bar Circle A Road.

Mix&#x27;s salary at Fox reached $7,500 a week. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons wrote that he had his initials in electric lights on the top of his house. Eventually, his salary at Fox would reach $17,500 a week. His performances were realistic with action stunts, horseback riding, attention-grabbing cowboy costumes, and showmanship. At the Edendale lot, Mix built a shooting set called Mixville. Loaded with western props and furnishings, it has been described as a &quot;complete frontier town, with a dusty street, hitching rails, a saloon, jail, bank, doctor&#x27;s office, surveyor&#x27;s office, and the simple frame houses typical of the early Western era&quot;. Near the back of the lot an Indian village of lodges was ringed by miniature plaster mountains. The set also included a simulated desert, a large corral, and (to facilitate interior shots) a ranch house with no roof. 

Despite his successful film career, Mix opted to return to performing for the 101 Wild West Show by the mid-1920 when he wasn&#x27;t making films for Fox. By 1927, low budget imitations of Mix&#x27;s film spread, which led to Fox further losing interest in keeping him. In addition, Fox grew weary of using high budgets for Mix&#x27;s films and paying him high salaries and wanted to instead focus more on transitioning to sound films. Mix would part ways with Fox in 1928. Following his departure from Fox, Mix did a vaudeville tour with the Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuit. Mix threatened to move to Argentina to make films or to join the circus, but agreed to return to Hollywood in July 1928 and signed with FBO. However, he only made five films with FBO and soon left after salary disputes with FBO studio head Joseph P. Kennedy. He called Kennedy, who had also acquired a controlling stake in Keith-Albee-Orpheum shortly before Mix joined FBO, a &quot;tight-assed, money-crazy son of a bitch&quot;; Kennedy would only pay Mix just over half of what he made at while at Fox. 
Mix became friends with Wyatt Earp, who lived in Los Angeles and occasionally visited Hollywood western movie sets. He was a pallbearer at Earp&#x27;s funeral in January 1929. The newspapers reported that Mix cried during his friend&#x27;s service.

By 1929, Mix was past his prime and undergoing marriage difficulties, with his fourth wife Victoria, who was already very good at spending his money, taking their daughter Thomasina for an extended European vacation where she proceeded to spend money as if Tom were bringing it in as fast as ever, which was not the case. Shortly after signing with the Sells Floto Circus, Mix was charged with tax evasion for the year 1925-1927. Despite the fact that there was never any evidence to indicate that Mix was the instigator, or even aware, of the faulty filings, Mix nevertheless signed the forms, which had been prepared by his accountant, and eventually paid a hefty fine. This incident would tarnish his good guy image. By the end of 1929, Mix, whose big salaries as an entertainer also led to him being one of the biggest spenders in the entertainment industry, would lose not only lose the great majority of his fortune, but also his Arizona ranch and his Hollywood mansion in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash.

=== 1930s ===
Mix appeared with the Sells-Floto Circus in 1929, 1930, and 1931 at a reported weekly salary of $20,000 (). Meanwhile, the Great Depression (along with the actor&#x27;s continuous free-spending ways and many wives) reportedly wiped out most of his savings. 

Mix and Forde divorced in 1931, and in 1932, he married his fifth wife, Mabel Hubbell Ward. 

Universal Pictures approached him in 1932 with an offer to perform in &quot;talkies,&quot; which included script and cast approval. He acted in nine films for Universal, all of which were his only sound films, but because of injuries he received while filming, he was reluctant to do any more.

Around 1933, Mix appeared with the Sam B. Dill circus, which he reportedly bought two years later (in 1935).

Mix&#x27;s last screen appearance was a 15-episode sound Mascot Pictures serial, &quot;The Miracle Rider&quot; (1935), for which he received $40,000 for the four weeks of filming. Outdoor action sequences for the production were filmed primarily on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The site was known for its huge sandstone boulders, and one of them later became known as &quot;Tom Mix Rock&quot; when it was discovered it had been used in &quot;The Miracle Rider&quot;. In one episode, Mix was filmed descending from the top of the rock, with boot holes carved into it to assist him in making the descent. The rock and the boot holes, although unmarked, is in the Garden of the Gods park in Chatsworth.

Also in 1935, Texas governor James V. Allred named Mix an honorary Texas Ranger. 

Mix returned to circus performing, working with his eldest daughter Ruth Jane Mix, who had also appeared in some of his films. In 1938, he went to Europe on a promotional trip, leaving Ruth behind to manage the circus. Without him, however, the circus soon failed, and he later excluded her from his will. 

Mix had reportedly made over $6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) during his 26-year film career, but nevertheless would have much of this fortune vanish due to, in large part, the 1929 stock market crash and the excessive amount of spending undertaken by him and his fourth wife.

== Radio ==

In 1933, Ralston Purina obtained his permission to produce the radio series &quot;Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters&quot;, which, but for one year during World War II, was popular throughout most of the 1930s through the early 1950s, well after Mix&#x27;s death. Mix never appeared on these broadcasts (his voice, damaged by a bullet to the throat and repeated broken noses, was not fit for radio) and was instead played by radio actors: Artells Dickson (early 1930s), Jack Holden (from 1937), Russell Thorsen (early 1940s) and Joe &quot;Curley&quot; Bradley (from 1944). Others in the supporting cast included George Gobel, Harold Peary and Willard Waterman.

The Ralston company offered ads during the radio program for listeners to send in for a series of 12 special Ralston–Tom Mix comic books available only by writing the Ralston Company by mail.

Most of Mix&#x27;s radio work has been lost over the years; recordings of only approximately 30 scattered episodes, and no complete story arcs, survive.

== Death ==

On October 12, 1940, after visiting Pima County Sheriff Ed Echols in Tucson, Arizona, Mix was killed when his car overturned while he was taking a detour south of Florence, Arizona. He was 60 years old.

His funeral took place at the Little Church of the Flowers in Glendale, California, on October 16, 1940, and was attended by thousands of people. He is buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

A small stone memorial marks the site of his death on State Route 79, and the nearby gully is known as &quot;Tom Mix Wash&quot;. The marker bears the inscription: &quot;In memory of Tom Mix, whose spirit left his body on this spot and whose characterization and portrayals in life served to better fix memories of the old West in the minds of living men.&quot;

With his death, a judge gave away many of Mix&#x27;s personal belongings to a neighbor.

== Legacy ==
Tom Mix was the acknowledged &quot;King of Cowboys&quot; when Ronald Reagan and John Wayne were young, and the influence of his screen persona can be seen in their approach to portraying cowboys. When an injury caused football player Marion Morrison (later known as John Wayne) to drop out of the University of Southern California, Mix helped him find work moving props in the back lot of Fox Studios. That was the beginning of Wayne&#x27;s Hollywood career.

Mix made 291 movies throughout his career. As of 2007, only about 10% of these were known to be available for viewing, though it is unclear how many are now considered lost films. The 1937 Fox vault fire lost most of the archive of his films made with Fox.
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Mix has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street. His cowboy boot prints, palm prints and the hoof prints of his horse, Tony, are at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1958 Mix was inducted posthumously into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1959, a &quot;Monument to the Stars&quot; was erected on Beverly Drive (where it intersects Olympic Boulevard and becomes Beverwil) in Beverly Hills. The memorial consists of a bronze-green spiral of sprocketed &quot;camera film&quot; above a multi-sided tower, embossed with full-length likenesses of early stars who appeared in famous silent movies. Those memorialized include Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Will Rogers, Conrad Nagel, Rudolph Valentino, Fred Niblo, Harold Lloyd, and Mix. There is also a Tom Mix museum in Dewey, Oklahoma. Opening in 1965, and still operational as of 2025, the Tom Mix museum in Dewey- which was also where his third wife Olive was raised and the birthplace of his eldest daughter Ruth- managed to obtain many of Mix&#x27;s personal items. Additionally, from 1986 to 2002 there existed another museum in his birthplace of Mix Run, Pennsylvania. Between 1980 and 2004, 21 Tom Mix festivals were held during the month of September, most of them in DuBois, Pennsylvania.

== Comic book appearances ==

Tom Mix was often portrayed in comic books, primarily during the heyday of Western-themed comics, the 1940s and 1950s.

He was first featured in 11 issues of Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;The Comics&quot; from 1937 to 1938.

The Ralston Purina Company, a sponsor of the radio series, produced nine issues of &quot;Tom Mix Comics&quot; in 1940–1941, and three issues of &quot;Tom Mix Commandos Comics&quot; in 1942. The 36-page comics were available by mail order, for two boxtops of any Ralston cereal.

Fawcett Comics published 61 issues of &quot;Tom Mix Western&quot; from 1948 to 1953.

Comics featuring Tom Mix were also published in Sweden, Germany, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain, including L. Miller &amp; Son&#x27;s &quot;Tom Mix Western Comics&quot;, which ran 85 issues from 1948 to 1951.

<doc id="549152" wikidata="Q1545824" url="?curid=549152" title="Limit price">
<text>A limit price (or limit pricing) is a price, or pricing strategy, where products are sold by a supplier at a price low enough to make it unprofitable for other players to enter the market.

It is used by monopolists to discourage entry into a market, and is illegal in many countries. The quantity produced by the incumbent firm to act as a deterrent to entry is usually larger than would be optimal for a monopolist, but might still produce higher economic profits than would be earned under perfect competition.

The problem with limit pricing as strategic behavior is that once the entrant has entered the market, the quantity used as a threat to deter entry is no longer the incumbent firm&#x27;s best response. This means that for limit pricing to be an effective deterrent to entry, the threat must in some way be made credible. A way to achieve this is for the incumbent firm to constrain itself to produce a certain quantity whether entry occurs or not. An example of this would be if the firm signed a union contract to employ a certain (high) level of labor for a long period of time. Another example is to build excess production capacity as a commitment device.

Due to the often ambiguous nature of cost in production, it may be relatively easy for a firm to avoid legal difficulties when undertaking such action. Due to this ambiguous nature, limit pricing may well be a commonly used strategy even in modern economies. However, it is often very hard to regulate, since limit pricing is often synonymous with a market monopoly. When a monopoly exists, it becomes very difficult to compare alternative prices with other, similar firms to confirm claims that limit pricing may be occurring.

==Simple example==
In a simple case, suppose industry demand for good X at market price P is given by:

 formula_1

Suppose there are two potential producers of good X, Firm A, and Firm B. Firm A has no fixed costs and constant marginal cost equal to formula_2. Firm B also has no fixed costs, and has constant marginal cost equal to formula_3, where formula_4 (so that Firm B&#x27;s marginal cost is greater than Firm A&#x27;s).

Suppose Firm A acts as a monopolist. The profit-maximizing monopoly price charged by Firm A is then:

 formula_5

Since Firm B will never sell below its marginal cost, as long as formula_6, Firm B will not enter the market when Firm A charges formula_7. That is, the market for good X is an effective monopoly if:

 formula_8

Suppose, on the contrary, that:

 formula_9

In this case, if Firm A charges formula_7, Firm B has an incentive to enter the market, since it can sell a positive quantity of good X at a price above its marginal cost, and therefore make positive profits. In order to prevent Firm B from having an incentive to enter the market, Firm A must set its price no greater than formula_3. To maximize its profits subject to this constraint, Firm A sets price formula_12 (the limit price).

<text>Floella Karen Yunies Benjamin, Baroness Benjamin, (born 23 September 1949) is a Trinidadian-British actress, singer, presenter, author and politician. She is known as presenter of children&#x27;s programmes such as &quot;Play School&quot;, &quot;Play Away&quot;, &quot;Jamboree&quot; and &quot;Fast Forward&quot;. On 28 June 2010, Lady Benjamin was introduced to the House of Lords as a life peer nominated by the Liberal Democrats. In 2024, she was honoured with the BAFTA Fellowship award for her services to television.

==Early life==
Floella Benjamin was born on 23 September 1949 in Pointe-à-Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago, one of six siblings, with one older sister, three younger brothers and a younger sister.

When her father decided to emigrate to Britain, with her mother later joining him along with Benjamin’s younger sister and youngest brother, the four older children were left in the care of family friends, with Benjamin and her older sister, Sandra, being separated from their brothers. The people looking after Benjamin and her sister were secretly abusive. Benjamin and her sister often tried writing to their parents to tell them about the abuse, but the letters were always read and censored before they were sent. In 1960 the children went to join their father in Beckenham, Kent. Floella Benjamin has discussed the racist experiences she had when arriving in Britain as an immigrant, such as with neighbours and at school.

Having left school to work in a bank, she studied for A-Levels at night school. After a spell as a stage actress in West End musicals, she began presenting children&#x27;s television programmes in 1976, notably &quot;Play School&quot; for the BBC.

==Entertainment==
Benjamin has appeared in &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;The Black Mikado&quot; and &quot;The Husband-In-Law&quot;, as well as several pantomimes. On screen, she appeared in the 1975 horror film &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Born&quot; and starred in the 1977 film &quot;Black Joy&quot;. Her television credits include &quot;Angels&quot;, &quot;Within These Walls&quot;, &quot;Crown Court&quot;, &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot; and &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;. She appeared as Juniper in the first episode of &quot;Bergerac&quot; (1981).

Benjamin read two stories for the &quot;Story Teller&quot; magazine series (1983 and 1984). She was chief executive of Floella Benjamin Productions Ltd, which had produced television programmes since 1987 and was dissolved in 2014. She had done the voice work of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;PG&quot; Video Standards Council information clips. In 2006, she appeared in an episode of &quot;The Line of Beauty&quot;.

Between 2007 and 2011, she guest-starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; as Professor Rivers of the Pharos Institute in the stories &quot;The Lost Boy&quot;, &quot;The Day of the Clown&quot;, &quot;The Eternity Trap&quot;, and &quot;Sky&quot;. She also narrated three &quot;making-of&quot; documentaries on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD boxed set &quot;The Black Guardian Trilogy&quot;. In 2007, she played a small role in the British comedy &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;.

She sings with Damn Right I Got The Blues, a rock and blues band, and has said, &quot;When I sing I am in my element.&quot;

She featured in the 2023-24 New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks display in London, reciting the poem &quot;In This World&quot; by the late Benjamin Zephaniah as part of the segment celebrating the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the &quot;Empire Windrush&quot;.

==Publications==
Benjamin&#x27;s 20th book, a memoir, &quot;Coming to England&quot;, about moving from Trinidad, was published in 1997, and is now used to teach modern history to young people. It was made into a television film by CBBC in 2005.

Other books written by Benjamin and published by various houses include titles such as &quot;Floella&#x27;s Fun Book&quot;, &quot;Why the Agouti Has No Tail&quot;, &quot;Caribbean Cookery&quot; and &quot;Snotty and the Rod of Power&quot;. Many of her titles are aimed at children and development.

==Honours and offices==

Benjamin was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting. At that time she was chairperson of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). She has also won a Special Lifetime Achievement award from BAFTA. She was chairperson of the Women of the Year Lunch for five years and a Millennium Commissioner. She is president of the Elizabeth R Commonwealth Broadcasting Fund and a governor of the National Film and Television School. She was a governor of Dulwich College, where her mother once worked and her son had attended.In 2006, she was awarded the degree of honorary D.Litt. (Exon) by the University of Exeter for contributions to the life of the United Kingdom. Benjamin succeeded Lord Alexander of Weedon as Chancellor of the University of Exeter. She famously hugged graduates instead of traditionally shaking their hands during the graduation ceremonies. Benjamin stepped down from office in winter 2016 after ten years in the post.

A statue of Benjamin is outside the University&#x27;s student guild.(shown on the right) The plaque reads Consideration ~ &quot;put yourself in the place of others and show empathy and respect. Never be judgmental&quot;.; Contentment ~ &quot;Don&#x27;t be jealous and envious, but be satisfied with what you have. That way you are open and ready to receive what is right for you.&quot;; Confidence ~ &quot;Be a decent human being, feel worthy and like the person you are. Give and love unconditionally and more will come back to you.&quot; This was the first public statue of a named living black woman in the UK.

On 10 December 2008, she was appointed a Deputy lieutenant of Greater London. In the 2010 Dissolution Honours List, she was appointed a Liberal Democrat life peer, being created Baroness Benjamin, of Beckenham in the County of Kent on 26 June 2010. She was the first actress to become a peer in the House of Lords. In her maiden speech, she spoke of choosing Beckenham to reflect the legacy of her mother and father, and the importance of childhood. She referenced her support of such charities as NSPCC, Childline, and Barnados, and their work to protect and support the health and wellbeing of vulnerable children.

In the 2020 Powerlist, Benjamin was listed in the Top 100 of the most influential people in the UK of African/African-Caribbean descent in the UK. The same year saw Benjamin appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to charity. On 12 March 2020, in an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace, she received the award from Prince Charles. In 2022 she was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt) by the University of Chester. She was made a member of the Order of Merit in 2022.

She was chosen to carry the Sceptre with Dove at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla. Benjamin was presented with the BAFTA Fellowship award at the 70th British Academy Television Awards. Of the honour, BAFTA stated &quot;We are honoured to present Baroness Benjamin the BAFTA Fellowship for her tireless support of children and young people, her impact on television broadcasting, and for her unwavering championing of diversity. She is an unstoppable force for good with a determination to create opportunities and positive role models for future generations that has seen her effect a tremendous amount of positive change over fifty years and counting. She is deservedly a national treasure and we can’t wait to celebrate the impact of her work to date on 12th May at the BAFTA Television Awards.&quot;

==Educational and charitable interests==

Benjamin&#x27;s interest in education has also seen her on the &quot;4Rs Commission&quot; established by the Liberal Democrats to look into primary education in the UK.

Benjamin is vice-president of NCH Action for Children and Barnardo&#x27;s, and was in the NSPCC&#x27;s Hall of Fame. She runs the London Marathon to raise funds for Barnardo&#x27;s and the Sickle Cell Society. She was a cultural ambassador for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In September 2011, she participated in the Great North Run. She features in the BBCs CBeebies animation &quot;Mama Mirabelle&#x27;s Home Movies&quot;.

In July 2007 she spoke of what she saw as the low standard of children&#x27;s television and in March 2013, she used a speech marking International Women&#x27;s Day to warn of the impact on children of the availability of violent pornographic material online, saying that this was leading to the increasing objectification of women.

Benjamin is a patron of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, having lost her mother to the disease in 2009.

In October 2015 in a talk to migrant children, Benjamin said that dropping her accent was the key to her success and that migrant pupils should do the same to avoid racism and bullying.

In June 2022, as chair of the Windrush Commemoration Committee, she unveiled a statue in Waterloo Station by the sculptor Basil Watson as the National Windrush Monument in the presence of the Duke of Cambridge.

<text>CRYPTREC is the Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees set up by the Japanese Government to evaluate and recommend cryptographic techniques for government and industrial use. It is comparable in many respects to the European Union&#x27;s NESSIE project and to the Advanced Encryption Standard process run by National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S.

== Comparison with NESSIE ==
There is some overlap, and some conflict, between the NESSIE selections and the CRYPTREC draft recommendations. Both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care. For instance, CRYPTREC recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while NESSIE selected none, but CRYPTREC was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices, while NESSIE was not. Similar differences in terms of reference account for CRYPTREC recommending at least one stream cipher, RC4, while the NESSIE report specifically said that it was &quot;notable&quot; that they had not selected any of those considered. RC4 is widely used in the SSL/TLS protocols; nevertheless, CRYPTREC recommended that it only be used with 128-bit keys. Essentially the same consideration led to CRYPTREC&#x27;s inclusion of 160-bit message digest algorithms, despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs. Also, CRYPTREC was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques, or at least to discuss their care in doing so; this resulted in particularly detailed recommendations regarding them.

== Background and sponsors ==
CRYPTREC includes members from Japanese academia, industry, and government. It was started in May 2000 by combining efforts from several agencies who were investigating methods and techniques for implementing &#x27;e-Government&#x27; in Japan. Presently, it is sponsored by
*the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry,
*the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs and Post and Telecommunications,
*the Telecommunications Advancement Organization, and
*the Information-Technology Promotion Agency.

== Responsibilities ==
It is also the organization that provides technical evaluation and recommendations concerning regulations that implement Japanese laws. Examples include the Electronic Signatures and Certification Services (Law 102 of FY2000, taking effect as from April 2001), the Basic Law on the Formulation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society of 2000 (Law 144 of FY2000), and the Public Individual Certification Law of December 2002. Furthermore, CRYPTEC has responsibilities with regard to the Japanese contribution to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27 standardization effort.

== Selection ==
In the first release in 2003, many Japanese ciphers were selected for the &quot;e-Government Recommended Ciphers List&quot;: CIPHERUNICORN-E (NEC), Hierocrypt-L1 (Toshiba), and MISTY1 (Mitsubishi Electric) as 64 bit block ciphers, Camellia (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Mitsubishi Electric), CIPHERUNICORN-A (NEC), Hierocrypt-3 (Toshiba), and SC2000 (Fujitsu) as 128 bit block ciphers, and finally MUGI and MULTI-S01 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers.

In the revised release of 2013, the list was divided into three: &quot;e-Government Recommended Ciphers List&quot;, &quot;Candidate Recommended Ciphers List&quot;, and &quot;Monitored Ciphers List&quot;. Most of the Japanese ciphers listed in the previous list (except for Camellia) have moved from the &quot;Recommended Ciphers List&quot; to the &quot;Candidate Recommended Ciphers List&quot;. There were several new proposals, such as CLEFIA (Sony) as a 128 bit block cipher as well as KCipher-2 (KDDI) and Enocoro-128v2 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers. However, only KCipher-2 has been listed on the &quot;e-Government Recommended Ciphers List&quot;. The reason why most Japanese ciphers have not been selected as &quot;Recommended Ciphers&quot; is not that these ciphers are necessarily unsafe, but that these ciphers are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, or international standards. There is the possibility that ciphers listed on &quot;Candidate Recommended Ciphers List&quot; will be moved to the &quot;e-Government Recommended Ciphers List&quot; when they are utilized more widely.

In addition, 128 bit RC4 and SHA-1 are listed on &quot;Monitored Ciphers List&quot;. These are unsafe and only permitted to remain compatible with old systems.

After the revision in 2013, there are several updates such as addition of ChaCha20-Poly1305, EdDSA and SHA-3, move of Triple DES to Monitored list, and deletion of RC4, etc.
