<text>Jenson Alexander Lyons Button (born 19 January 1980) is a British racing driver, who competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship for Cadillac Hertz Team Jota. Button competed in Formula One from to , and won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Brawn; he won 15 Grands Prix across 18 seasons.

Button began karting at the age of eight and achieved early success, before progressing to car racing in the British Formula Ford Championship and the British Formula 3 Championship. He first drove in F1 with Williams for the 2000 season. The following year he switched to Benetton, which at the start of the 2002 season became the Renault team, and then for the 2003 season he moved to BAR. He finished third in the 2004 World Drivers&#x27; Championship, before falling to ninth in the 2005 championship. BAR was subsequently renamed and became the Honda team for the 2006 season, during which Button won his first Grand Prix at the , after 113 races.

Following the withdrawal of Honda from the sport in December 2008, Button was left without a team for the 2009 season. In February 2009, Ross Brawn led a management buyout of Honda, creating Brawn GP and recruiting Button as a driver. Button went on to win a record-equalling six of the first seven races of the 2009 season, securing the World Drivers&#x27; Championship at the , having led on points all season; his success also helped Brawn GP to secure the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

At the start of the 2010 season, he moved to McLaren, partnering fellow British racer Lewis Hamilton. After finishing fifth for the team in 2010, Button ended the 2011 season as runner-up, before falling to fifth in the 2012 championship. Four more seasons with McLaren resulted in no further victories and he retired from Formula One at the end of 2016, making a one-off return at the to deputise for Fernando Alonso. From the 306 races that Button started, he won 15, qualified on pole position 8 times, took 50 podium finishes and scored 1,235 championship points.

After his F1 career, he became champion of the 2018 season of the Super GT Series alongside Naoki Yamamoto, with whom he shared a Honda racing car at Team Kunimitsu. He also competed part-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 15 Ford Mustang for Rick Ware Racing with support from Stewart–Haas Racing and sponsorship from Mobil 1.

==Early life and education==
Button was born on 19 January 1980 in Frome, Somerset and brought up in nearby Vobster, Mells. He is the fourth child of the half-South African Simone Lyons and former rallycross driver John Button from London&#x27;s East End, who was well known in the United Kingdom during most of the 1970s for racing his Volkswagen Type 1, which was nicknamed the &quot;Colorado Beetle&quot;. Jenson&#x27;s parents met in Newquay at a young age and were reunited after a musical concert at Longleat. According to John, Jenson was named after his Danish friend and rallycross opponent Erling Jensen, changing the &quot;e&quot; to an &quot;o&quot; to differentiate it from Jensen Motors, while Simone recalls that she named him Jenson after noticing a Jensen sports car and thought the change of spelling would be &quot;more mannish&quot;.

Button enjoyed racing from an early age, racing a BMX bike with friends after school, and began watching Formula One (F1) motor racing with his father around the age of five or six. He idolised four-time world champion Alain Prost for his calm personality and intellectual approach to driving. After his parents divorced when he was seven, he and his three elder sisters were brought up by their mother in Frome. Button was educated at Vallis First School, Selwood Middle School and Frome Community College. His karting career limited his studying and he left school with one GCSE. Button failed his first driving test for driving between two cars on a narrow road.

== Karting career ==
Button&#x27;s father gave him a 50cc bike for his seventh birthday; he discarded it after half an hour because it lacked speed, which would have required his father to remove its restrictor, and he disliked his father&#x27;s idea of progressing to the 80cc category. John talked to rallycross driver and Ripspeed car accessories owner Keith Ripp at an Earl&#x27;s Court racing car show about his son; Ripp recommended the purchase of a Zip go-kart suited for the newly formed Cadets class for eight to twelve year-old karters for the young boy. Button received the kart as a Christmas present in 1987 and he began karting at the Clay Pigeon Raceway in May 1988 aged eight following repeated questions by club members to his father on when Button would start racing.

He was required to drive on slick tyres on a wet track because his father wanted him to learn car control on a sodden surface and taught him basic driving techniques by standing at a corner and pointing to where his son should brake. In 1989, aged nine, Button won the British Super Prix. Midway through the year, his father spoke to him about progressing to the club level since others noticed he was competitive, which Button was interested in. He won all 34 races of the 1991 British Cadet Kart Championship and the title with team Wright Karts. Afterwards Button told his father his objective was to compete in F1 and he was given a map to chart his progress in karting. The two agreed to give each other more autonomy and Button was mentored by mechanic Dave Spencer in moving from the Cadets to Juniors class. Spencer told him to be more aggressive and less smooth driving Junior karts because they have more power than a Cadet kart. Button was also required to manage the condition of his tyres to retain grip.

Further successes followed, including three British Open Kart Championship wins. A series of sub-par performances in 1992 gave Button doubts over his ability to win races and he told his father he wanted to continue racing after dismissing the suggestion of two months away from karting. The family telephoned Spencer for advice; he and Button&#x27;s father constructed the young boy&#x27;s karts and influenced his school headteacher to change his fitness regime and had to eschew unhealthy beverages. Spencer helped him to observe and concentrate on how others drove their karts, and continued to coach Button until his youngest son Danny died in a multi-kart accident at the Hunts Kart Racing Club in Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire in December 1994.

Button was fourth in the 1994 RAC British Junior Championship after losing the opportunity to claim the title through a series of accidents. He joined the Birel team for that year&#x27;s Junior Intercontinental A European Championship and raced as a professional in the Junior Intercontinental A Italian Winter Championship. He was the youngest runner-up of the Formula A World Championship at age 15. Button was signed to drive Tecno-Rotax karts for Team GKS, coming fifth in the 1996 European Formula A Championship, third in the Formula A World Cup, and third in the American Championship. In 1997, he was moved to the top-level of karting Formula Super A by his team. Button won the Ayrton Senna Memorial Cup for finishing second in the 1997 Japanese World Cup, and became the youngest driver and first Briton to claim the European Super A Championship. He also was runner-up in the Winter Cup before the European Super A Championship.

== Junior car career ==
Aged 18, Button moved into single seater car racing after his mentor Paul Lemmens spoke to racing manager and former driver Harald Huysman about him. He was signed to businessman David Robertson and Huysman&#x27;s managerial stable, who found him sponsorship to continue driving. Robertson wanted Button to test a Carlin Motorsport Dallara F3 Mugen-Honda car at the Pembrey Circuit and quickly became acclimated with a more powerful vehicle and extra downforce. Huysman and Robertson wanted Button to enter Formula Three (F3) but Button said he could not do so with his inexperience in car racing and did not want to enter the category for fear of immediately being uncompetitive. Button instead moved to Formula Ford for the 1998 season. He took the British Formula Ford Championship in a Haywood Racing Mygale SJ98 car with nine victories and won the season-ending Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch. Button also finished runner-up in the European Formula Ford Championship with one victory from four races.

At the end of 1998, Button won the annual Autosport BRDC Award, which included a test in a McLaren MP4/14 F1 car that he received in November 1999. Huysman and Robertson sought a seat for him in F3 and spoke to Promatecme team owner Serge Saulnier, who did not want to sign Button because he was not part of Renault&#x27;s driver academy. Additional lobbying from Mygale and Lemmens convinced Saulnier to give Button a test at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in France. He impressed Saulnier and accepted his offer to drive at Promatecme. Saulnier taught Button on the downforce of F3 cars and how to maintain it.

Button drove in the British Formula 3 International Series in 1999 in a slightly underpowered Renault-Dallara F399 car compared to the Mugen-Honda engine, with guidance from trainer-physiotherapist Josef Leberer. Amongst more experienced racers, he won three times—at Thruxton, Pembrey and Silverstone—to finish the season as the top rookie driver, and third overall. He finished fifth and second respectively in the Marlboro Masters and Macau Grand Prix, losing out by 0.035 seconds to Darren Manning in Macau. Button was required to decide on his future post-season. He did not want another year in F3 and twice tested a higher-tier Formula 3000 (F3000) car with both the Super Nova Racing and Fortec Motorsport teams at the Jerez circuit in Spain, which he disliked because its sequential gearbox forced him to drive aggressively, and found the cars somewhat heavy.

==Formula One career==
===Williams (2000)===
In November 1999, Button had his McLaren test prize at the Silverstone club circuit in a MP4/13 car and impressed team owner Ron Dennis. He also tested for the Prost team at the Circuit de Catalunya after the team owner Alain Prost was impressed by Button&#x27;s ability and asked him to test. Prost offered Button a drive at his F3000 squad before becoming his F1 team&#x27;s test driver for one season to prepare for competitive driving. He did not commit because Prost had not prepared to fulfill the promise of a F1 seat. Huysman and Robertson declined Dennis&#x27; offer for Button to join the McLaren team and a seat from Jaguar chairman Jackie Stewart.

A vacant race seat became available at the Williams team following the departure of two-time CART champion Alessandro Zanardi. Other contenders for the seat included sports car driver Jörg Müller and Japanese Formula Three champion Darren Manning. On 24 December 1999, team founder and principal Frank Williams telephoned Button, who first thought it a joke, and asked whether he was ready to drive in F1 to which he said no. Button&#x27;s father instructed him to tell Williams he was indeed ready. Button talked with Williams and BMW motorsport director Gerhard Berger and a &#x27;shoot-out&#x27; test was arranged between Button and F3000 racer and test driver Bruno Junqueira at Jerez in a Williams FW21B car modified by being fitted with a BMW engine. with Button securing the drive, even though the majority of the team&#x27;s engineers preferred Junqueira. This made him Britain&#x27;s youngest ever F1 driver, beating the previous record held by Stirling Moss. Button did not hold a FIA Super Licence and the FIA president Max Mosley required him to complete on two consecutive days of testing and support from 18 of the 26 members of the F1 Commission. The FIA chose to issue him with a super licence regardless. Button worked with a physiotherapist to help build his strength to drive an F1 car.

A sixth-place finish at the season&#x27;s second race in Brazil made him the youngest driver in history to score a point. In his first six races, he qualified higher than his teammate Ralf Schumacher twice, and was consistently close in pace. However, Williams had intended to use Button only until they could exercise their option to buy the highly rated Juan Pablo Montoya out of his contract at Chip Ganassi Racing. A dip in Button&#x27;s form, combined with Montoya&#x27;s victory in the 2000 Indianapolis 500, led to Montoya being announced as his replacement midway through the season. Williams chose not to sell Button&#x27;s contract, keeping the right to recall him in 2003. He went to Benetton Formula on a two-year loan.

Button&#x27;s best qualification of the season was third place in the at Spa-Francorchamps; and his best result was fourth in the . After concerns about his inexperience, he made a few errors during the season, the most notable coming in the at Monza. Under safety car conditions Button swerved to avoid the pack which had bunched up, and crashed into a barrier. Button finished his debut season in eighth place with 12 points.

===Team Enstone (2001–2002)===
====Benetton (2001)====
For , Button partnered experienced driver Giancarlo Fisichella at Benetton, which had recently been purchased by Renault. His car was very uncompetitive due to a lack of power steering and horsepower to the faster teams coupled with a lack of pre-season testing and he was consistently outperformed by his teammate. He finished 17th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with a total of two points scored; his best result was a fifth-place finish at the . His poor form led to speculation he would be replaced before the end of the year; team principal Flavio Briatore said, &quot;Either he shows he&#x27;s super-good or he leaves the top echelon of drivers&quot;, and reportedly offered him the chance to leave. Briatore believed Button&#x27;s inexperience showed as he struggled to help his team set up a competitive car. His lack of success combined with an extravagant lifestyle led some press publications to dub him a &quot;playboy&quot;.

====Renault (2002)====

In , Benetton was re-branded as Renault, and Jarno Trulli joined the team to partner Button. In a bid to improve his public image over the pre-season interval, he changed his social life habits, spending more time training, and separating from Robertson and Huysman to join John Byfield&#x27;s sport managerial stable after Briatore talked to Button about Byfield. In late 2001, Briatore invited Button to spend ten days at a ranch in Kenya, to become acquainted with his peers and do physical training to eliminate a shoulder and back problem that had hindered him in 2001. Button spent a lot of time working with his engineering team and felt there was an improved understanding between them; Button described himself as &quot;very confident&quot; for the season.

At the season&#x27;s second race in Malaysia, he was set for his first podium before a rear suspension problem on the final lap dropped him to fourth place. Button&#x27;s performances were greatly improved from 2001 because his car had power steering and launch control; although often outqualified by Trulli, he showed the faster race pace to outscore his more experienced teammate. Despite Button&#x27;s performances, and his desire to stay with Renault, he was told by Briatore by telephone that test driver Fernando Alonso would replace him in 2003. Briatore faced criticism for his decision, but stated &quot;time will tell if I am wrong&quot;; he would also accuse Button of being a &quot;lazy playboy&quot;. In July, Button signed a two-year contract with British American Racing (BAR) with the option for a further two years after that to replace the outgoing Olivier Panis, partnering 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve, after discussions with several teams fell through. An important factor in his decision was the chance to work with David Richards, the BAR team principal, and he was impressed with the team&#x27;s long-term programme. He finished the season seventh with 14 points.

===Brackley based teams (2003–2009)===
====BAR (2003–2005)====
===== 2003 =====
Button faced early hostility from new teammate Villeneuve, who said Button &quot;should be in a boy band&quot; and was not on speaking terms with him. Their relationship did not improve after the first race in Australia: Villeneuve was due to pit, but stayed out an extra lap and made a pit stop when Button was due in, leaving Button waiting in the pit lane while Villeneuve&#x27;s car was serviced. Villeneuve blamed it on &quot;radio problems&quot;, but both Button and Richards hinted that they did not believe him. Button scored eight points in the first six races, including a fourth place at the . His relationship with Villeneuve improved thereafter because of his better performance and said the comments were caused by inter-team changes. A high speed crash for Button during Saturday qualifying in Monaco briefly knocked him unconscious, and he was detained in hospital overnight. Despite the accident Button still wanted to race, but was withdrawn by his team on medical advice. He was cleared to race for the following Grand Prix in Montreal. Button continued to outperform his teammate and this helped rebuild his previously faltering reputation. Just before the final race in Japan, Villeneuve lost his seat at BAR, so Button was partnered with Takuma Sato; he took his second fourth place of the season, and finished ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 17 points.

===== 2004 =====
The season was the first in which Button was the more experienced driver in his team. He was ambitious for the season, saying he wanted to challenge consistently for points and podium finishes. He took his first podium in the second race of the year—third-place at the . He followed it up two weeks later with another third-place in Bahrain. In the next race at Imola, he took his first pole position and finished second behind Michael Schumacher. He took 10 podiums in 18 races, and scored no points in three. Button came third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and helped BAR to take second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

In August, Button became embroiled in a contract dispute. On 5 August, Button chose to leave BAR and signed a two-year contract to return to Williams. He did so because BAR were not a works manufacturer team but Williams were in a partnership with BMW and felt they could help him win the Drivers&#x27; Championship. This was surprising, as Button was enjoying his best season to date, while Williams had been struggling. BAR insisted they had the right to exercise their option to retain Button. His management argued that the BAR option was not valid because it contained a clause allowing him to leave if BAR risked losing their Honda engines. They felt the new contract signed mid-year for Honda to supply engines to BAR was not definitive, and thus Button was free to move. The dispute went to F1&#x27;s Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of BAR on 20 October, forcing Button to stay with the team. Button separated from his manager John Byfield as a result, saying he had been badly advised. He asked his friend Richard Goodard to manage him, and employed a personal assistant in restructuring his organisation.

===== 2005 =====

Despite the feud, Button insisted he had BAR&#x27;s backing, and was optimistic for the season. He was unable to deal with regulation changes concerning aerodynamics and his car lacked pace as a result. Button was disqualified from third place at the after race scrutineers found his car had a second fuel tank inside the main one, that when drained, made his car underweight. The FIA International Court of Appeal banned Button and his team from the next two races as a result. Following his return, he took the second pole position of his career in Montreal, but crashed out after an error while running third. After the , Button scored in all of the remaining races with two third-place finishes in Germany and Belgium to end the season in ninth place on 37 points.

For the second consecutive year, Button had contract disputes involving BAR and Williams. Button had signed a pre-contract to drive for Williams in , but he now believed his prospects of achieving his maiden Grand Prix victory would be better at BAR, and that his Williams contract was not binding. Frank Williams insisted the contract was fully binding, and that there would be &quot;absolutely no turning back&quot;; his team required Button to fulfill some contractual obligations with sponsors. After several weeks of talks, Williams agreed to release Button in exchange for an estimated £18 million in compensation.

====Honda (2006–2008)====

===== 2006 =====

BAR was renamed Honda prior to 2006 following a buyout by the Japanese manufacturer and Button was partnered by the experienced Rubens Barrichello. Honda granted Button equal status and he would receive no preferential treatment alongside Barrichello. The new team performed well in testing, helped by the extra resources now available from Honda, and Button was confident in the car. He had been frustrated by not converting his increasing experience and confidence in his driving into success in 2005 and was excited about Honda&#x27;s car and engine development enabling race victory challenges. Button scored points in five of the first eleven races, finishing third at the second round, the , and pole position for the following . The first win of his career was at a rain-affected from a 14th position start – the 113th Grand Prix start of his career. Button finished fourth or fifth at each of the next five races and ended the season with a podium finish at the final round in Brazil. Over the last six races of the season, he scored more points (35) than any other driver.

===== 2007 =====
In , Button again drove with Honda alongside Barrichello. He was unable to partake in pre-season testing because of two hairline fractures to his ribs, sustained in a karting incident in late 2006. His Honda RA107 car had an aerodynamic imbalance from lacking grip after Shuhei Nakamoto was appointed Senior Technical Director following the departure of Geoff Willis. His year was worse than in 2006, driving within the middle of the field and usually qualifying outside of the top ten. He scored six points over the course of the season for 15th overall with a best finish of fifth at the rain-affected .

===== 2008 =====

Button stayed with Honda for , and continued to be partnered by Barrichello. He and a group of friends went to Lanzarote to establish a base to train for the upcoming season. Button was confident since the technical director Ross Brawn became Honda&#x27;s team principal and noticed wind tunnel designs of the car. Button began working with human performance coach Michael Collier that year. The Honda RA108 proved to be uncompetitive, and he scored three points that year because he finished sixth at the .

On the morning of 4 December 2008, the 2007–2008 financial crisis caused Honda to withdraw from F1, leaving Button&#x27;s chances of a drive in dependent on the team finding a buyer. He was informed of the news by Goodard the day before and Button changed his plans to discuss the withdrawal with colleagues and not the performance of his 2009 car. He declined an offer to drive for Red Bull Racing&#x27;s junior team Toro Rosso because they would not give him a podium-winning car and they wanted sponsorship funding.

====Brawn GP (2009)====
Brawn purchased the Honda team for a nominal fee and renamed it as Brawn GP in early March 2009. Button signed a contract to drive for the team in , and took a pay cut as part of the agreement. Although he was installed by bookmakers as a 100–1 outsider for the championship, Button&#x27;s Brawn BGP 001 car was quick and reliable in pre-season testing in Europe due to an efficient aerodynamic package, a powerful Mercedes-Benz V8 engine and grippy slick tyres. The car&#x27;s seat was lowered to make him comfortable.

Button won six of the first seven races with four pole positions, having benefited from a double diffuser design making him and the Toyota and Williams teams faster than others. Once the major teams had introduced their own reconfigured diffusers Button&#x27;s dominance ended, averaging sixth position in the following ten races and scoring 35 points after accumulating 61 in the first seven. This was due to the team spending 10 per cent of its allocated £7 million budget on developing the car and Button&#x27;s smooth driving style preventing him from generating heat into its tyres in cold weather. At the , Button was hampered in qualifying by a poor choice of tyres in the wet weather and could achieve 14th position. His championship campaign was boosted by Vettel qualifying 16th, but team-mate and closest rival Barrichello qualified on pole. In the race, Button finished fifth, taking enough points to secure the championship with one round remaining. At the final race of the season, the , Button qualified behind Barrichello again, but finished on the podium in third position.

In the off-season, Brawn and team principal Nick Fry informed Button they wanted him to sign an extension to his contract and be paired with Nico Rosberg. Button asked for a commitment to car development for 2010 and a close to a repeat performance of the 2009 season. Brawn and Fry said Mercedes would buy-out Brawn GP without locating potential sponsors, which Button found unappealing and told his manager Richard Goodard he desired a new challenge.

===McLaren (2010–2017)===
Goodard telephoned McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh to enquire about a drive for Button. Whitmarsh did not believe Button would leave Brawn GP since they had won the Championship; Goodard mentioned McLaren&#x27;s competitiveness at the end of 2009 and partnering 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton appealed to Button. Discussions took place at the team&#x27;s headquarters in Woking and a three-year deal was signed soon after. Button said he moved because he wanted the motivation and challenge from competing alongside Hamilton, but Whitmarsh cautioned the two before the start of the season he would observe any relationship problems between them.

====2010====

Button won at the and the in variable weather to take the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship. He later finished second in Turkey after a miscommunication with his team caused him to battle Hamilton for the victory. This cooled his relationship with Hamilton who believed McLaren favoured Button. He followed with two podium finishes and a trio of points scoring finishes to remain in contention for the championship. Button retired at the after Vettel hit him and punctured the radiator of his car. Second at Monza was followed by a fourth place in both Singapore and Japan. During the weekend, Button and his entourage were threatened by a number of criminals in the favelas on his way back from qualifying at Interlagos; nobody was harmed during the incident. Button was mathematically eliminated from retaining the title with a fifth place in the race and took fifth in the championship with third in Abu Dhabi.

====2011====
Button&#x27;s MP4-26 car for was built around his taller frame from intra-team input in late 2010. He believed the introduction of Pirelli tyres that season would suit his smooth driving style and said a world championship victory would make it difficult for him to retire from F1. Button began the season by finishing no lower than sixth in the first six races with three podium results. He won the rain-affected after two collisions dropped him to the back of the field and overtaking Vettel when the latter ran wide on the slippery track on the final lap. Button then won the , which was held in similar weather, and the , but his results over the course of the season mathematically eliminated him from championship contention when Vettel took the title in Japan. Button took 3 victories and 12 podium finishes to finish runner-up with 270 points.

====2012====
Whitmarsh wanted Button to remain at McLaren for the next three years while the latter held talks with Ferrari about a race seat in 2013. Before the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix, he signed a three-year extension to his contract with McLaren. Button was satisfied with the new MP4-27 car due to McLaren finding a regulation loophole banning the blowing of exhaust gases over parts of the vehicle to improve downforce. A victory in the season-opening and two-second-place finishes at the and the were the highlights of his first half of the season. His overall performance in the first seven races fell due to difficulty in generating temperature and the correct amount of grip into the new Pirelli short-life front tyres due to his smooth driving style and him switching brake materials multiple times to try and fix the issue made it worse. Button changed the set-up of his car and adapted himself to the tyres to retain temperature for better performance. The rest of Button&#x27;s season saw him achieve wins in Belgium and Brazil and top-five finishes in five of the next seven rounds for fifth overall with 188 points.

====2013====
Button was joined at McLaren by Ferrari Driver Academy graduate Sergio Pérez for and their relationship was cooler because the latter entered the team hastily. He was appointed a director of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA) in March 2013. McLaren built the MP4-28 car not in advance of regulation changes for , but from scratch. This caused Button to drive an unstable car with understeer, a lack of downforce and severe tyre degradation. After finishing ninth at the season-opening , McLaren introduced components from the MP4-27 onto the MP4-28, which had no significant effect and Button continued to attain sub-par results throughout the season with a best of fourth at the season-ending . He was ninth overall with 73 points. Button was involved in aggressive driving from his teammate Pérez early in the season in Bahrain and Monaco, annoying him.

====2014–2015====
He activated the terms of his contract to stay with McLaren for 2014 in September 2013, but considered taking a sabbatical from F1 following the unexpected death of his father in Monaco in January 2014. Button was joined by Kevin Magnussen, with whom he was able to build a rapport, and the MP4-29 car had an understeer from lacking front downforce and an unstable rear. He finished third at the season-opening after Red Bull Racing driver Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified for a fuel flow consumption infringement and his team lost a subsequent appeal against the decision. It would turn out to be his final career podium. Button achieved a quartet of fourth-place finishes and scored points seven more times for eighth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and 126 points. Button qualified better than Magnussen ten times and scored twice as many points.

Button became unenthusiastic over F1 and the press speculated on his future in the sport with rumors Alonso would be Magnussen&#x27;s teammate in . He wanted to remain at McLaren but was made insecure about his career and told himself to concentrate on the present and not be concerned about the future. Dennis did not want Button to drive for McLaren but fellow team shareholder Mansour Ojjeh told him Button should remain over Magnussen after reviewing the situation. Negotiations between Button and McLaren racing director Éric Boullier and team owner Ron Dennis concluded with an agreement for Button to continue racing on 10 December. Button agreed to take a pay cut, with his contract containing the option for a second year; McLaren or Button were able to activate clauses to break the contract after the season if one of the parties desired it. Button struggled in 2015 due to an unreliable and an underpowered Honda engine lacking straightline speed, securing four top-ten finishes and a best result of sixth at the . He was rarely able to progress past the first qualifying session and took 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 16 points.

====2016–2017====

He was retained by the McLaren team for following contractual discussions with Dennis and meetings with aerodynamics and engineers at the McLaren Technology Centre (MTC). Button received a 50 per cent pay rise by staying at McLaren for another year. He had considered returning to the Williams team but decided against it. His car&#x27;s new Honda engine was more powerful and allowed him to challenge for points-scoring finishes but reliability continued to hinder him and McLaren. He finished 15 of the 21 races that year, qualifying a season-high third at the , the highest start for the McLaren-Honda partnership. Button went on to finish the race a season-high sixth. He was unable to finish higher than eighth thereafter and ended his full-time career with a suspension failure at the season-ending . Button took 15th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 21 points finishing better than Alonso five times and qualifying higher on four occasions.

Before the , he told Dennis he planned to retire after the season. Dennis asked Button to wait before returning for discussion to which he said he had already decided. He suggested Button take a sabbatical and mull over the decision to retire while resting and made Button an ambassador for McLaren. He would work in the team&#x27;s simulator at MTC, represent them at sponsor functions and attempt to help them in car development. Button was retained by McLaren as reserve driver with the option to return to full-time racing for the team in if he and McLaren agreed to it. He was replaced as a GPDA director by Romain Grosjean. In April 2017, Boullier asked Button to drive in lieu of the Indianapolis 500-bound Alonso at the and agreed after Goodard told him there was no way to get out of the commitment because he was contractually bound to drive. He prepared in the team&#x27;s simulator instead of testing in Bahrain because he would learn nothing by not driving on a narrow street circuit. He retired late in the race following a collision with Sauber driver Pascal Wehrlein that damaged his car.

In November 2017, Button was replaced as McLaren reserve driver by 2017 FIA Formula Three European champion Lando Norris for 2018. His contract with McLaren expired without renewal at the end of 2017 allowing him to focus on other racing ventures.

In January 2021, Button rejoined Williams as a senior advisor on a multi-year deal. He will work with their race and Williams Academy drivers on-track and at the team&#x27;s headquarters and conduct ambassadorial duties for the team. Button focuses on the entire team and not one specific department but could not enter Williams&#x27; premises due to travel restrictions from the United States, and COVID-19 protocols restricted his mixing with team since he was in the Sky Sports broadcasting bubble.

==Super GT career==

Button became interested in Super GT in about 2011, and discussions with Honda led to his series debut at the 2017 Suzuka 1000km in a NSX-GT for Team Mugen with teammates Hideki Mutoh and Daisuke Nakajima. The trio finished 12th following two penalties and two tyre punctures. He also considered racing as a third driver for Acura Team Penske&#x27;s IMSA SportsCar Championship team, but was rejected. Button drove the full 2018 Super GT Series for Team Kunimitsu in the No. 100 GT500-class Honda NSX-GT alongside Naoki Yamamoto; Button wanted to drive a Bridgestone-shod car and drivers recommended Yamamoto because he speaks English. Button&#x27;s team helped him to communicate better, adapt to the series and its culture. He and Yamamoto won at Sportsland Sugo and took two-second-place finishes to enter the season-ending race at Twin Ring Motegi equal on points with the TOM&#x27;S duo of Ryō Hirakawa and Nick Cassidy. He held off Hirakawa to win the GT500 title by three points and was the first rookie champion since Toranosuke Takagi in 2005.

For the 2019 season, Button remained at Team Kunimitsu alongside Yamamoto in the renumbered No. 1 Honda. In an incident-filled season, Button and Yamamoto were taken out of the lead in the opening round at Okayama, a mistimed safety car at the second Fuji race and a poor tyre choice in the rain at Sugo cost the team possible victories. The pair achieved two podium finishes at both Fuji rounds and a sixth place at Motegi to finish eighth in the GT500 Drivers&#x27; Championship with 37 points. In October 2019, he drove the final two races of the season-ending Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) round at the Hockenheimring in his Team Kunimitsu NSX car as Honda&#x27;s wild card entry. He finished 9th in the first race and 16th in the second. Button did not enter the &quot;Super GT × DTM Dream Race&quot; at Fuji Speedway because his contract did not oblige him to do so, and left Super GT after 2019 because he did not want to fly frequently from the United States to Japan and wanted to explore other racing series.

==Sports car career==
Button made his endurance racing debut at the 1999 24 Hours of Spa, sharing a BMW Team Raffanelli 320i E46 with David Saelens and Tomáš Enge in the SP class, and retiring after 22 laps with fuel tank failure. Button agreed to drive most of the 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship sharing a BR Engineering BR1 car in the Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) class with Vitaly Petrov and Mikhail Aleshin for SMP Racing. Making his FIA World Endurance Championship debut at the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, electronic problems dropped the car down the order before the team retired with an engine failure late in the race with Button driving at the time. He finished fourth at the 6 Hours of Fuji and third at the following 6 Hours of Shanghai. Button missed the 1000 Miles of Sebring and 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps because of Super GT commitments, and the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans because his fiancée was due to give birth to their first child.

He made his British GT debut in the 2020 season&#x27;s final round, the three-hour Silverstone 500, sharing the No. 3 Jenson Team Rocket RJN McLaren 720S GT3 with team co-owner Chris Buncombe. The two finished the race in 14th position. Button drove Hendrick Motorsports&#x27;s NASCAR Next Gen Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Garage 56 entry alongside sports car driver Mike Rockenfeller and NASCAR racer Jimmie Johnson at the 2023 24 Hours of Le Mans. The trio completed 285 laps and were 39th overall following a drive line fault late in the event. He entered the ten-hour Petit Le Mans (part of the IMSA SportsCar Championship) driving JDC–Miller MotorSports&#x27; Porsche 963 alongside Rockenfeller and Tijmen van der Helm after broadcasting commitments prevented his entry to the Sahlen&#x27;s Six Hours of The Glen. The car started ninth and finished fifth.

For the 2024 24 Hours of Daytona, Button joined Louis Delétraz, Colton Herta and Jordan Taylor in sharing Wayne Taylor Racing with Andretti&#x27;s No. 40 Acura ARX-06 GTP car, finishing third overall. He returned to the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2024 and shared Team Jota&#x27;s No. 38 Porsche 963 with Phil Hanson and Oliver Rasmussen. Button appeared to be slower than his teammates and seemed frustrated with slower cars until he came more comfortable by the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He finished the season 19th in the World Endurance Drivers&#x27; Championship, achieving five points-scoring finishes that included a season-best result of sixth at the 6 Hours of Fuji.

Button is set to remain at Jota for the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship and will share the No. 38 Cadillac V-Series.R with Earl Bamber and Sébastien Bourdais in the Hypercar category after the team changed manufacturers from Porsche to Cadillac.

== Other racing ventures ==
Button was invited to the Race of Champions six times: in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017, reaching the semi-finals of the Nations Cup with Andy Priaulx for Team Autosport in 2007 and 2008 and finishing second in 2009. His best performance in the Race of Champions were the semi-finals in 2009. In 2019, Button drove off-road races in a Rocket Motorsports-entered Brenthel Industries Spec 6100 TT class truck with Buncombe and managing director Mazen Fawaz his co-drivers. This came about when Button told Buncombe they would race the Baja 1000 as Buncombe&#x27;s 40th birthday present and sought vehicle components. Navigated by Terry Madden, he finished no higher than the top 20 in the Mint 400 with retirements in the Vegas to Reno and the Baja 1000.

In 2020, while motor racing was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Button participated in eSports races. In January 2021, Button launched JBXE to compete in the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E from the 2021 season on. He stopped driving after one round to focus on managing his team and replaced himself with Kevin Hansen. Button made his first foray into historic racing at the 2021 Goodwood Revival, partaking in the Stirling Moss Trophy and the Royal Automobile Club TT Celebration races. He was set to drive an FC1-X car for the Xite Energy Racing team in the all-electric Group E category for the 2022–23 season of the off-road Nitro Rallycross series. However, he withdrew from the rest of the season after one round.
Button ran three NASCAR Cup Series races in 2023 for Rick Ware Racing in the No. 15 car, starting with the 2023 EchoPark Automotive Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (COTA). His best result over the three races was 18th position at COTA.

==Driving style==
Button has a smooth driving style; journalist Mark Hughes wrote in 2009, &quot;Button has a fantastic feel for how much momentum can be taken into a corner and this allows him to be minimal in his inputs—his steering and throttle movements in particular tend to be graceful and beautifully co-ordinated.&quot; This allows him to perform well in wet-weather where the front of the car tends to slide more than the rear, and many believe his smooth style better preserves the tyres during a race. He adapted his style in go-karts and transferred it to more powerful machinery. Since 2000, Button has braked with his left foot, by dragging the brake pedal and stopping the car in less time to control and modulate power. He likes to turn into a corner early under braking and balance the car on pedal application and steering, creating more strain in tyre loads for a longer physical lap but allowing for a higher minimum corner entry speed and allowing Button to adapt to a changeable or slippery track.

He is comfortable driving a car with understeer, prefers the rear to be stable into corners and on which he is able to lean on leaving them, and rarely locks the inside of his front tyres. His smooth driving also means he cannot generate the necessary tyre temperature on a cool track. Button occasionally cannot get his tyres to operate efficiently over a single lap in qualifying because his gentle steering produces less energy into the wheel. His driving gave him additional thought time and be less prone to making an error for improved consistency in races and notices events without the team necessarily instructing him on what to do. Button accurately exploits grip on a damp corner to adapt to his limits earlier than other drivers. During 2001 and 2007, when traction control was legal in F1, he was able to control the throttle pedal to prevent wheelspin, allowing him to be as fast due to his feel for grip exiting a turn.

===Driver number===
For the 2014 season, the FIA created a new sporting regulation allowing a driver to select a unique car number for use throughout their F1 career. Button chose the number 22, which was the one he was assigned in his 2009 championship season.

== Endorsements and philanthropy ==
The BBC signed Button to promote its BBCi digital television interactive service from December 2003 to January 2004. He is a brand ambassador for Head &amp; Shoulders, and appeared in advertising campaigns for the company. Other companies that Button has done business with are Hilton, Hugo Boss, Santander Bank, Tag Heuer, Vodafone, Baylis &amp; Harding, and Hackett London. As a result of Button&#x27;s endorsement money and Mercedes salary, he was listed as one of the world&#x27;s top-earning drivers in motorsports by &quot;Forbes&quot; between June 2012 and June 2013. He and multi-sport brand Dare 2b collaborated on a men&#x27;s ski range of clothing and accessories called AW20 in 2020. Button worked with car builder Ant Anstead, designer Mark Stubbs and business adviser Roger Behle to relaunch luxury coach maker Radford in early 2021. That same year, he co-founded the Coachbilt Whiskey premium blended scotch whisky brand with whisky consultant George Koutsakis.

Button is also involved in charitable work through the creation of The Jenson Button Trust. Established in March 2010, the Trust selects and nominates a number of charitable beneficiaries that receive funding. He is a patron of Make-A-Wish Foundation UK granting the wishes of terminally ill children and young persons, a sport ambassador for both The Prince&#x27;s Trust and the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, and supports the Sean Edwards Foundation. Button is part of Johnnie Walker&#x27;s &quot;Join The Pact&quot; initiative to promote responsible drinking, and began the &quot;Pink for Papa&quot; campaign in 2014 following the death of his father to raise funding for the Henry Surtees Foundation.

Button ran a restaurant, Victus, in Harrogate from 2011 to 2012. In 2012, he, Goodard and public relations officer James Williamson founded sports agency The Sports Partnership to provide public relations services and management to the sporting industry. Button, Buncombe and team principal Bob Neville founded sports car team Jenson Team Rocket RJN in late 2018. He was on the judging panel of the 2003 UK F1 Drivers&#x27; Challenge broadcast on the Five television programme &quot;Be A Grand Prix Driver&quot;, voiced his own character in the animated cartoon series &quot;Tooned,&quot; and since the , has analysed select races for Sky Sports F1.
==Public image==
Button has received a varying amount of press coverage from minor to extensive on his F1 career and personal life; this effect has been labelled &quot;Buttonmania&quot;. Prior to winning the 2009 championship, his lack of success led critics to label him &quot;a nearly man&quot; and &quot;a pin-up and lightweight&quot; for his photogenic appearance, but it ceased following his success. Ben Anderson of &quot;Autosport&quot; notes that the driver &quot;is rarely picked as one of grand prix racing&#x27;s true elite drivers&quot; and is not &quot;discussed in the same breath as those, such as Schumacher and Ayrton Senna&quot; due to &quot;a lack of absolute dynamism behind the wheel in difficult technical circumstances – perhaps holds him back from being regarded as among the true elite.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brad Spurgeon said that Button&#x27;s F1 debut began a trend of teams signing young drivers and how they would cope with pressure, performance and the media in the championship. BBC Sport&#x27;s Andrew Benson called him &quot;urbane and eloquent. Good-looking and charismatic, he is a marketing person&#x27;s dream, and has a ready wit that can edge into sarcasm if he is impatient or uncomfortable with a situation.&quot;

Button finished second to footballer Ryan Giggs in voting for the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. He also won the BBC West Country&#x27;s Sports Personality of the Year and the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. He won the 2000 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Newcomer Award for finishing eighth in that year&#x27;s F1 season, the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy in 2001, and the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy as the most successful British or Commonwealth driver in a season five times: from 2004 to 2006, 2009 and 2011. Button was voted the Autosport Rookie of the Year in 2000, the International Racing Driver Award in 2004 and 2009, and the British Competition Driver of the Year in 2003, 2009, 2011 and 2012. He won the BRDC Gold Star in 2004 and 2009, and was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame in 2017.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to motorsport. Button&#x27;s home town, Frome, has named a street and a footbridge over the River Frome after him, and has awarded him the freedom of the town. Button received an honorary doctorate in engineering from the University of Bath in December 2016. He has authored five books about his life and career.

Button&#x27;s 2009 championship winning season and Brawn GP&#x27;s rise to success is the focus of the 2023 Disney+ miniseries &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
His hobbies include mountain biking, competing in triathlons and bodyboarding. He also maintains an automobile collection. He was engaged to the English actress and singer Louise Griffiths before ending their five-year relationship in 2005. Button was married to his long-time Japanese girlfriend and model Jessica Michibata from 2014 to 2015. He married American model Brittny Ward in 2022 with whom he has a son and a daughter. They currently reside in Los Angeles. Button supports Bristol City Football Club.

On 3 August 2015, Button and his then wife Jessica were burgled at a rented Saint-Tropez home while staying with friends when robbers looted the house and stole belongings worth £300,000 including his wife&#x27;s £250,000 engagement ring. Reports suggested that the couple might have been gassed through the air conditioning system prior to the burglars&#x27; entry into the building.

<doc id="548214" wikidata="Q7923406" url="?curid=548214" title="Vested interest (communication theory)">
<text>Vested interest (Crano, 1983; Crano &amp; Prislin, 1995; Sivacek &amp; Crano, 1982) is a communication theory that seeks to explain how an attitude of self-interest can affect behavior; or, in more technical terms, to question how certain hedonically relevant (Miller &amp; Averbeck, 2013) attitudinal dimensions can influence and consistently predict behavior based on the degree of subjective investment an individual has in a particular attitude object. 

As defined by William Crano, &quot;vested interest&quot; refers to the degree to which an attitude object an idea, concept, or value with potential emotional interest is deemed ally relevant by the attitude holder. According to Crano, &quot;an attitude object that has important perceived personal consequences for the individual will be perceived as highly vested. Highly vested attitudes will be functionally related to behavior&quot; (Crano, 1983). Simply put, when people are more emotionally or psychologically invested in the results of an object (like a law or policy that may greatly affect them), they will behave in a way that directly supports or defies the object to protect their own self-interest.

For example, a 30-year-old learns that the legal driving age in his state is being raised from 16 to 17. While he may not agree with this proposed change, he is not affected as much as a 15-year-old would be and is unlikely to protest the change. A 15-year-old, however, has much more to lose (waiting another year to get a driver license) and is more likely to strongly oppose the proposed law. To gather support for his position, the 15-year-old might tell other soon-to-be drivers about the new law, so that they collectively have a vested interest in perhaps changing the law. This example illustrates how highly vested attitudes concerning issues depend on the individual&#x27;s point of view.

Another example of vested interest can be found in a study conducted by Berndsen, Spears and van der Pligt, which involves students from a University in Amsterdam where the teaching faculty proposed the use of English to teach the curriculum instead of Dutch. Vested interest, in this case, suggests that students would be opposed to the use of English rather than Dutch simply based on the potential impact lectures conducted in English might have on their grades.

==Key Factors==
===Involvement===
A key factor to consider with vested interest is the level or type of involvement the individual has with a particular attitude object. This can be broken up into three main involvement components: Value-relevant, Impression-relevant, and Outcome-relevant. Value-relevant involvement concerns behaviors which support/reinforce values of the individual. Impression-relevant involvement relates to those behaviors which serve to create or maintain a specific image of the individual. This could, in some ways, be compared to a low-self monitor. Outcome-relevant involvement concerns those behaviors which hold direct personal consequences at a premium for the individual and as a result, corresponds most closely to vested interest.

The concept of involvement closely relates to collaboration which encompasses value, impression and desired outcome. Vested interest is essential in achieving success in collaboration where two or more individuals have the potential to gain or lose. Organizations who strive for collaborative success benefit from understanding vested interest and that of other collaborators in order to maintain a supportive level of involvement.

===Ego involvement===
The way people view vested interest as distinct from ego involvement, is a construct that has been the topic of social psychological research for many years. In a study conducted by John Sivacek and William D. Crano, they prove the aforementioned statement that ego involvement and vested interest are indeed separate. Sivacek and Crano state, &quot;It was possible to have circumstances that an individual would perceive as involving but that it would not arouse his or her vested interest.&quot; The main focus points of ego-involvement concern the individual&#x27;s psychological attitudes that are experienced as being a part of “me”. The more emotionally connected people are to an idea, concept, or value, minor differences in beliefs can be viewed as significantly large and perhaps make harsh judgments or have stronger reactions. Conversely, a person with less emotional connectivity (low ego-involvement) will have more latitude in their reactions. It is important to note that while highly vested attitudes can be experienced as ego involving, the opposite is not always true. An individual can be ego involved in a certain attitude that has no hedonic consequence. For example, religious or political ideals with little or no hedonic value may still be ego-involved because individuals view those types of beliefs as part of who they are.

Ego-involvement, as it pertains to vested interest, is relative to Social Judgment Theory in that the concept of one&#x27;s identity is the primary focus of efforts in continued involvement. Essential to social judgment theory is the idea of ego thus actions or ideas with a varying degree of ego involvement carry a commensurate amount of vested interest to the individual as detailed by Sherif, Kelly, Rogers, Sarup, and Tittler. Sherif, et al. conducted a series of studies to develop “indicators of ego involvement” (p. 311). One of the leading questions they sought to answer was how much ego involvement (vested interest) does an individual in a situation with no alternatives solutions have and does this ego involvement correlate to the number of options at hand. Sherif et al., suggest the question was answered by Beck and Nebergall in 1967 who stated that individuals with little to no options have corresponding vested interest indicating low ego involvement.

===Attitude importance===
The factor to consider with vested interest and its application towards attitude-consistent actions is attitude importance. Attitude (or issue) importance concerns not only matters of personal consequence, but also matters of national or international interest. While both of these can fall in line with each other, vested interest and attitude importance are not the same. For example, consider the plight of an African nation that has been ravaged by an influenza epidemic. Although an individual in America may consider this objectively important, because of the low probability of personal consequence i.e., vested interest his resultant behavior may not be indicative of his attitude towards the epidemic. In other words, since the issue is of little hedonic relevance to the perceiver, the amount of vested interest is low, and is therefore unlikely to produce attitude-consistent actions. Geographic distance and cultural differences are also a factor in attitude importance. Tragic circumstances halfway around the world or shocking behaviors by members of a culture different from the perceiver, will most likely never result in attitude change. The physical distance or cultural difference of an occurrence directly correlates to the vested interest of the perceiver. Things too far away or customs perceived to be too strange will almost never trigger a vested interest.

Indicators of vested interest can include attitude importance, as detailed by Jon Krosnick who defined this concept by stating that “central, ego-involved, and salient attitudes” often include attitudes significantly important to individual interests. In politics, for example, voters have a vested interest in candidates whose values (policy) align with their own to include attitudes toward these values. Due to the nature of politics, voters come to conclusions about one candidate over another based on perceived attitude importance (object) on these policies rather than vocal support alone placing a high value on this concept as it pertains to vested interest.

Attitude object continuously makes an issue salient which correlates to outcome relevant involvement. Two differences exist between vested interest and outcome relevant involvement where attitude objects remain highly important. Initially, outcome relevant objects retain a high degree of vested interest while not appearing to be. Secondly, outcome relevant involvement suggest interest ends once the goal is achieved whereas vested interest suggests a self-perpetuated interest.

==Components==
There are five key components that may diminish or enhance the effects of vested interest on attitude-behavior consistency. These are (a) stake, (b) attitudinal salience, (c) the certainty of the attitude outcome link, (d) the immediacy of attitude-implicated consequences, and (e) the self-efficacy of the individual to perform an attitudinally implicated act. Attitudes affect behavior. However, social psychologists recognize that contextual, interpsychic, and intrapsychic sources of variation can drastically affect the strength of this relation. A factor that has been shown to strongly affect attitude-behavior consistency is self-interest or vested interest. The following sections explain each of these variables in greater detail.

===Stake===
Stake refers to the perceived personal consequence of an attitude that is directly related to the intensity of vested interest and influences components that contribute to attitude-behavior consistency. In its basic form, the more that is at stake concerning a particular issue, the stronger the attitude will be. Consequently, as attitude strength increases, the consistency of attitude-based actions also increases.

Referring to the concept of vested interest as it relates to attitude-behavior consistency, stake is an individual&#x27;s macro involvement in a particular situation where the consequence is salient. In a situation where stake is operationalized using certainly and immediacy, one found the likely effect of this was behavior relative to the immediate consequence, positive or negative. For instance, in a study conducted to measure the relevance stake has on vested interest, students given a health assessment showed greater enthusiasm for items inquiring about donating blood when saving a life was salient (i.e. a child&#x27;s life depends on my donation).

Stake may contribute to attitude-behavior consistency by inducing thoughts that support the attitude. This serves as the basis for future behavior. Stake may also strengthen the attitude-behavior relation by indirectly amplifying the awareness of stimuli associated with people&#x27;s attitudes. Stake is the most powerful impression that comes from all the components of vested interest regarding attitude and behavior. Stake influences perceptions of attitude and action, but also of other action-relevant components as well. When stake is high, people also find the critical issue highly salient. Stake also affects the perception of immediacy. The greater the personal consequence of the issue, the more pressing the issue is perceived to be. Finally, stake was found to affect the perception of immediacy. The greater the personal consequence of the issue, the more pressing it was perceived to be. The phrases, &quot;the stakes are/were high&quot; or &quot;high stakes&quot;, are used when issues of high salience or immediacy are raised, usually in regards to gambling or other high-risk activities involving vested interest.

===Salience===
Salience refers to the perceiver&#x27;s awareness of the effects of an attitude upon himself. In other words, the prominence of an issue, as perceived by an individual, shapes the strength of his resulting attitude. Salient attitudes have a greater effect directly on subsequent behavior. Linking this discovery to vested interest, the research concluded that the salience effect was heightened when the attitude had important personal outcomes for someone. When the consequences of the behavior issuing from an attitude are highly salient, attitude-behavior consistency increases. If consequences are not salient, the consistency of the effects of vested interest on attitude behavior will be dramatically reduced. For instance, two people may have negative attitudes towards living near a prison. The first person lost a loved one at the hands of an inmate who escaped during a jailbreak. The second person simply does not like the eyesore the prison building creates in the area around his home. The first person&#x27;s attitude towards inmates and prisons will probably be more salient than that of the second person who has not experienced a similar trauma. The first person&#x27;s more salient attitude will foster the operation of vested interest, which will result in greater attitude-behavior consistency.

Attitudes that have been acquired through direct experience, such as the example just given, may be more salient than those acquired through vicarious processes. This greater salience results in greater consistency in attitude behavior. The attitude of someone who is non-salient reduces vested interest and weakens attitude-behavior consistency. The most powerful impression to emerge from all the analyses is the overwhelming effect of stake, or personal consequence, on attitude and behavior. When stake is high, people assume that a person would find the critical issue highly salient. Stake does not interact with, but enhances the perception of, issue salience. This is an important effect, because salience significantly affects actions that are expected to happen.

Additionally, salience can be described as the most recent and accessible memory associated with a specific object (i.e. idea) in which an individual has developed their own unique attitude. Mortality, for instance, would become salient when faced with a situation where death was probable or the known death of a friend, relative or an experienced event which resulting in someone&#x27;s death. This death salience would then influence behavior for a short amount of time following the event.

===Certainty===
Certainty refers to perceived likelihood of personal consequences as a result of an attitude or action. Simply stated, if a certain course of action is taken, then the chances of a specific event occurring as a result of this action are evaluated by the perceiver to help shape his resultant attitudes and behaviors. Certainty can be easily applied to situations in which an individual knowingly takes a calculated risk. For instance, let&#x27;s continue with our aforementioned example of people living near a prison. Although the chance of a prison escape is minimal, particularly in a maximum-security prison, it could occur and crimes against those living close by would increase. Those living further away from the prison might argue that a prison break is unlikely and that there is no real risk. Alternatively, those living close to the prison could make an equally valid argument about the dangers of living near the prison in the event of prisoners escaping. Still others might realize there to be a potential risk to their safety, but would not deem it risky enough to move elsewhere.

Certainty in attitude, relative to vested interest, remains difficult to define without an understanding of two particular concepts. One is the acceptance of truth in the events or idea requiring approximation of occurrence. Two requires that certainty is not dependent on external factors which can undermine its validity. Certainty must be a concept which is pushed onto us much like truth is a certainty beyond our immediate control.

If the consequences of an attitude consistent act are uncertain, attitude-consistent action is not likely to occur, due to the fact that vested interest will be reduced. An example of this is a person who has a negative attitude towards living near a prison. If the person assumes that the link between living near a prison and being a victim of a violent crime is minimal, then health and safety promoting behaviors consistent with this negative attitude are not likely. However, if someone believes that living near the prison and being a victim of a violent crime is almost certain, that person would be unlikely to move close to the prison, assuming the person has a positive attitude toward safety or a negative attitude toward prisons and inmates.

===Immediacy===
Immediacy refers to an individual&#x27;s perceived amount of time between an action and its resulting consequences. Immediacy can be considered an extension of certainty, however, these two entities are completely separate. For instance, in our prison example, people in opposition to the construction of the prison in their neighborhood may have felt that the amount of time to build the prison to and the eventual housing of prisoners was not long enough to make an informed decision. They may also feel that it is only a matter of time before something negative happened to the local citizens as a result of having a prison nearby.

Immediacy refers to the apparent temporary lag between an attitudinally implicated action and its consequences. If the results of an attitude consistent action are thought to be immediate rather than delayed, the effects of stake, or vested interest, on attitude-behavior consistency will be more dramatic. In other words, if a person living near the prison in the previous example perceives the possibility of a jailbreak could occur at a much later time in life, he may act in manner that is not consistent. This is because the lack of immediate consequences reduces the perception of vested interest. Therefore, immediacy can help explain self-destructive behaviors.

Immediacy, in vested interest, can also be thought of in terms of positive or negative consequence disassociated from a timeline. Vested interest such as organ donation, for example, make life and death salient which brings about the concept of immediacy to decide not necessarily to act. This is seen in a mechanism which allows people to agree to donate organs in the event of their death (i.e. drivers licenses).

Another example of immediacy is that of marketing companies who implement immediacy to encourage consumers to act or remain inactive. If what they market is something a person is highly vested in and the marketing firm has simultaneously created an immediate need, then they have done their job to get consumers to behave as they desired. This use of immediacy can be both helpful and harmful. Consumers who are not well versed in how marketing works may find themselves situations they did not wish to be in. However, consumers who are cognizant of how marketing works may find this very useful in how they do or do not expend their resources.

===Self-efficacy===
Self-efficacy in regards to vested interest, is the amount that an individual believes that they are capable of performing an action associated with an attitude or advocated position. In short, it is a person&#x27;s sense of competence in regards to a specific task. Continuing with our prison example, residents with high vested interest that was covered by the other four components would need self-efficacy to protest the location of the new prison. In other words, the residents opposing the prison would have to believe in their abilities to effectively stop the construction. Conversely, if they lacked self-efficacy and therefore believed there was nothing they could do, then they would not act on their held attitude and vested interest will not have been attained. Variations in self-efficacy will produce differences in perceptions of the likelihood of someone working against the opposed plan. Higher levels of manipulated self-efficacy result in higher levels of expected action. However, variations in stake also influence perceptions of self-efficacy. When the stakes are high, people assume higher levels of perceived self-efficacy.

Another way the concept of self-efficacy can be described is using social cognitive theory to understand the role thought, drive and emotion have on self-efficacy (20). Cognitively, one works to quantify actions, emotion, and drive resulting in self-efficacy. However, this concept remains volatile as a change in one or more of these influences degrades self-efficacy. An example of this would be physical fitness, in that, elevated or decreased self-efficacy will cause one to accept or deny a strenuous task daily.

==Relevant research==
===Drinking age experiment===
Various studies have been conducted to determine the effects of vested interest on attitude strengths. In one such study, Crano and Sivacek visited a university in Michigan and gathered the results of a proposed drinking-age referendum. The referendum sought to increase the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. The respondents were divided into three categories: 1. high vested interest (those who would be significantly and immediately affected as a result of the referendum), 2. low vested interest (those who would be unaffected by the law change at the time of its inception), and 3. moderate vested interest (those who fell between the first two extremes). Although 80% of the subjects were opposed to the referendum, their respective levels of vested interest clearly indicated that the strength of their attitudes significantly affected their resultant behaviors. Half of the highly vested interest groups joined the anti-referendum campaign, but only a quarter of the moderately vested interest group and an eighth of the low vested interest group joined the campaign. These results support Crano&#x27;s theory of vested interest and reinforce the implications and considerations of stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy discussed above. It also proves the correlation between vested interest and action, based on what level of involvement the three types of students were willing to participate in.

===Comprehensive exam experiment===
In a second study, Sivacek and Crano visited Michigan State University. In this experiment, subjects were informed that the university was considering the addition of a senior comprehensive examination to the graduate prerequisites. Respondents were given the following options:
#Do nothing
#Sign an opposing petition
#Join a group that opposed the referendum
#Volunteer specific numbers of hours to the opposing group&#x27;s activities
The respondents were grouped into the same three categories as the drinking age study: high, moderate, and low vested interest. The study found that those with the highest levels of vested interest were significantly more inclined to take action based on their attitudes concerning the issue; that is, their resultant behaviors (signing the petition, joining the group, pledging multiple hours with the group) occurred much more consistently and prevalently than that of the other two vested interest groups.

===Assumed consensus===
Crano conducted another study to prove that vested interest may affect people&#x27;s belief that a majority of a population will support their attitude on an issue. This bias is known as false-consensus or assumed-consensus effect. Under the guise of a public opinion survey, Crano created high and low vested interest groups by identifying whether upper- or lower-classmen would pay a surcharge to subsidize lost funding from the government. The class who was selected to pay the surcharge had a high degree of vested interest while the student body not required to pay exhibited a lower degree of vested interest. The study then determined the participants estimate of what percentage of the student body would support their beliefs regardless of impact. Crano found that vested interest influenced assumed consensus and students believed that a majority of the university&#x27;s population would support their plight even though only half would be affected.

===The effect of smoking on attitudes toward cigarette tax and smoking restrictions===
Dale Miller and Rebecca Ratner conducted this study utilizing 81 male and female students at the University of Yale. In this experiment the objective was for half of the participants to show their own attitude toward smoking policies and the other half to show their thoughts on others attitudes toward smoking policies. The group with the questionnaire regarding their personal attitude about smoking were asked: 1. if they were a smoker or a nonsmoker, 2. how heavy or light a smoker they were, 3. whether they would support an increase on cigarette tax, 4. would they do away with smoking advertisements, and 5. their thoughts on smoking restrictions in public places. The second half of the participants were asked what percentage they thought smokers would support the previously mentioned policies for smokers or nonsmokers. They were not asked whether or not they smoked. The results of this study replicated Green and Gerkin&#x27;s 1989 study that nonsmokers had more support for smoking restrictions than did those that smoke. These results supported the hypothesis: &quot;Smokers in this study were more opposed to policies that regulated smoking than were nonsmokers, but the effect of smoking status on expressed attitudes was significantly less than that predicted by respondents&quot;. The smokers had a higher vested interest in smoking policies because they were directly affected. This study also revealed a direct correlation between vested interest and attitudes.

===Voter Registration===
Barbara Lehman and William Crano conducted a study regarding the persuasive effects of vested interest on attitude concerning political judgment which was published in 2001. In this study, they utilized data from 1976 national election studies concentrating on three areas (e.g. living conditions, health insurance and school integration). Their discoveries were such that self-interest was a significant contributor to values placed on all three areas of concern. Further, outside analysis of the study revealed self-interest had a direct correlation to ideologies, affiliation, and intolerance. Additionally, respondents with vested interest in any one of the three areas were more than likely to endorse candidates whose focus was in that particular area.

 These findings, set in 1976, show a significant relationship between vested interest and aligned values associated with electoral candidates which can be either perceived or marketed. Understanding these values, one can conclude, would allow for use of vested interest harvested by surveys to decide which values to champion for use in maximizing voter endorsement.

==Issues==
Vested interest appears to affect people&#x27;s tendency to overestimate the extent to which others agree with their beliefs, a bias known variously as the false-consensus or assumed-consensus effect. If people tend to overestimate the number of others who share their beliefs, this tendency should be exacerbated in situations involving personally consequential, or highly vested, beliefs. Research supports this expectation. College student participants who thought that a new university policy would disadvantage them personally assumed that the great majority of the student body would evaluate the policy as they had, despite the fact that only half the student population would be similarly disadvantaged.

==Summary==
Each of the five components (stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy) co-exist within an individual&#x27;s realm of conscious judgment. If it creates a sufficiently strong attitude, any of these components can cause an individual to adopt or reject a certain position. All five are considered any time an individual is presented with a message that attempts to influence or persuade him to adopt a certain position or perform an action. The process of evaluating these components can range from almost instantly to taking several years. At any rate, all five are considered (consciously or subconsciously) before making a decision with implications of vested interest.

<text>Michael John Kricfalusi ( ; born September 9, 1955), known professionally as John K., is a Canadian illustrator, blogger, and former animator and voice actor. He is the creator of the animated television series &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, which was highly influential on televised animation during the 1990s. From 1989 to 1992, he was heavily involved with the first two seasons of the show in virtually every aspect of its production, including providing the voice of Ren Höek and other characters. In 2009, he won the Inkpot Award.

Born in Quebec, Kricfalusi spent his early childhood in Germany and Belgium before returning to Canada at age seven. He acquired his skills largely by copying cartoons from newspapers and comic books as a child, and by studying cartoons and their production systems from the 1940s and 1950s. His main influence is Bob Clampett. After moving to Los Angeles in 1978, he collaborated with Ralph Bakshi and worked for Filmation, Hanna-Barbera, and DIC Entertainment on various shows. In 1989, Kricfalusi co-founded the animation studio Spümcø, with which he remained until its dissolution in 2005.

Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi from &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; due to creative differences and his failure to meet production deadlines; the show continued for three additional seasons without his involvement. Following this, he directed and produced animated television commercials and music videos for entertainers such as Björk and Tenacious D. In the late 1990s, he created the first cartoons made exclusively for the Internet: &quot;The Goddamn George Liquor Program&quot; and &quot;Weekend Pussy Hunt&quot;. He returned to television with &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; and the adult animation spin-off &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;. Since 2006, Kricfalusi has maintained a personal blog dedicated to cartoons and animation. There, he popularized the term &quot;CalArts style&quot;, a pejorative which was later used by others to criticize a widespread 2010s cartoon aesthetic.

In 2018, Kricfalusi was accused by two former Spümcø artists of grooming and sexually abusing them in the late 1990s, when they were teenagers. Kricfalusi released an apology for his behavior, blaming his mental health and &quot;poor impulse control&quot;. He has since declared his withdrawal from the professional animation industry.

==Early years==
Michael John Kricfalusi was born on September 9, 1955, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada to Michael Kricfalusi, who was of Ukrainian descent, and Mary Lou Kricfalusi (née MacDonell), who was of Scottish and English descent. He has one sister named Elizabeth. He spent his early childhood in Germany and Belgium while his father was serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He would watch weekend screenings of European feature-length cartoons such as &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; at Air Force cinemas. At age seven he returned with his family to Canada. After their return they moved from Montreal to Ottawa in the middle of a school season, and Kricfalusi spent much of his time that year at home, watching Hanna-Barbera cartoons and drawing them. Kricfalusi&#x27;s interest in golden-age animation crystallized during his stay at Sheridan College, where he attended weekly screenings of old films and cartoons at Innis College held by film archivist Reg Hartt, among them the cartoons of Bob Clampett and Tex Avery, which left a deep impression on Kricfalusi. After he was expelled from Sheridan College at the end of 1978, Kricfalusi moved to Los Angeles, California, intending to become an animator.

==Career==
===Entering the animation industry===
After moving to Los Angeles, Kricfalusi was introduced to Milt Gray by Bob Clampett, suggesting he should join Gray&#x27;s classical animation class. Gray was working for Filmation at the time, and soon Kricfalusi found work there as well, getting his start on shows like &quot;Super Friends&quot; and &quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot;. His first independent cartoon was a short called &quot;Ted Bakes One&quot;, which he produced with Bill Wray in 1981 for a cable channel. From 1979 to the mid-1980s, Kricfalusi worked for Filmation and later Hanna-Barbera and DIC Entertainment on various shows that he once described as &quot;the worst animation of all time&quot;. However, he did enjoy his work as a layout artist on the 1985 series of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; as he was able to train a team of Taiwanese animators to draw characters more emotive and wild, which at the time was considered radical. He recalls being &quot;saved&quot; from having to work on these cartoons by director Ralph Bakshi, who had worked with him before in 1980 and 1982. They began working on the designs for the film &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Girl&quot;, which was sold to TriStar Pictures but was later cancelled. Under Bakshi, Kricfalusi directed the animation for The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1986 music video &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;.

===&quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;===

The team&#x27;s most successful project was &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; for CBS, based on the classic Terrytoons character. The series was well-received, and it is considered the forerunner of creator-driven cartoons. Kricfalusi directed eight of the twenty-six episodes and supervised the series. At the beginning of the second season, Kricfalusi left the show. The production of &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; was very different from other cartoons at the time, gaining creative and artistic leeway thanks to the success of the irreverent &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; on CBS a year before. The animators had much more creative input, driven by Kricfalusi&#x27;s production system that emphasizes artistic contribution in every step of the process, from outline to storyboard to layout to the animation.

&quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; was cancelled amidst controversy for allegedly depicting the main character snorting cocaine. Bakshi maintained that neither he nor Kricfalusi had the character sniffing cocaine, and that the character was sniffing the crushed petals of a flower, which were handed to him in a previous scene in the cartoon. In 1994, Kricfalusi pitched a revival series of Mighty Mouse to Paramount, which would have featured other Terrytoons characters such as Deputy Dawg, but they rejected the idea.

===&quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;===

Kricfalusi left Bakshi&#x27;s studio to work on &quot;The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil&quot; for ABC, where he teamed up with many of the people who would later work with him on many of his Spümcø projects. ABC had been negotiating for the production of the show with the Clampett family, who insisted that Kricfalusi be part of the production as he was a strong proponent of Bob Clampett&#x27;s cartoon style. The long negotiations delayed the start of production to mid-July, causing much of the animation to be rushed in order to meet the September deadline. Tensions rose between Kricfalusi and ABC over the tone of the show, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere for the show&#x27;s crew. The more ABC strove to soften the show, the more Kricfalusi pushed for shocking and offensive material. The Clampett family were ultimately not very happy with the cartoon, but remained supportive of Kricfalusi. ABC canceled the show after six episodes, finding the humor not suitable for children&#x27;s programming.

===&quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;===

Kricfalusi formed Spümcø animation studio with partners Jim Smith, Bob Camp and Lynne Naylor. They began working on a pilot for &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; on behalf of Nickelodeon, after the eponymous characters were favored by Nickelodeon producer Vanessa Coffey in a presentation by Kricfalusi. The show came to garner high ratings for Nickelodeon, and at the time was the most popular cable TV show in the United States, but the network disagreed with Kricfalusi&#x27;s direction of the show, and disapproved of his missed production deadlines. Kricfalusi points specifically to the episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, which depicts the character George Liquor as an abusive father figure, as the turning point in his relationship with Nickelodeon. One of the episodes, &quot;Nurse Stimpy&quot;, did not meet Kricfalusi&#x27;s approval because of the low quality of the rough cut of the episode that they received from the overseas studio, leading him to use the alias Raymond Spum in its credits. Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi&#x27;s contract late September 1992, leaving it to Nickelodeon&#x27;s Games Animation studio, which continued producing it for three more seasons before its cancellation.

===&quot;The Ripping Friends&quot;===

Fox Kids started airing the television series &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; in 2001, created by Kricfalusi and Jim Smith. Kricfalusi had previously tried pitching the show in the late 1980s, but networks considered it &quot;too extreme&quot; so did not pick it up. Kricfalusi felt the show&#x27;s supervisors were doing away with the Spümcø style and was displeased with the direction of the show. He considers the episodes he was involved in to be experimental. One of his contributions to the show was directing the voice-actors, which he &quot;really worked-out&quot; so much that he was afraid he&#x27;d give one of them a heart attack.

===&quot;Ren and Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;===

In 2003, Spike TV produced a new show featuring Ren &amp; Stimpy, which was written and directed by Kricfalusi. The first three episodes were based on fan ideas and scripts that were rejected by Nickelodeon during the original show&#x27;s run. According to Kricfalusi, Spike pushed for more &quot;South Park&quot;-like themes in the new show. While he was initially pleased with the added freedom afforded to him by Spike, he later expressed disappointment in the series due to its slow pacing and overuse of toilet humor. Only three episodes aired before Spike&#x27;s entire animation block was &quot;put on hold&quot;, and the complete series was ultimately released in 2006 on DVD including three additional episodes that never aired. Kricfalusi also wanted to release an episode titled &quot;Life Sucks&quot; straight to DVD, but the episode remains unproduced.

===Other projects===

====Collaborations with Fred Seibert====
After leaving &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, Kricfalusi consulted, and other Spümcø animators worked for Donovan Cook&#x27;s &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, which was put into production by Hanna-Barbera president Fred Seibert. The cartoon&#x27;s credits read &quot;Tidbits of Poor Taste Supplied by John Kricfalusi&quot; for the three &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; episodes: &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Red Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Return of Red&quot;. In 1994, Hanna-Barbera and Seibert started production on &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;, also known as &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot; for Cartoon Network. Seibert approached Kricfalusi for advice and for recommendations for personnel to head the shorts, among them David Feiss, Tom Minton, Pat Ventura, and Eddie Fitzgerald.

====Music videos====
Kricfalusi directed Icelandic singer Björk&#x27;s animated music video for the song &quot;I Miss You&quot; in 1997, which features Björk and the character Jimmy the Idiot Boy. Jack Black of Tenacious D approached Kricfalusi to produce a music video for the song &quot;Fuck Her Gently&quot; from their debut album, released in 2001. Black browsed Kricfalusi&#x27;s website and, since both he and his bandmate Kyle Gass held &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; in high regard, he asked Kricfalusi to produce the video. The costs amounted to $40,000. Initially, Sony Music did not allow the video to be placed on Tenacious D&#x27;s website and instead placed it on the record label Grand Royal&#x27;s website, but later relented. In 2006, Kricfalusi directed two music videos, and served as art director for an animated musical segment. The first music video, for &quot;Close but No Cigar&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, was released in September, on the DVD side of the DualDisc album &quot;Straight Outta Lynwood&quot;, which features Kricfalusi&#x27;s character &quot;Cigarettes the Cat&quot;. The second music video was for &quot;Classico&quot; by Tenacious D, starring the band members as cartoon characters. He animated them again in a THX logo parody for the band&#x27;s feature film, &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot;. Kricfalusi served as art director for a musical segment in the show &quot;Class of 3000&quot; entitled &quot;Life Without Music&quot;, which first aired on November 3, 2006. In 2014, he produced art for Miley Cyrus&#x27; Bangerz Tour.

====Internet cartoons and &quot;Hanna-Barbera&quot; shorts====
Venturing into Internet cartoons, Kricfalusi created &quot;Weekend Pussy Hunt&quot; in 1996 for MSN, which was billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first interactive web-based cartoon&quot;. The cartoon, which was released in segments, was scheduled to be completed in June 1997, but production under MSN stopped before it was finished. Production later resumed under Icebox.com after the release of Spümcø&#x27;s own web-based Flash cartoon, &quot;The Goddamn George Liquor Program&quot;. Between 1998 and 2001, Kricfalusi worked on several Hanna-Barbera cartoons for Cartoon Network: three Yogi Bear parody cartoons he directed and animated, &quot;Boo Boo and the Man&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith&quot; and &quot;Boo Boo Runs Wild&quot;, and two &quot;Jetsons&quot; parody cartoons he produced, &quot;The Jetsons: Father &amp; Son Day&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons: The Best Son&quot;.

====Cartoon commentaries, magazines, and other media====
Kricfalusi contributed several articles in 1993 and 1994 for the magazines &quot;Film Threat&quot; and &quot;Wild Cartoon Kingdom&quot; under various aliases. Kricfalusi appears in several bonus featurettes and provides audio commentaries for the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; volumes 2, 3 and 5, for cartoons directed by Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones. On February 13, 2006, Kricfalusi started his own weblog, &quot;John K Stuff&quot;, posting about cartoons and the animation industry. The site was originally intended for other artists and entertainers, and specifically other cartoonists.

====Commercials and freelance work====

Kricfalusi directed commercials for Comcast and Voice over IP company Raketu in 2007. He was developing a series of cartoon commercials in 2008 for Pontiac Vibe starring George Liquor and Jimmy The Idiot Boy, but the series remained unreleased after General Motors discontinued the Pontiac Vibe auto line in 2009. He developed and animated a series of bumpers using Toon Boom Harmony for Adult Swim in 2011 and again in 2015. He animated the opening couch gags of two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts&quot;, which aired in October 2011 and &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVI&quot;, which aired in October 2015. He collaborated with streetwear brand Stüssy to create a short series of apparel based on his designs in 2012, which he promoted with a commercial featuring some of his characters.

The advertising agency Muhtayzik-Hoffer hired Kricfalusi in 2013 for an ad campaign for F&#x27;real milkshakes. He was involved in the early development of many Reel FX projects such as the 2013 film &quot;Free Birds&quot;, a pitch for a film adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book &quot;Happy Birthday to You!&quot; and a pitch for a film he created with Jim Smith. He posted the concepts for these projects on his blog. He partnered with animator Mike Judge to produce a series of shorts for UFC that aired on Adult Swim throughout 2016.

====&quot;Cans Without Labels&quot;====
In 2012, Kricfalusi funded through Kickstarter a cartoon short entitled &quot;Cans Without Labels&quot;, starring the character George Liquor (with Michael Pataki reprising the role for the final time before his death in 2010, having recorded his lines beforehand), with the initial delivery date of February 2013. The cartoon was due to be screened at the 2016 Annecy International Animated Film Festival for the first time; however, at the last minute it was announced that it was not ready. However, on August 6, 2017, the Kickstarter was updated, announcing the film&#x27;s completion. On May 27, 2019, Kricfalusi announced the DVD masterings&#x27; completion and released it on his MyShopify store within a week or two, with backers receiving first priority.

The short received negative reviews for its animation, humor, sound design, storyline and repeatedly delayed production, as well as Kricfalusi&#x27;s decision to release it following the sexual abuse allegations made against him the previous year. However, some praised Pataki&#x27;s voice acting performance.

===Retirement===
In the 2020 documentary &quot;Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story&quot;, Kricfalusi stated in an interview that he was &quot;officially retired&quot; from the animation industry, &quot;though not by choice&quot;.

==Influences==
Kricfalusi says he is mostly self-taught, having only spent a year in Sheridan College, barely attending class. He acquired his skills largely by copying cartoons from newspapers and comic books as a child, and by studying cartoons and their production systems from the 1940s and 1950s.

His main influence is Bob Clampett, and he also names Chuck Jones, Frank Sinatra, Kirk Douglas, Milt Gross, Tex Avery, Peter Lorre, The Three Stooges, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, Don Martin and Robert Ryan.

Michael Barrier, an animation historian, said that Kricfalusi&#x27;s works &quot;testify to his intense admiration for Bob Clampett&#x27;s Warner Bros. cartoons&quot; and that no cartoonist since Clampett created cartoons in which the emotions of the characters &quot;distort their bodies so powerfully&quot;.

==Sexual abuse allegations==

In March 2018, former Spümcø employees Robyn Byrd and Katie Rice told BuzzFeed News that Kricfalusi sexually harassed and groomed them while they were underage. Byrd told the website that she was in a sexual relationship with Kricfalusi in 1997 at age 16, and flew to California to live with him when she was 17. Rice said that Kricfalusi had flirted with her and made overt sexual comments towards her starting when she was 14, and sexually harassed her when she turned 18 and began working at his animation studio, Spümcø.

Documents Rice and Byrd had saved from those years corroborate their stories, and several people who worked with Kricfalusi referred to his sexual harassment as an open secret in the animation industry. Kricfalusi was also reported to possess child pornography on his computer. Though the allegations were eventually reported to the police, they could neither arrest nor investigate Kricfalusi because the statute of limitations had passed.

In response, Kricfalusi&#x27;s lawyer confirmed that &quot;for a brief time, 25 years ago, he had a 16-year-old girlfriend&quot;, but denied that Kricfalusi&#x27;s &quot;avid pursuit&quot; of Rice was sexual harassment or that he had ever possessed child pornography. Kricfalusi released an apology to the women and his fans for his behavior, which he said was motivated by then-undiagnosed bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as &quot;poor impulse control&quot;. Byrd and Rice criticized Kricfalusi&#x27;s statement as a non-apology and an attempt to deflect the blame.

Due to the allegations, Kricfalusi will not be involved in Comedy Central&#x27;s upcoming revival of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, nor will he receive any financial compensation from it.

<text>Lili Anne Taylor (born February 20, 1967) is an American actress. She came to prominence with supporting parts in the films &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; (1988) and &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), before establishing herself as one of the key figures of 1990s independent cinema through starring roles in &quot;Bright Angel&quot; (1990), &quot;Dogfight&quot; (1991), &quot;Household Saints&quot;, &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (both 1993), &quot;The Addiction&quot; (1995), &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, &quot;Girls Town&quot; (both 1996), &quot;Pecker&quot; (1998), and &quot;A Slipping-Down Life&quot; (1999). Taylor is the recipient of four Independent Spirit nominations, winning once in the category of Best Supporting Female. Her other accolades include one Golden Globe Award and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards.

Alongside her work on smaller-scale projects, Taylor has encountered mainstream success with parts in films such as &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989), &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993), &quot;Ransom&quot; (1996), &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1999), &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (2000), &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot;, &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (both 2009), &quot;The Conjuring&quot; (2013), and &quot;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials&quot; (2015). Other credits include &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; (2005), &quot;Starting Out in the Evening&quot; (2007), &quot;The Promotion&quot; (2008), &quot;Being Flynn&quot; (2012), &quot;To the Bone&quot;, &quot;Leatherface&quot; (both 2017), &quot;Eli&quot; (2019), and &quot;Paper Spiders&quot; (2020).

Outside film, Taylor has appeared in television series such as &quot;Almost Human&quot; (2013–2014), &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot; (2013–2014), and &quot;Outer Range&quot; (2022-2024). For her portrayal of Anne Blaine on three seasons of &quot;American Crime&quot; (2015–2017), she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress. She received a further two Emmy nominations for her roles as Marty Glenn on &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1998) and Lisa Kimmel on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2002–2005). Taylor&#x27;s stage credits include Broadway productions of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1997) and Scott McPherson&#x27;s &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (2017). She is married to playwright Nick Flynn, with whom she has a daughter.

==Early life==
Taylor, the fifth of six children, was born in Glencoe, Illinois, a north suburb of Chicago, to Marie (née Lecour) and Park Taylor, an artist and hardware store operator. She grew up in a &quot;warm family environment&quot;, and has described herself as being &quot;a bit of a searcher&quot; during her childhood. She graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois in 1985. Thereafter, she attended The Theatre School at DePaul University before being cut from the acting program for a policy violation, and the Piven Theatre Workshop.

==Career==
Taylor has appeared in dozens of films since 1988, including &quot;Dogfight&quot;, &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;, and &quot;Rudy&quot;. Her work has mostly been in independent films and theater. She played Lisa Kimmel Fisher (mostly in the second and third seasons) in the HBO drama &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award. Taylor played supporting roles in &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; (1988) and &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989). She starred in &quot;Dogfight&quot; (1991) directed by Nancy Savoca, in which she played an unattractive young woman who is taken to a cruel contest by a Marine (played by River Phoenix) under the pretense of a date; in his 1993 book &quot;Alternate Oscars&quot;, Danny Peary argued that Taylor deserved a Best Actress Academy Award for her performance in &quot;Dogfight&quot;. 

In 1991, Taylor played Grace, the witty and romantic step-daughter of Faye Dunaway, in &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (released 1993), directed by Emir Kusturica, co-starring Johnny Depp, Vincent Gallo and Jerry Lewis. In 1993 too, she re-teamed with Savoca for &quot;Household Saints&quot;. Director Robert Altman hired Taylor in 1993 for his epic Los Angeles drama &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, in which Taylor shared scenes with Lily Tomlin. Taylor portrayed Valerie Solanas, who attempted to assassinate Andy Warhol, in Mary Harron&#x27;s &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; (1996). The same year, she co-starred in &quot;Girls Town&quot; with Bruklin Harris and Aunjanue Ellis, where three inner-city friends dealt with a friend&#x27;s suicide, and later in &quot;Ransom&quot;, as caterer who helps her corrupt policeman boyfriend kidnap a rich man&#x27;s son.

In 1998 she appeared in the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. The same year, she appeared in John Waters&#x27; film &quot;Pecker&quot;, alongside Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci and Mary Kay Place. In 1999, Taylor starred in Jan de Bont&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Haunting&quot;. In 2001, Taylor appeared in the independent feature &quot;Julie Johnson&quot;. The film, co-starring Courtney Love, centered on a Long Island mother and housewife who leaves her husband to pursue her dream of studying science. In early 2004, Taylor made her New York City stage debut in Wallace Shawn&#x27;s &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot; in the role of Lemon.

Taylor won the 2005 Best Actress award at the Copenhagen International Film Festival for her role in &quot;Factotum&quot;. In 2006, Taylor worked again with Mary Harron in &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;. She starred in the Lifetime cable network&#x27;s hour-long comedy-drama series &quot;State of Mind&quot;, as a New Haven therapist dealing with a divorce and a parade of quirky clients. She played the daughter of Frank Langella&#x27;s character in Andrew Wagner&#x27;s 2007 drama &quot;Starting Out in the Evening&quot;. In the 2008 film &quot;The Promotion&quot;, Taylor played Lori Wehlner, the wife of John C. Reilly&#x27;s character. In 2009, Taylor played Sheriff Lillian Holley of Lake County, Indiana, who incarcerates John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp), in Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Public Enemies&quot;. In 2011, Fence Books released Taylor&#x27;s audio recording of poet Ariana Reines&#x27; &quot;Save The World&quot;. In 2013, Taylor starred in the horror hit The Conjuring.

In 2014, Taylor starred alongside Chloë Grace Moretz in the off-Broadway play &quot;The Library&quot; directed by Steven Soderbergh. The following year she co-starred in &quot;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials&quot;, as Dr. Mary Cooper, &quot;a doctor who helps Thomas and his fellow Gladers&quot;. Filming began at the end of October, and the movie was released on September 18, 2015. In 2020, Taylor starred opposite Stefania LaVie Owen in &quot;Paper Spiders.&quot;

==Personal life==
In May 1997, Taylor&#x27;s former boyfriend, actor Michael Rapaport, was arrested for harassing Taylor and charged with two counts of aggravated harassment. He pleaded guilty to the charges. New York Supreme Court Justice Arlene Goldberg issued a protection order forbidding him from contacting Taylor and requiring him to undergo counseling.

In 2009, Taylor married writer Nick Flynn. They have a daughter Maeve, who was born sometime around 2008.

Taylor is an activist for conservation issues, particularly those having to do with birds, and sits on the boards of the American Birding Association and National Audubon Society. She introduced Louise Post and Nina Gordon, founding members of 1990s alternative band Veruca Salt, in the early 1990s.

==Awards==
Taylor is a three-time Primetime Emmy Award nominee. Also recognized for her extensive work in American independent film, she has been nominated for four Independent Spirit Awards, winning Best Supporting Female for her performance in &quot;Household Saints&quot; (1993). She was nominated for Best Female Lead for &quot;Bright Angel&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Addiction&quot; (1995), and again for Best Supporting Female for &quot;Girls Town&quot; (1996). In 1996, she received a Special Recognition award from the Sundance Film Festival for her performance in Mary Harron&#x27;s &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, in which she portrayed Valerie Solanas. Ten years later, in 2006, she was honored with the Excellence in Acting Award at the Provincetown International Film Festival.

<doc id="548232" wikidata="Q607893" url="?curid=548232" title="Lesser adjutant">
<text>The lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus) is a large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. Like other members of its genus, it has a bare neck and head. It is however more closely associated with wetland habitats where it is solitary and is less likely to scavenge than the related greater adjutant. It is a widespread species found from India through Southeast Asia.

==Description==

A large stork with an upright stance, a bare head and neck without a pendant pouch, it has a length of (outstretched from bill-to-tail measurement), weighs from and stands about tall. The only confusable species is the greater adjutant, but this species is generally smaller and has a straight upper bill edge (culmen), measuring in length, with a paler base and appears slightly trimmer and less hunch-backed. The skullcap is paler and the upper plumage is uniformly dark, appearing almost all black. The nearly naked head and neck have a few scattered hair-like feathers. The upper shank or tibia is grey rather than pink, the tarsus measures . The belly and undertail are white. Juveniles are a duller version of the adult but have more feathers on the nape. During the breeding season, the face is reddish and the neck is orange. The larger median wing coverts are tipped with copper spots and the inner secondary coverts and tertials have narrow white edging. The wing chord measures in length. Like others in the genus, they retract their necks in flight. In flight, the folded neck can appear like the pouch of the greater adjutant. Males and females appear similar in plumage but males tend to be larger and heavier billed.

==Distribution and habitat==

The lesser adjutant is often found in large rivers and lakes inside well wooded regions, in freshwater wetlands in agricultural areas, and coastal wetlands including mudflats and mangroves. It is found in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh (a colony with about 6 nests and 20 individuals was discovered near Thakurgaon in 2011), Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Singapore, Indonesia and Cambodia. The largest population is in Cambodia. In India they are mainly distributed in the eastern states of Assam, West Bengal and Bihar. It may occur as a vagrant on the southern edge of Bhutan. They are extremely rare in southern India. In Sri Lanka, they are found in lowland areas largely within protected areas, though they also use forested wetlands and crop fields. In Nepal, surveys in eastern districts had suggested that they preferentially use forested patches with small wetlands, largely avoiding crop fields. Additional studies, however, are showing the opposite - breeding densities and breeding success of Lesser Adjutant across lowland Nepal are much higher on croplands.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The lesser adjutant stalks around wetlands feeding mainly on fish, frogs, reptiles, large invertebrates, rodents, small mammals and rarely carrion. Location of prey appears to be entirely visual, with one observation of storks sitting on telegraphic poles apparently scanning a marsh for prey.

They are largely silent but have been noted to clatter their bill, hiss and moan at the nest. During one of the threat displays called the &quot;Arching display&quot; that is given in the presence of intruders, adults extend their neck and sometimes give a hoarse wail.

Courtship behaviour of the lesser adjutant is identical to other species of the genus &quot;Leptoptilos&quot;. During pair formation, female birds lift their heads in a scooping motion with bill-clattering (called the &quot;Balancing Posture&quot;). They are solitary except during the breeding season when they form loose colonies, never exceeding 20 nests in a single colony. The breeding season is February to May in southern India and November to January in north-eastern India, beginning as early as July. In central lowland Nepal, nesting in 2015 began in July, and new colonies continued to be initiated until November. The nest is a large platform of sticks placed on a tall tree. In Nepal, nest initiations started in mid-September continuing until mid-November, with all chicks fledging by late-January. The nest diameter is more than a metre and up to a metre deep. The clutch consists of two to four white eggs that are rapidly soiled during incubation. Incubation period is 28–30 days.

In eastern Nepal, four colonies consisting of 61 nests were all built on the tree species &quot;Haldina cordifolia&quot; and &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;. In central lowland Nepal, 35 colonies with 101 nests were located on four tree species namely &quot;Haldina cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;, &quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot; and &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot; with the majority of colonies located on &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot; trees. Another study the subsequent year across five locations along lowland Nepal monitored 65 colonies with 206 nests from which 280 chicks fledged, and the most frequently used tree species were &quot;B. ceiba&quot;, &quot;H. cordifolia&quot; and &quot;F. religiosa&quot; respectively. Other tree species on which nests have been found in India and Myanmar include &quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot; and &quot;Salmalia malabarica&quot; with some nests located as high as 46 m. Nests have not yet been located in Sri Lanka, though young birds have been observed feeding in crop fields and in freshwater wetlands. The average size of 35 colonies with a total of 101 nests in central, lowland Nepal was 2.9 nests, ranging in size from one nest to 13 nests. Location of colonies in central lowland Nepal was not related to tree density available on the landscape suggesting that nest trees are still adequate here. However, lesser adjutant storks strongly selected non-domestic trees almost entirely, also preferring trees that were much taller and bigger relative to available trees on the landscape. Religious beliefs and agro-forestry practices appear to be responsible for retaining trees that are preferred by lesser adjutants for locating their colonies.

Breeding success in lowland Nepal was positively correlated to colony size, possibly due to reduced predation at colonies. Colony-level breeding success was also impacted by extent of wetlands around colonies, which ameliorated negative impacts of proximity to human habitation. Colonies located on trees in agricultural landscapes of lowland Nepal had a higher breeding success relative to colonies located on trees in forested areas or protected wetland preserves suggesting that current agricultural practices with one season of flooded crops (rice during the monsoon season) followed by winter crops that need some pulsed irrigation (e.g. wheat) are conducive to Lesser Adjutant breeding. Multi-site evaluations showed Lesser Adjutants used cues such as tree height to locate colonies, with taller trees hosting bigger colonies, which in turn resulted in higher fledging success. 

Adult storks took an average of 30 minutes to return to nests with food for nestlings and fledglings, though there was considerable variation in this measure. Time taken to return to nests by adults was impacted by colony size, age of chicks, amount of wetlands around colonies, and the progression of the season. Adults returned faster when brood sizes were higher, but took longer to return as chicks aged. The breeding season in Nepal extended from the middle of the monsoon, when the primary crop on the landscape was flooded rice, to winter, when the cropping was much more mixed and the landscape was much drier. This variation was clearly represented in the changing amount of time it took adults to return to nest after finding food. They returned much faster during the monsoon, but took longer when the crops changed and the landscape dried out suggesting that changing cropping patterns can have serious implications on their ability to raise chicks.

A lesser adjutant paired and hybridized with a painted stork at Dehiwala Zoo, Sri Lanka and at Kuala Lumpur Zoo. The hybrid young had plumage and bill-size of the adjutant, but stance and bill shape of the painted stork.

==Conservation==
The Lesser Adjutants were moved from &quot;Least Concern&quot; to &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in 2020, but this reclassification was based nearly entirely by assumptions that were based on surveys in forested areas. The assumptions asserted that the species was relatively rare, and that it was affected to their detriment by agricultural expansions. Subsequent work in South Asia, that has been far more detailed and nuanced, with analyses covering robust colony-level and landscape-level evaluations, have shown these assumptions to be incorrect and likely part of generic assumptions that appear to be overlaid on all agricultural areas and birds by scientists in developed countries. Like for many other large waterbirds, the south-east Asian populations of Lesser Adjutant storks appear to be greatly at risk due to a combination of hunting and habitat destruction. Subsequently, additional research has shown their population sizes to be much higher than previous estimates that were based on guesses. The assertion that this species was declining rapidly was also found to be incorrect given the high breeding success and large number of breeding colonies documented across lowland Nepal. Subsequently, the conservation status of the species was downlisted to &quot;Near Threatened&quot; to more appropriate reflect evidence.

<text>Russell Investments Group LLC is an American investment firm headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

==Corporate overview==
According to &quot;American Banker&quot;, Russell Investments has approximately $300 billion of assets under management, as of September 2019. The firm ranks as the third largest outsourced CIO (OCIO) provider globally. Additionally, the company has $2.6 trillion under advisement across 32 countries, making Russell Investments the world&#x27;s fourth-largest adviser. The company has an investment outsourcing division to assist clients with investment and retirement portfolios, among other services. Clients have included AT&amp;T, Boeing, and Union Pacific Railroad.

Russell Investments had approximately 1,350 employees, as of late 2019. The majority are based in Seattle, while others work at offices in London, New York City, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto, among other cities.

==History==
Founded by Frank Russell in 1936 in Tacoma, Washington, Russell Investments began as a stockbroker and consultant, and later created the Russell 2000 Index, one of the most followed stock market indices in the U.S. His grandson, George Russell, has been credited with expanding the company and pioneering the business of pension consulting when he secured J. C. Penney as the first pension client.

Northwestern Mutual acquired Russell Investments during 1998–1999 for $1.2 billion. The company&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to Seattle in 2009.

In 2014, London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) acquired the firm for $2.7 billion. Russell Investments had approximately $256 billion in assets under management at the time. LSEG separated the Russell Indexes from other Frank Russell group companies doing business as Russell Investments, such as asset management and consulting, opting to retain the former and sell the latter. LSEG announced the FTSE Russell brand in May 2015.

During 2015–2016, the company was valued at $1.15 billion and purchased by TA Associates, a Boston-based private equity firm, from LSEG. TA hired Goldman Sachs in 2019 to assess Russell Investments&#x27; possible sale.

===Leadership===
George Russell served as chairman until 2002. Craig Ueland was promoted from chief operating officer to president in 2003. He succeeded Mike Phillips, who also served as chairman, as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2004. Ueland was CEO until 2008, when Northwestern Mutual&#x27;s John Schlifske was named president and CEO. Andrew S. Doman began serving as CEO starting in early 2009, and he was succeeded by Len Brennan in 2011. Michelle Seitz became the company&#x27;s first female CEO, and seventh overall, in September 2017. Four months later, she became the chairman as well, serving in both roles until September of 2022. In February 2023, it was announced that Zach Buchwald, then head of BlackRock&#x27;s institutional business, would join Russell as CEO.

<doc id="548236" wikidata="Q446711" url="?curid=548236" title="Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen">
<text>Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen (Friedrich Maria Albrecht Wilhelm Karl; 4 June 1856 – 30 December 1936) was a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and the Supreme Commander of the Imperial and Royal Armed Forces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I, having previously served as both commander-in-chief of the Imperial-Royal Landwehr and inspector-general of the Austro-Hungarian Army.

== Early life ==
Friedrich was born at the castle of Gross Seelowitz in Moravia (today Židlochovice near Brno in the Czech Republic), the son of Karl Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria and his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria.

His siblings included Queen Maria Cristina of Spain, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria, a candidate for the Kingdom of Poland, and Archduke Eugen of Austria, an Austrian officer.

When Friedrich&#x27;s uncle Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen died in 1895, he and his brothers each inherited large estates. Friedrich owned properties at Ungarisch-Altenburg (now Mosonmagyaróvár in Hungary), Belleje, Saybusch (now Żywiec in Poland), Seelowitz (now Židlochovice) and Frýdek in the Czech Republic, and Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia). His Vienna residence, the Palais-Albrecht, housed the Albertina art collection which he owned.

== Marriage ==
On 8 October 1878 Friedrich married at Château de l&#x27;Hermitage in France, Princess Isabella of Croÿ (1856–1931), daughter of Rudolf, Duke of Croÿ, and his wife Princess Natalie of Ligne. They had nine children together.

* Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen (17 November 1879 - 6 August 1962) she married Prince Manuel of Salm-Salm on 10 May 1902. They have four children.
* Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria-Teschen (6 January 1882 - 25 February 1940) she married Elias, Duke of Parma on 25 May 1903. They have eight children. 
* Archduchess Maria Henrietta of Austria-Teschen (10 January 1883 - 2 September 1956) she married Prince Gottfried von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (later Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Germany) on 3 June 1908. They have three children.
* Archduchess Natalie of Austria-Teschen (12 January 1884 - 23 March 1898)
* Archduchess Stephanie of Austria-Teschen (1 May 1886 - 25 August 1890)
* Archduchess Gabriele of Austria-Teschen (14 September 1887 - 15 November 1954)
* Archduchess Isabella of Austria-Teschen (17 November 1888 - 6 December 1973) she married Prince Georg of Bavaria on 10 February 1912 (marriage dissolved). 
* Archduchess Maria Alice of Austria-Teschen (15 January 1893 - 1 July 1962) she married Friedrich Heinrich Carl Maria Baron Waldbott von Bassenheim, son of Friedrich Lothar Baron Waldbott von Bassenheim and Hedwig Baronin von Beust, on 8 May 1920. They have six children. 
* Albrecht Franz, Duke of Teschen (24 July 1897 - 23 July 1955) he married Irene Lelbach on 16 August 1930 and they were divorced on 1 June 1937. He then married Katalin Bocskay de Felsö-Banya on 9 May 1938 and they were divorced in 1951. They had two daughters. He remarried, again, Lydia Strauss-Dorner after 1951. They had one son.

== Military career ==

Like most of the princes of the ruling house, Friedrich adopted a military career, and served creditably for many years as commandant of the V. (Pressburg) Corps. Subsequently, commander-in-chief of the Imperial-Royal Landwehr (militia) and army inspector, he became, after the murder of the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, inspector-general of the Austro-Hungarian Army.

In World War I, he was —from the dynastic point of view —as grandson of the victor of the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Archduke Charles, and as nephew of the victor of the Battle of Custoza, Archduke Albrecht, the predestined head of the armed forces of Austria-Hungary; and on 11 July 1914 Friedrich was appointed supreme commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army by Emperor Franz Joseph I. He thought it his duty to accept this heavy responsibility, but, modestly underestimating his own powers, left the actual exercise of the command to his chief of staff, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf. In the performance of ceremonial duties, and as mediator for the settlement of the conflicting demands of the military, civil and allied elements, his services were undeniable. He was promoted to the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; on 8 December 1914. In February 1917 Emperor Charles I himself took over the supreme command; the Archduke, although the Emperor&#x27;s representative, no longer appeared in the foreground.

== Retirement and death ==
After World War I the governments of Austria and Czechoslovakia confiscated all of Friedrich&#x27;s properties within their borders. These included his palaces in Pressburg and in Vienna and his art collection. He retained his properties in Hungary however. In 1929 he won a court case requiring compensation from the Czechoslovak government.

Friedrich died at Ungarisch-Altenburg (Magyaróvár, now Mosonmagyaróvár) in 1936. His death was the biggest royal event for Hungary since the coronation of King Charles in 1916. The funeral and burial in the parish church in Mosonmagyaróvár was attended by his nephew, the exiled King of Spain; by numerous archdukes; by all the surviving Austro-Hungarian field marshals; by personal representatives of Hitler; by members of the House of Savoy; by the diplomatic corps; by a son of exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm; by representatives of the governments of Germany, Italy and Austria, and by Hungary&#x27;s regent, Miklós Horthy and his wife. There were members of the Hungarian government and delegates of the German and Austrian in attendance as well. Entire battalions of the Royal Hungarian Army were present to pay their last respects to their former supreme commander.

<doc id="548237" wikidata="Q2223519" url="?curid=548237" title="Malted milk">
<text>Malted milk or malt powder or malted milk powder, is a powder made from a mixture of malted barley, wheat flour, and evaporated whole milk powder. The powder is used to add its distinctive flavor to beverages and other foods, but it is also used in baking to help dough cook properly.

==History==
London pharmacist James Horlick developed ideas for an improved, wheat- and malt-based nutritional supplement for infants. Despairing of his opportunities in the United Kingdom, Horlick joined his brother William, who had gone to Racine, Wisconsin, in the United States, to work at a relative&#x27;s quarry. In 1873, the brothers formed J &amp; W Horlicks to manufacture their brand of infant food in nearby Chicago. Ten years later, they earned a patent for a new formula enhanced with dried milk. The company originally marketed its new product as &quot;Diastoid&quot;, but trademarked the name &quot;malted milk&quot; in 1887.

Despite its origins as a health food for infants and invalids, malted milk found unexpected markets. Explorers appreciated its lightweight, nonperishable, nourishing qualities, and they took malted milk on treks worldwide. William Horlick became a patron of Antarctic exploration, and Admiral Richard E. Byrd named Horlick Mountains, a mountain range in Antarctica, after him. Back in the US, people began drinking Horlick&#x27;s new beverage for enjoyment. James Horlick returned to England to import his American-made product and was eventually made a baronet. Malted milk became a standard offering at soda shops, and found greater popularity when mixed with ice cream in a &quot;malt&quot;, for which malt shops were named.

==Uses==
* Malted milk biscuits
* Malted milkshakes
* Malted thickshakes
* Malted soyabean milk
* Malted hot drinks, such as Horlicks and Ovaltine
* Malted milk balls: malted milk is used in the candy confections Whoppers (manufactured by Hershey Co.), Mighty Malts (manufactured by Necco), and Maltesers (manufactured by Mars, Inc). 
* Malted milk is used in some bagel recipes as a substitute for non-diastatic malt powder.

<doc id="548239" wikidata="Q1063617" url="?curid=548239" title="Dogfight (film)">
<text>Dogfight is a 1991 period coming-of-age drama film set in San Francisco, California, during the 1960s and directed by Nancy Savoca. The film explores the love between an 18-year-old Marine, Lance Corporal Eddie Birdlace (River Phoenix), on his way to Vietnam, and a young woman, Rose Fenny (Lili Taylor).

==Plot==

The film begins on November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Lance Corporal Birdlace and three of his Marine buddies have arrived in San Francisco for a twenty-four hour leave before shipping off to Okinawa, and are planning on attending a &quot;dogfight&quot; later that evening, a party at which Marines compete to bring the ugliest date, unbeknownst to the girls. They separate to look for dates. After a few women reject his advances, Birdlace ducks into a coffee shop, where he encounters Rose, a waitress, on her break, practicing on her guitar. She is not particularly ugly, but rather plain, shy and awkward. Birdlace attempts to charm her, complimenting her on her guitar playing, and invites her to a party. She is suspicious of his motives, but decides to accept his invitation.

While walking to the bar where the dogfight is to be held, Birdlace begins to have second thoughts about playing such a cruel trick on Rose after realizing she&#x27;s not ugly enough to compete, and attempts to talk her out of going in. However, when they encounter one of Birdlace&#x27;s buddies and his date in front of the bar, he has no choice but to proceed inside with Rose. Birdlace proceeds to get drunk, presumably feeling guilty. Shortly after, Rose convinces Birdlace to dance with her, though at first he resists because he knows the dance floor is where the dates will be judged. The alcohol and dancing eventually make Rose feel dizzy, and she rushes off to be sick in the rest room. Marcie, the date brought by Birdlace&#x27;s friend Berzin, is declared the winner. In the ladies&#x27; room, it is revealed that Marcie is actually a prostitute whom Berzin has hired, in violation of the rules of the dogfight, cluing Rose in to the true nature of the party. Rose is devastated and tears into Birdlace, then storms off. Birdlace immediately regrets having treated Rose so cruelly, and chases after her. He convinces her to let him buy her dinner in an attempt to make it up to her.

After dinner, the two walk to a club where Rose hopes to perform soon, and then to an arcade. Birdlace is surprised to find himself enjoying spending time with Rose, so much so that he forgets that he was to have met up with his three buddies at a tattoo parlor to get matching tattoos to solidify their friendship. Rose tells Birdlace about her dream of becoming a folk singer, and he reveals to her that he will be shipping off to Okinawa the following day, and from there on to &quot;a little country called Vietnam,&quot; he hopes. She offers to write to him, and asks if he will write back. Birdlace walks Rose home, and they share an awkward moment on her doorstep before she hesitantly invites him in. They attempt to talk, but end up having a self-conscious yet tender sexual encounter.

As he is leaving at dawn, Rose gives him her address and asks him to write. Birdlace meets up with his buddies as they board their bus. Birdlace makes up a story about not showing up because he spent the night with the beautiful wife of an officer. Berzin later shares with Birdlace that he saw him with Rose; Birdlace counters that he is aware that Berzin&#x27;s date, Marcie, was actually a prostitute. They agree to keep one another&#x27;s secrets, as Birdlace tears up Rose&#x27;s address and throws it out the window of the bus.

The next day, Rose weeps and watches coverage of President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on TV with her mother. Later, in 1966, Birdlace and his three friends have been deployed to Chu Lai, South Vietnam. While playing cards, they are suddenly hit with a mortar, and chaos ensues; Birdlace is wounded in the leg, and Berzin and Oakie drag him away and tell him that Benjamin is dead, before another mortar round hits.

A year later, Birdlace gets off a Greyhound bus in San Francisco. Discharged from the Marines, he now walks with a limp, and it is suggested that his three friends were all killed in combat. He is taken aback by how much things have changed since he was last there, with hippies and flower children everywhere. He walks to the neighborhood where Rose&#x27;s coffee shop is, and goes to a bar across the street to have a drink. The bartender tells him that Rose&#x27;s mother has turned the coffee shop over to Rose. Birdlace makes his way across the street and into the coffee shop. Rose, not having heard from him in three years, is surprised to see him, and can only say &quot;hi&quot;. She goes over to him, and they embrace.

==Release==
The premiere of &quot;Dogfight&quot; was a screening at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on August 30, 1991 with a New York premiere on September 13, 1991. It also had an opening in Los Angeles on September 27, 1991. It was released in the United States on October 4, 1991, by Warner Bros.

===Home media===
&quot;Dogfight&quot; was released by Criterion on Blu-ray in the United States on April 30, 2024 and in the UK on May 6, 2024. Previously it had been released on DVD. The Blu-ray release includes interviews with Savoca and actor Lili Taylor, a trailer and an audio commentary with Savoca and producer Richard Guay.

==Reception==
The film received praise from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an 83% approval rating based on 24 reviews. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&#x27;Dogfight&#x27; is two characters in search of a film. And very fine characters they happen to be, as winsome a pair of young people as anyone would ever want to meet. Which makes it all the more a wonder that their on-screen adventures can’t seem to go anywhere at all.&quot; Roger Ebert remarked that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t a love story so much as a story about how a young woman helps a confused teenage boy to discover his own better nature. The fact that his discoveries take place on the night before he ships out to fight the war in Vietnam only makes the story more poignant.&quot;

In a mixed review, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Dogfight&quot; doesn’t sum up an era; it merely romanticizes it. What could have been an incisive movie about alienation deteriorates into a conventional romance.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Dogfight&quot;... seems to have no clear idea of what these ordinary people are really like. The film wants to be honest (and in its cruelties, it is), but the operative sensibility is that of a sitcom world. The characters aren&#x27;t necessarily idealized, but they are flat and uninteresting. The material is lugubrious. The only seemingly spontaneous moment comes at the very end, which is too late.&quot; Dustin Putman referred to the film as &quot;a virtually unknown gem&quot; and &quot;one of the sweetest, most touching romances of the decade.&quot;

The film&#x27;s soundtrack featured a number of prominent 1960s artists, including Muddy Waters, The Weavers, Van Morrison, Elizabeth Cotten, Pete Seeger and Malvina Reynolds.

==Musical adaptation==
In June 2012, Second Stage Theatre debuted the musical adaptation. The show, which features music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and a book by Peter Duchan, was directed by Joe Mantello and choreographed by Christopher Gattelli. It starred Lindsay Mendez as Rose and Derek Klena as Eddie. The cast also included Nick Blaemire, Annaleigh Ashford, Steven Booth, Becca Ayers, Adam Halpin, Dierdre Friel, F. Michael Haynie, James Moye and Josh Segarra. David Zinn designed sets and costumes and Paul Gallo designed the lights. The production opened on July 16, 2012, after previews from June 27, and concluded its limited run on August 19. The show received rave reviews for its young writers and for leading lady Lindsay Mendez&#x27;s tour de force performance.

&quot;Dogfight&quot; earned two 2013 Lucille Lortel Awards for Outstanding Musical and Outstanding Choreographer (Christopher Gattelli). It was nominated for five 2013 Outer Critics Circle Awards: Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical, Outstanding New Score (Broadway or Off-Broadway), Outstanding Book of a Musical (Broadway or Off-Broadway), Outstanding Actress in a Musical (Lindsay Mendez), and Outstanding Lighting Design (Paul Gallo).

<doc id="548242" wikidata="Q295948" url="?curid=548242" title="Brian Johnson">
<text>Brian Johnson (born 5 October 1947) is an English singer and songwriter. In 1980 at the age of 32, after the death of Bon Scott, he became the third lead singer of the Australian rock band AC/DC. 

Johnson was one of the founding members of the rock band Geordie, which was formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1971. After several hit singles, including the UK Top 10 hit &quot;All Because of You&quot; (1973), the band split in 1978. Following the death of Bon Scott on 19 February 1980, Johnson was asked to audition for AC/DC, whose guitarists and founders Angus and Malcolm Young remembered when Scott had been impressed with Johnson as Geordie&#x27;s frontman. Johnson&#x27;s first album with AC/DC, &quot;Back in Black&quot;, became the second-best-selling album of all time, according to most estimates. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the successful transition to Johnson at No. 36 on their list of 50 key events in rock-music history.

Johnson and the rest of the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. In March 2016, he temporarily left the band during the Rock or Bust World Tour because of hearing problems. In September 2020, AC/DC confirmed that Johnson, along with bandmates Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams, had rejoined the group in August 2018 to record the album &quot;Power Up&quot;.

Johnson is known for his distinctive singing voice and strong Geordie accent. In July 2014, he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music by Northumbria University in Newcastle in recognition of his significant contribution to the music industry.

==Early life==
Johnson was born on 5 October 1947 in Dunston, County Durham. He is the oldest of four siblings. His English father, Alan, was a coal miner and sergeant major in the British Army&#x27;s Durham Light Infantry who died in 1996. His Italian mother, Esther (&quot;née&quot; De Luca), was from Rocca di Papa. When he was young, Johnson performed in various shows with the Scouts, appeared in a play which aired on television, and joined a local church choir. He served in the Territorial Army with the 17th Parachute Battalion in Germany for two years.

==Career==
===Early career===
Johnson&#x27;s first band was the Gobi Desert Canoe Club. He was also in a band called Fresh. From 1970, Johnson played with cabaret/club band the Jasper Hart Band, performing songs from the musical &quot;Hair&quot; as well as soft-rock/pop songs of the time. He and other members of the band formed Geordie.

Johnson released his first and only solo single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget You Now&quot;, as a member of Geordie in January 1976 on the Red Bus label. In 1982, a compilation including ten of Geordie&#x27;s 1973–1976 songs, was issued as Brian Johnson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Strange Man&quot; on the MCA label. The U.S. 1989 CD &quot;Keep On Rocking&quot;, with re-recorded versions of the band&#x27;s twelve known songs, was released under the name of Brian Johnson and Geordie as well as the Australian 1991 compilation CD &quot;Rockin&#x27; With The Boys 1972–1976&quot;.

===AC/DC===

Following Bon Scott&#x27;s death, the remaining members of the band briefly considered quitting, before concluding that Scott would have wanted AC/DC to continue. Various candidates were considered for his successor, including ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser and Slade&#x27;s Noddy Holder, who declined, before selecting Johnson. AC/DC guitarist and co-founder Angus Young later recalled, &quot;I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian&#x27;s (Johnson) name was from Bon&quot;.

Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said &#x27;Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.&#x27; And that was Bon&#x27;s big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was &#x27;Well he&#x27;s a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.&#x27; He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him.&quot; 

The band agreed immediately that Johnson&#x27;s performing style fit AC/DC&#x27;s music. In March 1980 Johnson received a phone call inviting him to London to audition as the new vocalist for AC/DC. As a big AC/DC fan, he was happy to oblige. Malcolm remembers the day: &quot;We were all sitting there going, Where&#x27;s this guy Brian? He should have been here an hour ago. &#x27;Oh him? He&#x27;s downstairs playing pool with the roadies&#x27; – so we thought, well, at least he plays pool.&quot;

When someone fetched him to meet them, Malcolm recalls that Johnson, &quot;had tears in his eyes. He was as sad about Bon as we were. Anyway, we said, Do you want to give it a go? And he said, &#x27;I do &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; with Geordie,&#x27; and off he went. We went, this guy is cutting the mustard. Anything else you know? &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;? OK, we can knock that out, and he sang that great too. It put a little smile on our faces – for the first time since Bon. So we just started working with him then.&quot;

Within days, Johnson was in the band, the news being made official on 1 April. A week after that he was sent a plane ticket to the Bahamas, their management&#x27;s idea, partly for tax purposes and partly because there were no vacant studios in the UK, where he joined the Youngs, bassist Cliff Williams, drummer Phil Rudd and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; producer Mutt Lange in Compass Point Studios.

The result was the album &quot;Back in Black&quot;, which was released in July that year. It was a worldwide success and went on to become the second-best-selling album of all time. In 1986, Johnson returned to Tyneside and appeared in the music video for &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, and the video received significant airplay on MTV.
The 1988 album &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; was the last AC/DC album to feature lyrics from Johnson. Starting with &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; in 1990, guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young have written all of AC/DC&#x27;s material. When asked by a fan during a radio interview why he stopped contributing lyrics, he laughed, &quot;I ran out of words&quot; and went on to explain that during recording he did not always enjoy the pressure of having to come up with an album&#x27;s worth of lyrics and was relieved when the Young brothers filled in during &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;. The band has since continued in that tradition for every album since.

A symbol of the working class in the north of England, Johnson customarily wears a newsboy cap on stage and frequently off. Johnson has occasionally worn baseball caps as well. His brother suggested that the singer wear the cap onstage to prevent sweat rolling off his thick, curly hair into his eyes while singing. &quot;He said, &#x27;Put it on, at least you&#x27;ll be able to see what the bloody freak you&#x27;re doing!&#x27; So I put it on and after three songs in the second set, I looked at him, put my thumbs up – &#x27;This is brilliant!&#x27; He never did get that hat back.&quot;

In April 2016, during the Rock or Bust World Tour, AC/DC announced the departure of Johnson, citing hearing issues. As the band explained it, Johnson risked total hearing loss if he continued. Johnson stated that his hearing issues hadn&#x27;t come from performing for 36 years with AC/DC, but from having forgotten to put ear plugs in during a race that left him with a punctured left ear drum. Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose was recruited to complete the remaining ten shows in North America and twelve shows in Europe. 

Johnson&#x27;s last show with AC/DC was on 28 February 2016, at the Sprint Center in Kansas City. He stated in an interview that he &quot;had a pretty good run&quot; in AC/DC and implied that he might not be returning. After departing AC/DC, he recorded a new song with comedian Jim Breuer called &quot;Mr. Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Johnson made a cameo appearance with rock band Muse on 31 August 2017, performing a rendition of &quot;Back in Black&quot; with the group.

In August 2018, rumours began circulating that Johnson and drummer Phil Rudd had rejoined AC/DC. According to members of the band Terrorizer, in January 2019 Johnson confirmed to them that he was back in AC/DC after getting &quot;sick of denying it&quot; and that he was working on a new album.

On 30 September 2020, AC/DC posted a photo on social media listing the band&#x27;s new line-up, including Johnson on vocals, as well as a photo featuring, him, Angus, Cliff Williams, Phil Rudd and Stevie Young reunited.

In November 2020, AC/DC released a new album - Power Up - with Johnson on vocals.

On 7 October 2023, Johnson made a triumphant return to the stage with AC/DC at the Power Trip festival, the bands first show since 2016, when they completed the Rock or Bust World Tour with Axl Rose filling in for Johnson. He is currently touring with the band on their Power Up Tour.

===&quot;Helen of Troy&quot; musical===
Since April 2003, Johnson, who says &quot;I love musical theatre, especially the classic stuff, like Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot;, has been working on a musical version of &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; with Sarasota Ballet choreographer, Robert de Warren. The musical is a &quot;Les Misérables&quot;-style musical with rousing anthems, tender ballads and minimal dialogue. He conceived the project with writers Ian La Frenais, Dick Clement, and Brendan Healy after seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Cats&quot; and being underwhelmed at what he saw.

Malcolm McDowell, who made his recording debut singing one of the songs for the soundtrack in Brian&#x27;s studio, agreed to play Zeus. The Cranberries singer Dolores O&#x27;Riordan and Bruce Vilanch were also set to participate. In 2004, Johnson travelled to Greece to film an episode of the television series &quot;Goddess Odyssey&quot; in which he researched the Helen of Troy myth. It was released on DVD in July 2005 and contains music from the theatre production. Phil Carson, former chief executive of Atlantic Records, supported the project but it was never staged.

===Other activities===
A car and racing enthusiast, Johnson currently enjoys racing his vintage race cars: a Royale RP-4 and a Pilbeam MP84, which he races in vintage and historic races throughout the United States. In 1997, Johnson recorded with the band Jackyl on their song &quot;Locked and Loaded&quot;, and in 2002, wrote lyrics on the track &quot;Kill the Sunshine&quot; from their album &quot;Relentless&quot;. In the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Finest Hour&quot;, he voiced Sergeant Bob Starkey. He based his performance on his father. He made a cameo appearance in the 2005 film &quot;Goal!&quot; where he appears as a Newcastle United fan in a bar in California watching a Newcastle game.

In 2006, he took part in car racing reality television series &quot;The Race&quot;, broadcast on Sky One in the UK. In 2007, Johnson and AC/DC bassist Cliff Williams took part in the Classic Rock Cares tour to raise funds for the John Entwistle Foundation, which is run by Entwistle&#x27;s long-time friend and drummer Steve Luongo. They performed AC/DC songs as well as songs written by Johnson for the film &quot;Totally Baked&quot;.

On 26 July 2009, Johnson appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;. His time of 1:45.9 tied him with &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; judge Simon Cowell and &quot;Grand Designs&quot; host Kevin McCloud for the second-fastest time in the Chevrolet Lacetti, just 0.1 seconds behind Jay Kay. Johnson subsequently appeared in the premiere of &quot;Top Gear&quot; series 20 and was the first star to record a time in their new Vauxhall Astra test vehicle, recording a time of 1:45.1. In April 2015, Johnson stated it was a mistake for the BBC to sack Jeremy Clarkson after the &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter punched a colleague: &quot;I know Jeremy and I know the lads [Richard Hammond and James May] and it&#x27;s [the punch] just totally out of character.&quot;

His autobiography &quot;Rockers and Rollers&quot; was published in 2000. He raced in the 2012 Rolex 24 at Daytona on 29 and 30 January 2012. He finished 12th in the Daytona Prototype class, driving for 50+Predator/Alegra Racing, sharing the #50 RileyTech/BMW Daytona Prototype with Elliott Forbes-Robinson, Byron DeFoor, Jim Pace, and Carlos de Quesada. He competed in the 2012 Silverstone Classic Celebrity Challenge race. In 2013, Johnson appeared as a guest singer on two songs on Sting&#x27;s album &quot;The Last Ship&quot; which features artists with roots in the northeast of England.

In May 2014, Quest broadcast &quot;Cars That Rock with Brian Johnson&quot;, a documentary series fronted by Johnson where he explores his favourite iconic motor cars. The first episode looks at the history of the Mini, with Johnson driving a big selection of the cars, including the car from the 1969 British caper film &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and the world&#x27;s fastest Mini. It concludes with Johnson racing a Mini Cooper at Brands Hatch, and finishes with him stating he has bought the car he raced. As of 2016, the show can now be seen on the Velocity channel.

In April 2017, Sky Arts broadcast the first episode of &quot;Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road&quot;. Series 1 comprised six episodes, with Johnson meeting contemporaries in the music industry to talk about their musical upbringings and careers. Featured were Roger Daltrey (The Who), Lars Ulrich (Metallica), Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Sting (The Police), Joe Elliott (Def Leppard), and Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin). Series 2 was released in 2019 featuring Dolly Parton, Billy Joel, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits), Mick Fleetwood (Fleetwood Mac), Joe Walsh (James Gang, The Eagles), and Paul Rodgers (Free, Bad Company).

On 3 September 2022, Johnson took to the stage at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert and performed &quot;Back in Black&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; with Metallica drummer, Lars Ulrich and the Foo Fighters. Johnson&#x27;s memoirs, entitled &quot;The Lives of Brian&quot;, was published by HarperCollins and released on 25 October 2022.

==Personal life==
Johnson married his first wife, Carol, in 1968, and they have two daughters. They divorced during the writing of &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; album. He is now married to Brenda, and lives in Sarasota, Florida, US.

He is an avid supporter of Newcastle United F.C. and was asked to invest in the club in the early 1980s after being invited to meet the board by club legend Jackie Milburn.

In September 2009, Johnson was diagnosed with Barrett syndrome, causing AC/DC to cancel several shows on their 2010 tour in support of &quot;Black Ice&quot;. However, doctors were able to prevent the disease from developing into cancer.

According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List of British millionaires in music, Johnson was worth £65 million in 2016.

On 9 July 2014, Johnson was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music by Northumbria University in recognition of his significant contribution to the music industry. In October 2014, he became a supporter of the Yorkshire Dementia Charity based in the village of Topcliffe.

<text>Giacomo Pylarini or Jacobus Pylarinus or Iacob Pylarino (Greek: Ιάκωβος Πυλαρινός; 1659–1718) was a Greek physician and consul for the republic of Venice in Smyrna. In 1715 he became the first person to have an account of the practice of inoculation published by the Royal Society.

He studied law and then medicine at the University of Padua before qualifying as a physician. He travelled to different parts of Asia and Africa and practised both at Smyrna and Constantinople. In Moscow he was appointed physician to the Russian Tsar Peter the Great.

He returned to Smyrna for the second time and resided there as the Venetian Consul as well as practising physician.

Together with another Greek doctor called Emmanuel Timoni, he introduced variolation to Western Europe through their writing from Constantinople.

<text>A luthier ( ; ) is a craftsperson who builds or repairs string instruments.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is originally French and comes from &quot;luth&quot;, the French word for &quot;lute&quot;. The term was originally used for makers of lutes, but it came to be used in French for makers of most bowed and plucked stringed instruments such as members of the violin family (including violas, cellos, and double basses) and guitars. Luthiers, however, do not make harps or pianos; these require different skills and construction methods because their strings are secured to a frame.

==Craft==
The craft of luthiers, lutherie (rarely called &quot;luthiery&quot;, but this often refers to stringed instruments other than those in the violin family), is commonly divided into the two main categories of makers of stringed instruments that are plucked or strummed and makers of stringed instruments that are bowed. Since bowed instruments require a bow, the second category includes a subtype known as a bow maker or archetier. Luthiers may also teach string-instrument making, either through apprenticeship or formal classroom instruction.

== Plucked strings ==

=== Lutes ===

Early producers of lutes, archlutes, theorbos and vihuelas include the Tieffenbrucker family, Martin Hoffmann and Matteo Sellas.

=== Guitars ===


Two luthiers of the early 19th century connected with the development of the modern classical guitar are Louis Panormo and Georg Staufer. Antonio Torres Jurado is credited with developing the form of classical guitar still in use. C.F. Martin of Germany developed a form that evolved into the modern steel-string acoustic guitar.
The American luthier Orville Gibson specialized in mandolins, and is credited with creating the archtop guitar. The 20th-century American luthiers John D&#x27;Angelico and Jimmy D&#x27;Aquisto made archtop guitars. Lloyd Loar worked briefly for the Gibson Guitar Corporation making mandolins and guitars. His designs for a family of arch top instruments (mandolin, mandola, guitar, et cetera) are held in high esteem by today&#x27;s luthiers, who seek to reproduce their sound. C. F. Martin apprenticed to Johann Georg Stauffer, a guitar maker in Vienna, Austria and Martin &amp; Co. was born, with the X bracing being developed in the 1850s. Martin &amp; Co still produce acoustic guitars. Paul Bigsby&#x27;s innovation of the tremolo arm for archtop and electric guitars is still in use and may have influenced Leo Fender&#x27;s design for the Stratocaster solid-body electric guitar, as well as the Jaguar and Jazzmaster. Concurrent with Fender&#x27;s work, guitarist Les Paul independently developed a solid-body electric guitar. These were the first fretted, solid-body electric guitars—though they were preceded by the cast aluminum &quot;frying pan&quot;, a solid-body electric lap steel guitar developed and eventually patented by George Beauchamp, and built by Adolph Rickenbacher.
A company founded by luthier Friedrich Gretsch and continued by his son and grandson, Fred and Fred, Jr., originally made banjos, but now mainly produce electric guitars.

== Bowed strings ==


Bowed instruments include: cello, crwth, double bass, erhu, fiddle, hudok, morin khuur, nyckelharpa, hurdy-gurdy, rabab, rebec, sarangi, viol (viola da gamba), viola, viola da braccio, viola d&#x27;amore, and violin.

The purported inventor of the violin is Andrea Amati. Amati was originally a lute maker, but turned to the new instrument form of violin in the mid-16th century. He was the progenitor of the Amati family of luthiers active in Cremona, Italy until the 18th century. Andrea Amati had two sons. His eldest was Antonio Amati (&quot;circa&quot; 1537–1607), and the younger, Girolamo Amati (&quot;circa&quot; 1561–1630). Girolamo is better known as Hieronymus, and together with his brother, produced many violins with labels inside the instrument reading &quot;A&amp;H&quot;. Antonio died having no known offspring, but Hieronymus became a father. His son Nicolò (1596–1684) was himself a master luthier who had several apprentices of note, including Antonio Stradivari (probably), Andrea Guarneri, Bartolomeo Pasta, Jacob Railich, Giovanni Battista Rogeri, Matthias Klotz, and possibly Jacob Stainer and Francesco Rugeri. It is even possible Bartolomeo Cristofori, later inventor of the piano, apprenticed under him (although census data does not support this, which paints this as a possible myth).

Gasparo Duiffopruggar of Füssen, Germany, was once incorrectly credited as the inventor of the violin. He was likely a maker, but no documentation survives, and no instruments survive that experts unequivocally know are his.

Gasparo da Salò of Brescia (Italy) was another early luthier of the violin family. About 80 of his instruments survive, and around 100 documents that relate to his work. He was also a double bass player and son and nephew of two violin players: Francesco and Agosti, respectively.

Da Salò made many instruments and exported to France and Spain, and probably to England. He had at least five apprentices: his son Francesco, a helper named Battista, Alexander of Marsiglia, Giacomo Lafranchini and Giovanni Paolo Maggini. Maggini inherited da Salò&#x27;s business in Brescia. Valentino Siani worked with Maggini. In 1620, Maggini moved to Florence.

===By century===
====17th====
Luthiers born in the mid-17th century include Giovanni Grancino, Vincenzo Rugeri, Carlo Giuseppe Testore, and his sons Carlo Antonio Testore and Paolo Antonio Testore, all from Milan. From Venice the luthiers Matteo Goffriller, Domenico Montagnana, Sanctus Seraphin, and Carlo Annibale Tononi were principals in the Venetian school of violin making (although the latter began his career in Bologna). Carlo Bergonzi (luthier) purchased Antonio Stradivari&#x27;s shop a few years after the master&#x27;s death. David Tecchler, who was born in Austria, later worked in both Venice and Rome.

====18th====
Luthiers from the early 18th century include Nicolò Gagliano of Naples, Italy, Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi of Milan, and Giovanni Battista Guadagnini, who roamed throughout Italy during his lifetime. From Austria originally, Leopold Widhalm later established himself in Nürnberg, Germany.

The Jérôme-Thibouville-Lamy firm started making wind instruments around 1730 at La Couture-Boussey, then moved to Mirecourt around 1760 and started making violins, guitars, mandolins, and musical accessories.

====19th====
The early 19th-century luthiers of the Mirecourt school of violin making in France were the Vuillaume family, Charles Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin, and Collin-Mezin&#x27;s son, Charles Collin-Mezin, Jr., Honore Derazey, Nicolas Lupot, Charles Macoutel, Charles Mennégand, and Pierre Silvestre.
Nicola Utili (also known as Nicola da Castel Bolognese) (Ravenna, Italy, 1888–1962), beside traditional lute works, experimented the making of &quot;pear-shaped&quot; violins.

<doc id="548248" wikidata="Q60504" url="?curid=548248" title="Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg">
<text>Albrecht, Duke and Crown Prince of Württemberg (Albrecht Maria Alexander Philipp Joseph; 23 December 1865 – 31 October 1939) was the last crown prince of the Kingdom of Württemberg, a German military commander of World War I, and the head of the House of Württemberg from 1921 to his death.

== Early life ==
Duke Albrecht was born in Vienna as the eldest child of Duke Philipp of Württemberg and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, daughter of Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen.

Albrecht entered the armies of the Kingdom of Württemberg and the German Empire in 1883, rose quickly through its ranks, and became the heir apparent to the throne of Württemberg.

In 1910, Albrecht attended the funeral of Edward VII. He was a third cousin of Mary of Teck, who was the Queen consort of George V.

== World War I ==
When World War I began, Duke Albrecht&#x27;s command, the Six Army Inspectorate (&quot;Sechste Armee-Inspektion&quot;), was formed into the 4th Army, 123 battalions strong. As King William II had no sons, Albrecht was appointed the army&#x27;s commander and assigned to the Ardennes, with Walther von Lüttwitz serving as his chief of staff. This army he led to victory alongside Crown Prince Wilhelm&#x27;s 5th Army at the Battle of the Ardennes in August 1914. Following that victory, the 4th Army saw action in the First Battle of the Marne before being transferred to Flanders in October, where Albrecht commanded them during the Battle of the Yser. Albrecht also commanded the German forces during the Second Battle of Ypres, where poison gas was used on a large scale for the first time.

Albrecht was awarded the Pour le Mérite in August 1915 and promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in August 1916. The new Army Group Duke Albrecht was placed under his command in February 1917, and he was responsible for the southern sector of the Western Front until the Armistice.

== Postwar ==
Albrecht had become heir presumptive to the Kingdom of Württemberg following the death of his father in October 1917, but the German Empire&#x27;s World War I defeat and the abdication of his cousin King Willhelm II of Württemberg following the German Revolution prevented him from ever succeeding to the throne. He became head of the House of Württemberg after the death of Wilhelm on 2 October 1921.

Albrecht died at Altshausen Castle. His son Duke Philipp Albrecht succeeded him as head of the House of Württemberg.

== Family ==

Albrecht was married in Vienna on 24 January 1893 to Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria, a daughter of Archduke Carl Ludwig. They had seven children:
* Philipp Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg (1893–1975).
* Duke Albrecht Eugen of Württemberg (born 8 January 1895 in Stuttgart; died 24 June 1954 in Schwäbisch Gmünd), who married Princess Nadezhda of Bulgaria (1899–1958), daughter of Tsar Ferdinand I. They had five children.
* Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg (born 12 March 1896 in Stuttgart; died 27 December 1964 in Altshausen), a Benedictine monk known as &quot;Father Odo&quot;.
* Duchess Maria &quot;Amalia&quot; of Württemberg (born 15 August 1897 in Gmunden; died 13 August 1923 in Altshausen), briefly engaged to Crown Prince George of Saxony.
* Duchess Maria &quot;Theresa&quot; of Württemberg (born 16 August 1898 in Stuttgart; died 26 March 1928 in Eibingen).
* Duchess Maria &quot;Elisabeth&quot; of Württemberg (born 12 September 1899 in Potsdam; died 15 April 1900 in Meran).
* Duchess Margarita Maria of Württemberg (born 4 January 1902 in Stuttgart; died 22 April 1945 in Altshausen).

<text>The 1999 Salt Lake City tornado was a rare tornado that struck downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, on August 11, 1999. It was among the most notable tornadoes to hit west of the Great Plains in the 20th century and the second tornado to hit in Utah that resulted in a fatality (the other occurring in 1884). This was the sixth significant tornado in Utah since June 1963, and one of only two F2 tornadoes to have hit Salt Lake County since 1950 (the other occurring on February 9, 1965, in Magna).

==Meteorological synopsis==
In Salt Lake Valley, the day began with calm but cloudy weather. As the day progressed, the clouds became steadily darker until nearly all light was obscured. Winds were still nearly calm, with the exception of a few microbursts. Hail preceded and followed this tornado, which was rated a strong F2 on the Fujita scale. At 12:41 p.m., diameter hail was reported near the town of Herriman. Afterwards, the storm started rotating, and at around 1:00 pm, many people reported seeing the storm rotate as it moved into downtown Salt Lake City. A non-descending funnel cloud developed and traveled from western downtown toward the northeast before terminating near Memory Grove Park upon reaching the base of the Wasatch Mountains. The tornado remained on the ground for about 14 minutes over the span of about .

==Damage==

The tornado damaged or destroyed approximately 800–1,000 trees and destroyed temporary tents set up for the Outdoor Retailers Association convention, claiming the life of one booth set-up supervisor, Allen Crandy, 38, of Las Vegas. In The Avenues, over 154 homes were severely damaged, about 120 of which had roofs blown off. Over 100 people were reported injured and a dozen critically. In total, 300 buildings were damaged or destroyed.

At the Delta Center, home of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association, the tornado shattered windows and tore off part of the roof. Almost all of the windows from the nearby Wyndham Hotel (now the Radisson Hotel), across the street from the temporary tents, were broken out, raining down shards of glass on people attempting to escape from the collapsed tents. A crane toppled at the LDS Conference Center that was under construction. Damage to historic buildings in the lower Capitol Hill area of Salt Lake was reported. Nearly all of the trees in Memory Grove, a World War I memorial park at the mouth of City Creek Canyon near downtown, were reportedly torn out, as well as hundreds of old trees on the Capitol grounds.

This was the first major tornado to occur in a large urban area&#x27;s downtown district and strike buildings of nearly tall, according to Bill Alder of the National Weather Service. It happened in an area of the U.S. where tornadoes of this strength are relatively rare. The tornado caused approximately $170 million in damage.

<doc id="548251" wikidata="Q2032468" url="?curid=548251" title="Usonia">
<text>Usonia () is a term that was used by the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright to refer to the United States in general (in preference over &quot;America&quot;), and more specifically to his vision for the landscape of the country, including the planning of cities and the architecture of buildings. Wright proposed the use of the adjective &quot;Usonian&quot; to describe the particular New World character of the American landscape as distinct and free of previous architectural conventions.

==Usonian houses==

&quot;Usonian&quot; usually refers to a group of approximately 60 middle-income family homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright beginning in 1934 with the Willey House, with most considering the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House, 1937, to be the first true &quot;Usonian.&quot; The &quot;Usonian Homes&quot; are typically small, single-story dwellings without a garage or much storage. They are often L-shaped to fit around a garden terrace on unusual and inexpensive sites. They are characterized by native materials; flat roofs and large cantilevered overhangs for passive solar heating and natural cooling; natural lighting with clerestory windows; and radiant-floor heating. Another distinctive feature is that they typically have little exposure to the front/&#x27;public&#x27; side, while the rear/&#x27;private&#x27; sides are completely open to the outside. A strong visual connection between the interior and exterior spaces is an important characteristic of all Usonian homes. The word carport was coined by Wright to describe an overhang for sheltering a parked vehicle.

The Usonia Historic District is a planned community in Pleasantville, New York built in the 1950s following this concept. Wright designed three of the 47 homes himself.

Variants of the Jacobs House design are still in existence today. The Usonian design is considered among the aesthetic origins of the ranch-style house popular in the American west of the 1950s.

===The FSC Usonian House===
In 2013, Florida Southern College constructed a building it has named the &quot;Usonian House&quot;, according to plans that Wright created in 1939 in an original design for one of twenty faculty housing units. The campus features a collection of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, the 2013 construction being the thirteenth of Wright&#x27;s design, a collection known as Child of the Sun. This additional building includes textile-block construction and colored glass in perforated concrete blocks, and features furniture designed by Wright. It is home to the Sharp Family Tourism and Education Center, a visitor center for guests visiting campus to see the Wright buildings, and includes Wright photographs and a documentary film about the architect&#x27;s work at the school.

==Origin of the word==

The word &quot;Usonian&quot; appears to have been coined by James Duff Law, a Scottish writer born in 1865. In a miscellaneous collection, &quot;Here and There in Two Hemispheres&quot; (1903), Law quoted a letter of his own (dated June 18, 1903) that begins &quot;We of the United States, in justice to Canadians and Mexicans, have no right to use the title &#x27;Americans&#x27; when referring to matters pertaining exclusively to ourselves.&quot; He went on to acknowledge that some author had proposed &quot;Usona&quot; (United States of North America), but that he preferred the form &quot;Usonia&quot; (United States of North Independent America). Perhaps the earliest published use by Wright was in 1927:
However, this may be a misattribution, as there is as yet no other published evidence that Butler ever used the word.

José F. Buscaglia reclaims the term &quot;Usonian&quot; to refer to the peoples, national ideology and neo-imperial tradition of the United States of America.

Miguel Torres-Castro uses the term &quot;Usonian&quot; to refer to the origin of the Atlantic puffin used in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Jupu the Puffin: A Usonian Story&quot;. The bird is a puffin from Maine, US.

<text>The black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) is a tall long-necked wading bird in the stork family. It is a resident species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and near fields of certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages for a wide range of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and irridescent blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris with females sporting yellow irises and males having dark-coloured irises. In Australia, it is known as a [[jabiru]] although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that are strongly territorial when feeding and breeding.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

First described by John Latham as &quot;Mycteria asiatica&quot;, this species was later placed in the genus &quot;Xenorhynchus&quot; based on morphology. Based on behavioural similarities, Kahl suggested the placement of the species in the genus &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot;, which then included a single species, the saddle-billed stork. This placement of both the black-necked stork and saddle-billed stork in the same genus was later supported by osteological and behavioural data, and DNA-DNA hybridisation and cytochrome–&quot;b&quot; data. The genera &quot;Xenorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot; were both erected at the same time, and as first revisor, Kahl selected the latter as the valid genus for the two species. This and the saddle-billed stork &quot;Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis&quot; are the only stork species that show marked sexual dimorphism in iris colour.

Two subspecies are recognized &quot;E. a. asiaticus&quot; of the Oriental region and &quot;E. a. australis&quot; of south New Guinea and Australia. Charles Lucien Bonaparte erected the genus &quot;Xenorhynchus&quot; in 1855 and placed two species in it, &quot;X. indica&quot; and &quot;X. australis&quot;. This treatment was carried on into later works. James Lee Peters in his 1931 work treated them as subspecies. In 1989, McAllan and Bruce again suggested the elevation of the two subspecies into two species: &quot;E. asiaticus&quot; or the green-necked stork of the Oriental region, and &quot;E. australis&quot; or the black-necked stork of the Australian and New Guinean region. This recommendation was based on the disjunct distributions and differences in the iridescent colouration of the neck which the authors suggested might reflect different behavioural displays. This recommendation has not been followed and a subsequent study did not find consistent differences in the colours. Analysis of the cytochrome b mitochondrial sequences however showed significant genetic divergence. The genetic distance of a stork presumed to be &quot;Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus asiaticus&quot; from a confirmed individual of &quot;E. a. australis&quot; was 2.1%, much greater than the genetic distances between individual storks of the same species. The conservative treatment as two subspecies has been followed in the Australian faunal list by Christidis and Boles.

==Description==

The black-necked stork is a large bird, tall having a wingspan. The only published weight for this species was a single specimen at , but this is nearly 35% less than the mean body mass of the closely related and similar sized saddle-billed stork. Therefore, this specimen of black-necked stork could have been at the low end of sizes attainable or perhaps somewhat malnourished. The plumage patterns are conspicuous with younger birds differing from adults. Adults have a glossy bluish-black iridescent head, neck, secondary flight feathers and tail; a coppery-brown crown; a bright white back and belly; bill black with a slightly concave upper edge; and bright red legs. The sexes are identical but the adult female has a yellow iris while the adult male has it brown. Juveniles younger than six months have a brownish iris; a distinctly smaller and straighter beak; a fluffy appearance; brown head, neck, upper back, wings and tail; a white belly; and dark legs. Juveniles older than six months have a mottled appearance especially on the head and neck where the iridescence is partly developed; dark-brown outer primaries; white inner primaries that forms a shoulder patch when the wings are closed; a heavy beak identical in size to adults but still straighter; and dark to pale-pink legs. Like most storks, the black-necked stork flies with the neck outstretched, not retracted like a heron. In flight it appears spindly and a black bar running through the white wings (the somewhat similar looking migratory black stork has an all black wing) with black neck and tail make it distinctive.
==Distribution and habitat==

In India, the species is widespread in the west, central highlands, and northern Gangetic plains extending east into the Assam valley, but rare in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. This distinctive stork is an occasional straggler in southern and eastern Pakistan, and is a confirmed breeding species in central lowland Nepal. It extends into Southeast Asia, through New Guinea and into the northern half of Australia. Compared to other large waterbirds like cranes, spoonbills and other species of storks, black-necked storks are least abundant in locations that have a high diversity of large waterbird species.

The largest population of this species occurs in Australia, where it is found from the Ashburton River, near Onslow, Western Australia, across northern Australia to north-east New South Wales. It extends inland in the Kimberley area to south of Halls Creek; in the Northern Territory to Hooker Creek and Daly Waters; and in Queensland inland to the Boulia area and the New South Wales border, with some records as far south as the north-west plains of New South Wales, along the coast of Sydney and formerly bred near the Shoalhaven River. It is rare along the south-east extremity of its range, but common throughout the north. An estimated 1800 occur in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, with overall numbers during surveys being low in all seasons. A combination of aerial surveys and ground counts in the middle Fly River floodplain, Papua New Guinea estimated 317 (December 1994) and 249 (April 1995) storks.

The largest known breeding population occurs in the largely agricultural landscape of south-western Uttar Pradesh in India. Densities of about 0.099 birds per square kilometre have been estimated in this region made up of a mosaic of cultivated fields and wetlands. About six pairs were found to use the 29 square kilometres of the Keoladeo National Park. One breeding pair has been observed in Bhagalpur district, western Bihar.

In Sri Lanka, the species is a rare breeding resident, with 4–8 breeding pairs in Ruhuna National Park. It is exceedingly rare, and possibly no longer breeding in Bangladesh and Thailand.

Black-necked storks forage in a variety of natural and artificial wetland habitats. They frequently use freshwater, natural wetland habitats such as lakes, ponds, marshes, flooded grasslands, oxbow lakes, swamps, rivers and water meadows. Freshwater, artificial wetland habitats used by these storks include flooded fallow and paddy fields, wet wheat fields, irrigation storage ponds and canals, sewage ponds, and dry floodplains. Small numbers are also seen in Indian coastal wetland habitats, including in mangrove creeks and marshes. In cultivated areas, they prefer natural wetlands to forage in, though flooded rice paddies are preferentially used during the monsoon, likely due to excessive flooding of lakes and ponds. Nests are usually on trees located in secluded parts of large marshes or in cultivated fields as in India and lowland Nepal.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This large stork has a dance-like display. A pair stalk up to each other face to face, extending their wings and fluttering the wing tips rapidly and advancing their heads until they meet. They then clatter their bills and walk away. The display lasts for a minute and may be repeated several times.

Nest building in India commences during the peak of the monsoon with most of the nests initiated during September – November, with few new nests built afterwards until January. They nest on large trees, sometimes isolated in large marshes, or in agricultural landscapes, on which they build a platform. On agricultural landscapes, human disturbance can cause nesting adults to abandon nests in some locations, but storks in other locations nest successfully. The nest is large, as much as 3 to 6 feet across and made up of sticks, branches and lined with rushes, water-plants and sometimes with a mud plaster on the edges. Nests may be reused year after year. The usual clutch is four eggs which are dull white in colour and broad oval in shape, but varies from one to five eggs. The exact incubation period is not known but is suspected to be about 30 days. The chicks hatch with white down which is replaced by a darker grey down on the neck within a week. The scapular feathers emerge first followed by the primaries. 

Fledged young birds make a &quot;chack&quot; sound followed by a repeated &quot;wee-wee-wee&quot; call. Another call is a low high-pitched &quot;peeeeeu-peeeeu-peeeeu-peeu&quot; whistle of 10-12 notes with a ventriloquistic quality. Juveniles at nest also peep continuously to solicit food. 

Adult birds take turns at the nest and when one returns to relieve the other, they perform a greeting display with open wings and an up and down movement of the head. Food is brought for the young chicks by the adults and regurgitated onto the nest platform. Adults stop feeding the young at the nest and begin to show aggression towards the chicks after they are about 3 or 4 months old. The young birds may stay on nearby for about a year but disperse soon. Typically one to three chicks fledge from successful nests, but up to five chicks fledge in years with high rainfall. The number of stork pairs that succeed in raising chicks, and the average size of fledged broods, are strongly related to monsoonal and post-monsoon rainfall, improving in years with more rainfall. 

At the nest trees, which are typically tall with large boles and a wide-canopy, the birds in Bharatpur competed with Indian white-backed vultures sometimes failing to nest due to the vultures. While many wetland birds are flushed by birds of prey, these storks are not usually intimidated and can be quite aggressive to other large water-birds such as herons and cranes. Adults aggressively defend small depressions of deep water against egrets and herons (at Malabanjbanjdju in Kakadu National Park, Australia), and drying wetland patches against waterbirds such as spoonbills and woolly-necked storks (at Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh, India).

The black-necked stork is a carnivore and its diet includes water-birds such as coots, darters, little grebes, northern shoveller, pheasant-tailed jacana, and a range of aquatic vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates such as crabs and molluscs. They also prey on the eggs and hatchlings of turtles. In the Chambal River valley they were observed to locate nests of &quot;Kachuga dhongoka&quot; buried under sand (presumably by moistness of the freshly covered nest) and prey on the eggs of the turtle. In Australia, they sometimes forage at night feeding on emerging nestlings of marine turtles. Stomach content analyses of nine storks in Australia showed their diet to contain crabs, molluscs, insects (grasshoppers and beetles), amphibians, reptiles and birds. The storks had also consumed a small piece of plastic, pebbles, cattle dung, and plant material. In well-protected wetlands, both in Australia and India, black-necked storks feed almost exclusively on fish but in the agriculture-dominated landscape of Uttar Pradesh in India they feed on a wider range of prey including fish, frogs and molluscs; storks obtained fish in wetlands, frogs from roadside ditches, and molluscs from irrigation canals. Although predominantly diurnal, they may forage at night, and have been known to forage on moonlit nights on sea turtle hatchlings on Australian beaches.

They sometimes soar in the heat of the day or rest on their hocks. When disturbed, they may stretch out their necks. Their drinking behaviour involves bending down with open bill and scooping up water with a forward motion followed by raising the bill to swallow water. They sometimes carry water in their bill to chicks at the nest or even during nest building or egg stages.

Like other storks, they are quite mute except at nest where they make bill-clattering sounds. The sounds produced are of a low-pitch and resonant and ends with a short sigh. Juveniles fledged from the nests can occasionally call using a mildly-warbling, high-pitched series of whistles, accompanied with open, quivering wings. These calls and behaviour are directed at adult birds and are a display to solicit food, particularly in drought years when younger birds are apparently unable to find food on their own easily.

Black-necked storks are largely non-social and are usually seen as single birds, pairs and family groups. Flocks of up to 15 storks have been observed in Australia and India, and these possibly form due to local habitat conditions such as drying out of wetlands.

The black-necked stork is the type-host for a species of ectoparasitic Ischnoceran bird louse, &quot;Ardeicola asiaticus&quot; and a species of endoparasitic trematode &quot;Dissurus xenorhynchi&quot;.

==Status and conservation==
The black-necked stork is widely scattered and nowhere found in high densities, making it difficult for populations to be reliably estimated. The Sri Lankan population has been estimated to be about 50 birds while the species has become very rare in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. They may be extinct in the Sundaic region. The combined South and South-east Asian population is placed at less than 1000 birds. A 2011 study found the population in south-western Uttar Pradesh to be stable, although population growth rates may decline with an increase in the number of dry years or land use changes that permanently remove the number of breeding pairs. The Australian population has been suggested to have about 20,000 birds, but the lack of systematic estimates has meant a wide variation in the guesses ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 birds. They are threatened by habitat destruction, the draining of shallow wetlands, disturbance at nests, overfishing, pollution, collision with electricity wires and hunting. However, healthy breeding populations are found in unprotected and intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes (especially in south Asia) and cattle raising areas (as in north-east Australia). Suggestions abound in literature regarding Black-necked Storks requiring undisturbed wetlands, but these appear valid only in areas where hunting of wildlife is common (like in some countries in south-east Asia). Few breeding populations with high breeding success are known primarily due to lack of field work. It is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.

==In culture==

The Mir Shikars, traditional bird hunters of Bihar, India had a ritual practice that required a young man to capture a black-necked stork &quot;Loha Sarang&quot; alive before he could marry. A procession would locate a bird and the bridegroom-to-be would try to catch the bird with a limed stick. The cornered bird was a ferocious adversary. The ritual was stopped in the 1920s after a young man was killed in the process. Young birds have been known to be taken from the nest for meat in Assam.

In Australia, an aboriginal creation myth describes the origin of the bill of the &quot;jabiru&quot; from a spear that went through the head of a bird. The Binbinga people often consider the meat of the bird as taboo and eating its meat would cause an unborn child to cause the death of its mother. The jabiru is known as &quot;karinji&quot; and is the totem of a group known as the Karinji people.

The difference in iris colour among the sexes was noted in 1865 by A D Bartlett, the superintendent in charge of the collection at the Zoological Society of London. The similarity in this aspect with the African saddle-billed stork was noted by Bartlett and commented on by J. H. Gurney. Charles Darwin who corresponded with Bartlett was well aware of this and used it as one of the examples of sexual dimorphism among birds. John Gould in his handbook to the birds of Australia noted that the meat of the bird &quot;... has a fishy flavour, too over-powerful to admit of its being eaten by any one but a hungry explorer.&quot;

<text>The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), also known as the common peafowl, or blue peafowl, is a peafowl species native to the Indian subcontinent. While it originated in the Indian subcontinent, it has since been introduced to many other parts of the world. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although both sexes are often referred to colloquially as a &quot;peacock&quot;.

The Indian peafowl displays a marked form of sexual dimorphism. The brightly coloured male has a blue coloured head with a fan-shaped crest and is best known for their long train. The train is made up of elongated upper-tail covert feathers with colourful eyespots. These stiff feathers are raised into a fan and quivered in a display during courtship. The peahen is predominantly brown in colour, with a white face and iridescent green lower neck, and lack the elaborate train. There are several colour mutations of the Indian peafowl including the leucistic white peafowl.

Despite the length and size of the covert feathers, the peacock is still capable of flight. The peafowl lives mainly on the ground in open forests or on cultivable lands where it forages for berries and grains, and also preys on snakes, lizards and small rodents. It makes loud calls, which makes it easier to detect, and are often used to indicate the presence of a predator in the forest areas. It forages on the ground in small groups and usually escapes on foot through undergrowth and avoids flying, though it flies into tall trees to roost.

The function of the Indian peacock&#x27;s elaborate train has been debated for more than a century. In the 19th century, Charles Darwin found it a puzzle, hard to explain through ordinary natural selection. His later explanation, sexual selection, is widely but not universally accepted. In the 20th century, Amotz Zahavi argued that the train was a handicap, and that males were honestly signalling their fitness in proportion to the splendour of their trains. Despite extensive study, opinions remain divided on the mechanisms involved.

The Indian peafowl is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is the national bird of India and venerated in Hindu and Greek mythology.

== Taxonomy==
The Indian peafowl was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Pavo&quot; is Latin for &quot;peacock&quot;, which came from the Greek word &quot;taos&quot; derived from Persian &quot;tavus&quot;, which came from the Tamil word &quot;tokei&quot;. The specific epitet &quot;cristatus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;crested&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The earliest usage of the word peacock in written English was from the 14th century where Geoffrey Chaucer (1343–1400) used the word in a simile &quot;proud a pekok&quot; in his epic poem &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. Various spelling variants included peacock, pacok, pecok, pekok, pokok, and pocok among others.

== Description ==
The Indian peafowl&#x27;s size, color and shape of the crest make them easily identifiable within their native distribution range. It displays a marked form of sexual dimorphism. A male peafowl or peacock is a larger sized bird with an average bill to tail length of and as much as to the end of a fully grown train. It weighs and is amongst the heaviest birds in Phasianidae. The male has a metallic blue crown with short and curled, blue-greenish head feathers. It has a fan-shaped crest with bare black shafts and tipped with bluish-green webbing. A white stripe above the eye and a crescent shaped white patch below the eye are formed by bare white skin. The lore, chin and throat are covered with greenish feathers. It has a long blue neck with scaly bronze-green feathers with black and copper markings in the back. The scapular region and wings are made of chestnut colored primary feathers with black secondaries. The tail is dark brown with glossy green chest, buff thighs, and blackish-brown abdomen and tail coverts.

The male is best known for its elongated train, which extend from the rump. The train is made up of elongated upper tail coverts, which are bronze-green train with the outermost and longer feathers ending up with an elaborate eye-spot. The eye-spots consist of a purplish-black, heart-shaped nucleus, enclosed by blue and an outer copper rim, which is surrounded by alternating green and bronze. A few of the outer feathers lack the spot and end in a crescent shaped black tip. The feathers of the train does not have colored pigments and the colorization is a result of the micro-structure of the feathers and the optical phenomena involved. The male has a spur on the leg above the hind toe. The train feathers and the tarsal spur of the male starts developing only in the second year of its life. The trains are not fully developed until the age of four. The train feathers of the male Indian peafowl are also moulted every year, usually starting at the end of the monsoon in August or September and are fully developed by February to March. The moult of the flight feathers may be spread out across the year.

The females or peahens, are smaller at around in length and weigh . The peahen has a rufous-brown head with a crest, whose tips are chestnut colored and edged with green. The upper body is brownish with pale mottling and the primaries, secondaries and tail are dark brown. The lower neck is metallic green with dark brown breast feathers glossed with green and whitish underparts. Both the sexes have dark brown eyes, brown colored beak and legs. Young males also resemble the females with chestnut colored primaries.

=== Mutations and hybrids ===
There are several colour mutations of Indian peafowl. These very rarely occur in the wild, but selective breeding has made them common in captivity. The black-shouldered mutation was initially considered as a subspecies or even a separate species of the Indian peafowl (&quot;P. nigripennis&quot;). English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) presented firm evidence for it being a variety under domestication, which is now well established and accepted. It was important for Darwin to prove that it was a colour variation rather than a wild species as it was contrary to his theory of slow modification by natural selection in the wild. In this genetic variation, the adult male is melanistic with black wings. The young birds are creamy white with fulvous-tipped wings. The gene which produces melanism in the male, causes s a dilution of colour in females, which have creamy white and brown markings. Other forms of mutations include the pied and white mutations, which are the result of allelic variation at specific loci.

Crosses between a male green peafowl (&quot;Pavo muticus&quot;) and a female Indian peafowl (&quot;P. cristatus&quot;) produce a stable hybrid called a &quot;Spalding&quot;, named after Keith Spalding, a bird fancier from California. There can be problems if birds of unknown pedigree are released into the wild, as the viability of such hybrids and their offspring is often reduced as per Haldane&#x27;s rule.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Indian peafowl is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent and is found across most of India and Sri Lanka. In India, it is found across the country from the Indus valley in the north-west to Assam in the north-east, and from Himalayas in the north to the southern tip, except for the marshlands of Sunderbans in East India. In India, it is found up to elevations of in the north and upto in the mountains of the south. In Sri Lanka, it largely inhabits the drier lowland areas. It is generally found in forests, small hills, and bushy areas near water sources. It also occupies cultivable lands and live in a semi-domesticated state in human habitations. The peafowl has since been introduced in many other parts of the world and has become feral in some areas. It was supposedly introduced into Europe by Alexander the Great, while the bird might have been introduced earlier and had reached Athens by 450 BCE.

The first whole-genome sequencing of the Indian peafowl identified 15,970 protein-coding sequences and was found to have less repetitive DNA (8.62%) than that of the chicken genome (9.45%). Studies have suggested that the population suffered at least two bottlenecks (four mya and 450,000 years ago), which resulted in a severe reduction in its effective population size.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The Indian peafowl forages on the ground in small groups, known as musters, that usually have a single peacock and three to five peahens. After the breeding season, the flocks tend to be made up only of females and young. It is found in the open early in the mornings and tends to rest under cover during the heat of the day. It is often sighted dust-bathing at dusk. It roosts on tall trees at night, but may sometimes make use of rocks or buildings. Birds usually arrive at their roosting sites during the dusk and call frequently before taking their positions. Despite its size, the Indian peafowl is capable of flight. However, it rarely flies and often escapes by running on foot through the undergrowth when perturbed or disturbed. When it takes off, it uses regular, slower flaps to maintain flight rather than gliding.

=== Feeding ===
The Indian peafowl is found lazily feeding in the open early in the mornings, and might move to cultivated lands to feed during the mornings and the evenings. The groups often walk in single file to the nearby waterholes for a drink. The birds often congregate near human habitats and might be fed by humans. It is omnivorous and feeds on grass, seeds, flowerbuds, fruits, insects, and small reptiles. It feeds on smaller snakes but keeps its distance from larger ones. It also feeds on a wide range of crops such as groundnut, tomato, paddy, chili and bananas in 
cultivated areas. In Western India, a large percentage of its food is made up of the fallen berries of &quot;Zizyphus&quot;. Around human habitations, it feeds on food scraps and even human excreta.

=== Communication ===
The most common calls are a loud &quot;pia-ow&quot; or &quot;may-awe&quot; with the frequency of calling increasing before the monsoon season. It raises loud sounds when alarmed or disturbed and are often used to indicate the presence of a predators such as the tiger in the forests. It also makes other calls such as a rapid series of &quot;ka-aan..ka-aan&quot; or a rapid &quot;kok-kok&quot;. It often emits an explosive low-pitched &quot;honk!&quot; when agitated. It might even call at night when alarmed and neighboring birds may call in a relay like series. Nearly seven different call variants have been identified apart from six variants of alarm calls that are commonly produced by both the sexes.

=== Breeding ===
Indian peacocks are polygamous . The peafowl usually reaches sexual maturity at the age of two to three years old. The breeding season may be spread out over the entire year and is more common during the monsoon months of June to August. Several males may congregate at a lek site and these males are often closely related. Males at leks maintain small territories next to each other and allow females to visit them. Males make no attempt to guard harems and females do not favour specific males.

A peacock use its ornate train in a courtship display, wherein it raises the tail feathers into an arched fan and quivers them. The wings are held half open and drooped and it periodically vibrates the long feathers, producing a ruffling sound. It faces the peahen initially and might turn around to display the tail. The peacock may also freeze over food to invite a peahen in a form of courtship feeding. While peacocks may also display even in the absence of peahens, it is usually done close to the females. When a peacock is displaying, peahens appear not to show any interest and usually continue their foraging.

The nests are usually shallow hollow scrapes on the ground lined with leaves, sticks and other debris. The peafowl might also nest on crevices in the buildings, and disused nests of vultures. The female lays a clutch of three to eight oval shaped eggs. The eggs measure about in length and in width. They appear polished and have thick shells with pits and pores. The color varies from pale white to buff or reddish-brown. The males take no part in hatching or rearing the young. However, isolated unusual instance of a male incubating a clutch of eggs has been reported. The eggs are incubated by the females for about 28 days. The chicks are nidifugous and follow the mother around after hatching. Downy young may sometimes climb on their mothers&#x27; back and the female may carry them in flight to a safe tree branch. 

=== Sexual selection ===
The Indian peacock is known for its brighter and elaborate colours, compared to the much duller peahen, which has been a puzzle to scientists. Charles Darwin failed to see an adaptive advantage for the extravagant tail which seemed only to be an encumbrance. He wrote to botanist Asa Gray, &quot;the sight of a feather in a peacock&#x27;s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!&quot;. He developed the principle of sexual selection to explain the problem, however, though not everyone accepted the theory. In 1907, American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer showed in his painting that the eyespots helped form a disruptive camouflage. In his 1909 book &quot;Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom&quot;, he denied the possibility of sexual selection and argued that essentially all forms of animal coloration had evolved as camouflage. The theory was criticized by former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. 

In the 1970s, Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi proposed a possible resolution to the apparent contradiction between natural selection and sexual selection. He argued that the peacock honestly signalled the handicap of having a large and costly train. However, the mechanism may be less straightforward than it seems and the cost could be that the hormones that enhance feather development also results in the depression of the immune system. Ronald Fisher&#x27;s runaway model proposed a positive feedback between female preference for elaborate trains and development of the elaborate train itself. However, this model assumes that the male train is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation and a molecular phylogeny study shows the opposite that the most recently evolved species is actually the least ornamented one. This finding suggests a chase-away sexual selection in which females evolved resistance to the male ploy of elaborate trains&quot;.

A study on the feral population of Indian peafowl at Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England, showed that the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male&#x27;s mating success, and this success could be manipulated by cutting the eyespots off some of the male&#x27;s ornate feathers. Furthermore, the study also found that the chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, which indicated an increased survival ability. However, recent studies have failed to find a relation between the number of displayed eyespots and mating success.

A seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl came to the conclusion that female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains and it is an obsolete signal for which female preference has already been &quot;lost or weakened&quot;. It found no evidence that peahens expressed any preference for peacocks with more elaborate trains, trains having more ocelli, a more symmetrical arrangement, or greater length. It determined that the peacock&#x27;s train was not the universal target of female mate choice, and do not correlate to male physical conditions. It argued that the removal of eyespots substantially changed the appearance of male peafowls, and it was likely that the females mistook these males for sub-adults, or perceived that the males were physically damaged. Moreover, in a feral peafowl population, there is little variation in the number of eyespots in adult males as it is rare for adult males to lose a significant number of eyespots and hence, it might not form the basis for sexual selection. The British research team argued that alternative explanations for these results had been overlooked, and concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions.

A 2010 study on a natural population of Indian peafowls in Northern India proposed a &quot;high maintenance handicap&quot; theory. It stated that only the fittest males can afford the time and energy to maintain a long tail and the long train is an indicator of good body condition, which results in greater mating success. While train length seems to correlate positively with major histocompatibility complex diversity in males, females do not appear to use train length to choose males. Another study in France brought up two possible explanations with the first explanation stating that there might be a genetic variation of the trait of interest under different geographical areas due to a founder effect and/or a genetic drift. The second explanation suggested that &quot;the cost of trait expression may vary with environmental conditions,&quot; so that a trait that is indicative of a particular quality may not work in another environment. A 2013 study that tracked the eye movements of peahens responding to male displays found that the peahens looked in the direction of the upper train of feathers only when at long distances and that they looked only at the lower feathers when males displayed close to them. The rattling of the tail and the shaking of the wings helped in keeping the attention of females.
=== Lifespan and mortality ===
The Indian peafowl is known to live for up to 23 years in captivity. However, it is estimated to live for only about 15 years in the wild. Large predators such as tiger, leopard, hyena, dhole, and golden jackal, can ambush an adult Indian peafowl. An adult peafowl is difficult to capture since it can usually escape these ground predators by flying into trees. Smaller birds can be sometimes hunted by large birds of prey such as changeable hawk-eagle and rock eagle-owl. Chicks are more prone to predation than adult birds. Adults living near human habitations might sometimes hunted by domestic dogs or by humans in some areas. The peafowls often forage in groups as it provides some safety as there are more eyes to look out for predators.

== Threats and conservation ==
The Indian peafowl is widely distributed across India and Sri lanka, with introduced feral colonies in many parts of the world. Conservative estimates of the population in 2002 put them at more than 100,000. While the exact population size is unknown, it is not believed to be under decline. Hence, it is classified as least concern by the IUCN. Poaching of peacocks for their meat and feathers and accidental poisoning by feeding on pesticide treated seeds are known threats to wild birds. It is also hunted in some areas for usage in folk remedies. The birds have been part of the agricultural ecosystem for centuries, where they aid in seed dispersal and feed on pests such as insects and small rodents. However, the birds can be a nuisance to agriculture as they trample crops and overeat the grains. A 2018 study found that there can be a 40% decrease in yield in paddy fields due to the damage caused by the birds. In urban areas, they can damage plants in gardens, attack their reflections (thereby breaking glass and mirrors), perch and scratch cars or leave their droppings.

The Indian peafowl is protected both culturally and by law in India and Sri lanka. Methods to identify if feathers have been plucked or have been shed naturally have been developed, as Indian law allows only the collection of feathers that have been shed. Various methods have been employed to restrict access to the farmlands such as usage of jute fencing and application of non-poisonous pesticides to reduce fatality of the birds. Cities have been introduced peafowl management programmes, which include education on how to prevent the birds from causing damage while treating the birds humanely. Various wildlife sanctuaries have been established in India such as Adichunchanagiri, Choolannur, and Viralimalai for the protection of the species. The Indian peafowl also breed readily in captivity and various zoos, parks, and bird-fanciers maintain breeding populations across the world.

==In culture==
The Indian peafowl has been used in numerous mythological and contemporary representations. It is designated as the national bird of India. In the Indian subcontinent, many Hindu deities are associated with the bird, and it is frequently depicted in various temple art, mythology, poetry, folk music and traditions. The Hindu war god Kartikeya is depicted as using an Indian peacock named Parvani as his vahana. Hindu god Krishna is often depicted with an Indian peacock feather on his crown. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; describes that the head of the devas, Indra, who unable to defeat the asura king Ravana, sheltered under the wing of a peacock and later blessed it with a &quot;thousand eyes&quot; and fearlessness from serpents. Another mythological story narrates that Indra was cursed with a thousand ulcers and was transformed into a peacock with a thousand eyes before his curse was removed by Vishnu. In Buddhist philosophy, the Indian peacock represents wisdom. 

Numerous uses of the bird&#x27;s parts as an antidote to snake venom in Ayurveda and other folk remedies have been documented. It is part of folklore with beliefs such as the impregnation of peahens orally by means of the tears of the peacocks. In Greek mythology, the origin of the Indian peacock&#x27;s plumage is explained in the tale of Hera and Argus. The main figure of Yezidis, Melek Taus, is commonly depicted as a peacock. 
A golden peacock is considered as a symbol of Ashkenazi Jewish culture, and is the subject of several folktales and songs in Yiddish. 
In the Middle Ages, knights in Europe took a &quot;vow of the peacock&quot; and decorated their helmets with its plumes. In Robin Hood stories, the titular archer uses arrows fletched with peacock feathers. Peacock feathers were buried with Viking warriors.

The birds were often kept in menageries and as ornaments in large gardens and estates in the middle ages. In 1526, the legal issue as to whether peacocks were wild or domestic fowl was thought sufficiently important for Cardinal Wolsey to summon all the English judges to give their opinion, which was that they are domestic fowl. Indian peacocks were frequently used in European heraldry with the peacocks most often depicted as facing the viewer and with the tails displayed. In this pose, the peacock is referred to as being &quot;in his pride&quot;. Peacock tails, in isolation from the rest of the bird, are rare in British heraldry, but are used frequently in German systems. The Indian peacock feathers are used in many rituals and ornamentation and its motifs are widespread in architecture, coinage, textiles and modern items of art and utility. Indian peacock motifs are widely used even today such as in the logos of the NBC television network and the Sri Lankan Airlines.

The term &quot;peacocking&quot; is often used as a means of depicting pride in English language and is used to describe someone who is very proud or gives a lot of attention to his/her clothing. In Australia, it referred to the practice of buying up the best pieces of land so as to render the surrounding lands valueless.

<doc id="548258" wikidata="Q1701704" url="?curid=548258" title="USS Helena (CL-50)">
<text>USS &quot;Helena&quot; was a light cruiser built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s, the ninth and final member of the class. The &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s were the first modern light cruisers built by the US Navy under the limitations of the London Naval Treaty, and they were intended to counter the Japanese ; as such, they carried a battery of fifteen guns, the same gun armament carried by the &quot;Mogami&quot;s. &quot;Helena&quot; and her sister were built to a slightly modified design with a unit system of machinery and an improved anti-aircraft battery. Completed in 1939, &quot;Helena&quot; spent the first two years of her career in peacetime training that accelerated as tensions between the United States and Japan increased through 1941. She was torpedoed at the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and was repaired and modernized in early 1942.

After returning to service, &quot;Helena&quot; was assigned to the forces participating in the Guadalcanal campaign in the south Pacific. There, she took part in two major night battles with Japanese vessels in October and November 1942. The first, the Battle of Cape Esperance on the night of 11–12 October, resulted in a Japanese defeat, with &quot;Helena&quot;″s rapid-fire 6-inch battery helping to sink a heavy cruiser and a destroyer. The second, the first night of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in the early hours of 13 November, saw a similar defeat imposed on the Japanese; again, &quot;Helena&quot;″s fast shooting helped to overwhelm a Japanese task force that included two fast battleships, one of which was disabled by heavy American fire and sank the next day. &quot;Helena&quot; sank a destroyer and damaged several others in the action while emerging relatively unscathed. During her tour in the south Pacific, she also escorted convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the Marines fighting on Guadalcanal and bombarded Japanese positions on the island and elsewhere in the Solomons.

Following the American victory on Guadalcanal in early 1943, Allied forces began preparations to advance along the Solomon chain, first targeting New Georgia. &quot;Helena&quot; took part in a series of preparatory attacks on the island through mid-1943, culminating in an amphibious assault in the Kula Gulf on 5 July. The next night, while attempting to intercept a Japanese reinforcement squadron, &quot;Helena&quot; was torpedoed and sunk in the Battle of Kula Gulf. Most of her crew were picked up by a pair of destroyers and one group landed on New Georgia where they were evacuated the next day, but more than a hundred remained at sea for two days, ultimately making land on Japanese-occupied Vella Lavella. There, they were hidden from Japanese patrols by Solomon Islanders and a coastwatcher detachment before being evacuated on the night of 15–16 July. &quot;Helena&quot;″s wreck was located in 2018 by Paul Allen.

==Design==

As the major naval powers negotiated the London Naval Treaty in 1930, which contained a provision limiting the construction of heavy cruisers armed with guns, United States naval designers came to the conclusion that with a displacement limited to , a better protected vessel could be built with an armament of guns. The designers also theorized that the much higher rate of fire of the smaller guns would allow a ship armed with twelve of the guns to overpower one armed with eight 8-inch guns. During the design process of the , which began immediately after the treaty was signed, the US Navy became aware that the next class of Japanese cruisers, the , would be armed with a main battery of fifteen 6-inch guns, prompting them to adopt the same number of guns for the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s. After building seven ships to the original design, additional changes were incorporated, particularly to the propulsion machinery and the secondary battery, resulting in the &quot;St. Louis&quot; sub-class, of which &quot;Helena&quot; was the second member.

&quot;Helena&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Unlike the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s, the two &quot;St. Louis&quot;-class cruisers arranged their machinery in the unit system, alternating boiler and engine rooms. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried four Curtiss SOC Seagull floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her crew numbered 52 officers and 836 enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of fifteen 6 in /47 caliber Mark 16 guns in five 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Three were placed forward, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair facing forward, with the third being directly pointed aft; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of eight /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets, with one turret on either side of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft (AA) battery of eight guns, but her anti-aircraft battery was revised during her career. The ship&#x27;s belt armor consisted of 5 inches on a layer of of special treatment steel and her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Helena&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

===Modifications===
The main prewar alterations to the ship revolved around her anti-aircraft battery: in 1941, the Navy decided that each member of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; class was to be equipped with four quadruple anti-aircraft guns, but the guns were in short supply, and &quot;Helena&quot; was the only member of the class to have received any of her 1.1 in guns by November 1941. The guns &quot;Helena&quot; received were placed in the mounts for the .50-cal guns, which were transferred to wheeled carts that could be moved to different firing positions.

The ship was reconstructed in 1942 during repairs as a result of damage sustained in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. SG surface search radar, SC air search radar, and FC and FD fire-control radar sets for her main and secondary batteries were installed, along with a new anti-aircraft battery of eight Oerlikon cannon and sixteen Bofors guns in quadruple mounts, along with a director for each Bofors mount. Her 1.1 in guns were removed to arm her sister ships and . The ship&#x27;s armored conning tower had proved to inhibit good all-around visibility, so it was removed and an open bridge was erected in its place. In addition, the weight savings achieved by removing the tower helped to offset the increased weight from the larger anti-aircraft battery. The conning tower, along with those of several of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class cruisers that were also rebuilt in 1942, were later installed on the reconstructed battleships that had been sunk at Pearl Harbor.

==Service history==
===Construction and early career===

The US Navy awarded the contract for &quot;Helena&quot; to the New York Navy Yard on 9 September 1935, and the keel for the new ship was laid down on 9 December 1936. Her completed hull was launched on 28 August 1938 and she was commissioned on 18 September 1939 with the hull number CL-50. World War II had broken out in Europe in September that year, but for the time being, the United States remained neutral. After entering service, the ship was occupied with sea trials and initial training, and she embarked on a major shakedown cruise abroad on 27 December, bound for South American waters. She stopped in Guantanamo Bay, an American-leased naval base in Cuba, on the way before arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 22 January 1940; from there, she continued on to Montevideo, Uruguay, on 29 January. While in the latter port, the crew inspected the wreck of the German heavy cruiser that had recently been scuttled after the Battle of the River Plate the previous month. &quot;Helena&quot; got underway again in mid-February to return to the United States, again passing through Guantanamo Bay on the way. After returning, she was dry-docked for repairs from 2 March to 14 July.

She took part in training exercises and sea trials over the next several months until September, when she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet. She passed through the Panama Canal toward the end of the month and arrived in San Pedro, California, on 3 October. From there, she continued on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to join the rest of the fleet, arriving there on 21 October. Over the course of the next year, the fleet spent its time conducting training exercises and shooting practice as tensions with Japan rose over the latter&#x27;s war against China. During this period, from 14 July 1941 to 16 September, the ship was dry-docked for maintenance at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California; it was during this period that the ship received her 1.1-inch guns. &quot;Helena&quot; was slated to be dry-docked for another periodic maintenance in December 1941, and was moored in port with the minelayer tied alongside on 6 December, awaiting her turn in the shipyard. The ships happened to be moored in the berth normally reserved for the battleship , which was currently in the dry-dock. The ship&#x27;s commander was at that time Captain Robert Henry English.

===World War II===
====Attack on Pearl Harbor====


On the morning of 7 December, the Japanese launched their surprise attack on the American fleet with a first wave of forty Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers, fifty-one Aichi D3A dive bombers, and fifty B5N high-level bombers, escorted by forty-three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. The Japanese expected &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; to be in her normal berth. Three minutes into the attack, which had begun at 07:55, a B5N torpedo bomber dropped its torpedo at what its pilot expected to be the battleship. The torpedo passed underneath &quot;Oglala&quot; and exploded against &quot;Helena&quot;″s hull on the starboard side, nearly amidships. The blast tore a hole in the hull that flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms and severed wiring for the main and secondary guns. The ship&#x27;s crew raced to their battle stations and two minutes after the torpedo hit, the backup forward diesel generator had been turned on, restoring power to the guns. &quot;Oglala&quot; was less fortunate than &quot;Helena&quot;, as the blast effect loosened hull plates on the minelayer and caused her to capsize.

The first pilot had mistaken the superimposed silhouettes of the two ships, backlit by the sun, to be &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. The second torpedo bomber in the wave closed to within of &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Oglala&quot; when the pilot realized the first pilot&#x27;s mistake, breaking off his attack run and causing two more pilots to do the same. Four other pilots pressed their attacks, but all of their torpedoes missed; by this time, the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns were beginning to engage the Japanese attackers, forcing one of the bombers to drop their torpedo before they reached an ideal launch position. One of the torpedoes went wide and hit a transformer station, while the other three ran deep and embedded themselves in the harbor floor. During these attacks, one of the fighters strafed the ship, causing little damage.

At the same time that the first wave had begun their attacks, the Japanese aircraft carriers launched a second wave consisting of eighty-one dive bombers, fifty-four high-level bombers, and thirty-six fighters. As &quot;Helena&quot;″s anti-aircraft guns got into action, they helped to fend off further attacks from the second strike wave while other men worked to control flooding by closing the many watertight hatches in the ship. The heavy anti-aircraft fire was credited with disrupting the aim of several Japanese bombers, which failed to hit the vessel with an estimated four near misses. Of these, one struck the pier while the other three landed in the water on her starboard side.

&quot;Helena&quot;″s anti-aircraft battery provided a heavy barrage of fire during the attack; she fired approximately 375 shells from her 5-inch guns, around 3,000 rounds from her 1.1-inch guns, and about 5,000 rounds from her .50-cal. guns. She was credited with shooting down six Japanese aircraft, out of a total of twenty-nine aircraft downed in the raid. Twenty-six men were killed in the initial attack and another five later died of their wounds, while another sixty-six were injured but recovered. A significant number of the casualties were the result of the torpedo hit, with many of the remainder from bomb fragments from the near misses.

Two days after the attack, &quot;Helena&quot; was moved into dry dock No. 2 in Pearl Harbor for an inspection and temporary repairs to allow her to return to the west coast of the United States. Steel plates were welded over the torpedo hole and on 31 December, &quot;Helena&quot; was re-floated. She got underway for Mare Island for permanent repairs and modifications on 5 January 1942 in company with a convoy bound for California. The vessel arrived in the shipyard on 13 January and was dry-docked six days later. Repair work was completed by 4 July, with initial sea trials taking place on 3 to 4 July; only the directors for the 40 mm guns, still en route from the manufacturer, were left to be fitted. The directors arrived shortly thereafter and were installed on 10 July. &quot;Helena&quot; then conducted a brief period of training that lasted until 15 July, when she returned to Mare Island to have her SG radar installed. She departed Mare Island later that month, moving to San Francisco where she joined six transports bound for the south Pacific. The transports carried a contingent of Seabees to Espiritu Santo. There, &quot;Helena&quot; joined Task Force (TF) 64, then in the midst of the fighting around Guadalcanal.

====Guadalcanal Campaign====


Over the course of the next two months, &quot;Helena&quot; and the rest of TF 64 were occupied with covering reinforcement convoys to support the Marines fighting on Guadalcanal and escorting carrier battle groups in the area. While &quot;Helena&quot; operated with the carrier on 15 September, a Japanese submarine attacked the fleet and hit &quot;Wasp&quot; with three torpedoes, inflicting fatal damage. &quot;Helena&quot; picked up some four hundred survivors from &quot;Wasp&quot; and carried them back to Espiritu Santo. Shortly thereafter, Captain Gilbert C. Hoover came aboard the ship to replace English. By this time, the task force consisted of &quot;Helena&quot;, her sister ship , the heavy cruisers and , and the destroyers , , , , and .

Following the Actions along the Matanikau in late September and early October, the decision was made to send further reinforcements to the island, and so the 164th Infantry Regiment of the Americal Division embarked on a pair of destroyer transports; TF 64 provided the close escort for the vessels, screening them to the west to prevent Japanese forces from intercepting them. By this time, the unit was commanded by Rear Admiral (RADM) Norman Scott, who conducted one night of battle practice with his ships on 8 October before embarking on the operation. The ships patrolled to the south, just out of range of Japanese aircraft based in Rabaul over the course of 9 and 10 October and each day at 12:00 Scott took his ships north to Rennell Island, where they would be in position to reach Savo Island to block a Japanese squadron if it was detected by air. On 11 October, American aerial reconnaissance detected Japanese vessels moving toward the island carrying their own reinforcements, and Scott decided to try to intercept them.

=====Battle of Cape Esperance=====


Unknown to Scott, the Japanese had sent a group of cruisers and destroyers to bombard the American garrison on Guadalcanal; this unit, commanded by Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō, consisted of the heavy cruisers , , and and the destroyers and . As the two squadrons approached each other in the darkness at the southern end of the Slot shortly before 22:00 on 11 October, three of the four American cruisers launched their floatplanes, but &quot;Helena&quot; did not receive the instruction from Scott aboard his flagship &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and so her crew dumped the aircraft overboard to reduce the risk of fire in the event of a battle. By 22:23, the American ships had arranged themselves into a line in the order &quot;Farenholt&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot;, &quot;Laffey&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Boise&quot;, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Buchanan&quot;, and &quot;McCalla&quot;; this was despite the fact that &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Boise&quot; both carried SG radar, which was significantly more effective than the SC sets carried by the other vessels. The distance between each ship ranged from . Visibility was poor because the moon had already set, leaving no ambient light and no visible sea horizon.

&quot;Helena&quot;″s radar operators picked up the oncoming Japanese squadron at 23:25, fixing their position as being away at 23:32. Shortly after &quot;Helena&quot; initially detected the Japanese, Scott had reversed the course of his ships, steaming to the southwest as Gotō&#x27;s vessels steamed perpendicular to Scott&#x27;s course. This would place the American squadron in position to cross the T of the Japanese formation. Officers aboard &quot;Helena&quot; assumed that Scott was aware of the contacts based on his course reversal. By 23:45, the gunnery radar of the American flagship finally detected the Japanese at a range of only , which was confirmed by lookouts on the American vessels. Hoover requested permission from Scott to open fire, and after receiving what he interpreted as an affirmative answer, he ordered his guns to begin firing at 23:46. The other ships in the squadron quickly followed &quot;Helena&quot;″s example. Gotō was at that time still unaware of the Americans&#x27; presence and his ships were not prepared for action, having assumed that after the Battle of Savo Island, American naval forces would not challenge Japanese warships at night.

The initial salvos struck &quot;Aoba&quot;, inflicting serious damage and mortally wounding Gotō, causing further confusion on the Japanese ships. After only a minute of firing, Scott ordered his ships to cease firing because he was concerned they were accidentally shooting at the leading trio of destroyers, which had fallen out of formation during the course reversal. Fire from the American ships did not actually stop at this point, and after clarifying the position of his ships, he ordered TF 64 to resume firing at 23:51. During this period, the captain of &quot;Furutaka&quot; turned to port to escape the heavy American fire, but reversed course at 23:49 to come to &quot;Aoba&quot;″s aid. This maneuver rewarded &quot;Furutaka&quot; with numerous shell hits from several warships including &quot;Helena&quot;, at least one of which detonated the torpedoes in her deck launchers and caused a major fire. &quot;Kinugasa&quot; also immediately turned to port, but unlike &quot;Furutaka&quot;, her captain continued to withdraw along with &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot;, avoiding any damage to his vessel. &quot;Fubuki&quot; turned to a course parallel with the American squadron; initially targeted by &quot;San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Boise&quot; and set on fire, &quot;Fubuki&quot; then drew heavy fire from most of the other vessels. In the confused, close-range action, either &quot;Helena&quot; or &quot;Boise&quot; (the only ships armed with 6-inch guns) accidentally hit &quot;Farenholt&quot;, causing flooding and a fuel leak that forced her to withdraw from the battle.

At around midnight, Scott sought to reorganize his squadron to more effectively pursue the Japanese vessels; he ordered his ships to flash their fighting lights and come back into formation. At 00:06, lookouts aboard &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Boise&quot; spotted the wakes of torpedoes that had been launched by &quot;Kinugasa&quot; as she withdrew. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Kinugasa&quot; opened fire with her main battery, inflicting serious damage to &quot;Boise&quot;. After a short duel between &quot;Kinugasa&quot; and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, Scott broke off the action as the Japanese continued to flee northeast. Despite having been hit more than forty times, &quot;Aoba&quot; survived the battle, though &quot;Furutaka&quot; eventually succumbed to progressive flooding, as did &quot;Fubuki&quot;; &quot;Helena&quot; contributed to both vessels&#x27; demise. Despite having defeated the Japanese bombardment force, Scott missed a second group of warships carrying reinforcements to Guadalcanal, and they were able to deposit their men and supplies without incident.

Shortly after the battle, the new fast battleship was transferred to TF 64, which now came under the command of RADM Willis Lee. By this time, the unit also included &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, the light cruiser , and six destroyers. On 20 October, &quot;Helena&quot; came under attack from a Japanese submarine while she patrolled between Espiritu Santo and San Cristobal, but the torpedoes missed. Over the course of 21–24 October, Japanese land-based reconnaissance aircraft made repeated contacts with TF 64 as a Japanese fleet approached the area, but in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands that began on the 25th, the Japanese concentrated their air attacks on the American carriers of TF 17 and 61 and Lee&#x27;s ships saw no action. On 4 November, &quot;Helena&quot; was back off Guadalcanal to provide fire support during the Koli Point action. &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and the destroyer shelled Japanese positions as they came under attack from elements of the 164th Infantry Regiment and the 8th Marines, ultimately annihilating the Japanese defenders by 9 November.

===== Naval Battle of Guadalcanal =====


In early November, both sides began preparations to resupply their forces fighting on and around Guadalcanal. An American convoy carrying 5,500 soldiers and supplies was organized, to be covered by TF 16, centered on the carrier ; &quot;Washington&quot; was detached from TF 64 to strengthen the covering force and the cruiser unit was reorganized as TF 67.4 and assigned as the close escort. Commanded by RADM Daniel J. Callaghan, the unit now included, in addition to &quot;Helena&quot;, the heavy cruisers &quot;San Francisco&quot; and , the light cruisers &quot;Atlanta&quot; and , and the destroyers , &quot;Laffey&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot;, , , , , and . Overall command rested with RADM Richmond K. Turner. Meanwhile, the Japanese had assembled a convoy of their own carrying 7,000 men and supplies for the army already on Guadalcanal; it was to be supported by a bombardment force of two fast battleships, a light cruiser, and eleven destroyers. A total of four heavy and one light cruisers and six destroyers would cover the convoy.

On 12 November, Callaghan&#x27;s ships and their transport vessels arrived off Guadalcanal, and while they unloaded, a Japanese artillery battery opened fire on the transports. &quot;Helena&quot; and then some of the destroyers returned fire to suppress the Japanese gunners. A Japanese airstrike interrupted the work; two ships were damaged but &quot;Helena&quot; emerged unscathed. Reconnaissance aircraft detected the approach of the Japanese bombardment force, the convoy, and a detached group of destroyers. Turner believed that the Japanese aimed to either attack TF 67.4 and the transports as they withdrew that night or to bombard the Americans on Guadalcanal; he decided to keep Callaghan&#x27;s unit off Guadalcanal and to send the convoy off with an escort of just three destroyers and two destroyer minesweepers, as TF 16 was too far south to be able to reach the area. Callaghan escorted the convoy through Lengo Channel before turning back west to position his ships between the Japanese squadron and the garrison on Guadalcanal. The approaching Japanese force, commanded by RADM Hiroaki Abe, centered on the battleships and .

Callaghan arranged his ships in a single column, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, and he similarly failed to realize the advantage that the SG-radar-equipped ships provided, eschewing those vessels so-equipped for &quot;San Francisco&quot;. Scott had transferred to &quot;Atlanta&quot;, which did not mount an SG, but it was placed as the frontmost cruiser. Abe&#x27;s ships reached the area off Cape Esperance at around 01:25 on 13 November, by which time his vessels had fallen into disarray due to bad weather that greatly hampered visibility. The destroyers he believed were screening his advance were in fact out of position. Abe was aware of Callaghan&#x27;s presence off Guadalcanal earlier in the day, but did not know his current whereabouts. At 01:30, he received a report from observers that there were no American vessels off Lunga Point, leading him to order his ships to begin preparations for a bombardment. By this time, &quot;Helena&quot; had already picked up Abe&#x27;s ships six minutes before at a distance of . Callaghan was not aware, as &quot;San Francisco&quot; had not yet detected the Japanese.

Both sides&#x27; destroyers encountered each other at 01:42; continued confusion on Callaghan&#x27;s part led to contradictory orders that threw the American squadron into disarray just as the two forces collided. In the ensuing close-range melee, he ordered &quot;odd ships fire to starboard, even ships fire to port&quot;, although he had not assigned any numbering system beforehand. Abe received incomplete reports from his destroyers, causing him to hesitate briefly before ordering his ships to open fire at 01:48. As the American and Japanese ships engaged each other in the chaotic battle, &quot;Helena&quot; initially engaged the destroyer , disabling her searchlight but drawing return fire that did insignificant damage. Bombarded by several other vessels, &quot;Akatsuki&quot; exploded under heavy fire and quickly sank. &quot;Helena&quot; then shifted fire to the destroyer at 02:04, only to be forced to check her fire when &quot;San Francisco&quot; passed between the two vessels. &quot;Helena&quot; nevertheless scored several hits that forced &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; to disengage; the Japanese destroyer was only saved from destruction by an attack by the destroyers , , and that caused &quot;Helena&quot; to engage them. &quot;Murasame&quot; received a hit that disabled one of her boiler rooms, forcing her to withdraw as well, while &quot;Samidare&quot; was set on fire.

During this period, one of her 40 mm guns fired at the cruiser as she steamed in the opposite direction. &quot;Helena&quot; then continued to maneuver among both sides&#x27; burning vessels, firing on a number of retreating Japanese vessels. As &quot;San Francisco&quot;, which had been badly damaged by &quot;Hiei&quot;, continued on through the melee, &quot;Helena&quot; turned to follow her to try to protect her from further harm. In the course of the 38-minute action, the American squadron was badly damaged and both Callaghan and Scott were killed in the confused fighting, the latter by friendly fire from &quot;San Francisco&quot;. &quot;Helena&quot; emerged relatively unscathed, having received five hits that did negligible damage and killed one man. Two American destroyers were sunk, three more were disabled, as were two cruisers. In return, &quot;Hiei&quot; was badly damaged and would later be scuttled after repeated American air attacks the next day prevented her withdrawal; one destroyer had been sunk and a second was badly damaged. And more importantly, Callaghan&#x27;s ships had prevented Abe from bombarding the airfield on Guadalcanal.

Hoover, the senior surviving officer in the shattered American squadron, ordered all vessels still in action to withdraw to the southeast at 02:26 while the Japanese retreated in the opposite direction. Hoover collected &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Juneau&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot;, and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; and escorted them south. At 11:00, the Japanese submarine fired a spread of torpedoes at &quot;San Francisco&quot; that missed, but one hit &quot;Juneau&quot;. The torpedo detonated one of the ship&#x27;s magazines and combined with the damage she had sustained the previous night, caused her to rapidly sink. Hoover decided that &quot;Helena&quot; was too valuable to risk stopping to pick up what he assumed to be very few survivors, and the other vessels in the group were too damaged to stop either. He instead signaled to a passing B-17 bomber, but the report of &quot;Juneau&quot;″s fate was not delivered promptly, preventing other vessels from attempting rescue operations. Admiral William Halsey subsequently relieved Hoover of command, citing his failure to ensure a prompt report of the sinking was made, to attack the submarine, or to mount rescue operations. After the war, Halsey expressed regret over the episode, noting that Hoover had been exhausted by the previous night&#x27;s fighting and that he had been motivated by the need to preserve his ship and those under his temporary command. Captain Charles P. Cecil replaced Hoover as the ship&#x27;s commander.

====Operations in 1943====
Beginning in January 1943, &quot;Helena&quot; took part in several attacks on Japanese positions on the island of New Georgia in preparation for the planned New Georgia campaign. The first of these took place from 1 to 4 January, when &quot;Helena&quot; (still as part of TF 67) covered a group of seven transports carrying elements of the 25th Infantry Division to Guadalcanal. The unit at that time included six other cruisers and five destroyers, and was commanded by RADM Walden L. Ainsworth. Ainsworth left four cruisers and three destroyers to cover the convoy on the 4th, taking &quot;Helena&quot;, her sisters and , and two destroyers to bombard Munda in the early hours of 5 January. The ships fired a total of some 4,000 shells, but inflicted little significant damage to the Japanese airfield. The ships returned to Guadalcanal at 09:00 and began recovering their reconnaissance floatplanes when a Japanese airstrike arrived and damaged two of the other cruisers, though &quot;Helena&quot; was not targeted. The ship had received the new 5-inch shells fitted with proximity VT fuses, and her use marked the first time they were used successfully in combat.

&quot;Helena&quot; and the rest of her unit then returned to Espiritu Santo to refuel and replenish ammunition, remaining there until the morning of 22 January. Halsey had ordered Ainsworth to make an attack on Vila on the island of Kolombangara to neutralize the airfield there, and on 23 January he conducted a feint toward Munda to throw off Japanese aircraft who might have launched night torpedo attacks against his vessels. As at Munda, Ainsworth left a pair of cruisers and three destroyers to provide distant support while he took &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, and four destroyers into Kula Gulf to shell the airstrip. A &quot;Black Cat&quot; PBY Catalina provided spotting support while the two cruisers fired around 3,500 shells from the main and secondary gun, inflicting significant damage on the airfield and equipment. The Japanese launched group of eleven floatplanes to scout for Ainsworth&#x27;s cruisers while a second group of thirty Mitsubishi G4M bombers, but the American ships used rain squalls to evade the floatplanes, along with long-range 5-inch fire directed by the SC and FD radars to keep the aircraft at bay. At dawn, a group of five P-38 fighters arrived to escort the ships during their continued withdrawal.

On 25 January, &quot;Helena&quot; and the rest of the squadron arrived back in Espiritu Santo. &quot;Helena&quot; continued to operate with TF 67, patrolling for Japanese vessels and escorting convoys to Guadalcanal as that campaign ground on into February. She was present as part of the distant support for the convoy operation that resulted in the Battle of Rennell Island on 29–30 January, but TF 64 was too far south to come to the aid of TF 18 during the action. On 11 February, the submarine attempted to torpedo &quot;Helena&quot; while cruising off Espiritu Santo, but the cruiser&#x27;s escorting destroyers, &quot;Fletcher&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, sank the submarine with assistance from one of &quot;Helena&quot;″s Seagull floatplanes. &quot;Helena&quot; thereafter went to Sydney, Australia, on 28 February, arriving there on 6 March for an overhaul. She was taken to the Sutherland Dock in the Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 15 March for repair work that lasted two days. She then got underway on 26 March to return north to Espiritu Santo to resume bombardment operations against New Georgia as part of what was now designated TF 68.

&quot;Helena&quot; arrived in Espiritu Santo on 30 March and rejoined Ainsworth&#x27;s unit. As the preparations for the New Georgia campaign increased, the ships made repeated patrols into the Slot. Ainsworth&#x27;s cruisers were also occupied with extensive training for the upcoming operations. While off Guadalcanal refueling from a tanker, &quot;Helena&quot; received instructions to get underway as quickly as possible, as a large Japanese airstrike was detected on radar. She and the rest of the cruiser unit steamed to the northwest of Savo Island to avoid the raid; they escaped damage, but the attack forced the Americans to cancel the planned cruiser patrol that night. On the night of 12–13 May, Ainsworth took his cruisers to shell Vila and Munda. &quot;Helena&quot; was tasked with bombarding the former and she fired a total of 1,000 shells at the island during the attack.

The invasion of New Georgia began on 30 June; &quot;Helena&quot; and the rest of TF 68 patrolled at the northern end of the Coral Sea; at that time, she cruised with &quot;St. Louis&quot;, &quot;Honolulu&quot;, and their escorting destroyer screen that consisted of &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, , , and . By 1 July, the ships were about south of New Georgia, and on 3 July they reached Tulagi, where a false report of a Japanese airstrike briefly sent the ships&#x27; crews to their battle stations. The Allied plan called for a second landing on New Georgia in the Kula Gulf on the northeastern side of the island. A landing here would block the resupply route for the Japanese forces fighting on the island and it would also deny their use of the gulf to escape once they were defeated, as they had done on Guadalcanal.

=====Landing at Rice Anchorage=====
Having attacked the Japanese positions around the Kula Gulf on several occasions, Ainsworth knew that the Japanese would be expecting further attacks as the New Georgia campaign got underway. He instructed the cruiser commanders to expect Japanese naval forces to intervene, to be prepared to evacuate damaged ships, and if necessary, to beach badly damaged vessels in the Rice Anchorage. On 4 July, the American invasion force—assault troops loaded aboard destroyer transports—departed Tulagi at 15:47, with &quot;Honolulu&quot; in the lead, followed by &quot;St Louis&quot; and &quot;Helena&quot;. The four destroyers took up positions around them to screen for submarines, while the destroyer transports sailed independently. At the same time, a group of three Japanese destroyers, , , and , left Bougainville with a contingent of 1,300 infantry aboard to reinforce the garrison on New Georgia.

&quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Strong&quot; reached Kula Gulf first, scanning it with their radar and sonar sets to determine if any Japanese warships were in the area. The cruisers and other two destroyers then entered the gulf to prepare to bombard Japanese positions at Vila. &quot;Honolulu&quot; opened fire first 00:26 on 5 July and Cecil ordered &quot;Helena&quot;″s gunners to follow suit ninety seconds later. Black Cats circling overhead coordinated the ships&#x27; fire. The other vessels quickly joined in the bombardment, which lasted about fourteen minutes before the American column turned east to move to the Rice Anchorage to shell targets there. After six minutes of shooting, the ships departed, &quot;Helena&quot; having fired over a thousand rounds of 6- and 5-inch shells in the two bombardments. During the latter period, &quot;Helena&quot;″s crew noted shell splashes from Japanese artillery batteries near the ship, but none of the American vessels were hit. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the three Japanese destroyers had arrived in the gulf while they were still shooting. Illuminated by the gun flashes, the American vessels were quickly identified by the Japanese over away.

The transport group then entered the gulf and steamed close to the shore to prevent intermingling with Ainsworth&#x27;s squadron, which had turned north at 12:39 to leave the gulf. Captain Kanaoka Kunizo, the senior destroyer commander in charge of the reinforcement operation, decided to withdraw as well to avoid engaging a superior force with his ships loaded with soldiers and supplies. &quot;Niizuki&quot;, the only radar-equipped destroyer, directed the aim of all three vessels, which launched a total of fourteen Long Lance torpedoes before withdrawing at high speed to escape back to Bougainville. One of these torpedoes struck &quot;Strong&quot;, which was still stationed at the entrance of the gulf on sentry duty. The destroyer was fatally damaged, but the attack alerted Ainsworth that there were Japanese warships in the area. &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; and &quot;Chevalier&quot; were detached to pick up survivors while Ainsworth prepared to search for the submarine he assumed to have been responsible, as none of his ships had detected the three Japanese destroyers on their radars. &quot;Strong&quot; sank at 01:22, with 239 of her crew taken off by the other destroyers, though some additional survivors were missed in the darkness and were later picked up by the transport group. Ainsworth&#x27;s ships then resumed their cruising formation at 02:15 for the voyage back to Tulagi.

During the bombardment, the shell hoist for the left gun in turret No. 5 broke down, while propellant cases repeatedly jammed in turret No. 2; work on the turrets began immediately as the vessels steamed back to Tulagi. The ammunition hoist was quickly restored to working order, but the gun in turret No. 2 took more than five hours of work before the jammed case could be removed and replaced with a modified short case that allowed the shell that was still in the gun to be fired, clearing it for normal use. At 07:00, the destroyer joined the squadron, which reached Tulagi in the early afternoon, where the ships immediately began refueling. Shortly thereafter, Ainsworth received orders from Halsey to return to Kula Gulf, as reconnaissance aircraft had spotted Japanese destroyers departing from Bougainville to attempt the planned reinforcement run that he had inadvertently disrupted the night before. Ainsworth was to intercept the destroyers and prevent the landing of more Japanese forces on the island. He ordered the ships to end refueling and prepare to get underway; &quot;Jenkins&quot; replaced &quot;Strong&quot; and the destroyer took the place of &quot;Chevalier&quot;, which had been damaged in an accidental collision with the sinking &quot;Strong&quot;.

=====Battle of Kula Gulf=====


Since the previous night&#x27;s reinforcement run had been aborted, the Japanese assembled a group of ten destroyers to make a larger effort the next night. &quot;Niizuki&quot;—now the flagship of Rear Admiral Teruo Akiyama—and the destroyers and were to escort the other seven destroyers—&quot;Nagatsuki&quot;, , , , , &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot;, and —carried 2,400 troops and supplies. Meanwhile, the American force intending to block their advance had formed up by 19:30 and began the voyage back up the Slot. As the Americans steamed toward Kula Gulf, the crews got their vessels ready for action, including closing all of the watertight doors to reduce the risk of flooding and turning off all lights to prevent detection by the Japanese.

The American squadron passed Visuvisu Point at the entrance to the gulf early on 6 July, at which point the vessels reduced speed to . Visibility was poor owing to heavy cloud cover. Ainsworth had no information as to the specific composition or location of the Japanese force, and patrolling Black Cats could not detect them in the conditions. The Japanese destroyers had already entered the gulf and begun unloading their cargoes; &quot;Niizuki&quot; detected the American ships on her radar at 01:06 at a range of about . Akiyama took his flagship, &quot;Suzukaze&quot;, and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; to observe the Americans at 01:43 while the other destroyers continued to disembark the soldiers and supplies; by that time, Ainsworth&#x27;s ships had already detected the three ships off Kolombangara at 01:36. As the two sides continued to close, Akiyama recalled the other destroyers to launch an attack. The American vessels transitioned into a line ahead formation, with &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; ahead of the cruisers; the line turned left to close the range to the Japanese vessels before turning right to move toward an advantageous firing position.

The American radars picked up Akiyama&#x27;s escort detachment along with another group of destroyers that was racing to join him; Ainsworth decided to attack the first group and then turn about to engage the second. At about 01:57, the American vessels opened up with radar-directed rapid fire. Between the three cruisers, they fired around close to 1,500 shells from their 6-inch batteries in the span of just five minutes. &quot;Helena&quot; quickly expended the flashless propellant charges that had been kept after the previous night&#x27;s bombardment mission, thereafter transitioning to normal smokeless propellant, which created large flashes every time the guns fired. &quot;Helena&quot; initially targeted the leading destroyer—&quot;Niizuki&quot;—with her main battery while her 5-inch guns engaged the following vessel. &quot;Niizuki&quot; also received heavy fire from the other American ships and was quickly sunk, taking Akiyama down with her. &quot;Helena&quot; then shifted fire to the next closest vessel, but by that time, &quot;Suzukaze&quot; and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; had both launched eight torpedoes at the American line. They then fled to the northwest, using heavy smoke to conceal themselves while their crews reloaded their torpedo tubes. Both destroyers received minor hits during their temporary withdrawal but were not seriously damaged.

Ainsworth instructed his ships to turn to the right at 02:03 to begin engaging the second group of destroyers, but shortly thereafter three of &quot;Suzukaze&quot;″s or &quot;Tanikaze&quot;″s torpedoes struck &quot;Helena&quot; on the port side, inflicting serious damage. The first torpedo hit about from the bow, abreast of the forward-most turret about below the waterline. It caused a major explosion that may have been the result of a magazine detonation. The blast destroyed the No. 1 turret, tore open the hull almost to the keel, and severed the bow from the rest of the hull. The rest of the hull began to flood as the force of the blast collapsed bulkheads below turret No. 2. But even after the severe damage inflicted by the first torpedo, the aft main guns continued to fire, and the ship had not yet been fatally damaged. She remained able to steam at 25 knots despite the increased drag.

Two minutes after the first torpedo hit, the second and third torpedoes struck the ship in quick succession, much lower in the hull than the first had hit, as much as below the waterline. This was below where the ship&#x27;s belt armor might have reduced the scale of damage inflicted. These hit further aft in the machinery spaces, breaking the keel, flooding the forward engine and boiler rooms, and breaching bulkheads that allowed water into the aft engine room. The flooding disabled the ship&#x27;s engines and left her immobilized and without electrical power. Another gaping hole had been blasted into the hull, which exacerbated the flooding caused by the first hit. It quickly became clear that &quot;Helena&quot; would not be able to survive these hits, and two minutes after the third hit, Cecil gave the order to abandon ship. He remained on the bridge with a signalman who attempted to flash a distress message with a signal lamp to no avail. Cecil then ordered another man to dump classified documents overboard before he ordered those still on the bridge to evacuate as well.

With the keel having been broken by the second and third hit, the girders that supported the hull structure began to buckle, collapsing the entire structure amidships and breaking the hull in half. The center third of the ship quickly sank but the bow and stern remained afloat for some time before flooding caused them both to point upward as they filled with water. Ainsworth and the other vessels&#x27; captains were not immediately aware that &quot;Helena&quot; had been disabled owing to the course change, the general confusion that resulted from heavy smoke and gunfire during the battle, and the fact that most attention was directed at the oncoming second group of Japanese destroyers. In the ensuing action, several of the Japanese destroyers were hit and forced to disengage, after which Ainsworth attempted to reorganize his force at around 02:30. He quickly realized that &quot;Helena&quot; was not responding to radio messages and ordered his ships to begin searching for the missing cruiser. At 03:13, &quot;Radford&quot;″s radar picked up a contact some away. The destroyer closed with it and confirmed it was &quot;Helena&quot;″s bow pointing up, out of the water.

=====Survivors=====
Ainsworth ordered &quot;Radford&quot; to immediately begin the search for survivors and shortly thereafter instructed &quot;Nicholas&quot; to join the rescue operation. Ainsworth ordered the destroyers to proceed to the Russell Islands by dawn to avoid being attacked by Japanese aircraft. The remaining pair of destroyers screened &quot;Honolulu&quot; and &quot;St. Louis&quot; as they withdrew to avoid the possibility of a retaliatory Japanese air attack. Nearly a thousand men were in the water, clinging to life rafts and waiting to be picked up by the destroyers, which reached the men at 03:41. Some men had brought flashlights when they abandoned &quot;Helena&quot; to signal their position to the destroyers. As the destroyers moved into position, their crews hung nets over the sides for survivors to climb. But shortly after the rescue effort began, &quot;Nicholas&quot;″ radar operators detected a contact approaching at high speed; both she and &quot;Radford&quot; broke off the rescue operation to prepare to engage &quot;Suzukaze&quot; and &quot;Tanikaze&quot;, both of which had turned northwest to reload their tubes after torpedoing &quot;Helena&quot;. They had returned southeast to search for &quot;Niizuki&quot; but after failing to locate her, they withdrew, having come within of &quot;Nicholas&quot;.

With the Japanese destroyers having departed, &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Radford&quot; returned to resume rescue operations at 04:15. The destroyers lowered their whaleboats to assist with the search for survivors. At 05:15, the destroyers&#x27; radar sets picked up &quot;Amagiri&quot; approaching; the latter was also searching for &quot;Niizuki&quot; when lookouts spotted the two American destroyers. &quot;Amagiri&quot; turned to engage as &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Radford&quot; did the same. &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Amagiri&quot; launched torpedoes at each other before closing and engaging with guns before &quot;Amagiri&quot; broke off and disengaged to the west. During the short engagement, the whaleboats continued to search for &quot;Helena&quot; survivors. At around 06:00, the destroyers had returned, but another radar contact—&quot;Mochizuki&quot;—again prompted their departure. A short skirmish at long range produced no results apart from further delaying rescue operations. In light of Ainsworth&#x27;s order to avoid being caught by Japanese aircraft and with daylight fast approaching, &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Radford&quot; withdrew, leaving four of their whaleboats behind to help ferry men to American positions on New Georgia. In the course of the night&#x27;s operations, &quot;Nicholas&quot; had picked up 291 while &quot;Radford&quot; had rescued 444.

Cecil, who had survived the sinking and refused to be pulled aboard one of the destroyers, instead took command of the whaleboats that remained behind. He supervised the loading of three of the boats (the fourth had broken its rudder and was of little use) to ensure that none became overloaded and capsized, and directed their route out of the gulf. Each whaleboat pulled a raft. Cecil sought to bring the flotilla away from Japanese-occupied Kolombangara to avoid drawing enemy fire. After sailing for much of the day, the boats finally reached a beach thought to be near American lines, so the boats got as close to shore as they could and the men waded ashore. They had landed at Menakasapa, a small peninsula on the northwestern side of New Georgia, some seven miles north of American lines. The men remained there overnight, as it was too late to try to pass through the dense jungle. In the meantime, another pair of destroyers, and arrived in Kula Gulf to search for survivors from &quot;Helena&quot; early on the morning of 6 July. They combed the waters at the mouth of the gulf before observers aboard the destroyers spotted the men on the beach. &quot;Gwin&quot; sailed as close to the beach as she could get at 07:45, while &quot;Woodworth&quot; covered her approach. After setting fire to the whaleboats, the &quot;Helena&quot; survivors—88 men in total—were picked up by &quot;Gwin&quot; and arrived back in Tulagi at 15:20 that day.
A significant number of men were still in the water; some life rafts remained in the area, while a number of men had climbed onto the still-floating bow or clung to pieces of floating wreckage. A B-24 Liberator heavy bomber passed the area at low altitude to search for survivors and its pilot reported seeing the men who had climbed aboard the floating bow along with other groups in the water. The bomber also dropped three life rafts, one of which sank. The survivors were subjected to brutal conditions while at sea: few provisions, no shelter from the sun, and no warmth at night when temperatures plummeted. As the day wore on, a group of about 50 men took two rafts in an attempt to reach Kolombangara, but the current proved to be too strong for them to overcome. As the day wore on, the groups of men began to drift apart; the men in one of the rafts rigged an improvised sail in an attempt to reach Vella Lavella, the next island to the west of Kolombangara. Other groups of men were pulled there by the current; as the men reached the coral reef that surrounded the island on 8 July, they were met by locals who helped pull the men to shore and put them in contact with the coastwatcher station.

The coastwatchers organized a relief effort to bring the men inland to avoid the Japanese garrison and the patrols that routinely swept the coastal areas. The Solomon Islanders gathered the groups of men as they made landfall over the course of late 7 to early 8 July and took some of them—104 in total—to the house of a Chinese merchant in the interior of the island. Others were collected at two different points on the island to hide the men from the Japanese; these two groups numbered 50 and 11, respectively. The coastwatchers contacted their superior on Guadalcanal and informed him of the situation on the island. Turner&#x27;s staff there immediately began making plans to launch a rescue operation, though the number of men to be retrieved from an enemy-occupied island complicated the effort, as the typical methods, via submarine or PT boat, would not be able to accommodate the 165 men on Vella Lavella. They settled on using a pair of destroyer transports to evacuate the men, escorted by eight destroyers. Allied naval forces had not yet penetrated as far as Vella Lavella during the campaign, which brought them dangerously close to strong Japanese naval and air forces.

The plan called for the two smaller groups, both of which were located further north than the main group, to meet inland and proceed to the coast where they would signal the waiting transports. The main group of survivors would proceed to a different evacuation point. The operation was initially planned for 12 July, but reports that Japanese vessels were operating in the area forced a postponement until the night of 15 July (and led to the Second Battle of Kula Gulf). Four destroyers took up a defensive position to the northwest to block a possible attack by Japanese forces while the rest of the force steamed to the south of Kolombangara and then north through the Vella Gulf. At 01:55 on 16 July, the men flashed the recognition signal to the waiting transports, which lowered three Higgins boats to ferry the men to the vessels. Along with the &quot;Helena&quot; survivors, the boats evacuated a downed American pilot and a captured Japanese pilot before the units moved south to the other evacuation point. Again the Higgins boats ferried the group to the transports, along with several Chinese merchants and their families. The flotilla arrived back in Tulagi that afternoon and disembarked the survivors, who were then transferred to the French colony of New Caledonia, where they met the men who had been pulled from the water on the night of the sinking. Out of a crew of almost 1,200, 168 men were killed, either during the battle or while the men were adrift.

==Aftermath==
A memorial was erected in Helena, Montana to commemorate both cruisers named &quot;Helena&quot;, CL-50 and , including artifacts from both vessels.

The wreck was discovered on 11 April 2018 by the research ship , operated by Paul Allen during an expedition to the Solomons to search for the wrecks of warships sunk during the fighting there. Allen confirmed the identity of the wreck through the hull number still visible on the stern. The wreck lies at a depth of about .

<doc id="548259" wikidata="Q211009" url="?curid=548259" title="Van Helsing (film)">
<text>Van Helsing is a 2004 action horror film written and directed by Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman as monster hunter Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious. &quot;Van Helsing&quot; is both an homage and tribute to the Universal Horror Monster films from the 1930s and 1940s (also produced by Universal Pictures which were in turn partially based on novels by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley), of which Sommers is a fan.

The eponymous character was inspired by the Dutch vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Irish author Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Distributed by Universal Pictures, the film includes a number of monsters such as Count Dracula (and other vampires), Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Duergar, Mr. Hyde and werewolves in a way similar to the multi-monster movies that Universal produced in the 1940s, such as &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot;, &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;House of Dracula&quot;. The film grossed $300.2 million worldwide against a budget of $160–170 million but was not well received by critics.

==Plot==

In 1887 Transylvania, Doctor Victor Frankenstein, aided by his assistant Igor and Count Dracula, creates a monster. Dracula kills Frankenstein when he refuses to go along with the vampire&#x27;s designs for the creature as Igor, revealed to be under Dracula&#x27;s pay, watches impassively. As a mob storms the castle, the monster flees to a windmill with Frankenstein&#x27;s body. The mob burns down the windmill, seemingly killing the monster. A year later, Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster hunter who works for the Knights of the Holy Order, an organization that protects mankind, travels to Notre-Dame de Paris and kills Dr. Jekyll after a brawl with Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing remembers nothing before he was found on the steps of a church nearly dead, and hopes to earn pardon for his forgotten sins and regain his memory.

At the Order&#x27;s Vatican City headquarters, Van Helsing is tasked with traveling to Transylvania, destroying Dracula, and protecting Anna and Velkan Valerious, the last of an ancient Romanian family. Their ancestor vowed that his descendants would kill Dracula or spend eternity in Purgatory. In Transylvania, Anna and Velkan attempt to kill a werewolf controlled by Dracula, but it falls with Velkan into a gorge, biting him as Velkan shoots it with a silver bullet.

Van Helsing and friar Carl, a weapons inventor, arrive at a village and join Anna&#x27;s fight with Dracula&#x27;s brides – Verona, Marishka, and Aleera – slaying Marishka in the process. That night, Velkan visits Anna to warn her of Dracula&#x27;s plans but transforms into a werewolf and escapes. Van Helsing and Anna pursue Velkan to Frankenstein&#x27;s castle. They stumble upon Dracula&#x27;s plan to duplicate Frankenstein&#x27;s experiments to give life to thousands of his undead children, using Velkan as a conduit.

During the fray, Dracula confronts Van Helsing, whom he regards as an ancient rival. Dracula&#x27;s spawns come to life before dying due to the lack of Frankenstein&#x27;s original formula. Van Helsing and Anna escape and, at the windmill, stumble upon Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, who reveals that he is the key to Frankenstein&#x27;s machine giving life to Dracula&#x27;s brood. Eavesdropping on their discussion, Velkan escapes with this new information.

While attempting to bring the monster to Rome, Van Helsing and his crew are ambushed by the brides and Velkan, near Budapest. Verona and Velkan are killed, but Van Helsing is bitten by the latter. Aleera kidnaps Anna and offers to trade her for the monster at a masquerade ball. Van Helsing locks the monster in a crypt, but Dracula&#x27;s allies retrieve him. Van Helsing and Carl rescue Anna and escape from the masquerade guests, who are revealed to be vampires.

At Anna&#x27;s castle, Carl explains that Dracula is the son of Valerious the Elder. When he was killed in 1462 by the &quot;Left Hand of God&quot;, Dracula made a pact with the Devil and lived again. Valerious was told to kill Dracula and gain salvation for his entire family. Unable to kill his son, he imprisoned him in an icy fortress. A fragment, which the Cardinal gave Van Helsing back in Vatican City, opens a path to Dracula&#x27;s castle.

They find the monster, who reveals that Dracula possesses a cure for lycanthropy because only a werewolf can kill him. Van Helsing, fighting the curse, sends Anna and Carl to retrieve the cure, killing Igor in the process. Van Helsing attempts to free the monster but is struck by lightning, bringing Dracula&#x27;s children to life. Dracula and Van Helsing turn into their bestial forms and battle, while Frankenstein&#x27;s monster helps Anna escape Aleera. Anna then kills Aleera with Carl&#x27;s help. Whilst both return to their human forms, Dracula reveals that Van Helsing is nothing more than a reincarnation of the archangel Gabriel who killed him and offers to restore his memory. Van Helsing refuses and kills Dracula after reverting back to his werewolf form, triggering his brood&#x27;s deaths. Anna injects the cure into Van Helsing but is killed by him in the process.

Van Helsing and Carl cremate Anna&#x27;s body on a cliff overlooking the sea. Frankenstein&#x27;s monster leaves town, and Van Helsing sees Anna&#x27;s spirit reuniting with her family in Heaven. Van Helsing and Carl ride off into the sunset.

==Cast==
==Production==
Universal Pictures wanted to reinvent their iconic movie monsters and wanted to replicate the formula that had worked for both &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001). This was not only attempted by bringing on Stephen Sommers as the director but also with the release date of May 7, 2004, which was five years to the date after &quot;The Mummy&quot; opened in 1999. &quot;The Mummy&quot; took the classic monster in an action-adventure tone, so it made sense to do the same with &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. While &quot;The Mummy&quot; was much inspired by Indiana Jones, &quot;Van Helsing&quot; drew heavily from James Bond films.

Richard Roxburgh, who was cast as Dracula, said that he loved the old Universal monster films, Klaus Kinski&#x27;s Nosferatu and Gary Oldman&#x27;s Dracula and in general likes &quot;the dark, sad, kind of naïve, Germanic type of monster movie&quot;. About his physical transformation for the role, Roxburgh said that &quot;it&#x27;s a pretty significant physical transformation. There is obviously darker hair and I wanted a sense of a Romany king or leader, a faded aristocrat. I liked that gypsy element. So the character looks nothing like me&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s original soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri.

==Merchandise==
===Video game===
Vivendi Universal Games published a &quot;Van Helsing&quot; video game for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Game Boy Advance. The game follows a similar plot to the film, has gameplay similar to &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, and the PS2 and Xbox versions feature the voice talent of many of the actors including Hugh Jackman.

===Slot games===
&quot;Van Helsing&quot; also features in a slot game produced by International Game Technology. The game is available in real-world casinos and online, though users in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, and the US are excluded from playing the online games.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $51 million at #1 during the opening weekend of May 7–9, 2004. The film eventually grossed US$300,257,475 worldwide, of which US$120,177,084 was from the US.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Van Helsing&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 24% of 224 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.28/10. The site&#x27;s consensus calls the film a &quot;hollow creature feature that suffers from CGI overload&quot;. Metacritic rated it 35/100 based on 38 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave an extremely negative review, rating the film half a star out of four and calling it &quot;the worst would-be summer blockbuster since &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;&quot;. Furthermore, he wrote: &quot;There are quite a few unintentionally funny moments, although the overall experience was too intensely painful for me to be able to advocate it as being &quot;so bad, it&#x27;s good&quot;. ... Some, however, will doubtless view it as such. More power to them, since sitting through this movie requires something more than a strong constitution and a capacity for self-torture&quot;. Bill Muller of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; gave it a rating of two out of five, explaining that the film &quot;looks like a movie assembled by a room full of computer geeks munching Doritos and playing Wolfenstein in between stints of designing Dracula&#x27;s fangs&quot;.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; greatly disliked the film: &quot;Writer-director Stephen Sommers (...) throws together plot strains from various horror movies and stories and tries to muscle things along with flash and dazzle. But his film just lies there, weighted down by a complete lack of wit, artfulness and internal logic. ... What Sommers tries to do here is use action as the only means of involving an audience. So story is sacrificed. Character development is nonexistent, and there are no attempts to incite emotion. Instead, Sommers tries to hold an audience for two hours with nothing up his sleeve but colored ribbons, bright sparklers and a kazoo. What he proves is that this is no way to make movies&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 stating that &quot;at the outset, we may fear Sommers is simply going for f/x overkill, but by the end, he has somehow succeeded in assembling all his monsters and plot threads into a high-voltage climax. &quot;Van Helsing&quot; is silly, spectacular and fun&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Spin-offs==
Sommers expanded the story of &quot;Van Helsing&quot; in two direct spin-offs:
* The animated prequel titled &quot;Van Helsing: The London Assignment&quot; takes place before the main events of the film, focusing on Van Helsing&#x27;s mission to try to stop Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from terrorizing London.
* There is also a one-shot comic book, published by Dark Horse Comics, titled &quot;Van Helsing: From Beneath the Rue Morgue&quot;, that follows Van Helsing on a self-contained adventure that occurs during the events of the film, just after the death of Jekyll/Hyde in Paris but before Van Helsing returns to Rome. In the adventure, Van Helsing deals with Doctor Moreau and his hybrid mutants.
* In April 2004, a month before &quot;Van Helsing&quot; opened in theaters, Universal Studios announced a television series titled &quot;Transylvania&quot;. The plan was to use the set from the original film, and Universal Studios paid to maintain the structures so that they could return to film there, and the series was planned to premiere on NBC in the fall of 2004. Just two weeks into &quot;Van Helsing&quot;″s release, the studio canceled the plans for the television series.

==Future==
===Cancelled sequel===
Universal Pictures was confident that &quot;Van Helsing&quot; would be a hit at the box office, and they began development on a sequel before the first film opened. They even paid to keep the original Transylvania sets, as they figured they would need to come back for it and other projects. Despite the film being a moderate success, plans for the sequel were scrapped.

===Reboot===
In May 2012, Universal Pictures announced a reboot of the film with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci to produce a modern reimagining and Tom Cruise to star as the title character and also produce the film. In October, Rupert Sanders entered early negotiations to direct the film. By November 2015, Jon Spaihts and Eric Heisserer signed onto the project as co-screenwriters, though Cruise left his role with the film. In the following year, Cruise was cast to appear in Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot;, which was released in theaters on June 9, 2017. Following the poor critical and financial reception to the film, Universal restructured their plan for rebooted adaptations of their Classic Monsters to be stand-alone in nature.

By December 2020, the reboot was back in development. Julius Avery was hired as director, in addition to doing a rewrite of an original script by Eric Pearson. James Wan was attached to serve as producer. The project will be a joint production venture between Universal Pictures and Atomic Monster.

<text>drugstore.com was an internet retailer in health and beauty care products. Its web operations were launched on February 24, 1999, and shut down on September 30, 2016 after being acquired by Walgreens in March 2011 for $409 million.

In June 1999, Rite Aid entered into a ten-year strategic relationship with Drugstore.com which allowed Drugstore.com customers to pick up prescriptions at Rite Aid stores, and enabled Drugstore.com to sell Rite Aid products, as well as vitamins from retailer General Nutrition Center (GNC). On September 3, 2008, Drugstore.com amended and restated both the main agreement and the pharmacy supply and services agreement dated June 17, 1999 between Rite Aid and Drugstore.com. Through those agreements with Rite Aid, Drugstore.com had access to Rite Aid customers through the RiteAid.com website and the Rite Aid online store, which was powered by the Drugstore.com website. Drugstore.com ended a sourcing deal with Amazon.com in 2005. In addition to the Drugstore.com website, the company also maintained storefronts at Beauty.com, VisionDirect.com, Lensmart.com, Lensworld.com, and Lensquest.com.

Its headquarters were at 411 108th Ave. NE, Suite 1600; Bellevue, WA 98004; (425) 372-3200, and the company had customer service centers in Bellevue, Washington and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

DS Distribution, Inc., located in the Pureland Industrial Complex in Logan Township, New Jersey, was its wholly owned subsidiary responsible for the distribution of OTC products, beauty.com products, and CNS (Custom Nutrition Services) products. Distribution of VisionDirect.com products is from a center in Logan Township, New Jersey. Prescriptions were handled by Walgreens.

It had an &quot;FSA store&quot; containing items that are likely to be eligible for purchase using a medical flexible spending account, and by extension a health reimbursement account or health savings account as well. This in turn led to its invention of the first inventory information approval system (IIAS) in 2005; it wasn&#x27;t used in brick-and-mortar retailing until 2006 by Walgreens. Under a 2006 Internal Revenue Service ruling, IIAS must be installed by every grocery store, discount store, and Internet pharmacy that accepts FSA debit cards by the end of 2007, and by most chain pharmacies by the end of 2008.

On December 27, 2009, Drugstore.com announced plans to acquire Salu Inc., the operator of SkinStore.com, for $36 million. The transaction completed on February 19, 2010.

On March 24, 2011, Drugstore.com was acquired by Walgreens for $409 million.

On July 28, 2016, Walgreens said it would shut down Drugstore.com and Beauty.com at the end of September, 2016, to focus on its own Walgreens.com website.

<doc id="548265" wikidata="Q2894299" url="?curid=548265" title="Peak–end rule">
<text>The peak–end rule is a psychological heuristic in which people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience. The effect occurs regardless of whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant. To the heuristic, other information aside from that of the peak and end of the experience is not lost, but it is not used. This includes net pleasantness or unpleasantness and how long the experience lasted. The peak–end rule is thereby a specific form of the more general extension neglect and duration neglect.

==Overview==

The peak–end rule is an elaboration on the snapshot model of remembered utility proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Daniel Kahneman. This model dictates that an event is not judged by the entirety of an experience, but by prototypical moments (or &quot;snapshots&quot;) as a result of the representativeness heuristic. The remembered value of snapshots dominates the actual value of an experience. Fredrickson and Kahneman theorized that these snapshots are actually the average of the most affectively intense moment of an experience and the feeling experienced at the end. The effects of the duration of an experience upon retrospective evaluation are extremely slight. Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled this phenomenon &quot;duration neglect&quot;. The peak–end rule is applicable only when an experience has definite beginning and end periods.

==Research and examples==

A 1993 study titled &quot;When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End&quot; by Kahneman, Fredrickson, Charles Schreiber, and Donald Redelmeier provided groundbreaking evidence for the peak–end rule. Participants were subjected to two different versions of a single unpleasant experience. The first trial had subjects submerge a hand in 14 °C water for 60 seconds. The second trial had subjects submerge the other hand in 14 °C water for 60 seconds, but then keep their hand submerged for an additional 30 seconds, during which the temperature was raised to 15 °C. Subjects were then offered the option of which trial to repeat. Against the law of temporal monotonicity, subjects were more willing to repeat the second trial, despite a prolonged exposure to uncomfortable temperatures. Kahneman et al. concluded that &quot;subjects chose the long trial simply because they liked the memory of it better than the alternative (or disliked it less).&quot;

Similarly, a 1996 study by Kahneman and Redelmeier assessed patients&#x27; appraisals of uncomfortable colonoscopy or lithotripsy procedures and correlated the remembered experience with real-time findings. They found that patients consistently evaluated the discomfort of the experience based on the intensity of pain at the worst (peak) and final (end) moments. This occurred regardless of length or variation in intensity of pain within the procedure.

Another study by Kahneman and Ziv Carmon identified a boundary condition for the peak–end rule. Participants interacted with a computer program that had them wait to be served, while assessing their satisfaction as they were waiting. Kahneman and Carmon found that how participants felt at the final moment of the experience was a good predictor of their responses when they were asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences. For example, participants who felt very dissatisfied during much of the experience but were satisfied in the final few seconds (because the waiting line moved faster than expected toward the end) summarized the experience as satisfying. Kahneman and Carmon concluded that real time experiences that are based on expectations are discounted after the fact if those expectations are unfulfilled.

A third study by Kahneman, Redelmeier, and Joel Katz corroborated and expanded upon the discoveries made in the 1996 study. Colonoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups. One underwent a colonoscopy procedure wherein the scope was left in for three extra minutes, but not moved, creating a sensation that was uncomfortable, but not painful. The other group underwent a typical colonoscopy procedure. Kahneman et al. found that, when asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences, patients who underwent the longer procedure rated their experience as less unpleasant than patients who underwent the typical procedure. Moreover, the patients in the prolonged discomfort group were far more likely to return for subsequent procedures because a less painful end led them to evaluate the procedure more positively than those who faced a shorter procedure.

== Causes ==

=== Memory bias for more emotional events (i.e., why the peak is memorable) ===
People exhibit better memory for more intensely emotional events than less intensely emotional events. The precise cause of this is unclear, but it has been demonstrated, for decades, across a wide variety of surveys and experiments. In addition, people do not always recognize that the events that they remember are more emotionally intense than the &quot;average&quot; event of its kind. This failure to correct for the atypicality of extreme memories can lead people to believe those extreme moments are representative of the &quot;set&quot; being judged. Boston Red Sox fans asked to recall any one game they saw when the Red Sox won, for example, tended to recall the best game they could remember. They only realized this game was unrepresentative of past winning games by the Red Sox if they were explicitly asked to recall the best game they could remember, as evidenced by their subsequent &quot;affective forecasts&quot;. This bias for more intense emotional experiences is evident in &quot;nostalgic preferences&quot;. People asked to recall a television show or movie from the past tend to recall the most enjoyable show or movie that they can remember, and use this extreme example to rate all shows from its era unless they are also able to spontaneously recall shows or movies that are worse than the first show or movie they remember.

=== Recency bias in memory (i.e., why the end is memorable) ===
People exhibit serial position effects such that they have better memory for &quot;both&quot; the beginning and end of sequences, phenomena known as primacy bias and recency bias, respectively. A paper by Garbinsky, Morewedge, and Shiv (2014) found evidence that for extended hedonic experiences, better memory for the end of the experience than the beginning (recency &gt; primacy) can be attributed to memory interference effects. As a person eats potato chips, for example, the formation of a new memory of the most recently eaten chip makes it harder for them to recall how the previously eaten chips tasted. Garbinsky and colleagues found that (1) recency effects better predicted recalled enjoyment of a small meal (e.g., eating 5 or 15 chips) than did primacy effects, (2) that people had a worse memory for the first bite of the meal than the last bite of the meal, but (3) providing people with their ratings of the first bite lead them to use their enjoyment of that first bite as much as their enjoyment of the last bite when rating their overall enjoyment of the meal.

==Applications==

===Business===
====Customer Service====
Since most consumer interactions have set beginnings and ends, they fit the peak–end model. As a consequence, negative occurrences in any consumer interaction can be counteracted by establishing a firmly positive peak and end. This can be accomplished through playing music customers enjoy, giving out free samples, or paying a clerk to hold the door for patrons as they leave. As Scott Stratten has suggested, &quot;A really great salesperson who helps with an exchange can erase negative experiences along the way. The long wait in line and the bad music in the changing room are forgotten&quot;. However, as research by Talya Miron-Shatz suggests, retrospective evaluations of day-long experiences do not appear to follow the peak–end rule, which brings into question the applicability of this rule to approximately day-length consumer–business interactions, such as hotel stays.

====Pricing Strategy====
Another business application is the price setting strategy in marketing practice. The peak-end rule suggests that reference price, an internal price benchmark, is formed as a weighted average of the highest observed price and the most recent price. Among all four reference price models (the peak-end model, extrapolative expectations model, adaptive expectations model, and rational expectations model), the peak-end model is the most plausible representation of consumer&#x27;s cognitive processes at an individual level.

De Maeyer and Estelami suggest that occasionally raising the price of the brand above the desirable level may restore the reference price for the brand. However, due to its inherent risks, this tactic may only be effective under certain circumstances. First, the tactic should be used only sparingly and for a short period. If the brand adjusts its price level too often, it could confuse customers and may be regarded as “unreliable”. A long period of exceptionally high price may distort consumers’ price perceptions on the brand and result in a loss of consumers. Second, the tactic is best suited to frequently purchased products (e.g., food, music, fragrance) where the frequency of sales minimizes the impact of the lost sale during the peak-price period.
Another study by Nasiry and Popescu examines the effect of low peak price and its interaction with loss aversion in optimal pricing strategies. They discovered that steep discounts could permanently erode demand in the future, as lowest prices remain salient in the memory anchoring process. Thus, companies should avoid deep discounts to maintain their brand price perception. They also pointed out the limitation of temporary price-raising strategy as being short-lived because these high prices affect only the reference price in the next period.

====Turnover====
A study by Kang, Daniels, and Schweitzer proposed a &quot;streak-end rule&quot; which extends the peak-end rule to sequences of binary events. They argued that, for sequences of binary events (such as workers being repeatedly assigned to do tasks that are either &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;easy&quot;), streaks are the psychological analogue of peaks. They found that volunteer workers&#x27; turnover decisions were disproportionately influenced by &quot;streaks&quot; (i.e., when a worker experienced many hard tasks in a row) and &quot;ends&quot; (i.e., when a worker&#x27;s most recent task was a hard task).

===Vacations===
In 2006, a study was carried out at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, analyzing the implications of the peak–end rule on the perceived happiness experienced on vacations. The study found that participants&#x27; remembered overall happiness was approximately predicted by the peak–end rule, although it was actually better predicted by their happiness during the &quot;most memorable or most unusual 24-h period&quot;. Still, the duration of a vacation appeared to have negligible effects on remembered happiness. The results of the study could be applied to choosing more economical durations for vacations.

===Medical procedures===
The peak–end rule is particularly salient in regard to medical procedures, since it suggests that it is preferable to have longer procedures that include a period of decreased discomfort than to have shorter procedures. In particular, the rule &quot;suggests that the memory of a painful medical treatment is likely to be less aversive if relief from the pain is gradual than if relief is abrupt&quot;. Furthermore, the quality of a remembered procedure can drastically influence medical futures. If people recall necessary but onerous procedures more positively, then they are more likely to return for repeat procedures later in life.
However, factoring the effect of the peak–end rule upon evaluations of medical procedures is problematic, since adding a period of decreasing pain to a procedure is still added pain. Even though this certainly yields a better memory of the process, the patient still endures more pain than is strictly necessary. Doctors and patients are forced to confront the choice between objectively less painful forms of treatment and forms of treatment that will be remembered more favorably. Kahneman claims that &quot;it is safe to assume that few patients will agree to expose themselves to pain for the sole purpose of improving a future memory&quot;.

===Education===
The peak-end rule also applies to educational practice, especially to peer assessment. A study by Hoogerheide and his team analyzes the effects of the peak-end rule in children&#x27;s experience of receiving peer assessments. The result shows that the peak-end rule likely influences children&#x27;s perception and memory of the assessment as well as their learning outcomes and motivation.

The study contains two experiments with different overall tones, one positive and one negative. In each experiment, students received two versions of assessments with different lengths. In the overall negative assessment, the extended version comprises an extra moderately negative rating at the end. Similarly, the extended positive assessment ends with an additional moderately positive rating. In both experiments, the students reported that the extended assessment was remembered as more pleasant and less difficult to deal with. Based on the result, Hoogerheide advises that teachers should structure the feedback by ending with the best part of the assessment. When the assessment is overall negative, it is better to end with the most pleasant or most easily acceptable part of the negative feedbacks. Similarly, the positive assessment should end on a high note rather than the most unpleasant part.

===Restaurants===
While the peak-end rule in human eating behavior may not be as general as in other contexts, studies have discovered some contextual factors that are influenced by the rule. For example, the peak-end rule works for the evaluation of food when the price is low. Conversely, for expensive food, people tend to rely on their initial experience rather than the peak or end experience. A potential reason is that high-price payers form a higher expectation on the service than low-price payers do. If their high expectation initially deviates from the actual experience, the valuation on the overall service could be driven primarily by the beginning experience. Those paying low price may not have much expectation and therefore consider the peak to be much higher than high-price payers do. Thus, they are more likely to be influenced by the peak-end rule when evaluating the overall experience.
The theory is formed in a pizza study where people chose to pay $4 or $8 for their pizza buffet. For those paid $4, both the tastes of the last and the peak slices significantly predict the general evaluation for overall food taste. In contrast, for those paid $8, the first slice is more important in predicting the overall enjoyment. Therefore, in order to maximize customer satisfaction, higher-priced restaurants should put their best food in front of the consumer first. In a buffet setting, they could provide some signage to make more popular items salient or place the most popular foods first in the line. In lower-priced restaurants, serving tasty desserts at the end may increase customer&#x27;s overall satisfaction.

The effect of the peak-end rule in eating behavior also depends on personal factors such as self-restraint level on food choice. Robinson et al. discovered that for unrestrained eaters key moments in eating experiences have a disproportionately large influence on remembered enjoyment of eating. However, restrained eaters’ judgements on food are not influenced by the peak or end of the recent eating experience but by other cognitive factors such as semantic knowledge and beliefs about food that are already formed.

==Criticism==
Critiques of the peak–end rule typically derive from its conflation of a complex mental evaluation into a simplistic framework. A 2008 study found some support for the peak–end rule, but also found that it was &quot;not an outstandingly good predictor&quot; of remembered experiential value, and that the happiness of the most memorable part of an experience predicted remembered happiness better than did the happiness of the peak or of the end. Additionally, the extreme effect of peaks fades more rapidly over time, causing peaks to be recalled less positively and troughs recalled less negatively over time. Episodic memory endures for only a few weeks; at some point, mental accounting shifts over to semantic memory, leading to potential over-valuation of the &quot;end&quot; and diminished weighting of the peak. Additionally, memories that are available for evaluation may change due to the fading affect associated with memory or differing goals in recall. Goal orientation or initial expectations can also affect the weighting of a peak or an end, causing an end to be over-weighted as the culmination of a goal. Finally, Ariely and Carmon have theorized that evaluations of past events are affected by feelings at the time of evaluation.

<text>&quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot; (alternatively Iron Bottom Sound or Ironbottomed Sound or Iron Bottom Bay) is the name given by Allied sailors to the stretch of water at the southern end of The Slot between Guadalcanal, Savo Island, and Florida Island of the Solomon Islands, because of the dozens of ships and planes that sank there during the naval actions comprising the Battle of Guadalcanal during 1942–1943. Before the war, it was called Savo Sound. Every year on the battle&#x27;s anniversary, a US ship cruises into the waters and drops a wreath to commemorate the men who lost their lives. For many Navy sailors, and those who served in the area during that time, the waters in this area are considered sacred, and strict silence is observed as ships cruise through.

<text>Recreational Equipment, Inc., doing business as REI, is an American retail and outdoor recreation services corporation. It was formerly governed, and continues to brand itself, as a consumers&#x27; co-operative. REI sells camping gear, hiking, climbing, cycling, water, running, fitness, snow, travel equipment, and men, women and kids clothing. Unlike other outdoor sports stores, it does not sell hunting or fishing equipment.

REI operates 181 retail stores in 41 states. It also receives orders via mail-order catalogs and the internet.

==History==
Lloyd (1902–2000) and Mary (Gaiser) Anderson (1909–2017) founded REI in Seattle, Washington in 1938. The Andersons had imported an Akadem Pickel ice axe from Austria, for themselves, as part of The Mountaineers Basic Climbing Course; from there, the two decided to set up a co-operative to help other outdoor enthusiasts in the club acquire good-quality climbing gear at reasonable prices. On June 23, 1938, with the aid of Seattle attorney Ed Rombauer, five Mountaineers met at Rombauer&#x27;s office, and each paid one dollar to join the Recreational Equipment Cooperative. 
During their first year, Recreational Equipment was a shelf at the Puget Sound Cooperative Store, a farmer&#x27;s co-op near Pike Place Market in Seattle. In 1942, Lloyd moved to a new space, down the hall from The Mountaineers’ club rooms on Pike Street. Jim Whittaker was hired as the first full-time employee at REI in July 1955. In 1956, Recreational Equipment Cooperative was incorporated. Whittaker served as CEO during the 1960s and was an early board member, along with American Alpine Club president, Nicholas Clinch. When Whittaker became the first American to summit Mount Everest in May of 1963, it provided REI with so much free advertising that, the following year (1964), the company’s gross income topped $1mil for the first time.

Through the 1970s, REI identified itself prominently as REI Co-op, focusing primarily on equipment for serious climbers, backpackers, and mountaineering expeditions. Later on, in the 1980s, and with changes to their board of directors, REI’s emphasis expanded to also include camping, kayaking, bicycling, and other outdoor activities. The company acquired nearby outdoor gear firm Mountain Safety Research in 1981, which later bought tent-maker Edgeworks and produced tents with the MSR brand. REI kept MSR until 2001, when it exited the manufacturing business, selling the operation to Cascade Designs, another successful outdoor gear company in the Seattle area. Clothing, particularly &quot;sport-casual&quot; apparel, also became a greater part of the company&#x27;s product line. Although the company remained a co-operative, providing special services to its members, the &quot;co-op&quot; moniker was dropped from much of its literature and advertising. Beginning in 2014, with the introduction of the REI Co-Op line of clothing, REI publicly re-emphasized the cooperative aspect of its business model. In October 2015, the company launched a redesigned logo, which included the word &quot;co-op&quot; for the first time since 1983.

Sally Jewell joined the board of REI in 1996 and, in 2000, was named chief operating officer. She then became CEO in 2005. Jewell remained CEO of REI until she was named United States Secretary of the Interior in April of 2013. She was succeeded by Jerry Stritzke, former president and COO of Coach New York, who was named president and CEO of REI in August 2013. Stritzke resigned in February 2019. Eric Artz, previously COO of the company, was named CEO and president of REI in May 2019. In January 2025, Artz announced his retirement to be effective in March 2025. He will be succeeded as CEO by Mary Beth Laughton, who was previously the board director for REI.

After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, REI joined the 2018 NRA boycott and suspended orders from Vista Outdoor, a maker of outdoor products and rifles.

On Black Friday of 2015, REI &quot;did the unexpected&quot; by closing all of their stores and temporarily halting the processing of online purchases, giving all of their employees a paid day off. Although Black Friday has, traditionally, been one of REI&#x27;s top-10 days for annual sales, the company abstained from Black Friday and launched an #OptOutside marketing campaign, urging people to spend their time outside. REI is the first major US retailer to forgo operations on Black Friday. They continued the initiative through the 2022 holiday season.

On January 31, 2023, REI laid off 8 percent of its corporate staff, eliminating 167 positions. The layoffs were attributed to the need to return REI to profitability amidst a challenging economic environment, with the company experiencing a decline in outdoor gear sales following a pandemic boom.

In January 2025, REI announced that it would lay off 400+ employees, ending its unprofitable REI Experiences classes, day tours and adventure tourism packages.

== Non-retail diversification ==

REI diversified its offerings into global adventure vacations through the REI Adventures branch, which began in 1987. REI Adventures offered vacations for active travelers all over the world. 

In 2006, REI started the Outdoor School in selected markets. The Outdoor School is a series of one-day outings in the local area and in store classes. Offerings include mountain biking, road biking, kayaking, backpacking, rock climbing, outdoor photography, family hiking, snowshoeing and others. The current locations of the Outdoor School are the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento and Reno areas, the Los Angeles area, the San Diego area, Boston and New England area, New York Tri-State area, Philadelphia, Washington D.C./Maryland/Virginia area, Chicago area, Minneapolis area, Denver area, Atlanta area, Portland area, and Puget Sound area.

On June 11, 2015, REI bought &quot;Adventure Projects Inc.&quot;, a Boulder-based company, founded by Nick Wilder and Mike Ahnemann in 2012, which is best known for its climbing website, Mountain Project (MountainProject.com), with guides to more than 128,000 climbing routes across the world. It has since expanded by creating MTBProject.com, a website for mountain bike trail maps, HikingProject.com, for hiking trails, PowderProject.com, for backcountry skiing trails, and TrailRunProject.com, for cross-country running trails.

On January 8th, 2025, it was announced they were ending the &#x27;Experiences&#x27; businesses, laying off hundreds of employees. REI’s president and CEO, Eric Artz, announced the news on Jan. 8 in an email to employees. Artz said that the Experiences business served only 40,000 customers in 2024, less than 0.4% of all co-op customers, and was unprofitable.

==Location==
REI has a member owned co-operative headquartered in Kent, Washington. It is owned by its members, who each hold a single voting share. Members are entitled to a patronage dividend. A new headquarters campus in the Spring District of Bellevue, Washington, was announced in 2016 and planned to open in 2020. The sale of the new headquarters campus was announced in August 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with REI corporate employees shifting to remote work.

The company has five flagship stores in major U.S. cities that include event rooms and indoor climbing walls. Their Seattle flagship, in the Cascade neighborhood of Downtown Seattle, opened in 1996. It was followed by flagship locations in Bloomington, Minnesota; the Uline Arena in Washington, D.C.; New York City; and Denver, Colorado.

==Membership==
REI is owned by its active members, persons who have paid a lifetime membership fee, which is currently $30. Each active member is entitled to vote for members of the company&#x27;s board of directors, from among candidates approved by the incumbent board. Members are also eligible to receive a patronage &quot;dividend&quot; on qualifying purchases; this dividend is issued as store credit, not redeemable in currency. The lifetime fee was just five dollars in 1985.

The annual reward is normally equal to 10% of what a member spent at REI on regular-priced merchandise in the prior year; it has no numerical relationship to REI&#x27;s profits.

==Governance==

REI is a Washington corporation governed by a board of 13 directors, including the CEO. Directors serve for terms of one or three years. Board candidates are selected by the REI Board Nomination and Governance Committee. In earlier years, board elections were competitive elections, with both board-nominated and self-nominated petition candidates. In recent years, REI eliminated the opportunity for petition candidates and has nominated only as many candidates as open positions. Members are mailed a ballot, and nominees must garner 50% of returned ballots; members may also vote online. While theoretically the board serves at the members&#x27; pleasure, there is no path to board membership without the approval of the Board Nomination and Governance Committee, and the incumbent Board has the right to fill by appointment any Board seats not filled by election. For 2014, its chief executive officer received compensation of approximately $2.71 million per year.

==Labor==
REI employed over 15,000 people as of January 2022, most of them in its stores, many of whom are part-time. Employees receive discounts on merchandise, may be eligible for free or discounted outdoor classes, and also receive a &quot;Way day&quot; pass, entitling them to spend up to 6 hours outdoors for pay. REI has been ranked in the top 100 Companies to Work For in the United States by &quot;Fortune&quot; since 1985, which earned it a place in the &quot;Fortune&quot; &quot;Hall of Fame.&quot; REI ranked as #8 in 2012, #69 in 2014, #58 in 2015, #26 in 2016, and #28 in 2017.

=== Labor organizing and criticism ===

Since 2013, REI workers have been publicly organizing around workplace issues such as living wages, erratic and insufficient scheduling, access to benefits like healthcare, and safety protocols. While the cooperative does not currently have any trade unions, the company has been accused of union busting by forcing employees to attend captive audience meetings, putting up anti-union flyers, and using &quot;social justice language&quot; and its status as a retail cooperative to mislead the public into believing it is a worker cooperative. 

Workers have organized at least 5 petitions since 2016, and in January 2022, the SoHo, Manhattan location filed REI&#x27;s first-ever National Labor Relations Board petition to vote to become a union. In March 2022, the SoHo based workers voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionization with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) by a vote of 88-14. In March 2023, REI workers in Orange, Ohio, voted to unionize by a vote of 27-12. In April, its Eugene, Oregon, location filed a petition for union elections with the National Labor Relations Board. In May 2023 the company&#x27;s Durham, North Carolina, store&#x27;s workers voted 20-12 to unionize with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, after a four-day strike precipitated by the co-op&#x27;s alleged retaliation against a union organizer. Durham&#x27;s thus became the sixth REI store to unionize. 

As of April 2024, the unionized stores within REI had yet to successfully negotiate a contract.

In November 2023, workers at eight REI retail stores accused the company of dozens of violations of federal labor law, including retaliating against pro-union workers, altering working conditions without union consultation, and refusing to bargain in good faith with unions at stores that had voted in favor of unionization.

== Environmental and community initiatives ==
To support local communities, REI offers meeting space free of charge to non-profit organizations, supports conservation efforts, and organizes yearly outdoor service outings. REI donates annually to conservation groups in the US. Its 2007 giving of $3.7 million represented about 0.28% of its $1.3 billion in gross sales.

<text>Lucette Michaux-Chevry (5 March 1929 – 9 September 2021) was a French politician, who served as President of the Regional Council of the overseas department of Guadeloupe between 1992 and 2004. She was nicknamed the &quot;Iron Lady of the Caribbean.&quot; because she was &quot;for a long time the strong woman of the department.&quot;

== Life and work ==
Michaux-Chevry was born in 1929 in Saint-Claude, Guadeloupe, as the fourth of ten children, and completed her law studies at the Sorbonne University in Paris.

She was the first Guadeloupean woman to enter government service when she won her first election in 1959 becoming a municipal councilor for her town of Saint-Claude. She won just eight days after the birth of her son.

=== Political achievements ===
An ardent member of the Socialist Party, Michaux-Chevry supported French presidential candidate Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in 1981. She was elected to the post of Regional President in 1992 for the first time, then reelected in January 1993, and in 1995. She was elected Mayor of Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. She was elected to the French senate 1995, and also in 1995, French president Jacques Chirac named her an advisor.

According to her obituary in Le Monde,She did not abandon her native Guadeloupe, where she multiplied the mandates almost until the end of her life: she was in total three times mayor (Gourbeyre, then Basse-Terre), twice senator (from 1995 to 2011), twice deputy (from 1986 to 1993) and twice president of the region (from 1992 to 2004). In January 2019, she resigned from the presidency of the agglomeration community Grand Sud Caraïbe and announced, at nearly 90 years old, to put an end to her political career, causing an earthquake locally.However, Michaux-Chevry did not leave politics totally. After she resigned her presidency post in 2019, she retained another position as deputy to the mayor of Basse-Terre. At the time, the mayor was her daughter Marie-Luce Penchard,

=== Personal life ===
Lucette was married at a young age to printer Henri Michaux but became a widow when her two children were still young.

Her daughter, Marie-Luce Penchard, became a minister under the Nicolas Sarkozy presidency, and like her mother, she has pursued a career in local and national politics.

=== Death and tributes ===
Michaux-Chevry died on 9 September 2021at her home in Gourbeyre, Guadeloupe from throat cancer, at the age of 92.

<text>Stephen Lamont Davis (born March 1, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

==Early life==
A native of Spartanburg, South Carolina, Davis attended Spartanburg High School, where he excelled in football and track. At the 1991 South Carolina state meet, he set a state record in the 100 metres with 10.40 seconds. His record stood for 17 years, until Marcus Rowland ran a 10.35 at the 2008 state meet.

Regarded as the No. 1 recruit in the nation in 1992, Davis was named &quot;USA Today&quot; Offensive High School Football Player of the Year.

==College career==
Davis played three years (1993, 1994, 1995) for Auburn University, starting in his sophomore year. He made the All-SEC team his last two seasons and graduated as the team&#x27;s fourth all-time leading rusher behind Joe Cribbs, James Brooks, and Bo Jackson. He was also a letterman for all three seasons.

Davis currently holds the record for rush attempts (1,945), rush yards (8,052) and rushing TDs (65) amongst all Auburn alumni in NFL history.

==Professional career==

===Washington Redskins===
Davis was drafted in the fourth round (103rd overall) in the 1996 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins. Davis was primarily used as a fullback, and was part of the Redskins&#x27; backfield with Terry Allen. He spent three seasons as a backup and fullback before getting the starting nod at the start of the 1999 NFL season. This was Davis&#x27; breakout season, when he posted career highs, and ended up representing the NFC in the Pro Bowl. He led the NFC in yards rushing with 1,405, and led the league in yards per carry (4.8). He was also the league&#x27;s leading non-kicking scorer, posting 108 points on 17 touchdowns and one two-point conversion. He continued to post high numbers the following season en route to his second straight Pro Bowl selection. In 2001, Davis rushed for 1,432, breaking the record he had set in 1999 for most rushing yards in a season by a Redskin.

Said Football Outsiders about Davis&#x27;s 1999 season, &quot;Stephen Davis was just a monster in 1999 with 1407 yards (second in the league) and 17 touchdowns (nobody else scored more than 13). He led the league with a 60% success rate, and nobody else with at least 75 carries was over 55%.&quot;

===Carolina Panthers===
Davis signed with the Carolina Panthers for the start of the 2003 NFL season, and was a catalyst in leading the team to Super Bowl XXXVIII. Davis rushed for a career-high 1,444 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. Davis led all rushers in the postseason with 315 yards. Unfortunately for Davis, he suffered an injury early the following season, and was one of fourteen Panthers on injured reserve as the Panthers struggled to a 7–9 record. He was also on the injured list early in the 2005 season, but came off the bench after a few games before being forced to sit out the remainder of the season with nagging knee injuries. Davis was released by the Panthers on March 1, 2006.

===St. Louis Rams===
On August 24, 2006, Davis worked out with the St. Louis Rams and was offered a one-year contract, which he accepted.

===Retirement===
On February 27, 2008, Davis signed a one-day contract with Carolina so he could officially retire as a Panther; he did so the next day on February 28, 2008. Later, in 2012, he came forth with reports about suffering from tinnitus and other concussion related side effects.

Davis was the Carolina Panthers&#x27; minority coaching intern for the 2010–11 season.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Franchise records ===
 off-season, Davis held at least 8 Panthers records, including:
* Rush attempts, season (318 in 2003), playoff season (64 in 2003)
* Rush yards, playoff season (315 in 2003)
* Yards per carry, playoff career (4.92)
* Yards per game, career (71.9), season (103.1 in 2003), playoff career (78.8)
* 100+ yard rushing games, season (8 in 2003; with DeAngelo Williams)

Dame Darcy&#x27;s autobiographical graphic novel, &quot;Hi Jax &amp; Hi Jinx (Life&#x27;s a Pitch and Then You Live Forever)&quot;, was published by Feral House in 2019 Other graphic novels include &quot;Handbook for Hot Witches&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Frightful Fairytales&quot;, &quot;Gasoline&quot;, and &quot;Dollerium&quot;.

In the late 1990s director Lisa Hammer and Dame Darcy produced a variety TV show titled &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot; profiling their short &quot;silent film&quot; style movies for Manhattan public access, which is now part of the Getty Museum Collection. &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot; is currently streaming on Night Flight Plus as of 2024.

== Biography ==
Dame Darcy acquired her initial skill set while still a child and teen working as an apprentice to her father in his sign-painting studio, Green Tree Graphics. She began her own career at age 17 when she won a scholarship to the San Francisco Art Institute. During this time, she acted in films by George Kuchar.

She made her first publishing deal at the age of 21 when her comic book series &quot;Meat Cake&quot; was picked up by Fantagraphics Books. She originally considered using the pen name &quot;Richard Dirt&quot; but her father suggested adding a title to her own first name instead, so Darcy used the name Richard Dirt as a character in her comic book.

She performed for a time with Lisa Crystal Carver and Jean-Louis Costes&#x27;s underground cabaret Suckdog Circus. &quot;SUCKDOG Reunion Tour 2016&quot;, a documentary concert film starring Lisa Carver (Lisa Suckdog) as &quot;The Dish&quot; and Dame Darcy as &quot;Ghost Mother&quot; is currently available as a DVD.

Her latest books as of 2016 are &quot;Lady Killers&quot; (Harper Collins), &quot;The Jaywalker&quot;, with Lisa Carver, &quot;Lucky&quot;, and other compilations. Dame Darcy&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Hi Jax &amp; Hi Jinx&quot;, was published by Feral House in 2019, and has a feature film screenplay attached. Her self-published &quot;Mermaid Tarot and Queen Alice&quot; tarot card decks are independently distributed.

She has illustrated for fashion designers Anna Sui and Gothic Lolita designers CWC, Baby Doll, Ku, Coi Girl Magic and Jared Gold while working as a runway model in NYC and LA.

In the 1990s, Dame Darcy made a doll for Courtney Love which included hair from the late Kurt Cobain. The doll was a gift to Love&#x27;s daughter Frances Bean Cobain. Dame Darcy planned to auction some of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s leftover hair in 2015 but withdrew it following a complaint from Love.

Her teaching experience varies among all ages and contexts. Dame Darcy taught an independent comics publishing course at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, as well as lecturing and workshops at Columbia University, and in Europe and Japan.

Dame Darcy is married to J. Pleasant as of 2023.

<text>Eddie Bauer LLC is an American outdoor recreation brand and chain store headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States. Eddie Bauer sells its merchandise via retail stores, outlet stores, online, and via telephone. The company also licenses the &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot; brand name and logo for various products sold through other companies including eyewear, furniture, bicycles, and, up until the 2010 model year, upper level versions of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Bronco, Explorer, Expedition and Excursion SUVs.

The company was established in 1920 in Seattle by Pacific Northwest outdoorsman Eddie Bauer (1899–1986). In 1940, Bauer patented the first quilted down jacket. Bauer retired and sold the company to his partner in 1968. General Mills bought the company in 1971 and Spiegel acquired it from General Mills in 1988. In 2003, Spiegel filed bankruptcy and in May 2005, it emerged from bankruptcy under the name &quot;Eddie Bauer Holdings, Inc.&quot;. On June 17, 2009, Eddie Bauer filed bankruptcy and was acquired by Golden Gate Capital the following month. In 2021, it was acquired by Authentic Brands Group and SPARC Group LLC.

==History==

===1920–1949: Eddie Bauer&#x27;s Sport Shop===
In 1920, at the age of 21, Eddie Bauer, established his first store in downtown Seattle, &quot;Eddie Bauer&#x27;s Tennis Shop&quot;, in the back of a local hunting and fishing store. He first specialized in building and repairing tennis rackets and the shop was only open during the tennis season; Bauer spent the rest of the year pursuing his own sportsman activities. Bauer expanded his line of merchandise to include his own hand-made golf clubs and fishing tackle and he changed the name of his store to &quot;Eddie Bauer&#x27;s Sport Shop&quot;. Bauer developed and patented a standardized shuttlecock in 1934. The Bauer Shuttlecock popularized badminton in the United States. While operating this first store, Bauer developed his creed, &quot;To give you such outstanding quality, value, service and guarantee that we may be worthy of your high esteem&quot;, still used by the modern company.

====The Skyliner====
While on a winter fishing trip in Washington, Eddie Bauer developed hypothermia. He then began trying to develop alternatives to heavy wool garments used by outdoorsmen at the time. He attempted to offset the bulkiness of down by quilting a down jacket. In 1940, Bauer patented the first quilted goose down-insulated jacket in the United States: and introduced it in his store as &quot;The Skyliner&quot;. Bauer received over 20 patents on various outdoor clothing and sporting equipment between 1934 and 1937.

====U.S. Army Air Corps commission====
In 1942, the United States Army Air Corps commissioned Eddie Bauer to develop the B-9 Flight Parka. More than 50,000 parkas were manufactured for airmen during World War II. The parka was designed to keep pilots warm at high altitudes. Of all government suppliers, only Eddie Bauer was granted permission to affix his company logo to his products used by the United States Army. In addition to the parkas, Eddie Bauer supplied the army with backpacks, pants and sleeping bags, all of which became standard issue for American troops in the war. Prior to his involvement, the United States Army had a shortage in sleeping bags; Bauer eventually sold over 100,000 sleeping bags to the United States Army.

====Mail-order catalog====
In 1945, soon after he began selling women&#x27;s clothing as well as men&#x27;s, Eddie Bauer issued his first mail order catalog. The original mailing list included the names of 14,000 soldiers who had worn Eddie Bauer clothing provided by the United States Army during their service. By 1949, Bauer employed 125 seamstresses. He closed his downtown store and got out of retailing, except for showroom sales at his Seattle factory.

===1950–1959: William F. Niemi partnership===
By 1950, Eddie Bauer&#x27;s health was declining due to overwork and a serious back injury. Bauer transferred all of the common stock in Eddie Bauer, Inc., to his hunting partner, William F. Niemi, who reorganized the store and improved cash flow.

By 1953, catalog sales totaled US$50,000. At this point, Bauer returned to being a shareholder in the company and formed a 50-50 partnership with Niemi. During the 1950s, the company supplied outwear for many scientific and exploratory expeditions.

In 1960, Eddie Bauer and William Niemi took on their sons, Eddie C. Bauer and William Niemi Jr. as partners in the company.

The company supplied equipment for the American K2 Himalayan Expedition and several journeys through Antarctica. In 1963, despite being an employee of REI, Jim Whittaker, the first American to climb Mount Everest, wore an Eddie Bauer parka and other company products during his expedition.

====Retirement of Eddie Bauer====
In 1968, Eddie Bauer retired and he and his son sold their half of the business to William Niemi, his son, and their investors for $1.5 million. That same year the first store outside of Seattle opened, in San Francisco.

In 1970, the company&#x27;s first large store opened in downtown Seattle. In order to appeal to a broader range of consumers, Niemi shifted the company&#x27;s focus featuring casual lifestyle apparel. The emphasis on women&#x27;s apparel and accessories was also greatly expanded in all stores.

===1971–1987: General Mills and Ford Eddie Bauer branding===
In 1971, William Niemi sold the company to General Mills. After the sale, the company shifted its focus to casual clothing and expanded to 61 stores and made $250 million in sales by 1988. This shift included the company dropping the tagline &quot;Expedition Outfitter.&quot;

In 1987, Eddie Bauer introduced the &quot;All Week Long&quot; concept. This was meant to provide women with clothing they could wear throughout the week, including at work, as opposed to just weekend wear. This concept was sold solely through the catalog until the first All Week Long store opened in Portland, Oregon in the summer of 1991.

In 1983, Eddie Bauer began a cross-branding partnership with Ford Motor Company to produce Eddie Bauer Edition Ford vehicles. In 1984, the first Eddie Bauer Edition Ford debuted: the limited edition &quot;Eddie Bauer Bronco.&quot; The partnership ended in 2010, with the 2010 Explorer and Expedition the last two models available in Eddie Bauer edition.

The following Ford vehicles were available in Eddie Bauer editions:
* Ford Bronco (1984–1996)
* Ford Bronco II (1984–1990)
* Ford Explorer (1991–2010)
* Ford Expedition (1997–2010)
* Ford F-150 (1994–1996)

In 1991, Eddie Bauer launched Eddie Bauer Home, a collection of home furnishings, including furniture, tableware, decor items and linens. The collection was meant to appeal to the customers that purchased apparel from the company. The home store maintained a &quot;warm and cozy&quot; theme by presenting beds with thick blankets and floors covered with wool rugs.

In 1995, in partnership with American Forests, the company launched the &quot;Add a Dollar, Plant a Tree&quot; retail program in which it offered to plant a tree every time a customer donated a dollar.
In 1996, Eddie Bauer launched its website. The company launched the EBTEK product line, including outerwear and casual activewear made of Gore-Tex, Polartec 200, and Eddie Bauer Premium Goose Down.

Also in 1999, the one-millionth Eddie Bauer Edition Ford rolled off the assembly line.

In October 2000, Eddie Bauer launched its first exclusively on-line business venture, eddiebauerkids.com.

In January 2001, Eddie Bauer teamed with American Recreation Products through a licensing agreement to launch a collection of camping equipment to be sold by Target Corporation.

====Bankruptcies and reorganization====
In March 2003, Spiegel filed for bankruptcy. It sold its flagship catalog business and its Newport News women&#x27;s apparel unit and announced that Eddie Bauer Inc. was up for auction. More than 200 Eddie Bauer stores were closed. The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters, in Redmond, Washington, was sold to Microsoft for $38 million.

Despite interest from companies including L.L. Bean, Bain Capital, and Cerberus Capital Management, Spiegel pulled Eddie Bauer from auction due to lack of a satisfactory offer. Spiegel then reorganized around the Eddie Bauer business with Eddie Bauer emerging as a standalone company owned partially by Fidelity Investments (11%), Bank of America (6.9%), and J.P. Morgan Chase (6.2%). In May 2006, the company hired Goldman Sachs to explore a possible future sale.

In 2009, the company launched a new line of clothing called FirstAscent that underwent testing under extreme conditions first on Mount Rainier, then on Cotopaxi in Ecuador and finally on Aconcagua in Argentina.

On June 17, 2009, Eddie Bauer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company was acquired at bankruptcy auction by Golden Gate Capital in July 2009 with a winning bid of $286 million.

==Legal issues==
===Dismissed lawsuit over deceptive promotions===
In July 2020, Jackie Fisher, an Eddie Bauer client, dismissed his allegations claiming the company fooled outlet consumers with fake promotions and made-up comparison prices. Fisher said he had purchased jackets on sale because the advertising made it appear that he was getting a great deal.

==Joint ventures==

==Supplier of clothing in expeditions==
Eddie Bauer supplied clothing for several notable mountain expeditions:

* The 1953 American Karakoram expedition was the fifth attempt since 1909 to climb K2. Team member Art Gilkey died in an apparent avalanche during the team&#x27;s descent. His body was lost until 1993 when it emerged from the glacier about a mile from the base camp. Gilkey was still wearing his red Eddie Bauer down parka, an item that was standard issue for the members of the expedition.

* On 5 July 1958, Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman were the first men to stand atop Gasherbrum I, the 11th highest mountain in the world. Eddie Bauer supplied the eight man American expedition with &quot;Kara Koram Parkas&quot; that utilized a ripstop nylon shell.

* On 1 May 1963, around 1:00 pm Jim Whittaker, who worked for REI and was outfitted in Eddie Bauer outerwear, became the first American to stand atop Mount Everest. The American Mount Everest Expedition had to walk the 180 miles from Kathmandu, Nepal, to base camp with 27 tons of gear, which took a month and 900 porters. At the end of April, expedition leader Norman Dyhrenfurth informed Whittaker that he and Nawang Gombu Sherpa will make the first summit attempt.

* Three weeks after Whittaker and Gombu reached the top of Everest, four other team members followed suit on 22 May. The four were forced to bivouac and used their Eddie Bauer down clothing for shelter.

* In 1965, Mount Kennedy was North America&#x27;s highest unclimbed peak. The National Geographic Society asked Jim Whittaker to lead an expedition to Mount Kennedy in Canada&#x27;s Yukon. Whittaker&#x27;s team included Senator Robert F. Kennedy who, on 24 March became the first man to reach the summit.

* In 1958 and 1965, Eddie Bauer went to the South Pole as part of scientific expeditions. In 1966 the American Antarctica Mountaineering Expedition set out to climb the major Antarctic peaks. All the climbs were successful making first ascents of the six highest mountains in the Sentinel Range. One of the first ascents took place on December 18 when Pete Schoening, William Long, James Corbet and John Evans reached the summit of Vinson Massif, one of the world&#x27;s &quot;Seven Summits&quot; and Antarctica&#x27;s highest mountain. Expedition leader, Nicholas Clinch wrote a letter to Eddie Bauer from Vinson Camp II stating
* Dr. James Morrissey led the American Dhaulagiri Expedition that set out to summit the 7th highest mountain in the world. Eddie Bauer developed the Kara Koram Expedition pants for the Dhaulagiri expedition as well as providing the team with Kara Koram Expedition parkas and sleeping bags. On 12 May 1973, John Roskelley and Louis Reichardt made the first American ascent of Dhaulagiri with Nawang Samden Sherpa. They did so without using supplemental oxygen making Dhaulagiri the highest peak at the time to be summited without bottled oxygen.

* In the summer of 1977, Galen Rowell organized a 6-man expedition to Great Trango Tower, a 20,623-foot unclimbed granite spire in Pakistan. Expedition member, John Roskelley wrote to Eddie Bauer requesting that he be able to use the down gear originally intended for an unsuccessful spring expedition to Makalu on the Trango expedition and the company agreed. On 21 July, all five climbers of the expedition were the first in history to reach the summit of Great Trango Tower.

<text>Jeffery Paine is a writer recognized for his work in bringing Eastern culture and spirituality to popular audiences in the West. &quot;Jeffery Paine is an unusual voice in American letters,&quot; observed Indian novelist and Underscretary General of the United Nations Shashi Tharoor, &quot;one steeped in the wisdom of the East and yet infused with a knowing and witty sensibility that is profoundly Western.&quot; Paine&#x27;s books, such as &quot;Father India&quot; and &quot;Re-enchantment&quot;, have been named by publications ranging from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; to &quot;Spirituality &amp; Health&quot; as &quot;Best Book of the Year.&quot; His writing falls in the category of creative or literary nonfiction, which unites original scholarship with the dramatic narrative and character development associated with a novel.

==Biographical==
Paine was born midcentury in Houston and grew up in Goose Creek and Baytown, Texas. He studied history at Rice University and received his PhD in crosscultural intellectual history from Princeton University. When he began writing he supported himself by managing hotels in America and Europe, including the oldest hotel in Amsterdam, and afterwards by working in advertising and public relations. He was later the editor-in-chief of Universal Reference Publishers and literary editor of the magazine the &quot;Wilson Quarterly&quot;.

He has received fellowships from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the American Institute of Indian Studies, and from the Templeton Foundation to study Tibetan medicine at Cambridge University. During the 1990s he was regularly a visiting fellow at the East–West Center in Honolulu and subsequently had residencies at Yaddo, the MacDowell Colony, and the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center. Paine has been a guest professor at Princeton University, San Francisco State University, the New School for Social Research, the Volksuniversiteit Amsterdam, and the University of Minnesota.

==Major works==
In &quot;Father India&quot; (1998) Paine revealed the 20th Century Euro-American encounter with India through a different lens, in a new light. Through a series of dramatic biographies, extending from Lord Curzon and Gandhi through E. M. Forster and V. S. Naipaul, Paine showed that our everyday assumptions, what unquestioningly we take for granted about politics, religion, and psychology, often have entirely unexpected outcomes when they get immersed in a radically different culture. In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, the novelist Bharati Mukerjee called the work &quot;groundbreaking&quot; in how it gave a whole new understanding of modern India vis-à-vis the West.

In &quot;Re-enchantment: Tibetan Buddhism Comes to the West&quot;&#x27; (2004) Paine traced the historical story of how a religion, once dismissed as black magic and seemingly doomed after the Chinese conquest of Tibet, against all odds resurrected itself as a world religion and renovated itself along the cutting edge of spirituality. Harvey Cox of Harvard University and author of &quot;The Secular City&quot;, said, &quot;This is just the book on Buddhism I had hoped someone would write but was afraid they never would.&quot; Scholars such as Robert Thurman and Huston Smith appraised it as the best book written on the subject.

Paine followed &quot;Re-enchantment&quot; with &quot;Adventures with the Buddha&quot; (2005), which elucidated Buddhism not through teachings or theology but by how it got lived out on a day-to-day basis by Western practitioners from the early Alexandra David-Néel and Lama Govinda to the contemporary Sharon Salzberg and Michael Roach. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it a work of &quot;genius, one that delights, informs, and fires the imagination.&quot;

Most recently Paine published—19 years in the making—&quot;Enlightenment Town: Finding Spiritual Awakening in a Most Implausible Place.&quot; That small town, Crestone, Colorado, has become something almost unthinkable: the home to 25 different religions, representing nearly all the brand-name faiths of the world. Seeing them all cohabiting together allows us to understand, and put in perspective, what seeing them one by one never could. Writing about &quot;Enlightenment Town,&quot; bestselling author Howard Norman called Jeffery Paine “our most creative journalist-scholar of religion.” Novelist Kate Wheeler added, “You won’t be able to resist…Jeffery Paine’s sly proposal that spiritual life can be both gentler and quite a bit wilder.”

Paine&#x27;s other works include the anthology he edited with Nobel Prize-winner Joseph Brodsky, &quot;The Poetry of Our World&quot; (2000), and in 2009 he was the writer of Huston Smith&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Tales of Wonder&quot;.

==Other writing, other media==
In addition to his books, Paine has written for most major national publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. He has been judge of the Pulitzer Prize and vice president of the National Book Critics Circle. He appears regularly on C-SPAN, NPR, and other radio and TV programs as well as speaking at the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, ICA (London), and universities around the country.

Besides print medium, Paine appears with Robert Thurman on the CD &quot;Thoughts on Buddhism&quot;. In 2009 he co-wrote the documentary about the 17th Karmapa, &quot;Bodhisattva&quot;, with Mark Elliott, and also appeared in the film &quot;Crazy Wisdom&quot;. He wrote the one-man show, &quot;Oh My God! The History of Religion in One Hour&quot;, which premiered in 2006 at the Smithsonian and which he subsequently performed at various venues on the East Coast.

Paine currently lives in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="548290" wikidata="Q3205415" url="?curid=548290" title="The Spell Sword">
<text>The Spell Sword is a sword and planet novel by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley, part of the &quot;Darkover&quot; series. The book was co-authored by Paul Edwin Zimmer, Bradley&#x27;s brother, though he was not credited. &quot;The Spell Sword&quot; was first published in paperback by DAW in 1974 and has been republished several times.

This book is the first in a trilogy within the Darkover series dealing with the evolution of Towers and Keepers. The sequels are &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot; (1979), which takes place many decades later. In &quot;Author&#x27;s Notes on Chronology&quot;, Bradley states that in her view, &quot;The Spell Sword&quot; occurs about thirty years before &quot;Star of Danger&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Andrew Carr is employed as a technician in the Empire&#x27;s Mapping and Exploration survey of Cottman IV, known locally as Darkover. His survey plane encounters a storm over the mountains and crashes. Carr survives through the intervention of a diaphanous figure that he initially believes to be a ghost. She tells him her name is Callista, a Keeper, and she is communicating with him through the Overworld. Carr believes none of this, but follows her directions to shelter.

Meanwhile, on the road to Armida, Damon Ridenow discusses recent violent conflicts with a native species called the cat-men with his guardsmen. Ridenow is a matrix technician who was recently dismissed by Leonie Hastur, Keeper of Arilinn, on the grounds that he is &quot;too sensitive&quot;.

During the journey, the group is attacked by an unseen entity. Only Damon Ridenow survives. He arrives at Armida to find that it, too, has been attacked, and Callista Lanart was kidnapped. Her twin, Ellemir Lanart, assures him Callista is alive because she can feel her sister&#x27;s telepathic presence, though they cannot communicate directly.

Damon ventures into the Overworld to seek Callista, but finds only a &quot;great darkness&quot; and a vaguely evil presence. Meanwhile, Andrew Carr arrives at the door seeking shelter and assistance. He mistakes Ellemir for Callista. After introductions and food, Andrew describes his experiences. Damon concludes Callista is being held by the cat-men.

Ellemir&#x27;s father, Esteban Lanart, Lord Alton, arrives with his guard. His party has also been attacked by an invisible enemy, and Lord Alton was gravely wounded. Damon uses his laran abilities to save one of the wounded guards, but can do nothing for Lord Alton, who is permanently paralyzed.

The next day, Lord Alton is informed of the situation, and Damon Ridenow tells him he wants to marry Ellemir. Alton approves Damon&#x27;s suit, but disapproves of Andrew Carr&#x27;s interest in Callista because she is a Keeper.

Damon says he will attempt to rescue Callista. Lord Alton suggests he use his Alton gift of forced rapport so that he can provide Damon with his own superior sword skills, which Damon lacks. After testing this theory and mounting a small matrix jewel in the hilt of his sword, Damon leaves for the darkening lands and the Caves of Corresanti. They engage the cat-men in several small skirmishes along the way.

At Armida, Andrew Carr has learned how to enter the Overworld, and locates Callista. Desperate to help her, he somehow manages to teleport himself into the caves. Andrew and Callista make their way through the caves with Damon and face off against the Great Cat, a larger cat with a powerful matrix jewel. The matrix is destroyed, and everyone returns to Armida.

Callista, the Keeper who is sworn to lifelong virginity, contemplates giving up her vows to be with Andrew.

==Major characters==
* Andrew Carr, Terranan
* Damon Ridenow, a matrix technician
* Callista Lanart, a matrix technician and keeper-nominate of Arilinn
* Ellemir Lanart, Callista&#x27;s twin

<doc id="548295" wikidata="Q5933770" url="?curid=548295" title="Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine is given each year to a periodical publication related to science fiction or fantasy that meets several criteria having to do with the number of issues published and who, if anyone, receives payment. The award was first presented in 1984, and has been given annually since, though the qualifying criteria have changed. Awards were once also given out for professional magazines in the professional magazine category, and are still awarded for fan magazines in the fanzine category.

In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, but for each of those years, the Semiprozine category failed to receive enough nominating votes to form a ballot.

At the 2008 business meeting, an amendment to the World Science Fiction Society&#x27;s Constitution was passed that would have removed the Semiprozine category. The vote to ratify this amendment was held the following year; the ratification failed and the category remained. Instead, a committee was formed to recommend improvements to the category and related categories.

==History of winners and nominees==
During the 41 nomination years, 40 magazines have been nominated. Of these, only 10 magazines run by 32 editors have won. &quot;Locus&quot; won 22 times and was nominated every year until a rules change in 2012 made it ineligible for the category. &quot;Uncanny Magazine&quot; has won 7 times out of 9 nominations, including 5 times in a row in 2016–2020, while &quot;Science Fiction Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Clarkesworld Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Lightspeed&quot; are the only other magazines to win more than once, with 2 awards out of 18 nominations, 3 out of 4, and 2 out of 5, respectively. &quot;Ansible&quot; has won 1 out of 7 nominations, &quot;Interzone&quot; has won 1 out of 28, &quot;FIYAH Magazine of Black Speculative Fiction&quot; has each won 1 out of 6 nominations, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; won 1 out of 4. As editor of &quot;Locus&quot; Charles N. Brown won 21 of 27 nominations, though he shared 5 of those awards with Kirsten Gong-Wong, 3 with Liza Groen Trombi and 2 with Jennifer A. Hall; as &quot;Locus&quot; editor Liza Groen Trombi won 1 shared with Kirsten Gong-Wong. &quot;Uncanny&quot;″s awards were primarily earned by a team of 5 people, Lynne M. Thomas, Michael Damian Thomas, Michi Trota, Erika Ensign, and Steven Schapansky. The sole editor for &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s awards was Andrew I. Porter, while David Pringle earned &quot;Interzone&quot;″s, and Ann VanderMeer and Stephen H. Segal were the editors for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″s victory. &quot;Lightspeed&quot;″s wins were under John Joseph Adams, Rich Horton, and Stefan Rudnicki, with Wendy N. Wagner and Christie Yant added for the second win, while David Langford was the editor when &quot;Ansible&quot; was awarded. &quot;Clarkesworld Magazine&quot;″s winning years were under Neil Clarke, Sean Wallace, and Kate Baker, with 2 of the three also under Cheryl Morgan and the other under Jason Heller. &quot;FIYAH&quot;″s win was under Troy L. Wiggins, DaVaun Sanders, Eboni Dunbar, Brandon O&#x27;Brien, Brent Lambert, and L. D. Lewis. &quot;Strange Horizons&quot;″s win was under &quot;The Strange Horizons Editorial Collective&quot;. &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot; has received the most number of nominations without ever winning at 22, under the helm of David G. Hartwell, Kathryn Cramer, Kevin J. Maroney, and 8 other editors.

==The Hugo Award nomination process==
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon). The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting among six nominees, or more in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the ones nominated by members that year, ranked according to a complex algorithm, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1953 through 1956 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1959 all six candidates were recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in the first months of each year, while voters vote on the ballot of six nominations in the middle of the year, with exact timing varying from year to year. Prior to 2017, the final ballot consisted of five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the &quot;year in literature&quot; article corresponding with when the work was eligible. Entries with a yellow background won the award for that year; those with a gray background are the other nominees on the short-list. Note that &quot;Thrust&quot; was renamed to &quot;Quantum&quot; and was nominated under both names; no other magazine has been nominated under multiple names.

<doc id="548297" wikidata="Q114106" url="?curid=548297" title="Metasearch engine">
<text>A metasearch engine (or [[search aggregator]]) is an online information retrieval tool that uses the data of a web search engine to produce its own results. Metasearch engines take input from a user and immediately query search engines for results. Sufficient data is gathered, ranked, and presented to the users.

Problems such as spamming reduce the accuracy and precision of results. The process of fusion aims to improve the engineering of a metasearch engine.

Examples of metasearch engines include Skyscanner and Kayak.com, which aggregate search results of online travel agencies and provider websites. SearXNG is a generic free and open-source search software which aggregates results from internet search engines and other sources like Wikipedia and is offered for free by more than 70 SearxNG providers.

== History ==
The first person to incorporate the idea of meta searching was University of Washington student Eric Selberg, who published a paper about his MetaCrawler experiment in 1995. The search engine is still usable as of 2024. 

On May 20, 1996, HotBot, then owned by Wired, was a search engine with search results coming from the Inktomi and Direct Hit databases. It was known for its fast results and as a search engine with the ability to search within search results. Upon being bought by Lycos in 1998, development for the search engine staggered and its market share fell drastically. After going through a few alterations, HotBot was redesigned into a simplified search interface, with its features being incorporated into Lycos&#x27; website redesign.

In 1997, Daniel Dreilinger published a paper on his experimental metasearch engine, SavvySearch, which was able to automatically select the correct search engine to prioritize based on prior experience.

A metasearch engine called Anvish was developed by Bo Shu and Subhash Kak in 1999; the search results were sorted using instantaneously trained neural networks. This was later incorporated into another metasearch engine called Solosearch.

In August 2000, India got its first meta search engine when HumHaiIndia.com was launched. It was developed by the then 16 year old Sumeet Lamba. The website was later rebranded as Tazaa.com.

Ixquick is a search engine known for its privacy policy statement. Developed and launched in 1998 by David Bodnick, it is owned by Surfboard Holding BV. In June 2006, Ixquick began to delete private details of its users following the same process with Scroogle. Ixquick&#x27;s privacy policy includes no recording of users&#x27; IP addresses, no identifying cookies, no collection of personal data, and no sharing of personal data with third parties. It also uses a unique ranking system where a result is ranked by stars. The more stars in a result, the more search engines agreed on the result.

In April 2005, Dogpile, then owned and operated by InfoSpace, Inc., collaborated with researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University to measure the overlap and ranking differences of leading Web search engines in order to gauge the benefits of using a metasearch engine to search the web. Results found that from 10,316 random user-defined queries from Google, Yahoo!, and Ask Jeeves, only 3.2% of first page search results were the same across those search engines for a given query. Another study later that year using 12,570 random user-defined queries from Google, Yahoo!, MSN Search, and Ask Jeeves found that only 1.1% of first page search results were the same across those search engines for a given query.

== Advantages ==
By sending multiple queries to several other search engines this extends the coverage data of the topic and allows more information to be found. They use the indexes built by other search engines, aggregating and often post-processing results in unique ways. A metasearch engine has an advantage over a single search engine because more results can be retrieved with the same amount of exertion. It also reduces the work of users from having to individually type in searches from different engines to look for resources.

Metasearching is also a useful approach if the purpose of the user&#x27;s search is to get an overview of the topic or to get quick answers. Instead of having to go through multiple search engines like Yahoo! or Google and comparing results, metasearch engines are able to quickly compile and combine results. They can do it either by listing results from each engine queried with no additional post-processing (Dogpile) or by analyzing the results and ranking them by their own rules (IxQuick, Metacrawler, and Vivismo).

A metasearch engine can also hide the searcher&#x27;s IP address from the search engines queried thus providing privacy to the search.

== Disadvantages ==
Metasearch engines are not capable of parsing query forms or able to fully translate query syntax. The number of hyperlinks generated by metasearch engines are limited, and therefore do not provide the user with the complete results of a query.

The majority of metasearch engines do not provide over ten linked files from a single search engine, and generally do not interact with larger search engines for results. Pay per click links are prioritised and are normally displayed first.

Metasearching also gives the illusion that there is more coverage of the topic queried, particularly if the user is searching for popular or commonplace information. It&#x27;s common to end with multiple identical results from the queried engines. It is also harder for users to search with advanced search syntax to be sent with the query, so results may not be as precise as when a user is using an advanced search interface at a specific engine. This results in many metasearch engines using simple searching.

== Operation ==
A metasearch engine accepts a single search request from the user. This search request is then passed on to another search engine&#x27;s database. A metasearch engine does not create a database of web pages but generates a Federated database system of data integration from multiple sources.

Since every search engine is unique and has different algorithms for generating ranked data, duplicates will therefore also be generated. To remove duplicates, a metasearch engine processes this data and applies its own algorithm. A revised list is produced as an output for the user. When a metasearch engine contacts other search engines, these search engines will respond in three ways:

* They will both cooperate and provide complete access to the interface for the metasearch engine, including private access to the index database, and will inform the metasearch engine of any changes made upon the index database;
* Search engines can behave in a non-cooperative manner whereby they will not deny or provide any access to interfaces; 
* The search engine can be completely hostile and refuse the metasearch engine total access to their database and in serious circumstances, by seeking legal methods.

=== Architecture of ranking ===
Web pages that are highly ranked on many search engines are likely to be more relevant in providing useful information. However, all search engines have different ranking scores for each website and most of the time these scores are not the same. This is because search engines prioritise different criteria and methods for scoring, hence a website might appear highly ranked on one search engine and lowly ranked on another. This is a problem because Metasearch engines rely heavily on the consistency of this data to generate reliable accounts.

=== Fusion ===
A metasearch engine uses the process of Fusion to filter data for more efficient results. The two main fusion methods used are: Collection Fusion and Data Fusion.

* Collection Fusion: also known as distributed retrieval, deals specifically with search engines that index unrelated data. To determine how valuable these sources are, Collection Fusion looks at the content and then ranks the data on how likely it is to provide relevant information in relation to the query. From what is generated, Collection Fusion is able to pick out the best resources from the rank. These chosen resources are then merged into a list.
* Data Fusion: deals with information retrieved from search engines that indexes common data sets. The process is very similar. The initial rank scores of data are merged into a single list, after which the original ranks of each of these documents are analysed. Data with high scores indicate a high level of relevancy to a particular query and are therefore selected. To produce a list, the scores must be normalized using algorithms such as CombSum. This is because search engines adopt different policies of algorithms resulting in the score produced being incomparable.

== Spamdexing ==
Spamdexing is the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes. It uses a number of methods to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed in a manner unaligned with the intention of the indexing system. Spamdexing can be very distressing for users and problematic for search engines because the return contents of searches have poor precision. This will eventually result in the search engine becoming unreliable and not dependable for the user. To tackle Spamdexing, search robot algorithms are made more complex and are changed almost every day to eliminate the problem.

It is a major problem for metasearch engines because it tampers with the Web crawler&#x27;s indexing criteria, which are heavily relied upon to format ranking lists. Spamdexing manipulates the natural ranking system of a search engine, and places websites higher on the ranking list than they would naturally be placed. There are three primary methods used to achieve this:

=== Content spam ===
Content spam are the techniques that alter the logical view that a search engine has over the page&#x27;s contents. Techniques include:
* Keyword Stuffing – Calculated placements of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety, and density of the page
* Hidden/Invisible Text – Unrelated text disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within the HTML code 
* Meta-tag Stuffing – Repeating keywords in meta tags and/or using keywords unrelated to the site&#x27;s content
* Doorway Pages – Low quality webpages with little content, but relatable keywords or phrases
* Scraper Sites – Programs that allow websites to copy content from other websites and create content for a website
* Article Spinning – Rewriting existing articles as opposed to copying content from other sites
* Machine Translation – Uses machine translation to rewrite content in several different languages, resulting in illegible text

=== Link spam ===
Link spam are links between pages present for reasons other than merit. Techniques include:
* Link-building Software – Automating the search engine optimization (SEO) process
* Link Farms – Pages that reference each other (also known as mutual admiration societies)
* Hidden Links – Placing hyperlinks where visitors won&#x27;t or can&#x27;t see them
* Sybil Attack – Forging of multiple identities for malicious intent
* Spam Blogs – Blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites
* Page Hijacking – Creating a copy of a popular website with similar content, but redirects web surfers to unrelated or even malicious websites
* Buying Expired Domains – Buying expiring domains and replacing pages with links to unrelated websites
* Cookie Stuffing – Placing an affiliate tracking cookie on a website visitor&#x27;s computer without their knowledge
* Forum Spam – Websites that can be edited by users to insert links to spam sites

=== Cloaking ===
This is an SEO technique in which different materials and information are sent to the web crawler and to the web browser. It is commonly used as a spamdexing technique because it can trick search engines into either visiting a site that is substantially different from the search engine description or giving a certain site a higher ranking.

<doc id="548300" wikidata="Q7786456" url="?curid=548300" title="This Is Your Day">
<text>This is Your Day is a Christian television show hosted by Pastor Benny Hinn and has been broadcast several times a week in the United States and globally by the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), INSP Networks, The God Channel and various local affiliates to an estimated four million followers. The program began airing in 1990 and is a half-hour long. However, TBN would cease airing the show in 2016. Daystar would also drop it in 2017.

==Synopsis==
During the program, Benny Hinn and his guests teach, read letters, pray, and show highlights from Hinn&#x27;s &quot;Miracle Healing Services.&quot; Hinn and his crew travel the world frequently, and a large part of the show is devoted to his global services, in which Hinn is said to imbue people with the power of the Holy Spirit. Many claim to have risen from wheelchairs, or to have been healed of other ailments. Towards the final portion of the program Hinn offers gifts such as books, CDs, DVDs and downloadable materials as a thank-you to viewers who donate to the ministry. He then prays for the prayer needs of his viewing audience. Finally he concludes with an invitation for viewers to receive Jesus as their personal savior.

==Controversy==
The program has generated controversy due to widespread skepticism about Hinn&#x27;s faith healings depicted in the show. Investigative news programs such as &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, and &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; claim that Hinn uses the power of suggestion to make crusade attendees fall on stage and believe they&#x27;re cured.

<doc id="548303" wikidata="Q459700" url="?curid=548303" title="Ambrosius of Georgia">
<text>St. Ambrosius (, &quot;Ambrosi&quot;) (September 7, 1861 – March 29, 1927) was a Georgian religious figure and scholar who served as the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia from 1921 to 1927. Best known for his opposition to the Soviet regime, he was canonized in 1995 by the Georgian Orthodox Church as Saint Ambrosius the Confessor (ამბროსი აღმსარებელი, &quot;Ambrosi Aghmsarebeli&quot;).

== Early life and career ==

Ambrosius was born as Besarion Khelaia (ბესარიონ ხელაია) in Martvili, Georgia, then part of Imperial Russia. He graduated from the Tiflis Theological Seminary in 1885 and was ordained to the priesthood in Abkhazia where he served as a priest in Sukhumi, New Athos, and Lykhny, and also delivered courses in the Georgian language. Under the pseudonym of Amber, he published a series of articles denouncing the policy of Russification in Abkhazia and accusing local Russian officials of fomenting anti-Georgian sentiments among the Abkhaz people. In 1896, he enrolled into the Kazan Theological Academy, from which he graduated in 1900, having authored a thesis, “the Struggle of Christianity against Islam in Georgia.” Tonsured a Hieromonk in 1901, he returned in Georgia where he was made an archimandrite at the Chelishi Monastery in the province of Racha. In 1904, he was transferred to the Synodal Office in Tbilisi, and became an archimandrite of the Monastery of the Transfiguration.

== Autocephalist movement ==

In the 1900s, during the heated debates concerning the status of the Georgian church, he emerged as one of the leaders of the Georgian autocephalist movement, calling for the restoration of the autocephalous (independent) Orthodox Church of Georgia abolished by Imperial Russia in 1811. Waged for the most part in the press and church committees, the struggle peaked during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and occasionally evolved into violent clashes. The Georgian bishops pointed out that under the Russian exarches sent down from St. Petersburg to run Georgia&#x27;s ecclesiastic affairs, the Georgian church lost some 140 million rubles’ worth of property and estates; church schools had been closed down, and the use of Georgian in the liturgy discouraged; twenty episcopal sees lay vacant and seven hundred and forty parishes were without pastors. The Georgians sent an appeal to the tsar, but nothing came of this. Autocephaly was denied. The conference of Georgian clergy which met at Tbilisi in 1905 was dispersed by police and several &quot;autocephalists&quot; were arrested. Ambrosius was banned from celebrating the liturgy and confined in the Troitsky Monastery at Ryazan.

The struggle culminated in 1908, when the Russian Exarch of Georgia, Archbishop Nikon, was murdered on 28 May at his residence in Tbilisi by unidentified assassins, allegedly by a Georgian nationalist. No one was ever tried or convicted for the murder, and although the links of the Georgian autocephalists to the crime remained unclear, the initial police investigation concluded they had been behind the murder of Nikon, and the Russian authorities used the situation as a pretext for removing Georgian bishops from their posts. Ambrosius was also suspended from serving and deported to Russia. He was acquitted in 1910, but it was not until the 1917 events when he was allowed to return to Georgia. Although the Georgian autocephalist movement earned worldwide sympathies, the dispute dragged on indecisively for years, until the outbreak of World War I relegated it temporarily to the background. 

The 1917 February Revolution in the Russian Empire and the ensuing turmoil in both church and state gave an opportunity to the Georgian Church to reassert its autocephalous status. On March 12, 1917, a group of Georgian clergymen proclaimed the autocephaly of their Church and elected Bishop Kyrion as Catholicos Patriarch. The Most Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church refused to recognize the move, and the result was a break in communion between the two Churches. Ambrosius was soon consecrated Metropolitan of Chkondidi, western Georgia, and then transferred to Abkhazia.

== Catholicos Patriarch of All Georgia ==

The Soviet invasion of Georgia from February to March 1921 brought a short-lived independent Democratic Republic of Georgia to an end. Soon the Catholicos Patriarch Leonid died of cholera, and, on October 14, 1921, Ambrosius was elected as his successor.

Under the newly established Bolshevik regime, the Church was deprived of juridical status, and churches and monasteries began to be closed. The clergy was persecuted and the property of the churches and monasteries confiscated.

On February 7, 1922, Ambrosius addressed a memorandum to the Genoa Conference, in which he described the conditions under which Georgia was living since the Red Army invasion, protested in the name of the people of Georgia, deprived of their rights, against the Soviet occupation and demanded the intervention of civilized humanity to oppose the atrocities of the Bolshevik regime. In February 1923, Ambrosius and all members of the Patriarchal Council were arrested and put into prison by the Bolsheviks. In March 1924, the Soviet authorities staged a humiliating public trial. Besides sending an appeal to the Genoa Conference, Ambrosi was also accused of concealing of the historic treasures of the Church in order to preserve them from passing into the hands of the Soviet state. All the clerics arrested along with the Patriarch, showed their solidarity with Ambrosius, who assumed the entire responsibility for his acts, which he declared to have been in conformity with his obligations and with the tradition of the Church of Georgia. His concluding words were: &quot;My soul belongs to God, my heart to my country; you, my executioners, do what you will with my body.&quot; Ambrosi was expected to be sentenced to death, but the Communists did not dare to execute him and condemned him to eight years imprisonment while his property was confiscated.

Shortly afterwards, the 1924 August Uprising broke out in several regions of Georgia against the Soviet Union and lasted for three weeks. Approximately 3,000 died in fighting, more than 12,000 were executed and 20,000 deported to Siberia. A number of clerics were also purged, Archbishop Nazari of Kutatisi and Gaenati being among those who were shot without a trial.

The extent of the Red Terror in Georgia and a public outcry caused by it forced the Soviets to relatively moderate their pressure on Georgia&#x27;s society in the following years. In early March 1925 the Chairman of the All-Union Executive Committee, Mikhail Kalinin, visited Georgia and called for the amnesty of the participants of the August 1924 insurrection, and for the suspension of religious persecutions. In 1926, Ambrosi and several other clerics were released from prisons. He did not live much longer, however, and died on March 29, 1927, in Tbilisi.

Ambrosius is also a known as a prolific historian of church and researcher of primary Georgian sources. He authored a number of articles published in Russian and Georgian press, and discovered a hitherto unknown version of the medieval Georgian chronicle, &quot;Moktsevay Kartlisay&quot; (“The Conversion of Georgia”) (the so-called Chelishi codex).

==Canonization==
In 1995, the Holy Synod of the Georgian Orthodox Church canonized Ambrosius as the Holy Archpriest Ambrosius the Confessor and set March 16 (29, N.S.) as the day of his commemoration. In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.

<text>A gas-filled tube, also commonly known as a discharge tube or formerly as a [[Julius Plücker|Plücker]] tube, is an arrangement of electrodes in a gas within an insulating, temperature-resistant envelope. Gas-filled tubes exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, and operate by ionizing the gas with an applied voltage sufficient to cause electrical conduction by the underlying phenomena of the Townsend discharge. A gas-discharge lamp is an electric light using a gas-filled tube; these include fluorescent lamps, metal-halide lamps, sodium-vapor lamps, and neon lights. Specialized gas-filled tubes such as krytrons, thyratrons, and ignitrons are used as switching devices in electric devices.

The voltage required to initiate and sustain discharge is dependent on the pressure and composition of the fill gas and geometry of the tube. Although the envelope is typically glass, power tubes often use ceramics, and military tubes often use glass-lined metal. Both hot cathode and cold cathode type devices are encountered.

==Gases in use==

===Hydrogen===
Hydrogen is used in tubes used for very fast switching, e.g. some thyratrons, dekatrons, and krytrons, where very steep edges are required. The build-up and recovery times of hydrogen are much shorter than in other gases. Hydrogen thyratrons are usually hot-cathode. Hydrogen (and deuterium) can be stored in the tube in the form of a metal hydride, heated with an auxiliary filament; hydrogen by heating such storage element can be used to replenish cleaned-up gas, and even to adjust the pressure as needed for a thyratron operation at a given voltage.

===Deuterium===
Deuterium is used in ultraviolet lamps for ultraviolet spectroscopy, in neutron generator tubes, and in special tubes (e.g. crossatron). It has higher breakdown voltage than hydrogen. In fast switching tubes it is used instead of hydrogen where high voltage operation is required. For a comparison, the hydrogen-filled CX1140 thyratron has anode voltage rating of 25 kV, while the deuterium-filled and otherwise identical CX1159 has 33 kV. Also, at the same voltage the pressure of deuterium can be higher than of hydrogen, allowing higher rise rates of current before it causes excessive anode dissipation. Significantly higher peak powers are achievable. Its recovery time is however about 40% slower than for hydrogen.

===Noble gases===
Noble gases are frequently used in tubes for many purposes, from lighting to switching. Pure noble gases are employed in switching tubes. Noble-gas-filled thyratrons have better electrical parameters than mercury-based ones. The electrodes undergo damage by high-velocity ions. The neutral atoms of the gas slow the ions down by collisions, and reduce the energy transferred to the electrodes by the ion impact. Gases with high atomic weight, e.g. xenon, protect the electrodes better than lighter ones, e.g. neon.
*Helium is used in helium–neon lasers and in some thyratrons rated for high currents and high voltages. Helium provides about as short deionization time as hydrogen, but can withstand lower voltage, so it is used much less often.
*Neon has low ignition voltage and is frequently used in low-voltage tubes. Discharge in neon emits relatively bright red light; neon-filled switching tubes therefore also act as indicators, shining red when switched on. This is exploited in the decatron tubes, which act as both counters and displays. Its red light is exploited in neon signage. Used in fluorescent tubes with high power and short length, e.g. industrial lighting tubes. Has higher voltage drop in comparison with argon and krypton. Its low atomic mass provides only a little protection to the electrodes against accelerated ions; additional screening wires or plates can be used for prolonging the anode lifetime. In fluorescent tubes it is used in combination with mercury.
*Argon was the first gas used in fluorescent tubes and is still frequently used due to its low cost, high efficiency, and very low striking voltage. In fluorescent tubes it is used in combination with mercury. It was also used in early rectifier tubes; first thyratrons were derived from such argon-filled tubes.
*Krypton can be used in fluorescent lamps instead of argon; in that application it reduces the total energy losses on electrodes from about 15% to 7%. The voltage drop per lamp length is however lower than with argon, which can be compensated by smaller tube diameter. Krypton-filled lamps also require higher starting voltage; this can be alleviated by using e.g. 25%–75% argon-krypton mixture. In fluorescent tubes it is used in combination with mercury.
*Xenon in pure state has high breakdown voltage, making it useful in higher-voltage switching tubes. Xenon is also used as a component of gas mixtures when production of ultraviolet radiation is required, e.g. in plasma displays, usually to excite a phosphor. The wavelength produced is longer than with argon and krypton and penetrates the phosphors better. To lower the ionization voltage, neon-xenon or helium-xenon are used; above , helium has lower breakdown voltage than neon and vice versa. At concentrations of 1% and less of xenon, the Penning effect becomes significant in such mixtures, as most of xenon ionization occurs by collision with excited atoms of the other noble gas; at more than few percents of xenon, the discharge ionizes xenon directly due to most energy of the electrons being spent on direct ionization of xenon.
*Penning mixtures are used where lower ionization voltage is required, e.g. in the neon lamps, Geiger–Müller tubes and other gas-filled particle detectors. A classical combination is about 98–99.5% of neon with 0.5–2% of argon, used in, e.g. neon bulbs and in monochrome plasma displays.

===Elemental vapors (metals and nonmetals)===
*Mercury vapors are used for applications with high current, e.g. lights, mercury-arc valves, ignitrons. Mercury is used because of its high vapor pressure and low ionization potential. Mercury mixed with an inert gas is used where the energy losses in the tube have to be low and the tube lifetime should be long. In mercury-inert gas mixtures, the discharge is initially carried primarily by the inert gas; the released heat then serves to evaporate enough mercury to reach the desired vapor pressure. Low-voltage (hundreds volts) rectifiers use saturated mercury vapor in combination with a small amount of inert gas, allowing cold start of the tubes. High-voltage (kilovolts and more) rectifiers use pure mercury vapor at low pressure, requiring maintenance of maximum temperature of the tube. The liquid mercury serves as a reservoir of mercury, replenishing the vapors that are used up during the discharge. Unsaturated mercury vapor can be used, but as it can not be replenished, the lifetime of such tubes is lower. The strong dependence of vapor pressure on mercury temperature limits the environments the mercury-based tubes can operate in. In low-pressure mercury lamps, there is an optimum mercury pressure for the highest efficiency. Photons emitted by ionized mercury atoms can be absorbed by nearby nonionized atoms and either reradiated or the atom is deexcited nonradiatively, too high mercury pressure therefore causes losses of light. Too low mercury pressure leads to too few atoms present to get ionized and radiate photons. The optimum temperature for low-pressure mercury lamps is at about 42 °C, when the saturated vapor pressure of mercury (present as a drop of about 1 mg of liquid mercury in the tube, as a reservoir compensating for losses by clean-up) reaches this optimum. In lamps intended for operation at higher ambient temperatures, and at a wider temperature range, mercury is present in the form of an amalgam with e.g. bismuth and indium; the vapor pressure above amalgam is lower than above liquid mercury. Mercury is used in fluorescent tubes as a source of visible and ultraviolet light for exciting the phosphor; in that application it is usually used together with argon, or in some cases with krypton or neon. Mercury ions deionize slowly, limiting the switching speed of mercury-filled thyratrons. Ion bombardment with mercury ions of even relatively low energies also gradually destroys oxide-coated cathodes.
*Sodium vapors are used in sodium-vapor lamps.
*Sulfur vapors are used in sulfur lamps.
*Vapors of many metals, alone or together with a noble gas, are used in many lasers.

===Other gases===

*Air can be used in some low-demanding applications.
*Nitrogen at relatively high pressure tends to be used in surge arresters, due to its short build-up time, giving the tubes fast response time to voltage surges.
*Halogens and alcohol vapors absorb ultraviolet radiation and have high electron affinity. When added to inert gases, they quench the discharge; this is exploited in e.g. Geiger–Müller tubes.

===Insulating gases===

In special cases (e.g., high-voltage switches), gases with good dielectric properties and very high breakdown voltages are needed. Highly electronegative elements, e.g., halogens, are favored as they rapidly recombine with the ions present in the discharge channel. One of the most popular choices is sulfur hexafluoride, used in special high-voltage applications. Other common options are dry pressurized nitrogen and halocarbons.

==Gas-tube physics and technology==
The fundamental mechanism is the Townsend discharge, which is the sustained multiplication of electron flow by ion impact when a critical value of electric field strength for the density of the gas is reached. As the electric field is increased various phases of discharge are encountered as shown in the accompanying plot. The gas used dramatically influences the parameters of the tube. The breakdown voltage depends on the gas composition and electrode distance; the dependencies are described by Paschen&#x27;s law.

===Gas pressure===
The gas pressure may range between ; most commonly, pressures between 1–10 torr are used. The gas pressure influences the following factors:
*breakdown voltage (also called ignition voltage)
*current density
*operating voltage
*backfire voltage
*tube lifetime (lower pressure tubes tend to have shorter lifetimes due to using up of the gas)
*cathode sputtering, reduced at higher pressures

Above a certain value, the higher the gas pressure, the higher the ignition voltage. High-pressure lighting tubes can require a few kilovolts impulse for ignition when cold, when the gas pressure is low. After warming up, when the volatile compound used for light emission is vaporized and the pressure increases, reignition of the discharge requires either significantly higher voltage or reducing the internal pressure by cooling down the lamp. For example, many sodium vapor lamps cannot be re-lit immediately after being shut off; they must cool down before they can be lit up again.

The gas tends to be used up during the tube operation, by several phenomena collectively called clean-up. The gas atoms or molecules are adsorbed on the surfaces of the electrodes. In high voltage tubes, the accelerated ions can penetrate into the electrode materials. New surfaces, formed by sputtering of the electrodes and deposited on e.g. the inner surfaces of the tube, also readily adsorb gases. Non-inert gases can also chemically react with the tube components. Hydrogen may diffuse through some metals.

For removal of gas in vacuum tubes, getters are used. For resupplying gas for gas-filled tubes, replenishers are employed. Most commonly, replenishers are used with hydrogen; a filament made from a hydrogen-absorbing metal (e.g. zirconium or titanium) is present in the tube, and by controlling its temperature the ratio of absorbed and desorbed hydrogen is adjusted, resulting in controlling of the hydrogen pressure in the tube. The metal filament acts as a hydrogen storage. This approach is used in e.g. hydrogen thyratrons or neutron tubes. Usage of saturated mercury vapor allows using a pool of liquid mercury as a large storage of material; the atoms lost by clean-up are automatically replenished by evaporation of more mercury. The pressure in the tube is however strongly dependent on the mercury temperature, which has to be controlled carefully.

Large rectifiers use saturated mercury vapor with a small amount of an inert gas. The inert gas supports the discharge when the tube is cold.

The mercury arc valve current-voltage characteristics are highly dependent on the temperature of the liquid mercury. The voltage drop in forward bias decreases from about 60 volts at 0 °C to somewhat above 10 volts at 50 °C and then stays constant; the reverse bias breakdown (&quot;arc-back&quot;) voltage drops dramatically with temperature, from 36 kV at 60 °C to 12 kV at 80 °C to even less at higher temperatures. The operating range is therefore usually between 18–65 °C.

===Gas purity===
The gas in the tube has to be kept pure to maintain the desired properties; even small amount of impurities can dramatically change the tube values. The presence of non-inert gases generally increases the breakdown and burning voltages. The presence of impurities can be observed by changes in the glow color of the gas. Air leaking into the tube introduces oxygen, which is highly electronegative and inhibits the production of electron avalanches. This makes the discharge look pale, milky, or reddish. Traces of mercury vapors glow bluish, obscuring the original gas color. Magnesium vapor colors the discharge green. To prevent outgassing of the tube components during operation, a bake-out is required before filling with gas and sealing. Thorough degassing is required for high-quality tubes; even as little as 10−8 torr (≈1 μPa) of oxygen is sufficient for covering the electrodes with monomolecular oxide layer in few hours. Non-inert gases can be removed by suitable getters. For mercury-containing tubes, getters that do not form amalgams with mercury (e.g. zirconium, but not barium) have to be used. Cathode sputtering may be used intentionally for gettering non-inert gases; some reference tubes use molybdenum cathodes for this purpose.

Pure inert gases are used where the difference between the ignition voltage and the burning voltage has to be high, e.g. in switching tubes. Tubes for indication and stabilization, where the difference has to be lower, tend to be filled with Penning mixtures; the lower difference between ignition and burning voltages allows using lower power supply voltages and smaller series resistances.

==Lighting and display gas-filled tubes==
Fluorescent lighting, CFL lamps, mercury and sodium discharge lamps and HID lamps are all gas-filled tubes used for lighting.

Neon lamps and neon signage (most of which is not neon based these days) are also low-pressure gas-filled tubes.

Specialized historic low-pressure gas-filled tube devices include the Nixie tube (used to display numerals) and the Decatron (used to count or divide pulses, with display as a secondary function).

Xenon flash lamps are gas-filled tubes used in cameras and strobe lights to produce bright flashes of light.

The recently developed sulfur lamps are also gas-filled tubes when hot.

==Gas-filled tubes in electronics==
Since the ignition voltage depends on the ion concentration which may drop to zero after a long period of inactivity, many tubes are primed for ion availability:
* optically, by ambient light or by a 2-watt incandescent lamp, or by a glow discharge in the same envelope, 
* radioactively, by adding tritium to the gas, or by coating the envelope inside,
* electrically, with a &quot;keep-alive&quot; or &quot;primer&quot; electrode

===Power devices===
Some important examples include the thyratron, krytron, and ignitron tubes, which are used to switch high-voltage currents. A specialized type of gas-filled tube called a Gas Discharge Tube (GDT) is fabricated for use as surge protectors, to limit voltage surges in electrical and electronic circuits.

===Computing tubes===
The Schmitt trigger effect of the negative differential resistance-region can be exploited to realize timers, relaxation oscillators and digital circuits with neon lamps, &quot;trigger tubes&quot;, &quot;relay tubes&quot;, dekatrons and nixie tubes.

Thyratrons can also be used as triodes by operating them below their ignition voltage, allowing them to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in radio control receivers.

===Indicators===
There were special neon lamps besides nixie tubes:
*&quot;Tuneon&quot; early tuning indicator, a glass tube with a short wire anode and a long wire cathode that glows partially; the glow length is proportional to the tube current
*Phosphored neon lamp
*Luminescent trigger tube, used as latching indicators, or pixels of dot-matrix displays
**Direct-glow trigger tube
**Phosphored trigger tube

===Noise diodes===
Hot-cathode, gas-discharge noise diodes were available in normal radio tube glass envelopes for frequencies up to UHF, and as long, thin glass tubes with a normal bayonet light bulb mount for the filament and an anode top cap, for SHF frequencies and diagonal insertion into a waveguide.

They were filled with a pure inert gas such as neon because mixtures made the output temperature-dependent. Their burning voltage was under 200 V, but they needed optical priming by an incandescent 2-watt lamp and a voltage surge in the 5-kV range for ignition.

One miniature thyratron found an additional use as a noise source, when operated as a diode in a transverse magnetic field.

===Voltage-regulator tubes===
In the mid-20th century, voltage-regulator tubes were commonly used.

===Elapsed-time measurement===
Cathode sputtering is taken advantage of in the &quot;Time Totalizer&quot;, a metal-vapor coulometer-based elapsed time meter where the sputtered metal is deposited on a collector element whose resistance therefore decreases slowly.

<doc id="548309" wikidata="Q7908495" url="?curid=548309" title="Vaginal Davis">
<text>Vaginal Davis (born in Los Angeles, California) is an American performing artist, painter, independent curator, composer, filmmaker and writer. Born intersex and raised in South Central, Los Angeles, Davis gained notoriety in New York during the 1980s, where she inspired the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn&#x27;s prevalent drag scene as a genderqueer artist. She currently resides in Berlin, Germany.

==Early life==
Growing up, Davis lived with her mother, originally from Louisiana, and four older sisters. Her mother was Black Creole, her father was of Mexican and Jewish descent, and her grandfather was of German descent, with Davis stating that he was born in Wannsee and was the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the von Hohenzollern dynasty. Davis&#x27; mother was a revolutionary feminist and community activist in the South Central area, and planted food gardens in vacant lots to help feed the homeless, impoverished, and marginalized peoples of the area. As a young child in the Los Angeles public education system, Davis was accepted into a program for gifted students, where she was first exposed to and developed a love of theater and opera. At age 7, Davis saw Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; on a school trip to the opera, and credits this experience as a catalyst for her development as a drag queen.

== Career ==
Davis&#x27; name pays homage to activist Angela Davis, and considers Davis&#x27; involvement with the Black Panther Party and activism as a whole to be one of her biggest inspirations, explaining, &quot;They came into the schools, they had guns, and they took over. They were teaching us all these revolutionary songs and chants and what not. At that time, when Angela Davis was the most wanted woman in America, I was just fixated with that image of her. By the late &#x27;70s I had decided I sort of wanted to sexualize her name and become her, more or less. So I started in the late &#x27;70s calling myself Vaginal Davis. I started to perform– or tried to perform– at these gay clubs in Los Angeles, in Hollywood. The people in these clubs, they would look at me and say, &#x27;Vaginal Davis? Well who are you supposed to be?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well, Angela Davis– it&#x27;s a homage to that.&#x27; And they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Well who&#x27;s that?&#x27; They didn&#x27;t know who Angela Davis was.&quot;

Vaginal Davis is one of the founders of the homo-core punk movement. She chooses to exploit herself to engage in rude provocations and &quot;gender-fucking.&quot; As a self-labeled &quot;sexual repulsive&quot;, she is an icon of the disruptive performance aesthetic known as terrorist drag.

===1970–1989: Career beginnings===
Vaginal Davis&#x27; band the Afro Sisters released their first seven-inch EP &quot;Indigo, Sassafras &amp; Molasses&quot;, produced by Geza X with Amoeba Records in 1978. The Afro Sisters opened for the Smiths on their first American tour, as well as the Happy Mondays.

Vaginal Davis is often associated with the formation of the Queercore zine movement. From 1982 to 1991, she self-published the zine &quot;Fertile La Toyah Jackson,&quot; focused on the imaginary adventures of a skateboarding, pregnant Jackson, and hailed by &quot;The Advocate&quot; critic Adam Block as &quot;A veritable John Waters film of a skinny &#x27;zine.&quot; Bruce LaBruce described the zine as &quot;an underground rag that featured SoCal punk scene gossip, photos of hot Huntington Beach surfers and wistful musings by Miss Davis themself.&quot; Through Davis&#x27; job at UCLA&#x27;s Placement &amp; Career Planning Center, she was allowed free access to a Xerox machine to publish the zine. Davis went on to develop the zine into a series of videos titled Fertile LaToyah Jackson Video Magazine, Volume 1 and 2.

===1989–1999: Bands===
Davis was well known for her band ¡Cholita! The Female Menudo, where she assumed the persona of a -year-old Latina named Graciela. Band mates included longtime collaborator Alice Bag as Sad Girl and Fertile LaToyah Jackson as Guadalupe, ages 16 and respectively.

In 1989, Davis formed the speed metal thrash band Pedro, Muriel, and Esther (PME) with Glen Meadmore. In PME, Davis performs as Clarence, &quot;a white-supremacist militia-man from Idaho complete with ZZ Top beard.&quot; Davis had previously sung backup vocals for Meadmore, with RuPaul. PME disbanded after releasing a four-song EP on Amoeba records.

Davis formed the band Black Fag in 1992 with Bibbe Hansen. Through the persona Rayvn Cymone McFarlane, Davis parodied the LA alternative scene, while engaging in performative actions such as spraying the audience with milk from her bra. Black Fag&#x27;s album &quot;Passover Satyr&quot; was released by Dischord Records that same year and was produced by Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon. The band&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;11 Harrow House&quot; was produced by Hansen&#x27;s son Beck.

In 1995, Pedro, Muriel, and Esther reunited for a performance at the Queercore &#x27;95 festival in Chicago. The band later released their first full-length album &quot;The White to Be Angry&quot;, produced by Steve Albini in 1998 on Spectra Sonic Records.

===2000–2009: Move to Germany===
In Los Angeles, Davis has hosted and DJ&#x27;d a range of performance and music events, one of the most prominent being &quot;Bricktops&quot; (2002–2005), a weekly salon/speak-easy inspired by vaudevillian Ada &quot;Bricktop&quot; Smith. they also hosted and DJed a Sunday afternoon music event called &quot;Sucker&quot; (1994–2000). Davis and artist Ron Athey curated and hosted GIMP (2000–2001), a monthly night of performance art.

In 2006, Vaginal Davis moved from Los Angeles to Berlin, Germany.

In 2009, Pedro, Muriel and Esther reunited in a 20th-anniversary show presented in New York City by Participant Inc. as part of Performa 09.

===2010–present: Performance, visual art, and teaching===
Davis&#x27; performance piece &quot;Speaking from the Diaphragm&quot; ran from May 15 to 27, 2010, at Performance Space 122. The show parodied television talk shows and featured interviews by Carole Pope, Jamie Stewart, Joel Gibb, and Glen Meadmore and was co-hosted by Carmelita Tropicana and Jennifer Miller.

In January 2012 Davis participated in the J. Paul Getty&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Standard Time Performance Festival, with &quot;My Pussy Is Still in Los Angeles (I Only Live in Berlin)&quot; at Southwestern Law School, Louis XVI-style Tea Room (originally Bullocks Wilshire Department Store). April 2012, Davis debuted live her band Tenderloin as part of the festival &quot;Camp/Anti-Camp: A Queer Guide to Everyday Life&quot; at Hebbel am Ufer. Tenderloin&#x27;s line-up consisted of Felix Knoke, Jan Klesse, Joel Gibb, and Vaginal Davis performing under the alias &quot;Dagmar Hofpfisterei.&quot;. In August 2012 the band was invited by curator Anthony Hegarty to perform at this year&#x27;s Meltdown Festival at the Southbank Centre in London with Kembra Pfahler and the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black. After the performances Tenderloin released the music video for &quot;The Golden One&quot; that featured drag queen the Goddess Bunny and was directed by Glen Meadmore.

From November 9 to December 16, 2012, Davis opened her first major solo exhibition of solely visual art (as opposed to performance art), titled &quot;HAG – small, contemporary, haggard&quot; at the Participant Inc. in New York. The name of the show is based on the gallery that Davis hosted in her Los Angeles apartment from 1982–89.

Davis has traveled to various universities and educational institutions to give lectures on her life experiences, including a talk on youth hosteling at New York University&#x27;s Performance Studies complex in November 2015 with German actress and friend Susanne Sachsse. From December 1 to 5 of the same year, Davis teamed with avant-garde music group Xiu Xiu when they composed the score for her radical re-imagining of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Magic Flute,&quot; performed at the 80WSE Gallery at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, in partnership with Berlin&#x27;s CHEAP Kollectiv.

In mid-October 2016, Davis was a keynote speaker at the Creative Time Summit in Washington, D.C., a conference on art and social issues which featured workshops and speeches on topics ranging from the Black Lives Matter movement to electoral politics.

In 2024, her work was included in &quot;Xican-a.o.x. Body&quot; a major group exhibition at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida, which traveled from the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art &amp; Culture of the Riverside Art Museum, California. A scholarly publication was released by Chicago University Press in tandem with the show. 

==Artistry==
Davis has been accepted as an artist in the queer community more recently, but &quot;the gay world [only] became more open to what [she] did after [she] established [her]self outside of the gay world.&quot; For many years, Davis felt as though she was &quot;too gay for the punk scene and too punk for the gay.&quot;

José Esteban Muñoz has identified Davis as a progenitor of &quot;terrorist drag,&quot; for Davis was neither &quot;glamour&quot; like New York performers Candis Cayne and Girlina, nor &quot;clown&quot; (camp) like drag queens Varla Jean Merman and Lady Bunny. According to Davis, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really trying to alter myself to look like a real woman. I didn&#x27;t wear false eyelashes or fake breasts. It wasn&#x27;t about the real-ness of traditional drag – the perfect flawless makeup. I just put on a little lipstick, a little eyeshadow and a wig and went there.&quot; Davis has several drag personas, including Princess Sellica the Sensual Psychic, R&amp;B legend Lestar Vartan and Lieutenant Vaginal Davis of the Sexualese Liberation Front. Dominic Johnson of &quot;Frieze&quot; said, &quot;Ms Davis consistently refuses to ease conservative tactics within gay and black politics, employing punk music, invented biography, insults, self-mockery, and repeated incitements to group sexual revolt.&quot; Davis has been critical of the co-optation of African, Hispanic, and LGBT culture by the mainstream.

Davis&#x27; performances are also, according to journalist Ali Fitzgerald, &quot;giddy, satirical stabs at the old-world order, leveling criticism at white privilege and the patriarchy with nuanced wit and game-show-style camp. The Vaginal Davis persona is a complex mixture of queercore punk antics and MGM studio glamour, reflecting Davis&#x27; socially engaged and aesthetically consistent interests.&quot; She was also a muse to German choreographer Pina Bausch, as well as fashion designer Rick Owens and photographer Catherine Opie. Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu also stated that &quot;I am bi and found artists that were androgynous hit me hard – Peter Murphy, David Bowie, Morrissey. But there was a drag queen named Vaginal Davis that changed my life. I had no idea you could be punk and a drag queen and ultra intense and insane and hot and brilliant all at the same time.&quot;

Davis also claims, in a 2015 interview with &quot;Bedford and Brooklyn&quot;″s Nicole Disser, that much of her artwork and performances are inspired by her late mother&#x27;s artistic ability, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m so intertwined with my mother. My whole career as an artist, and all of my visual art, is basically co-opting my mother. My mother didn&#x27;t consider herself an artist, she just made stuff. Looking back to the things that she did, they were installations, assemblages – things in the art world that have proper names to them – she was doing this way back then. If I get any notice for any of my artworks or any of my performances, it&#x27;s because I just copied my mother.&quot;

In 2018, Davis was awarded $10,000 U.S. Dollars for receiving the Sustained Achievement Award from the non-profit organization Queer|Art, which offers support and mentorship to LGBTQIA+ identifying artists.

<doc id="548318" wikidata="Q60505" url="?curid=548318" title="Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828–1885)">
<text>Prince Friedrich Karl Nikolaus of Prussia (20 March 1828 – 15 June 1885) was the son of Prince Charles of Prussia (1801–1883) and his wife, Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1808–1877). Prince Friedrich Karl was a grandson of King Frederick William III of Prussia and a nephew of Frederick William IV and William I. 

As a military commander, the Prince had a major influence on the Royal Prussian Army&#x27;s advances in training and tactics in the 1850s and 1860s. He commanded one of the armies which defeated the Austrian army at the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866 and the French Army of the Rhine at the Battle of Mars-la-Tour, overseeing the defeat of the Army of the Rhine at the Siege of Metz in 1870.

==Biography==
Friedrich Karl was born at the Royal Palace in Berlin on 20 March 1828, as the only son of Prince Charles of Prussia, the brother of future German emperor William I. From 1842 to 1846, Frederick Charles was under the military tutelage of then Major Albrecht von Roon. In 1845, the Prince joined the army and was sent to an infantry company. Roon accompanied the Prince to the University of Bonn in 1846. He was the first Hohenzollern prince to study in a university. He became a member of the Corps Borussia Bonn in 1847 and was awarded Prussia&#x27;s Lifesaving Medal for rescuing a child from the Rhine the same year. After his studies, the Prince went back to his regiment in 1848, where he was promoted to captain. His company was issued the breech-loading Dreyse needle gun and the Prince produced an article on its probable future impact, writing that the troops could be prevented from firing off all their ammunition through good training and discipline. He served on Friedrich Graf von Wrangel&#x27;s staff during the First Schleswig War of 1848. During the war Friedrich Karl received the Pour le Mérite. He shifted to the cavalry branch in October 1848 and was promoted to major in June 1849. He partook in a campaign in the Baden Revolution of 1849, during which he was wounded twice while leading a Guards Hussar squadron at the battle of Wiesenthal against Baden rebels. He continued to lead his squadron up till 1852.

In 1851, the Prince wrote a radical field manual for light troops, underlining the importance of training individual soldiers to take the initiative and not wait for orders. During the following peace years he was promoted to colonel in 1852 and granted the command of the Guards Dragoon Regiment, where he introduced realistic field exercises and insisted on combat readiness. He became major general and commander of the 1st Guards Cavalry Brigade in 1854 and lieutenant general in 1856. He commanded the 1st Guards Infantry Division from 19 February to 18 September 1857, but resigned after encountering significant opposition to his approach on training. In 1859, he published the study &quot;On French Tactics&quot;, which highlighted the decisiveness of troop morale. In 1860, the Prince published a military book, titled, &quot;Eine militärische Denkschrift von P. F. K.&quot;, which contained a series of reform proposals. As commander of III Army Corps from 1 July 1860 to 17 July 1870, the Prince implemented his reforms and turned his corps into a leader in Prussian military innovation. 

Promoted to &quot;General der Kavallerie&quot;, the Prince took part in the Second Schleswig War of 1864 against Denmark, where he held command over the Prussian troops in the Austro-Prussian expeditionary force and defeated the Danes at the Battle of Dybbøl. In May 1864, he became supreme commander of the Austro-Prussian allied army and conquered Jutland. 

He served with distinction in the Austro-Prussian War where he commanded the First Army, consisting of the II, III, IV, and Cavalry corps. At the start of the war the prince&#x27;s army marched to the East. This caused a gap between the First Army and the Second Army, however enabled it to link up with the Army of the Elbe. On June 28, the Prince and Karl Eberhard Herwarth von Bittenfeld attacked the Austrian Army at Munchengratz. They gained a victory in that battle and caused the Austrians to retreat to Jičín. On 29 June 1866, the prince ordered August von Werder, commanding the 3rd Division, to fight against the Austrians at Jičín. The 3rd Division was victorious in the resulting Battle of Gitschin but the campaign was ill regarded by the headquarters as it was outside of the strategic plans of King William of Prussia. Friedrich Karl was disappointed by the German General Staff in return. Meanwhile the combined operation of the two armies strained the supply lines and both Armies were starving. Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke inferred that the operational aim of Friedrich Karl was not to unite with the Second Army at Jičín but to capture Prague on his own. Before the Battle of Königgrätz, the troops of the prince were at Kamenitz. By his command the First Army was the first to arrive at Königgrätz. Along with the Army of the Elbe, the First Army held the numerically superior Austrians at bay for seven hours from 08:00 to 15:00, inflicting such massive casualties on the Austrians that it took the arrival of just one division from the Second Army, the latter commanded by his cousin the Crown Prince Frederick William, to complete the victory and cause the Austrians to order a general withdrawal at 15:00. The First Army then marched on Vienna. After the war, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Pour le Mérite.
He was elected to the North German Reichstag in the February 1867 North German federal election, representing the East Prussian constituency of Labiau-Wehlau.

At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the Prince was given command of the Second Army, and defeated the French Army of the Rhine at the Battle of Mars-la-Tour on 16 August 1870, cutting off its escape route to the west. The battle was followed by another victory at Gravelotte-St.Privat on 18 August and the encirclement and annihilation of the Army of the Rhine at the Siege of Metz. After the fall of Metz on 27 October, his army was sent to the Loire to clear the area around Orléans, where French armies, first under Aurelle de Paladines, then under Chanzy, were trying to march north to relieve Paris. He won battles at Orléans on 2 December and Le Mans from 10–12 January 1871. For his services he was promoted to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall. After the war, the Prince was made Inspector-General and was given the rank of Field Marshal of Russia by his cousin Alexander II of Russia.

He died of a heart attack at Jagdschloss Glienicke on 15 June 1885. He became the namesake of the armored cruiser .

==Family==

<text>Drumstick is the brand name, owned by Froneri, a joint venture between Nestlé and PAI Partners, for a variety of frozen dessert-filled ice cream cones sold in the United States, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and other countries. The original product was invented by I.C. Parker of the Drumstick Company of Fort Worth, Texas, in 1928.

==Overview==
A typical drumstick consists of a sugar cone filled with vanilla frozen dairy dessert topped with a hardened chocolate shell and nuts, and much later, with a chocolate-lined cone and a chunk of chocolate at the bottom invented at the West End factory in Brisbane. Normally the ice cream would soak into the moist cone during the manufacturing process which would have made it soggy and unpalatable when served, however this problem is overcome by insulating the inside of the waffle cone from the ice cream with a coating of oil, sugar, and chocolate. A hard chocolate shell at the top of the sugar cone holds it shape in case the ice cream starts to melt. 

Drumsticks are available from a variety of supermarkets, ice cream trucks, and convenience stores. In the case of drumsticks labelled for individual sale, they are packaged in a rigid plastic wrapper. 

Due to the historic popularity of this dessert, it is commonly called a &quot;drumstick&quot; even if it is manufactured by some other company and branded otherwise. &quot;Forever Summer&quot; has been a tagline for this brand.

==History==
In 1928, the Parker BrothersBruce, I.C., and J.T.added to the invention of the waffle cone by adding a chocolate coating with nuts to it. One of the brothers&#x27; wives said that this invention looked like a chicken leg, commonly nicknamed a drumstick in the US.

Nestlé purchased the Drumstick Company in 1991. In 2016, Nestlé and PAI Partners established Froneri, a joint venture to combine the two companies&#x27; ice cream activities.

In 2019, a cereal from General Mills based on Drumsticks was released with two flavors, vanilla and mint chocolate.

==Flavors==
Additional varieties of Drumstick include caramel and fudge-filled cones, Mint Chocolate Crunch, Cookies and Cream Crunch, and simply dipped, cones filled with caramel, chocolate, and plain vanilla are also found. In Canada, Nestlé offers a chocolate dipped Oreo Drumstick as well as Strawberry Cheesecake Drumstick.

According to the official website, the following Drumstick flavors are produced:

* Classic
* Simply Dipped
* Pretzel Dipped
* Crunch Dipped
* Cookie Dipped
* Mini Drums
* Lil’ Drums
* Sprinkled!
* Super Nugget
* King Size
==Non-dairy additions==
In early 2020, Nestlé released two vegan varieties of the dessert in Canada.
*Caramel
*Vanilla Chocolate Swirl
On April 16, 2021, Nestlé Canada recalled both flavours over concerns that the products may contain dairy not included on the ingredients label.

<doc id="548341" wikidata="Q2612208" url="?curid=548341" title="Jacob Broom">
<text>Jacob Broom (October 17, 1752 – April 25, 1810) was an American Founding Father, businessman, and politician from Wilmington, Delaware. As a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, he was a signer of the United States Constitution. He was also appointed as a delegate to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 but did not attend, and he served in the Delaware General Assembly. He was the father of Congressman James M. Broom and grandfather of Congressman Jacob Broom.

== Early life ==
His father was James Broom, a blacksmith turned prosperous farmer, and his mother was Esther Willis, a Quaker. In 1773 he married Rachel Pierce, and together they raised eight children.

==Constitutional Convention==

Broom was a dedicated supporter of a strong central government who had been appointed as a commissioner to the Annapolis Convention in 1786, although he failed to attend. When George Washington visited Wilmington in 1783, Broom urged him to &quot;contribute your advice and influence to promote that harmony and union of our infant governments which are so essential to the permanent establishment of our freedom, happiness, and prosperity.&quot;

Broom carried these opinions with him to Philadelphia, where he consistently voted for measures that would assure a powerful government responsive to the needs of the states. He favored a nine-year term limit for members of the Senate, where the states would be equally represented. He wanted the state legislatures to pay their representatives in Congress, which, in turn, would have the power to veto state laws. He also sought to vest state legislatures with the power to select presidential electors, and he wanted the president to hold office for life. Broom faithfully attended the sessions of the Convention in Philadelphia and spoke out several times on issues that he considered crucial, but he left most of the speech-making to more influential and experienced delegates. Georgia delegate William Pierce described him as &quot;a plain good Man, with some abilities, but nothing to render him conspicuous. He is silent in public, but cheerful and conversable in private.&quot;

==Later career==

After the convention, Broom returned to Wilmington, where in 1795 he built a home near Brandywine Creek on the outskirts of the city. Broom&#x27;s primary interest remained in local government. In addition to continuing his service in Wilmington&#x27;s government, he became the city&#x27;s first postmaster in 1790. For many years, he chaired the board of directors of Wilmington&#x27;s Delaware Bank. He also operated a cotton mill, as well as a machine shop that produced and repaired mill machinery. In 1802 He sold his mill property, which became the center of the DuPont manufacturing empire. Broom was also involved in an unsuccessful scheme to mine bog iron ore. A further interest was internal improvements: toll roads, canals, and bridges. A letter to his son James in 1794 touches upon a number of these pursuits. Broom also found time for philanthropic and religious activities. His long-standing affiliation with the Old Academy led him to become involved in its reorganization into the College of Wilmington, and to serve on the college&#x27;s first Board of Trustees. Broom was also deeply involved in his community&#x27;s religious affairs as a lay leader of the Old Swedes Church.

==Death and legacy==
He died at age 57 in 1810 while in Philadelphia on business and was buried there at Christ Church Burial Ground. A cenotaph was placed in his honor at the Christ Episcopal Church by the Delaware State Society in 1987. His home near the Brandywine, the Jacob Broom House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Broom Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor.

<text>Point Edward is a village in the Canadian province of Ontario. Adjacent to the city of Sarnia in Lambton County, Point Edward sits opposite Port Huron, Michigan and is connected to it by the Blue Water Bridge, at the meeting point of the St. Clair River and Lake Huron. Formerly called Huron, it was renamed in 1860 to mark the visit by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. It was incorporated in 1879. In the Canada 2016 Census, the population of Point Edward was 2,037, an increase of 0.1 percent from its 2011 population of 2,034.

In the summer of 2003, Point Edward celebrated its 125th anniversary.

==Municipal government==
The current mayor of Point Edward is Bev Hand.

In the late 1980s, the provincial government initiated a plan to amalgamate Point Edward with the larger city of Sarnia, although many residents opposed the merger and the plan was abandoned in 1991. Even under the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario government of Premier Mike Harris, which forced amalgamations of many municipalities in the province (including of many towns which were geographically distinct settlements) in the late 1990s, Point Edward remained untouched. Despite this, some municipal government services in Point Edward are provided on contract by the city of Sarnia. For example, Point Edward is served by both Sarnia Transit and Bluewater Power Distribution, Sarnia&#x27;s municipally-owned hydroelectricity provider.

==Economy==

Most businesses in Point Edward are independently owned. The only franchises located in the village are hotels and the Gateway Casino Point Edward.

== Arena ==

The Point Edward Arena is a year round facility consisting of an ice rink with an attached recreational hall . It hosts ice hockey and figure skating events in the winter as well as specialized flooring for other sports held in the summer. The facility is open for rent to the public for special events and tournament hosting. The Point Edward Arena is also the home of the Point Edward Blackhawks Minor Hockey Team.

== Schools ==

Point Edward is home to Bridgeview Public School. It was opened in the late 1940s to house the growing number of children in the village. The previous school was located where Optimist Park currently is. Bridgeview houses grades from junior kindergarten to Grade 8. It also has one of the best outfitted classroom facilities for special needs students in Southwestern Ontario. The Lambton Kent District School Board has closed a number of elementary schools due to low capacity, although Bridgeview remains open because of the highly valued special needs facilities.

==Transportation==

Federal Bridge Corporation operates and maintains the Blue Water Bridge, a twin-span bridge across the Saint Clair River to Michigan, along with its associated customs and immigration facilities. The company has bought and closed several houses along St. Clair and Alexandra Ave. It owns and maintains a great deal of land in Point Edward, but there is little room left for expansion.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Point Edward had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="548374" wikidata="Q3492487" url="?curid=548374" title="Greenstone, Ontario">
<text>Greenstone is a single-tier municipality in the Canadian province of Ontario with a population of 4,636 according to the 2016 Canadian census. It stretches along Highway 11 from Lake Nipigon to Longlac and covers .

The town was formed in 2001, as part of municipal re-organization under the Progressive Conservative government of Ontario. It combined the former Townships of Beardmore and Nakina, the Towns of Geraldton and [[Longlac]] with large unincorporated portions of Unorganized Thunder Bay District.

It is the administrative office of the band government for the Animbiigoo Zaagi&#x27;igan Anishinaabek First Nation.

==Communities==
Greenstone includes the communities of Beardmore, Caramat, Geraldton, Jellicoe, Longlac, Macdiarmid, Nakina and Orient Bay. The municipal administrative offices are located in Geraldton. Nakina and Caramat are entirely exclaved from the rest of the municipality&#x27;s territory.

==History==
T. L. Taunton, of the Geological Survey of Canada, noted gold in quartz fragments around Little Long Lac in 1917. Similarly, Tony Oklend found ore in a boulder during World War I. However, it wouldn&#x27;t be until 1931 that Bill &quot;Hard Rock&quot; Smith and Stan Watson would stake 18 claims along 3 veins. Tom Johnson and Robert Wells filed claims based on gold appearing in Magnet Lake quartz outcrop and the presence of bismuthinite. The Bankfield Gold Mine developed from these claims. In 1932, Johnson and Oklend staked 12 claims at Little Long Lac. Fred MacLeod and Arthur Cockshutt filed 15 claims near Smith&#x27;s.

Nakina was established in 1923 as a station and railway yard on the National Transcontinental Railway, between the divisional points of Grant and Armstrong. Nakina was at Mile 15.9 of the NTR&#x27;s Grant Sub-Division. Following the completion in 1924 of the Longlac-Nakina Cut-Off by the Canadian National Railway, connecting the rails of the Canadian Northern Railway at Longlac and the NTR, Nakina became the new divisional point, and the buildings from the town of Grant ( to the east) were moved to the new Nakina town site.

In the 1930s the Beardmore Relics, Viking Age artifacts were found near Beardmore, which were proposed to be evidence of Vikings in Ontario. Later, the relics were proven to have been a hoax. Through a series of witnesses as well as the son of the person who had found them, the relics were found to have been planted in Beardmore and not, as was suggested, found there.

By 1934, a gold rush absorbed the area from Long Lac to Nipigon, a belt long and wide. The village of Hard Rock was established in 1934, and Longlac, Bankfield, and Geraldton soon followed. Though a 1936 fire threatened the mines, development was able to continue.

As an important railway service stop from 1923 until 1986, the town had a railway round-house as well as a watering and fuelling capability. During World War II, there was also a radar base on the edge of the town, intended to watch for a potential attack on the strategically important Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie. Research into the radar site in the Library and Archives Canada indicates that it was largely a United States Army Air Forces operation, pre-dating the Pinetree Line radar bases that were erected to focus on the Cold War threat. The Nakina base was totally removed shortly after the war.

The settlement of Geraldton is a compound of the surname of financiers of a nearby gold mine near Kenogamisis Lake in 1931 (Fitzgerald and Errington).

The Geraldton-Beardmore Gold Camp, in the heart of the Canadian Shield, hosts numerous mineralized zones which continue to be explored for potential development. Eight gold mines operated here between 1936 and 1970.

Tom Powers and Phil Silams staked what became the Northern Empire Mine (1925–1988) near Beardmore, which produced a total of 149,493 ounces of gold. The Little Long Lac Mine (1934–1953) produced 605,449 ounces of gold, besides producing scheelite. J.M. Wood and W.T. Brown developed the Sturgeon River Gold Mine (1936–1942), which produced 73,438 ounces of gold. James and Russell Cryderman found and Karl Springer incorporated what became known as the Leitch Gold Mine (1936–1968), which produced 861,982 ounces of gold from 0.92 grade ore. The Bankfield Gold Mines produced 66,416 ounces by 1942. Tomball Mines (1938–1942), started by Tom and Bill Johnson, produced 69,416 ounces. The Magnet Mine (1938–1942) produced 152,089 ounces. The Hard Rock Mine (1938–1951) produced 269,081 ounces, while the MacLeod-Cockshutt (1938–1970) produced 1,516,980 ounces.

In the 1970s pulp and paper operations near the town resulted in growth in the town&#x27;s population to its peak of approximately 1,200. However, at this point, cost controls in the railway industry meant that service and maintenance could be consolidated at points much more distant from one another than had been common in the first half of the 20th century. As a result, the value of Nakina as a railway service community was greatly diminished, to the point where the railway was no longer a substantial employer in the town. Also in the 1970s, a radio station was launched in Longlac as CHAP on the AM dial; this station left the air by the late 1970s.

The town remains focused on tourism, diminished pulp and paper operations and support of other more northern communities (food, fuel and transportation). Mining and minerals industries are seen as a potential source of further growth. 

, a proposed ore transport point around Nakina, as part of the Ring of Fire development, may shift the emphasis of local industry from logging back to mining. In 2010 the Ring of Fire development, proposed James Bay rail link and placement of processing plants remains of great economic interest for the region. Development was expected to cost more than $1.5 billion. In 2019, negotiations with communities were continuing.

On 19 February 2011, Beardmore was temporarily evacuated after a major explosion ruptured the TransCanada pipeline in the community.

In May 2016, the municipality was placed under a state of emergency due to the approach of forest fires. Flames reached within 500m of the municipal buildings in Geraldton and crossed the runway of the town&#x27;s airport, but no structures were lost.

On August 29, 2024, the Greenstone gold mine was officially opened, bringing gold mining back to Greenstone for the first time since the 1970s.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Greenstone had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Government==
Greenstone&#x27;s mayor is James McPherson.

The Greenstone Public Library has branches in Beardmore, Geraldton (the Elsie Dugard Centennial Branch), Longlac and Nakina (the Helen Mackie Memorial Branch).

== Insignia ==
On 4 March 2006 Letters Patent were presented by the Canadian Heraldic Authority, granting arms, flag and badge to the Corporation of the Municipality of Greenstone. The flag consists in a banner of arms while the badge is described as: on a miner&#x27;s pick and a double-bitted axe in saltire Argent hafted Vert, a railway wheel Or charged with a grey wolf&#x27;s head erased proper.

==Climate==

Greenstone experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with cold winters and warm summers. The highest temperature ever recorded in the area was on 11 and 12 July 1936 at Longlac. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 31 January 1996 (at Geraldton Airport).

==Transportation==

Greenstone lies along Highway 11, the northern branch of the Trans-Canada Highway through Northern Ontario. It has airports in Geraldton and Nakina.

The municipality is served by Via Rail services at Longlac, Nakina, and Caramat stations. 

==In film==
The First Nations television series &quot;Spirit Bay&quot; was shot here by the CBC in the mid-1980s at the Biinjitiwaabik Zaaging Anishinaabek First Nation Reserve near MacDiarmid. The film &quot;Coconut Hero&quot; was also filmed partially in Geraldton.

<text>The third USS &quot;Luce&quot; (DLG-7/DDG-38) was Farragut-class guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy that served from 1962 until discarded in 1992. The ship was named for Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce (1827–1917). &quot;Luce&quot; was sold for scrapping in 2005.

==History==
&quot;Luce&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 1 October 1957. The ship was launched on 11 December 1958, sponsored by the wife of Felix Stump, and commissioned on 20 May 1961 Commander David H. Bagley in command. USS &quot;Luce&quot; was reclassified as a guided missile destroyer on 30 June 1975 and designated DDG-38.

&quot;Luce&quot; departed Mayport, Florida, on her shakedown cruise 14 February 1962. She spent the month of April with the U.S. 6th Fleet in her first task force operations, and returned home 11 May, where Capt. H. J. Ereckson, Commander of Destroyer Division 84, made her his flagship. She departed 3 August to rejoin the 6th Fleet, en route participating in NATO exercises Riptide III with units of the British and French navies. In the next 7 months she joined in three major NATO exercises before returning home 2 March 1963. During the spring and early summer, the guided missile destroyer conducted missile tests, trained midshipmen, and engaged in independent exercises along the Atlantic coast.

On 20 August 1963 she steamed to the Caribbean Sea for independent air, surface, and shore bombardment firings, and returned to Mayport 4 September. She joined Task Force 23 for intensive antisubmarine warfare (ASW) and anti-aircraft (AA) exercises 28 October, and after a short operation with the aircraft carrier was back in Mayport for tender availability.

On 8 February 1964 she again joined the 6th Fleet, and was called upon to stand guard for 3 weeks near the unsettled island of Cyprus to evacuate American citizens if necessary. She hosted the Secretary of the Navy and Commander 6th Fleet 24 April for a missile firing demonstration, and then escorted the carrier on a high‑speed Atlantic crossing to Mayport, where she arrived 23 May.

In July the ship steamed to New York City to participate in operation &quot;Sail&quot; with a regatta of sailing craft from all over the world. She returned to Mayport after a 4-month overhaul 28 January 1965. The frigate had won both the Engineering and Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;s during 1964.

&quot;Luce&quot; returned to the Caribbean for intensive refresher training in March 1965. On 29 April she embarked a company of marines at Guantanamo Bay and proceeded to the troubled Dominican Republic 30 April. She patrolled the coast of the politically disturbed island until 8 May. She returned to the Mediterranean Sea in June for 4 months of operations with units of the Spanish, French, Greek, and Italian navies. In September she operated with the destroyer in the Black Sea, and she returned to the Mediterranean late in 1965. She arrived Mayport 6 November and embarked Commander Destroyer Squadron 8. In December she engaged in missile firing and after a brief time in port in 1966 continued testing and improving missile techniques and carrying out the fleet&#x27;s widespread peacekeeping activities which guard the free world.

On 19 January 1966 an &quot;actual nuclear incident&quot; occurred when the nuclear warhead on a Terrier anti-air missile separated from the missile and dropped about eight feet on the &quot;Luce&quot; while the ship was docked at Mayport Naval Station. It is recorded that &quot;there were no personnel casualties, and aside from the dent in the warhead, no equipment was damaged.&quot;

On 13 June 1966 &quot;Luce&quot; got underway for deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. After participating in various exercises with United States and other allied ships, and representing the United States at two international trade fairs, she returned to Mayport on 26 October. The first half of 1967 saw &quot;Luce&quot; operating again in the Atlantic and Caribbean, and participating in a midshipmen training cruise in June. On 7 August, &quot;Luce&quot; began a regular overhaul at the U.S. Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina. She continued in overhaul until early 1968, then operated locally and in the Caribbean until departing Mayport 14 September for the Persian Gulf, sailing via Recife, Brazil, and various ports along the west and east coasts of Africa. She arrived at Bahrain 29 October and continued to stand watch over the troubled Middle East into 1969.

==Fate==
&quot;Luce&quot; was decommissioned on 1 April 1991 at Naval Base Mayport, Florida, and stricken from the Navy list on 20 November 1992. On 16 December 1994, &quot;Luce&quot; was sold for scrapping and on 17 June 2005, the scrapping was completed.

<text>A postal worker is one who works for a post office, such as a mail carrier. In the U.S., postal workers are represented by the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL–CIO, National Postal Mail Handlers Union – NPMHU, the National Association of Rural Letter Carriers and the American Postal Workers Union, part of the AFL–CIO. In Canada, they are represented by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and in the United Kingdom by the Communication Workers Union.

The US Postal Service employs around 584,000 people. The bulk of these work as:

*Service clerks – Sell stamps and postage, help people pick up packages and assist with other services such as passports.
*Mail sorters – Physically sort the mail to go to the correct place. As automation has become more common, some of these people now operate the sorting machines.
*Mail carriers – Deliver the mail. In densely populated areas this is done on foot. In urban areas the carriers often use a mail truck and drive and walk different parts of their routes. In rural areas, carriers drive to most of their stops.
*Vehicle Operator – Drive the truck/vehicle carrying mails/pallets and dispatch from one place to another.

The phrase was not very often used until a spate of workplace violence incidents by postal workers in the mid-1990s made headlines; the incidents led to the coining of the phrase &quot;going postal&quot;.

<doc id="548391" wikidata="Q720322" url="?curid=548391" title="John Deighton">
<text>John Deighton (November 1830 – May 23, 1875), better known as &quot;Gassy Jack&quot;, was a bar-owner in British Columbia. The Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia takes its name from him.

== History ==

Deighton was born in Hull, England. Growing up in Hull, a major seaport, Deighton and his brothers Tom and Richard learned to sail. Tom and Richard apprenticed on British ships, but Jack did not receive that opportunity. However, this meant he could switch to sailing on U.S. ships. When the California Gold Rush hit, ships were in demand to transport cargo and people from New York to San Francisco. In 1850, this voyage around Cape Horn took 140–160 days. Deighton signed up to work a new clipper &quot;Invincible&quot; that could sail 400 miles a day and made the trip in only 115 days. The next journey was to Hong Kong. Deighton was 21 years old and Third Officer. Next, Deighton visited family at home in England and then returned to the U.S., never returning to England again.

Next, Deighton worked a gold claim in California, along with many others, until February 1858 when there was news of gold further north in a British territory known as New Caledonia. The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush had begun and Deighton sailed north along with thousands of others. The harsh winter took its toll on the prospectors but Deighton stayed for 5 years. He found no gold, though others did. New Caledonia was now the Colony of British Columbia. Traffic on the Fraser River was increasing as more miners arrived, but so far only American steamers were able to travel beyond Langley. Local boats were built to meet this need and Deighton piloted steamships and sternwheelers on the Fraser River for several years.

By 1864, Deighton was forced to pursue other lines of work as he developed health problems (swelling of the legs and feet).

Between 1862 and 1867, he ran a bar called the Globe Saloon in New Westminster, British Columbia. It was quite prosperous due to the Cariboo Gold Rush. In 1867, when Deighton went out of town to visit the hot mineral springs near Harrison Lake, he entrusted the bar to an old shipmate, an American. On July 4, the celebrations got out of hand and Deighton returned to find his business ruined.

In 1867, Deighton opened a bar on the south side of Burrard Inlet at the behest of his old friend, Captain Edward Stamp, the owner of the Hastings Mill. He later named it the Globe Saloon in memory of his previous bar in New Westminster. He came to the area with little more than $6 to his name, a few simple pieces of furniture, his Indigenous wife (whose name has been lost to the years), and a yellow dog. The bar was built by idle sawmill workers in exchange for all the whisky they could drink in one sitting (the nearest drinking hole was 25 miles away). His patrons were mainly sailors and workers from the nearby sawmill. When business dwindled there, Deighton tried to acquire 20 waterfront acres near Moody&#x27;s Mill and build a new saloon there. The local natives protested and the Governor agreed with them – Deighton went back to his previous bar, the Globe Saloon. This bar was demolished when the townsite of Granville was established. Deighton bought a nearby lot for $135 at the south-west corner of Carrall and Water Streets, where he built Deighton House.

Deighton was first married to a Squamish woman, whose name is currently unknown. Before her death around 1870, her niece, Quahail-ya, came to care for her. After her death, Deighton married Quahail-ya who was also known by the name Madeline Deighton. According to the 1921 Canadian Census, she was born in 1855 or 1856, but other sources suggest other dates. In 1940, she told Vancouver archivist Major J.S. Matthews that she was &quot;about 12&quot; when she married Deighton in 1870. Matthews reported that &quot;it was difficult to converse.&quot; In 1946, after a portrait of her by Vancouver artist Mildred Valley Thornton was featured in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, she was described in an article as being &quot;well over 90 years old.&quot; Newspaper stories on her death in 1948 noted she was &quot;reputed to be over 100 years of age&quot; and that she &quot;claimed to be between 102 and 110 years of age.&quot;

A son, Richard Mason Deighton, was born to Deighton and his wife in December 1871; the baby was baptized in 1872. Richard was nicknamed the &quot;Earl of Granville&quot; and was a popular figure in Gastown. (In her 1940 interview with Major Matthews, Madeline said the baby lived about two years and was buried at Brockton Point, but in fact he outlived his father.) Deighton&#x27;s brother Tom and his wife took over the business in 1873 and Deighton returned to working the steamship that plied the Fraser River, this time as a captain of the steamer &quot;Onward&quot;. However, after a family quarrel a few months later, he resumed management of the saloon and operated it until he became ill and died at the age of 44 on May 23, 1875. Deighton&#x27;s will left everything to his four-year-old son, but Richard died in November 1875 before the will was probated. It is not known who inherited the $304, but Quahail-ya/Madeline was reimbursed for three months of childcare and the expenses of her son&#x27;s funeral. She returned to the North Shore and married Billy Williams, who died in 1897. She died August 10, 1948.

==Legacy==

Deighton is interred at the Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster, British Columbia. A headstone was installed in 1972, reading &quot;Here lies John &#x27;Gassy Jack&#x27; Deighton, 1830 - 1875, Sailor, Prospector, Steamboatman, Pioneer, Hotelman at New Westminster &amp; Granville: &#x27;I have done well since I came here.&#x27;&quot; The location of the monument is (WGS84).

Deighton was known as Gassy Jack because of his talkative nature and his penchant for storytelling. Locals called the area around his bar &quot;Gastown&quot; though its proper name at the time was Granville.

The Deighton House was later burned in the Great Vancouver Fire of June 1886.

In honour of Jack Deighton, the Gassy Jack statue stood in Maple Tree Square in Gastown which was the former site of his saloon, until it was toppled and covered with paint by demonstrators on February 14, 2022, during the 31st annual Memorial March for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

<text>The Knights of the Cross with the Red Star (, , , postnominal initials: O.Cr., O.Crucig.), also known as the Military Order of the Crusaders of the Red Star is a Catholic religious order present in the Czech Republic and Austria. It is the only religious order originating from Bohemia and the only male religious order in the world founded by a woman. The spirituality of the Order nowadays consists of two pillars: The first is the pastoral care in the former so-called incorporated parishes, the second is the hospitaller charisma given to the Order in its beginnings by its founder, St. Agnes of Bohemia.

The Order is currently a community of canons regular. The institute of lay brothers, which existed in the Order throughout history, ceased to exist during the 18th century. The superior general of the Order receives an abbatial benediction and uses the title of Grand Master and General. His seat is in the Prague Crusader Monastery at the Old Town foot of the Charles Bridge.

The Order has 18 members, as of 1 January 2021.

== History of the Order ==


=== Medieval age ===
In 1233, St. Agnes of Bohemia founded a hospital fraternity of Franciscan tertiaries at her monastery in Prague. This community, inspired by the nursing military orders, was dedicated to the care of elderly, sick and other needy people. In 1235 the hospital was richly endowed by the Queen of Bohemia, Agnes&#x27;s mother, with property formerly belonging to the Teutonic Knights. A few years later, in 1237 the Order had been formally constituted under the Rule of St. Augustine by Pope Gregory IX. Despite relatively clear origins of the Order, its beginnings used to be subject of legends, especially in the Baroque period: Traditionally its roots were traced back to Holy Land. Nevertheless, in a parchment Breviary of the Order, dated 1356, the account of foundation contains no allusion to such a crusader lineage.

The Order moved to its present residence at the foot of the Prague Bridge in 1252, where its members not only took care of the hospital, but also became bridge keepers. The addendum &quot;at the foot of the Prague Bridge&quot; was attached to its name. The Order eventually spread its activities into other places in the Czech lands (České Budějovice, Cheb, Litoměřice, Stříbro, Znojmo-Hradiště, etc.). Thanks to Agnes&#x27;s sister, Princess Anna, the Order expanded even to Silesian capital Wrocław. Members of the Order used to wear arms, a custom which was confirmed in 1292 by the Pope Nicholas IV. The Grand Master is still invested with a sword. The Order has been later on recognized as a military order by popes Clement X and Innocent XII.

During the Hussite Wars in the 15th century, the mission of many order hospitals was interrupted and some of order houses (commanderies) completely disappeared. At critical moments, the residence of the Grand Master was also temporarily moved to Cheb. However, the Prague hospital continued to serve and survived the turbulent period throughout the wars. After the end of the revolutionary years, there was a certain transformation of the role of the order clergy: Due to the shortage of Catholic secular priests, the members of the Order began to be appointed as parish priests. Yet the Order never gave up hospitality and this charisma has persisted in various forms to the present day.

=== Early modern period ===
Thanks to several capable Grand Masters, the Order entered the early modern period in quite good condition. In 1562 the Grand Master Antonín Brus of Mohelnice even became Archbishop of Prague. This appointment marks the end of a long period of &quot;sede vacante&quot; of the St. Adalbert&#x27;s See. Since then, archbishops of Prague had held the post of Grand Master for almost a hundred and fifty years. The Order thus gained a prestigious role, yet at the same time it was obliged to economically support the impoverished Prague Diocese and to finance its development. 

Of this long period, the last two Grand Master on the St. Adalbert&#x27;s See, Arnost Vojtěch of Harrach and Jan Bedřich of Waldstein, are worth mentioning. Arnost Vojtěch of Harrach became the head of the Order in 1623 and was appointed Cardinal by Pope Urban VIII in 1626. He died in 1667, making him the longest serving Grand Master of the Order. After his death, Jan Bedřich of Waldstein became a new Grand Master, building on the work of his predecessor. He continued the reconstruction of the monastery at Charles Bridge, which he completed with the construction of a new church designed by the architect J. B. Mathey. In 1692, Jan Bedřich of Wallenstein, with the help of his later successor and then Prior of the Order, Jiří Ignác Pospíchal, completed the building of St. Agnes Hospital, which stood on the site of today&#x27;s Slavia Café at the corner of Národní třída in Prague.

The Order flourished also in the first half of the 18th century. Grand Master John Francis Franchimont of Frankenfeld was granted by Pope Clement XI the right to use mitre and other pontifical insignia (crosier, pectoral cross, ring) for himself and his successors. This right was later given also to the provost at the monastery of St. Hippolytus in Hradiště near Znojmo. (After the reforms related to the Second Vatican Council, only the Grand Master of the Order has this privilege.) During the 18th century the Order spread its activities to various places outside the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. In 1723 it was installed at the hospital of St. Martin and Leopold in Bratislava, in 1733 at the Karlskirche in Vienna. In 1770 Maria Theresa invested the Order with the administration of the prominent parish at Buda Castle. During this period, the Order hired great artists of the Baroque era. Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer built the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Karlovy Vary, while Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach built the Church of St. Charles Borromeo in Karlsplatz, Vienna. The painters Václav Vavřinec Reiner, Petr Brandl, Karel Škréta and Michael Willmann used to work for the Order.

=== 19th century ===
Even the last third of the 18th century was marked by significant changes in the life of the Order. Under the Josephine reforms, the hospitals in Prague (Písané lázně) and in Bratislava at St. Martin and Leopold were abolished. The trend towards the reduction of the role of the Order in health and social services was ongoing throughout the 19th century. The initiative of Grand Master Josef Antonín Köhler, who founded the first children&#x27;s a nursery in Bohemia in Prague-Karlín, can be described as a certain substitute, or perhaps a new expression, of the Order&#x27;s original charisma. Overall, though, the focus of the Order&#x27;s work was shifted to pastoral care in parishes.

During this period the Order was forced to give up most of its foreign locations for political reasons (Bratislava 1786, Wrocław 1810, Budapest 1882). However, these losses were compensated, especially in the late 19th and early 20th century, by the expansion of activities even in new locations in the Czech lands (Karlovy Vary-Rybáře, Věteřov).
From the history of the first half of the 19th century, we can also mention the fate of the Order&#x27;s member Karl Anton Postl, who illicitly left the Order in 1823 during a spa stay in Karlovy Vary and his trace was thereafter lost. It was only after his death that his further life story came to light: After his desertion from the Order, Postl became a successful writer, publishing under the pseudonym Charles Sealsfield.

Perhaps the most remarkable moment in the history of the Order in the 19th century was 3 December 1874. On this day St. Agnes of Bohemia, the founder of the Order, was beatified by Pope Pius IX. An important milestone was thus passed on the way to her later canonization, i.e. declaration as a saint. 

Even in the 19th century and especially at the beginning of the 20th century, the Order continued to carry out ambitious architectural projects. In addition to continual repairs and reconstruction of churches, parishes and estates, there are also larger construction projects. In the middle of the 19th century, the wing of the so-called Generalate of the Prague monastery was raised by one floor. At the very beginning of the 20th century, new churches and parishes were built in Karlovy Vary-Rybáře, Milhostov, Řevnice and Věteřov. All this culminates in the extensive reconstruction of the monastery near Charles Bridge, which was designed by the architect Josef Sakař and completed in 1912. Only the church, the Generalate and the late-gothic parts of the so-called Old Priory have been preserved. The other mostly early Baroque buildings were replaced by modern Art Nouveau – Neo-Baroque buildings. However, the efforts did not focus only on architecture. At this time, other important artists worked for the Order, particularly those from the so-called National Theatre Generation: Josef Václav Myslbek, František Ženíšek and Václav Brožík.

The economic aspect of the Order&#x27;s life cannot be overlooked either, though it will require further historical research. However, we already know that the Order&#x27;s brewery near Charles Bridge was the first one in the Czech lands to start bottling beer (1841).

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

==== 1900–1945 ====
The first decade of the service of Grand Master František Xaver Marat was marked by extensive building development of the Order, which was crowned by the reconstruction of the monastery at Charles Bridge (1908-1912). The tasks that awaited his successor and the second longest serving Grand Master Josef Vlasák were of a completely different nature. He took office during the hard years of World War I, continued through the difficult period of the First Republic followed by the years of Nazi occupation, and died during the Stalinist period of the Communist regime.

During the World War I, the Grand Master had to deal with a severe shortage of food for both the monastery and its hospital. After 1918, in the turbulent atmosphere of the young Czechoslovak republic and in the anti-Catholic sentiment that resonated in Czech society, there were talks about the dissolution of monasteries. This suppression would have had fatal consequences for the Order operating at that time only in the Czech lands. In this context, the Grand Master was preparing the possible relocation of the entire Order to the United States. Fortunately for the Church, the situation eventually stabilized, and the Order was able to continue to serve in its traditional locations. Despite the economic difficulties caused by the Czechoslovak land reform and the Great Depression, the Order continued its social activities and generously financed the restoration of the Convent of Saint Agnes in Prague - Na Františku and constructions of new churches in Prague&#x27;s suburbs.

After the Munich Agreement in 1938, when part of Czechoslovakia fell to Nazi Germany, a significant number of the Order&#x27;s parishes (in western Bohemia) found themselves outside the Czechoslovak borders.

Due to the sudden situation and with regard to the spiritual needs of the faithful in the parishes administered by the Order, an agreement was signed between the Order and the Cistercian Abbey of Vyšší Brod. The aim of the agreement was mutual assistance in pastoral care: The Crusaders took over the administration of Cistercian parishes in territories with Czech-speaking population; reciprocally some Crusader parishes in territories ceded to Germany were administered by Cistercians of Vyšší Brod.

In 1941, just before the death of the Archbishop of Prague, Cardinal Karel Kašpar, the Grand Master of the Order was forced by the Nazis to move to Brno, where he found shelter in the Augustinian Abbey in Old Brno. A year later, in 1942, the Order was forced by the German occupiers to leave its convent near Charles Bridge. At the end of the war, the Order even had to give up the ministry at the main church of the Order, St. Francis at Charles Bridge. During the war, some of the Order members were persecuted by Nazis: Karel Weis and Ladislav Sirový were imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. The end of World War II in May 1945 enabled the revival of religious life in the monastery near Charles Bridge. Due to the forced transfer of the German population of Czechoslovakia, the German-speaking members of the Order left for Germany along with their parishioners in 1946.

==== 1948–1989 ====
As part of &quot;Action K&quot;, the monastery was seized by the State Security (StB) on 27 April 1950. The Grand Master of the Order was destined to spend the rest of his life in the parish of St. Peter in Poříčí in respect of his advanced age. Other members of the Order were transported to concentration monasteries in Broumov, Králíky and Želiv. Certain members of the Order administering the Order´s parishes used to be persecuted and even imprisoned. A. Dragoun was convicted even twice: Firstly in 1951, then again in 1959. The longest sentence was imposed on J. Šebesta, a priest of the Order from the Parish Františkovy Lázně. He was sentenced to 17 years, part of which he would spend in a forced labour camp in the uranium ore mines in Jáchymov. The second longest sentence was imposed on B. Rákosník, priest of the Order from the Parish Kynšperk nad Ohří. He was sentenced to 13 years. Other members of the Order are then given less severe sentences. However, there were also members of the Order who, for various reasons, became involved with the totalitarian regime (Jan Mára, František Xaver Dítě). The vacant buildings of the monastery were first handed over to the Ministry of Health, then became one of the State Security (StB) headquarters. Nevertheless, the priests of the Order could still continue to serve at the main church of the Order – throughout the communist period there was always at least one Crusader priest at St. Francis. These priests of the Order who have not been withdrawn from “state approval” used to serve in various parishes. Member of the Order František Verner became the first librarian of the so-called Post-Conciliar Library (a library to help implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council) founded by Archbishop of Prague František Tomášek. Since the death of Grand Master Josef Vlasák in December 1958, the office had been vacant until 1988. In 1988, at the time of the mitigation of the state&#x27;s anti-church policy, Dr. Ladislav Sirový was elected the 46th Grand Master and General of the Order. He was installed in office by Cardinal František Tomášek in a private ceremony in the chapel of the Prague Archbishop&#x27;s Palace.

12 November 1989 became an important milestone in the history of the Order when its founder, St. Agnes of Bohemia, was canonized in Rome by Pope John Paul II.

==== 1989 till the present ====

After the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, the Order has returned to its monastery next to the Charles Bridge. The tragic event of 12 February 1992 marked the further course of the Order: The Grand Master Ladislav Sirový dies after a serious car accident. Regarding the personal situation, the election of a new Grand Master was not proceeded with. Bishop František Lobkowicz OPraem temporarily took over the administration of the Order by the will of the Holy See. It was only in 2001 that Jiří Kopejsko, a long-time provost at the Order&#x27;s pilgrimage site at Chlum Svaté Maří, became the 47th Grand Master of the Order. After his retirement in 2011, he was succeeded by the current 48th Grand Master Josef Šedivý, former parish priest of the Parish Věteřov near Kyjov, Doctor of Pharmacy by degree. 

In 2015, a member of the Order, Jaroslav Ptáček, was honoured by Pope Francis. For his merits for the Order and especially for the Order&#x27;s youth, he was awarded with the high papal decoration Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice.

Throughout the post-communist period, the Order has been striving to fulfil the charism of its saint founder: While Crusader priests still serve in former so-called incorporated parishes in the Czech Republic and Austria, the Order lives up to its original mission (patronage of the Girls Catholic High School, sponsorship of the Hospital of the Sisters of Mercy of St. Borromeo, foundation of the Crusader Nursing Service and the Crusader Home Hospice).

<doc id="548417" wikidata="Q1248238" url="?curid=548417" title="227 (TV series)">
<text>227 is an American sitcom television series that originally aired on NBC from September 14, 1985, to May 6, 1990. The series, created by C.J. Banks and Bill Boulware, stars Marla Gibbs as Mary Jenkins, a sharp-tongued, city resident gossip and housewife. Other main characters include her husband Lester (Hal Williams), their daughter Brenda (Regina King), landlady Rose Holloway (Alaina Reed Hall), and neighbors Sandra Clark (Jackée Harry) and Pearl Shay (Helen Martin).

==Origins==
The series was adapted from &quot;Two Twenty Seven&quot;, a stage play written in 1978 by Christine Houston about the lives of women in a predominantly black apartment building in 1950s Chicago. The setting of the series, however, was changed to present-day Washington, D.C. The show was created as a starring vehicle for Marla Gibbs, who had become famous as Florence Johnston, the maid on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, and had starred in Houston&#x27;s play in Los Angeles. This role was similar in nature to that of tart-tongued Florence; Gibbs&#x27;s character, housewife Mary Jenkins, loved a good gossip and often spoke what she thought, with sometimes not-so-favorable results. (Gibbs was also credited as a &quot;creative consultant&quot; for the series.)

According to Gibbs, &quot;227&quot; was originally offered to ABC but sold to NBC. Since &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; was still on the air on CBS, the new show was scheduled to begin in 1986. However, when &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; was abruptly and unexpectedly canceled in 1985, Gibbs was free to begin, and &quot;227&quot; went into production a year earlier than had been previously planned.

==Synopsis==
&quot;227&quot; followed the lives of people in a middle-class apartment building, 227 Lexington Place (the numerical address from which the sitcom&#x27;s name comes), in a black neighborhood in Northeast, Washington, D.C. The show was centered around Mary Jenkins (Marla Gibbs), a nosy and tart-tongued but loving housewife. Her husband, Lester Jenkins (Hal Williams), had his own construction company, and their daughter, Brenda (Regina King, in her first television acting role), was boy-crazy yet smart and studious.

Also cast in &quot;227&quot; was Sandra Clark (Jackée Harry), Mary&#x27;s younger neighbor who constantly bickered back and forth with her about their respective views on life. While Mary was a happily married housewife with a stable lifestyle, Sandra was a stylish, loose, man-hungry, somewhat ditzy diva, and a serial dater who dressed provocatively. Although their relationship was antagonistic at first, Mary and Sandra became good friends as time went on. Also living in the building was Pearl Shay (Helen Martin), a feisty but kind-hearted busybody neighbor who was known for snooping and had a sharp sense of humor. Pearl had a grandson named Calvin Dobbs (Curtis Baldwin), whom Brenda had a crush on and would finally date later in the series&#x27; run.

Rose Lee Holloway (Alaina Reed Hall) was Mary&#x27;s level-headed best friend and often the voice of reason among 227&#x27;s residents. She and Mary were often seen sitting on the front stoop of the building, exchanging rumors and gossip, with Pearl adding sly commentary and humor from her front window. In the premiere episode, Rose became the unexpected landlord of the building after the building&#x27;s stingy slumlord Mr. Calloway died. Rose stayed on as landlady until the fourth season (for season five, Paul Winfield was introduced as the building&#x27;s new snide, wealthy landlord Julian C. Barlow). Rose had a daughter named Tiffany Holloway (Kia Goodwin), who was Brenda&#x27;s closest friend. However, Goodwin&#x27;s mother was unhappy in California, so the child actor was released from her contract. She was written out of the series after the second season, although she was mentioned occasionally. 

In the first season, both Helen Martin and Curtis Baldwin, who had only been recurring stars, appeared in nearly every episode. From season 2 onward, they were upped to series regulars.

By the time taping started on the third season in 1987, Jackée Harry, who had just won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress, changed her stage name to simply Jackée, which she used until 1994. In the fourth season, an 11-year-old child prodigy named Alexandria DeWitt (Countess Vaughn) became the Jenkins&#x27; house guest. Vaughn received her role after she appeared on &quot;Star Search&quot; and declared to host Ed McMahon that her favorite show was &quot;227&quot;. However, Alexandria left during Calvin&#x27;s graduation episode near the end of season four to reunite with her father, who, after completing his archaeological dig in the Amazon, had moved to London to catalogue his items.

After the fourth season, Jackée&#x27;s television pilot, titled &quot;Jackée&quot;, found Sandra moving to New York City and finding work at a spa. NBC aired the episode on May 11, 1989. The pilot was rejected, and Jackée left the show; however, she was a guest star in seven of the final season&#x27;s episodes.

In the show&#x27;s final season, Toukie Smith, Barry Sobel, Stoney Jackson, Kevin Peter Hall, and Paul Winfield joined the cast in an effort to stop the show&#x27;s declining ratings. In the end, the cast additions proved fruitless and &quot;227&quot; ended its run in the spring of 1990.

==Cast==
Pearl Shay was the only character to appear in all 116 episodes of the show, appearing in the backdoor pilot &quot;Jackée&quot; as a guest star. Mary Jenkins, Lester Jenkins, and Rose Lee Holloway were absent in the &quot;Jackée&quot; pilot.

==Episodes==

==Ratings==
With the exception of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;227&quot; achieved higher ratings than other sitcoms airing at the time with a predominantly African-American cast during the first two seasons of its original run on NBC.

<text>A shtadlan (, ; , ) was an intercessor for a local European Jewish community. They represented the interests of the community, especially those of a town&#x27;s ghetto, and worked as a &quot;lobbyist&quot; negotiating with the authorities holding power for the safety and benefit of Jews. The process of Jewish intercession is known as &quot;shtadlanut&quot; ().

Shtadlanim (plural of shtadlan) relied on many tactics to intercede on the behalf of the Jewish community. These included emotional appeals, such as begging, rational appeals such as trying to implement charters or decrees, and also gifts of money or other goods to gain favor. Elyakim Zelig from Jampol, reported specifically on the need to beg for the Pope’s favor during a mission to Rome in 1757, in which he tried to gain support for defending Jews against blood libel.

Typically, a Jewish community (&quot;qahal&quot;) governed its own internal affairs. The interactions with the outside society, such as tax collection and enforcement of various restrictions and compulsions imposed on the community, were arranged by an internal governing board.

The &quot;shtadlan&quot; emerged to prominence in 17th century Europe, with the rise of absolutism, as an intermediary between the resident Jewish community and the monarchical government in control of the region. The position was appointed by the government, and could even be named as a royal official. Although he officially represented the Jewish community only, the &quot;shtadlan&quot; became a tool of the government.

Shtadlan played a significant role in the Jewish community, especially in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. One prominent shtadlan was Barukh ben David Yavan, born in the early 1700s. Yavan was instrumental in many secret missions between the king of Poland, Augustus III and Frederick II of Prussia, helping to end the War of the Austrian Succession. Yavan was also in contact with a papal nuncio in Warsaw allowing him to save many Talmuds after the Kamieniec disputation that led to most Talmuds being burned. Jacob Teitel, born in 1851 under czarist Russian rule, is another example of an influential shtadlan. After a pogrom began in the city of Saratov, he used his connection to the regional governor to stop the anti-Jewish actions.

During the late 19th century, the use of the press and public opinion as leverage for &quot;shtadlanus&quot; activity became the most important change in the work of the shadlan, becoming closely associated with relief efforts for victims of pogroms in Russia as well as the early foundings of Political Zionism.

Traditionally, &quot;shtadlanim&quot; were seen as great protectors of Jewish communities, and received from the communities&#x27; governing Jewish religious authorities.

<doc id="548423" wikidata="Q214278" url="?curid=548423" title="Common minnow">
<text>The Eurasian minnow, minnow, or common minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) is a small species of freshwater fish in the carp
family Cyprinidae. It is the type species of genus &quot;Phoxinus&quot;. It is ubiquitous throughout much of Eurasia, from Britain and Spain to eastern Siberia, predominantly in cool () streams and well-oxygenated lakes and ponds. It is noted for being a gregarious species, shoaling in large numbers.

==Description==
The common minnow is a small fish which reaches a maximum total length of , but is normally around in length. It has 3 spines and 6–8 soft rays in its dorsal fin with 3 spines and 6–8 soft rays in its anal fin. Its spine is made up of 38–40 vertebrae. It is distinguished from similar species which occur in Europe by having the lateral line normally extending beyond the nase of the anal fin, by a line of vertically elongated blotches along the lateral line each with a depth equivalent to 1/3–1/2 of the body&#x27;s depth at same position, these blotches often fuse to form a midlateral stripe, caudal peduncle has a depth of 2.6–3.1 times its length. The scales on the breast are patchy and the patches of scales are separated by unscaled areas although they are rarely connected by 1–2 rows of scales. Its snout length is 29–34% of the head length and is 1.1–1.4 times the diameter of the eye. The anal fin has its origin in front of the base of the last dorsal ray. The caudal fin consists of 19 soft rays. The back is normally brownish-green, and is separated from the whitish-gray underside by the lateral stripe or blotches described above,

==Distribution==
The common minnow is found in northern Eurasia from Ireland in the west and in the east to the Amur drainage and Korea. In Great Britain occurs to 58 °N and in Scandinavia and Russia occur up to the northernmost extremities. In western Europe the southern limit appears to be the Garonne and the upper Rhone. It has been recorded in the drainages of the Volga and the Ural, as well as in Lake Balkhash and the upper Syr-Darya drainage. Records elsewhere require confirmation as this species is similar to a number of others. In Scotland it is regarded as an introduced non native species, and this is probably the case in Ireland. Introductions are likely to have occurred elsewhere, including Norway.

==Habitat==
The common minnow is found in a wide variety of environments that have cold, well oxygenated water, often in syntopy with salmonids. These include small streams with fast currents, and, in the more northerly parts of its range, large lowland rivers. It also lives in still waters as varied as small mountain lakes to large, oligotrophic lakes. For spawning, it requires clean gravel areas in well oxygenated flowing water or where waves wash on lake shores. It also needs deep pools with low current to overwinter in, and these must have a coarse substrate among which the fish can hide.

==Behavior==
===Shoaling===
Shoaling and schooling behavior of common minnows occur early in their development, as soon as they become capable of swimming. Shoaling behavior then increases and becomes dominant by three to four weeks after its emergence. This behavior generally benefits individual minnows by improving predator avoidance and foraging. However, there are also costs of living in groups such as increased competition for food and risk of infection. Shoaling behavior is modified depending on the situation such as presence of predators or resource availability.

===Predator avoidance===
The group formation of common minnows can be explained by the selfish herd effect proposed by W.D. Hamilton. According to the selfish herd theory, a group forms as individuals try to reduce their domain of danger by approaching others and continuously moving toward the center of the group where the risk of predation is the lowest. As the theory predicts, common minnows increase their shoaling behavior in response to increased predation pressure.

====Alarm substance====
Common minnows can detect the predators’ presence and communicate with their shoalmates by a chemical signal that is detected by olfactory nerves. The chemical, named Schreckstoff after a German word meaning &quot;fear substance&quot; by Karl von Frisch who first described it, is contained in specialized skin cells called alarm substance cells and is released from an injured or killed minnow. The shoalmates can detect the chemical and respond to the increased risk of predation.

The production and release of this alarm substance are altruistic because the sender of the signal, who does not directly benefit from the signal released upon its injury, has to pay the cost for the production and release of the chemical. In fact, the alarm substance cells decrease in number when the common minnows are in poor physical condition due to scarce food, indicating that there is metabolic cost for producing and maintaining the specialized cells. The apparent altruistic behavior is not clearly understood, because the likely explanation of kin selection is not supported by the shoal structure of common minnows in which shoalmates are not necessarily closely related.

====Shoaling adjustment in response to predation risk====
When common minnows sense the alarm substance, they form tighter shoals as individuals move to be in the central position in their shoaling group. However, in an experiment where common minnows were habituated to the chemical by continuous exposure, common minnows did not react to the signal. Only the naïve common minnows reacted to the signal by relocating themselves to the central position in the group. In another experiment, researchers observed common minnows in semi-natural setting and found that common minnows’ shoaling behavior varies depending on the habitat&#x27;s complexity. Minnows tend to respond to increased predation risk by forming larger shoals in structurally simple habitats and by reducing their rate of movement in complex habitats.

====Predator inspection====
When potential predators come near the shoal, some common minnows take the risk of approaching the predators in order to inspect the predator and assess the danger. Predator inspection behavior increases the risk of being attacked and eaten by the predator, but the behavior is beneficial to the inspectors as more alert minnows react more quickly to the attack of the predator. Common minnows are expected to recognize predators by their appearance. In an experiment, common minnows inspected a realistic-looking model of a pike, one of the major predators of minnows, and a simple cylinder model. Common minnows showed high level of alertness, such as low feeding rate and frequent skittering after their visit to the realistic model, but they became easily habituated to the simple model and resumed foraging even in proximity to the model.

In addition to identifying predators by their appearance, common minnows can respond to the predators’ motivation to attack. In an experiment, common minnows inspected a northern pike behind a clear partition at regular intervals until the pike tried to attack the minnows. Their responses differed depending on when their visit was made. Minnows that inspected the pike just before the pike attacked were more alarmed than those who inspected the pike long before the attack. The observation shows that common minnows can detect the predator&#x27;s impending aggressiveness and motivation to attack.

====Variations in anti-predator activities====
Different populations of common minnows show varying degrees of anti-predatory activities. Common minnows from populations in high-predation areas usually show more intense predator inspection than those from low-predation areas. They tend to commence inspection sooner, form larger group of inspectors, inspect more frequently, and approach less to the predator.

Some components of anti-predator activities are inherited, as indicated in the early emergence of shoaling behavior in laboratory-raised immature minnows. The varying levels of predator inspection and shoaling behavior in response to predator&#x27;s presence can arise in laboratory-raised minnows even though they do not have any experience of predators. Their anti-predatory behaviors are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to their wild-caught counterparts. Anti-predatory behaviors are modified by early experience of predators. Early exposure to predators increases the inspection rate and shoaling tendency.

===Foraging===
Shoaling behavior improves foraging success, because the demand for anti-predatory activities per individual is reduced and because more individuals scanning for food leads to quicker detection. In general, a larger shoal of fish locates food faster, which was confirmed to be true in common minnows.

====Individual recognition and shoal choice====
Common minnows do not randomly choose shoalmates to forage with. They tend to associate with familiar shoalmates and prefer to form shoals with poor competitors for food, which indicates that they can recognize individual conspecifics. It is more beneficial to shoal with poor competitors because while group foraging helps the search for food, it also leads to competition for food among the shoalmates.
Common minnows tend to associate with familiar shoalmates, but new alliances can form when different groups encounter. In an experiment in which common minnows from different groups were introduced to a common environment and monitored, they associated significantly more frequently with familiar individuals than unfamiliar individuals. The preference lasted up to two weeks, but by the third week, new association patterns were observed.

==Breeding in captivity==
The Eurasian minnow breeds well in cold fresh water aquariums, but it is rarely sold as an aquarium fish. They need a good supply of oxygen (some air bubblers do fine), a reasonable current (which is often provided by the bubblers if they are good strong ones), and a gravel bottom. It is not clear what size works best although smallish ( each) works well. Clean water helps and so do plant life and general good quality aquarium conditions. Breeding begins around late May when the fish become noticeably more active, and the fish begin to change colour. The females don&#x27;t change their colour so much, more the shape of their body; in fact the colours seem to fade if anything except for the fins which become slightly more red. Their body becomes more deep set toward the abdomen, which area also starts bulking out. Although the changes in the female are small, the changes in the male are huge. First of all, the difference in the shades of colour on the fish become stronger (dark gets darker, light gets lighter), and the fins, throat and some other areas redden. These colour changes strengthen as the fish gets closer to breeding. The body becomes much bulkier, and the gills become very pale with iridescent light blue patches towards the bottom and below. This contrasts with the now very dark body. Later the scales on the lower half of the body begin to stand out more and become slightly gold-lined. All these strengthen as time passes on. All the fins, especially the dorsal, start to stick out more; this happens in both sexes. The males begin to chase females around, rubbing their sides against them, and this becomes very frenzied and aggressive towards the mating. Mating happens when this behaviour reaches its climax where the female releases the eggs and the male fertilizes them.

Fertilised eggs promptly sink to the bottom and into the gravel. The other fish will start eating the eggs and picking at the gravel to find them. The male will then ferociously guard them for a period of time. A few days later the eggs will hatch and the fry will emerge. It is very important to have much plant cover for the fry to hide in as the adult fish will try to eat them especially if underfed and if not much other live food is given. The baby fry feed on small organisms called infusoria and algae. To grow infusoria for feeding just get a jam jar of pond water and run it through some cotton wool or muslin to get out any larger predatory organisms like daphnia which will eat the infusoria and add hay to the water. Leave it for a few days in a dimly lit room at about room temp. There will be many tiny white dots in the water which, if looked at under a microscope reveal to be many types of infusoria in their millions. These can be fed to the fry by adding them to the tank. To get more just add some of the old water containing the infusoria to cooled, boiled tap water with hay and repeat the other procedures. As the fry grow their diet changes. When they reach about they can be fed small organisms like daphnia or cyclops. These can be obtained by dragging a net through water where they can be seen or they can be purchased from aquarium dealers. Soon the fish will eat the same food as the adults and will quickly grow.

==Endocrinology==
Skin color changes are controlled by photoreceptors deep in the brain. This has contributed greatly to understanding of photoactivation of various processes across vertebrates - including for example, seasonality.

<text>A format war is a competition between similar but mutually incompatible technical standards that compete for the same market, such as for data storage devices and recording formats for electronic media. It is often characterized by political and financial influence on content publishers by the developers of the technologies. Developing companies may be characterized as engaging in a format war if they actively oppose or avoid interoperable open-industry technical standards in favor of their own.

A format war emergence can be explained because each vendor is trying to exploit cross-side network effects in a two-sided market. There is also a social force to stop a format war: when one of them wins as &quot;de facto&quot; standard, it solves a coordination problem for the format users.

==19th century==
*Rail gauge. The Gauge War in Britain pitted the Great Western Railway, which used broad gauge, against other rail companies, which used what would come to be known as standard gauge. Ultimately standard gauge prevailed. 
*Similarly, in the United States there was incompatibility between railroads built to the standard gauge and those built to the so-called Russian gauge. During the initial period of railroad building, standard gauge was adopted in most of the northeastern United States, while the wider gauge, later called &quot;Russian&quot;, was preferred in most of the southern states. In 1886, the southern railroads agreed to coordinate changing gauge on all their tracks. By June 1886, all major railroads in North America were using what was effectively the same gauge.
*Direct current vs. alternating current: The 1880s saw the spread of electric lighting with large utilities and manufacturing companies supplying it. The systems initially ran on direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) with low voltage DC used for interior lighting and high voltage DC and AC running very bright exterior arc lighting. With the invention of the AC transformer in the mid 1880s, alternating current could be stepped up in voltage for long range transmission and stepped down again for domestic use, making it a much more efficient transmission standard now directly competing with DC for the indoor lighting market. In the U.S. Thomas Edison&#x27;s Edison Electric Light Company tried to protect its patent controlled DC market by playing on the public&#x27;s fears of the dangers of high voltage AC, portraying their main AC competitor, George Westinghouse&#x27;s Westinghouse Electric Company, as purveyors of an unsafe system, a back and forth financial and propaganda competition that came to be known as the war of the currents, even promoting AC for the Electric chair execution device. AC, with its more economic transmission would prevail, supplanting DC.
*Musical boxes: Several manufacturers introduced musical boxes that utilised interchangeable steel disks that carried the tune. The principal players were Polyphon, Symphonion (in Europe) and Regina (in the United States). Each manufacturer used its own unique set of disc sizes (which varied depending on the exact model purchased). This assured that once the purchaser had bought a music box, they had to buy the music discs from the same manufacturer.

==1900s==
*Player pianos: In stark contrast to almost every other entertainment medium of the 20th century and beyond, a looming format war involving paper roll music for player pianos was averted when industry leaders agreed upon a common format at the Buffalo Convention held in Buffalo, New York in 1908. The agreed-upon format was a roll wide. This allowed any roll of music to be played in any player piano, regardless of who manufactured it. As the music played, the paper winds onto the lower roll from the upper roll, which means any text or song lyrics printed on the rolls is read from the bottom to the top.

==1910s==
*Early recording media formats: cylinder records versus disc records. In 1877 Thomas Edison invented sound recording and reproduction using tinfoil wrapped around a pre-grooved cylinder, and in 1888 he introduced the wax &quot;Edison cylinder&quot; as the standard record format. In the 1890s Emile Berliner began marketing disc records and players. By the late 1890s cylinders and discs were in competition. Cylinders were more expensive to manufacture and the wax was fragile, but most cylinder players could make recordings. Discs saved space and were cheaper and sturdier, but due to the constant angular velocity (CAV) of their rotation, the sound quality varied noticeably from the groove near the outer edge to the inner portion nearest the center; and disc record players could not make recordings.

==1920s==
*Gramophone record formats: lateral versus vertical &quot;hill-and-dale&quot; groove cutting. When Edison introduced his &quot;Diamond Disc&quot; (played with a diamond stylus instead of a steel needle) record in 1912, it was cut &quot;hill-and-dale&quot;, meaning that the groove was modulated along its vertical axis, as it had been on all cylinders—unlike other manufacturers&#x27; discs, which were cut laterally, meaning that their grooves were of constant depth and modulated along the horizontal axis. Machines designed to play lateral-cut discs could not play vertical-cut ones and vice versa. Pathé Records also adopted the hill-and-dale format for their discs, first issued in 1906, but they used a very wide, shallow groove, played with a small sapphire ball, which was incompatible with Edison products. In 1929 Thomas Edison quit the record industry, ceasing all production of both discs and cylinders. Pathé had been making a transition to the lateral format during the 1920s and in 1932 decisively abandoned the vertical format. There was no standard speed for all disc records until 78 rpm was settled on during the latter half of the 1920s, although because most turntables could be adjusted to run at a fairly wide range of speeds that did not really constitute a format war. Some Berliner Gramophone discs played at about 60 rpm. Some of Pathé&#x27;s largest discs, which were 50 cm (nearly 20 inches) in diameter, played at 120 rpm. Diamond Discs were 80 rpm. Those makers aside, speeds in the mid-70s were more usual.

:In addition, there were several more minor &quot;format wars&quot; between the various brands using various speeds ranging from 72 to 96 rpm, as well as needle or stylus radii varying from the current radius needle or stylus is a compromise as no company actually used this size. The most common sizes were , used by Columbia, and , used by HMV/Victor.

==1930s==
*240-line versus 405-line television broadcasts. In 1936, the BBC Television Service commenced television broadcasting from Alexandra Palace in North London. They began by using two different television standards broadcasting in alternate weeks. The 240-line Baird sequential system was broadcast using a mechanical scanning apparatus. In the intervening weeks, EMI-Marconi broadcast in 405-line interlaced using fully electronic cameras. Early sets had to support both systems, adding to their complexity. It was the BBC&#x27;s intention to run the two systems side by side for a six-month trial to determine which would be finally adopted. The BBC quickly discovered that the fully electronic EMI system had a superior picture quality and less flicker, and the camera equipment was much more mobile and transportable (Baird&#x27;s intermediate-film cameras had to be bolted to the studio floor as they required a water supply and drainage). The trial concluded after only three months after Baird&#x27;s studios had lost most of their equipment in a fire.

==1940s==
*Vinyl records: Columbia Records&#x27; Long Play (LP) 33⅓ rpm &quot;microgroove&quot; record (introduced in 1948) versus RCA Victor&#x27;s 45 rpm record, from 1949 (the introduction of the latter) into c. 1951. The battle ended because each format found a separate marketing niche (LP for classical music recordings, 45 for the pop &quot;singles&quot; market) and most new record players were capable of playing both types.
* The National Television System Committee (NTSC) was formed to settle the existing format incompatibility between the original 441 scan line RCA system and systems designed by the DuMont Television Network and Philco. In March 1941 the committee issued its plan for what is now known as NTSC, which has been the standard for television signals in the United States and most countries influenced by the U.S. until the adoption of digital and HD television formats with the official adoption of ATSC on June 12, 2009.

==1950s==
* The National Television System Committee (NTSC) was reconvened in January 1950 to decide the revision to their original format to allow for color broadcasting. There were competitive format options offered by the Columbia Broadcasting System that were not downwardly compatible with the existing NTSC format.
* In the early 1950s, 12 volt electric systems were introduced to automobiles in an effort to provide more starting power for big engines which were getting popular at the time; while reducing the current. Six volt systems were still popular since they were commonplace prior to the decade. However, 12 volt systems became the de facto standard.

==1960s==
*Portable audio formats: 8-track and four-track cartridges vs. Compact Cassette, vs the lesser known DC-International tape cassette (introduced by Grundig). While rather successful into the mid-to-late 1970s, the 8-track eventually lost out due to technical limitations, including variable audio quality and inability to be rewound. Similarly the smaller formats of microcassette, developed by Olympus, and minicassette, developed by Sony, were manufactured for applications requiring lower audio fidelity such as dictation and telephone answering machines.
*FM radio stereo broadcast formats: The Crosby system and the GE/Zenith system. The Crosby system was technically superior, especially in transmitting clear stereo signals, due to its use of an FM subcarrier for stereo sound rather than the AM subcarrier employed by GE/Zenith. Many radios built in this period allowed the user to select Crosby or GE/Zenith listening modes. However the Crosby system was incompatible with the more lucrative SCA services such as in-store broadcasting and background music. FM station owners successfully lobbied the FCC to adopt the GE/Zenith system in 1961, which was SCA-compatible.

==1970s==

*Various Quadraphonic encoding methods: CD-4, SQ, QS-Matrix, and others. The expense (and speaker placement troubles) of quadraphonic, coupled with the competing formats requiring various demodulators and decoders, led to an early demise of quadraphonic, though 8-track tape experienced a temporary boost from the introduction of the Q8 form of 8-track cartridge. Quadraphonic sound returned in the 1990s substantially updated as surround sound, but incompatible with old hardware.
*JVC VHS vs. Sony Betamax vs. Philips Video 2000, the analog video videotape format war. The competition started in 1976 and by 1980, VHS controlled 70% of the North American market. VHS&#x27;s main advantage was its longer recording time. From the consumer perspective, VHS blank media held more hours and therefore was less expensive.
*The first small format video recording devices were open reel-to-reel 1/2&quot; &quot;portable&quot; EIAJ-1 recorders, most of which came with television tuners to record TV broadcasts. These never caught on in the consumer market but did find their way into educational television and were the mainstays of early public-access television stations. The uniformity of the EIAJ-1 format was the result of a developmental format war between Sony and Panasonic, each of whom were aiming at this market. The existence of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) was the Japanese electronics industry&#x27;s answer to some potential format wars.
*Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED) vs. LaserDisc (LD) vs. VHD (Video High-Density), non-recordable video disc formats. All of these ultimately failed to achieve widespread acceptance, although LD found a considerable videophile niche market that appreciated its high quality image, chapter select and widescreen presentation. The LaserDisc remained available until the arrival of the DVD. Mainstream consumers preferred the recordable videotape for capturing broadcast television and making home movies, and made VHS the de facto standard video format for almost 20 years (circa 1982 to 2002).

==1980s==
*Home computers often had incompatible peripherals such as joysticks, printers, or data recording (tape or disk). For example, if a Commodore 64 user wanted a printer, they would need to buy a Commodore-compatible unit, or else risk not being able to plug the printer into their computer. Similarly, disk formats were not interchangeable without third party software since each manufacturer (Atari, IBM, Apple, et al.) used their own proprietary format. Gradually computer and game systems standardized on the Atari joystick port for joysticks and mice (during the 1980s), parallel port for printers (mid-1980s), the MS-DOS-derived FAT12 format for floppy disks (mid-1990s), and so on.
*AM stereo was capable of fidelity equivalent to FM but was doomed in the United States by competing formats during the 1980s with Motorola&#x27;s C-QUAM competing vigorously with three other incompatible formats including those by Magnavox, Kahn/Hazeltine, and Harris. It is still widely used in Japan, and sees sporadic use by broadcast stations in the United States despite the lack of consumer equipment to support it.
*Video8 vs. VHS-C and later Hi8 vs. S-VHS-C tape formats (see camcorder). This is an extension of the VHS vs. Betamax format war, but here neither format &quot;won&quot; widespread acceptance. Video8 had the advantage in terms of recording time (4 hours versus 2 hours maximum), but consumers also liked VHS-C since it could easily play in their home VCRs, thus the two formats essentially split the camcorder market in half. Both formats were superseded by digital systems by 2011.
*Several different versions of the Quarter Inch Cartridge used for data backup.
*Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) vs. Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA). Up to the introduction of MCA, personal computers had relied on a 16 bit expansion system which was later christened &#x27;Industry Standard Architecture&#x27; (ISA). IBM introduced a new range of personal computers featuring a new 32 bit expansion system which they called MCA. It was at this point that the rest of the personal computer industry named the existing expansion system as ISA. IBM wanted substantial royalties from any manufacturer wishing to adopt the MCA system (largely in an attempt to recover lost royalties that they believed that they were owed due to the wholesale cloning of their original &#x27;PC&#x27;, a task that was greatly simplified by the &#x27;off the shelf&#x27; nature of the design). IBM&#x27;s competitors jointly responded by introducing the EISA expansion system which, unlike MCA, was fully compatible with the existing ISA cards. Eventually, neither MCA nor EISA really caught on, and the PCI standard was adopted instead.
* Home computer sound cards: Ad Lib vs. Roland MT-32 vs. Sound Blaster

==1990s==
*Philips&#x27; Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) vs. Sony&#x27;s MiniDisc (MD): both introduced in 1992. Since affordable CD-R was not available until about 1996, DCC and MD were an attempt to bring CD-quality recording to the home consumer. Restrictions by record companies fearful of perfect digital copies had limited an earlier digital system (DAT) to professional use. In response, Sony introduced the MiniDisc format which provided a copy control system that seemed to allay record companies&#x27; fears. Philips introduced their DCC system around the same time using the same copy control system. Philips&#x27; DCC was discontinued in 1996 but MD successfully captured the Asia Pacific market (e.g. Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.) and initially did well in parts of Europe. The consumers in other parts of the world chose neither format, preferring to stick with analog Compact Cassettes for home audio recording, and eventually upgrading to now affordable CD recordable discs and lossy-compressed MP3 formats. Production of MiniDisc systems finally ceased in 2013, however Sony continues to produce blank discs in Japan until February 2025.
*Rockwell X2 vs K56flex – In the race to achieve faster telephone line modem speeds from the then-standard 9.6 kbit/s, many companies developed proprietary formats such as V.32 Turbo (19.2 kbit/s) or TurboPEP (23.0 kbit/s) or V.FAST (28.8 kbit/s), hoping to gain an edge on the competition. The X2 and K56flex formats were a continuation of that ongoing battle for market dominance until the V.90 standard was developed in 1999. For some time, online providers needed to maintain two modem banks to provide dial-up access for both technologies. (See &quot;modem&quot; for a complete history.)
*Medium-capacity removable magnetic media drives, with several incompatible formatsa small market of write-once optical drives (requiring the use of a protective, plastic jacket) and several more successful but also incompatible magnetic read-write cassette drives. The Iomega Zip format ultimately prevailed, with capacities of 100 and 250 megabytes, plus the rather less popular 750 MB system; but these media and their drives were quickly supplanted by the much slower but far cheaper recordable compact disc CD-R (early models use a caddy to ensure proper alignment and help protect the disc). The CD-R has the advantage of existing wide industry standards support (the &quot;Red Book&quot; CD-DA standard for audio discs and the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; CD-ROM standard for data read-only CD), with the low-level recording format based upon the popular and low-cost read-only compact disc used for audio and data. Sony tried to establish &quot;MD Data&quot; Discs as an alternative, based on their MiniDisc R&amp;D, with two computer peripherals: MDH-10 and MDM-111.
*External bus transfer protocols: IEEE 1394 (FireWire) vs. USB. The proliferation of both standards has led to the inclusion of redundant hardware adapters in many computers, unnecessary versioning of external hardware, etc. FireWire has been marginalized to high-throughput media devices (such as high-definition videocamera equipment) and legacy hardware.
*3D graphics APIs: DirectX vs. OpenGL vs. Glide API. In the latter half of the 1990s, as 3D graphics became more common and popular, several video formats were promoted by different vendors. The proliferation of standards (each having many versions with frequent and significant changes) led to great complexity, redundancy, and frustrating hardware and software compatibility issues. 3D graphics applications (such as games) attempted to support a variety of APIs with varying results, or simply supported only a single API. Moreover, the complexity of the emerging graphics pipeline (display adapter -&gt; display adapter driver -&gt; 3D graphics API -&gt; application) led to a great number of incompatibilities, leading to unstable, underperforming, or simply inoperative software. Glide eventually dropped out of the war due to the only manufacturer supporting it — that is, 3dfx — ceasing production of their video cards.
*Video disc formats: MMCD versus SD. In the early 1990s two high-density optical storage standards were being developed: one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips and Sony, and the other was the Super Density disc (SD), supported by Toshiba, Matsushita and many others. MMCD was optionally double-layer while SD was optionally double-sided. Movie studio support was split. This format war was settled before either went to market, by unifying the two formats. Following pressure by IBM, Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed upon the SD format with one modification based on MMCD technology, viz. EFMPlus. The unified disc format, which included both dual-layer and double-sided options, was called DVD and was introduced in Japan in 1996 and in the rest of the world in 1997.
*More video disc formats: Video CD versus the DVD. While the MMCD and SD war was going on, Philips developed their own video format called the Video CD. While the format quickly flopped in the U.S., in Europe and Japan the battle waged on fiercely, as the VideoCD&#x27;s lower production cost (and thus sales price) versus the DVD&#x27;s superior audiovisual quality and multimedia experience resulted in a split market audience, with one end wanting cheap media without minding the lower quality and multimedia richness, while the other willing to pay a premium for the better experience DVD offered. The battle was settled by the movie industry who rapidly refused to issue any more VCD discs once CD recorders became available. Unlike DVD, the VCD format had no copy protection mechanism whatsoever.
*Digital video formats: DVD versus DIVX (not to be confused with DivX). DIVX was a rental scheme where the end consumer would purchase a $2–3 disc similar to DVD but could only view the disc for 48 hours after the first use, similar to another rental scheme, Flexplay. Each subsequent view would require a phoneline connection to purchase another $2–3 rental period. Several Hollywood studios (Disney, 20th Century-Fox, and Paramount Pictures) initially released their movies exclusively in the DIVX format. However, video rental services found the multi-use DVD more attractive, and videophiles who collected films rejected the idea of a pay-per-view disc.

*Memory cards, with several implementations: CompactFlash vs. Memory Stick vs. MultiMediaCard (MMC) vs. Secure Digital card (SD) vs. SmartMedia vs. Miniature Card. The format war became even more confusing with introduction of xD-Picture Card, XQD card and CFast in the next decade. This ongoing contest is complicated by the existence of multiple variants of the various formats. Some of these, such as miniSD / microSD, are compatible with their parent formats, while later Memory Sticks break compatibility with the original format. After SD was introduced in 1999, it eventually won the war in the early 2000s decade when companies that had exclusively supported other formats in the past, such as Fujifilm, Olympus and Sony, began to use SD card in their products. The CF slots continued to be favoured for high-end cameras, but there are adapters for SD cards to be used in them.
*Hi-fi digital audio discs: DVD-Audio versus SACD. These discs offered all the advantages of a CD but with higher audio quality. The players and discs were reverse compatible (the new Hi-fi players could play most 12 cm optical disc formats) but listening to the newer formats require a hardware upgrade. SACD was acclaimed by Sony marketeers as offering slightly better technical quality through its new PDM &quot;bitstream&quot; system and a greater number of SACD titles available. However, the two formats continue to coexist due to &quot;hybrid&quot; players that play both formats with equal ease. Neither DVD-Audio nor SACD won a significant percentage of the recorded audio market. A significant reason was the customer preference for easy-to-transport lossy compressed formats such as MP3 and AAC. In 2013, music companies led by Universal Music Group have launched Blu-ray Discs with high-resolution PCM audio, branded as High Fidelity Pure Audio, as an alternative format with the same objectives.
*Television auxiliary video inputs: Composite video vs. S-video. Composite video inputs had more widespread support since they used the ubiquitous RCA connector previously used only with audio devices, but S-video used a 4-pin DIN connector exclusively for the video bus.
* Wireless communication standards: Through the late 1990s, proponents of Bluetooth (such as Sony-Ericsson) and WiFi competed to gain support for positioning one of these standards as the de facto computer-to-computer wireless communication protocol. This competition ended around 2000 with WiFi the undisputed winner (largely due to a very slow rollout of Bluetooth networking products). However, in the early 2000s, Bluetooth was repurposed as a device-to-computer wireless communication standard, and has succeeded well in this regard. Today&#x27;s computers often feature separate equipment for both types of wireless communication, and both are ubiquitous in modern smartphones.
*Disk image formats for capturing digital versions of removable computer media (particularly CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs): ISO vs. CUE/BIN vs. NRG vs. MDS vs. DAA, etc. Although the details of capturing images are complex (e.g., the oddities of various copy protection technologies applied to removable media), image formats have proliferated beyond reason - mainly because producers of image-creating software often like to create a new format with touted properties in order to bolster market share.
*Streaming media formats: AVI, QuickTime (MOV), Windows Media (WMV), RealMedia (RA), Liquid Audio, MPEG, DivX, XviD, and a large host of other streaming media formats cropped up, particularly during the internet boom of the late 1990s. The wildly large number of formats is very redundant and leads to a large number of software and hardware incompatibilities (e.g., a large number of competing rendering pipelines are typically implemented in web browsers and portable video players.)
*Single-serve coffee containers: Major players include Nestlé’s Nespresso which started in 1976, but became popular in the late 1990s and was later joined by Senseo, Caffitaly, Keurig and Tassimo. These systems were created to give out a single serving of fresh ground coffee through a capsule. By the end of the 2010s, as the patents on the original systems expired, allowing rival companies to make cheaper capsules, Nespresso came out on top in most of the world, but Keurig dominated the North American market.

==2000s==

* Recordable DVD formats: DVD+R versus DVD-R and DVD-RAM. DVD-RAM has largely relegated to a niche market, but both of the other recordable DVD formats remain available. Since practically all PC based DVD drives and most new DVD recorders support both formats (designated as DVD±R recorders), the &#x27;war&#x27; is effectively moot.
*Digital audio data compression formats: MP3 versus Ogg Vorbis versus MPEG4 Advanced Audio Coding versus HE-AAC/AACplus versus Windows Media Audio codecs versus Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC). Each format has found its own niche — MPEG1 audio layer 3, abbreviated MP3, was developed for audio encoding of the DVD and has remained a de facto standard for audio encoding. A technically better compression technique, MPEG4 (more commonly known as AAC) was subsequently developed and found favor with most commercial music distributors. The addition of Spectral Band Replication (AACplus or HE-AAC) allows the format to recreate high-frequency components/harmonics missing from other compressed music. Vorbis is most commonly used by game developers who have need for a high-quality audio, do not want to pay the licensing fees attached to other codecs, and did not need existing compatibility and name-recognition of MP3. Flac, a lossless format, emerged later and has become accepted by audiophiles. Consumer outcry against software incompatibility has prompted portable music player manufacturers such as Apple and Creative to support multiple formats.
*High-definition optical disc formats: Blu-ray Disc versus HD DVD. Several disc formats that were intended to improve on the performance of the DVD were developed, including Sony&#x27;s Blu-ray and Toshiba&#x27;s HD DVD, as well as HVD, FVD and VMD. The first HD-DVD player was released in March 2006, followed quickly by a Blu-ray player in June 2006. In addition to the home video standalone players for each format, Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 video game console offers a Blu-ray Disc player and its games use that format as well. The format war went largely in Blu-ray&#x27;s favor after the largest movie studio supporting HD DVD, Warner Bros., decided to abandon releasing films on HD-DVD in January 2008. In 2008, Toshiba decided to abandon the format too. Shortly thereafter, several major North American rental services and retailers such as Netflix, Best Buy, Walmart, etc. and disc manufacturers such as CMC Magnetics, Ritek, Anwell, and others, announced the exclusive support for Blu-ray products, ending the format war.
*Ultra-wideband networking technology — in early 2006, an IEEE standards working group disbanded because two factions could not agree on a single standard for a successor to Wi-Fi. (WiMedia Alliance, IEEE 802.15, WirelessHD)
*Automotive interfaces for charging mobile devices: cigar lighter receptacles delivered 12 volts DC and USB 5 volts. The 5-volt system derived from PC data buses, while the 12 volt system derived from the automobile&#x27;s electrical system. The popularity of cigar-lighter-to-USB adapters for charging cell phones is what led to this movement, and later automobiles were equipped with both (sometimes with USB on the car radio faceplate).

==2010s==
* Digital video: H.264 and H.265 (patented standards that require royalty payments) versus royalty-free alternatives like VP8, VP9, and Theora that attempt to avoid patent infringement.
* 4G wireless broadband WiMAX versus LTE Advanced.
* Power-line communication as an alternative to Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet for broadband home networking (LAN) purposes: IEEE 1901, branded as HomePlug AV/AV2 and commercially marketed by networking hardware brands such as Devolo, D-Link, TP-Link and Zyxel, vs. the more recent, but similar ITU standard G.hn promoted by some major ISPs and hardware manufacturers part of the HomeGrid Forum trade association.
* Premium Large Format (PLF) cinema: IMAX versus Dolby Cinema versus Barco Escape versus China Film Giant Screen versus RPX versus Extra Experience versus UltraAVX.
* Virtual reality headsets: Oculus Rift using Oculus&#x27; OVR API vs. HTC Vive&#x27;s SteamVR
* Universal charger: USB is an industry standard that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics. USB-C has become a widespread standard for charging mobile phones.
* Wireless charging standard: Qi from Wireless Power Consortium versus WiPower from The Alliance for Wireless Power
* Web browser plugin API: NPAPI versus PPAPI, championed by Google, which announced it was dropping NPAPI support from Chrome on September 1, 2015.
*Combined Charging System (Europe, Americas, South Korea) versus CHAdeMO (Japanese standard) versus North American Charging Standard (NACS) (Tesla) quick charging methods for battery electric vehicles.
* The ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020 had defined 10 bit for each color channel for the future 8K UHDTV in 2012. Dolby developed an extension for Dolby Cinema in 2014 where the new Dolby Vision format has a 12 bit color depth per channel. Dolby Vision is not royalty free so that Samsung developed an alternative HDR10+ format for HDR video in 2017. Its rival LG does support Dolby Vision. With widespread availability of HDR television during 2018 it can be seen that products supporting Dolby Vision do also allow HDR10+ as input.
* Modern surround sound standards (formats with object tracks): Dolby Atmos vs vs MPEG-H 3D Audio vs Auro-3D vs Sony 360 Reality Audio
* Digital radio standards: Digital mobile radio vs Project 25 vs TETRA, NXDN as well as some Amateur radio-only variants such as D-STAR and Yaesu System Fusion
