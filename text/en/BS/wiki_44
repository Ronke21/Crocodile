<text>The sirkeer malkoha or sirkeer cuckoo (Taccocua leschenaultii), is a non-parasitic cuckoo found in dry scrub forest and open woodland habitats in the Indian subcontinent. The species is long-tailed, largely olive brown on the upper side with a distinctive curved red beak tipped in yellow. They forage singly or in pairs mainly on or close to the ground creeping between grasses and bushes, often on rocky habitats where they feed on small lizards, insects, and sometimes berries and seeds. They are very silent and the sexes are identical in plumage.

==Description==
The sirkeer cuckoo is about long with dark olive brown on the back, wings and the central tail feathers. The underside is rufous. A greenish gloss is visible on the wing and dark parts of the tail feathers. The feathers have dark shafts which are especially prominent on the breast as streaks. The tail is graduated (with outer feathers being sequentially shorter) and tipped broadly in white. The upper tail coverts are long. The chin, throat and breast are pale. The most distinctive feature is the curved red bill with a yellow tip. The eyes have curved and long bristles around the eye but not behind it that resemble eyelashes (an adaptation to protect their eyes when creeping through grass and vegetation) and the iris is reddish brown. They have a short and pale whitish streak over and below the eye and a thin line of black feathers in line with the commissure of the bill that reaches under the eye. A dark bare patch of skin around the eye that tapers behind it exaggerates the size of the eye. The legs are grey.

They have zygodactyle feet and are forage on the ground, on rocks or between grass and bushes in scrub and thin forest, often in hilly ground but generally below an altitude of about 1500 m above sea level. They feed on caterpillars, insects and other invertebrates, small vertebrates, and on berries and seeds. When disturbed they creep through dense bushes and run on the ground almost appearing like a mongoose. Their flight is weak. They are normally very silent but produce a low buzzing &#x27;, or a sharp and repeated &#x27; or &quot;&quot; sounds with a tone similar to the calls of a rose-ringed parakeet. The primaries at the wing tip from the longest to the shortest are 7&gt;6&gt;5&gt;8&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1&gt;9&gt;10. The primary moult is from August to December while the second moult occurs in April.

The populations, &quot;P. l. sirkee&quot; in northwestern India (Rajasthan, Gujarat and Sind) are pale and have a yellowish throat and breast. The populations in the Eastern Himalayas are darker and larger and are considered to be a subspecies &quot;infuscata&quot; described by Edward Blyth (Latin scholars suggest it should be spelled &quot;infuscatus&quot; when used in the genus &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot;). The nominate subspecies is intermediate in coloration and is distributed across Peninsular India and extends into Sri Lanka. 

The species is placed in the genus &quot;Taccocua&quot; erected by Lesson in 1831 but some authors place it in the genus &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot;. The genus &quot;Taccocua&quot; was separated from that of &quot;Rhopodytes&quot; (usually merged into &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot;) by the bill being narrower at the base and the upper mandible being festooned at the base. The generic name is derived from the French word used for lizard cuckoos in the genus &quot;Coccyzus (&quot;earlier &quot;Saurothera)&quot; combined with the genus name &quot;Coua&quot; while the species epithet commemorates the French botanist Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour while the name &quot;sirkeer&quot; has been claimed by James Jobling to be from the local name used for the bird in Gujarat although Blanford noted that the supposed Indian names &quot;Surkool&quot; or &quot;Sircea&quot; of Latham were untraceable. One theory is that they were often found in areas with reeds called &quot;sirkanda&quot; (&quot;Saccharum&quot; sp., possibly &quot;S. bengalense&quot; Retz.) in northern India from which mats used as curtains known as (&quot;sirkean&quot; in plural) were manufactured. Across much of northern India, it is known locally as &quot;junglee tota&quot; meaning &#x27;jungle parrot&#x27; (or &#x27;parakeet&#x27;) based on the similarity of the bill to that of the locally familiar rose-ringed parakeet.

== Distribution ==

All of the sub-Himalayan Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka; patchily in Pakistan and Rajasthan. They are thought to have expanded into the Sind region in the 1930s following the construction of the Sukkur barrage and the extension of canal irrigation. Three subspecies have been designated, varying in colouration but showing continuous variation and having no disjunctions in their distribution ranges.

== Breeding ==
This cuckoo, like other malkohas, is non-parasitic. The breeding season varies from March to August. Their courtship display involves pairs bowing with the tail splayed wide, held upright and looking like an open fan. The plumage is puffed out and the bowing is followed by raising their head high and holding the bill upward for a few seconds. The bills are held open during the display and the pairs produce clicking sounds. The nest is a broad saucer of twigs placed in a low bush or tree and lined with green leaves. The clutch is two to three eggs which are pale yellowish brown with a glaze that is lost when washed. Both sexes incubate but the period is undocumented.

<text>Experian plc is a multinational data broker and consumer credit reporting company headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. Experian collects and aggregates information on over 1 billion people and businesses including 235 million individual U.S. consumers and more than 25 million U.S. businesses. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Experian is a partner in USPS address validation. It is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; credit-reporting agencies, alongside TransUnion and Equifax.

In addition to its credit services, Experian also sells decision analytic and marketing assistance to businesses, including individual fingerprinting and targeting. Its consumer services include online access to credit history and products meant to protect from fraud and identity theft. Like all credit reporting agencies, the company is required by U.S. law to provide consumers with one free credit report every year.

==History==
The company has its origins in Credit Data Corporation, a business which was acquired by TRW Inc. in 1968, and subsequently renamed TRW Information Systems and Services Inc.

In November 1996, TRW sold the unit, as Experian, to Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners. Just one month later, the two firms sold Experian to The Great Universal Stores Limited in Manchester, England, a retail conglomerate with millions of customers paying for goods on credit (later renamed GUS). GUS merged its own credit-information business, CCN, which at the time was the largest credit-service company in the UK, into Experian.

In October 2006, Experian was demerged from GUS and listed on the London Stock Exchange.

In August 2005, Experian accepted a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over charges that Experian had violated a previous settlement with the FTC. The FTC alleged that ads for the &quot;free credit report&quot; did not adequately disclose that Experian customers would automatically be enrolled in Experian&#x27;s $79.95 credit-monitoring program.

In January 2008, Experian announced that it would cut more than 200 jobs at its Nottingham office.

Experian shut down its Canadian operations on 14 April 2009.

In March 2017, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Experian $3 million for providing invalid credit scores to consumers.

In October 2017, Experian acquired Clarity Services, a credit bureau specialising in alternative consumer data.

In October 2024, Experian agreed to acquire Brazilian digital fraud prevention provider ClearSale for $350 million.

==Operations==
In the United States, like the other major credit reporting bureaus, Experian is chiefly regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, signed into law in 2003, amended the FCRA to require the credit reporting companies to provide consumers with one free copy of their credit report per 12-month period. Like its main competitors, TransUnion and Equifax, Experian markets credit reports directly to consumers. Experian heavily markets its for-profit credit reporting service, FreeCreditReport.com, and all three agencies have been criticised and even sued for selling credit reports that can be obtained at no cost.

Its market segmentation tool, Mosaic, is used by political parties to identify groups of voters. In the British version there are 15 main groups, broken down into 89 hyperspecific categories, from &quot;corporate chieftains&quot; to &quot;golden empty-nesters&quot; which can be taken down to the level of individual postcodes. It was first used by the Labour Party, but then taken up by the Conservatives in the 2015 General Election campaign.

==Sales to identity thieves==
In 2013 a Vietnamese national, Hieu Minh Ngo, was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with attempting to sell personally identifiable information on hundreds of thousands of U.S. residents. This information had been allegedly purchased from Experian subsidiary and data aggregator Court Ventures. However, Ngo testified under oath that the information he had sold to identity thieves had actually been acquired from another hacker based in Russia, and not Experian or Court Ventures. Ngo then resold the information he acquired from the Russian hacker through the identity fraud enabling websites Superget.info and Findget.me. The information offered for anonymous sale on these websites included individual&#x27;s name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, place of work, duration of work, state driver&#x27;s licence number, mother&#x27;s maiden name, bank account number(s), bank routing number(s), email account(s) and other account passwords.

==Data breaches==

=== 2015 ===

On 1 October 2015 Experian announced that they had discovered a data breach existing between 1 September 2013 and 16 September 2015. As many as 15 million people who used the company&#x27;s services, among them customers of American cellular company T-Mobile who had applied for Experian credit checks, may have had their private information exposed.

=== 2020 ===
In 2020 it was revealed that Experian had suffered a further data breach, on this occasion in South Africa. Initially, Experian claimed that the incident had been contained but subsequently this was shown to be untrue. Data on 24 million South Africans was leaked, as well as on nearly 800,000 businesses. Of these, 24,838 had financial details leaked.

=== 2021 ===
In January 2021 a new leak was revealed in Brazil, with the source being linked to Experian&#x27;s Brazilian subsidiary Serasa Experian. The breach resulted in data of 220 million citizens (including some already dead) being sold in the web. This is probably the most severe data breach in history, as it includes names, social security numbers, income tax declaration forms, addresses and other private information on nearly all Brazilian citizens. Experian claims there&#x27;s no evidence that its systems have been compromised, but this lack of evidence doesn&#x27;t explain it being the only probable source for the data. According to a Brazilian consumer rights foundation, the company has not been handling the breach appropriately.

=== 2022 ===

In late 2022 a flaw was revealed in Experian&#x27;s website which allowed access to individual credit reports without full authentication, simply by changing the last part of the URL being requested from &quot;/acr/oow/&quot; to &quot;/acr/report.&quot; The flaw was fixed in early 2023, but it was not known how much data had been stolen through this security weakness.

<text>The TI-86 is a programmable graphing calculator introduced in 1996 which was produced by Texas Instruments. The TI-86 uses the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. It is partially backwards-compatible with its predecessor, the TI-85.

In addition to having a larger screen than the TI-83, the TI-86 also allows the user to type in lower case and Greek letters and features five softkeys, which improve menu navigation and can be programmed by the user for quick access to common operations such as decimal-to-fraction conversion. The calculator also handles vectors, matrices and complex numbers better than the TI-83. One drawback, however, is that the statistics package on the TI-83 range doesn&#x27;t come preloaded on the TI-86. However, it can be downloaded from the Texas Instruments program archive and installed on the calculator using the link cable.

The TI-86 has been discontinued.

<doc id="545982" wikidata="Q157966" url="?curid=545982" title="Amenhotep I">
<text>Amenhotep I () or Amenophis I ( from Ancient Greek Ἀμένωφις), was the second Pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC (Low Chronology).

He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari but had an elder brother, Ahmose-ankh, and was not expected to inherit the throne. However, sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I&#x27;s 17th regnal year and his death, his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince. He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years.

Although his reign is poorly documented, it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence. He inherited the kingdom formed by his father&#x27;s military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant. He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple, setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom. After his death, he was deified as a patron god of Deir el-Medina.
==Family==

Amenhotep I was the son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brother, the crown prince Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus clearing the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his older sister, Ahmose-Meritamon, as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife&#x27;s name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.

Beyond this, the relationships between Amenhotep I and other possible family members are unclear. Ahhotep II is usually called his wife and sister, despite an alternative theory that she was his grandmother. He is thought to have had one son by Ahhotep II, Amenemhat, who died while still very young. This remains the consensus, although there are arguments against that relationship as well. With no living heirs, Amenhotep was succeeded by Thutmose I, who he married to his &quot;sister&quot;, Ahmose. Since Ahmose is never given the title &quot;King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in any inscription, some scholars doubt whether she was a sibling of Amenhotep I.

==Dates and length of reign==

===New Kingdom high and low chronology===
In Year 9 of Amenhotep, a heliacal rise of Sothis was observed on the ninth day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, the observation was made on that day in 1537 BC (NK High Chronology). If the observation was made in Thebes, then the event occurred in 1517 BC (NK Low Chronology). 
Consequently, the Heliacal rise of Sothis suggests the accession of Amenhotep I was either in 1546 (1545 Year 1) or 1526 BC (1525 Year 1). Because Thebes was the capital during the early 18th Dynasty, Egyptologists traditionally set the accession date in 1526 BC.

===Reign length===
Manetho&#x27;s Epitome states that Amenhotep I ruled Egypt for twenty years and seven months or twenty-one years, depending on the source. While Amenhotep I&#x27;s highest attested regnal year is only his Year 10, Manetho&#x27;s statement is confirmed by a passage in the tomb autobiography of a magician named Amenemhet. This explicitly states that he served under Amenhotep I for 21 years. Thus, in the high chronology, Amenhotep I is given a reign from around 1546 to 1526 BC and, in the low chronology, from around 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC, though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years.

==Foreign policy==
Amenhotep I&#x27;s Horus and Two Ladies names, &quot;Bull who conquers the lands&quot; and &quot;He who inspires great terror,&quot; are generally interpreted to mean that Amenhotep I intended to dominate the surrounding nations. Two tomb texts indicate that he led campaigns into Nubia. According to the tomb texts of Ahmose, son of Ebana, Amenhotep later sought to expand Egypt&#x27;s border southward into Nubia and he led an invasion force which defeated the Nubian army. The tomb biography of Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet says he also fought in a campaign in Kush, however it is quite possible that it refers to the same campaign as Ahmose, son of Ebana. Amenhotep built a temple at Saï, showing that he had established Egyptian settlements almost as far as the Third Cataract.

A single reference in the tomb of Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu in the land of Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek&#x27;s identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.

Egypt had lost the western desert and the oases during the Second Intermediate Period, and during the revolt against the Hyksos, Kamose thought it necessary to garrison them. It is uncertain when they were fully retaken, but on one stele, the title &quot;Prince-Governor of the oases&quot; was used, which means that Amenhotep&#x27;s reign forms the &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for the return of Egyptian rule.

There are no recorded campaigns in Syro-Palestine during Amenhotep I&#x27;s reign. However, according to the Tombos Stela of his successor, Thutmose I, when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia all the way to the Euphrates, he found no one who fought against him. If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one, it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead, which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign. One of the candidates for Amenhotep&#x27;s tomb contains a reference to Qedmi, which is somewhere in Canaan or the Transjordan, and Amenemhet&#x27;s tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni. However, neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning, nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhotep&#x27;s reign. The location of Amenhotep&#x27;s tomb is not certain, and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni. Records from Amenhotep&#x27;s reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a conclusion about any Syrian campaign.

==Cultural and intellectual developments==
Large numbers of statues of Amenhotep have been found, but they are mostly from the Ramesside period and relate to his continuing funerary cult, made for his posthumous funerary cult. This makes study of the art of his reign difficult. Based upon his few authentic statues, it appears that Amenhotep continued the practice of copying Middle Kingdom styles. Art in the early 18th dynasty was particularly similar to that of the early Middle Kingdom, and the statues produced by Amenhotep I clearly copied those of Mentuhotep II and Senusret I. The two types are so similar that modern Egyptologists have had trouble telling the two apart.

It was probably Amenhotep I who founded the artisans village at Deir el-Medina, whose inhabitants were responsible for much of the art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles. The earliest name found there is that of Thutmose I, however Amenhotep was clearly an important figure to the city&#x27;s workmen since he and his mother were both its patron deities.

Amenhotep&#x27;s reign saw literary developments. The Book of What is in the Underworld (&#x27;the Egyptian Book of the Dead&#x27;), an important funerary text used in the New Kingdom, is believed to have reached its final form during Amenhotep&#x27;s reign, since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).

It appears that during Amenhotep I&#x27;s reign the first water clock was invented. Amenhotep&#x27;s court astronomer Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism dates to the reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping, because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When the nights were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately.

==Building projects==
Amenhotep began or continued a number of building projects at temple sites in Upper Egypt but most of the structures he built were later dismantled or obliterated by his successors. From written sources it is known that he commissioned the architect Ineni to expand the Temple of Karnak. Ineni&#x27;s tomb biography indicates that he created a 20-cubit gate of limestone on the south side of Karnak. He constructed a sacred barque chapel of Amun out of alabaster and a copy of the White Chapel of Senusret III. Sculpted material from these structures has been recovered from the fill of Amenhotep III&#x27;s third pylon allowing some of these structures to be rebuilt at Karnak. Amenhotep also built structures at Karnak for his Sed festival, a festival by which a pharaoh&#x27;s strength and vigour was renewed after reigning 30 years, but it seems likely that he died before he could use them. A temple was constructed in Nubia at Saï, and he built temple structures in Upper Egypt at Elephantine, Kom Ombo, Abydos, and the Temple of Nekhbet. As far as is known Amenhotep did not build anything of significance in Lower Egypt, like his father.

===Mortuary complex===
Amenhotep I was the first king of Egypt to separate his mortuary temple from his tomb, probably in an attempt to keep his tomb safe from robbers. This temple was sited at the north end of Deir el-Bahri. Deir el-Bahri appears to have had some sort of funerary significance for Amenhotep, since Theban Tomb 358, the tomb of his queen Ahmose-Meritamon, was also found nearby. Amenhotep&#x27;s mortuary temple was largely demolished to make way for the lower terrace of the mortuary temple constructed approximately 50 years later by Queen Hatshepsut, and only a few bricks inscribed with Amenhotep&#x27;s name remain. The royal statues inside of the temple were moved to the nearby funerary temple of Mentuhotep II.

==Tomb and burial==
The original location of Amenhotep&#x27;s tomb has not been securely identified. A report on the security of royal tombs in the Theban Necropolis commissioned during the troubled reign of Ramesses IX noted that it was then intact, but its location was not specified. Two sites for Amenhotep I&#x27;s tomb have been proposed, one high up in the Valley of the Kings, KV39 and the other at Dra&#x27; Abu el-Naga&#x27;, Tomb ANB. Excavations at KV 39 suggest it was used or reused to store the Deir el-Bahri Cache, which included the king&#x27;s well-preserved mummy, before its final reburial. However, Tomb ANB is considered the more likely possibility, because it contains objects bearing his name and the names of some family members.

===Mummy===
Sometime during the 20th or 21st Dynasty, Amenhotep&#x27;s original tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied and his body was moved for safety, probably more than once. It was found in the Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and was kept in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the cartonnage facial death mask intact. Amenhotep&#x27;s is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists. His body was x-rayed in 1932; his age at death was estimated at 40–50 years. He was x-rayed again in 1967, resulting in a much lower age estimate of 25 years at death based on the good condition of his teeth.

In April 2021 his mummy was moved to National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.


=== CT scan ===
The X-ray examinations of the mummy of King Amenhotep I failed to provide consistent data or detailed information on the mummy. In the plain x-ray examination, the three-dimensional (3D) information of the mummy is projected onto a two-dimensional X-ray film. The result is the superimposition of objects and bones which makes mummy characterization less satisfactory. In contrast, CT is an advanced form of X-ray that obtains hundreds of thin sections (slices) of the body and provides more detailed reconstructed images of soft tissues as well as bones. On 4 May 2019, his mummy was investigated using non-invasive CT scanning to gain insights into his physical appearance, health, cause of death, and mummification style. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional images of the mask, bandages, and mummy were generated using this technique. This study estimates his age at death as 35 years, based on the fusion of his epiphyses and condition of the pubic symphysis. His organs were removed through a vertical embalming incision and the body cavity stuffed with linen; the heart is present in the chest cavity. No attempt was made to remove the brain. No packing was inserted into the orbits and no subcutaneous padding is seen anywhere on the body. Each nostril was plugged with rolls of resin-treated linen. Amulets and items of jewelry are present inside the wrappings; a beaded girdle, likely of gold, is present at across the back of his hips. The body had suffered post-mortem damage at the hands of robbers, with his head, left arm, right hand, and right foot being detached; there is also a large hole in the front of his torso. Efforts were made to restore the body during his rewrapping and caching. His head and limbs were reattached, and his foot was supported by a board.

==Succession and legacy==
Amenhotep I is thought to have had only one child, a son who died in infancy, although some sources indicate he had no children.
Amenhotep I was succeeded by Thutmose I, apparently a senior military figure. It is unclear if there was any blood relationship between the two, although it has been suggested that Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep I&#x27;s probable uncle Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I&#x27;s name appears next to Amenhotep&#x27;s on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.

===Funerary cult===

Amenhotep was deified upon his death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir el-Medina. His mother, who lived at least one year longer than he did, was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany. As previously mentioned, the vast majority of Amenhotep&#x27;s statuary comes in the form of a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped, he had three deific manifestations: &quot;Amenhotep of the Town,&quot; &quot;Amenhotep Beloved of Amun,&quot; and &quot;Amenhotep of the Forecourt,&quot; and was known as a god who produced oracles. Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el-Medina, and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod (or be caused to nod) the answer. He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year. During the first month, a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen, which probably means his idol was taken to Deir el-Medina. Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month, and then two more were held in the seventh month. The first was the &quot;spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep,&quot; which probably commemorated the day of his death. The second, celebrated for four days at the very end of the month, was the &quot;great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town.&quot; Later in Egyptian history, the seventh month, &quot;Phamenoth&quot;, was named after this festival. Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month, and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month, which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep&#x27;s accession to the throne.

Further light is shed upon Amenhotep&#x27;s funerary cult by multiple documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri from the time of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a recitation of a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine at the end of the day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep&#x27;s idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.

<text>The Group Theatre was a theater collective based in New York City and formed in 1931 by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg. It was intended as a base for the kind of theatre they and their colleagues believed in—a forceful, naturalistic and highly disciplined artistry. They were pioneers of what would become an &quot;American acting technique&quot;, derived from the teachings of Konstantin Stanislavski, but pushed beyond them as well. The company included actors, directors, playwrights, and producers. The name &quot;Group&quot; came from the idea of the actors as a pure ensemble; a reference to the company as &quot;our group&quot; led them to &quot;accept the inevitable and call their company The Group Theatre.&quot;

The New York–based Group Theatre had no connection with the identically named Group Theatre based in London and founded in 1932.

In the ten years of its existence, the Group Theatre produced works by many important American playwrights, including Clifford Odets, Sidney Kingsley, Paul Green, Robert Ardrey, and Irwin Shaw. Its most notable productions included &quot;Success Story&quot; starring Stella Adler and Luther Adler, Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Awake and Sing&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and the 1937–38 Broadway hit &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, starring Luther Adler and Frances Farmer.

The Group Theatre included Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg, Cheryl Crawford, Stella Adler (a founding member), Morris Carnovsky, Clifford Odets, Sanford Meisner, Elia Kazan, Harry Morgan (billed as Harry Bratsburg), Robert Lewis, John Garfield (billed as Jules Garfield), Canada Lee, Franchot Tone, Frances Farmer, Phoebe Brand, Ruth Nelson, Will Geer, Howard da Silva, Sidney Lumet, John Randolph, Joseph Bromberg, Michael Gordon, Paul Green, Marc Blitzstein, Paul Strand, Anna Sokolow, Lee J. Cobb, Roman Bohnen, Jay Adler, Luther Adler, Robert Ardrey, Don Richardson and many others.

==History==

The Group Theatre&#x27;s first production was Paul Green&#x27;s &quot;The House of Connelly&quot; on September 23, 1931, at the Martin Beck Theatre. The company asked the Theatre Guild to help cover the $5,000 cost to perform. The Theatre Guild offered to pay the full amount if the group &quot;removed Mary Morris and Morris Carnovsky from the cast and restored the tragic ending&quot; from the more upbeat and hopeful rewrite Green produced. The group refused and instead raised half on its own, receiving support from Eugene O&#x27;Neill. The play was an immediate critical success and was recognized for the special ensemble performances which the group would develop.

The group&#x27;s production of John Howard Lawson&#x27;s &quot;Success Story,&quot; which chronicled the rise of a youthful idealist who sacrifices his principles as he rises to the top of the advertising business, received very mixed reviews, with Luther Adler and Stella Adler receiving the majority of the positive reviews.

The group took on novelist Dawn Powell&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Big Night&quot;, rehearsed it for six months and asked for extensive revisions from the playwright. The result was a critical and box-office disaster that ran a scant nine performances. Harold Clurman, who took over the production late in the rehearsal period, later admitted the group&#x27;s role in the fiasco. &quot;The play should have been done in four swift weeks—or not at all. We worried it and harried our actors with it for months.&quot;

Later, during the first full season (1933–34), &quot;Men in White&quot;, written by Sidney Kingsley, directed by Lee Strasberg and produced by Sidney Harmon, became a financial success for the group. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

On the night of January 5, 1935, some members of the group participated in a benefit performance for the &quot;New Theatre Magazine&quot;. Written by Clifford Odets and directed by Odets and Sanford Meisner, the one-act play &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; was performed at the Civic Repertory Theatre in New York City and became a theatrical legend. The play reflects a kind of street poetry that brought great acclaim to the group and to Odets as the new voice of social drama in the 1930s. Odets became the playwright most strongly identified with the group, and its productions of &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, both directed in 1935 by Harold Clurman, proved to be excellent vehicles for the Stanislavskian aesthetic. The following year, the group produced the Paul Green-Kurt Weill anti-war musical &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot;, directed by Strasberg.

The Group Theatre&#x27;s most successful production was the 1937–38 Broadway hit &quot;Golden Boy&quot;.

Elia Kazan directed Robert Ardrey&#x27;s plays &quot;Casey Jones&quot; and &quot;Thunder Rock&quot; in 1938 and 1939–40 for the Group Theatre.

The group gathered at different summer locations to rehearse and train intensively for six of its 10 years in existence. The group spent the summer of 1931 at Brookfield Center, 1936 at Pine Brook Country Club, located near Nichols, Connecticut. Other summer venues included Brookfield Center, Connecticut (1931); Dover Furnace in Dutchess County, New York (1932); Green Mansions in Warrensburg, New York in 1933; a large house in Ellenville, New York (1934); and Lake Grove in Smithtown, New York in 1939.

Despite its success and sweeping impact on the American theater landscape for many years to come, the group ended by 1941, and factors included the impending war, the lure of fame and fortune in Hollywood, the lack of institutional funding, and the friction of interpersonal relationships.

==Broadway productions==
==Influence==
After the war, in 1947, Robert Lewis, Elia Kazan, and Cheryl Crawford founded the Actors Studio, where the techniques inspired by Stanislavski and developed in the Group Theatre were refined. Under the leadership of Lee Strasberg, who later joined the Actors Studio and became its director in 1951, what is now referred to as The Method emerged as a lasting force in modern drama.

Institutionally, the Group Theatre influenced the Chelsea Theater Center, a later theater in New York (1960s and 1970s), born of idealism and destroyed by lack of funding and friction between its co-directors. Harold Prince invokes the group in his foreword to the book &quot;Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater.&quot;

== House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) ==
In the 1950s, many of the former members were called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Those who appeared as friendly witnesses, such as Elia Kazan, Clifford Odets, and Lee J. Cobb, avoided the fate of their colleagues who refused to name Communist Party members and, as a result, were blacklisted. Elia Kazan would later state he abandoned his Communist views in part because of an agenda to transform the Group Theatre into a company devoted to promoting &quot;Marxist ideology.&quot; Odets would share similar concerns after experiencing pressure from the party to change the direction of his writing.

Mark Kemble&#x27;s play &quot;Names&quot; covers the relationship between HUAC and the former members of the Group Theatre.

<doc id="545984" wikidata="Q904651" url="?curid=545984" title="Miyuki Kawanaka">
<text>is a Japanese enka singer. Her singing career spanned over four decades. She married Katsuo Yamada in 1991.

== Early life ==
Kawanaka was born Kimiko Kawanaka in Yonago, Tottori. At a young age, she moved to Suita, Osaka where she grew up. 

In 1973, at age 18, she debuted as Kasuga Harumi and tried to become a pop idol with the release of the songs &quot;Shinjuku Tenshin&quot; and &quot;Kantsubaki no Shima Kara&quot;. Both singles failed and she returned to Osaka to work at her mother&#x27;s okonomiyaki restaurant. 

In 1976, she won a contest singing &quot;Anatani Inochi Gake&quot;. She adopted stage name Miyuki Kawanaka and launched her second debut as an enka singer. In 1980 Kawanaka&#x27;s single &quot;Futarizake&quot; (ふたり酒) hit, with sales over a million copies.

Her second biggest hit, &quot;Niren-sou&quot; (二輪草) in 1998, which sold more than a million copies in Japan alone, spending 80 weeks in the top 100 of the &quot;oricon&quot; chart.

Kawanaka was invited to perform at the annual NHK Red and White Song Festival for 24 non-consecutive years, the 7th most on the all-time list for a female artist. Her last appearance at the prestigious programme was 2011, the 62nd edition of the show.

<doc id="545985" wikidata="Q860395" url="?curid=545985" title="Osteomalacia">
<text>Osteomalacia is a disease characterized by the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium. The impairment of bone metabolism causes inadequate bone mineralization.

Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term &quot;osteomalacia&quot; is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease. Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones. In addition to low systemic levels of circulating mineral ions (for example, caused by vitamin D deficiency or renal phosphate wasting) that result in decreased bone and tooth mineralization, accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting proteins and peptides (such as osteopontin and ASARM peptides), and small inhibitory molecules (such as pyrophosphate), can occur in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, contributing locally to cause matrix hypomineralization (osteomalacia/odontomalacia).

A relationship describing local, physiologic double-negative (inhibiting inhibitors) regulation of mineralization has been termed the &quot;Stenciling Principle&quot; of mineralization, whereby enzyme-substrate pairs imprint mineralization patterns into the extracellular matrix (most notably described for bone) by degrading mineralization inhibitors (&quot;e.g.&quot; TNAP/TNSALP/ALPL enzyme degrading the pyrophosphate inhibition, and PHEX enzyme degrading the osteopontin inhibition). The &quot;Stenciling Principle&quot; for mineralization is particularly relevant to the osteomalacia and odontomalacia observed in hypophosphatasia (HPP) and X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).

The most common cause of osteomalacia is a deficiency of vitamin D, which is normally derived from sunlight exposure and, to a lesser extent, from the diet. The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Less common causes of osteomalacia can include hereditary deficiencies of vitamin D or phosphate (which would typically be identified in childhood) or malignancy.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are measures that can be used to prevent and treat osteomalacia. Vitamin D should always be administered in conjunction with calcium supplementation (as the pair work together in the body) since most of the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are a result of impaired mineral ion homeostasis.

Nursing home residents and the housebound are at particular risk for vitamin D deficiency, as these populations typically receive little sun exposure. In addition, both the efficiency of vitamin D synthesis in the skin and the absorption of vitamin D from the intestine decline with age, thus further increasing the risk in these populations. Other groups at risk include individuals with absorption secondary to gastrointestinal bypass surgery or celiac disease, and individuals who immigrate from warm climates to cold climates, especially women who wear traditional veils or dresses that prevent sun exposure.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Many of the effects of the disease overlap with the more common osteoporosis, but both diseases are significantly different.

Osteomalacia in adults starts insidiously as aches and pains in the lumbar (lower back) region and thighs before spreading to the arms and ribs. The pain is symmetrical, non-radiating and accompanied by sensitivity in the involved bones. Proximal muscles are weak, and there is difficulty in climbing upstairs and getting up from a squatting position.
As a result of demineralization, the bones become less rigid. Physical signs include deformities like triradiate pelvis and lordosis. The patient has a typical &quot;waddling&quot; gait. However, these physical signs may derive from a previous osteomalacial state, since bones do not regain their original shape after they become deformed.

Pathologic fractures due to weight bearing may develop. Most of the time, the only alleged symptom is chronic fatigue, while bone aches are not spontaneous but only revealed by pressure or shocks. It differs from renal osteodystrophy, where the latter shows hyperphosphatemia.

== Causes ==
The causes of adult osteomalacia are varied, but ultimately result in a vitamin D deficiency:
There are two main mechanisms of osteomalacia:
# insufficient calcium absorption from the intestine because of lack of dietary calcium or a deficiency of, or resistance to, the action of vitamin D, or due to undiagnosed celiac disease.
# phosphate deficiency caused by increased renal losses.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Biochemical findings ===

Biochemical features are similar to those of rickets. The major factor is an abnormally low vitamin D concentration in blood serum. Major typical biochemical findings include:
* Low serum and urinary calcium
* Low serum phosphate, except in cases of renal osteodystrophy
* Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (due to an increase in compensatory osteoblast activity)
* Elevated parathyroid hormone (due to low calcium)

Furthermore, a technetium bone scan will show increased activity (also due to increased osteoblasts).

=== Radiographic characteristics ===

Radiological appearances include:
* Pseudofractures, also called Looser&#x27;s zones
* Protrusio acetabuli, a hip joint disorder

== Prevention ==
Prevention of osteomalacia rests on having an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium, or other treatments if the osteomalacia hereditary (genetic). Vitamin D3 Supplementation is often needed due to the scarcity of Vitamin D sources in the modern diet.

== Treatment ==
Nutritional osteomalacia responds well to administration of 2,000-10,000 IU of vitamin D3 by mouth daily. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is typically absorbed more readily than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Osteomalacia due to malabsorption may require treatment by injection or daily oral dosing of significant amounts of vitamin D3.

== Etymology ==
Osteomalacia is derived from Greek: &quot;osteo-&quot; which means &quot;bone&quot;, and &quot;malacia&quot; which means &quot;softness&quot;. In the past, the disease was also known as &quot;malacosteon&quot; and its Latin-derived equivalent, mollities ossium. Osteomalacia is associated with increase in osteoid maturation time.

<text>Eliza Poe ( Elizabeth Arnold; formerly Hopkins; 1787 – December 8, 1811) was an English-American actress and the mother of the American author Edgar Allan Poe.

==Early life==

Arnold was born to Henry and Elizabeth Arnold in London in the spring of 1787. Her mother was a stage actress in London from 1791 to 1795. Her father Henry is thought to have died in 1790. In November 1795, Eliza and her mother sailed from England to Boston, Massachusetts, where they arrived on January 3, 1796.

==Career==
===Boston===

In Boston, Arnold debuted on stage at the age of nine, only three months after her arrival in the United States. She played a character named Biddy Blair in David Garrick&#x27;s farce &quot;Miss in Her Teens&quot; and was praised in the &quot;Portland Herald&quot;: &quot;Miss Arnold, in Miss Biddy, exceeded all praise.. Although a miss of only nine years old, her powers as an Actress will do credit to any of her sex of maturer age&quot;. Later that year, Elizabeth married musician Charles Tubbs, who had sailed with the Arnolds from England. The small family joined with a manager Mr. Edgar to form a theater troupe called the Charleston Comedians. Elizabeth, Eliza&#x27;s mother, died sometime while this troupe was traveling through North Carolina. Little is known about her death but she disappears from theatrical records in 1798 and it is presumed she died shortly after.

After her mother&#x27;s death, Eliza stayed with the theater troupe. She followed the tradition at the time for actors to travel from city to city to perform for as long as several months before moving on. The actors, theaters, and audiences had a wide range of sophistication. One of the most impressive venues at which she performed was the Chestnut Street Theater near Independence Hall in Philadelphia, which seated 2,000. Over the course of her career she played some 300 parts, as well as choral and dancing roles, including William Shakespeare characters Juliet Capulet and Ophelia.

===Marriage and children===

In the summer of 1802, at the age of fifteen, Eliza married Charles Hopkins. Hopkins died three years later in October 1805, possibly of yellow fever, leaving Eliza an 18-year-old widow. The Baltimore-born David Poe Jr. saw Eliza performing in Norfolk, Virginia, and decided to join her acting troupe, abandoning his family&#x27;s plans for him to study law. Poe married Eliza only six months after Hopkins&#x27;s death in 1806.

The couple traveled throughout New England and the rest of the northeast, playing in various towns such as Richmond, Philadelphia, and at an outdoor summer theater in New York City before finally settling in Boston. They stayed in Boston for three consecutive seasons of thirty weeks each in a theater that fit an audience of about one thousand. Reviews at the time often remarked on Eliza&#x27;s &quot;interesting figure&quot; and &quot;sweetly melodious voice&quot;. 

Though times were difficult, the couple had two sons; William Henry Leonard was born in January 1807, nine months after their wedding, and Edgar was born on January 19, 1809, at a boarding house near Boston Common, close to where their troupe was performing. Eliza performed until 10 days before Edgar&#x27;s birth and may have named her second son after the Mr. Edgar who led the Charleston Comedians.

===New York City===
The family relocated to New York City in the summer of 1809. Eliza had often been praised for her acting ability while David&#x27;s performances were routinely criticized harshly, possibly due to his own stage fright. David, an ill-tempered alcoholic, abandoned the stage and his family about six weeks after moving to New York. Though David&#x27;s fate is unknown, there is some evidence to suggest he died in Norfolk on December 11, 1811. Eliza gave birth to a third child, a daughter she called Rosalie, in December 1810. Eliza continued traveling as she performed.

==Death==

In 1811, while staying at a boarding house in Richmond, Virginia, for a performance, Eliza began spitting blood. Her performances became less frequent until October 1811 when she stopped appearing altogether. Her last performance was on October 11, 1811, as Countess Wintersen in a play called &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

Friends and fellow actors Mr. and Mrs. Luke Usher (the name may have inspired Poe&#x27;s tale &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;) took care of the children during Eliza&#x27;s illness and many in the Richmond area took an interest in her health. On November 29 of that year, the Richmond Theater announced a benefit performance on her behalf. A local publication, the &quot;Enquirer&quot;, reported her need for help: &quot;On this night, &quot;Mrs. Poe&quot;, lingering on the bed of disease and surrounded by her children, asks your assistance and &quot;asks it perhaps for the last time&quot;&quot;.

Eliza finally died on Sunday morning, December 8, 1811, at the age of twenty-four, surrounded by her children. It is generally assumed that she died of tuberculosis. She is buried at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Richmond. Though her actual burying place is unknown, a memorial marks the general area.

After her death, her three children were split up. William Henry Leonard Poe lived with his paternal grandparents in Baltimore, Edgar Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan in Richmond, and Rosalie Poe was adopted by William and Jane Scott Mackenzie in Richmond, Virginia.

==Legacy==
Though he was young when she died, Edgar Allan Poe was heavily affected by Eliza Poe&#x27;s death and many of his works reflect her influence. His first published work &quot;Metzengerstein&quot; features a fire burning down a large home, possibly reflecting the fire that destroyed the Richmond Theatre, where she had performed. The fire occurred in December 1811, only three weeks after her death. 

The early loss of his mother and other women, including his wife Virginia, may also have inspired Edgar Poe&#x27;s often-used literary theme of dying women. This theme is readily present in works like &quot;The Raven&quot;.

<text>Gen (also called Gɛ̃, Gɛn gbe, Gebe, Guin, Mina, Mina-Gen, and Popo) is a Gbe language spoken in the southeast of Togo in the Maritime Region. Like the other Gbe languages, Gen is a tonal language.

== History ==
The Gen-Mina originated from Accra and Elmina in Ghana. The Mina from Elmina migrated because of the Denkyira wars of aggression, while the Gen came over from Accra after their defeat in the Akwamu wars. The two groups intermingled with the indigenous Ewe, resulting in their Ewe dialect having words borrowed from Fanti, Ga-Adangbe and various European languages.

The Gen language is mutually intelligible with Ewe and is considered to be one of the many dialects of Ewe.

There were 476,000 Gen-speakers in Togo in 2019, and 144,000 in Benin in 2021.

<text>Edgar Allen (May 2, 1892 – February 3, 1943) was an American anatomist and physiologist. He is known for the discovery of estrogen and his role in creating the field of endocrinology.

Born on Cañon (Canyon) City, Colorado, Allen was educated at Brown University. After serving in World War I he took a position at Washington University School of Medicine in 1919 until, in 1923, he was appointed to the chair of anatomy at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Ten years later he was appointed to the chair at Yale University.

At Missouri, he began his studies of sex hormones. While it was commonly believed at the time that the female reproductive cycle was controlled by substance in the &quot;corpus luteum&quot;, Allen sought the answer in the follicles surrounding the ovum, leading to his discovery of estrogen, though it was identified six years later by Adolf Butenandt in 1929.

Allen died of a heart attack in 1943 while on duty with the United States Coast Guard.

<doc id="546009" wikidata="Q183472" url="?curid=546009" title="Itai-itai disease">
<text>was the name given to the mass cadmium poisoning of Toyama Prefecture, Japan, starting around 1912. The term &quot;&quot;itai-itai&quot; disease&quot; was coined by locals for the severe pains (Japanese: 痛い &quot;itai&quot;) people with the condition felt in the spine and joints. Cadmium (Cd) poisoning can also cause softening of the bones and kidney failure. Effective treatments involve the use of chelators to promote urinary excretion of Cd. The cadmium was released into rivers by mining companies in the mountains, which were successfully sued for the damage. Remediation efforts in the affected region have been ongoing since 1972 and were mostly complete as of 2012. Monetary costs of the cleanup have been paid for in part by Japan&#x27;s national government, Mitsui Mining, and the Gifu and Toyama prefectural governments. Itai-itai disease is known as one of the Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;itai-itai disease&quot; (in Japanese イタイイタイ病 &quot;itai-itai byō&quot;, &quot;it hurts-it hurts disease&quot; or &quot;ouch-ouch disease&quot;) was coined by the affected locals for the severe pains that people with itai-itai disease felt in the spine and joints. In Japanese 痛い &quot;itai&quot; is used as an adjective meaning &quot;painful&quot; or as an interjection equivalent to &quot;ouch&quot;.

== Causes ==
Itai-itai disease was caused by cadmium poisoning due to mining in Toyama Prefecture. Regular mining for silver started in 1589, and soon thereafter, mining for lead, copper, and zinc began. The earliest records of mining for gold in the area date back to 1710. Cadmium is a metal byproduct of mining that is toxic to most organisms.

Animal studies have shown that cadmium poisoning alone is not enough to elicit all of the symptoms of itai-itai disease. These studies point to damage of the mitochondria of kidney cells by cadmium as a key factor of the disease.

== History ==
Increased demand for raw materials during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I, as well as new mining technologies from Europe, increased the output of the mines, putting the Kamioka Mines in Toyama among the world&#x27;s top mines. Production increased even more before World War II. Starting in 1910 and continuing through 1945, cadmium was released in significant quantities by mining operations, and the disease first appeared around 1912.

In the 1920s, levels of contaminated tailing waste increased after the creation of new froth flotation processes that boosted zinc production. Fine powdered mineral particles formed in the frothing process escaped and drifted downriver. These particles were subsequently oxidized into ions that were absorbed by aquatic plants, rice crops, fish, and subsequently, humans. Sphalerite, the main zinc containing ore in Komioka, is almost always coupled with greenockite, the only major cadmium-containing mineral in the world. Because of this, cadmium is a regular by-product of the zinc ore mining process. Up until 1948, cadmium was discarded as waste into the Jinzū River due to it being of no industrial value, exacerbating the levels of the element&#x27;s release into the waterbody.

Prior to World War II, the mining, controlled by the Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Co., Ltd., increased to satisfy wartime demand. This subsequently increased the pollution of the Jinzū River and its tributaries. The river was used mainly for irrigation of rice fields, but also for drinking water, washing, fishing, and other uses by downstream populations.

When the population complained to Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Co. about this pollution, the company built a basin to store the mining waste water before leading it into the river. This proved ineffective, and many had already been sickened. The causes of the poisoning were not well understood and, up to 1946, it was thought to be simply a regional disease or a type of bacterial infection.

Medical tests started in the 1940s and 1950s, searching for the cause of the disease. Initially, it was expected to be lead poisoning due to the lead mining upstream. Only in 1955 did Dr. Hagino and his colleagues suspect cadmium as the cause of the disease. Toyama Prefecture also started an investigation in 1961, determining that the Mitsui Mining and Smelting&#x27;s Kamioka Mining Station caused the cadmium pollution and that the worst-affected areas were downstream of the mine. In 1968, the Ministry of Health and Welfare issued a statement about the symptoms of &quot;itai-itai&quot; disease caused by the cadmium poisoning.

The reduction of the levels of cadmium in the water supply reduced the number of new cases; no new case has been recorded since 1946. While the people with the worst symptoms came from Toyama prefecture, the government found patients with itai-itai disease in five other prefectures.

After the first reports of Itai-Itai in 1912, it took 55 years for the epidemiological investigation to discover that the disease was due to cadmium poisoning. Delayed bureaucratic response was a common thread in the Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan.

The mines are still in operation and cadmium pollution levels remain high, although improved nutrition and medical care has reduced the occurrence of itai-itai disease.

=== Cadmium pollution in Jinzū river ===

Over time, the cadmium that was released as industrial waste began to accumulate in the soil, algae and river organisms. This resulted in the local phytoplankton and algal species absorbing it in high quantities. Cadmium was subsequently passed through the food web to fish consumers. Fish also bioaccumulated cadmium through passive transport in the gills. Cadmium adversely affected fish, causing endocrine disruption and inhibited reproduction, and sometimes mortality.

Due to the residents being unaware of the cadmium and its dangers, they used the water from the Jinzū to irrigate their rice fields. Cadmium is highly water-soluble and the rice paddies&#x27; prolonged exposure led to the rice quickly becoming contaminated and toxic. The local residents’ consumption of this rice and drinking water then resulted in elevated cadmium body burdens – leading directly to symptoms characteristic of itai-itai disease. Cadmium is now considered one of the most dangerous toxic metals due to its ability to threaten food safety through being easily be absorbed into the rice paddies, then subsequently the rice.

=== Cadmium accumulation in a human body ===
Studies conducted to estimate the amount of cadmium exposure necessary to develop Itai-Itai disease found permissible lifetime cadmium intake (LCD) levels for humans to be 1.7 to 2.1 g. When Itai-Itai disease was first being recognized in just 5% of the affected population, LCD levels are estimated to have already been at 2.6 g.

Cadmium accumulates mainly in the liver and the kidneys, but has more of an effect on the kidneys. The severe symptoms seen in Itai-itai disease are a direct result of prolonged exposure to cadmium.

Cadmium enters the kidneys by binding to metallothionein in the blood and traveling to the glomerulus in the kidney. Once the cadmium makes it into the tubular cells in the kidneys, the cadmium is released and accumulates in the renal cortex until it reaches toxic levels. When cadmium reaches dangerous levels in the renal cortex, it can deactivate metal-dependent enzymes or activate calmodulin, which plays a role in smooth muscle contraction by sensing calcium levels.

Once the kidneys have experienced extensive damage, those affected begin experiencing musculoskeletal damage, due to the disruption of calcium homeostasis. This musculoskeletal damage is what causes the bone pain and bone deformities that characterize itai-itai disease.

== Society ==

=== Legal action ===
29 plaintiffs, consisting of nine people with itai-itai disease and 20 of their family members, sued the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. in 1968 in the Toyama Prefectural court. In June 1971, the court found the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. guilty. Subsequently, the company appealed to the Nagoya District Court in Kanazawa, but the appeal was rejected in August 1972. The Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. agreed to pay for the medical care of the people who had been affected, finance the monitoring of the water quality performed by the residents, and pay reparations to the people with the disease. Out of the four major pollution events, it was only in the case of itai-itai disease that those affected succeeded in accomplishing almost complete pollution control through legal action.

People who believe that they have &quot;itai-itai&quot; disease have to contact the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare to have their claims assessed. Many people with itai-itai disease were not satisfied with government actions and demanded a change in the official procedures. This caused the government to review the criteria for recognizing a patient legally; the government also reassessed the treatment of the disease.

A person is considered to have &quot;itai-itai&quot; disease if he or she lived in the contaminated areas, has kidney dysfunctions and softening of the bones, but not related heart problems. 184 patients have been legally recognized since 1967, of whom 54 were recognized in the period from 1980 to 2000. An additional 388 people have been identified as potential patients, those who had not been officially examined yet. Fifteen people with itai-itai were still alive .

=== Remediation process ===
Following the trial victory of the plaintiffs over the Mitsui Mining Co in 1972, Mitsui Mining agreed to begin the process of remediation for the mine, as well as the surrounding farmland and river region. This process began with the first on-site inspection conducted by a team of scientists and government officials. These whole site inspections continue to take place yearly, with additional specialty inspections conducted 6–7 times throughout the year. These specialty checks specifically monitor water originating from the mine, as it has high levels of cadmium, which requires it to be separated and diverted to the Kamioka Mine slag dump. The water and solids are separated and processed before leaving the mine to ensure no groundwater contamination to the surrounding area. The treatment facilities&#x27; exhaust is also monitored to ensure the absence of cadmium in the airborne byproduct of the zinc refining process.

Continuous inspections following the lawsuit have documented considerable decreases in cadmium levels. Total amounts of cadmium discarded decreased from per month in 1972 to per month in 2010; the average concentration of cadmium in the mine&#x27;s discharge had been reduced to 1.2 ppb in 2010 from 9 ppb in 1972; and in response to improved dust collection methods, the total amount of cadmium discharged in smoke dropped from &gt; per month in 1972 to per month in 2010. In 1996, the mean concentration of cadmium in agricultural lands had returned to the background level of 0.1 ppb, signifying trivial cadmium outflow. This is a success in regards to the lawsuit.

The cadmium pollution had also contaminated many of the agricultural areas surrounding the mine. As a response to the metal pollution, the Japanese government enacted the Prevention of Soil Contamination in Agricultural Land Law of 1970. It ordered planting to be stopped so that restoration of the soil could be implemented in areas with 1ppm of cadmium or more in the soil. Surveying in Toyama Prefecture began in 1971, and by 1977, along the Jinzū River were designated for soil restoration. These farmers were compensated for lost crops and for lost production in past years by the Mitsui Mining and Smelting, Toyama Prefecture, and the national government. , only remained contaminated.

In 1992, the average annual health expense compensation was ¥743 million. Agricultural damage was compensated with ¥1.75 billion per year, or a total of annually ¥2.518 billion. Another ¥620 million were invested annually to reduce further pollution of the river.

On 17 March 2012, officials concluded the cleanup project of the cadmium-polluted areas in the Jinzū River basin. of topsoil had been replaced since the cleanup began in 1979 at a total cost of ¥40.7 billion. The project had been financed by the Japanese national government, Mitsui Mining, and the Gifu and Toyama prefectural governments.

<text>The Charrúa are an Indigenous people or Indigenous Nation of the Southern Cone in present-day Uruguay and the adjacent areas in Argentina (Entre Ríos) and Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul). They were a semi-nomadic people who sustained themselves mainly through hunting and gathering. Since resources were not permanent in every region, they would constantly be on the move. Rain, drought, and other environmental factors determined their movement. For this reason they are often classified as seasonal nomads.

The Charrúa people were massacred in a campaign in 1831 by the colonial forces in Uruguay known as the Massacre of Salsipuedes. Though largely erased from modern histories, some communities of the Charrúa survived outside of Uruguay in Argentina and Brazil. It is believed that there are approximately between 160,000 and 300,000 individuals in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil today who are descendants of surviving Charrúa. Contemporary descendants of the Charrúa have created organizations and advocate for the memory of the indigenous people.

==History==
The life of the Charrúas before contact with the Spanish Colonists remains to a large extent a mystery since most knowledge about the Charrúas comes from Spanish contact with them.

Chroniclers such as the Jesuit Pedro Lozano accused the Charrúan people of killing the Spanish explorer Juan Díaz de Solís during his 1515 voyage up the Río de la Plata. This was a crucial moment since it shows that the Charrúas were prepared to resist the Spanish invaders. Following the arrival of European settlers, the Charrúa, along with the Chana, strongly resisted the territorial invasion. In the 18th and 19th centuries the Charrúa were confronted by cattle exploitation that strongly altered their way of life, causing famine and forcing them to rely on cows and sheep. However, these were in that epoch increasingly privatized . &quot;Malones&quot; (raids) were resisted by settlers who freely shot any indigenous people who were in their way. Charrúas would move to the shore in summer to fish and gather clams, fruits, and roots and moved inland in winter to hunt deer, rheas, and smaller game with bolas (stones connected by short ropes that are thrown to ensnare prey) and bows and arrows.

==Genocide==

The drastic demographic reduction of the Charrúas did not occur until the administration of the first president of Uruguay, Fructuoso Rivera. Although Rivera initially maintained a good relationship with the Charrúas, the increasing dominance of the white people and desires for expansion led to hostilities. He therefore organized a genocide campaign known as &quot;La Campaña de Salsipuedes&quot; in 1831. This campaign was composed of three different attacks in three different places: &quot;El Paso del Sauce del Queguay&quot;, &quot;El Salsipuedes&quot;, and a passage known as &quot;La Cueva del Tigre&quot;. Legend has it that the first attack was a betrayal. Rivera knew the tribal leaders and called them to his barracks by the river, later named &quot;Salsipuedes&quot;. He claimed that he needed their help to defend territory and that they should join him, however, once the Charrúas were drunk and off their guard, the Uruguayan soldiers attacked them. The following two attacks were carried out to eliminate the Charrúas that had escaped or had not been present.
It is said that since 11 April 1831, when the Salsipuedes (meaning &quot;Get-out-if-you-can&quot;) campaign was launched by a group led by Bernabé Rivera, nephew of Fructuoso Rivera, the Charrúas were then officially claimed to be extinct.

Four surviving Charrúas were captured at Salsipuedes. The directory of the Oriental School of Montevideo thought a nearly extinct race would spark the interest of French scientists and the public. They were Senacua Sénaqué, a medicine man; Vaimaca-Pirú Sira, a warrior; and a young couple, Laureano Tacuavé Martínez and María Micaëla Guyunusa. All four were taken to Paris in 1833, where they were exhibited to the public. The display was not a success and they all soon died in France, including a baby daughter born to Sira and Guyunusa, and adopted by Tacuavé. The child was named María Mónica Micaëla Igualdad Libertad by the Charrúa, yet she was filed by the French as Caroliné Tacouavé. A monumental sculpture, &quot;Los Últimos Charrúas&quot; was built in their memory in Montevideo, Uruguay.

After Salsipuedes, the Charrúa were gradually dispossessed of their sovereignty while the new state was affirming its jurisdiction over the whole territory. According to the Argentine census of 2001, there were 676 Charrúas living in the province of Entre Ríos, Argentina.

==Legacy==

Following the end of Uruguay&#x27;s last dictatorship in 1985, a group of people has been affirming and vindicating their Charrúan ancestry.

In August 1989, the Association of Descendants of the Charrúa Nation (ADENCH, Asociación de Descendientes de la Nación Charrúa) was created to rescue, conserve, and promulgate the knowledge and presence of indigenous peoples in Uruguay. In 2005, another organisation was formed, the Council of the Charrúa Nation (CONACHA, Consejo de la Nación Charrúa) – where families came out of clandestinity and publicly self-recognized themselves as Charrúa.

Not much is known about the Charrúa due to their cognitive erasure at an early time in Uruguayan history. The only surviving documents that concern the Charrúa are those of Spanish explorers, archaeologists, and anthropologists. A new body of literature is currently emerging about their oral history, contemporary ethnogenesis and activism.

It is believed that there are approximately between 160,000 and 300,000 individuals in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil today who are descendants of surviving Charrúa.

On November 9, 2007 the Câmara dos Vereadores of Porto Alegre held a Solemn Act to recognize the Charruas as an existing native Brazilian people. The event was jointly organized by the Human Rights Commission of the Câmara dos Vereadores of Porto Alegre and the Human Rights Commission of the National Congress of Brazil. During the Act, Senators Paulo Paim and Sérgio Zambiasi congratulated the indigenous people for their &quot;conquest and effort in a struggle that has lasted 172 years&quot;. The life of cacica-geral Acuab, the most notable Charrua chief of Rio Grande do Sul and the first female cacique of the Charruas, was the subject of the documentary &quot;Perambulantes&quot; (Brazil, 2009), by Giancarla Brunnetto e Karine Emerich. Acuab, cacique of Aldeia Polidoro, is credited with going to Brasilia and handing over to then-President Lula a document that asked for the recognition of her people by Fundação National do Índio. Acuab reached the President after evading his security detail. This recognition would come in September, 2007. By 2008 the city of Porto Alegre would grant Aldeia Polidoro (a 9-ha area) the status of municipal indigenous territory.

Uruguayans refer to themselves as &quot;&quot;charrúa&quot; when in the context of a competition or battle against a foreign contingent. In situations in which Uruguayans display bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, the expression &quot;garra charrúa&quot;&quot; (charrúan tenacity) is used to refer to victory in the face of certain defeat.

<text>&quot;Lenore&quot; is a poem by the American author Edgar Allan Poe. It began as a different poem, &quot;A Paean&quot;, and was not published as &quot;Lenore&quot; until 1843.

==Analysis ==
The poem discusses proper decorum in the wake of the death of a young woman, described as &quot;the queenliest dead that ever died so young&quot;. The poem concludes: &quot;No dirge shall I upraise,/ But waft the angel on her flight with a paean of old days!&quot; Lenore&#x27;s fiancé, Guy de Vere, finds it inappropriate to &quot;mourn&quot; the dead; rather, one should celebrate their ascension to a new world. Unlike most of Poe&#x27;s poems relating to dying women, &quot;Lenore&quot; implies the possibility of meeting in paradise.

The poem may have been Poe&#x27;s way of dealing with the illness of his wife Virginia. The dead woman&#x27;s name, however, may have been a reference to Poe&#x27;s recently dead brother, William Henry Leonard Poe. Poetically, the name Lenore emphasizes the letter &quot;L&quot; sound, a frequent device in Poe&#x27;s female characters including &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;, &quot;Eulalie&quot;, and &quot;Ulalume&quot;.

== Major themes ==
* Death of a beautiful woman (see also &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;, &quot;Eulalie&quot;, &quot;The Raven&quot;, &quot;Ulalume&quot;; in Poe&#x27;s short stories, see also &quot;Ligeia&quot;, Berenice&quot;, &quot;Eleonora&quot;, &quot;Morella&quot;).

== Publication history ==
The poem was first published as part of an early collection in 1831 under the title &quot;A Pæan&quot;. This early version was only 11 quatrains and the lines were spoken by a bereaved husband. The name &quot;Lenore&quot; was not included; it was not added until it was published as &quot;Lenore&quot; in February 1843 in &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, a periodical published by the poet and critic James Russell Lowell. Poe was paid $10 for this publication. The poem had many revisions in Poe&#x27;s lifetime. Its final form was published in the August 16, 1845, issue of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; while Poe was its editor.

The original version of the poem is so dissimilar from &quot;Lenore&quot; that it is often considered an entirely different poem. Both are usually collected separately in anthologies.

== Lenore in other works ==
* A character by the name of Lenore, thought to be a deceased wife, is central to Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; (1845).
* Roman Dirge created a comic book series in 1998 inspired by the poem, involving the comedic misadventures of &quot;Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl&quot;.
* Hikaru Utada&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;Kremlin Dusk&quot; makes a reference to Lenore, as well as other elements of Poe&#x27;s works, and even mentions Poe himself.

<text>Decorum (from the Latin: &quot;right, proper&quot;) was a principle of classical rhetoric, poetry, and theatrical theory concerning the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of &quot;decorum&quot; is also applied to prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within set situations.

==In rhetoric and poetry==
In classical rhetoric and poetic theory, decorum designates the appropriateness of style to subject. Both Aristotle (in, for example, his &quot;Poetics&quot;) and Horace (in his &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;) discussed the importance of appropriate style in epic, tragedy, comedy, etc. Horace says, for example: &quot;A comic subject is not susceptible of treatment in a tragic style, and similarly the banquet of Thyestes cannot be fitly described in the strains of everyday life or in those that approach the tone of comedy. Let each of these styles be kept to the role properly allotted to it.&quot;

Hellenistic and Latin rhetors divided style into the grand style, the middle style, and the low (or plain) style. Certain types of vocabulary and diction were considered appropriate for each stylistic register. A discussion of this division of styles was set out in the pseudo-Ciceronian &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;. Modeled on Virgil&#x27;s three-part literary career (&quot;Bucolics&quot;, &quot;Georgics&quot;, &quot;Aeneid&quot;), ancient, medieval, and Renaissance theorists often linked each style to a specific genre: epic (high style), didactic (middle style), and pastoral (plain style). In the Middle Ages, this concept was called &quot;Virgil&#x27;s wheel&quot;.

For stylistic purists, the mixing of styles within a work was considered inappropriate, and a consistent use of the high style was mandated for the epic. However, stylistic diversity had been a hallmark of classical epic (as seen in the inclusion of comic and/or erotic scenes in the epics of Virgil or Homer).
Poetry, perhaps more than any other literary form, usually expressed words or phrases that were not current in ordinary conversation, characterized as poetic diction.

With the arrival of Christianity, concepts of decorum became enmeshed with those of the sacred and profane in a different way than in the previous classical religions. Although in the Middle Ages religious subjects were often treated with broad humour in a &quot;low&quot; manner, especially in medieval drama, the churches policed carefully the treatment in more permanent art forms, insisting on a consistent &quot;high style&quot;. By the Renaissance the mixture of revived classical mythology and Christian subjects was also considered to fall under the heading of decorum, as was the trend of mixing religious subjects in art with lively genre painting or portraiture of the fashionable. The Catholic Council of Trent specifically forbade, among other things, the &quot;indecorous&quot; in religious art.

Concepts of decorum, increasingly sensed as inhibitive and stultifying, were aggressively attacked and deconstructed by writers of the Modernist movement, with the result that readers&#x27; expectations were no longer based on decorum, and in consequence the violations of decorum that underlie the wit of mock-heroic, of literary burlesque, and even a sense of bathos, were dulled in the twentieth-century reader.

==In theatre==
In continental European debates on theatre in the Renaissance and post-Renaissance, decorum concerns the appropriateness of certain actions or events to the stage. In their emulation of classical models and of the theoretical works by Aristotle and Horace (including the notion of the &quot;Three Unities&quot;), certain subjects were deemed to be better left to narration. In Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;, the poet (in addition to speaking about appropriate vocabulary and diction, as discussed above) counseled playwrights to respect decorum by avoiding the portrayal, on stage, of scenes that would shock the audience by their cruelty or unbelievable nature: &quot;But you will not bring on to the stage anything that ought properly to be taking place behinds the scenes, and you will keep out of sight many episodes that are to be described later by the eloquent tongue of a narrator. Medea must not butcher her children in the presence of the audience, nor the monstrous Atreus cook his dish of human flesh within public view, nor Procne be metamorphosed into a bird, nor Cadmus into a snake. I shall turn in disgust from anything of this kind that you show me.&quot;

In Renaissance Italy, important debates on decorum in theater were prompted by Sperone Speroni&#x27;s play &quot;Canace&quot; (portraying incest between a brother and sister) and Giovanni Battista Giraldi&#x27;s play &quot;Orbecche&quot; (involving patricide and cruel scenes of vengeance). In seventeenth-century France, the notion of decorum () was a key component of French classicism in both theater and the novel, as well as the visual arts.

==Social decorum==
&quot;Social&quot; decorum sets down appropriate social behavior and propriety, and is thus linked to notions of courtesy, decency, etiquette, grace, manners, respect, and seemliness.

The precepts of social decorum as we understand them, as the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by Lord Chesterfield, who was looking for a translation of : &quot;Manners are too little, morals are too much.&quot; The word decorum survives in Chesterfield&#x27;s severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century, prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by Roger Ascham, &quot;The Scholemaster&quot; (1570) and echoed in Malvolio&#x27;s tirade in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;My masters, are you mad, or what are you? Have you no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?... Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?&quot;

The place of decorum in the courtroom, of the type of argument that is within bounds, remains pertinent: the decorum of argument was a frequent topic during the O.J. Simpson trial.

During Model United Nations conferences the honorable chair may have to announce, &quot;Decorum delegates!&quot; if delegates are not adhering to parliamentary procedure dictated by the rules. This often happens if a delegate speaks out of turn or if the delegation is being disruptive.

<text>Dhule is one of the largest cities in Maharashtra, and central region of India. The city located in the Dhule District in the northwestern part of Maharashtra state, India known as West Khandesh. Situated on the banks of the Panzara River, Dhule is the regional headquarters of MIDC, Forest, Taapi River Fedreshan, RTO, and MTDC.

The city is mainly known for the Hindu temple of Adishakti Ekvira and Swaminarayan Temple. Dhule is also one of the important places for Jain Religion for a number of Jain Temples and Dharamshala are in the city.

The city, with industrial areas, schools, hospitals, and residential areas, has communications and transport infrastructures. Dhule is largely emerging as one of the upcoming hubs of textile, edible oil, Information Technology, and power-loom across the state and has gained a strategic advantage for being on the junction of three National Highways viz. NH-3, NH-6, and NH-211 and on most anticipated Manmad – Indore Rail Project.

==History==

Until the beginning of the 19th century, Dhule was an insignificant village, subordinate to Laling, the capital of the Laling or Fatehabad Subdivision. Under the rule of the Nizam, Laling was incorporated with the District of Daulatabad. The town passed successively through the hands of the Arab kings, the Mughals, and the Nizam, and into the power of the Peshwas about 1795. In 1803, it was completely deserted by its 
inhabitants on account of the ravages of Holkar and the terrible famine of that year. In the following year, Balaji Balwant, a dependant of the Vinchurkar, to whom the &quot;parganas&quot; of Laling and Songir had been granted by the Peshwa, repeopled the town and received from the Vinchurkar, in return for his services, a grant of &quot;inam&quot; land and other privileges. He was subsequently entrusted with the entire management of the territory of Songir and Laling, and fixed his headquarters at Dhule, where he continued to exercise authority till the occupation of the country by the British in 1818. Dhule was immediately chosen as the headquarters of the newly formed District of Khandesh by Captain John Briggs. In British Raj Britishers call it Dhulia.In January 1819, he obtained sanction for building public offices for the transaction of revenue and judicial business. Artificers were brought from distant places, and the buildings were erected at a total cost of £2700. Every encouragement was offered to traders and others to settle in the new town. Building sites were granted rent-free in perpetuity, and advances were made both to the old inhabitants and strangers to enable them to erect substantial houses. At this time, Captain Briggs described Dhule as a small town, surrounded by garden cultivation, and shut in between an irrigation channel and the river. The town was located on the southern bank of the Panzara River with an area of about one square mile. In 1819, the population numbered only 2509 persons, living in 401 houses. In 1863, there were 10,000 inhabitants; while by 1872 the number had further increased to 12,489, with 2620 houses. From the date of its occupation by the British, the progress of Dhule had been steady. Towards the end of the 19th century the town had already become a significant trading center due to the trade in cotton and linseed. Coarse cotton, woolen cloths and turbans were manufactured for local use around this time. In 1872, Dhule was visited by a severe flood, which did much damage to houses and property.

The Dhulia aka Dhule civil hospital was established in 1825 by the British government.

Dhule was a cantonment town, and in year 1881 had two hospitals, telegraph and post offices. In 1873–74 there were four Government schools, with 551 pupils. Historically, the town has been divided into New and Old Dhule. In the latter, the houses were irregularly built, the majority being of a very humble description.

==Etymology==

The Solapur (anciently called sonnalage) District was ruled by various dynasties such as Andhrabhratyas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas and Bahamanis. &#x27;Solapur&#x27; spelled in (Marathi: सोलापूर is believed to be derived from the combination of two words: Sola / सोला in Marathi means &quot;sixteen&quot; and &quot;Pura / पुर&quot; means &quot;village&quot;.

The present city of Solapur was considered to be spread over sixteen villages viz. Aadilpur, Ahmedpur, Chapaldev, Fatehpur, Jamdarwadi, Kalajapur, Khadarpur, Khandervkiwadi, Muhammadpur, Ranapur, Sandalpur, Shaikpur, Solapur, Sonallagi, Sonapur and Vaidakwadi and all these villages are now merged with Solapur Municipal Corporation.

The inscriptions of chief deity of Solapur Shivyogi Shri. Siddheshwar of the time of the Kalachuri (Basavakalyan) suggest that the town was called &quot;Sonnalage&quot; which came to be pronounced as &quot;Sonnalagi&quot;. A Sanskrit inscription dated Shake 1238, after the downfall of the Yadavas found at Kamati in Mohol shows that the town was known as Sonalipur. One of the inscriptions found in Solapur fort shows that the town was called Sonalpur. It was the main commercial hub of the Devagiri Yadavas and an important trading city. The town was known as Sonnalagi even up to the times of the Yadavas of Devagiri.

It is evident from the inscriptions of Shivayogi Lord Siddheshwar of the time of the Kalachuristis of Kalyani, that the town was called &#x27;Sonnalage&#x27;, an old Kannada name, which came to be pronounced as &#x27;Sonnalagi&#x27;. The town was known as Sonnalagi even up to the times of Yadavas. A Sanskrit inscription dated (Sanskrit:शके १२३८) Śakē 1238, after the downfall of the Yadavas found at Kamati in Mohol shows that the town was known as Sonalipur.

== History ==

One of the inscriptions found in Solapur fort shows that the town was called Sonalpur while another inscription on the well in the fort shows that it was known as Sandalpur. Subsequently, the British rulers pronounced Solapur as Solapur and hence the name of the district. The present Solapur district was previously part of Ahmednagar, Pune and Satara districts. In 1838 it became the Sub-district of Ahmednagar. It included Barshi, Mohol, Madha, Karmala, Indi, Hippargi and Muddebihal Sub-divisions. In 1864 this Sub-district was abolished. In 1871 this district was reformed joining the Sub-divisions viz. Solapur, Barshi, Mohol, Madha and Karmala and two Subdivisions of Satara district viz. Pandharpur, Sangola and in 1875 Malshiras Sub-division was also attached. After the State reorganisation in 1956 Solapur was included in Bombay State and it became a full-fledged district of Maharashtra State in 1960.

The municipal corporation building was built by Rao Saheb Mallappa Warad. He was also one of the first to bring the farming tractor to India. It was his wish that the building should be used for some public purpose and thus the building was made the municipal council. The building is also called &quot;Indra Bhawan&quot; which means &#x27;Abode of Indra&#x27; (Lord Indra). Mallappa Warad was also one of the ten members of &#x27;Chamber of Merchants&#x27; under Queen Victoria.

The Solapur Municipal Council was the first municipal council to hoist the indian national flag on the Municipal Council building in 1930. Taking the spirit of Dandi March from Mahatma Gandhi, the freedom fighters of Solapur hoisted the National Flag on 6 April 1930 on the Municipal Council building. This was the first and the unique incidence of such kind throughout the country.

During the Indian independence movement, the people of Solapur enjoyed full freedom on 9–11 May 1930. However, this resulted in the executions of Mallappa Dhanshetti, Abdul Rasool Qurban Hussein, Jagannath Bhagwan Shinde and Shrikisan Laxminarayan Sarada, who were hanged by the British Government on 12 January 1931, in the prison at Pune. This resulted in the city becoming recognized as &quot;The City of Hutatmas&quot; literally &quot;The City of Martyrs&quot;.
The Padmashalis are one of the largest communities in Solapur. The rise of Moghul rule and thereafter the Britishers who came to India for doing cloth business has had a lot of impact on weaving technology. The cloth manufactured at Birmingham, England can sell at cheaper rate in India and the qualities of their cloth were much better than our hand woven cloths on Gunta Maggam (Pit-loom). Since there is no buyer for our hand woven cloths, the domestic textile industry suffered losses. The Britisher established East India Company at Calcutta and spread their business across the India. They have also ruled our country till 1947. The impact of cloth business compelled Padmashalis to move to different places in India. Maharashtra is adjacent to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh; most of them started moving in search of their livelihood. Earlier days there were no transportation available; people started walking from Telangana and stayed for days together wherever in the en route to Mumbai. In this course some of them even settled in most parts of Maharashtra like Nanded, Jalna, Aurangabad, and Nasik, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Pune and even interior parts of the villages. Their
basic occupation was weaving; hence most of them have chosen weaving job in cotton mills. Gradually the strength has increased and it can be witnessed that about 400 to 500 Padmashalis could be seen in each mill in Mumbai. Most of the people in Solapur are started there Textile.

There is also one of the oldest Ganesh temples, Manacha Shri Ajoba Ganpati temple, which started celebrating the Ganesh festival from 1885.Lokmanya Tilak is inspired from this as peoples are coming and doing activities as a group, when he visited Solapur and then he started Ganesh Festival in Pune in 1893.

<text>José Roberto Pulido Jr. (born April 25, 1971), known professionally as Bobby Pulido, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor. He is acclaimed for pioneering the dissemination of Tejano music to a youthful audience, subsequently ascending as a teen idol and becoming one of the most influential Tejano recording artists among Mexican-American teenagers.

In 1995, Pulido debuted on the music scene as the frontman of his eponymous band. During the same year, he forged a recording contract with EMI Latin and released his debut album, &quot;Desvelado&quot;. It peaked at number nine on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart and at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum, denoting shipments of 100,000 units. The titular track propelled Pulido into a celebrated Tejano singer, albeit drawing criticism from veteran musicians who opined that his success in the genre derived from the preexisting musical impact of his father, Roberto Pulido. 

Pulido&#x27;s album &quot;Enséñame&quot; (1996), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart, garnered him a nomination for the Tejano Music Award for Male Entertainer of the Year and the Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican New Artist of the Year. In 1998, Pulido performed a sold-out performance at the Auditorio Coca-Cola in Monterrey, the first Tejano artist to achieve this feat. Pulido became the youngest honoree to receive the Orgullo de la Frontera accolade by the Fiestas Mexicanas in February 1999. In 1998, the singer was awarded the Male Entertainer of the Year at the Tejano Music Awards for three consecutive years. By 2000, the waning popularity of Tejano music resulted in Pulido&#x27;s subsequent albums failing to make an impact on music charts. 

In 2003, Pulido made his acting debut, assuming the lead role in the made-for-television film &quot;La Decada Furiosa&quot;. He also appeared in the telenovelas &quot;Fuego en La Sangre&quot; and &quot;Qué pobres tan ricos&quot;. Pulido encountered commercial disappointment with his album &quot;Enfermo de Amor&quot; (2007), prompting a three-year hiatus, he resurfaced with the release of &quot;Dias de Ayer&quot; (2010). Concurrently, Pulido renewed his foray into acting, appearing in the film &quot;Noches Con Platanito&quot;. In 2024, Pulido unveiled his intention to embark on a farewell tour, culminating in a bid for public office in Texas.

== Life and career ==

=== 1971–1994: Early life and career beginnings ===
Jose Roberto Pulido Jr. was born on April 25, 1971, in Edinburg, Texas. He is the oldest child of Roberto Pulido, an award-winning Tejano music singer; and Diana Montez, daughter of norteño musician Mario Montez of Los Donneños. Known professionally as Bobby Pulido, he attended Edinburg High School and became a member of the school&#x27;s mariachi ensemble before embarking on a journey with his father&#x27;s band, Los Clásicos, where he contributed as a saxophonist and backup vocalist. In 1994, EMI Latin unveiled a compilation album titled &quot;Branding Icons&quot;, that showcased Pulido&#x27;s collaborative effort with his father on &quot;Contigo&quot;. Pulido was accepted at St. Mary&#x27;s University, where he pursued a major in business management. Following the album&#x27;s release, Pulido abandoned his collegiate pursuits and venture into a singing career during the golden age of Tejano music.

=== 1995–1999: Debut album and commercial success ===
Pulido spearheaded the establishment of his own band, enlisting guitarist Gilbert Trejo, bassist Mike Fox, drummer and uncle Jimmy Montez, keyboardist Rey Gutierrez, and Frank Caballero, who assumed the role of the band&#x27;s accordion virtuoso. Initially, Pulido encountered censure from Tejano musicians, who contended that the vocalist was capitalizing on the prestige amassed by his father&#x27;s well-established musical career. In May 1995, Pulido inked a recording agreement with EMI Latin, culminating in the release of his debut album, &quot;Desvelado&quot;, that September. President of EMI Latin, Jose Behar, shared with &quot;Billboard&quot; his ardent optimism for the singer&#x27;s propects within the country music market. His debut single &quot;No Se Por Que&quot; peaked at number 33 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart in December 1995. Debuting at number 44 on the Top Latin Albums, &quot;Desvelado&quot; propelled Pulido&#x27;s eponymous title track, where it peaked at number 21, establishing Pulido as one of the most popular Tejano artists. In April 1996, the album peaked at number nine on the Top Latin Albums chart and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s John Lannert, lauded Pulido&#x27;s chart placement as &quot;impressive&quot;, hailing the singer as a &quot;fast-rising artist&quot;. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of 100,000 units in the US. Pulido ended 1996 as the eighth best-selling regional Mexican artist and &quot;Desvelado&quot; ended the year as the eleventh best-selling regional Mexican album. The album reached sales of 100,000 units by the end of 1999. At the 1996 Tejano Music Awards, Pulido tied first place with Eddie Gonzales for Best New Rising Male Tejano Artists.

In July 1996, Pulido married Eliza Anzaldua, prompting a brief hiatus from his career. Pulido persisted in the promotion of his second album, &quot;Enséñame&quot;, which was released a month following his marriage. &quot;Billboard&quot;, recognizing the essence of &quot;Enséñame&quot; as a resounding ranchera album infused with catchy cumbia undertones, surmised that Pulido aimed to emulate Emilio Navaira, who sought to crossover and establish himself as a country music singer. Writing in the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, Ramiro Burr affirmed that Pulido&#x27;s vocals had undergone significant refinement compared to the preceding recordings. &quot;Enséñame&quot; peaked at number ten on the Top Latin Albums and number two on the Regional Mexican Albums charts. The album generated three Regional Mexican Airplay tracks that secured spots within the top 20; &quot;Enséñame&quot;, &quot;Se Murió De Amor&quot;, and &quot;La Rosa&quot;. The album earned Pulido a nomination for the Tejano Music Award for Male Entertainer of the Year and the Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican New Artist of the Year. In collaboration with Graciela Beltrán, the Barrio Boyzz, Emilio Navaira, Pete Astudillo, and Jennifer Peña, Pulido contributed to the rendition of &quot;Viviras Selena&quot; for the 1997 soundtrack to the biopic film about Selena, referred to as the &quot;Queen of Tejano Music&quot; who was shot and killed in March 1995. By 1997, Pulido had gained recognition for his role in introducing Tejano music to a younger demographic in the US.

In 1998, Pulido released his third studio album &quot;Llegaste a Mi Vida&quot;, where it peaked at number two on the Regional Mexican Albums chart and at number eleven on the Top Latin Albums chart. The only single to appear on the Latin singles chart, &quot;Pedire&quot;, peaked at number 28 on the Hot Latin Songs. &quot;Llegaste a Mi Vida&quot; garnered Pulido five of twelve nominations at the 1998 Tejano Music Awards; winning Male Vocalist of the Year, Male Entertainer of the Year, Tejano Crossover Song of the Year for &quot;¿Dónde Estás?&quot;, and Tejano Album of the Year. The same year, &quot;Desvelado&quot; and &quot;Llegaste a Mi Vida&quot;, each sold 100,000 units in Mexico—an unprecedented milestone for the singer. In September 1998, Pulido released his first live album &quot;En Vivo: Desde Monterrey Mexico&quot;, which was recorded on April 24, 1998. The album became the singer&#x27;s fourth top-ten US recording and peaked at number 21 on the Top Latin Albums chart. Performing at a sold-out concert at the Auditorio Coca-Cola in Monterrey, Pulido became the first Tejano &quot;grupo&quot; musician to accomplish this feat. In March 1999, he released his fourth studio album &quot;El Cazador&quot;, which produced the top-thirty Regional Mexican Airplay single &quot;Cantarle a Ella&quot;. Pulido became the youngest recipient to be awarded the Orgullo de la Frontera from the Fiestas Mexicanas in February 1999. In an April 1999 interview, Pulido expressed interest in recording a Latin pop album, resolutely asserting his disinterest in crossover over and recording English-language albums.

=== 2000–2009: Decline in popularity, acting debut, and hiatus ===
By 2000, Tejano music&#x27;s popularity continued to wane, despite music critics&#x27; projections that the genre would recover by this time. Critics observed the dominance of more established Tejano singers like Navaira, Selena, Mazz, Michael Salgado, and Pulido on the airwaves of the US, where older generations of singers were not able to compete. Pulido became a teen idol among Mexican American teenage girls and one of the most influential Tejano recording artists in the same demographic. In March 2000, Pulido released &quot;Zona de Peligro&quot;, though it failed to match the singer&#x27;s previous work&#x27;s commercial success. None of its singles were commercially successful, though Pulido won the Tejano Music Award for Male Entertainer of the Year—his third consecutive win. According to musicologist Guadalupe San Miguel, Tejano musicians in the late 20th century and the early 21st century rendered their individuality indiscernible. Pulido released his sixth studio album, &quot;Siempre Pensando En Ti&quot;, in March 2001; it fared less commercially successful, peaking at number 50 on the Top Latin Albums chart. The album marked Pulido&#x27;s final recording to impact a music chart on &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2002, Pulido orchestrated the Celebrity Golf Classic, a philanthropic endeavor that raised $50,000 (2002 USD) for the Easter Seals program. McAllen Mayor Leo Montalvo announced at the event that November 2, 2002, would be &quot;Bobby Pulido Day&quot;.

Pulido released his eponymous album, &quot;Bobby&quot;, which spawned the top 40 US single &quot;Vanidosa&quot;. He recorded a cover version of Mexican singer Juan Gabriel&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Se Me Olvidó Otra Vez&quot; for &quot;Bobby&quot;. His following albums, &quot;Montame&quot; (2003) and &quot;Vive&quot; (2005), failed to chart, ending his eight-year presence on &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2003, Pulido made his acting debut in the telenovela television movie &quot;La Decada Furiosa&quot;, in which he played himself. Two years later, he appeared as a guest on the reality television show &quot;Big Brother México&quot;. Pulido performed and recorded &quot;Ya Ves&quot; for the live televised benefit concert, &quot;Selena ¡VIVE!&quot;, in April 2005. His following album, &quot;Enfermo de Amor&quot;, was released in August 2007. AllMusic&#x27;s Evan Gutierrez complimented Pulido&#x27;s use of mixing genres without &quot;[pushing] the envelope very far&quot;, and said the album &quot;sound[s] fresh rather than repetitive&quot;, though found it lacking in production quality. He called the title track and &quot;Una Más&quot; a roots rock recording, and &quot;Desvelado Acústico&quot; a &quot;sophisticated acoustic&quot; Latin pop track. After the album&#x27;s release, Pulido guest starred in three episodes of the telenovela series &quot;Fuego en La Sangre&quot; as himself.

=== 2010–2024: Return to music and acting ===

Pulido returned to recording music in 2010 and released &quot;Dias de Ayer&quot; in March. It earned Pulido a nomination for the Tejano Music Award for Male Vocalist of the Year; the first time since 2003. Two years later, he released &quot;Lo Mio&quot;, his first album on Apodaca Records. In 2013, Pulido recorded with former Aventura vocalist Henry Santos on Santos&#x27; song &quot;No Sé Vivir Sin Tí&quot;. Pulido returned to acting and guest starred as himself in two episodes of the telenovela &quot;Noches Con Platanito&quot; (2013–15). In 2014, he landed a regular, minor role as himself in the telenovela &quot;Qué pobres tan ricos&quot;. In November 2015, Pulido released &quot;No Es Como Tú&quot;, a track from his twelfth studio album, &quot;Hoy&quot;. The album is Pulido&#x27;s first as sole songwriter for any of his albums. Pulido told the Mexican newspaper &quot;Publimentero&quot; that &quot;Hoy&quot; will be released as a strategic plan to &quot;help fight the war&quot; on physical music consumption; he is against the digital age of downloading and music streaming in the popular market. The album was expected to be released only through Pulido&#x27;s social networking sites to combat piracy. In a May 2016 concert, Pulido performed &quot;Si No Te Hubiera Conocido&quot;, a song he recorded with Miguel Luna that was shelved and forgotten during his career. At the 2022 Latin Grammy Awards, Pulido won Best Tejano Album for his album, &quot;Para Que Baile Mi Pueblo&quot; (2021).

In November 2024, Pulido announced his retirement from music to pursue a career in politics after a farewell tour starting in January 2025.

== Personal life ==
Pulido married Eliza Anzaldua in July 1996. They had three sons; Remy Pulido (born 1996), Darian Pulido (born 1998), and Trey Pulido (born 2005). However, Pulido filed for divorce in September 2013, after 17 years of marriage and four months of separation. He married Mariana Morales in November 2018 and his fourth son Rodrigo Pulido was born in December 2019.

<text>Aurangabad (), officially known as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,  is a city in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is the administrative headquarters of Aurangabad district, Maharashtra and is the largest city in the Marathwada region. Located on a hilly upland terrain in the Deccan Traps, Aurangabad is the fifth-most populous urban area in Maharashtra after Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik with a population of 1,175,116. The city is known as a major production center of cotton textile and artistic silk fabrics. Several prominent educational institutions, including Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, are located in the city. The city is also a popular tourism hub, with tourist destinations like the Ajanta and Ellora caves lying on its outskirts, both of which have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1983. Other tourist attractions include the Aurangabad Caves, Devagiri Fort, Grishneshwar Temple, Jama Mosque, Bibi Ka Maqbara, Himayat Bagh, Panchakki and Salim Ali Lake. Historically, there were 52 Gates in Aurangabad, some of them extant, because of which Aurangabad is nicknamed as the &quot;City of Gates&quot;. In 2019, the Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC) became the first greenfield industrial smart city of India under the country&#x27;s flagship Smart Cities Mission.

Paithan, the imperial capital of the Satavahana dynasty (1st century BCE–2nd century CE), as well as &quot;Dēvagirī&quot;, the capital of the Yadava dynasty (9th century CE–14th century CE), are located within the limits of modern Aurangabad. In 1308, the region was annexed by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of Sultan Alauddin Khalji. In 1327, the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted from Delhi to Daulatabad (in present-day Aurangabad) during the rule of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq, who ordered the mass migration of Delhi&#x27;s population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital was shifted back to Delhi thereafter. In 1499, Daulatabad became a part of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. In 1610, a new city named &quot;Khaḍkī&quot; was established at the location of modern Aurangabad to serve as the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the Ethiopian military leader Malik Ambar, who was brought to India as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Malik Ambar was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of the city to &quot;Fatehnagar&quot;. In 1636, Aurangzeb, who was then the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan region, annexed the city into the Mughal Empire. In 1653, Aurangzeb renamed the city as &quot;Aurangabad&quot; and made it the capital of the Deccan region of the Mughal Empire. In 1724, the Mughal governor of the Deccan, Nizam Asaf Jah I, seceded from the Mughal Empire and founded his own Asaf Jahi dynasty. The dynasty established the State of Hyderabad with their capital initially at Aurangabad, until they transferred their capital to the city of Hyderabad in 1763. Hyderabad State became a princely state during the British Raj and remained so for 150 years (1798–1948). Until 1956, Aurangabad remained part of Hyderabad State. In 1960, Aurangabad and the larger Marathi-speaking Marathwada region became a part of the state of Maharashtra.

==History==

&quot;Khaḍkī&quot; was the original name of the village which was made a capital city by Malik Ambar, the Prime Minister of Murtaza Nizam Shah II, Sultan of Ahmednagar. Within a decade, &quot;Khaḍkī&quot; grew into a populous and imposing city. Malik Ambar died in 1626. He was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of &quot;Khaḍkī&quot; to &quot;Fatehnagar&quot;. With the capture of Devagiri Fort by the imperial troops in 1633, the Nizam Shahi dominions, including &quot;Fatehnagar&quot;, came under the possession of the Mughals.

In 1653, when Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed the Viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, he made Fatehnagar his capital and renamed it Aurangabad. Aurangabad is sometimes referred to as Khujista Bunyad by the chroniclers of Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign.

In 1667 Muazzam, son of Aurangzeb became governor of this province. Before him Mirza Raja Jai Singh was in-charge of this province for some time.

In 1681, after Aurangzeb&#x27;s coronation as emperor, he shifted his court from the capital city of Delhi to Aurangabad in order to conduct his military campaigns in the Deccan. The presence of Mughal elites in the city led to urban development, as numerous public and private buildings were constructed. Aurangabad had a city wall built encircling it around 1683 in response to Maratha raids, of which several gates still stand, such as the Delhi Gate. Though Aurangzeb chose not to reside in the city after 1684, the city retained importance as the primary military outpost of the Mughal Deccan, attracting wealth and turning Aurangabad into a centre of trade; the manufacture of embroidered silks emerged during this period and is still practised in Aurangabad today. Mughal Aurangabad was also a cultural hub, serving as an important centre of Persian and Urdu literature. During the Mughal era, Aurangabad had an estimated population of 200,000 people, living in 54 suburbs.

In 1724, Asaf Jah, a Mughal general and Nizam al-Mulk in the Deccan region, decided to secede from the crumbling Mughal Empire, with the intention of founding his own dynasty in the Deccan. Aurangabad continued to be politically and culturally significant for the next 40 years as capital of Asaf Jah&#x27;s new dominion, until his son and successor Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah II transferred the capital to Hyderabad in 1763. The loss of Aurangabad&#x27;s privileged position led to a period of economic decline; by the beginning of the 19th century, the city had become notably underpopulated, leading to the crippling of its administration, and its buildings were in decay. However, Aurangabad would continue to be important as the &quot;second city&quot; of the Nizam&#x27;s dominions for the remainder of the polity&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1816, the British established a cantonment outside Aurangabad (as they did in other parts of the Nizam&#x27;s dominions), but were discouraged from entering the city proper by the Nizam&#x27;s officials. As a princely state under British suzerainty, the Nizam&#x27;s Hyderabad State was quasi-autonomous, meaning that Aurangabad&#x27;s culture was somewhat free of colonial influence.

Aurangabad began to industrialise in the late 19th century, with the city&#x27;s first cotton mill being opened in 1889. The population of the city was 30,000 in 1881, growing to 36,000 over the next two decades. Aurangabad was particularly affected by Deccan famines in 1899-1900, 1918, and 1920, causing surges in crime.

Following Indian independence, Hyderabad State was annexed into the Indian Union in 1948, and consequently Aurangabad became a part of the Indian Union&#x27;s Hyderabad State. In 1956, it passed into the newly formed bilingual Bombay State, and in 1960 it became a part of Maharashtra state.

Bal Thackeray in 1988 proposed the city to be renamed as Sambhajinagar. The local governing body i.e., City Corporation passed a resolution on name change in 1995. On 29 June 2022, the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra cabinet approved the renaming of Aurangabad to Sambhaji Nagar, after Sambhaji Bhosale, second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.

===Geology===

The entire area is covered by the Deccan Traps lava flows of Upper Cretaceous to Lower Eocene age. The lava flows are overlain by thin alluvial deposits along the Kham and Sukhana river. The basaltic lava flows belonging to the Deccan Trap is the only major geological formation occurring in Aurangabad. The lava flows are horizontal and each flow has two distinct units. The upper layers consist of vesiculara and amygdaloidal zeolitic basalt while the bottom layer consists of massive basalt. The lava flows are individually different in their ability to receive as well as hold water in storage and to transmit it. The difference in the productivity of groundwater in various flows arises as a result of their inherent physical properties such as porosity and permeability. The groundwater occurs under water table conditions and is mainly controlled by the extent of its secondary porosity i.e. thickness of weathered rocks and spacing of joints and fractures. The highly weathered vesicular trap and underlying weathered jointed and fractured massive trap constitutes the main water-yielding zones. The soil is mostly formed from igneous rocks and is black, medium black, shallow and calcareous types having different depths and profiles.

<text>Richard Shindell (born August 3, 1960) is an American folk singer, songwriter, producer, and musician. Shindell grew up in Port Washington, New York, and now lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his wife, Lila Caimari, a university professor, and their children.

Shindell&#x27;s career received a boost in 1997 when Joan Baez recorded three of his songs (&quot;Fishing&quot;, &quot;Reunion Hill&quot;, and &quot;Money for Floods&quot;) for her album &quot;Gone from Danger&quot; and invited the aspiring singer-songwriter to join her 1997–98 tour.

Shindell collaborated with Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky to form the group Cry Cry Cry. On their eponymous 1998 album, Cry Cry Cry covered an eclectic mix of songwriters. The trio toured in support of their album before resuming solo careers. In 2017-2018 the group reunited briefly. The resulting tour culminated in a live recording of their final show on April 15, 2018, at The Freight and Salvage in Berkeley, CA, all proceeds of which went to support Live Music Society.

A recording of cover songs, &quot;South of Delia&quot;, was released on Shindell&#x27;s website in March 2007. An album of original material, &quot;Not Far Now,&quot; appeared in 2009. &quot;13 Songs You May Or May Not Have Heard Before,&quot; a compilation of reworked previous releases and some new material, followed in 2011. &quot;Careless&quot;, his most recent recording, was released in September 2016.

Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky reunited to collaborate on a new album of cover songs, &quot;Tomorrow You&#x27;re Going&quot;, funded through Kickstarter, and released in March 2015 under the name Pine Hill Project.

In October 2019, Shindell announced that he would cease touring in order to pursue other projects.

Shindell&#x27;s songs and songwriting style often involves storytelling from a first-person point of view: an INS officer and illegal immigrant in &quot;Fishing&quot;, a World War II soldier in &quot;Sparrows Point&quot;, a Confederate drummer boy in &quot;Arrowhead&quot;, an Argentine grandmother in &quot;Abuelita&quot;, and a power broker in &quot;Confession&quot;. His other personae include a New York City cab driver in &quot;The Last Fare of the Day&quot;, a man on death row in &quot;Ascent&quot;, a war widow in &quot;Reunion Hill&quot;, and Mary Magdalene.

<doc id="546034" wikidata="Q5225434" url="?curid=546034" title="Darryl Purpose">
<text>Darryl Purpose is an American singer-songwriter, known for his narrative (often very personal) lyrics and fingerstyle guitar. Before becoming a professional musician, Purpose was a professional blackjack player and was known as one of the best in the world. In 2010 Purpose was inducted into the Blackjack Hall of Fame. &quot;Purpose has the voice of James Taylor, the brains of Bob Dylan, and the soul of Willie Nelson&quot;.

In 1986, Purpose walked across the United States with The Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament and then a year later in the former Soviet Union. In 1996, he became a &quot;full-time national touring singer-songwriter&quot; who &quot;hit the folk scene...with an unusually eclectic resume that provided him with a wealth of compelling stories to tell.&quot; As of December 2011, Purpose has returned to touring full-time, returning from an unexplained seven-year hiatus.

When Darryl Purpose was 16 years old, his mother put a book called &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot; in his Christmas stocking. He went to Las Vegas as a teenager and began a career as professional card player – and still calls this the &quot;only real job I’ve ever had.&quot; Years later, he took time off to walk across the country for peace, and fell in with a bad crowd – musicians and peaceniks. In 1996, inspired by his work with a traveling band of musical activists, Purpose began to tour nationally as a solo singer-songwriter. Eight years, six CDs and a thousand-plus shows later, he was headlining venues like the Freight and Salvage, Club Passim, McCabe&#x27;s, The Bluebird Cafe, The Kennedy Center, and the Kerrville Folk Festival Main Stage.
In 2005, he inexplicably set down his guitar and took a seven-year sabbatical in the Rocky Mountains. During this time, he shepherded the release of &quot;Singer-Songwriter Heaven: the songs of Kevin Faherty.&quot; He also continued to co-captain the Second Strings Project, which is responsible for delivering over twenty thousand sets of guitar strings to those who need them all around the world. In 2009, he was inducted into the Blackjack Hall of Fame, one of 17 members, including Ed Thorp, the man who wrote that book that his mother put into his Christmas stocking at 16. He says that he also “got healthy, in multiple ways.”
2012 saw Purpose record his first CD of original material in 10 years – &quot;Next Time Around,&quot; produced by Billy Crockett for the Blue Rock Artists label. With no formal radio promotion, the CD spent five weeks at #1 on the Roots Music Report folk chart for national radio airplay in March and April 2013.

==Outreach==
While in the former Soviet Union, Purpose took note of the many talented musicians playing instruments that were unfit for their level of expertise and left several guitars with them. Later, in El Salvador, he witnessed how the people would alter guitars that were falling apart to still be able to play music. To the end of assisting struggling musicians across the globe, Purpose and Kevin Deame announced the beginning of The Second Strings Project in 1999. They collect used guitar strings from artists in the United States and distribute them to needy musicians around the world.

==Collaboration==
Purpose has co-written songs with a handful of fellow songwriters, including short story writer and author Robert Morgan Fisher, as well as the author-songwriter-photographer Paul Zollo, with whom Purpose has written many songs, including &quot;The Ghost of Crazy Horse,&quot; &quot;Baltimore,&quot; which details the mysterious death of Edgar Allan Poe, &quot;Koreatown,&quot; and &quot;Crooked Line,&quot; which tells the story of Chavez Ravine, and was the title song of Purpose&#x27;s 2001 album. Their song &quot;California (Rutherford Hayes in the Morning)&quot; tells the story of this mostly forgotten president, the first to ever travel to California. For Purpose&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Next Time Around, &quot;they wrote songs, including &quot;Dreams of Life&quot; and &quot;Orange Raincoat.&quot;

<doc id="546037" wikidata="Q1501951" url="?curid=546037" title="New Model Army (band)">
<text>New Model Army are an English rock band formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 1980 by lead vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Justin Sullivan, bassist Stuart Morrow and drummer Phil Tompkins. Sullivan has been the only continuous member of the band, which has seen numerous line-up changes in its four-decade history. Their music draws on influences across the musical spectrum, from punk and folk to soul, metal and classical. Sullivan&#x27;s lyrics, which range from directly political through to spiritual and personal, have always been considered as a key part of the band&#x27;s appeal.

Whilst having their roots in punk rock, the band have always been difficult to categorise. In 1999, when asked about this, Sullivan said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been labelled as punks, post-punks, Goth, metal, folk – the lot, but we&#x27;ve always been beyond those style confines&quot;. Following a large turnover of personnel, both permanent and as touring members, as of 2024 New Model Army comprise Sullivan, Dean White (keyboards and guitar), Michael Dean (drums) and Ceri Monger (bass).

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Vengeance&quot; (1980–1984)===

The band were formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire in the autumn of 1980, taking their name from the standing army formed in 1645 by the Parliamentarians during the First English Civil War, and played their first concert in Bradford in October of that year, playing songs based on their shared love of punk rock and Northern soul.

After a few months in the band, original drummer Phil Tompkins lost interest and quit, to be replaced by Rob Waddington. By the time they began making their first records in 1983, Robert Heaton, a former drum technician for space rock band Hawkwind, had replaced Waddington.

Until the mid-1980s, Sullivan used the alter ego of &quot;Slade the Leveller&quot; (Levellers being a radical political movement of the 1640s), supposedly so that he would not lose his unemployment benefits if the authorities realized he was making money from music. They continued to gig around the United Kingdom with little recognition, but in 1983 released their first singles &quot;Bittersweet&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; on Abstract Records, and were given airplay by BBC Radio 1&#x27;s disc jockey (DJ) and radio presenter John Peel.

In February 1984, they were invited to play on popular music television programme &quot;The Tube&quot;, being introduced by Scottish host Muriel Gray as &quot;the ugliest band in rock and roll&quot;. The producers of the show however were concerned about the lyrics of &quot;Vengeance&quot;, which the band were due to perform (&quot;I believe in justice / I believe in vengeance / I believe in getting the bastards&quot;) and so the band played &quot;Christian Militia&quot; instead.

Following this performance, the band&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Vengeance&quot; reached Number 1 in the UK independent chart in early 1984, pushing the Smiths from that position. After a further single &quot;The Price&quot; also reached a high placing in the independent charts, the band signed a recording contract with major label EMI.

===The major label years (1985–1993)===
The band then made four studio albums (plus a live album) for EMI and one studio album for Epic Records, in a period of eight years. 1985&#x27;s &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; and associated single &quot;No Rest&quot; both made the mainstream top 30 in the UK, the latter leading to some controversy when the band sported T-shirts with the phrase &quot;Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin&quot; during an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. During the &quot;No Rest&quot; tour, bassist Stuart Morrow left the band, and was replaced by 17-year-old Jason &quot;Moose&quot; Harris. However the band were refused work permits to enter the United States, as the US Immigration Department had said the band&#x27;s work was of &quot;no artistic merit&quot;.
In December 1986, the band finally got permission to tour in the US. By this time &quot;The Ghost of Cain&quot;, produced by Glyn Johns, had been released, and was named best album of the year for 1986 in &quot;The Times&quot; by David Sinclair, who said that it &quot;was the best thing to happen to English rock music since the first Clash album&quot;. Concerts included the Reading Festival and a gig with David Bowie in front of the Reichstag in Berlin, and the band for the first time expanded their touring line-up to include a second guitarist in the shape of Ricky Warwick, as well as harmonica player Mark Feltham from blues band Nine Below Zero.

&quot;Thunder and Consolation&quot; was released in February 1989, and saw the band moving towards a more folk rock sound, especially on the tracks including violinist Ed Alleyne-Johnson. Described as the band&#x27;s &quot;landmark&quot; album, it reached number 20 in the UK charts, the singles &quot;Stupid Questions&quot; and &quot;Vagabonds&quot; making an impression in America, and the band was able to tour the album there with Alleyne-Johnson also providing additional guitar and keyboards. At the end of the year however, Harris left the band, to be replaced by Peter &quot;Nelson&quot; Nice, who would play with the band for more than 20 years. 1990&#x27;s &quot;Impurity&quot; continued the folk-driven theme with Alleyne-Johnson still to the fore and Adrian Portas joining the band on guitar.

The next studio album was to be a musical change of direction; as Sullivan later said, &quot;just as this folk-cum-rave-cum-crusty-cum-new-age thing broke and became big in the early 1990s, we went – whoosh – done that – and went and made a very angry hard rock album&quot;. &quot;The Love of Hopeless Causes&quot;, New Model Army&#x27;s only release on Epic Records, appeared in 1993 and led with the single &quot;Here Comes the War&quot;, which spawned controversy when it came packaged with instructions on how to construct a nuclear weapon.

===Hiatus and return to independence (1994–2000)===
The band had previously decided to take a year out to concentrate on personal and other musical issues, and reconvened in late 1994 with Dean White, playing keyboards and guitar, replacing Alleyne-Johnson. It became clear that all was not well between Sullivan and Heaton; Sullivan later said, &quot;We wrote &quot;Thunder and Consolation&quot; and it was brilliant, but very shortly after that, we started falling out, which went on during the making of that album. His life went in one direction and mine went in another&quot;. It was agreed that they would go their separate ways after the forthcoming studio album and tour. &quot;Strange Brotherhood&quot; was released on 13 April 1998 to mixed reviews, but then Heaton was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He suggested that his drum technician Michael Dean take over from him to tour the album. By this time the band had formed their own independent label, Attack Attack, and former tour manager Tommy Tee had returned to manage the band. A live album &quot;...&amp; Nobody Else&quot; followed in 1999, and their eighth studio album &quot;Eight&quot; in 2000.

===Death of Robert Heaton, and &quot;Carnival&quot; to &quot;Today is a Good Day&quot; (2001–2009)===

After touring &quot;Eight&quot; (2000), the band again took time out, most notably so that Sullivan could concentrate on his debut solo studio album &quot;Navigating by the Stars&quot; which was eventually released in 2003, and toured by Sullivan, Dean and White. As the band got together to record their ninth studio album, Robert Heaton died from pancreatic cancer on 4 November 2004. &quot;Carnival&quot; was finally released in September 2005, and includes Sullivan&#x27;s reaction to Heaton&#x27;s death, &quot;Fireworks Night&quot;. Dave Blomberg was unable to take part in touring the album, and was replaced by guitarist Marshall Gill.

The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;High&quot;, was produced relatively quickly and was released in August 2007. The tour suffered a slight setback when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services again denied the band visas; this time the issue was relatively quickly resolved and the dates rescheduled for early 2008. Soon afterwards, the band was again shaken as manager Tommy Tee died unexpectedly at the age of 46. By 2009, though, the band were again back in the studio. &quot;Today Is a Good Day&quot; was a far more uncompromising album, the heavy rock title track and others directly referencing the stock market crash of 2008.

===30th anniversary to &quot;Winter&quot; (2010–2018)===

Towards the end of 2010, the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary was celebrated with special shows across four continents every weekend from September until early December; in most cities, the shows were across two nights with completely different sets, the band having promised to play at least four songs from each of their eleven studio albums plus &quot;Lost Songs&quot; (2002) and &quot;B-Sides and Abandoned Tracks&quot; (1994), their rarities and B-sides collections. The final shows at the Forum Kentish Town in London were collected on a double CD and DVD release containing all 58 songs played over the nights of 3 and 4 December.

After the band had played their traditional Christmas shows the following year, the news was released that Nelson had decided to leave the band for personal reasons, a decision that had been taken some time before. A few days later, on Christmas Eve, a fire destroyed the band&#x27;s recording studio and rehearsal space in Bradford. Numerous guitars and other instruments were lost along with recording equipment and memorabilia. However, the studio was back in operation within three months, and after a number of auditions, Ceri Monger was announced as the band&#x27;s new bassist and multi-instrumentalist.

In 2013, the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Between Dog and Wolf&quot;, mixed by Joe Barresi, was released and became the band&#x27;s most successful since &quot;The Love of Hopeless Causes&quot; (1993) 20 years earlier. The album showed a marked shift away from the band&#x27;s traditional sounds, including rhythms that were described as &quot;tribal&quot;, though Sullivan claimed they were merely different ways of using drums – &quot;We really like complex tom-tom rhythms, we really like that pounding (beat)&quot;. A year later, &quot;Between Wine and Blood&quot; (2014) was released, including six previously unreleased studio tracks from the &quot;Between Dog and Wolf&quot; (2013) sessions, along with eleven live tracks from that album. In October 2014, a documentary feature film about the band&#x27;s career, &quot;Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story&quot; by director Matt Reid premiered at the Raindance Film Festival in London and the Festival du nouveau cinéma in Montreal. The band&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Winter&quot;, was released on 26 August 2016. &quot;Winter&quot; was named the #1 album of 2016 by The Big Takeover.

===&quot;From Here&quot; and 40th anniversary (2019–2023)===

On 23 August 2019, the band&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;From Here&quot;, was released. The band had intended to play a number of shows for their 40th anniversary in 2020, but these were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They did however play an online show on 23 October to mark the exact 40th anniversary of their first show. 

They finally played the 40th anniversary shows towards the end of 2021, although guitarist Marshall Gill was absent for these and the early 2022 shows, the band reverting to a four-piece line-up with Dean White predominantly playing guitar as well as keyboards. On 11 November 2022, Gill indicated in a Facebook post that he had been dropped from the band for refusing a COVID-19 vaccine; at the end of 2021 performers still required proof of vaccination to play in a number of countries that the band were visiting.

===&quot;Unbroken&quot; (2023–present)===
The band released album a live album, &quot;Sinfonia&quot; in September 2023; it was recorded with the Sinfonia Leipzig Orchestra at the Tempodrom venue in Berlin on 15 July 2022. The band&#x27;s sixteenth studio album, &quot;Unbroken&quot;, was recorded in 2023 and released on 26 January 2024. The band toured the album in early 2024, with Nguyen Green on keyboards enabling Dean White to play guitar on those songs requiring two instruments. A tour later in the year was postponed until 2025 due to medical issues with drummer Michael Dean.

===Timeline of major contributors===
This is a list of musicians who were (or currently have been) a permanent – not touring – member of the band for a significant amount of time. 
==&quot;The Family&quot;==
Over the years, New Model Army have gathered a wide selection of fans, many of whom dedicatedly follow the band. Originally calling themselves &quot;The Militia&quot;, after the song &quot;Christian Militia&quot;, they later universally adopted the term &quot;The Family&quot; for their multi-generational and gendered group. Joolz Denby, long-time collaborator of Sullivan and the band&#x27;s main artist has referred to the Family as &quot;not a formal, contrived organisation, but a spontaneous sense of fellowship that has developed over the years&quot;, whilst elsewhere it has been described as &quot;sanctuary ... and acceptance&quot;.

==Influences==
Frequently noted for their musical lyricism, Justin Sullivan has noted in interviews that some of the band&#x27;s (and his own) lyrical inspiration has come from Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Gillian Welch, Joni Mitchell, and Bob Dylan, as well as &quot;lots of country and hip-hop artists, all for their precision and poetry.&quot;

<doc id="546039" wikidata="Q2395230" url="?curid=546039" title="Syntax (logic)">
<text>In logic, syntax is anything having to do with formal languages or formal systems without regard to any interpretation or meaning given to them. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the semantics of a language which is concerned with its meaning.

The symbols, formulas, systems, theorems and proofs expressed in formal languages are syntactic entities whose properties may be studied without regard to any meaning they may be given, and, in fact, need not be given any.

Syntax is usually associated with the rules (or grammar) governing the composition of texts in a formal language that constitute the well-formed formulas of a formal system.

In computer science, the term &quot;syntax&quot; refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed expressions in a programming language. As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.

== Syntactic entities ==
=== Symbols ===
A symbol is an idea, abstraction or concept, tokens of which may be marks or a metalanguage of marks which form a particular pattern. Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are logical constants which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if the formulation is consistent with the formation rules of the language. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.

=== Formal language ===
A &quot;formal language&quot; is a syntactic entity which consists of a set of finite strings of symbols which are its words (usually called its well-formed formulas). Which strings of symbols are words is determined by the creator of the language, usually by specifying a set of formation rules. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning.

=== Formation rules ===
&quot;Formation rules&quot; are a precise description of which strings of symbols are the well-formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).

=== Propositions ===
A proposition is a sentence expressing something true or false. A proposition is identified ontologically as an idea, concept or abstraction whose token instances are patterns of symbols, marks, sounds, or strings of words. Propositions are considered to be syntactic entities and also truthbearers.

=== Formal theories ===
A formal theory is a set of sentences in a formal language.

=== Formal systems ===
A &quot;formal system&quot; (also called a &quot;logical calculus&quot;, or a &quot;logical system&quot;) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a &quot;deductive system&quot;). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called &quot;inference rules&quot;) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Formal systems, like other syntactic entities may be defined without any interpretation given to it (as being, for instance, a system of arithmetic).

==== Syntactic consequence within a formal system ====

A formula A is a syntactic consequence within some formal system formula_1 of a set Г of formulas if there is a derivation in formal system formula_1 of A from the set Г.

:formula_3

Syntactic consequence does not depend on any interpretation of the formal system.

==== Syntactic completeness of a formal system ====
A formal system formula_4 is &quot;syntactically complete&quot; (also &quot;deductively complete&quot;, &quot;maximally complete&quot;, &quot;negation complete&quot; or simply &quot;complete&quot;) iff for each formula A of the language of the system either A or ¬A is a theorem of formula_4. In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete iff no unprovable axiom can be added to it as an axiom without introducing an inconsistency. Truth-functional propositional logic and first-order predicate logic are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single variable &quot;a&quot; is not a theorem, and neither is its negation, but these are not tautologies). Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem shows that no recursive system that is sufficiently powerful, such as the Peano axioms, can be both consistent and complete.

=== Interpretations ===
An &quot;interpretation&quot; of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. &quot;Giving an interpretation&quot; is synonymous with &quot;constructing a model&quot;. An interpretation is expressed in a metalanguage, which may itself be a formal language, and as such itself is a syntactic entity.

==History==
The region, known as Kundal (now a tiny village 40 km away from Sangli city) in medieval India, was the capital of the Chalukya Empire in the 12th century AD. During the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Sangli, Miraj and surrounding areas were captured from the Mughal Empire. Until 1801, Sangli was included in Miraj Jahangir. Sangli separated from Miraj in 1801, following a family quarrel between Chintamanrao Patwardhan and his paternal uncle, Gangadharrao Patwardhan, who had succeeded his childless elder brother as the sixth chief of Miraj in 1782.

Sangli is notable for the Brindavana (tomb) of Satyavrata Tirtha, a saint of the Dvaita Order of Vedanta and Peetadipathi of Uttaradi Math who took Samadhi in Sangli in the year 1638.

Sangli is well known as Natya Pandhari (Capital of Marathi Dramas) while Miraj is well known for manufacturing &amp; exports of musical instruments. 

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s original name was Sahagalli—from the Marathi words &quot;Saha&quot; (&quot;six&quot;) and &quot;Galli&quot; (&quot;lanes&quot;) describing the early street plan—which was later shortened to Sangli.

<doc id="546042" wikidata="Q3293310" url="?curid=546042" title="Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II">
<text>At the end of World War II, Poland underwent major changes to the location of its international border. In 1945, after the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Oder–Neisse line became its western border, resulting in gaining the Recovered Territories from Germany. The Curzon Line became its eastern border, resulting in the loss of the Eastern Borderlands to the Soviet Union.

== Decision ==
These decisions were in accordance with the decisions made first by the Allies at the Tehran Conference of 1943 where the Soviet Union demanded the recognition of the line proposed by British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon in 1920.

The same Soviet stance was repeated by Joseph Stalin again at the Yalta Conference with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in February 1945, but much more forcefully in the face of the looming German defeat. The new borders were ratified at the Potsdam Conference of August 1945 exactly as proposed by Stalin who already controlled the whole of East-Central Europe. Harry Truman remembered:

Large territories of Polish Second Republic were ceded to the Soviet Union by the Moscow-backed Polish government, and today form part of Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. Poland was instead given the Free State of Danzig and the German areas east of the rivers Oder and Neisse (see Recovered Territories), pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the lands were effectively ceded by Germany.

== Population transfer ==
The population transfer of both Polish and Germans 1945–46 included many millions of people. The Polish territory in 1919–39 covered an area of . But from 1947, Poland&#x27;s territory was reduced to , so the country lost of land. This difference amounts almost to the size of the Czech Republic, although Poland ended up with a much longer coastline on the Baltic Sea compared to its 1939 borders.

==Outcome==
The prewar eastern Polish territories of Kresy, which the Red Army had overrun during the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 (excluding the Białystok region) were permanently ceded to the USSR by the new Polish communist government, and most of their Polish inhabitants expelled. As a result of the Potsdam Agreement to which Poland&#x27;s government-in-exile was not invited, Poland lost (45%) of prewar territories in the east, including over 12 million citizens of whom 4.3 million were Polish-speakers. Today, these territories are part of sovereign Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania.

In turn, postwar Poland was assigned considerably smaller territories to the west including the prewar Free City of Danzig and the former territory of Germany east of the Oder–Neisse line, consisting of the southern portion of East Prussia and most of Pomerania, Neumark (East Brandenburg), and German Silesia. Poland also received the town of Swinemünde (now Świnoujście) on the island of Usedom and the city of Stettin (now Szczecin) on the western bank of the Oder river in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Therefore, these transferred territories did not then form part of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany or the subsequent state of East Germany.

The German population who had stayed at or had returned to their homes were forcibly expelled before these Recovered Territories (official term) were repopulated by Poles expelled from the eastern regions and those from central Poland. The borders of Poland resembled the borders of the German-Russian gains in World War 2, with the exception of the city of Bialystok. This is called the Curzon line. The small area of Trans-Olza, which had been annexed by Poland in late 1938, was returned to Czechoslovakia on Stalin&#x27;s orders.

<text>Arthur Bliss Lane (16 June 1894 – 12 August 1956) was a United States diplomat who served in Latin America and Europe. During his diplomatic career he dealt with the rise of a dictatorship in Nicaragua in the 1930s, World War II and its aftermath in Europe, and the rise of the Soviet-installed communist regime in Poland.

== Biography ==

Lane was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York on June 16, 1894, and attended Yale University. After graduating in 1916, he became private secretary to the U.S. Ambassador to Italy in Rome. In 1919-1920 he was 2nd secretary in the U.S. embassy to Poland. In 1921-1922, he was 2nd secretary in London. During this time he was secretary to the U.S. delegation to the 1921 Conference of Ambassadors in Paris. He then went to Berne, Switzerland in 1922. From 1923 to 1925 he worked at the U.S. State Department in Washington, D.C. Lane then worked in the embassy in Mexico from 1925 to 1933.

He was appointed U.S. Minister to Nicaragua (1933–1936). While serving there he met with General Somoza while the President of Nicaragua Sacasa held talks with rebel leader Augusto César Sandino. Sandino called for the National Guard run by Somoza to be disbanded, as it had been founded by the U.S. as they withdrew their Marines from the country. Sandino was murdered by Guardsmen after the talks. The U.S. claimed that Lane had counseled Somoza to be patient, but Somoza (and later the Sandinistas) claimed that Lane gave Somoza permission for the assassination. Lane spent the next two years trying to reconcile Somoza and Sacasa, leaving the country before the next election as the U.S. adopted a more non-interventionist policy.
He was next U.S. minister to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from 1936 to 1937; the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (from 1937 to 1941, until the German invasion); and Costa Rica in 1941–1942. He was then appointed Ambassador to Colombia (1942–1944), and subsequently to Poland from 1944 to 1947, first to the Polish government in exile in London and later in Warsaw to the post-war government.

While in Poland, Lane resigned his post on February 24, 1947, in protest of the takeover of the country by the Communist puppet regime, and wrote a book detailing what he considered to be the failure of the United States and Britain to keep their promise that the Poles would have a free election after the war. In that book he described what he considered the betrayal of Poland by the Western Allies, hence the title, &quot;I Saw Poland Betrayed&quot;. The book was translated into Polish and published in the United States, and later disseminated by an underground samizdat publishing house in Poland in the 1980s.

According to Lane, the U.S. and Britain at the Tehran Conference agreed to the dismemberment of eastern Poland. He considered this act a treacherous breach of the United States Constitution, since Roosevelt never reported his decision to the Senate. The Yalta Conference was the final death blow to Poland&#x27;s hopes for independence and for a democratic form of government, according to Lane.

Following his career at the State Department, Lane was active in investigating the Katyn Massacre and also active in several anti-Communist organizations, such as the National Committee for a Free Europe. He would also later campaign for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election, in opposition to his former boss, Democrat Harry Truman.

After his death, Lane&#x27;s papers were archived in Yale University&#x27;s Sterling Memorial Library.

<text>I Saw Poland Betrayed: An American Ambassador Reports to the American People (1948) is a book written by former United States ambassador to Poland, Arthur Bliss Lane, who observed what he considered to be the betrayal of Poland by the Western Allies at the end of World War II. He resigned as ambassador in 1947 in order to inform Americans what was occurring &quot;behind the Iron Curtain.&quot;

==Publication history==
A Polish version of the book was published in the United States, and later republished by an underground publishing house &quot;Krąg&quot; in 1984 in Communist-dominated Poland.

The first English edition was published by the Bobbs-Merrill Company in 1948. The John Birch Society directed the publication of two further editions of the book, in 1961 as a part of &quot;One Dozen Candles, Vol. 2&quot; of the American Opinion reprint series and in 1965 as a part of Western Islands’ &quot;Americanist Library&quot; series.

The most recent English edition was published as a paperback by Literary Licensing, LLC in October 2011. A further Polish edition was published by Fronda in 2019.

<doc id="546053" wikidata="Q314025" url="?curid=546053" title="Antipope Anacletus II">
<text>Anacletus II (died January 25, 1138), born Pietro Pierleoni, was an antipope who ruled in opposition to Pope Innocent II from 1130 until his death in 1138. After the death of Pope Honorius II, the college of cardinals was divided over his successor. Unusually, the election was entrusted to eight cardinals, who elected Papareschi (Innocent II). A larger body of cardinals then elected Pierleoni, which led to a major schism in the Roman Catholic Church. Anacletus had the support of most Romans, including the Frangipani family, and Innocent was forced to flee to France. North of the Alps, Innocent gained the crucial support of the major religious orders, in particular Bernard of Clairvaux&#x27;s Cistercians, the Abbot of Cluny Peter the Venerable; and Norbert of Xanten, the Archbishop of Magdeburg who established the Premonstratensians and held a high rank in the court of the German Emperor Lothar III. 

The lack of support from these key figures left Anacletus with few patrons outside of Rome. Anacletus, with little remaining support, lived for several years and died with the crisis unresolved. In 1139 the second Lateran Council ended the schism, although opinion remained divided.

==Life==
Pietro was born to the powerful Roman family of the Pierleoni, the son of the consul Pier Leoni. One of his great-great grandparents, Benedictus, maybe Baruch in Hebrew, was a Jew who converted into Christianity. As a second son with ambitions, Pietro was destined for an ecclesiastical career. He studied in Paris and entered the Benedictine Abbey of Cluny. Later he went to Rome and occupied several important positions.

==Election==
In 1130, Pope Honorius II lay dying and the cardinals decided that they would entrust the election to a commission of eight men, led by papal chancellor Haimeric, who had his candidate Cardinal Gregory Papareschi hastily elected as Pope Innocent II. He was consecrated on February 14, the day after Honorius&#x27; death.

On the same day, the other cardinals, led by the senior Cardinal Bishop, Pietro of Porto, met with the leaders of Rome in the Basilica of S. Marco, and announced that Innocent had not been canonically elected. He nominated Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni, a Roman whose family were the enemy of Haimeric&#x27;s supporters the Frangipani, who was elected by the Cardinals, clergy, nobility and People of Rome. Anacletus&#x27; supporters included the entire Roman aristocracy, with the exception of the Frangipani, and the majority of the Cardinals. With the support of the People, and in opposition to the French Haimeric, the Pierleoni were powerful enough to take control of Rome, while Innocent was forced to flee north of the Alps.

==Conflict==
North of the Alps, Innocent gained the crucial support of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter the Venerable, and other prominent reformers who helped him gain recognition from European rulers such as Emperor Lothair III, leaving Anacletus with few patrons. Anacletus had been a relatively acceptable candidate for the Papacy, being well-respected, so rumors centering on his descent from a Jewish convert were spread to blacken his reputation. Bernard of Clairvaux wrote: &quot;It is a disgrace for Christ that a Jew sits on the throne of St. Peter&#x27;s.&quot; Among his supporters were duke William X of Aquitaine, who decided for him against the will of his own bishops, and the powerful Roger II of Sicily, whose title of &quot;King of Sicily&quot; Anacletus had approved by papal bull after his accession.

By 1135 Anacletus&#x27; position was weak despite their aid, but the schism only ended with his death in 1138, after which Gregorio Conti was elected as Victor IV but submitted to Innocent within a month. Innocent returned to Rome and ruled without opposition, quickly convening the Second Lateran Council in 1139 and reinforcing the Church&#x27;s teachings against Usury, clerical marriage, and other practices.

Though the Pierleoni family mostly submitted to Innocent and his successors, Anacletus&#x27; brother Giordano, who was then leader of the Commune of Rome, actively opposed these successors in the following decade.

<doc id="546059" wikidata="Q391393" url="?curid=546059" title="Agathocles (band)">
<text>Agathocles is a Belgian political grindcore band. Founded in 1985, it is mainly known for producing a large quantity of split seven-inch EPs. They play a style of grindcore they have dubbed &quot;mincecore&quot;. Their lyrical themes have focused on anti-fascism, animal liberation and anarchism. All of its members are vegetarians.

Their lineup has changed numerous times since they first started, the only consistent member being Jan Frederickx (also known as Jan AG).

==Biography==
===1980s===
Agathocles was formed in the Belgian city of Mol, aspiring to sound like bands such as Lärm and Hellhammer. Its original members, Jan and Erwin, were involved in the underground metal/punk scene since the start of the decade, releasing compilation tapes and zines. Only a few of their rehearsal tapes survive from 1984, their first year playing together, mainly as appearances on compilations.

Agathocles began playing concerts in 1985, although audiences were still small for the type of extreme music they produced. They had an on-air interview on the local radio station that year.

By 1987, the band&#x27;s line-up had begun to settle, albeit temporarily, in the form of Jan, Ronny and Erwin. They also found a long-term rehearsal space—Jam, a youth club in Mol—where they would not receive complaints or be ejected, as had happened in previous rehearsal rooms. They recorded more compilation tracks, organised more small concerts, and played gigs with other bands who would become equally famous, such as Napalm Death and Pestilence (and later Extreme Noise Terror, as well as smaller bands such as Violent Mosquitos and Total Mosh Project).

The first Agathocles releases were issued in 1988, which saw the arrival of a split EP with Riek Boois, as well as their first solo outing, &quot;Cabbalic Gnosticism&quot;, both of which were originally on cassette. Other material was recorded at the same time, but not released until later. By this time the band had four members, as Jakke had joined on guitar in December 1986, allowing Jan to concentrate on vocals.

Another guitarist, Guy, joined a year later, in 1989, and the split LP with the band Drudge was recorded and released on Deaf Records, as well as several other EPs. Towards the end of the year, the line-up changed yet again, with the bassist, Ronny, leaving the band and guitarist Jakke taking over from him.

===1990s===
A major line-up change occurred at the beginning of the decade, in May 1990, when Jan got rid of all the other members of the band and found two new members instead - Domingo on guitar and Burt on drums, with Jan now playing bass. Domingo and Burt were both from little-known Belgian grindcore band Necrosis, who recorded only one demo, in 1990. With the new line-up, the band ceased rehearsing in Mol, moving instead to the drummer&#x27;s home town of Zichem. Several more EPs were released in the same year and, with the band growing in popularity, they played gigs in Denmark as well as Belgium and went on a mini tour with the Japanese grindcore band SxOxB.

More line-up changes occurred throughout the next few years. Ex-Agathocles drummer Erwin briefly returned in 1991, now playing bass guitar. After only a few months with this line-up, Domingo left the band, leaving the band as a three-piece group during the recording of their &quot;Agarchy&quot; EP in July. However, the band soon had four members again when Domingo was replaced by Chris. It was with this line-up that they recorded &quot;Theatric Symbolisation Of Life&quot;, but towards the end of the year, Erwin left the band again and Agathocles got a new bassist called Dirk.

In the summer of 1991, Agathocles also went on another tour, this time in East Germany, with vocalist Tuur from fellow Belgian mincecore band Reign Of Terror. Tuur did vocals for this tour because guitarist Chris was unable to tour with the band, so Jan had to take over his guitarist duties.

The band&#x27;s line-up changed again in May 1992 when guitarist Chris and bassist Dirk left to form their own band. Agathocles found a new guitarist to take over from Chris - Steve (from Belgian grindcore band Intestinal Disease) - and Jan played bass guitar (as well as doing vocals). Two of the band&#x27;s LPs (&quot;Cliché?&quot; and &quot;Use Your Anger&quot;) were recorded with this new line-up and they also played one gig in Italy for the first time in a small town named Macomer (Sardinia).

The band remained a 3-piece group throughout 1993, with the line-up staying consistent as Jan, Burt and Steve. It was with this line-up that Agathocles went on a major European tour, visiting Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as recording several more split EPs. In 1994, the band retained the same line-up, this time touring in Spain (in July of that year), where they recorded the &quot;Mince Mongers In Barna&quot; EP in the rehearsal room of Spanish mincecore band Violent Headache. The &quot;Black Clouds Determinate&quot; CD was also recorded in this year.

The line-up stayed the same during the first half of 1995, during which time Agathocles recorded their album &quot;Razor Sharp Daggers&quot;, as well as featuring on the compilation &quot;Metalopolis&quot;, which was released by the Belgian radio station Studio Brussel. In the summer, however, the line-up changed again, with Matty replacing Steve on guitar.

This line-up would stay constant through 1996 and for most of 1997, two years in which Agathocles did a lot more touring. This started at the beginning of 1996, when the band visited Turkey, playing alongside the band &quot;Radical Noise&quot;, and then they toured the Czech Republic with the mincecore band Malignant Tumour. During this tour, the band recorded a video as a benefit for a Czech animal rights group. As well as recording the album &quot;Thanks For Your Hostility&quot; and several more split EPs, Agathocles also recorded a studio session in 1996 on the radio station Studio Brussel. Another such session was done the year later, this time in the BBC studios in England, where they recorded a Peel Session, in the same way that many other famous grindcore bands have done. 1997 was also the year that the &quot;Humarrogance&quot; album was recorded (as well as even more split EPs) and the band also toured in Germany with Swedish band Driller Killer. In November, the line-up changed again, when the band returned to being a four-piece, with Vince joining as the bass guitarist.

With this new line-up, the band toured again in Germany with Driller Killer in 1998 before Matty and Vince left the band in June and Dirk rejoined as the guitarist, with Jan playing bass again. This new line-up, of Jan, Burt and Dirk recorded several more split EPs, and toured in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. They also played gigs with other bands in the underground scene such as Unholy Grave, My Minds Mine and Malignant Tumour. The band ended the decade with a line-up that would last for several years into the new millennium.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Agathocles released their sixth full-length, &quot;To Serve… to Protect&quot;, that was distributed through the Italian label Vacation House (later re-released with bonus tracks by the Brazilian labels No Fashion HC and Heavy Metal Rock).

<text>The Beretta Model 1934 is an Italian compact, semi-automatic pistol which was issued as the service pistol of the Royal Italian Army beginning in 1934. As the standard sidearm of the Italian army it was issued to officers, NCOs and machine gun crews. It is chambered for the 9mm Corto, more commonly known as the .380 ACP.

==History and usage==
Armi Beretta SpA of Gardone Val Trompia has a history in firearms manufacturing reaching back to 1526, when they were established as a maker of barrels. But it was not until 1915 that, responding to the needs of the military during World War I, they produced their first pistol, the model 1915. Beretta has become one of the world&#x27;s largest pistol makers and the model 1934 (M1934) was their most numerous product in the World War II era.

It was designed and purpose-built for the Italian armed forces. In the early 1930s, the Italian army was impressed by the Walther PP pistol. Beretta did not want to lose a big military contract to their German competitor and designed the M1934 for the Italian Army which accepted it in 1937. This model was followed by the Beretta M1935, which was similar to the M1934 in most respects, except that it fired a .32 ACP (7.65 mm Browning) cartridge.

Pistols made during the Fascist Era are marked with their year of manufacture in two forms: the conventional Julian date in Arabic numerals and the date in the Fascist Era in Roman numerals. The Fascist calendar commenced on 28 October 1922, so a pistol from 1937 may carry either &quot;XV&quot; or &quot;XVI&quot; as its Fascist year. Pistols taken by the armed forces usually exhibit acceptance marks stamped into the frame on the left just above the grip: &quot;RE&quot; (Regio Esercito) for the army, &quot;RM&quot; (Regia Marina) for the navy, or &quot;RA&quot; (Regia Aeronautica) for the Air Force, always in the form of an Eagle wearing a Royal Crown for the Royal air force. Police pistols may be marked &quot;PS&quot; (Pubblica Sicurezza). The Romanian military, at the time an Axis power, also purchased model 1934 (and 1935) pistols. The calibre marking appears as 9 mm Scurt (short in Romanian) rather than 9 mm Corto. Romanian Army M1934&#x27;s differ from Italian M1934&#x27;s in that the Romanian pistols use the Russian sight picture, where the Italian pistols use the standard sight picture used by Western armies.

An M1934, serial number 606824, was used by Nathuram Godse in the 1948 assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The pistol, manufactured in 1934, was carried by an officer during Italy&#x27;s invasion of Abyssinia and subsequently taken by a British officer as a war trophy. It is not known how it came to India, but Godse was given the unlicensed firearm by a co-conspirator.

==Design ==
Fitted with the characteristic Beretta open slide, the M1934 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle; the elongated slot in the top of the slide acts as the ejection port. It is made with relatively few parts and very simple to maintain. The M1934 is very robust in construction with a long service life if properly maintained.

9mm Corto (.380 ACP) is less powerful than most other military service pistol cartridges, such as 9mm Parabellum or .45 ACP. The magazine capacity is only 7 rounds. When the empty magazine is removed it no longer holds the slide back. The slide will come forward and close the gun unless it is held open by application of the safety, a separate operation, and this slows down the reloading of the pistol.

<doc id="546073" wikidata="Q410137" url="?curid=546073" title="Factor VIII">
<text>Coagulation factor VIII (Factor VIII, FVIII, also known as anti-hemophilic factor (AHF)) is an essential blood clotting protein. In humans, it is encoded by &quot;F8&quot; gene. Defects in this gene result in hemophilia A, an X-linked bleeding disorder. 

Factor VIII is produced in the liver&#x27;s sinusoidal cells and endothelial cells outside the liver throughout the body. This protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form, bound to another molecule called von Willebrand factor, until an injury that damages blood vessels occurs. In response to injury, coagulation factor VIII is activated and separates from von Willebrand factor. The active protein (sometimes written as coagulation factor VIIIa) interacts with another coagulation factor called factor IX. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a blood clot.

Factor VIII participates in blood coagulation; it is a cofactor for factor IXa, which, in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipids, forms a complex that converts factor X to the activated form Xa. The factor VIII gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts. Transcript variant 1 encodes a large glycoprotein, isoform a, which circulates in plasma and associates with von Willebrand factor in a noncovalent complex. This protein undergoes multiple cleavage events. Transcript variant 2 encodes a putative small protein, isoform b, which consists primarily of the phospholipid binding domain of factor VIIIc. This binding domain is essential for coagulant activity.

People with high levels of factor VIII are at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Copper is a required cofactor for factor VIII and copper deficiency is known to increase the activity of factor VIII.
Factor VIII is available as a medication that is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.

==Genetics==

Factor VIII was first characterized in 1984 by scientists at Genentech. The gene for factor VIII is located on the X chromosome (Xq28). The gene for factor VIII presents an interesting primary structure, as another gene (&quot;F8A1&quot;) is embedded in one of its introns.

== Structure ==
Factor VIII protein consists of six domains: A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2, and is homologous to factor V.

The A domains are homologous to the A domains of the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin. The C domains belong to the phospholipid-binding discoidin domain family, and the C2 domain mediate membrane binding.

Activation of factor VIII to factor VIIIa is done by cleavage and release of the B domain. The protein is now divided to a heavy chain, consisting of the A1-A2 domains, and a light chain, consisting of the A3-C1-C2 domains. Both form non-covalently a complex in a calcium-dependent manner. This complex is the pro-coagulant factor VIIIa.

==Physiology==
FVIII is a glycoprotein procofactor. Although the primary site of release in humans is ambiguous, it is synthesized and released into the bloodstream by the vascular, glomerular, and tubular endothelium, and the sinusoidal cells of the liver. Hemophilia A has been corrected by liver transplantation. Transplanting hepatocytes was ineffective, but liver endothelial cells were effective.

In the blood, it mainly circulates in a stable noncovalent complex with von Willebrand factor. Upon activation by thrombin (factor IIa), it dissociates from the complex to interact with factor IXa in the coagulation cascade. It is a cofactor to factor IXa in the activation of factor X, which, in turn, with its cofactor factor Va, activates more thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin which polymerizes and crosslinks (using factor XIII) into a blood clot.

The factor VIII protein has a half-life of 12 hours in the blood stream when stabilized by the von Willebrand factor. 

No longer protected by vWF, activated FVIII is proteolytically inactivated in the process (most prominently by activated protein C and factor IXa) and quickly cleared from the blood stream.

Factor VIII is not affected by liver disease. In fact, levels usually are elevated in such instances.

==Medical use==
FVIII concentrated from donated blood plasma, or recombinant FVIII can be given to hemophiliacs to restore hemostasis. Bypassing agents such as recombinant FVIIa can be used in acquired hemophilia.

Antibody formation to factor VIII can also be a major concern for patients receiving therapy against bleeding; the incidence of these inhibitors is dependent of various factors, including the factor VIII product itself.

==Immunostain target==
Factor VIII related antigen is used as a target for immunohistochemistry, where endothelial cells, megakaryocytes, platelets and mast cells normally stain positive.

==Contamination scandal==
In the 1980s, some pharmaceutical companies such as Baxter International and Bayer sparked controversy by continuing to sell contaminated factor VIII after new heat-treated versions were available. Under FDA pressure, unheated product was pulled from US markets, but was sold to Asian, Latin American, and some European countries. The product was tainted with HIV, a concern that had been discussed by Bayer and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began to produce recombinant synthesized factor products, which now prevent nearly all forms of disease transmission during replacement therapy.

== History ==
Factor VIII was first discovered in 1937, but it was not until 1979 that its purification by Edward Tuddenham, Frances Rotblat and coworkers led to the molecular identification of the protein.

<doc id="546075" wikidata="Q2033871" url="?curid=546075" title="State space search">
<text>State space search is a process used in the field of computer science, including artificial intelligence (AI), in which successive configurations or &quot;states&quot; of an instance are considered, with the intention of finding a &quot;goal state&quot; with the desired property.

Problems are often modelled as a state space, a set of &quot;states&quot; that a problem can be in. The set of states forms a graph where two states are connected if there is an &quot;operation&quot; that can be performed to transform the first state into the second.

State space search often differs from traditional computer science search methods because the state space is &quot;implicit&quot;: the typical state space graph is much too large to generate and store in memory. Instead, nodes are generated as they are explored, and typically discarded thereafter. A solution to a combinatorial search instance may consist of the goal state itself, or of a path from some &quot;initial state&quot; to the goal state.

== Representation ==
In state space search, a state space is formally represented as a tuple formula_1, in which:
*formula_2 is the set of all possible states;
*formula_3 is the set of possible actions, not related to a particular state but regarding all the state space;
*formula_4 is the function that establishes which action is possible to perform in a certain state;
*formula_5 is the function that returns the state reached performing action formula_6 in state formula_7
*formula_8 is the cost of performing an action formula_6 in state formula_7. In many state spaces a is a constant, but this is not always true.

== Examples of state-space search algorithms==
=== Uninformed search ===
According to Poole and Mackworth, the following are &quot;uninformed&quot; state-space search methods, meaning that they do not have any prior information about the goal&#x27;s location.
* Traditional depth-first search
* Breadth-first search
* Iterative deepening
* Lowest-cost-first search / Uniform-cost search (UCS)

===Informed search ===
These methods take the goal&#x27;s location in the form of a heuristic function. Poole and Mackworth cite the following examples as informed search algorithms:
* Informed/Heuristic depth-first search
*Greedy best-first search
* A* search

* State space planning
* Branch and bound - a method for making state-space search more efficient by pruning subsets of it.

<text>Amenhotep II (sometimes called Amenophis II and meaning &quot;Amun is Satisfied&quot;) was the seventh pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. He inherited a vast kingdom from his father Thutmose III, and held it by means of a few military campaigns in Syria; however, he fought much less than his father, and his reign saw the effective cessation of hostilities between Egypt and Mitanni, the major kingdoms vying for power in Syria. His reign is usually dated from 1427 to 1401 BC. His consort was Tiaa, who was barred from any prestige until Amenhotep&#x27;s son, Thutmose IV, came into power.

==Family and early life==


Amenhotep II was born to Thutmose III and a minor wife of the king: Merytre-Hatshepsut. He was not, however, the firstborn son of this pharaoh; his elder brother Amenemhat, the son of the great king&#x27;s chief wife Satiah, was originally the intended heir to the throne since Amenemhat was designated the &#x27;king&#x27;s eldest son&quot; and overseer of the cattle of Amun in Year 24 of Thutmose&#x27;s reign. However, between Years 24 and 35 of Thutmose III, both queen Satiah and prince Amenemhat died, which prompted the pharaoh to marry the non-royal Merytre-Hatshepsut. She would bear Thutmose III a number of children including the future Amenhotep II. Amenhotep II was born and raised in Memphis in the north, instead of in Thebes, the traditional capital. While a prince, he oversaw deliveries of wood sent to the dockyard of Peru-nūfe in Memphis, and was made the &quot;Setem,&quot; the high priest over Lower Egypt. Amenhotep has left several inscriptions touting his athletic skills while he was a leader of the army before his crowning. Amenhotep was no less athletic than his powerful father. He claims to have been able to shoot an arrow through a copper target one palm thick, and that he was able to row his ship faster and farther than two hundred members of the navy could row theirs. Some scepticism concerning the truth of these claims has been expressed among Egyptologists.

Amenhotep acceded to the throne on the first day of the fourth month of Akhet, but his father died on the thirtieth day of the third month of Peret. If an Egyptian crown prince was proclaimed king but did not take the throne on the day after his father&#x27;s death, it meant that he served as the junior coregent during his father&#x27;s reign. A coregency with Thutmose III and Amenhotep II is believed to have lasted for two years and four months.
When he assumed power, Amenhotep II was 18 years old according to an inscription from his Great Sphinx stela:
: &quot;Now his Majesty appeared as king as a fine youth after he had become &#x27;well developed&#x27;, and had completed eighteen years in his strength and bravery.&quot;

After becoming pharaoh, Amenhotep married a woman of uncertain parentage named Tiaa. As many as ten sons and one daughter have been attributed to him. Amenhotep&#x27;s most important son was Thutmose IV, who succeeded him; however, there is significant evidence for his having many more children. Princes Amenhotep, Webensenu, Amenemopet, and Nedjem are all clearly attested, and Amenemhat, Khaemwaset, and Aakheperure as well as a daughter, Iaret, are also possible children.

Papyrus B.M. 10056, which dates to sometime after Amenhotep II&#x27;s tenth year, refers to a king&#x27;s son and setem-priest Amenhotep. This Amenhotep might also be attested in a stele from Amenhotep II&#x27;s temple at Giza, however the stele&#x27;s name has been defaced so that positive identification is impossible. Stele B may belong to another son, Webensenu. Webensenu&#x27;s name is otherwise attested on a statue of Amenhotep&#x27;s chief architect, Minmose, and his canopic jars and a funerary statue have been found in Amenhotep II&#x27;s tomb. Another Giza stele, stele C, records the name of a Prince Amenemopet, whose name is otherwise unattested. The same statue with the name Webensenu on it is also inscribed with the name of prince Nedjem, who is otherwise unattested.

There are other references to king&#x27;s sons from this period who may or may not be sons of Amenhotep II. Two graffiti from Sahel mention a king&#x27;s son and stable master named Khaemwaset, but specifically which king is his father is unknown. A figure with the name Amenemhet is recorded behind a prince Amenhotep in Theban tomb 64, and assuming this Amenhotep is indeed the king&#x27;s son from B.M. 10056, Amenemhat would also be Amenhotep II&#x27;s son. Additionally, a prince Aakheperure is mentioned in a Konosso graffito alongside a prince Amenhotep, and if one again assumes that this Amenhotep was the same person as the one in B.M. 10056, Aakheperure would also have been Amenhotep II&#x27;s son. However, in both these cases the figure identified as Amenhotep has been identified by some as possible references to the later King Amenhotep III, which would make these two princes sons of Thutmose IV. In addition to sons, Amenhotep II may have had a daughter named Iaret, but she could have also been the daughter of Thutmose IV.

Two more sons had been attributed to Amenhotep II in the past; however, they have since been proven to be of other parentage. Gauthier catalogued one Usersatet, the &quot;King&#x27;s son of Kush,&quot; (i.e. Viceroy of Nubia) as a son of Amenhotep II, as well as one Re; however, both are now known to be unrelated to the royal family.
Usersatet merely served as Amenhotep&#x27;s chief official in Nubia and was not a blood relative of the king.

==Dates and length of reign==

Amenhotep&#x27;s coronation can be dated without much difficulty because of a number of lunar dates in the reign of his father, Thutmose III. These sightings limit the date of Thutmose&#x27;s accession to either 1504 or 1479 BC. Thutmose died after 54 years of reign, at which time Amenhotep would have acceded to the throne. Amenhotep&#x27;s short 2 year coregency with his father would then move his accession two years and four months earlier, dating his accession to either 1427 BC in the low chronology, or in 1452 BC in the high chronology. The minimum length of his reign is indicated by a wine jar inscribed with the king&#x27;s prenomen found in Amenhotep II&#x27;s funerary temple at Thebes; it is dated to this king&#x27;s highest known date—his Year 26—and lists the name of the pharaoh&#x27;s vintner, Panehsy. Mortuary temples were generally not stocked until the king died or was near death; therefore, Amenhotep may not have lived much later beyond his 26th year. There are alternate theories which attempt to assign him a reign of up to 35 years, which is the absolute maximum length he could have reigned. In this chronology, he reigned from 1454 to 1419. There are certain problems facing these theories which cannot be resolved. In particular, this would mean Amenhotep died when he was 52, but an X-ray analysis of his mummy has shown him to have been about 40 when he died. Accordingly, Amenhotep II is usually given a reign of 26 years and said to have reigned from 1427 to 1401 BC.

However, it should be stressed that there are substantial gaps in clearly attested Year dates known for Amenhotep II&#x27;s reign. The monumental evidence only &quot;gives clear proof for Year 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 23 [of this ruler], hence it is not far-fetched to assume that the Year 26 [wine] amphora&quot; does refer to this king&#x27;s reign. This evidence alone shows that even a well known pharaoh who ruled Egypt for at least 25–26 years such as Amenhotep II had a long 14 year time gap in attested years between his 9th and 23rd regnal years. The only date that can indirectly be fitted into this large time gap to Amenhotep II is a Year 18 or possible Year 19 date based on Papyrus Leningrad (St. Petersburg) 1116A that lists grain allotments for a coming &quot;psdntyw&quot; feast and other occasion. While mentioning no king directly, the papyrus features early New Kingdom palaeography, mentions &quot;Peru-Nefer (the &quot;dockyard&quot; and royal residence once thought to be near Memphis), and bears the prenomen of Akheperure&quot; which was the royal name of Amenhotep II. These three facts combined, as Peter Der Manuelian writes, 
: &quot;all speak for a secure dating. The papyrus may be chronologically pinpointed further to Amenhotep&#x27;s eighteenth, nineteenth, or twentieth year. Line 19 of the text mentions an allotment on II smw 30 &quot;from the grain of year 18,&quot; possibly indicating that the papyrus dates to year 19&quot;

The Jewish historian Josephus, in his book Contra Apionem which translated Manetho&#x27;s Aegyptiaca, assigns Amenhotep II, a certain &quot;Amenophis&quot; a reign of 30 years and 10 months. Therefore, it is eminently possible that Amenhotep II could have reigned for 5 years more after his Year 26 date given that Amenhotep II ruled unattested for more than a decade between his 9th and 23rd regnal years. Significantly, as the British Egyptologist David Aston writes &quot;inscriptions at Karnak refer to both a &quot;Heb sed&quot; and a renewal of the &quot;Heb sed&quot; under Amenophis II, and since a king usually celebrated his first &quot;Heb sed&quot; festival in Year 30, and his second Year 34,&quot; these inscriptions may suggest a minimum reign of 30+ years for Amenhotep II.

Donald B. Redford, in contrast, in his 1986 book &quot;Pharaonic King Lists, Annals and Day Books&quot;, Mississauga, 1986, pp. 179–183, believes that &quot;Heb sed&quot; references recorded on the pillars of various Karnak monuments of Amenophis I, Tuthmosis III, Amenophis II and Tuthmosis IV are nothing but “pillar benedictions” being simply copies of those found on the pillars of the small bark temple of Sesostris I, and thus have no chronological worth. However, since Amenhotep II has a Year 26 inferred from a wine amphora, this pharaoh only had to rule for another 5 years or 8 years after his Year 26 to have a reign of 31 or 34 years which is quite possible since he ruled unattested in the historical records for 14 years between his 9th and 23rd regnal years. 

Finally, modern X-ray evidence which suggests that Amenhotep II was 40 at death may not account for a person&#x27;s precise age at death 3,000+ years ago. Amenhotep II&#x27;s Great Sphinx Stela reveals that he was 18 years old when he became king. If one accepts that Amenhotep II had a short 2 year co-regency with his father Thutmose III at the beginning of his reign as Peter Der Manuelian notes, he would already be 42 years old at death (or 18 years plus a sole 24 year reign). But if Amenhotep II enjoyed a reign of 31 years as Josephus&#x27; copy of Manetho&#x27;s Aegyptiaca assumes, then this king would have been about 47 years old at death (18 years plus a sole 29 year reign) and the X-ray evidence would be incorrect by 7 years.

==Foreign affairs==
Amenhotep&#x27;s first campaign took place in his third regnal year. It is known that the pharaoh was attacked by the host of Qatna while crossing the Orontes river, but he emerged victorious and acquired rich booty, among which even the equipment of a Mitanni charioteer is mentioned. The king was well known for his physical prowess and is said to have singlehandedly killed seven rebel princes at Kadesh, which successfully terminated his first Syrian campaign on a victorious note. After the campaign, the king ordered the bodies of the seven princes to be hung upside down on the prow of his ship. Upon reaching Thebes all but one of the princes were mounted on the city walls. The other was taken to the often rebellious territory of Nubia and hung on the city wall of Napata, as an example of the consequence of rising against Pharaoh and to demoralise any Nubian opponents of Egyptian authority there. Amenhotep called this campaign his first in a Stele from Amada, however he also called his second campaign his first, causing some confusion. The most common solution for this, although not universally accepted, is that this was the first campaign he fought alone before the death of his father and thus before he was the sole king of Egypt, and he counted his second campaign as his first because it was the first that was his and his alone.

In April of his seventh year, Amenhotep was faced with a major rebellion in Syria by the vassal states of Naharin and dispatched his army to the Levant to suppress it. This rebellion was likely instigated by Egypt&#x27;s chief Near Eastern rival, Mitanni. His stele of victory carved after this campaign records no major battles, which has been read a number of ways. It may be that this campaign was more similar to one of the tours of Syria which his father had fought, and he only engaged minor garrisons in battle and forced cities to swear allegiance to him–oaths immediately broken after his departure. Alternatively, it appears that the two weeks when Amenhotep would have been closest to Mitanni are omitted from the stele, thus it is possible that his army was defeated on this campaign.

Amenhotep&#x27;s last campaign took place in his ninth year, however it apparently did not proceed farther north than the Sea of Galilee. According to the list of plunder from this campaign, Amenhotep claims to have taken 101,128 slaves. These numbers however are difficult to substantiate, leading some to question the accuracy of Amenhotep&#x27;s court scribes. Others have suggested that such exaggerated figures may instead be simply due to compounded accounting mistakes. Examples include a possible recount of the 15,070 prisoners taken in his year 7 campaign in Nukhash being combined with the figures from his year 9 campaign. 
After the campaign in Amenhotep&#x27;s ninth year, Mitanni sought to make peace with Egypt, and from then on, their armies never fought again. Amenhotep records that the kings of Babylon, the Hittites, and Mitanni came to make peace and pay tribute to him after his ninth year, although this may be outlandish boasting. However, a second passage appears on the walls of Karnak, saying that the princes of Mitanni came to seek peace with Amenhotep, and this cannot be so easily explained away. The rising power of the Hittites eventually persuaded Mitanni to seek an ally, and there was definitely a treaty of some sort between Egypt and Mitanni by the time of Amenhotep&#x27;s successor, but it may be that it was enacted after Amenhotep&#x27;s campaigns, to try to prevent any more campaigns of mass deportations. Whenever formal peace was enacted, an informal peace was maintained between Amenhotep and the king of Mitanni. The new peace ties between the two benefitted both nations. For Mitanni, relaxing military conflict with Egypt to its south allowed it to focus more on the rising powers of the Hittites and the Assyrians to its north. For Egypt, it was able to begin extracting significant amounts of resources from Syria and Palestine and it was also now able to access Mediterranean trade routes with the Aegean. Thereafter, Amenhotep concentrated on domestic matters, with one possible exception. A shrine of Amenhotep&#x27;s Nubian viceroy shows Amenhotep receiving tribute after a Nubian campaign, but it is not possible to date when this happened.

==Construction projects==
Since Thutmose III had devoted so much energy to expanding Karnak, Amenhotep&#x27;s building projects were largely focused on enlarging smaller temples all over Egypt. In the Delta, his father&#x27;s &quot;Overseer of Works&quot;, Minmose, is attested from an inscription at Tura as overseeing construction of more temples. In upper Egypt, small shrines are attested at Medamud, el-Tod, and Armant. Karnak, despite not receiving the attention given it by his father, also was not totally neglected. He commissioned a column to stand in the courtyard between the fourth and fifth pylons commemorating the reception of tribute from Mitanni. In Nubia, Amenhotep built at Qasr Ibrim and Semna, and ordered the decoration of the Temple at Kalabsha. However, his most famous Nubian temple was at Amada. Thutmose III had begun constructing a temple which, technically, was dedicated to Horus there, although the presence of Re-Harakhti and Amun-Re is easily observed. Amenhotep completed it and put in it the record of his year 3 campaign on a stele, which was until 1942 the source of most information about Amenhotep&#x27;s wars.

He had a mortuary temple constructed at the edge of the cultivation in the Theban Necropolis, close to where the Ramesseum was later built, but it was destroyed in ancient times.

==Personality and later life==

A stela from this pharaoh&#x27;s final years highlights his openly contemptuous attitude towards non-Egyptians. The document, which dates to &quot;Year 23 IV Akhet [day] 1, the day of the festival&quot; of Amenhotep II&#x27;s accession to power, is a copy of a personal letter which the king composed himself to Usersatet, his viceroy of Kush (Nubia). In it, Amenhotep II reminded Usersatet of their military exploits together in Syria and proceeds to criticize the way this official conducted his office as Viceroy. Amenhotep writes:
Usersatet was so impressed (or fearful) of Amenhotep&#x27;s message that he ordered a copy of it to be engraved on a stela &quot;that was once [located] at the Second Cataract [in Nubia] and is now in Boston.&quot;

Amenhotep II did not openly record the names of his queens; some Egyptologists theorize that he felt that women had become too powerful under titles such as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun. They point to the fact that he participated in his father&#x27;s removal of Hatshepsut&#x27;s name from her monuments and the destruction of her image.

The destruction of Hatshepsut&#x27;s images began during the co-regency of Amenhotep when his father was very old, but stopped during his reign. However, the king may have harbored his father&#x27;s concern that another woman would sit on the throne. Despite his efforts however it is possible that a female co-regent of Akhenaten ruled as pharaoh before the end of his own 18th dynasty.

Amenhotep II adopted a large number of Canaanite gods into the Egyptian pantheon, including Resheph, Hauron, Baal, Astarte, Qetesh, and a few others.

==Death and burial==
Amenhotep II was interred in his KV35 tomb in the Valley of the Kings; his mummy was found there within his original sarcophagus when the tomb was discovered in March 1898 by Victor Loret. The tomb also housed a mummy cache containing several New Kingdom pharaohs including Thutmose IV, Seti II, Ramesses III, Ramesses IV, and Ramesses VI. They had been re-buried in Amenhotep II&#x27;s tomb by the 21st Dynasty High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem II, during Siamun&#x27;s reign, to protect them from tomb robbers.

===Mummy===
The mummy of the king was first examined, described, and photographed in January 1902 by Gaston Maspero in the company of Howard Carter, Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing, and Pierre Lacau. The Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith examined Amenhotep&#x27;s mummy in 1907. During this examination the linen still adhering to the face was removed for an unobstructed view. He found the body to be tall and noted a strong facial resemblance to his son, Thutmose IV. The wavy brown hair present on his head is &quot;abundantly interspersed with white.&quot; The arms are crossed low over the chest, with the right hand tightly clenched and the left less so. Unusually, the skin all over the body is covered with small tubercles though Smith could not say if they were the result of the embalming process or disease. Resin on the body preserved the impressions of jewellery; several rows of a beaded collar were present on the upper back, and a diamond-shaped geometric pattern seen on the back of the hips. Smith estimated he was forty to fifty at death based on his worn teeth and greying hair. His cause of death is unknown. His mummy has the inventory number CG 61069.

In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and four queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

<doc id="546082" wikidata="Q175011" url="?curid=546082" title="The Tomb of Dracula">
<text>The Tomb of Dracula is an American horror comic book series published by Marvel Comics from April 1972 to August 1979. The 70-issue series featured a group of vampire hunters who fought Count Dracula and other supernatural menaces. On rare occasions, Dracula would work with these vampire hunters against a common threat or battle other supernatural threats on his own, but more often than not, he was the antagonist rather than protagonist. In addition to his supernatural battles in this series, Marvel&#x27;s Dracula often served as a supervillain to other characters in the Marvel Universe, battling the likes of Blade the Vampire Slayer, Spider-Man, the Werewolf, the X-Men, Howard the Duck, and the licensed Robert E. Howard character Solomon Kane.

==Publication history==
===Original series===
In 1971, the Comics Code Authority relaxed some of its longstanding rules regarding horror comics, such as a virtual ban on vampires. Marvel had already tested the waters with a &quot;quasi-vampire&quot; character, Morbius, the Living Vampire, but the company was now prepared to launch a regular vampire title as part of its new line of horror books. After some discussion, it was decided to use the Dracula character, in large part because it was the most famous vampire to the general public, and also because Bram Stoker&#x27;s creation and secondary characters were by that time in the public domain.

The series suffered from lack of direction for its first year; most significantly, each of the first three issues was plotted by a different writer. Though Gerry Conway is credited as sole writer of issue #1, the plot was actually written by Roy Thomas and editor Stan Lee, and Conway had no input into the issue until it had already been fully drawn. Conway was allowed to plot issue #2 by himself, and wrote a story heavily influenced by the British Hammer Films - a striking departure from the first issue, which was derivative of Universal&#x27;s monster movies. Conway then quit the book due to an overabundance of writing assignments, and was replaced by Archie Goodwin with issue #3. Goodwin quit after only two issues, but also made major changes to the series&#x27;s direction, including the introduction of cast members Rachel Van Helsing and Taj Nital. New writer Gardner Fox took the series in yet another direction, and introduced a romance between Frank Drake and Rachel Van Helsing, which would remain a subplot for the rest of the series. However, Thomas (who had by this time succeeded Lee as the editor of &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;) felt that Fox&#x27;s take did not work, and took him off the book after only two issues.

The title gained stability and hit its stride when Marv Wolfman became scripter with the seventh issue, though Wolfman himself has contended that he was floundering on the series until the story arc in issues #12-14, remarking, &quot;This storyline is when I finally figured out what this book was about.&quot; The entire run of &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; was penciled by Gene Colan, with Tom Palmer inking all but #1, 2, and 8-11. Gil Kane drew many of the covers for the first few years, as he did for many other Marvel titles. Colan based the visual appearance of Marvel&#x27;s Dracula not on Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, or any other actor who had played the vampire on film, but rather on actor Jack Palance. Palance would play Dracula in a television production of Stoker&#x27;s novel the year after &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; debuted.

Colan, already one of Marvel&#x27;s most well-established and prominent artists, said he had lobbied for the assignment.
Wolfman and Colan developed a bond while working on the series, on which they collaborated closely. Colan recalled, &quot;He&#x27;d give me a written plot, but he&#x27;d also discuss it with me over the phone. I tended to ask questions, rather than to have him assume I got the idea.&quot;

Dracula encountered the Werewolf in a crossover story beginning in &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #18 (March 1974) and continuing the same month in &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; #15 with both chapters written by Wolfman. A brief meeting between Dracula and Spider-Man occurred in the first issue of &quot;Giant-Size Spider-Man&quot;. &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #44 featured a crossover story with &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #14, another series which was being drawn by Colan at the time. &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; ran for 70 issues until August 1979. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;With an unbroken run of seventy issues over the course of more than seven years, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; was the most successful comic book series to feature a villain as its title character.&quot; As cancellation loomed, Wolfman made to wrap up the storyline and lingering threads by issue #72. But Jim Shooter, then the editor-in-chief, retroactively cut two issues after the artwork had been completed for three. As Wolfman recalled,
Twelve of those pages, which Wolfman had saved as photocopies, appeared in the hardcover reprint collection &quot;The Tomb of Dracula Omnibus Vol. 2&quot;. The series culminated with the death of Quincy Harker and Dracula&#x27;s apparent death and dispersal.

In 2010, &quot;Comics Bulletin&quot; ranked Wolfman, Colan, and Palmer&#x27;s run on &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; fifth on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

===&quot;Dracula Lives!&quot;===

A black-and-white magazine, &quot;Dracula Lives!&quot;, published by &quot;Marvel Monster Group&quot;, ran from 1973 to 1975. &quot;Dracula Lives!&quot; ran 13 issues plus a reprint &quot;Super Annual&quot; issue. Running concurrently with &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot;, the continuities of the two titles occasionally overlapped, with storylines weaving between the two. Most of the time the stories in &quot;Dracula Lives!&quot; were stand-alone tales, including a serialized adaptation of the original Bram Stoker novel, in 10- to 12-page installments written by Roy Thomas and drawn by Dick Giordano.

===&quot;Giant-Size Dracula&quot;===
&quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; was supplemented by a &quot;Giant-Size&quot; companion quarterly comic book that ran for five issues in the mid-1970s. Artist John Byrne&#x27;s first story for Marvel Comics, &quot;Dark Asylum&quot;, was published in &quot;Giant-Size Dracula&quot; #5 (June 1975).

===Black-and-white magazine===
The color title &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; was succeeded by another black-and-white magazine, also called &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, with stories also drawn by Gene Colan that picked up where the color title left off. It lasted six issues from 1979 to 1980.

===Post-series Dracula appearances===
Several years later, Dracula encountered the X-Men twice. Although Dracula (and all other vampires in the Marvel Universe) were eventually destroyed by the mystical Montesi Formula in the pages of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #62 (December 1983), the vampire lord was revived. Marvel published a four-issue &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; miniseries, reuniting Wolfman and Colan, under its Epic Comics imprint in 1991, and revived Dracula and his foes in the short-lived &quot;Nightstalkers&quot; and &quot;Blade&quot; series in the 1990s. Some unresolved plot threads from &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; were addressed in the final three issues of &quot;Nightstalkers&quot;. These included the fates of Dracula&#x27;s bride Domini, their son Janus, and vampire-hunter Taj Nital. Dracula took the title role in the miniseries &quot;Dracula: Lord of the Undead&quot;.

Two more four-issue miniseries followed. &quot;Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; continued and concluded the adaptation of the original Bram Stoker novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by writer Roy Thomas and artist Dick Giordano, which had begun in &quot;Dracula Lives&quot; 30 years prior. Another &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; miniseries followed with Blade joining a new team of vampire hunters to prevent Dracula&#x27;s achieving godhood. &quot;Apocalypse vs. Dracula&quot; featured Dracula battling Apocalypse, an immortal foe of the superhero team the X-Men, in Victorian London.

===&quot;The Curse of Dracula&quot;===
Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan returned to Dracula comics with &quot;The Curse of Dracula&quot;, a three-issue miniseries published in 1998. The miniseries was published by Dark Horse Comics and was not officially associated with Marvel&#x27;s Dracula series. A trade paperback collection was published in 2005.

==Major characters==
* Dracula
* Quincy Harker, the son of Jonathan and Mina and disabled leader of the vampire hunters; he died in a battle with Dracula.
* Rachel van Helsing, the granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing and leader of the vampire hunters upon Harker&#x27;s death; she was turned into a vampire by Dracula and subsequently given a mercy killing by Wolverine of the X-Men.
* Blade the Vampire Slayer, the son of a woman bitten by a vampire during childbirth and a valued, yet reluctant ally to Quincy Harker&#x27;s band of vampire hunters. Blade possesses quasi-vampiric abilities, including a greatly prolonged lifespan and the ability to sense supernatural creatures, as well as an immunity to complete vampirism.
* Frank Drake, the last living mortal descendant of Dracula and a charter member of Quincy Harker&#x27;s vampire hunters. Note: Drake&#x27;s bloodline is based on one of Dracula&#x27;s marriages prior to his vampirism.
* Hannibal King, a vampire hunter and private investigator who is himself a reluctant vampire, frequent partner of Blade and Drake. He subsisted solely on blood he acquired from blood banks or corpses he found and had never taken blood directly from a human being, thus he was able to survive the Montesi Formula and be restored to normal human form.
* Taj Nital, a mute Indian Muslim vampire hunter of considerable strength (sufficient to temporarily restrain Dracula) whose son Adri was vampirized. He was later transformed into a vampire himself and destroyed in &quot;Nightstalkers&quot; #18.
* Safron Caulder, a showgirl from London and Blade&#x27;s recurring girlfriend. She sometimes found herself a typical damsel in distress, but was always rescued by Blade despite an instance when he was nearly tricked into staking her.
* Lilith, the daughter of Dracula, an immortal vampire who was cursed to never die until her father was permanently destroyed; when slain, she was reborn into the body of an innocent woman who wanted her father dead.
* Deacon Frost, the vampire responsible for the death of Blade&#x27;s mother and Hannibal King&#x27;s vampirism. He was an upstart contender for the title of Lord of the Vampires, a title held by Dracula at the time.
* Harold H. Harold, a hack writer who befriended the vampire hunters in an effort to get material for a book he was writing. He fell victim to Dracula and became a vampire (in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; magazine #5)—though this did not stop him from becoming a successful Hollywood film producer. Like all vampires, he perished as a result of the casting of the Montesi Formula.
* Anton Lupeski, a Satanic priest through whom Dracula manipulated his Satanic cult while impersonating Satan.
* Domini, a member of Anton Lupeski&#x27;s cult whom Dracula chose as his bride.
* Janus, the son of Dracula and Domini, who was possessed by a being called the Golden Angel. He was returned to his child form and at age five was kidnapped by the vampire Varnae (in the back story of &quot;Nightstalkers&quot; #16–18).
* Varnae, the first vampire (and, at one point, an enemy of Conan the Barbarian). He was the Lord of the Vampires prior to Dracula. Although he died in the process of making Dracula his heir, he was later revived. He was inspired by the 19th century character Varney the Vampire.
* Nimrod the First, another Lord of the Vampires prior to Dracula, who killed him in Nimrod&#x27;s first appearance (&quot;Dracula Lives!&quot; #3). When Dracula&#x27;s origin was revised in &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot; #33, Nimrod was no longer the true Lord of the Vampires; instead, he was a mentally imbalanced servant of Varnae and had been empowered by his master as a test of Dracula&#x27;s worthiness to become Varnae&#x27;s heir.
* Mina Harker is the mother of Quincy, and the bride of Dracula. She died in a great battle, but she was turned into a vampire by her husband Dracula. She acts like a human rather than a vampire. She is the Queen of Romania.

Some of the nudity was removed from the fourth volume. Publisher Dan Buckley explained, &quot;That wasn&#x27;t because we were going to bookstores, or because we were exclusively going to hobby shops. It probably had more with where we were at from a ratings standpoint and the editors felt that was the appropriate thing to do, considering how we communicate what&#x27;s going on in our books from a packaging standpoint. ...We generally avoid nudity, unless it&#x27;s a MAX title. We don&#x27;t want to take an Essential volume and start calling it MAX; then you get into branding issues.&quot; Retailers&#x27; opinions on the matter were split.

==Other media==
===TV movie===


In 1980, an anime television movie based on &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; was released. It was titled . Much of the main plot was condensed and many characters and subplots were truncated or omitted. The film was animated in Japan by Toei and sparsely released on cable TV in North America in 1983 by Harmony Gold dubbed into English under the title &quot;Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned&quot;. On October 31, 2022, Kineko Video released a remastered 4K scan of the film&#x27;s original 16mm print.

====Voice cast====
===Film===
Blade, a character introduced in &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, has been featured in a series of three films: &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002), and &quot;&quot; (2004), as well as a short-lived television series titled &quot;&quot; (2006). Other &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; characters, Deacon Frost and Hannibal King, have been featured in these films (Frost in &quot;Blade&quot;, King in &quot;&quot;), albeit in heavily revised forms. Reference to the &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; series is made in &quot;&quot; when King shows an issue of the comic to Blade.

Dracula himself does not appear in the series until &quot;&quot;, in which he goes by the name of &quot;Drake&quot; and features an origin and powers that differ from the comics. He is played in the film by Dominic Purcell. Given Drake&#x27;s age and origin, he, more than any other vampire that followed, can harness a much greater and more dynamic range of abilities. He possesses superhuman strength, much greater than that of Blade, as well as incredible speed. Like those he sired, he is capable of leaping great distances and seems to be knowledgeable of sword fighting techniques, even rivaling Blade himself. Drake&#x27;s true power is derived from his origin as the first of his species. The manipulation of energies which led to his first resurrection left Drake with two forms: human and a demonic alter ego. In this form, Drake is much stronger, resilient to all forms of damage and much taller than his human form. He possesses very keen senses, allowing him, for example, to catch an arrow in mid-air.

<text>Processing is a free graphics library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context.

Processing uses the Java programming language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.

The Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including Arduino and Wiring.

==History==
The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with Daniel Shiffman, who joined as a third project lead. Johanna Hedva joined the Foundation in 2014 as Director of Advocacy.

Originally, Processing had used the domain proce55ing.net, because the &quot;processing&quot; domain was taken; Reas and Fry eventually acquired the domain processing.org and moved the project to it in 2004. While the original name had a combination of letters and numbers, it was always officially referred to as &quot;processing&quot;, but the abbreviated term &quot;p5&quot; is still occasionally used (e.g. in &quot;p5.js&quot;) in reference to the old domain name.

In 2012 the Processing Foundation was established and received 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, supporting the community around the tools and ideas that started with the Processing Project. The foundation encourages people around the world to meet annually in local events called Processing Community Day.

==Features==
Processing includes a &quot;sketchbook&quot;, a minimal alternative to an integrated development environment (IDE) for organizing projects.

Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the codice_1 Java class (formerly a subclass of Java&#x27;s built-in Applet) which implements most of the Processing language&#x27;s features.

When programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as inner classes when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling. This means that the use of static variables and methods in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode.

Processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex data types that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: int (integer), char (character), float (real number), and color (RGB, RGBA, hex).

==Examples==
The simplest possible version of a &quot;Hello World&quot; program in Processing is:
// This prints &quot;Hello World.&quot; to the IDE console.
println(&quot;Hello World.&quot;);
However, due to the more visually-oriented nature of Processing, the following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language.
// Hello mouse.
void setup() {
 size(400, 400);
 stroke(255);
 background(192, 64, 0);

void draw() {
 line(150, 25, mouseX, mouseY);


==Awards==
In 2005 Reas and Fry won the Golden Nica award from Ars Electronica in its Net Vision category for their work on Processing.

Ben Fry won the 2011 National Design Award given by the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in the category of Interaction Design. The award statement says:

&quot;Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science, Ben Fry pursues a long-held fascination with visualizing data. As Principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston, Fry develops software, printed works, installations, and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents. With Casey Reas, he founded the Processing Project, an open-source programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactive-media software. It provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts.&quot;

==Related projects==

===Design By Numbers===
Processing was based on the original work done on Design By Numbers project at MIT. It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment.

===p5.js===
In 2013, Lauren McCarthy created p5.js, a native JavaScript alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. p5.js gained over 1.5 million users.

Since April 2022, p5.js has been led by Qianqian Ye, an Adjunct Associate Professor of Media Arts at USC.

===ml5.js===
ml5.js is a p5.js library developed by NYU&#x27;s ITP/IMA with funding and support provided by a Google Education grant.

Daniel Shiffman has made videos demonstrating ml5 and is a notable code contributor.

===Processing.js===
Processing.js is a discontinued JavaScript port that enabled existing Processing Java code to run on web.

It was initially released in 2008 by John Resig. The project was later run through a partnership between the Mozilla Foundation and Seneca College, led by David Humphrey, Al MacDonald, and Corban Brook. Processing.js was kept at parity with Processing up to its API version 2.1 release.

The project was discontinued in December 2018, two years after its active development had stopped.

===P5Py===
p5 is a Python library that provides high level drawing functionality to quickly create simulations and interactive art using Python. It combines the core ideas of Processing — learning to code in a visual context — with Python&#x27;s readability to make programming more accessible to beginners, educators, and artists.

===Processing.py===
Python Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit. It was chiefly developed by Jonathan Feinberg starting in 2010, with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov.

===py5===
py5 is a version of Processing for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java Processing jars available to the CPython interpreter using JPype. It can do just about everything Processing can do, except with Python instead of Java code.

===Wiring, Arduino, and Fritzing===
Processing has spawned another project, Wiring, which uses the Processing IDE with a collection of libraries written in the C++ language as a way to teach artists how to program microcontrollers. There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and Arduino, using the Wiring environment and language.
Fritzing is another software environment of the same sort, which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product.

===Mobile Processing===
Another spin-off project, now defunct, is Mobile Processing by Francis Li, which allowed software written using the Processing language and environment to run on Java powered mobile devices. Today some of the same functionality is provided by Processing itself.

===iProcessing===
iProcessing was built to help people develop native iPhone applications using the Processing language. It is an integration of the Processing.js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone.

===Spde===
Spde (Scala Processing Development Environment) replaces Processing&#x27;s reduced Java syntax and custom preprocessor with the off-the-shelf Scala programming language which also runs on the Java platform and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods, while also allowing more concise code, and supporting functional programming.

===JRubyArt===
JRubyArt (formerly named &quot;ruby-processing&quot;) is a wrapper for Processing in the Ruby language, that runs on the Java platform using JRuby.

===Quil===
Quil is an interactive animation library for Clojure and ClojureScript based on Processing.

== Media ==
The music video for &quot;House of Cards&quot; by Radiohead was created using Processing combined with data from lidar technology, along with using acrylic glass and mirrors to create scenes in which the image appears distorted, partially disappears, or disintegrate as if being carried by wind. Processing has also been used to create illustrations for publications such as &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, to output sculptures for gallery exhibitions, to control huge video walls and to knit sweaters.

<text>Edward Marsden Waring, MBE (21 February 1910 – 28 October 1986) was a British rugby league football coach, commentator and television presenter.

==Early life==
Waring was born on 21 February 1910 in Dewsbury, West Riding of Yorkshire to Arthur Waring, an insurance agent, and Florence Harriet Waring (née Marsden). He grew up in Soothill Nether, and attended Eastborough Council School, and Wheelwright Grammar School.

==Early career==

Waring was never a noted rugby league player; he was more proficient at association football, and had trials with Nottingham Forest and Barnsley. He began work as a typewriter salesman in his home town of Dewsbury, but he gave up that career to join a local newspaper and report on rugby league matches.

Alongside his fledgling journalism career he ran the local Dewsbury Boys Rugby League Club, renaming them the Black Knights (this foreshadowed how Super League clubs were branded some 60 years later). During the Second World War Waring managed Dewsbury RLFC as he was exempted from armed service with an ear condition. Recruiting men from a nearby military camp, he led the club to its second Challenge Cup victory in 1943 – the club&#x27;s last ever success in the competition.

Waring travelled on with the Great Britain national rugby league team on the first post-war tour of Australia. Returning home via the United States, he met Bob Hope, who alerted him to the success of televised sport. This is believed to have convinced him that television would be crucial for rugby league&#x27;s long-term success. In the UK, he pushed this case harder with the BBC, having written to them as far back as 1931. After several rejections, he was given a chance as a broadcaster when the BBC began to cover the sport. He made his first televised appearance as part of the coverage for the 1949 Challenge Cup final.

==Broadcasting style==
Waring&#x27;s commentary polarised opinion over the next decades. For some viewers he would be &quot;Uncle Eddie,&quot; the warm and friendly voice of the north, but others believed that his voice simply reinforced stereotypes. During the 1960s, his eccentric mode of speech (Hull Kingston Rovers was pronounced &quot;Hulking Stan Rovers&quot;) and his northern accent began to be widely impersonated, largely by Mike Yarwood.

In the badly rain-affected 1968 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley, Waring described Wakefield Trinity player Don Fox with the line &quot;He&#x27;s a poor lad!&quot; after Fox missed a last minute kick from in front of the posts against Leeds. The miss handed the cup to his opponents. His commentary on the game was widely praised; &quot;The Guardian&quot; said in 2007 that the game was &quot;seared into the public consciousness&quot; in part because of it.

Many of his lines became catchphrases in the game, including, &quot;It&#x27;s an up and under&quot; (a rugby tactic consisting of kicking the ball in a high arc, while the rest of the team rushes toward the landing point, hoping to gain possession and field position) and &quot;He&#x27;s goin&#x27; for an early bath&quot; (when a player was sent off the field for a serious foul).

== Celebrity appearances ==
Waring branched out, appearing first as the referee on the television series &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot;, and as the UK&#x27;s representative on the international umpiring team for the European version of the show, &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot;. When Arthur Ellis became the GB referee, Waring became the co-host of &quot;It&#x27;s A Knockout&quot; alongside David Vine and later Stuart Hall, compering the &#x27;Marathon&#x27; round, and commentating with those colleagues for the international version (where he handled the &#x27;Fil Rouge&#x27;) and co-hosting the annual international GB heat. From the 1979 series of &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres&quot;, Stuart Hall was the lone commentator, but Waring still co-hosted the GB heat in each series until 1981. Unwell, he struggled badly in the 1981 edition and seemed lost for words throughout. He was replaced by Brian Cant for the 1982 GB heat, the last series in which GB participated.

Waring was commentator on a rare professional wrestling show on BBC2 in 1965.

He also made guest appearances in the TV comedy programmes &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; and &quot;The Goodies&quot;.

== Decline and retirement ==
The split in opinion regarding his contribution to the game, plus illness, led to a decline in Waring&#x27;s popularity. A petition was organised by some hardcore supporters asking the BBC to remove him from commentary as he was perceived to be portraying a poor image of the game and its northern roots. The BBC stuck with him as their main commentator, though in the late 1970s they also brought in former Great Britain halfback Alex Murphy to work alongside him.

Illness affected him over the next few years, and in January 1981, Waring announced that he would be retiring from commentary at the end of the 1980–81 season. His last game as commentator was the 1981 Premiership final on 16 May 1981. After his retirement, former dual rugby international Ray French became the BBC&#x27;s chief rugby league commentator.

== Death ==
Waring&#x27;s overall health declined very quickly after his retirement from the commentary box. He was diagnosed with dementia and was admitted into High Royds Hospital in Menston, West Yorkshire in late 1983. He died at the hospital on 28 October 1986. His funeral took place at St Giles Church in Bramhope.

<doc id="546085" wikidata="Q954753" url="?curid=546085" title="Ratchet (instrument)">
<text>A ratchet or rattle, more specifically, cog rattle is a musical instrument of the percussion family and a warning/signaling device. It operates on the principle of the ratchet device, using a gearwheel and a stiff board mounted on a handle, which rotates freely. Variants include the gragger () used in Judaism, the rapach, and the raganella.

==Method of playing==
The player holds the handle and swings the whole mechanism around. The momentum makes the board click against the gearwheel, producing a clicking and rattling noise. A popular design consists of a thick wooden cog wheel attached to a handle and two wooden flanges that alternately hit the teeth of the cog when the handle turns. Alternatively, smaller ratchets are sometimes held still or mounted and the handle turned rapidly by the player. The mounted ratchets allow for greater control of the duration and timing of the sound. This allows the ratchet to be used like a snare drum, placing sustained rolls in precise durations of time. Dynamics are controlled by the rate at which the ratchet is rotated.

==Uses==

===In Jewish tradition===

In Judaism, the gragger (also &quot;grogger&quot; or &quot;gregger&quot;; ) is used for the holiday of Purim. The gragger is used every time Haman&#x27;s name is mentioned during the reading of the Megillah. Because Haman persecuted the Jews, the noise is supposed to symbolically drown out his name (although every word of the Megillah, including Haman&#x27;s name, must be heard clearly; therefore, the words are often repeated after the sounding of the gragger). The gragger originated in Jewish tradition to help make noise during the reading.

===Music===
The rattle is used in such compositions as Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot; and Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;. Respighi asks for one in the first movement of his orchestral work &quot;Pini di Roma&quot; (&quot;Pines of Rome&quot;), as does Tchaikovsky in his ballet, The Nutcracker. It is also used in &quot;Gnomus&quot; in Ravel&#x27;s orchestration of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;.
In orchestral percussion writing, a ratchet is used as a substitute.

===Sport===
Up until the early 1970s, this type of rattle was commonly used by fans at soccer and rugby matches in the United Kingdom and was known as a &quot;football rattle&quot;.

===Warning/signaling device===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, a policeman&#x27;s rattle was used by British and Australian policemen to summon assistance. They were used to warn of poison gas attack in the trenches of the First World War and issued to British police and ARP wardens during the Second World War, to warn of the presence of poison gas.

==Variants==

===Raganella===
The raganella (Italian for &quot;tree frog&quot;) is a percussion instrument common in the folk music of Calabria in southern Italy. Technically, the &quot;raganella&quot; is a &quot;cog rattle&quot;, producing a sound that is enough of a &quot;croak&quot; to have derived the folk name of the instrument from the Italian name of the common tree-frog. The &quot;raganella&quot; is about the size of a breadbox and consists of a wooden frame into which are fastened four or five stiff but flexible wooden tines fastened to one side of the frame; the other ends of the tines are struck in rapid succession by a cog-wheel that is turned by a crank handle mounted on the side of the frame.

===Rapach===
The rapach () is a larger version of the &quot;derkach&quot;, a ratchet. Rapachs are used by churches in the Prešov region of Slovakia by ethnic Ukrainians instead of bells during Easter.

<doc id="546092" wikidata="Q7703611" url="?curid=546092" title="Duchy of Aquitaine">
<text>The Duchy of Aquitaine (, ; , ) was a historical fiefdom located in the western, central and southern areas of present-day France, south of the river Loire. Although the full extent of the duchy, as well as its name, fluctuated greatly over the centuries and at times comprised much of what is now southwestern (Gascony) and central France.

The territory originated in 507 as a constituent kingdom of the Frankish kingdom after the Salian Franks conquered Aquitaine following the Battle of Vouillé, ultimately a recreation of the Roman provinces of . As a duchy, it broke up after the conquest of the independent Aquitanian duchy of Waiofar, going on to become a sub-kingdom within the Carolingian Empire. It was then absorbed by West Francia after the partition of Verdun in 843 and soon reappeared as a duchy under it. In 1153, an enlarged Aquitaine pledged loyalty to the Angevin kings of England. As a result, a rivalry emerged between the French monarchs and the Angevins over control of the latter&#x27;s territorial possessions in France. By the mid-13th century, only an enlarged Guyenne and Gascony remained in Angevin hands. The Hundred Years&#x27; War finally saw the kingdom of France gain full control over Aquitaine in the 1450s, with much of its territory directly incorporated into the French royal domain itself.
==History==

===Early history===

Gallia Aquitania fell under Visigothic rule in the 5th century. It was conquered by the Franks under Clovis I in 507, as a result of the Battle of Vouillé. During the 6th and early 7th century, it was under direct rule of Frankish kings, divided between the realms of Childebert II and Guntram in the Treaty of Andelot of 587. Under Chlothar II, Aquitaine was again an integral part of Francia, but after Chlothar&#x27;s death in 629, his heir Dagobert I granted a subkingdom in southern Aquitaine to his younger brother Charibert II. This subkingdom, consisting of Gascony and the southern fringe of Aquitaine proper, is conventionally known as &quot;Aquitaine&quot; and forms the historical basis for the later duchy. 
Charibert campaigned successfully against the Basques, but after his death in 632, they revolted again, in 635 subdued by an army sent by Dagobert (who was at the same time forced to deal with a rebellion in Brittany).

The duchy of Aquitaine established itself as a quasi-independent realm within the Frankish empire during the second half of the 7th century, certainly by 700 under Odo the Great. The first duke is on record under the name of Felix, and as having ruled from about 660. As his successor, Lupus held loose ties with the Frankish kings, ruling autonomously (&quot;princeps&quot;). Odo succeeded Lupus in 700 and signed a peace treaty with Charles Martel. He inflicted on the Moors a crushing defeat at the Battle of Toulouse in 721.

However, Charles Martel coveted the southern realm, crossed the Loire in 731 and looted much of Aquitaine. Odo engaged the Franks in battle, but lost and came out weakened. Soon after this battle, in 732, the Moors raided Vasconia and Aquitaine as far north as Poitiers and defeated Odo twice near Bordeaux. Odo saw no option but to invoke the aid of Charles Martel and pledge allegiance to the Frankish prince.

Odo was succeeded by his son Hunald, who reverted to former independence, so defying the Frankish Mayor of the Palace Charles Martel&#x27;s authority. In 735 and 736 Martel attacked Hunald and his allies, the counts of key Aquitanian towns such as Bourges and Limoges. Eventually Hunald retired to a monastery, leaving both the kingdom and the continuing conflict to Waifer, or Guaifer. Following the full occupation of Septimania in 759, Pepin turned now his attention to Aquitaine, initiating a cyclical military campaign that lasted for eight years, i.e. the War of Aquitaine. Waifer strenuously carried on an unequal struggle with the Carolingian Franks, but his assassination in 768 marked the demise of Aquitaine&#x27;s relative independence. During these years Aquitaine underwent intensive destruction of urban, economic, military and intellectual centres. Pepin&#x27;s forces destroyed up to 36 monasteries.

As a successor state to the Roman province of Gallia Aquitania and the Visigothic Kingdom (418–721), Aquitania (Aquitaine) and Languedoc (Toulouse) inherited the Visigothic Law and Roman Law which had combined to allow women more rights than their contemporaries in other parts of Europe. Particularly with the Liber Judiciorum, which was codified in 642 and 643 and expanded in the Code of Recceswinth in 653, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and women could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20. As a consequence, male-preference primogeniture was the practiced succession law for the nobility.

===Carolingian kingdom of Aquitaine===

The autonomous and troublesome duchy of Aquitaine was conquered by the Franks in 769, after a series of revolts against their suzerainty. In order to avoid a new demonstration of Aquitain particularism, Charlemagne decided to organize the land within his kingdom.

After the Carolingian conquest, the duchy ceased to exist as such, whose powers were taken over by the counts (dukes) of Toulouse, main seat of the Carolingian government in the Midi, represented by Chorso and, after being deposed, by Charlemagne&#x27;s trustee William (of Gellone), a close relative of his. In 781, he made his third son Louis, then three years of age, king of Aquitaine. The Carolingian kingdom of Aquitaine subordinated to the Carolingian king or (later) emperor based in Francia (Austrasia, Neustria). It included not only Aquitaine proper, but also Gothia, Vasconia (Gascony) and the Carolingian possessions in Spain as well. In 806, Charlemagne planned to divide his empire between his sons. Louis received Provence and Burgundy as additions to his kingdom.

When Louis succeeded Charlemagne as emperor in 814, he granted Aquitaine to his son Pepin I, after whose death in 838 the nobility of Aquitaine chose his son Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. 865) as their king. The emperor Louis I, however, opposed this arrangement and gave the kingdom to his youngest son Charles, afterwards the emperor Charles the Bald. Confusion and conflict resulted, eventually falling in favor of Charles; although from 845 to 852 Pepin II was in possession of the kingdom, at Eastertide 848 in Limoges, the magnates and prelates of Aquitaine formally elected Charles as their king. Later, at Orléans, he was anointed and crowned by Wenilo, archbishop of Sens. In 852, Pepin II was imprisoned by Charles the Bald, who soon afterwards pronounced his own son Charles as the ruler of Aquitaine. On the death of the younger Charles in 866, his brother Louis the Stammerer succeeded to the kingdom, and when, in 877, Louis became king of the Franks, Aquitaine was fully absorbed into the Frankish crown.

By a treaty made in 845 between Charles the Bald and Pepin II, the kingdom had been diminished by the loss of Poitou, Saintonge and Angoumois in the northwest of the region, which had been given to Rainulf I, count of Poitiers. The title of Duke of Aquitaine, already revived, was now borne by Rainulf, although it was also claimed by the counts of Toulouse. The new Duchy of Aquitaine, including the three districts already mentioned, remained in the hands of Ramulf&#x27;s successors, despite disagreement with their Frankish overlords, until 893 when Count Rainulf II was poisoned by order of King Charles III, or Charles the Simple. Charles then bestowed the duchy upon William the Pious, count of Auvergne, the founder of the abbey of Cluny, who was succeeded in 918 by his nephew, Count William II, who died in 926.

A succession of dukes followed, one of whom, William IV, fought against Hugh Capet, king of France, and another of whom, William V, called the Great, was able to strengthen and extend his authority considerably, although he yielded the proffered Lombard crown rather than fight Conrad II for it. William&#x27;s duchy almost reached the limits of the old Roman Gallia Aquitania but did not stretch south of the Garonne, a district which was in the possession of the Gascons. William died in 1030. Odo or Eudes (d. 1039) joined Gascony to Aquitaine.

===Angevin Empire===
The Ramnulfids had become the dominant power in southwestern France by the end of the 11th century. By marriage rather than conquest, their possessions passed into the &quot;Angevin Empire&quot; under the English crown by 1153.

William IX, Duke of Aquitaine (d. 1127), who succeeded to the dukedom in 1087, gained fame as a crusader and a troubadour. His granddaughter, Eleanor of Aquitaine, succeeded to the duchy at the age of 15 as the eldest daughter and heir of William X (d. 1137), as his son did not live past childhood. She married Louis, heir to the French throne, three months after her father&#x27;s death due to the quick thinking of Louis&#x27;s father, Louis VI of France, who did not want to leave a territory such as Aquitaine governed by a child of fifteen. When Louis VI died, and Eleanor&#x27;s new husband became King Louis VII, the duchy of Aquitaine officially came under the rule of the French Crown, and for fifteen years, Louis VII had territory that rivaled that of the English crown and the counts of Toulouse. The marriage was later annulled on the grounds of consanguinity by a bishop on 21 March 1152, and she kept her lands and title as Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right. On 18 May 1152, she married Henry, Duke of Normandy, the son of Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, and a claimant to the English throne. When he defeated his mother&#x27;s cousin, King Stephen, in 1153 and became King of England as Henry II, Aquitaine merged with the English crown.

Having suppressed a revolt in his new possession, Henry gave it to his son Richard. When Richard died in 1199, it reverted to Eleanor, and on her death in 1204, it was inherited by her son John and absorbed into the English crown permanently. The duchy henceforward followed the fortunes of the other English possessions in France, such as Normandy and Anjou, ultimately leading to the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France.

Aquitaine as it came to the English kings stretched from the Loire to the Pyrenees, but its range was limited to the southeast by the extensive lands of the counts of Toulouse. The name Guienne, a corruption of Aquitaine, seems to have come into use about the 10th century, and the subsequent history of Aquitaine is merged in that of Gascony and Guienne.

===Hundred Years&#x27; War===

In 1337, King Philip VI of France reclaimed the fief of Aquitaine (essentially corresponding to Gascony) from Eleanor&#x27;s descendant, Edward III of England. Edward in turn claimed the entire Kingdom of France as the only grandson of King Philip IV of France. This triggered the Hundred Years&#x27; War, in which both the Plantagenets and the House of Valois claimed supremacy over Aquitaine. In 1360, both sides signed the Treaty of Brétigny, in which Edward renounced his claim to the French crown but remained sovereign lord of Aquitaine (rather than merely duke). However, when the treaty was broken in 1369, both these English claims and the war resumed. In 1362, Edward III, as Lord of Aquitaine, made his eldest son Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Aquitaine. In 1390, King Richard II, son of Edward the Black Prince, appointed his uncle John of Gaunt as Duke of Aquitaine. That title passed on to John&#x27;s descendants although they belonged to the crown because John of Gaunt&#x27;s son, Henry IV, managed to successfully usurp the crown from Richard II, therefore &#x27;inheriting&#x27; the title Lord of Aquitaine from his father, which was passed down to his descendants as they became Kings. His son, Henry V of England, ruled over Aquitaine as King of England and Lord of Aquitaine from 1413 to 1422. He invaded France and emerged victorious at the Siege of Harfleur and the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He succeeded in obtaining the French crown for his family by the Treaty of Troyes in 1420. Henry V died in 1422, and his son Henry VI inherited the French throne at the age of less than a year; his reign saw the gradual loss of English control of France.

The Valois kings of France, claiming supremacy over Aquitaine, granted the title of duke to their heirs, the Dauphins, during 1345 and 1415: John II (1345–50), Charles VII (1392?–1401), and Louis (1401–1415). French victory was complete with the Battle of Castillon of 1453. England and France nominally remained at war for another 20 years, but England was in no position to continue its campaign, due to its escalating internal conflicts. The Hundred Years&#x27; War was formally concluded with the Treaty of Picquigny of 1475. With the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Aquitaine returned under direct rule of the king of France and remained in the possession of the king. Only occasionally was the title of &quot;Duke of Aquitaine&quot; granted to another member of the dynasty, and then as a purely nominal distinction.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Over the course of its existence, the duchy incorporated the Duchy of Gascony and, until 1271, the County of Toulouse, which now falls in the region of Occitanie. Most of the rest of the post-1271 duchy now forms the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, though parts fall into the three neighbouring regions of Pays de la Loire, Centre-Val de Loire and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

The county of Aquitaine as it stood in the High Middle Ages, then, was bordering the Pyrenees to the south (Navarre, Aragon and Barcelona, formerly the Marcha Hispanica) and the county of Toulouse and the kingdom of Burgundy (Arelat to the east. To the north, it bordered on Bretagne, Anjou, Blois and Bourbonnais, all of which had passed to the kingdom of France by the 13th century.

<text>Dried fruit is fruit from which the majority of the original water content has been removed prior to cooking or being eaten on its own. Drying may occur either naturally, by sun, through the use of industrial dehydrators, or by freeze drying. Dried fruit has a long tradition of use dating to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, and is valued for its sweet taste, nutritional content, and long shelf life.

In the 21st century, dried fruit consumption is widespread worldwide. Nearly half of dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears. These are referred to as &quot;conventional&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; dried fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in commercial dryers. Many fruits, such as cranberries, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g., sucrose syrup) prior to drying. Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.

==History==

Traditional dried fruits such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots, and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up of parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration was the earliest form of food preservation: figs, dates or grapes which fell from the plant and were sun-dried may have been consumed by early hunter-gatherers as edible and more long-lasting and sweeter.

The earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform; these were about diets based on grains, vegetables, and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners, and included dried fruits in their breads.

The date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago and grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent. Dates were the cheapest of staple foods due to high productivity, as an average date palm produced of fruit a year for more than 60 years.

Figs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt. In addition to appearing in wall paintings, many fig specimens were found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings.

Grape cultivation began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th millennium BC. Raisins were produced by sun-drying grapes. Raisin production and viticulture spread across northern Africa, including Morocco and Tunisia.

Dried fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of diets. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in large quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits.

Having dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: &quot;She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears, grapes, and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.&quot;

Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of common people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise, fennel seeds or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars.

Plums, apricots and peaches have their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3 BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were commonly eaten.

== Production ==


Dried fruit is produced in most regions of the world, and consumption occurs in all cultures and demographic segments. , raisins accounted for about two thirds of this volume. California produces the largest percentage of the US&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s dried fruit crop. It accounts for over 99% of the US crop of raisins and dried plums, 98% of dried figs, 96% of dried peaches, 92% of apricots and over 90% of dates. Most of California dried fruit production is centered in the San Joaquin Valley where the soil and climate, especially the hot, dry summers, provide ideal growing conditions. While these fruits were commonly dried in the sun in the past, now only raisins are almost entirely naturally sun-dried.

==Preparation and use==
Fruits can be dried whole (e.g., grapes, berries, apricot, plum), in halves, or as slices (e.g., mango, papaya, kiwi). Alternatively, they can be chopped after drying (e.g., dates), made into pastes, or concentrated juices. The residual moisture content can vary from small (3–8%) to substantial (16–18%), depending on the type of fruit. Fruits can also be spread out, dried and cut into stripes in its puree form without the addition of sugar or fats with at least 50% moisture content as fruit leather, (see patent listed under the references section) or as a powder by spray or drum drying. They can be freeze dried. Fresh fruit is frozen and placed in a drying chamber under a vacuum. Heat is applied, and water evaporates from the fruit while it is still frozen. The fruit becomes very light and crispy and retains much of its original flavor. Dried fruit is widely used by the confectionery, baking, and sweets industries. Food manufacturing plants use dried fruits in various sauces, soups, marinades, garnishes, puddings, and food for infants and children.

As ingredients in prepared food, dried fruit juices, purées, and pastes impart sensory and functional characteristics to recipes:

* The high fiber content provides water-absorbing and water-binding capabilities.
* Organic acids such as sorbitol act as humectants, provide dough and batter stability, and control water activity.
* Fruit sugars add sweetness, humectancy, and surface browning, and control water activity.
* Fruit acids, such as malic acid and tartaric acid, contribute to flavor enhancement.

The high drying and processing temperatures, the intrinsic low pH of the fruit, and the low water activity (moisture content) in dried fruit make them a stable food.

Sulfur dioxide is used as an antioxidant in some dried fruits to protect their color and flavor. For example, in golden raisins, dried peaches, apples, and apricots, sulfur dioxide is used to keep them from losing their light color by blocking browning reactions that darken fruit and alter their flavor. Over the years, sulfur dioxide and sulfites have been used by many populations for a variety of purposes. Sulfur dioxide was first employed as a food additive in 1664, and was later approved for such use in the United States as far back as the 1800s.

Sulfur dioxide, while harmless to healthy individuals, can induce asthma when inhaled or ingested by sensitive people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that one out of every hundred people is sulfite-sensitive, and about 5% of asthmatics are also at risk of suffering an adverse reaction. Given that about 10% of the population suffers from asthma, this figure translates to 0.5% of the whole population with potential for sulfite-sensitivity. These individuals make up the subgroup of greatest concern and are largely aware of the need to avoid sulfite-containing foods. Consequently, the FDA requires food manufacturers and processors to disclose the presence of sulfiting agents in concentrations of at least 10 parts per million.

In Taipei, Taiwan, a 2010 city health survey found one-third of tested dried fruit products failed health standard tests, most having excessive amounts of sodium cyclamate, some at levels 20 times higher than the legal limit.

Turkey exported 1.5 billion dollars worth of dried fruit in 2021 and became the world&#x27;s largest exporter of dried fruit.

== Health ==
=== Glycemic index ===

Traditional dried fruit has a low to moderate glycemic index (GI), a measure of how a food affects blood sugar levels. GI measures an individual&#x27;s response to eating a carbohydrate-containing food (usually 50 grams of available carbohydrates) compared to the individual&#x27;s response to the same amount of carbohydrates from either white bread or glucose. Carbohydrate-containing foods are classified as high (above 70), moderate (56–69), or low (0–55) GI. Foods with high fiber content generally have a low GI. However, other factors also contribute to a food&#x27;s glycemic response, such as the type of carbohydrate or sugar present, the physical characteristics of the food matrix, and the presence of organic acids. All studies assessing the GI of dried fruit show that they are low- to moderate-GI foods and that the insulin response is proportional to their GI. Factors thought to contribute to this glycemic response include the viscous texture of dried fruits when chewed, their whole food matrix, the presence of phenolic compounds and organic acids and the type of sugar present (about 50% fructose in most traditional dried fruit).

===Research===
Consumption of dried fruit is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases.

== Types ==
== Dehydration methods ==
People have practiced food preservation since ancient times. Many folktales describe ways of preserving foods in one way or another according to local and cultural traditions. Dehydration methods help to prevent food from spoilage and to maintain it for a longer period of time while keeping it suitable for consumption. Reducing the amount of water in fruits helps prevent bacteria, yeast or fungi from growing on them. There are several processes that can be used in the production of dried fruit, each of which affects its appearance, rehydration properties, and nutrients differently. These drying processes include sun drying, tray (air) drying, freeze drying, and vacuum microwave drying. Each process has its own benefits and disadvantages.
=== Sun drying ===

This process uses sun exposure as its thermal source, combined with natural airflow. It is also a traditional drying method to reduce the moisture of fruits by spreading them under the sun. Warmer temperatures evaporate the moisture, and lower humidity allows moisture to move quickly from the fruit to the air. However, there are many disadvantages associated with it, such as the longer time required to dry, the hot climate and daylight, and risk of invasion by animals and unwanted microorganisms.

=== Tray drying ===
A tray dryer is similar to a convection drier, which is placed in enclosed, insulated chambers and trays on top of each other in the tray. Input materials are batch-fed, placed in trays, and loaded into ovens for drying. Dryers are used in processing where drying and heating are important parts of the industrial manufacturing process, like dried fruits. Tray drying means dehydrating small pieces of fruit from a source of hot, dry air or the sun until they are dry enough to store at ambient temperature with minimal spoilage. Despite its poor re-hydration properties and shrunken appearance, this process requires a short period of time along with controlled humidity and heated air.
=== Freeze drying ===
Freeze-drying is a special form of drying that removes all moisture and has less effect on the taste of food than normal dehydration. Freeze drying is a water removal process commonly used to preserve pear material. The fruit is placed in a vacuum chamber at low heat to increase shelf life. This process works by freezing the material, then reducing the pressure and adding heat to neutralize the frozen water in the material. Unlike the other drying methods, this method allows the dried mango to retain its shape, retain the highest color value, and provide a great rehydration property despite its high costs. Foods that contain adequate amounts of water are very easy to work with and will maintain their initial shape after the freeze-drying process is complete.

=== Vacuum microwave drying ===
The microwave generates a specific amount of energy, easily shortening the drying time. In addition, the boiling point of water is lowered under vacuum, causing a high temperature inside the dried particles on the surface of the product. Microwave vacuum drying is a dehydration process that uses microwave radiation to generate heat at full pressure (chamber pressure). During vacuum drying, high-energy water molecules propagate to the surface and evaporate due to low pressure. Due to the absence of air, vacuum drying inhibits oxidation and maintains the color, texture, and taste of dried products. This device can improve the quality of products, and the equipment can prolong the shelf life of food, preserve the original taste and nutrients of food, maintain the physical activity of raw materials, enhance the function of healthy food, and increase the value of agricultural products. This method provides better flavor retention, greater rehydration, least nutrient loss, and least color change among other thermal drying methods, along with a faster drying rate compared to freeze drying. Vacuum microwave not only dries the mango quickly, it also reduces the amount of fibers and microorganisms present in the pulpy part of the fruit. The fruit taste is distorted at some rate. The vacuum drying also reduces the amount of water contained, and in a closed environment, no other microorganisms can enter into the fruit.

<text>In computer science, a state space is a discrete space representing the set of all possible configurations of a &quot;system&quot;. It is a useful abstraction for reasoning about the behavior of a given system and is widely used in the fields of artificial intelligence and game theory.

For instance, the toy problem Vacuum World has a discrete finite state space in which there are a limited set of configurations that the vacuum and dirt can be in. A &quot;counter&quot; system, where states are the natural numbers starting at 1 and are incremented over time has an infinite discrete state space. The angular position of an undamped pendulum is a continuous (and therefore infinite) state space.

==Definition==
State spaces are useful in computer science as a simple model of machines. Formally, a state space can be defined as a tuple [&quot;N&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;G&quot;] where:
* &quot;N&quot; is a set of states
* &quot;A&quot; is a set of arcs connecting the states
* &quot;S&quot; is a nonempty subset of &quot;N&quot; that contains start states
* &quot;G&quot; is a nonempty subset of &quot;N&quot; that contains the goal states.

==Properties==

A state space has some common properties:
* complexity, where branching factor is important
* structure of the space, see also graph theory:
** directionality of arcs
** tree
** rooted graph
For example, the Vacuum World has a branching factor of 4, as the vacuum cleaner can end up in 1 of 4 adjacent squares after moving (assuming it cannot stay in the same square nor move diagonally). The arcs of Vacuum World are bidirectional, since any square can be reached from any adjacent square, and the state space is not a tree since it is possible to enter a loop by moving between any 4 adjacent squares.

State spaces can be either infinite or finite, and discrete or continuous. 

===Size===
The size of the state space for a given system is the number of possible configurations of the space.
====Finite====
If the size of the state space is finite, calculating the size of the state space is a combinatorial problem. For example, in the Eight queens puzzle, the state space can be calculated by counting all possible ways to place 8 pieces on an 8x8 chessboard. This is the same as choosing 8 positions without replacement from a set of 64, or
:formula_1
This is significantly greater than the number of legal configurations of the queens, 92. In many games the effective state space is small compared to all reachable/legal states. This property is also observed in Chess, where the effective state space is the set of positions that can be reached by game-legal moves. This is far smaller than the set of positions that can be achieved by placing combinations of the available chess pieces directly on the board.

====Infinite====
All continuous state spaces can be described by a corresponding continuous function and are therefore infinite. Discrete state spaces can also have (countably) infinite size, such as the state space of the time-dependent &quot;counter&quot; system, similar to the system in queueing theory defining the number of customers in a line, which would have state space {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

==Exploration==

Exploring a state space is the process of enumerating possible states in search of a goal state. The state space of Pacman, for example, contains a goal state whenever all food pellets have been eaten, and is explored by moving Pacman around the board.

===Search States===
A search state is a compressed representation of a world state in a state space, and is used for exploration. Search states are used because a state space often encodes more information than is necessary to explore the space. Compressing each world state to only information needed for exploration improves efficiency by reducing the number of states in the search. For example, a state in the Pacman space includes information about the direction Pacman is facing (up, down, left, or right). Since it does not cost anything to change directions in Pacman, search states for Pacman would not include this information and reduce the size of the search space by a factor of 4, one for each direction Pacman could be facing.

===Methods===
Standard search algorithms are effective in exploring discrete state spaces. The following algorithms exhibit both completeness and optimality in searching a state space.
* Breadth-First Search
* A* Search
* Uniform Cost Search

These methods do not extend naturally to exploring continuous state spaces. Exploring a continuous state space in search of a given goal state is equivalent to optimizing an arbitrary continuous function which is not always possible, see mathematical optimization.

<doc id="546105" wikidata="Q48446" url="?curid=546105" title="S-300 missile system">
<text>The S-300 (NATO reporting name SA-10 Grumble) is a series of long-range surface-to-air missile systems developed by the former Soviet Union. It was produced by NPO Almaz for the Soviet Air Defence Forces to defend against air raids and cruise missiles. 

It is used by Russia, Ukraine, and other former Eastern Bloc countries, along with Bulgaria and Greece. It is also used by China, Iran, and other countries in Asia.

The system is fully automated, though manual observation and operation are also possible. Each targeting radar provides target designation for the central command post. The command post compares the data received from the targeting radars and filters out false targets. The central command post has both active and passive target detection modes. Missiles have a maximum range of from the command post.

The successor to the S-300 is the S-400 (NATO reporting name &quot;SA-21 Growler&quot;), which entered service on 28 April 2007.

==Variations and upgrades==
There are currently three main variations of the S-300, named S-300V, S-300P, S-300F. The production of the S-300 started in 1975, with the tests for the S-300P variant being completed in 1978. The tests for the S-300V variant were conducted in 1983, and its anti-ballistic capabilities were tested in 1987. Numerous versions have since emerged with different missiles, improved radars, better resistance to countermeasures, longer range, and better capability at targeting aircraft flying at very low altitude as well as incoming munitions, such as anti-radiation missiles or glide bombs.

===S-300 system family tree===






===S-300P (SA-10)===
The total production for the S-300P systems was 3,000 launchers and 28,000 missiles through 2012.

==== S-300P/S-300PT====
The S-300P/S-300PT (, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-10A Grumble A&quot;) is the original version of the S-300. The &quot;P&quot; suffix stands for PVO-Strany (, or country air defence). In 1987, over 80 of these systems were active, mainly around Moscow. An S-300PT unit consists of a 36D6 (NATO reporting name &quot;Tin Shield&quot;) surveillance radar, a 30N6 (&quot;FLAP LID&quot;) fire control system, and 5P85-1 launch vehicles. The 5P85-1 vehicles are semi-trailer trucks. A 76N6 (&quot;CLAM SHELL&quot;) low-altitude detection radar is usually also a part of the unit.

The S-300PT had a passive electronically scanned array radar and had the ability to engage multiple targets with a single fire-control system. Since the original system was semi-mobile, it took just over one hour to set up for firing. It ran the risk of the missile hot launch system scorching the transporter erector launcher (TEL).

It was originally intended to use a track-via-missile (TVM) guidance system. However, the TVM system had problems tracking targets below , allowing incoming SEAD aircraft to effectively utilize terrain masking to avoid tracking. To improve tracking of low-altitude targets, a command-guidance system was added to guide the missile for the initial part of the flight. This allowed the minimum engagement altitude to be set to .

Improvements to the S-300P resulted in several sub-versions for both domestic and international markets. The S-300PT-1 and S-300PT-1A are incremental upgrades of the original S-300PT system, using a new 5V55KD missile and a cold launch method. The time it took to set the system up was reduced to 30 minutes and trajectory optimizations allowed the 5V55KD to reach ranges up to .

==== S-300PS/S-300PM====

The S-300PS/S-300PM (Russian &quot;С-300ПC&quot;/&quot;С-300ПМ&quot;, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-10B Grumble B&quot;) was introduced in 1985 (according to Russia) and is the only version thought to have been fitted with a nuclear warhead. This model saw the introduction of the modern TEL and mobile radar and command-post vehicles that were all based on the MAZ-7910 8×8 truck. This model also featured new 5V55R missiles, which increased the maximum engagement range to and introduced a terminal semi-active radar homing (SARH) guidance mode. The surveillance radar of these systems was designated 30N6. Also introduced with this version was the distinction between self-propelled and towed TELs. The towed TEL is designated 5P85T. Mobile TELs were the 5P85S and 5P85D. The 5P85D was a &quot;slave&quot; TEL, being controlled by a 5P85S &quot;master&quot; TEL. The &quot;master&quot; TEL is identifiable thanks to the large equipment container behind the cabin; in the &quot;slave&quot; TEL this area is not enclosed and is used for cable or spare tyre storage.

==== S-300PMU====
Development of a modernized variant for export, called the S-300PMU (, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-10C Grumble C&quot;), was completed in 1985. The PMU variant was fielded with the 5V55K (range ) and 5V55R (range ) missiles. Radars used for the S-300PMU complex included the 30N6 (NATO: &quot;Flap Lid&quot;) target engagement radar, the 76N6 (NATO: &quot;Clam Shell&quot;) low altitude detection radar, and the ST-68U (NATO: &quot;Tin Shield&quot;) 3D search radar. In addition, the 64N6 (NATO: &quot;Big Bird&quot;) radar was used as a search radar at the regimental command post (an S-300PMU regiment typically consisted of three missile batteries). The S-300PMU could engage targets with a radar cross section of at least and a maximum velocity of at altitudes between and . It could also engage surface targets at ranges up to .

==== S-300PMU-1/2 (SA-20A/B)====

The S-300PMU-1 (, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-20A Gargoyle&quot;) was also introduced in 1993, with the new and larger 48N6 missiles for the first time in a land-based system, and keeping all the same performance improvements from the S-300PM version, including the increased speed, range, SAGG guidance, and ABM capability. The warhead is slightly smaller than the naval version at . This version also saw the introduction of the new and more capable 30N6E TOMB STONE radar.

The S-300PMU-1 was introduced in 1993, using different missile types in a single system for the first time. In addition to the 5V55R and 48N6E missiles, the S-300PMU-1 can utilise two new missiles, the 9M96E1 and 9M96E2. Both are significantly smaller than the previous missiles, at , respectively, and carry a smaller warhead. The 9M96E1 has an engagement range of , and the 9M96E2 of . They are still carried 4 per TEL. Rather than just relying on aerodynamic fins for manoeuvring, they use a gas-dynamic system which allows them to have an excellent probability of kill (Pk) despite the much smaller warhead. The Pk is estimated at 0.7 against a tactical ballistic missile, for either missile. The S-300PMU-1 typically uses the 83M6E command-and-control system, although it is also compatible with the older Baikal-1E and Senezh-M1E CCS command-and-control systems. The 83M6E system incorporates the 64N6E (&quot;BIG BIRD&quot;) surveillance/detection radar. The fire control/illumination and guidance radar used is the 30N6E(1), optionally matched with a 76N6 low-altitude detection radar and a 96L6E all-altitude detection radar. The 83M6E command-and-control system can control up to 12 TELs, both the self-propelled 5P85SE vehicle and the 5P85TE towed launchers. Generally, support vehicles are also included, such as the 40V6M tow vehicle, intended for lifting of the antenna post.

China developed its own version of the S-300PMU-1, called HQ-15. Previously, the missile was referred to in a Western think tank as the HQ-10, causing confusion with the unrelated HQ-10 short-range point-defense missile system.
The S-300PMU-2 &quot;Favorit&quot; (, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-20B Gargoyle&quot;), introduced in 1997 (presented ready 1996), is an upgrade to the S-300PMU-1 with a range of with the introduction of the 48N6E2 missile. This system is apparently capable against not just short-range ballistic missiles, but also medium-range ballistic missiles. It uses the 83M6E2 command and control system, consisting of the 54K6E2 command post vehicle and the 64N6E2 surveillance/detection radar. It employs the 30N6E2 fire control/illumination and guidance radar. Like the S-300PMU-1, 12 TELs can be controlled, with any mix of 5P85SE2 self-propelled and 5P85TE2 trailer launchers. Optionally it can make use of the 96L6E all-altitude detection radar and 76N6 low-altitude detection radar.

===S-300F===
==== Sea-based S-300F (SA-N-6)====
The S-300F &quot;Fort&quot; (, DoD designation &quot;SA-N-6&quot;, &quot;F&quot; suffix for or &quot;Naval&quot;) was introduced in 1984 as the original ship-based (naval) version of the S-300P system developed by &quot;Altair&quot;, with the new 5V55RM missile with range extended to and maximum target speed up to Mach 4, while the engagement altitude was reduced to . The naval version utilises the TOP SAIL or TOP STEER, TOP PAIR, and 3R41 Volna (TOP DOME) radar, and utilises command guidance with a terminal SARH mode. Its first installation and sea trials were on a and it is also installed on s and s. It is stored in eight (Slava) or twelve (Kirov) 8-missile rotary launchers below decks. The export version of this system is known as &quot;Rif&quot; ( or &quot;reef&quot;). The NATO name, found also in colloquial use, is &quot;Grumble&quot;.

==== Sea-based S-300FM (SA-N-20)====
The S-300FM &quot;Fort-M&quot; (, DoD designation &quot;SA-N-20&quot;) is another naval version of the system, installed only on the &quot;Kirov&quot;-class cruiser , and introducing the new 48N6 missile. It was introduced in 1990 and has a missile speed of approximately Mach 6 for a maximum target engagement speed of up to Mach 8.5, a warhead size of , an engagement range of , and an altitude envelope of . The new missiles also introduced a track-via-missile guidance method and the ability to intercept short-range ballistic missiles. This system makes use of the TOMB STONE MOD rather than TOP DOME radar. The export version is called the &quot;Rif-M&quot;. Two Rif-M systems were purchased by China in 2002 and installed on the Type 051C air-defence guided-missile destroyers.

===S-300V (SA-12)===

The S-300V, starting with the 9M83 missile, entered service in 1983, and it was fully integrated in 1988.

The 9K81 S-300V &quot;Antey-300&quot; ( – named after &quot;Antaeus&quot;, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-12 Gladiator/Giant&quot;) varies from the other designs in the series. It was built by Antey rather than Almaz, and its 9M82 and 9M83 missiles were designed by NPO Novator. The &quot;V&quot; suffix stands for &quot;Voyska&quot; (ground forces). It was designed to be the top-tier army air defence system, replacing the 2K11 Krug, providing a defence against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft. The 9M83 (SA-12A Gladiator) missiles have a maximum engagement range of around , while the 9M82 (SA-12B Giant) missiles can engage targets out to and up to altitudes of around . In both cases the warhead is around .

While it was created from the same project, hence sharing the common S-300 designation with the S-300P air defense family, the S-300V had different priorities that resulted in a different design. The S-300V system is carried on tracked MT-T transporters, which gives it better cross-country mobility than the S-300Ps moving on 8×8 wheeled transporters. Its search, tracking, and command systems are more distributed than the S-300P&#x27;s. For example, while both have mechanically scanning radar for target acquisition (9S15 &quot;BILL BOARD A&quot;), the battery level 9S32 &quot;GRILL PAN&quot; has an autonomous search ability and SARH delegated to illumination radar on transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles. The early 30N6 &quot;FLAP LID&quot; on the S-300P handles tracking and illumination, but is not equipped with an autonomous search capability (later upgraded). 9S15 can simultaneously carry out active (3 coordinates) and passive (2 positions) searches for targets.


The S-300V places a greater emphasis on the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) mission, with a dedicated 9M82 (SA-12B &quot;Giant&quot;) anti-ballistic missile. This missile is larger and only two can be on each TELAR. It also has a dedicated ABM radar: the 9S19 &quot;HIGH SCREEN&quot; phased-array radar at battalion level. A typical S-300V battalion consists of a target-detection-and-designation unit, a guidance radar, and up to 6 TELARs. The detection-and-designation unit consists of the 9S457-1 command post, a 9S15MV or 9S15MT &quot;BILL BOARD&quot; all-round surveillance radar, and a 9S19M2 &quot;HIGH SCREEN&quot; sector surveillance radar. The S-300V uses the 9S32-1 &quot;GRILL PAN&quot; multi-channel guidance radar. Four types of missile-launcher vehicles can be used with the system:
* Transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles, which not only transport the missiles, but also fire and guide them (including radar illumination and targeting.) There are two models: the 9A83-1 TELAR holding four 9M83 Gladiator missiles and the 9A82 TELAR holding two 9M82 Giant missiles.
* Launcher/loader vehicles (LLV), which transport the missiles and can reload the TELARs, and also fire missiles under the control of a TELAR. There are two models: the 9A84 LLV holding two 9M83 Gladiator missiles and the 9A85 LLV holding two 9M82 Giant missiles.

The target detection ranges for each radar vary based on the radar cross-section of the target:
* 9S15M – with a cross section and with a cross section.
* 9S19M2 – with an unknown cross-section; it contains two passive electronically scanned arrays with a very high resistance to interference.
* 9S32M (TELAR 9A82/9A83) – range is limited to , can work independently, or receive target designation from the S-300V, or a variety of other target designation data systems (AWACS aircraft and various ground-based radar). Targets with a radar cross-section of are detected at ranges up to and are locked on at . The 9S32 detection range against MGM-52 Lance missiles is , aircraft missiles , fighter or ballistic missile (MGM-31 Pershing) (all of which the U.S. removed from service in 1991).
* The ability to hit a target with a cross section of at a distance of (aiming system in the rocket (10/3 seconds before the missiles hit the target)). In addition, the guidance system inside the rocket supplements missile guidance systems commands from the 9A82 / 9A83 and 9S32, and the missile guidance systems to passively work with the radar illumination and radiation of the 9A82 / 9A83.

A S-300V system may be controlled by the upper level command post system 9S52 Polyana-D4 integrating it with the Buk missile system into a brigade.

China has built its own version of the S-300V called HQ-18.

===S-300VM (SA-23)===
The S-300VM (&quot;Antey 2500&quot;) is an upgrade of the S-300V. It consists of a new command-post vehicle, the 9S457ME, and a selection of new radars. These consist of the 9S15M2, 9S15MT2E, and 9S15MV2E all-round surveillance radars, and the 9S19ME sector surveillance radar. The upgraded guidance radar has the GRAU index of 9S32ME. The system can still employ up to six TELARs, the 9A84ME launchers (up to 4 9M83ME missiles), and up to 6 launcher/loader vehicles assigned to each launcher (2 9M83ME missiles each). An upgraded version, dubbed S-300V4, will be delivered to the Russian army in 2011.

The Antey-2500 complex is the export version developed separately from the S-300 family and has been exported to Venezuela for an estimated export price of US$1 billion. The system has one type of missile in two versions, basic and amended, with a sustainer stage that doubles the range (up to , according to other data, up to ), and can simultaneously engage up to 24 aircraft or 16 ballistic targets in various combinations.

It became the first system in the world capable of simultaneously engaging cruise missiles, aircraft, and ballistic targets. It also contains a private-sector radar for countering targets when affected by interference.

===S-300V4===
The S-300V4 is also called S-300VMD.
It was developed to target high-value airborne targets, such as AWACS aircraft, at long distances.
Different versions of the NPO Novator 9M82MD S-300V4 missiles have a range of at Mach 7.5 or a range of at Mach 9, and can destroy maneuvering targets even at very high altitudes.
An export version exists, marketed as the Antey-4000.

===S-400 (SA-21)===

The S-400 &quot;Triumf&quot; (, formerly known as the S-300PMU-3/С-300ПМУ-3, NATO reporting name &quot;SA-21 Growler&quot;) was introduced in 1999 and featured a new, larger missile and several upgrades and new features. The project encountered delays since its original announcement, and deployment only began on a small scale in 2006. With an engagement range of up to , depending on the missile variant used, it was specifically designed to counter stealth aircraft. It is by far the most advanced version, incorporating the ability to survive PGM threats and counter advanced jammers by using automatic frequency hopping.

==Specifications==
S-300 variants will work together in various combinations, although interoperability between different variants is limited. Various higher-level mobile commands can coordinate certain variants at various locations into a single battery, and also integrate that battery with other air defence systems. A management system, consisting of command control and radars allows for fully automatic initiation and effective management of up to one hundred targets located up to from the base station. Many tasks – detection, tracking, target setting, target designation, target acquisition, missile guidance, and assessment of results – can be dealt with automatically. The operator controls the target detection and the launch of rockets. In a complex environment, manual intervention is possible. Few of the previous systems possessed such capabilities.

The S-300 is a multi-channel anti-aircraft missile system whose variants can engage ballistic missiles as well as aircraft and are able to allocate up to 12 missiles to up to 6 different targets. The system can destroy ground targets at a range of , and when launched on a ballistic trajectory, can reach up to . Its vertically-launched missiles allow for the engagement of flying targets in any direction without traversing the launcher.

Early versions are guided by the 30N6 FLAP LID or naval 3R41 Volna (TOP DOME) radar using command guidance with terminal semi-active radar homing. Later versions use the 30N6 FLAP LID B or TOMB STONE radar to guide the missiles via command guidance/seeker-aided ground guidance (SAGG), similar to the U.S.-made Patriot&#x27;s TVM guidance scheme. The earlier 30N6 FLAP LID A can guide up to four missiles at a time to up to four targets, and can track up to 24 targets at once. The 30N6E FLAP LID B can guide up to two missiles per target to up to six targets simultaneously. Early models can successfully engage targets flying at up to Mach 2.5, or around Mach 8.5 for later models, with one missile potentially being launched every three seconds. The mobile control centre is able to manage up to 12 TELs simultaneously.

The original warhead weighed , intermediate warheads weighed , and the latest warhead weighs . Each warhead is equipped with a proximity fuse and a contact fuse. A warhead will expel from 19,000 to 36,000 metal fragments upon detonation, depending on missile type. The missiles themselves weigh between . Missiles are catapulted clear of the launching tubes before their rocket motors fire, and can accelerate at up to 100 &quot;g&quot; (1 km/s2). They launch straight upwards and then tip over towards their target, removing the need to aim the missiles before launch. The missiles are steered with a combination of control fins and thrust vectoring vanes. The sections below give exact specifications of the radar and missiles in the different S-300 versions. Since the S-300PM, most vehicles are interchangeable across variations.

===Radar===
The 30N6 FLAP LID A is mounted on a small trailer. The 64N6 BIG BIRD is mounted on a large trailer along with a generator and is typically towed with an 8-wheeled truck. The 76N6 CLAM SHELL (5N66M etc.) is mounted on a large trailer with a mast that is between tall. It is usually used with a mast. With the mast, it has a target detection range of if altitude of the target is above the ground.

The original S-300P utilises a combination of the 5N66M continuous-wave radar Doppler radar for target acquisition and the 30N6 FLAP LID A I/J-band phased-array digitally-steered tracking-and-engagement radar. Both are mounted on trailers. In addition, there is a trailer-mounted command centre and up to twelve trailer-mounted erector/launchers with four missiles each. The S-300PS/PM is similar but uses an upgraded 30N6 tracking-and-engagement radar with an integrated command post and has truck-mounted TELs.

If the battery was employed in an anti-ballistic-missile or anti-cruise-missile role, the 64N6 BIG BIRD E/F-band radar would also be included. It is capable of detecting ballistic missiles up to away, travelling at up to , and cruise missiles up to away. It also employs electronic-beam steering and performs a scan once every twelve seconds.

The 36D6 TIN SHIELD radar can also be used to augment the S-300 system to provide earlier target detection than the FLAP LID radar allows. It can detect a missile-sized target flying at an altitude of at least away, at an altitude of at least away, and at high altitude up to away. In addition a 64N6 BIG BIRD E/F band target-acquisition radar can be used, which has a maximum detection range of .

The S-300 FC Radar Flap Lid can be mounted on a standard pylon.

===Missiles===

===Means of camouflage and protection===
Decoys – sometimes equipped with additional devices to simulate electromagnetic radiation in the infrared, optical, and radar - are used for imitating components of S-300 system.

Additional means of masking are used, such as MKT-2, MKT-3 and Volchitsa-KR camouflage nets.

34Ya6E Gazetchik-E system might be used for protection against anti-radiation missiles. A combined MAWS/decoy/aerosole/chaff system is claimed by the developer to have the 85% to 95% probability to defeat a single attacking HARM missile. SPN-30 and Pelena-1 radar jamming systems are also used against airborne radars.

When using a prepared position for prolonged time, revetments might be used for TELs and additional equipment.

== Comparison with other systems ==
==Operational history==
Russian officials have stated that the system has performed well in real-world exercises.
In 1991, 1992, and 1993, various versions of the S-300 destroyed ballistic missiles and other objects in exercises, with a high success rate (90% or more if 1 missile interceptor is used).

In 1995, it was the first system to destroy a R-17 Elbrus Scud missile in the air.
China is to test the S-300PMU2&#x27;s effectiveness in destroying targets in real exercises. The planned targets include a UAV (), a simulated strategic bomber (), tactical missiles (range of the system to the point of interception and a height of ), and pinpoint missiles. In April 2005, NATO held a combat exercise in France and Germany called &quot;Trial Hammer 05&quot; to practice Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses missions. The Slovak Air Force brought an S-300PMU along, providing an opportunity for NATO to become familiar with the system.

Israel&#x27;s purchase of F-35 Lightning II fighters was allegedly intended in part to nullify the threat of S-300 missiles that were, at the time the fighters were initially sought, part of a potential arms sale to Iran. The fighter jets were eventually deployed by Israel in late October 2024 and disabled Iran&#x27;s last three S-300 batteries in the first wave in a three-waved airstrike, thereby severely compromising Iran&#x27;s air defenses.

In 2010, Russia announced that its military had deployed the S-300 systems in breakaway Abkhazia in 2008, leading to condemnation from the government of Georgia.

===Syria===
After a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down over Syria in November 2015, Russia deployed S-300 and S-400 systems to the region – some to the Khmeimim Air Base, some with the .

On 17 September 2018, a Syrian S-200 system downed a Russian military plane, killing 15 Russian service members. Moscow accused Israel of indirectly causing this incident, and announced that to keep its troops safe, it would supply Syria with modern S-300 anti-missile rocket systems. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu objected to the move in a telephone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin, stating that the delivery of S-300 anti-missile rocket systems to &quot;irresponsible players&quot; would be dangerous for the region.

In 2020, Syrian military officials criticized the S-300 air defense systems supplied by Russia, saying they failed to protect Syrian sites from Israeli strikes. One official criticized the detection abilities of the system&#x27;s radar.

On 17 May 2022, Israel said that a Russian-operated S-300 missile system fired a missile at a F-16 operated by the IAF. If confirmed, it would be the first time Russian forces have fired on Israeli jets. According to Channel 13 news, Russia fired 13 missiles at an Israeli F-16, but none of the jets were intercepted by the missile salvos. On 26 July, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz confirmed the initial report of one missile being fired by a Russian-operated S-300 system. However, he downplayed the incident as a &quot;one-off&quot;, further stating that &quot;our jets weren&#x27;t even in the area&quot;. As the missile had not locked on, it was no threat to Israeli jets. It still remains the first use of an S-300 against the Israeli Air Force.

===2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict===
During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the S-300 system took active part in an armed conflict for the first time, different versions being listed in the active inventory of both sides. The Armenian systems were initially deployed around Yerevan.
On 29 September 2020, Azerbaijan reported that Armenia was moving its S-300 systems closer to the conflict zone, and vowed their destruction. On 30 September 2020, Azerbaijani Armed Forces claimed the destruction of an Armenian S-300 system without providing further details.
The first alleged combat firing of the S-300 happened during the night between 1 and 2 October when the Armenian Ministry of Defense claimed that Armenian S-300s had downed three Azerbaijani drones (not missiles as initially claimed) bound for Yerevan.

On 17 October 2020, Azerbaijani Armed Forces claimed the destruction of two radar elements that were part of an active Armenian S-300 SAM site being hit by a Bayraktar TB2 UCAV.

===2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
At the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Ukraine had around 100 active S-300 batteries with as many as 300 launchers inherited upon the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. By 8 April, the Russians had knocked out at least 21 of the S-300 launchers that outside analysts confirmed with photos or videos, with the actual total of destroyed launchers likely higher. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in his message of 16 March to the U.S. Congress, had consequently asked specifically for help acquiring more of the long-range missiles. &quot;You know what kind of defense systems we need: S-300 and other similar systems&quot;, Zelenskyy said.

The United States and its allies tried to figure out how to deliver S-300s to Ukraine. One plan was for Slovakia to transfer to Ukraine its single battery of S-300s, in exchange for the United States or some other country supplying Slovakia with a new air-defense system, such as the American-made Patriot. A few days after Zelenskyy asked for S-300s, Germany agreed to deploy some of its Patriots to Slovakia, as part of a NATO battlegroup.

On 30 March, Prime Minister Eduard Heger of Slovakia told CNN that he supported sending some of his country&#x27;s own S-300s to Ukraine &quot;because this is the equipment that Ukraine needs the most&quot;. On 8 April, U.S. President Joe Biden confirmed that Slovakia had transferred a Soviet-era S-300 system to Ukraine and said that the U.S. would reposition an American Patriot missile system to Slovakia in return. It appears that only one battery that was donated, which was a system that Slovakia inherited from the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993.

On 11 April, the Associated Press reported Russia&#x27;s claims to have destroyed several air defense systems in Ukraine over the previous two days, indicating a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv described as crucial, ahead of a broad new Russian offensive in the east. Moscow claimed to have hit four S-300 missile launchers provided by a European country it did not name, but never showed any concrete evidence of that. Slovakia had given Ukraine such a system the previous week, but denied that it had been destroyed. Russia previously reported two strikes on similar systems in other places.

In early April, Iran also reportedly returned a large number of S-300 systems, for use against Ukraine, which it had purchased from Russia in 2007, along with a quantity of its own Iranian-made version, the Bavar-373, which has similar capabilities. Iran Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian refuted allegations of arms transfers to Russia in a call with Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

On 8 July, the governor of the Mykolaiv Oblast, Vitaly Kim, claimed that Russia had been using S-300 missiles in a land-attack role by fitting them with GPS guidance and that some 12 missiles were fired using such guidance. On 30 September, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported the claim of Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to President Zelenskyy, that 16 Russian S-300 missiles configured for ground-attack struck near Zaporizhzhia, killing at least 30 civilians and wounding 50 others. Debris from S-300 missiles was found after having struck buildings in Kharkiv on 8 October. Analysts from McKenzie Intelligence Services and the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that these missiles were likely from Russian systems repurposed for ground attack due to the dwindling stock of more precise dedicated anti-surface missiles.

Stationary surface targets do not necessarily require retrofitting, as the original design accommodates them – particularly those that emit radiation, such as radars, which S-300 missiles can target precisely with onboard radiation tracking. However, some of the reported surface-to-surface missile strikes by S-300 missiles may actually be instances of Ukrainian S-300s failing to intercept targets, and subsequently falling onto civilian areas on the ground. The most notable case of such unintentional strikes occurred on 15 November 2022, when a stray S-300 missile on a ballistic trajectory fell near the village of Przewodow in Poland, killing 2.

On 14 April 2023, Sloviansk was hit by seven S-300 missiles, which killed at least 11 people. Russian S-300 strikes in Pokrovsk Raion on 6 January 2024 killed 11 and injured 8 according to local officials.

On 10 June 2024, Ukrainian forces have launched an attack near Chornomorskiy in Crimea destroying S-300 missile launchers.

On 21 August 2024, the Ukrainian military claimed to have struck a Russian S-300 air defense system in Rostov Oblast possibly with a Neptune missile.

==Operators and other versions==


The S-300 is mainly used in Eastern Europe and Asia, although sources are inconsistent about which countries possess the system.

* – 8 regiments of S-300PMU2
* – 50 systems, unknown variant
* bought two S-300PMU2 (SA-20B) SAM battalions for US$300 million in 2010, delivered in 2011
* – S-300PS systems delivered from Russia in 2007 to replace older S-300 model in the Belarusian inventory. Four divisions of S-300 missiles to be delivered in 2014.
* – 8 S-300 launchers in service as of 2024. Divided into 2 units with 6 launchers each .
* – China first acquired the S-300PMU-1 in 1993, and later became the first customer of the S-300PMU-2, in 2004. China also built the HQ-15 with the maximum range upgraded from . The total number of the S-300PMU/1/2 and HQ-15/18 batteries in the PLA are approximately 40 and 60, respectively, as of 2008. The total number of the missiles is well above 1,600, with about 300 launcher platforms. Five such SAM battalions are deployed and in active duty around the Beijing region, six battalions are in the Taiwan strait region, and the rest are in major cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, and Dalian. Two Rif (SA-N-6) systems were purchased in 2002 for the Chinese Navy&#x27;s Type 051C destroyers. By 2011, China had obtained 15 battalions (4 systems) of the S-300PMU-2.
* – The S-300VM &quot;Antey-2500&quot; missile system was ordered in 2014, as part of a billion-dollar Egyptian-Russian arms deal signed later that year. The $1 billion contract comprises 4 batteries, a command post and other external elements. In 2015, Russia started delivering the system components, and Egyptian soldiers began their training in Russian training centers. By the end of 2017, all batteries had been delivered to Egypt. Russia is in talks with Egypt on the delivery of additional Antey-2500 systems.
* – Originally purchased in 2007. Russia maintained a self-imposed ban on the sale of the S-300 until the easing of some US sanctions as part of the Iran nuclear deal framework in April 2015 and subsequent Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Iran received four S-300PMU2 batteries from Russia in 2016, each consisting of a 96L6E target-acquisition radar, a 30N6E2 target-engagement radar, and four 5P85TE2 towed transporter-erector-launchers (TELs). The systems are supported by two 64N6E2 battle-management radars and linked using FL-95 antenna masts. The S-300s are operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force. During air strikes on military targets in Iran in April and on Oct. 26 2024, Israeli aircraft disabled all of Iran&#x27;s Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems after Iranian radar systems were “breached” causing their screens to freeze.
* – 10 battalions after the refurbishment (PS – version) (2009 or later), 5 free of charge (2014), and 5 free of charge (2015).
* – North Korea has conducted tests with a system called KN-06.
* – All variations. (1900 (S-300PT/PS/PMU, 200 S-300V/S-300V1 in 2010)), 2000 total launchers. All production in 1994 (actually 1990) or older, all the S-300PM complexes have been repairing and upgrading (Favorit-S). The S-300P/PT has been retired before 2008, some S-300PS are in service, but were to be retired in 2012–2013. Modernization of all S-300P units to the S-300PM1 version was to end in 2014. The useful life of each was increased by 5 years. PM 1 was upgraded to version PM 2. By 2015, the S-300V4 was to have been delivered. Modernization of all S-300Vs to S-300V4s was to end in 2012.
* – S-300PT, S-300PS, S-300PMU, S-300V1. Only six systems were kept in working order between 2004 and 2014; as a result, only 40% of Ukrainian S-300 systems were in good condition prior to 2014. Due to the war with Russia, Ukraine started repairing and bringing back to service several armaments, including several S-300 batteries, with at least 4 batteries overhauled in 2014–15. 34 launchers remained in Crimea after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country had around 100 batteries. It received an additional battery from Slovakia in April 2022.
* – Ordered 2 battalions of S-300VM &quot;Antey-2500&quot;, which were delivered in May 2012.
* – Bought two S-300PMU-1 systems (12 launchers) for nearly $300 million and RLS 96L6 after 2009. The systems were likely upgraded to the S-300PMU2 standard.

===Former operators===
* – One battalion created in 1990. Passed to Slovakia in 1993.
* – One S-300PMU system delivered in 1989. Inspected by West German Air Force personnel in late August 1990. Returned to the Soviet Union in September 1990 as &quot;sensitive technology&quot; after negotiations between East Germany and the USSR.
* – An S-300 PMU1 system acquired after the Cyprus Missile Crisis and operated by HAF on Crete, consisting of 1 regiment/4 systems/8 fire units/32 launchers / 175 missiles. Greece first fired an S-300 during the White Eagle 2013 military exercise, which was the first time it was used since it had been bought 15 years earlier. According to Greek Defence Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos Greece was prepared to transfer its S-300 system to Ukraine in exchange for a PAC-3 Patriot missile system. Additionally stating that: &quot;The same procedure applies to any other Russian made air defense system that they may want to send to Ukraine.&quot; However, ultimately, the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis denied Greece&#x27;s preparedness to send the S-300 to Ukraine for concerns that this move would create a gap in Greece&#x27;s air defence. Despite initially being wanted by Ukraine, the Hellenic Air Force will be sending the S-300 to Armenia.
* – One S-300PMU battery and 48 5V55R missiles inherited from Czechoslovakia. 3 missiles were fired during an exercise in Bulgaria in 2015. The battery was donated to Ukraine in April 2022 in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* – An order for 6 systems was signed in 2010. Syrian crews underwent training in Russia, and some of the S-300 components were delivered to Syria in 2013. Later, due to the weapons embargo against Syria and at the request of Israel, the deliveries were halted. After the Russian Su-24 shootdown in November 2015, S-300 missile batteries were officially deployed to Latakia province for the protection of the Russian naval base and warships at Tartus. These are operated by Russian crews. Russia was reconsidering deliveries of the S-300 to Syria after the missile strikes against Syria in April 2018, but this did not happen. Following the Syrian military&#x27;s downing of a Russian Il-20 aircraft in Syria in September 2018, using a S-200 system (for which Russia held Israel responsible), Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu on 24 September said that within two weeks, the Syrian Army would receive S-300 systems. Though the S-300 variant was not specified, the stated range of the system was to be . On 2 October 2018, Shoigu told President Putin during a broadcast meeting that the delivery of the S-300 system to Syria had been completed a day prior. On 8 October 2018, the Russian news agency TASS reported that three S-300PM battalions had been given to Syria free of charge, citing &quot;On 1 October three battalion sets of S-300PM systems of eight launchers each were delivered to Syria&quot;. According to the source, the deliveries also included more than 100 surface-to-air missiles for each battalion. It is operated by the Syrian Air Defense Force. In 2022, the systems were removed from Syria.
* – Passed onto successor states.

=== Evaluation-only operators ===
* – S-300P, devoid of electronics, purchased from Belarus in 1994. S-300V was purchased in Russia officially in the 1990s (complete set (except for 9S32 GRILL PAN multi-channel guidance radar)).

===Cancelled===
* – S-300 PMU1 system transferred to Greece after the Cyprus Missile Crisis and operated by the HAF on Crete.

<text>The pharyngeal reflex or gag reflex is a reflex muscular contraction of the back of the throat, evoked by touching the roof of the mouth, back of the tongue, area around the tonsils, uvula, and back of the throat. It, along with other aerodigestive reflexes such as reflexive pharyngeal swallowing, prevents objects in the oral cavity from entering the throat except as part of normal swallowing and helps prevent choking, and is a form of coughing. The pharyngeal reflex is different from the laryngeal spasm, which is a reflex muscular contraction of the vocal cords.

==Reflex arc==
In a reflex arc, a series of physiological steps occur very rapidly to produce a reflex. Generally, a sensory receptor receives an environmental stimulus, in this case from objects reaching nerves in the back of the throat, and sends a message via an afferent nerve to the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS receives this message and sends an appropriate response via an efferent nerve (also known as a motor neuron) to effector cells located in the same initial area that can then carry out the appropriate response.

In the case of the pharyngeal reflex: 
*the sensory limb is mediated predominantly by CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve)
*the motor limb by CN X (vagus nerve).

The gag reflex involves a brisk and brief elevation of the soft palate and bilateral contraction of pharyngeal muscles evoked by touching the posterior pharyngeal wall. Touching the soft palate can lead to a similar reflex response. However, in that case, the sensory limb of the reflex is the CN V (trigeminal nerve). In very sensitive individuals, much more of the brain stem may be involved; a simple gag may enlarge to retching and vomiting in some.

==Suppression and activation==
Swallowing unusually large objects or placing objects in the back of the mouth may cause the pharyngeal reflex. Some people, for instance sword swallowers, have learned how to suppress it. In contrast, triggering the reflex is sometimes done intentionally to induce vomiting, by those who have bulimia nervosa.

According to one study, one in three people lacks a gag reflex. However, on the other end of the spectrum are people with a hypersensitive gag reflex. This hypersensitivity can lead to issues in various situations, such as swallowing a pill or large bites of food, or visiting the dentist. Hypersensitivity is generally a conditioned response, usually occurring following a previous experience. There are a variety of ways to desensitize one&#x27;s hypersensitivity, from relaxation to numbing the mouth and throat to training one&#x27;s soft palate to get used to being touched.

Anti-nausea medicines, sedatives, local and general anaesthetics, herbal remedies, behavioural therapies, acupressure, acupuncture, laser, and prosthetic devices can be used to manage exaggerated gag reflex during dental treatment. Studies showed with very low‐certainty evidence that acupuncture and laser at the P6 point (located in the wrist) reduced gagging without sedation. However, there was no difference when practiced with sedation. Therefore, more research needs to be carried out regarding these interventions.

Some people seem to be able to completely stop their gag reflex for a short time by pressing certain pressure points, even without prior training.

==Absence==
In certain cases, absence of the gag reflex and pharyngeal sensation can be a symptom of a number of severe medical conditions, such as damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve, the vagus nerve, or brain death.

In unilateral (one-sided) glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX - sensory component) damage, there will be no gag response when touching the pharyngeal wall on the same side of the damaged nerve.
With one-sided vagal nerve (CN X - motor component) damage, the soft palate will elevate and pull toward the intact side regardless of the side of the pharynx that is touched. This is because the sensory component is intact on both sides, but only the motor nerves supplying one side of the soft palatine and pharyngeal muscles is working, therefore the contraction of the muscles in the reflex is asymmetrical. 
If both CN IX and X are damaged on one side (not uncommon), stimulation of the normal side elicits only a unilateral response, with deviation of the soft palate to that side; no consensual response is seen. Touching the damaged side produces no response at all.

At one point, it was thought that a lack of the gag reflex in stroke patients was a good predictor for dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing) or laryngeal aspiration (food or drink entering the larynx), and was therefore commonly checked for. However, in one study, 37% of healthy people did not have a gag reflex, yet all subjects except for one still retained an intact pharyngeal sensation. These results suggest that the muscles that control the gag reflex remain independent of those that control normal swallowing. Since this reflex is commonly not found in healthy people, its predictive value in determining the risk for swallowing disorders is severely limited. Pharyngeal sensation, on the other hand, as seen by this study, is rarely absent, and could prove better at predicting future problems with swallowing.

==Reflexive pharyngeal swallow==
Closely related to the gag reflex, in which food or other foreign substances are forced back out of the pharynx, swallowing generally pushes food through the digestive system into the stomach. This reflex in particular functions as a protective system for the upper respiratory tract as it not only forces the glottis to close, thereby preventing any substances getting into the airways, but also clears the pharynx of any residual substances by a swallow.

This particular reflex is simply one of several aerodigestive reflexes, including also the pharyngoglottal closure reflex (in which no swallowing occurs, yet the glottis still closes) and the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex, which occurs mainly during gastroesophageal reflux episodes. All either forcibly close the glottis or allow the pharynx to remove particles into the digestive tract that may have been forced back up by both this tract and the upper respiratory tract. These reflexes can also protect the airways from any food or liquids that may spill over from the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is the bottom part of the pharynx, and can be considered the first area where the digestive tract splits from the airways. However, if the maximum capacity of fluids that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded, then this excess fluid spills into the larynx and from there into the lungs. Therefore, these reflexes prevent levels reaching this maximum volume.

Since both the digestive system and the respiratory system are connected by the pharynx, there are many problems and diseases that occur when the body is unable to regulate passage of food and air into the appropriate tracts. Perhaps the most preventable cause of damage to these reflexes originates from smoking. One study has shown that, when compared to non-smokers, the threshold volumes (the lowest volume at which one of these reflexes is triggered) for both the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex and reflexive pharyngeal swallowing is increased.

<text>Ore is a large suburb of the urban area of Hastings, in the Hastings district, in the county of East Sussex, England. Formerly a village, it is still known and advertised locally as &quot;Ore Village&quot;. It is located to the north-east of Hastings town centre, on the main A259 road to Rye. Its name may have originated from the Old English word for &quot;stream-bank&quot;. The Ore Stream still runs through a large central Woodland area known locally as Speckled Wood at the top of the Valley.
It is the largest suburb of Hastings.

Ore Valley lies to the west of Ore Village, and is the site of Ore Railway Station and the former Broomgrove power station. It is also the site of the Hastings Millennium Community regeneration project.

==Rail transport==
Ore Railway Station (one mile from Ore main street/Ore Village) lies on the Marshlink Line; with the former maintenance depot for the trains from London, and the coast (via the East Coastway Line and Hastings Line). Ore station lies northeast of Hastings station and south of Three Oaks (formerly Three Oaks and Guestling Halt).

The routes available from Ore Railway Station include: Ashford Intl - Eastbourne, Ore - London Victoria, Ore - Brighton

==Religious institutions==
Ore is divided into two ecclesiastical parishes, and so has two Anglican Parish Churches; these are Christ Church, Ore, and St Helen&#x27;s, Ore. The latter gives its name (St Helens) to a distinct district of the Ore community. The church was built in 1868, to replace an ancient church dating from the reign of Edward III, which now stands in ruins nearby.

Other religious buildings in Ore include a Seventh-day Adventist Church, Clifton Road Methodist church, and a Salvation Army unit. Hastings cemetery and crematorium, with its own chapel, is situated in the St Helens area of Ore.

==Education==
Ore Valley has the Ore Valley Campus of Sussex Coast College Hastings on Parker Road.
Hastings Academy is in the nearby Red Lake district of Ore.

Primary schools:
* All Saints CE Junior
* Blacklands CP
* The Baird Primary Academy (formerly known as Elphinstone Junior school)
* Ore Village Primary Academy (formerly known as Red Lake Community Primary School)
* Sacred Heart RC
* Sandown CP

Secondary schools:
* Ark Alexandra Academy
* Hastings Academy

== Civil parish ==
In 1951 the parish had a population of 355. On 1 April 1958 the parish was abolished and merged with Guestling and Westfield.

<text>Cawsand (; lit. &quot;Cow Cove&quot;) and Kingsand (Cornish: &quot;Porthruw&quot;) are twin villages in southeast Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village is situated on the Rame Peninsula and is in the parish of Maker-with-Rame.

Cawsand overlooks Plymouth Sound and adjoins Kingsand, formerly on the border of Devon and Cornwall (the border has since been moved and now is situated on the River Tamar). Cawsand has two public houses: the Cross Keys Inn on Armada Road, not trading and for sale in September 2022, and the Bay bar, overlooking Cawsand beach.

Cawsand is within Mount Edgcumbe Country Park. There are frequent bus services to the city of Plymouth which is three miles to the north across Plymouth Sound. There is also a ferry service in the summer (from Cawsand Bay to Plymouth Hoe) and a pilot gig club (Rame Gig Club).

The Rame Peninsula is considered part of the Forgotten Corner of Cornwall.

== Geology ==
Cawsand Beach is sand and shingle with a network of rockpools and is found along The Bound.

==History==
The settlement is first recorded in 1404.

In 1596, local militia repelled an attack by Spanish forces and defences were built soon after. Cawsand Fort (at ) is sited just above the village. The fort is an 1860s Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom fort built on the site of a 1779 battery to mount about 10 guns to cover the western entrance to Plymouth Sound by the breakwater. Released by the Ministry of Defence in 1926, it remained derelict until it was converted into residential accommodation.

Correspondence from 1801 to 1803 shows that Admiral Nelson had stayed in Cawsand and it is rumoured that he had dined at the Ship Inn, which burned down in 2013 after several years of abandonment. The site has been cleared and is now being rebuilt by The Peninsula Trust which plans to turn the site into a cafe and affordable housing.
== Religion ==
St Andrew&#x27;s Church was built as a chapel of ease in 1877–78. It is a Grade II listed building.

Originally built in 1793, Cawsand also has a Congregational Church.

==Notable people==
* John Pollard, Royal Navy officer
* Thomas Ball Sullivan, Royal Navy officer
* Daniel Tyerman, missionary

==Twinning==

Cawsand is twinned with Porspoder in Brittany, France.

<doc id="546120" wikidata="Q2797953" url="?curid=546120" title="Recurrence plot">
<text>In descriptive statistics and chaos theory, a recurrence plot (RP) is a plot showing, for each moment formula_1 in time, the times at which the state of a dynamical system returns to the previous state at formula_2,
i.e., when the phase space trajectory visits roughly the same area in the phase space as at time formula_1. In other words, it is a plot of

:formula_4

showing formula_2 on a horizontal axis and formula_1 on a vertical axis, where formula_7 is the state of the system (or its phase space trajectory).

==Background==

Natural processes can have a distinct recurrent behaviour, e.g. periodicities (as seasonal or Milankovich cycles), but also irregular cyclicities (as El Niño Southern Oscillation, heart beat intervals). Moreover, the recurrence of states, in the meaning that states are again arbitrarily close after some time of divergence, is a fundamental property of deterministic dynamical systems and is typical for nonlinear or chaotic systems (cf. Poincaré recurrence theorem). The recurrence of states in nature has been known for a long time and has also been discussed in early work (e.g. Henri Poincaré 1890).

==Detailed description==

One way to visualize the recurring nature of states by their trajectory through a phase space is the recurrence plot, introduced by Eckmann et al. (1987). Often, the phase space does not have a low enough dimension (two or three) to be pictured, since higher-dimensional phase spaces can only be visualized by projection into the two or three-dimensional sub-spaces. One frequently used tool to study the behaviour of such phase space trajectories is then the Poincaré map. Another tool, is the recurrence plot, which enables us to investigate many aspects of the &quot;m&quot;-dimensional phase space trajectory through a two-dimensional representation.

At a recurrence the trajectory returns to a location (state) in phase space it has visited before up to a small error formula_8 . The recurrence plot represents the collection of pairs of times of such recurrences, i.e., the set of formula_9 with formula_10, with formula_2 and formula_1 discrete points of time and formula_13 the state of the system at time formula_2 (location of the trajectory at time formula_2). 
Mathematically, this is expressed by the binary recurrence matrix

:formula_16

where formula_17 is a norm and formula_8 the recurrence threshold. An alternative, more formal expression is using the Heaviside step function formula_19
with formula_20 the norm of distance vector between formula_13 and formula_22.
Alternative recurrence definitions consider different distances formula_23, e.g., angular distance, fuzzy distance, or edit distance.

The recurrence plot visualises formula_24 with coloured (mostly black) dot at coordinates formula_9 if formula_26, with time at the formula_27- and formula_28-axes.

If only a univariate time series formula_29 is available, the phase space can be reconstructed, e.g., by using a time delay embedding (see Takens&#x27; theorem):

:formula_30

where formula_31 is the time series (with formula_32 and formula_33 the sampling time), formula_34 the embedding dimension and formula_35 the time delay. However, phase space reconstruction is not essential part of the recurrence plot (although often stated in literature), because it is based on phase space trajectories which could be derived from the system&#x27;s variables directly (e.g., from the three variables of the Lorenz system) or from multivariate data.

The visual appearance of a recurrence plot gives hints about the dynamics of the system. Caused by characteristic behaviour of the phase space trajectory, a recurrence plot contains typical small-scale structures, as single dots, diagonal lines and vertical/horizontal lines (or a mixture of the latter, which combines to extended clusters). The large-scale structure, also called &quot;texture&quot;, can be visually characterised by &quot;homogenous&quot;, &quot;periodic&quot;, &quot;drift&quot; or &quot;disrupted&quot;. For example, the plot can show if the trajectory is strictly periodic with period formula_36, then all such pairs of times will be separated by a multiple of formula_36 and visible as diagonal lines.

The small-scale structures in recurrence plots contain information about certain characteristics of the dynamics of the underlying system. For example, the length of the diagonal lines visible in the recurrence plot are related to the divergence of phase space trajectories, thus, can represent information about the chaoticity. Therefore, the recurrence quantification analysis quantifies the distribution of these small-scale structures. This quantification can be used to describe the recurrence plots in a quantitative way. Applications are classification, predictions, nonlinear parameter estimation, and transition analysis. In contrast to the heuristic approach of the recurrence quantification analysis, which depends on the choice of the embedding parameters, some dynamical invariants as correlation dimension, K2 entropy or mutual information, which are independent on the embedding, can also be derived from recurrence plots. The base for these dynamical invariants are the recurrence rate and the distribution of the lengths of the diagonal lines. More recent applications use recurrence plots as a tool for time series imaging in machine learning approaches and studying spatio-temporal recurrences.

Close returns plots are similar to recurrence plots. The difference is that the relative time between recurrences is used for the formula_28-axis (instead of absolute time).

The main advantage of recurrence plots is that they provide useful information even for short and non-stationary data, where other methods fail.

==Extensions==

Multivariate extensions of recurrence plots were developed as cross recurrence plots and joint recurrence plots.

Cross recurrence plots consider the phase space trajectories of two different systems in the same phase space:

:formula_39

The dimension of both systems must be the same, but the number of considered states (i.e. data length) can be different. Cross recurrence plots compare the occurrences of &quot;similar states&quot; of two systems. They can be used in order to analyse the similarity of the dynamical evolution between two different systems, to look for similar matching patterns in two systems, or to study the time-relationship of two similar systems, whose time-scale differ.

Joint recurrence plots are the Hadamard product of the recurrence plots of the considered sub-systems, e.g. for two systems formula_7 and formula_41 the joint recurrence plot is

:formula_42

In contrast to cross recurrence plots, joint recurrence plots compare the simultaneous occurrence of &quot;recurrences&quot; in two (or more) systems. Moreover, the dimension of the considered phase spaces can be different, but the number of the considered states has to be the same for all the sub-systems. Joint recurrence plots can be used in order to detect phase synchronisation.

<doc id="546125" wikidata="Q680185" url="?curid=546125" title="Joe Simpson (mountaineer)">
<text>Joe Simpson (born 13 August 1960) is a British mountaineer, author, and motivational speaker. While climbing in Peru in 1985, he suffered severe injuries and was assumed dead by his climbing companion Simon Yates after falling into a crevasse, but he survived and managed to crawl back to his base camp. He described the ordeal in his 1988 book &quot;Touching the Void&quot;, which has been adapted into a 2003 documentary film and a 2018 stage play, both of the same name.

==Early life==
Simpson was born on 13 August 1960 to a Scottish father and an Irish mother, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where his father was stationed with the British Army. From the age of 8, Simpson travelled between schools in Britain and various countries where his father was stationed. Simpson began rock climbing after being introduced to the sport at Peak Scar on the Hambleton Hills in north-eastern Yorkshire by a teacher at Ampleforth College. He was 14 when he read &quot;The White Spider&quot; by Heinrich Harrer, about the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger by Harrer with Anderl Heckmair, Fritz Kasparek, and Ludwig Vörg in 1938. Despite the inherent dangers of mountaineering described in the book, this reading sparked a passion for the mountains in Simpson.

==Climbing career==

In 1985, Simpson and his climbing partner Simon Yates made a first ascent of the previously unclimbed west face of Siula Grande (6,344 m) in the Cordillera Huayhuash of the Peruvian Andes. On the descent, Simpson broke his right leg in a fall. Yates attempted to rescue Simpson by roping the pair together, with Yates lowering Simpson as far down the mountain as their rope would allow, before descending himself, and repeating the process. However, as weather conditions deteriorated and visibility diminished, he unknowingly lowered Simpson over a cliff edge. Simpson could not climb up the rope, and it was impossible for Yates to pull him up due to his own precarious position. To avoid being pulled off the mountain himself, Yates was forced to cut the rope. Simpson, however, succeeded in rescuing himself and survived. After they returned to Britain, Yates received some criticism for having cut the rope.

Simpson published an article about the Siula Grande ordeal in the climbing press shortly afterwards, and later wrote the best-selling book &quot;Touching the Void&quot;. The book has been translated into 23 languages and has sold almost two million copies worldwide. Simpson wrote further about the Siula Grande expedition in his book &quot;This Game of Ghosts&quot; as did Yates in his book &quot;Against the Wall&quot;. A film based on the book was released in 2003. It takes the form of a docudrama with climbing sequences filmed in the European Alps and the Peruvian Andes together with interviews with Simpson, Yates and the third member of the expedition Richard Hawking (a non-climber).

Simpson underwent six surgical operations as a result of the leg injuries sustained on Siula Grande. Doctors told him he would never climb again and that he would have trouble walking for the rest of his life. In 1987, however, he returned to mountain climbing.

== Later activities ==
His later non-fiction books describe other expeditions and his changing feeling towards extreme mountaineering brought on by the many deaths that surround the pursuit. A bad fall broke Simpson&#x27;s left ankle while climbing with Mal Duff in 1991 on Pachermo in Nepal, and is described in his third book &quot;This Game of Ghosts&quot;. Simpson also made six unsuccessful attempts on the North Face of the Eiger from 2000 to 2003 with his regular climbing partner Ray Delaney, all of which had to be aborted due to bad weather. One of his books, &quot;The Beckoning Silence&quot;, was made into a documentary shown on Channel 4 in October 2007. The book won the 2003 National Outdoor Book Award (Outdoor Literature category).

<text>Simon Yates (born 1963) is an English mountaineer. He has described himself as &#x27;an adventurer&#x27;. Yates is most well known as being one of two British mountaineers that conquered the previously unclimbed West Face of Siula Grande in the Huayhuash mountain range in the Peruvian Andes in 1985. He and Joe Simpson completed the difficult climb, at times enduring extreme weather conditions. They subsequently survived a dramatic series of events on the descent. Simpson recounted the story in the book &quot;Touching the Void&quot;, which was later adapted into a film.

==Career==

Together with Simpson, Yates climbed Siula Grande (6,344 metres/20,814 ft) in 1985, via the hitherto unconquered West Face. The climb was difficult and was accomplished in, at times, challenging blizzard weather conditions. The climbers commenced their descent via the peak&#x27;s North Ridge which proved to be more difficult than they had anticipated. Shortly after the pair left the summit Yates fell through a cornice and started plummeting down the face they had just climbed but his fall was arrested by their climbing ropes. After a bivouac high on the peak, the pair continued their descent the following morning but then Simpson fell from an ice cliff on the North Ridge of the mountain, breaking his right leg and heel. To continue the descent, Yates then used their two ropes tied together (total length ) to lower Simpson down the mountain in stages in deteriorating weather conditions. Yates lowered Simpson by this method and felt they were regaining control of the situation despite a worsening storm. 

However, although the pair had almost descended to the relative safety of the glacier, Simpson went over an unseen cliff edge as he was being lowered, which meant that he was hanging free with only Yates&#x27;s hold on the rope to prevent him falling. Simpson was unable to get his weight off the rope and Yates could not lower him any further. The two climbers were stuck in this situation for a considerable time (Yates estimated in excess of an hour and a half) during which time the weight of Simpson on the rope was pulling Yates from his unbelayed stance, above Simpson and an unknown additional distance above the glacier. To avoid being pulled off the mountain to almost certain death, Yates cut the rope. Simpson fell approximately to the entrance to a crevasse and a further distance onto a ledge within the crevasse. Yates dug a snowhole in the slope behind his stance and spent the rest of the night there. The following morning Yates completed his descent to the glacier and being unable to find Simpson he concluded his companion must have been killed, he returned to base camp that day. However, Simpson survived the fall and managed to climb and crawl out of the crevasse and reached base camp four days later.

Yates&#x27; rescue efforts contributed significantly to saving Simpson&#x27;s life despite his decision, near the end of rescue, that he needed to cut their climbing rope to prevent a fatal fall. Yates&#x27; initially received some criticism for cutting the rope from some not in possession of the full facts relating to his rescue of Simpson. Simpson has always vehemently defended Yates&#x27; actions, saying he would have done it himself had the roles been reversed and that his initial motivation for writing &quot;Touching the Void&quot; was to set out the full circumstances in response to ill-informed criticism of Yates.

Yates commented that after he moved away from Sheffield he had &#x27;hardly seen Joe (Simpson) for nine years&#x27; until they went to Peru to film some scenes for the &quot;Touching the Void&quot; documentary. 

Immediately after return from the Siula Grande climb, Yates went to the European Alps and climbed the North Face of the Eiger partnered by John Silvester. Subsequently he has participated in many expeditions including those that made the first ascents of Laila Peak and Nemeka in Pakistan and several expeditions to the Cordillera Darwin in Chile. In 2007 Yates acted a guide to two Icelandic climbers in a successful attempt to climb Ama Dablam (6,812 metres/22,349 ft) in the Khumbu region of Nepal to the south of the Mount Everest massif and a film of the expedition was made: &quot;Ama Dablam: Beyond the Void&quot;. In July 2009, Yates successfully led a group of four clients to the summit of Lenin Peak (7134 m). In September 2010, Yates planned to return to the Cordillera Huayhuash 25 years after his climb with Simpson, to lead a group of trekkers to the base camp of Siula Grande and to the viewpoint over Cerro Bella Vista, from where the path along which Simpson crawled to safety can be seen.

Yates has authored three autobiographical books about mountaineering. The first, &quot;Against the Wall&quot;, is about an expedition to climb a new route on the Central Torres del Paine in Chilean Patagonia and was short-listed for the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature. The book details how that particular climb led to Yates re-evaluating the priorities in his life as a climber. &quot;The Flame of Adventure&quot; describes a series of climbing expeditions around the world. His most recent book, &quot;The Wild Within&quot;, describes expeditions to the Cordillera Darwin in Tierra del Fuego, the Wrangell St-Elias ranges on the Alaska-Yukon border, and eastern Greenland.

==Personal life==
Yates was born in Croft, Leicestershire, England and educated at Lutterworth Grammar School. In the 1980s he moved to Sheffield to complete a degree in biochemistry at the University of Sheffield. After graduation Yates concentrated on mountaineering and did rope access work to support himself financially.

Yates currently lives in Cumbria (north west England) with his wife Jane Yates and their two children Lewis and Maisy Yates. Yates&#x27; wife and children have accompanied him on some of his later expeditions.

<doc id="546131" wikidata="Q1097036" url="?curid=546131" title="Ineni">
<text>Ineni (sometimes transliterated as Anena) was an ancient Egyptian architect and government official of the 18th Dynasty, responsible for major construction projects under the pharaohs Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II and the joint reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. He had many titles, including Superintendent of the Granaries, Superintendent of the Royal Buildings, Superintendent of the Workmen in the Karnak Treasuries, etc.

Ineni came from an aristocratic family and likely began his career as an architect under Amenhotep I. Amenhotep I commissioned Ineni to expand the Temple of Karnak. The expansion included a barque shrine of Amun and a new treasury. Ineni probably also oversaw the construction of Amenhotep I&#x27;s tomb and mortuary temple. The mortuary temple was the first to be disconnected from the actual tomb, presumably so it would not draw attention to the burial site. Amenhotep I died before the treasury could be completed, but Ineni was retained by his successor, Thutmose I.

An avid builder, Thutmose I commissioned many construction projects during his rule, including the first tomb carved out at the Valley of the Kings. Many of his projects were at the Temple of Karnak and were under the supervision of Ineni. These works included the fourth and fifth pylons, numerous courts and statues, the completion of the Treasury expansion begun by Amenhotep I, and a hypostyle hall of cedar wood constructed at Karnak to commemorate Thutmose I&#x27;s victory over the Hyksos.

After the death of Thutmose I, Ineni was once again retained by the royal family. During the reign of Hatshepsut, a new architect, Senemut, would gain major commissions; most notably the construction of her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. Ineni, however, continued to supervise several structures commissioned by Hatshepsut and was likely consulted on many others. He was considered by his contemporaries to be one of her court favorites, and the steles on the walls of his tomb speak kindly of her. He died during the reign of Hatshepsut before Thutmose III assumed the throne in Hatshepsut&#x27;s 22nd regnal year. His tomb was one of the few structures where Hatshepsut&#x27;s name was not chiseled out or replaced, perhaps out of respect for him.

<doc id="546132" wikidata="Q5333955" url="?curid=546132" title="The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa">
<text>The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa is a Czech alternative rock band formed in 1990 by Jan Muchow, Jan Gregar, Petr Wegner, and Irna Libowitz.

The band released the EP &quot;Pigment&quot; in 1991. This album, along with 1992&#x27;s &quot;Susurrate&quot;, featured a feedback-drenched psychedelic rock sound.

From there, the band moved into ambient and techno-influenced soundscapes, as evidenced by their 1993 album, &quot;Free-D&quot;, produced with Guy Fixsen (Laika). &quot;Free-D&quot; marked the end of the original lineup and something of a hiatus for the band. For the next six years, they only released the 1994 remix EP &quot;AstralaVista&quot;.

1999&#x27;s &quot;In Dust 3&quot; featured Muchow and actress Kateřina Winterová on eleven tracks of pop and post rock sounds. This was followed in 2003 by &quot;Slowthinking&quot;, released with the accompanying &quot;Fastmoving/Slowthinking&quot; DVD.

The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa released &quot;Watching Black&quot; in 2006, and in 2011, a DVD titled &quot;101010&quot; came out, featuring a live performance recorded on 10 October 2010.

<doc id="546133" wikidata="Q310797" url="?curid=546133" title="Lilium mackliniae">
<text>Lilium mackliniae, the [[Shirui]] lily or Shirui Kashong Timrawon, is a rare Indian species of plant found only in the upper reaches of the Shirui hill ranges in the Ukhrul district of Manipur, India, at an elevation of above sea level. It is located near the boundary of Myanmar to the east, Shirui village in the west, Choithar village in the south and Sihai village in the north.

This shade-loving lily has pale bluish-pink petals but has seven colours when observed through a microscope. In the wild, it flowers in the monsoon months of June and July. They are seasonal flowering plants and at their best in May and June when it blooms. The peak season of its bloom is May 15 to June 5. The height of the plant is and has one to seven flowers per plant.

==Description==
===Flower===
They blossom in Spring specifically May 15 - June 5. The plants are .3-.91m (1–3 ft) in height with 1-7 flowers per plant. It has pale blue-pink petals, but when observed through a microscope has seven colors. They are ivory on the inside and occasionally are colored a pale pink as well. The outside can be a reddish-purple as well. It is a trumpet-shaped flower which hangs downward.

==Cultivation==
The flowers can be cultivated in various ways. They grow well in humus soil that remains moist and is sheltered from direct summer sunlight. They can be grown as bulbs and seeds.

The seeds need to be covered with compost about 5 mm deep and need to be in a cool, but well-lit space. Artificial heat can prevent germination and they only germinate in the spring after they have been chilled or frozen in the winter. They can be grown in small pots and then repotted or planted outside. This is because the area in which they are from, Ukhrul, has wet summers and cold, dry winters.

==Use==
The lily has medicinal properties which is used in treating skin and stomach problems.

==History==
===Mythical origin===
It was believed that the plant can only be grown on the tops of the Shirui Hill as the British attempted to move it, but it wasn&#x27;t working. Also, the Ukhrul Village believe that a princess lived on the hill with her lover Shirui and after she died, she still waits for him and the flower comes from the soil she is buried from. Another legend is that the daughter of goddess Philava named Lily protects these hills. The third story is that the two lovers jumped from the cliffs to their death and thus came the flower. The flower is called Kashong Timrawon traditionally and is believed to represent kindness, protection, prosperity, and a happy life.

===Identification by Westerners===
The first Westerners to identify the flower were Jean and Frank Kingdon-Ward, who came to Manipur for botanical research in 1946. They set up base at Ukhrul in a building which they called &quot;Cobweb cottage alias Bug bungalow&quot;. The couple &quot;discovered&quot; the Siroi lily in 1946 and Frank later named it in honour of his wife. The discovery received the Prestigious Merit Prize in 1948 by Royal Horticultural Society Flower.

The India Post commemorated the Lily with issuing a postage stamp. It is also the State flower of Manipur.

===Conservation efforts===
Intense tourism, waste and plastic dumping, plucking, and uprooting of the plant has resulted in it becoming endangered. It has also been invaded by the bamboo invasive species. As such there have been multiple efforts made in order to help revitalize the flower. First in 1982, The Siroi National Park was established and covered an area of .41 km2 of where the lily naturally grows.

On 13 October 2013, Shajin Jinks, the head of the Department of Environment and Heritage of Goa, led an expedition to the Shiroi Hills to raise awareness to protect this endangered heritage. The Shirui Lily Festival has been started in May 2017, for the first time in history, to increase awareness of the rare flower and its value to the world. The festival is going to be celebrated every year in Ukhrul town as well as Shirui village in Manipur.

On Feb 19, 2015, the National Institute of Bio-resources and Sustainable Development launched a campaign to redevelop the habitat of the Siroi Lily. They will grow the flowers in the lab and distribute them to nurseries elsewhere to be planted and cultivated.

<text>The Junge Union Deutschlands (English: Young Union of Germany) or JU is the joint
youth organisation of the CDU/CSU coalition in Germany. Membership is limited to individuals between 14 and 35 years of age.

The Junge Union claims to be the largest political youth organization in Germany and Europe with about 100,000 members.

== Political positions ==
The JU views itself as an organization that aims to further the goals of its parent political parties, CDU/CSU, among the German youth, and to represent the interests of the younger generation within the CDU/CSU parties. In its platform, it defines itself as a liberal, conservative, yet progressive organization. The JU is committed to democracy and a social market economy. It supports European integration and a strong partnership with the United States within the framework of NATO. Within its parent parties, the Junge Union advocates political reform. One central objective is a remodeling of the public social security system which is confronted by an increasing dependency ratio.
The JU supports intergenerational equity in the areas of pension and health care system reforms, proposing to complement these systems with capital-based private accounts in order to address fiscal problems such as Germany&#x27;s debt-to-GDP ratio. The JU views labor-market liberalization as an effective means to battle unemployment. It favors university tuition fees, and has expressed support for the Center Against Expulsions in Berlin.

In foreign policy, the JU is committed to a German-American security alliance, and called for Germany to participate in the War against Iraq. It opposes Turkey&#x27;s full membership in the European Union, preferring for them to have a privileged partnership with the EU.

<text>Mohd. Ahmad Khan v. Shah Bano Begum [1985], commonly referred to as the Shah Bano case, was a controversial maintenance lawsuit in India, in which the Supreme Court delivered a judgment favouring maintenance given to an aggrieved divorced Muslim woman. Then the Congress government enacted a law with its most controversial aspect being the right to maintenance for the period of &quot;iddat&quot; after the divorce, and shifting the onus of maintaining her to her relatives or the Waqf Board. It was seen as discriminatory as it denied right to basic maintenance available to Muslim women under secular law.

Shah Bano Begum, from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, was divorced by her husband in 1978. She filed a criminal suit in the Supreme Court of India, in which she won the right to alimony from her husband. However, some Muslim politicians mounted a campaign for the verdict&#x27;s nullification. The judgement in favour of the woman in this case evoked criticisms among Muslims, some of whom cited the Qur&#x27;an to show that the judgement was in conflict with Islamic law. It triggered controversy about the extent of having different civil codes for different religions in India.

The case caused the Congress government, with its absolute majority, to pass the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, which diluted the judgment of the Supreme Court and restricted the right of Muslim divorcées to alimony from their former husbands for only 90 days after the divorce (the period of &quot;iddah&quot; in Islamic law). However, in later judgements including the &quot;Danial Latifi v. Union of India&quot; case and &quot;Shamima Farooqui v. Shahid Khan&quot;, the Supreme Court of India interpreted the act in a manner reassuring the validity of the case and consequently upheld the Shah Bano judgement, and The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 was nullified. Some Muslims, including the All India Shia Personal Law Board, supported the Supreme Court&#x27;s order to make the right to maintenance of a divorced Muslim wife absolute.

==Background==
In 1932, Shah Bano, a Muslim woman, was married to Mohammed Ahmad Khan, an affluent and well-known advocate in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, and had five children from the marriage. After 14 years, Khan took a younger woman as his second wife. Then after years of living with both wives, he divorced Shah Bano when she was 62 years old. In April 1978, when Khan stopped giving her the 200 per month he had apparently promised, claiming that she had no means to support herself and her children, she filed a criminal suit at a local court in Indore, against her husband under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, asking him for a maintenance amount of 500 for herself and her children. In November 1978 her husband gave an irrevocable talaq (divorce) to her which was his prerogative under Islamic law and took up the defence that hence Bano had ceased to be his wife and therefore he was under no obligation to provide maintenance for her as except prescribed under the Islamic law which was in total 5,400. In August 1979, the local court directed Khan to pay a sum of 25 per month to Bano by way of maintenance. On 1 July 1980, on a revisional application of Bano, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh enhanced the amount of maintenance to 179.20 per month. Khan then filed a petition to appeal before the Supreme Court claiming that Shah Bano is not his responsibility anymore because Mr. Khan had a second marriage which is also permitted under Islamic Law.

===Opinion of Supreme Court===
On 3 February 1981, the two judge bench composed of Justice Murtaza Fazal Ali and A. Varadarajan who first heard the matter, in light of the earlier decisions of the court which had held that section 125 of the Code applies to Muslims also, referred Khan&#x27;s appeal to a larger Bench. Muslim bodies All India Muslim Personal Law Board and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind joined the case as intervenor. The matter was then heard by a five-judge bench composed of Chief Justice Chandrachud, Rangnath Misra, D. A. Desai, O. Chinnappa Reddy, and E. S. Venkataramiah. On 23 April 1985, Supreme Court in a unanimous decision, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the judgment of the High Court.

Supreme Court concluded that &quot;there is no conflict between the provisions of section 125 and those of the Muslim Personal Law on the question of the Muslim husband&#x27;s obligation to provide maintenance for a divorced wife who is unable to maintain herself.&quot; After referring to the Quran, holding it to the greatest authority on the subject, it held that there was no doubt that the Quran imposes an obligation on the Muslim husband to make provision for or to provide maintenance to the divorced wife. Shah Bano approached the courts for securing maintenance from her husband. When the case reached the Supreme Court of India, seven years had elapsed. The Supreme Court invoked Section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure, which applies to everyone regardless of caste, creed, or religion. It ruled that Shah Bano be given maintenance money, similar to alimony.

The Court also regretted that article 44 of the Constitution of India in relation to bringing of Uniform Civil Code in India remained a dead letter and held that a common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies.

==Movement against the judgment==
The &quot;Shah Bano&quot; judgment, as claimed, became the centre of raging controversy, with the press turning it into a major national issue. The Shah Bano judgment elicited a protest from many sections of Muslims who also took to the streets against what they believed as an attack on their religion and their right to their own religious personal laws.
Some Muslims felt threatened by what they perceived as an encroachment on the Muslim Personal Law, and protested loudly at the judgment. The spokesmen for some were the Barelvi leader Obaidullah Khan Azmi and Syed Kazi. At the forefront was All India Muslim Personal Law Board, an organization formed in 1973 devoted to upholding what they saw as Sharia (Muslim Personal Law).

== Dilution of the effect of the judgment ==

In the 1984 Indian general election, Indian National Congress had won absolute majority in the parliament. After the &quot;Shah Bano&quot; judgment, many leaders in the Indian National Congress suggested to the Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi that if the government did not enact a law in Parliament overturning the Supreme Court judgement, the Congress would face decimation in the polls ahead.

In 1986, the Parliament of India passed an act titled The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, that nullified the Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment in the &quot;Shah Bano&quot; judgment. Diluting the Supreme Court judgment, the act allowed maintenance to a divorced woman only during the period of iddat, or till 90 days after the divorce, according to the provisions of Islamic law. This was in stark contrast to Section 125 of the Code. The &#x27;liability&#x27; of husband to pay the maintenance was thus restricted to the period of the iddat only.&quot;

The &quot;Statement of Objects and Reasons&quot; of the act stated that &quot;the Shah Bano decision had led to some controversy as to the obligation of the Muslim husband to pay maintenance to the divorced wife and hence opportunity was therefore taken to specify the rights which a Muslim divorced woman is entitled to at the time of divorce and to protect her interests.&quot;

===Reactions to the act===
The law received severe criticism from several sections of the society. The Opposition called it another act of &quot;appeasement&quot; towards the minority community by the Indian National Congress. The All India Democratic Women&#x27;s Association (AIDWA) organised demonstrations of Muslim women against the move to deprive them of rights that they had hitherto shared with the Hindus.

The Bharatiya Janata Party regarded it as an &#x27;appeasement&#x27; of the Muslim community and discriminatory to non-Muslim men and saw it as a &quot;violation of the sanctity of the country&#x27;s highest court&quot;. The &#x27;Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act&#x27; was seen as discriminatory as it denied divorced Muslim women the right to basic maintenance which women of other faiths had access to under secular law. Makarand Paranjape sees the overruling of Supreme Court verdict in &quot;Shah Bano case&quot; which happened when the Congress party was in power, as one of the examples of the party&#x27;s pseudo-secular tactics which allowed &quot;cynical manipulation of religion for political ends&quot;. Lawyer and former law minister of India, Ram Jethmalani has termed the act as &quot;retrogressive obscurantism for short-term minority populism&quot;. Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s colleague Arif Mohammad Khan who was INC member and a minister in Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet resigned from the post and party in protest.

Critics of the Act point out that while divorce is within the purview of personal laws, maintenance is not, and thus it is discriminatory to exclude Muslim women from a civil law. Exclusion of non-Muslim men from a law that appears inherently beneficial to men is also pointed out by them. Hindu nationalists have repeatedly contended that a separate Muslim code is tantamount to preferential treatment and demanded a uniform civil code.

==Later developments==
The Act has led to Muslim women receiving a large, one-time payment from their husbands during the period of &quot;iddat&quot;, instead of a maximum monthly payment of 500 – an upper limit which has since been removed. Cases of women getting lump sum payments for lifetime maintenance are becoming common. However it is seen that despite its unique feature of no ceiling on quantum of maintenance, the Act is sparingly used because of the lack of its knowledge even among lawyers. The legal fraternity generally uses the CrPC provision while moving maintenance petitions, considering it handy.

The Shah Bano case had once again spurred the debate on the Uniform Civil Code in India. The Hindu Right led by parties like the Jan Sangh in its metamorphosis as the Bharatiya Janata Party, became an advocate for secular laws across the board. However, their opposition to the reforms was based on the argument that no similar provisions would be applied for the Muslims on the claim that they weren&#x27;t sufficiently advanced. The pressure exerted by orthodox Muslims caused women&#x27;s organizations and secularists to cave in.

This case had long term implications. The case became a milestone in Muslim women&#x27;s fight for equal rights in matters of marriage and divorce in regular courts.

== Challenge to the validity of the Act ==
The constitutional validity of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 was challenged before the Supreme Court in &quot;Danial Latifi &amp; Anr v. Union Of India&quot; by Daniel Latifi in 2001, who was the lawyer of Shah Bano in the Shah Bano case. The Supreme Court tried to maintain a balancing act, attempting to uphold Muslim women&#x27;s rights without addressing the constitutionality of gender and religious discrimination in personal law. Court reiterated the validity of the Shah Bano judgment. The Muslim Personal Law Board, an intervenor, questioned the authority of the court to interpret religious texts.

The Court concluded that the Act does not, in fact, preclude maintenance for divorced Muslim women, and that Muslim men must pay spousal support until such time as the divorced wife remarries. However the Court held that if the Act accorded Muslim divorcees unequal rights to spousal support compared with the provisions of the secular law under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, then the law would in fact, be unconstitutional. Further the Supreme Court construed the statutory provision in such a manner that it does not fall foul of articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. The provision in question is Section 3(1)(a) of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 which states that &quot;a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance to be made and paid to her within the iddat period by her former husband&quot;. The Court held this provision means that reasonable and fair provision and maintenance is not limited for the iddat period (as evidenced by the use of word &quot;within&quot; and not &quot;for&quot;). It extends for the entire life of the divorced wife until she remarries.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London. Its members are professional hackney carriage drivers, including London black taxicab drivers who have learnt the knowledge of London.

The Fellowship of Hackney Carriage Drivers was recognised by the City of London Corporation in 1990 and was granted livery in February 2004, becoming the Worshipful Company. The process started with an instruction from Oliver Cromwell to the City&#x27;s Court of Aldermen in 1654 on regulating drivers. Legislation created the Fellowship of Master Hackney Coachmen, the first such society for taxi drivers.

The company&#x27;s charity supports any deserving members and their immediate family. It has run an annual taxi tour to Disneyland Paris for children with life-threatening illnesses each year since 1994. Its education programme, The Cab Guide Course, teaches taxi drivers about the history of London in order to proceed to conduct London tours, and it seeks to promote public awareness about the high standards of the hackney carriage trade. The company also takes part in the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show.

The Hackney Carriage Drivers&#x27; Company ranks 104th in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies.

<doc id="546145" wikidata="Q1808364" url="?curid=546145" title="Triumph Dolomite">
<text>The Triumph Dolomite was a small saloon car produced by the Triumph Motor Company division of the British Leyland (BL) in Canley, Coventry, between October 1972 and August 1980.

== Background ==
The Dolomite was the final addition to Triumph&#x27;s small-car range (codenamed &quot;Project Ajax&quot;), which had started in 1965 with the Triumph 1300. Designed to be a replacement for the rear-wheel drive Triumph Herald,
the 1300 was originally fitted with a engine and front-wheel drive. The later model, introduced in September 1970 as the Triumph 1500, featured a remodelled front and rear, styled by Michelotti, and a larger engine.

Triumph were however dissatisfied with the market performance of the 1300; although it had been moderately successful, the higher price and greater complexity meant sales never reached the levels of the simpler and cheaper Herald which preceded it. In an attempt to improve matters, the car was comprehensively reengineered. Launched in September 1970, the Triumph Toledo was a cheaper and more basic variant of the 1300, but with conventional rear-wheel drive. This new model was assembled alongside the now larger-engined front-wheel drive version (the Triumph 1500) which was launched at the same time as the Toledo.

== Design and reception ==
The Triumph Dolomite was unveiled at the London Motor Show in October 1971 as the successor for the upmarket variants of front-wheel drive designs, and to replace the six-cylinder Triumph Vitesse, a sporting relative of the Herald. Due to a number of strikes and other industrial upsets, the car was not reported to be in full production until October 1972. The name &quot;Dolomite&quot; had been used by Triumph for a range of models prior to the Second World War and this was revived for the new car. The Dolomite used the longer bodyshell of the front wheel drive Triumph 1500, but with the majority of the running gear carried over from the rear-wheel drive Triumph Toledo.

Initially, the only version available used the new slant-four 1,854 cc engine, which mated an alloy overhead cam (OHC) head to an iron block, providing which offered sprightly performance. This was a version of the engine that the company was already providing to Saab for use in their 99 model.

The car was aimed at the new compact performance-luxury sector, vying for sales against cars such as the BMW 2002 and Ford Cortina GXL, and was offered with a high level of standard equipment, including twin headlamps, a clock, full instrumentation, luxury seats and carpets, a heated rear window, and a cigar lighter. Styling was similar to the Triumph 1500, with some updates such as a black painted rear panel, vinyl D-posts, and new wheel trims. The car was capable of , with coming up in just over 11 seconds. An overdrive gearbox was soon made available as an option and there was also an optional automatic transmission.
==Dolomite Sprint==

Although the Dolomite proved to be refined and rapid, competitors such as the BMW 2002 had a performance advantage which was costing Triumph both sales and prestige. To remedy this, Triumph unveiled the Dolomite Sprint in June 1973, although the launch had been delayed by a year; it had been due to go on sale in 1972.

&quot;A higher-powered development of the slant-four would provide the perfect engine to compete more effectively in motor sport. In response to this brief, Spen King’s team devised a plan to extract more power. With co-operation from Harry Mundy and the Engineers at Coventry Climax, a 16-valve cylinder head was designed&quot;, with all of the valves being actuated using a single camshaft rather than the more conventional DOHC arrangement. The capacity was also increased to , and combined with bigger carburettors the output was upped to at 4,500 rpm and at 5,700 rpm. This represented a significant power increase over the smaller 1850 cc variant.

The engine was expected to make 135bhp, and factory test engines were producing 150bhp. Hence, it was initially intended to be named the &#x27;Dolomite 135&#x27;. This was changed to &#x27;Dolomite Sprint&#x27; and published reasons vary. One oft-repeated rumour is that production lines could not guarantee 135bhp. However according to Matthew Vale, it was during development that Triumph switched to measuring power from imperial(SAE) to metric(DIN), which calculated outputs approximately 5 per cent lower. In this case 135bhp SAE is 127bhp DIN.

As a result of the use of this engine, the Dolomite Sprint has been claimed to be &quot;the world&#x27;s first mass-produced multi-valve car&quot;. While other multi-valve engines (notably the Lotus 907) were produced in volume, they were not used in mass production vehicles until after the introduction of the Dolomite Sprint. The design of the cylinder head won a British Design Council award in 1974.
0–60 mph acceleration took around 8.4 seconds, with a maximum speed of 119 mph (192 km/h). Trim was similar to the 1850, with the addition of standard alloy wheels (another first for a British production car), a vinyl roof, front spoiler, twin exhausts and lowered suspension. The seats were now cloth on the 1850, and these were also fitted to the Sprint.

Due to the increase in power brought by the new engine, the rest of the driveline was upgraded to be able to withstand the extra torque. The gearbox and differential were replaced by a version of those fitted to the TR and 2000 series cars, albeit with a close ratio gearset in the gearbox. The brakes were upgraded with new pad materials at the front, and the fitment of larger drums and a load-sensing valve at the rear. Other changes over the standard Dolomite included the option of a limited slip differential. The optional overdrive and automatic transmissions from the 1850 model were also offered as options on the Sprint. Initial models were only offered in &quot;mimosa yellow&quot;, although further colours were available from 1974 on.

At its launch, the Sprint was priced at £1,740, which compared extremely well to similar cars from other manufacturers. The press gave the Dolomite Sprint an enthusiastic reception. &quot;Motor&quot; summarised its road test (subtitled &quot;Britain leads the way&quot;) with glowing praise:
A press release dated May 1973, from BL&#x27;s public relations department, states &quot;To acknowledge the Dolomite Sprint&#x27;s performance the Triumph sports car colour range will be used, with the first 2,000 cars finished in Mimosa with black trim. Other distinguishing features are a black simulated leather roof covering, contrasting coachlines along the body and new badges.&quot;

From May 1975 on, overdrive on third and fourth gear (giving the Sprint a six-speed gearbox) and tinted glass were fitted as standard. In addition, all Sprints were fitted with body side trims, a plastic surround for the gearlever, and a driver&#x27;s door mirror. Headrests were now available as an optional extra. From March 1976 headrests, a radio, and laminated windscreen were standard. In 1979, to comply with upcoming UK legislation, a rear fog lamp was also standard.

As with many other British Leyland cars of the period, a number of &quot;special tuning&quot; options were available for the Dolomite Sprint, offering dealer fitted upgrades to the car that included larger carburettors, freer flowing exhaust systems, and competition camshafts. These upgrades were designed by the factory race team and offered in order to homologate the tuning parts for competition purposes.

In 1977, a number (probably 62) of Triumph TR7s with the same Sprint engine were manufactured as pre-production cars at Speke, Liverpool. However, this Triumph TR7 Sprint variant was cancelled with the closure of the Speke assembly plant in 1978.

===Australian Sprints===
From August 1975 to June 1976, 620 Sprints were exported to Australia, all in Mimosa Yellow. The Triumph TR6 and Stag could be specified in Mimosa but not other Dolomites. The 16v Sprint generated a profile far higher than outright sales would suggest. In addition to stunning performance, the $7700 road going Sprints were praised for full instrumentation, a walnut interior, clock, and corded bri-nylon upholstery as seen on the Porsche 911. Like the UK, the aforementioned &#x27;special tuning&#x27; options were also available as dealer fitted options. Australian market Sprints cost more new than the high performance Ford XB Falcon GT 351 which had an asking price of $7100. Other rivals included the Lancia Beta ($8233) and BMW 2002 ($8419). Influential Australian journalist Harold Dvoretsky (who in Europe, drove 1260 km in a Sprint) hailed the Sprint as British Leyland&#x27;s best and most advanced model since the Jaguar XJ12. 

Sprints were raced throughout Australia including by dealers such as Ron Hodgson. As described by Mark Oastler, Hodgson invested six figure amounts developing the Sprint into a unique competition car which was to be amongst the fastest of its type anywhere in the world. Inspired by L34 Torana program and dubbed &#x27;Super Sprint&#x27; this was ultimately rejected by the Confederation of Australian Motorsport(CAMS). CAMS also insisted on 500 cars for homologation requirements whilst Leyland were willing to build only 300 (from the 600 already present in Australia). 

At the 1976 Bathurst 1000, Jack Brabham&#x27;s Torana was famously rammed and heavily damaged by a Dolomite Sprint driven by John Dellaca and Kerry Wade.
In the following year, CAMS controversially refused to approve the Sprint&#x27;s pistons, thereby denying the Sprint compliance to race in the 1977 Hardie-Ferodo Bathurst 1000. 

By July 1976 the strict Australian Design Rule ADR27A came into effect. With emission requirements unique to Australia it was not feasible for British Leyland to reengineer the car for a small niche market. Of the 620 Dolomite Sprints imported into Australia, it is believed fewer than 80 examples (in varying condition) have survived. They are considered collectible today. 

==Rationalisation==

By the mid-1970s, the range had become complex, with a large number of models and specifications. The Dolomite bodyshell was still being made as the basic Toledo (short boot bodyshell, OHV, rear-wheel drive), the 1500 TC (standard bodyshell, OHV, rear-wheel drive) and the Dolomite/Dolomite Sprint (Standard bodyshell, / , OHC, rear-wheel drive).

In 1976, with the manufacturer effectively nationalised and following recommendations in the government commissioned Ryder Report, the Dolomite and other similarly bodied ranges were rationalised as follows:

*Dolomite 1300: Base model, basic trim, single headlamps, 1,296 cc engine
*Dolomite 1500: Same as the 1300, with engine
*Dolomite 1500HL: Luxury specification as per the 1850, with 1,493 cc engine
*Dolomite 1850HL: Luxury specification, OHC engine (front spoiler fitted from 1975)
*Dolomite Sprint: The performance version: luxury trim, 16-valve engine

The Dolomite 1300 used the Standard SC engine from the Herald and Spitfire, and replaced the Toledo as the basic model in the range. The body was identical except for the lengthened body which gave the larger boot of the original Dolomites. The 1300 retained simplified fittings, including single, square, headlamps, basic instrumentation and seats, with the wooden dashboard and carpeting of the Toledo. There was no two-door option as there had been for the Toledo, and the shorter-boot bodyshell of the Toledo ceased production. Standard equipment included reclining front seats, cigar lighter, &quot;fasten seat belt&quot; warning light, driver&#x27;s door mirror, twin reversing lights and a dipping rear-view mirror. The dashboard design was the same as that fitted to the facelifted Toledo of 1975. There was no overdrive or automatic transmission option with the 1300.

The next model up, replacing the Triumph 1500 TC, was the Dolomite 1500. The Dolomite 1500 offered identical specifications to the Dolomite 1300, apart from the seats, but with a engine and twin carburettors. Overdrive and automatic transmissions were offered as optional extras.

The 1500HL had essentially identical specification to the luxury 1850 (now designated 1850HL), but again featured the 1,493 cc engine. Performance was good, and once again overdrive and automatic transmissions were optional. The HL model had an improved specification level over the standard Dolomite 1500 including a rev counter, volt meter, separate fuel and temperature dials, clock, adjustable steering column and driver&#x27;s-seat height adjust, head rests, front seat rear pockets, rear centre arm rest and walnut door cappings on all four doors.

The new 1500 models replaced the previous front-wheel drive layout with rear-wheel drive, with few external differences apparent in the bodywork. At a time when most manufacturers of smaller cars were concentrating on front-wheel drive cars, this change was widely considered somewhat backward thinking. However, the otherwise completely rear-wheel drive model lineup at Triumph meant that switching to rear-wheel drive would afford significant cost savings. 

==Late 1970s==

The Dolomite changed very little (in all its variants) from the beginning to the very end, only minor trim differences and additional standard equipment being the main changes. 1979 saw the introduction of the Dolomite SE, of which 2,163 were built. The bodyshell was of the basic 1500 (single headlamps) but the interior was fitted with luxury trim including burr walnut dashboard and door cappings (the dashboard was the same style as fitted to that of the Dolomite 1300), grey velour seats and matching carpet. All the cars were painted black with wide silver stripes running full length, with the letters &quot;SE&quot; at the end of the rear wing. The SE also sported a front spoiler and Spitfire style road wheels. By the late 1970s the Dolomite was looking increasingly old fashioned against newer competition, though still popular. Designer Giovanni Michelotti delivered a promising new design (Sprint based) resembling a Fiat 132, with a squared front and BMW style &#x27;kink&#x27;. At least one full-size example was built. With severe problems at BLMC, management refused, there was simply not enough money. Production continued until August 1980 when BL closed the Canley Factory as part of a restructuring process which also resulted in the closure of the MG factory at Abingdon two months later.

The Dolomite was replaced a year later by the Triumph Acclaim, a four-door front-wheel drive family saloon produced in a joint venture with Honda. However, the Acclaim was not a sporty model, designed instead to compete with traditional family saloons, although it did manage strong sales on British market.

This kept the marque alive until 1984 when the Acclaim was replaced with the Rover 200 and the Triumph Motor Company passed into history.

==Reputation and popularity today==

The Dolomite gained a reputation for fragility. The introduction of the Dolomite came at a turbulent time for BL and Triumph in particular with many new model introductions, completely new architecture and alloy head/iron block construction of the OHC slant-four, meant that dealership mechanics were not fully aware of the servicing requirements of the engine. In particular, it required the cooling system to be kept in good condition, and partially filled with a rust inhibitor, otherwise corrosion leading to radiator blockages and overheating could occur. With a well-maintained example, ownership need not be an issue today. Amongst enthusiasts, the Dolomite and especially Sprint are still popular, with many parts still available and excellent club support.

The Dolomite became a fairly rare sight on British roads with only about 1300 roadworthy examples registered in the UK with 300-400 16 valve Sprints in 2009. This is favourable when compared to other contemporaries such as the Morris Marina, of which fewer than 800 examples out of 953,576 produced were still roadworthy, despite the Marina being a stronger seller than the Dolomite. They have a popular following throughout Europe and Australia, where Sprints were imported between 1975 and 1978, and raced at Amaroo Park and at the famous Bathurst 1000. A small number of Dolomites including the Sprint variation were also imported into New Zealand during the original production run.

==Motorsport==

===Touring cars===
The Dolomite Sprint was campaigned in the British Saloon Car Championship from 1974 to 1978.

The BSCC changed to an FIA Group-1 (series-production touring cars) competition from 1974 and the Dolomite Sprint was homologated into Group-1 on 2 Jan 1974. This required initial production of 5,000 cars in 12 months, which was exceeded, just, in 1973. Continued production was then needed to maintain Group-1 eligibility. For 1974, &quot;The series production is regarded as completely stopped if the monthly rate has decreased for more than four consecutive months to below 1/12th of the minimum figure required&quot;, i.e. it required more than 417 per month for 3 evenly spaced months in 12. But from 1975 (following FIA rule changes), it only required 500 a year. Nonetheless, it may be assumed that production capacity was determined on the initial requirement for 5000 in the first 12 months and at least 1250 a year (417 a month at 4 month intervals) thereafter.

It met with some success, with Andy Rouse winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1975, and also lifting the manufacturer&#x27;s title in 1974 with teammate Tony Dron.

The Sprint driven by Andy Rouse and Tony Dron placed fifth overall in the Spa 24 hours race in July 1974.
In September Dron placed 3rd place overall in a Sprint competing in the RAC Tourist Trophy race of that year.
In 1975 Andy Rouse won the British Saloon Car Championship outright by taking the driver&#x27;s title in a Sprint. In 1976 Broadspeed only ran one Dolomite Sprint in British Saloon Car Championship, with Rouse finishing second in the two-litre class. 1977 saw the departure of Rouse and the return of Tony Dron as driver of the Broadspeed prepared Dolomite Sprint. Dron won no less than seven of the twelve races outright against some stiff competition, and narrowly missed out on winning the championship outright because of tyre failure on the final race when leading his class by over a minute. In 1978 Broadspeed entered a sole Dolomite Sprint (driven by Tony Dron) where it won only one race outright, although the Sprint still won class B in the last year a factory entered Sprint would compete in the British Saloon Car Championship.

It appears that, at least from some point, the racing Dolomites Sprints used in the BSCC series were fitted with larger 2&quot; SU HS8 carburettors, instead of the 1.75&quot; HS6 carbs of the production cars. These are referred to as the &quot;group one and a half cars&quot;. 

The larger HS8s were also approved for FIA Group 1 from 1 Feb 1975. However, it is not clear how this approval could have been granted, given that FIA/CSI rules (Appendix J, 1975) for Group 1 denied any such modification to the carburation and thus required an additional 5000 cars to be produced in 12 months and fitted with any such modification affecting performance. Yet there is no evidence of any production of Dolomite Sprints fitted with HS8s. Neither is there any evidence of BL documentation supposed to mislead the FIA that 5000 cars fitted with HS8s and a higher lift cam, as an &#x27;emissions kit&#x27;, were exported to California. Also, this approval was removed from a later version of the FIA form of recognition for the Dolomite Sprint and was not transferred to FISA Group A approvals. There does not appear to be any current evidence of the use of HS8s on Group 1 or the &quot;group one and a half&quot; Dolomite Sprints outside the BSCC series. A similarly anomalous FIA approval for the Group 1 use of Weber 48DCOE carbs and suitable inlet manifold, dated 1 Jan 1977, was also removed later and not transferred to FISA Group A. The use of Weber equipped Dolomite Sprints in FIA Group 2 competitions (where choice of carburation was free) seems clear, but their use in Group 1 or &quot;group one and a half&quot; is not.

===Rallying===

Due to the heavier bodyshell and somewhat fragile Group-2 tuned engine,&quot;rated at 225 bhp at 8000 rpm&quot; by 1977, the Dolomite Sprint was less successful in rallying. Retirements were rather frequent resulting in failure to complete any rallies during 1974.

Things improved slightly in 1975 when a Sprint crewed by Brian Culcheth and Johnstone Syer finished 11th overall in the Welsh Rally in May 1975 (FRW 812L). This was quickly followed up with an impressive second place overall in the Tour of Britain in August 1975, and in the 1975 Lombard RAC Rally Culcheth and Syer won Group 1 and were first in class.

In January 1976 Tony Pond and D. Richards won Group 1 in the Tour of Dean Rally.
In the same month, Culcheth and Syer finished fifth overall in the Snowman Rally, and seventh overall in the Mintex Rally a month later, with Tony Pond and D. Richards coming first in Group 1. Culcheth and Syer had to retire in the Granite City Rally held in March, while Pond and Richards came home fourth overall and finished first in Group 1.
Culcheth and Syer finished second overall in the Tour of Britain and in the Manx Trophy Rally held in August, while P. Ryan and F. Gallagher came in ninth overall. P. Ryan and M. Nicholson also came first in Group N in the Lindisfarne Rally held in October, and they also came second in Group 1 in the Castrol &#x27;76.

From May 1976 onwards, the Dolomite Sprint would run alongside the TR7 before being eventually withdrawn from rallying, the TR7 V8 taking over the mantle. In the Lombard RAC Rally of 1976, the Sprint was forced to retire with engine problems. 1977 would be the last season where factory entered Sprints would compete in any form of rallying. Ryan and Nicholson managed to win Group 1 while coming eighth overall in the Granite City Rally, and this was followed by ninth overall in the Welsh Rally and finishing second in Group 1.

The Scottish Rally saw Ryan and Nicholson come 12th overall and helped win the team prize with two other TR7s. The Manx Rally held in September 1977 was the very last rally where a works-entered Sprint was entered, but it ended its rallying career on a high, managing seventh overall and first in Group 1 (both &quot;Class 1&quot; and &quot;Production&quot; classes) driven by Ryan and Nicholson.

Triumph Dolomites continue to be used in many forms of classic motorsport today, with cars being campaigned on track, hillclimbs, rally stages and autocrosses in the UK, mainland Europe, and Australia, as well as the USA.

==Dolomite-derived cars==

The early Robin Hood S7 used the front subframe and mechanical components from any Dolomite, attached to a monocoque body made out of stainless steel. Later Robin Hoods were Ford based. The Latham F2 used Dolomite mechanicals (usually Sprints), but attached to a fibreglass sports car body.

The Panther Rio was based on the Dolomite 1850 but was re-skinned with aluminium panels and had a completely revised interior. Also available was the Panther Rio Especiale, which used the Dolomite Sprint as a base. It was expensive, £9,445 for the Rio Especiale when, in February 1976, a Dolomite Sprint could be purchased for £3,283 and a V12 Jaguar XJ12 5.3 for £7,496. In total, 38 Rios were sold and were produced from 1975 to 1977.

<doc id="546158" wikidata="Q175844" url="?curid=546158" title="Emetophobia">
<text>Emetophobia is a phobia that causes overwhelming, intense anxiety pertaining to vomit. This specific phobia can also include subcategories of what causes the anxiety, including a fear of vomiting or being vomited on or seeing others vomit. Emetophobes might also avoid the mentions of &quot;barfing&quot;, vomiting, &quot;throwing up&quot;, or &quot;puking.&quot;

It is common for those who suffer from emetophobia to be underweight or malnourished due to strict diets and restrictions they make for themselves. The thought of someone possibly vomiting can cause the phobic person to engage in extreme behaviors to escape from their anxiety triggers, e.g. going to great lengths to avoid situations that could be perceived as &quot;threatening&quot;.

Emetophobia is clinically considered an &quot;elusive predicament&quot; because limited research has been done pertaining to it. The fear of vomiting receives little attention compared to other fears.

==Etymology ==
The root word for emetophobia is &quot;emesis&quot;, from the Greek word , which means &quot;an act or instance of vomiting&quot;, with &quot;-phobia&quot; meaning &quot;an exaggerated usually inexplicable fear of a particular object, class of objects, or situation.&quot;

==Overview==
The event of vomiting may make anyone with this particular phobia flee the scene. Some may fear other people throwing up, while others may fear themselves throwing up. Some may fear both. Some may have anxiety that makes them feel as if they will throw up when they actually might not. Other possible fears that may come with emetophobia is not being able to locate a restroom in a timely manner, not being able to stop throwing up, choking on vomit, being embarrassed due to the situation, or having to seek medical attention. People with emetophobia usually experience anxiety; they often may scream, cry, or if it is severe, pass out when someone or something has vomited.

===Causes===
People with emetophobia frequently report a vomit-related traumatic event, such as a long bout of stomach flu, accidentally vomiting in public or having to witness someone else vomit, as the start of the emetophobia. They may also be afraid of hearing that someone is feeling like vomiting or that someone has vomited or the mention of any word relating to the act of vomiting, usually in conjunction with the fears of seeing someone vomit or seeing vomit.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Emetophobics may also have other complicating disorders and phobias, such as social anxiety, fear of flying and agoraphobia. These three are very common, because people who fear vomiting are often terrified of doing so or encountering it in a public place. Therefore, they may restrict their social activities so they avoid any situations with alcohol or dining out in restaurants. Emetophobics may also limit exposure to children for fear of germs. People who have a fear of vomiting may avoid travel because of the worry about motion sickness or others experiencing it around them. They may also fear roller coasters for the same reason.

Lipsitz et al.&#x27;s findings also showed that those with emetophobia often have difficulties comfortably leading a normal life. Many find that they have problems being alone with young children, and they may also avoid social gatherings where alcohol is present. Retaining an occupation becomes difficult for emetophobics. Emetophobia can also affect a person&#x27;s social life. The phobia can cause people to miss out on everyday events or requirements. It is common for children to miss school, teens/adults to miss work, and for people to go great measures of not socializing with others. Professions and personal goals can be put on hold due to the high anxiety associated with the phobia, and travelling becomes almost impossible for some.

In Lipsitz et al.&#x27;s survey, women with emetophobia said that they either delayed pregnancy or avoided pregnancy altogether because of the morning sickness associated with the first trimester, and if they did become pregnant, it made pregnancy difficult.

Other inhibitions on daily life can be seen in meal preparation. Many emetophobic people also have specific &quot;rituals&quot; for the food they eat and how they prepare it. They frequently check the freshness of the food along with washing it several times in order to prevent any potential sicknesses that they could contract from foods not handled properly. They might overcook food products in fear of getting a foodborne illness Eating out may also be avoided and when asked Lipsitz et al.&#x27;s survey, many felt they were underweight because of the strict diets that they put upon themselves. In addition, many emetophobes avoid certain foods all together due to negative memories they may have with it relating to vomiting, and often eat a limited number of foods due to feeling like a vast majority of foods aren&#x27;t &#x27;safe&#x27;. Those who suffer from emetophobia might avoid anything that has an unpleasant smell or aroma, in fear of vomiting. This includes eating anything that might have a bad smell. They might also avoid any sight that may induce vomiting in them or other people.

====Emetophobia and anorexia====
There are some cases where anorexia is the result of a fear of vomiting instead of the typical psychological problems that trigger it. In Frank M. Datillio&#x27;s clinical case study, a situation where anorexia results from emetophobia is mentioned. Datillio says, &quot;...in one particular case report, atypical anorexia in several adolescent females occurred as a result of a fear of vomiting that followed a viral illness as opposed to the specific desire to lose weight or because of an anxiety reaction.&quot;. It is not clear that this should be termed &quot;anorexia&quot;, however. In cases such as this, many emetophobes may also have avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which is characterized by a general disinterest in food, sensory issues with food (taste, texture, look, smell) or a fear of adverse consequences from eating (vomiting or choking).

Oftentimes, this phobia is comorbid with several others, making it necessary to deal with each phobia individually in order for the patient to recover fully. For example, it is common for people with emetophobia to also have a fear of food, known as cibophobia, where they worry that the food they are eating is carrying pathogens that can cause vomiting. As such, people will develop specific behaviors that will, in their minds, make the food safe to eat, such as a ritualistic type of washing or the intentional overcooking of meat to avoid the intake of harmful pathogens. In time, these fears can become so ingrained that the person who has them can begin to experience anorexia nervosa. Again, it is not clear that this should be deemed &quot;anorexia&quot; rather than, for instance OCD, given this different presentation.

===Emetophobia and obsessive–compulsive disorder===

There are many cases of emetophobes that also suffer from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Both emetophobia and OCD have similar symptoms and behaviors according to Allen H. Weg, EdD. This includes: &quot;obsessional thinking, hyper-awareness and reactivity, avoidance, compulsive rituals, and safety behaviors&quot;. Emetophobia is often misdiagnosed as OCD.

==Causes and signs==
There is a strong agreement in the scientific community that there is no specific cause of emetophobia. Some emetophobics report a traumatic experience with vomiting, always in childhood. Some experts believe that emetophobia may be linked to worries about lack of control. Many people try to control themselves and their environment in every possible way, but vomiting is difficult or impossible to control which can lead to anxiety or in other cases severe anxiety.

There are many factors that can cause a legitimate case of emetophobia. Dr. Angela L. Davidson &quot;et al&quot;. conducted an experiment where it was concluded through various surveys that people with emetophobia are more likely to have an internal locus of control pertaining to their everyday life as well as health-related matters. A locus of control is an individual&#x27;s perception of where control comes from. Having an internal locus of control means that an individual perceives that they have their own control over a situation, whereas an external locus of control means that an individual perceives that some things are out of their control. She explains how this phobia is created through the locus of control by stating, &quot;Thus far, it seems reasonable to stipulate that individuals with a vomiting phobia deem events as being within their control and may therefore find it difficult to relinquish this control during the act of vomiting, thus inducing a phobia.&quot;

In an internet survey conducted by Dr. Joshua D. Lipsitz &quot;et al.&quot; given to emetophobic people, respondents gave many different reasons as to why they became emetophobic. Among some of the causes listed were several severe bouts of vomiting as children and being firsthand witnesses to many severe vomiting in others due to illness, pregnancy or alcoholism.

Some possible signs may include not consuming certain foods or alcohol, not being able to watch vomit scenes during movies or shows, avoiding people that are not feeling well, regularly washing hands, steering clear from traveling and crowds, making sure bathrooms are near, consistently checking signs of illness, avoiding certain smells, or pitching food before the expiration date.

== Treatments ==

===Assessment===
There are two assessment tools used to diagnose emetophobia: the Specific Phobia of Vomiting inventory and the Emetophobia Questionnaire. They are self-report questionnaires that focus on a different range of symptoms.

There have been a limited number of studies in regard to emetophobia. Victims of the phobia usually experience fear before vomiting but feel less afterwards. The fear comes back, however, if the victim fears they will throw up again.

===Medications===
Also noted in the emetophobia internet survey was information about medications. People were asked whether they would consider taking anxiety medication to potentially help their fear, and many in the study answered they wouldn&#x27;t for fear that the drugs would make them nauseated. Others, however, stated that some psychotropic medications (such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants) did help with their phobia, and some said gastrointestinal medications were also beneficial.

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy ===
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychological treatment that can be used to help calm anxiety. It is most commonly used to treat certain behaviors by changing people&#x27;s actions and thoughts by using a variety of different techniques to figure out why the fear is occurring. Speaking to a therapist can also be beneficial and develop possible coping mechanisms.

=== Exposure treatments ===
Exposure methods, using video-taped exposure to others vomiting, hypnosis, exposure to nausea and exposure to cues of vomiting, systemic behavior therapy, psychodynamic and psychotherapy have also shown positive effects for the treatment of emetophobia. However, in some cases it may cause re-traumatization, and the phobia may become more intense as a result.

<text>The University of Amsterdam (abbreviated as UvA, ) is a public research university located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Established in 1632 by municipal authorities, it is the fourth-oldest academic institution in the Netherlands still in operation.

The UvA is one of two large, publicly funded research universities in the city, the other being the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). It is also part of the largest research universities in Europe with 31,186 students, 4,794 staff, 1,340 PhD students and an annual budget of €600 million. It is the largest university in the Netherlands by enrollment. The main campus is located in central Amsterdam, with a few faculties located in adjacent boroughs. The university is organised into seven faculties: Humanities, Social and Behavioural Sciences, Economics and Business, Science, Law, Medicine, Dentistry.

Close ties are harbored with other institutions internationally through its membership in the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe (UNICA), European University Association (EUA) and Universitas 21. The University of Amsterdam has produced six Nobel Laureates and five prime ministers of the Netherlands.

== History ==
=== &quot;Athenaeum Illustre&quot; (1632–1877) ===
In January 1632, the &quot;Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam&quot; (Latin: Illustrious School of Amsterdam) was founded by the municipal authorities in Amsterdam. It was mainly devoted to medical teaching. The first two professors were Gerardus Vossius and Caspar Barlaeus. The &quot;Athenaeum Illustre&quot;
provided education comparable to other higher education institutions, although it could not confer doctoral degrees. After training at the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, students could complete their education at a university in another town.

At the time, Amsterdam also housed several other institutions of higher education, including the Collegium Chirugicum, which trained surgeons, and other institutions that provided theological courses for the Remonstrant and the Mennonite communities. Amsterdam&#x27;s large degree of religious freedom allowed for the establishment of these institutions. Students of the Colegium Chirugicum and the theological institutions regularly attended classes at the &quot;Athenaeum Illustre&quot;.

In 1815 it was given the statutory obligation “to disseminate taste, civilisation and learning&quot; and “to replace, at least in part, the institutes of higher education and an academic education for those young men whose circumstances unable them to fully spend the time necessary for an academic career at an institute of higher education.” The &quot;Athenaeum&quot; began offering classes for students attending non-academic professional training in pharmacy and surgery in 1800. The &quot;Athenaeum Illustre&quot; largely worked together with Amsterdam&#x27;s theological institutions such as the &quot;Evangelisch-Luthers Seminarium&quot; (evangelical-Lutheran) and the &quot;Klinische&quot; School (medical school), the successor to the &quot;Collegium Chirurgicum&quot;.

The &quot;Athenaeum&quot; remained a small institution until the 19th century, with no more than 250 students and eight professors. Alumni of the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; include Cornelis Petrus Tiele.

=== Municipal university (1877–1961) ===
In 1877, the &quot;Athenuem Illustre&quot; became the Municipal University of Amsterdam and received the right to confer doctoral degrees. This gave the university the same privileges as national universities while being funded by the city of Amsterdam. The professors and lecturers were appointed by the municipal council. This resulted in a staff that was in many ways more colorful than the staffs of national universities. During its time as a municipal university, the university flourished, in particular in the science department, which counted many Nobel prize winners: Tobias Asser, Christiaan Eijkman, Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff, Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Pieter Zeeman, and Frits Zernike.

The University of Amsterdam&#x27;s municipal status brought about the relatively early addition of the faculties of Economics and Social Sciences. After the World War II the dramatic rise in the cost of university education put a constraint on the university&#x27;s growth.

=== National university (1961–present) ===
In 1961, the national government made the university a national university, giving it its current name, the University of Amsterdam. Funding was now given by the national government instead of the city and the appointment of professors was transferred to the board of governors. The city of Amsterdam retained a limited influence until 1971, when the appointment was handed over to the executive board.

During May 1969, the university became the focus of nationwide news when UvA&#x27;s administrative centre at the &quot;Maagdenhuis&quot; was occupied by hundreds of students who wanted more democratic influence in educational and administrative matters. The protest lasted for days and was eventually broken up by the police. During the 1970s and 1980s, the university was often the target of nationwide student actions.

The university saw considerable expansion since becoming a national university, from 7,500 students in 1960 to over 32,000 in 2010. In 2007, UvA undertook the construction of the Science Park Amsterdam, a campus to house the Faculty of Science along with the new University Sports Center. Much of the park has now been completed. The University of Amsterdam began working in close collaboration with the &quot;Hogeschool van Amsterdam&quot;. In 2008, the University of Amsterdam and VU University jointly founded the Amsterdam University College (AUC), an interuniversity institute that offers a three-year Bachelor (Honors) program in the Liberal Arts and Sciences.

==== 2015 student and staff protests ====

In February 2015, the university experienced occupations of two of their buildings in protest over proposed budget cuts. These budget cuts occurred in the wake of the university&#x27;s attempt to deal with its speculative misjudgments and financial difficulties: in 2011, the university&#x27;s total outstanding debt had increased to €136 million.
The Bungehuis occupation ended with the arrest of the 46 protesters on 24 February 2015. The following day a group of protesters forced the door of the Maagdenhuis, the main administrative building of the UvA, and began occupying it, once again raising their demands. The occupation lasted 45 days; the occupiers were evicted on 11 April.

=== University logo ===
The current logo of the University of Amsterdam consists of a black square with three white Saint Andrew&#x27;s Crosses and a white &quot;U.&quot; This an adaptation of the coat of arms of Amsterdam which also uses a black background and three white or silver Saint Andrew&#x27;s Crosses. The three Saint Andrew&#x27;s Crosses have been said to represent the three plagues of Amsterdam: fire, floods, and the Black Death. Another rumor is that they represent three fords in the River Amstel. These two explanations have no historical basis, however. It is believed by historians that the coat of arms of Amsterdam is derived from the coat of arms of Jan Persijn, the lord of Amsterdam between 1280 and 1282. The &quot;U&quot; represents the word &quot;university&quot; while the colours and three crosses represent the city of Amsterdam.

== Campus ==

As a metropolitan institution, the University of Amsterdam has always been housed in old and new buildings scattered throughout the capital. Because UvA is not a separate, secluded campus, students and city residents readily mix, allowing Amsterdam to maintain close cultural and academic ties to the school. The majority of UvA&#x27;s buildings lie in the heart of Amsterdam, with only the faculties of Science, Medicine and Dentistry located outside the City Centre. The university lies within the largest megalopolis in the Netherlands, the Randstad, with a population 7.2 million inhabitants.

=== City Centre ===
The administration of the school and most of the faculties are located in the historic City Centre of Amsterdam, within the canal ring which is itself a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The facilities in this area date from as early as the 15th century to the 21st-century. Architectural styles represented include the Dutch Renaissance, Dutch Baroque, Art Deco, Amsterdam School, and International style. The &quot;Agnietenkapel&quot;, &quot;Maagdenhuis&quot;, &quot;Oost-Indisch Huis&quot;, &quot;Bushuis&quot;, and &quot;Oudemanhuispoort&quot; are designated as &quot;Rijksmonumenten&quot; (national monuments). The 15th century &quot;Agnietenkapel&quot;, where the university was founded was first constructed as a monastery chapel around 1470, but was later converted for use by the &quot;Athenaeum Illustre&quot; in 1631. The Agnes Gate in front of the &quot;Agnietenkapel&quot; is a major symbol of the university and dates back to 1571. It was renovated and moved to its current location in 1631. Another area is a former hospital converted into university buildings, the &quot;Binnengasthuis&quot;, which is considered the heart of UvA. The &quot;Maagdenhuis&quot; is the current headquarters of UvA and HvA administration. The building was built between 1783 and 1787 and was formerly an orphanage. The &quot;Oost-Indisch Huis&quot;, the former headquarters of the Dutch East India Company was built in 1606 and now used by UvA. The &quot;Oudemanhuispoort&quot; was made a university building in 1880. It was constructed in 1602 as a retirement house and now houses some departments of the Humanities faculty. One of the buildings of the University Library complex, the &quot;Bushuis&quot;, was built as an armory in 1606.

=== Science Park ===
The Faculty of Science is located on the east side of the city at the newly constructed Science Park Amsterdam. This campus contains UvA&#x27;s science facilities, research institutes, student housing, the University Sports Centre, and businesses. In order to attract distinguished students and researchers, the campus was built by collaboration between the University of Amsterdam, the City of Amsterdam, and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. In 2012, the Amsterdam University College was housed at the Science Park UvA campus.

=== Academic Medical Centre ===

In the southeastern Bijlmermeer neighbourhood, the Faculty of Medicine is housed in the Academic Medical Center (AMC), the Faculty of Medicine&#x27;s teaching and research hospital. It was formed in 1983 when the UvA Faculty of Medicine and two hospitals, Binnengasthuis and the Wilhelmina Gasthuis, combined. Shortly after in 1988, the Emma Children&#x27;s Hospital also moved to the AMC. It is one of Amsterdam&#x27;s level 1 trauma centers and strongly cooperates with the VU University Medical Center (VUmc).

=== Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam ===
The Faculty of Dentistry is located in the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA) in the southern &quot;Zuidas&quot; district on the campus of the VU University Medical Center. It was formed when the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit combined their Dentistry schools in 1984.

=== Roeterseiland Campus ===
The Roeterseiland Campus is an open city campus designed to offer future-proof teaching and research facilities. The Faculties of Economics and Business and Social and Behavioural Sciences are located at the Roeterseiland campus. The Faculty of Law has settled in August 2017 on the campus.

== Organisation and administration ==

=== Faculties ===
The university is divided into seven faculties, with each faculty headed by a dean. The faculties include the Faculties of Humanities, Social and Behavioural Sciences, Economics and Business, Science, Law, Medicine, and Dentistry. Students must be admitted to the faculty of their program before beginning their studies.

==== Faculty of Science ====
The Faculty of Science (Dutch: Faculteit der Natuurwetenschappen, Wiskunde en Informatica) (FNWI) covers a wide area of research and education. Research at the Faculty of Science covers the full width of the beta sciences. Spread across eight institutes, the main topics are astronomy, physics, mathematics, information sciences, life sciences, chemistry and biology.

The Faculty of Science offers 28 degree programmes for students, 7 of which are a joint degree with the Vrije Universiteit. There are 51 different nationalities studying at the Faculty of Science.

The Faculty of Science has around 6,800 students, as well as 1,700 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Around 50% of the staff are internationals. The main faculty buildings are located on the Science Park Amsterdam campus. 

==== Faculty of Humanities ====
The Faculty of Humanities () (FGw) comprises six departments: Dutch studies, History, European Studies and Religion, Archaeology and Classics, Language and Literature, Media studies, Philosophy, and Art and Cultural studies. With over 6,000 students and about 1000 employees, it is the largest humanities faculty in the Netherlands. It was established in 1997 after a merger of the Faculty of Language and Culture, the Faculty of Theology and the Faculty of Philosophy. In 2011, the faculty was ranked number one in the Netherlands for Philosophy and Linguistics with international ranking in these areas of 37th and 22nd respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;QS World University Rankings 2010/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of research, the faculty produced 726 academic publications in 2009.

The Centre for Latin American Research and Documentation (CEDLA) is also part of the Faculty of Humanities, with the centre holding one of Europe&#x27;s largest collections on Latin American information and publishing the European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies (ERLACS) academic journal.

==== Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences ====
The Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences () (FMG) is the largest educational and research institution in the social and behavioural sciences in the Netherlands. The faculty has approximately 10,000 students and 1,200 staff members.

==== Faculty of Law ====

The Faculty of Law () (FdR) is based in the newly redesigned Roetersiland campus. It was earlier housed in the Oudemanhuispoort, a historic building dating from 1602 situated in the center of Amsterdam. It has approximately 3,700 students and 330 academic staff members. 58% of academic staff is female. The Faculty offers nine LLM programs, of which two are taught in English. In addition the Faculty offers three advanced LLM programs, which are all taught in English. Research at the Faculty is undertaken by five research institutes which specialize in the following areas: International law, Private law, Environmental law, Labor law, and Information law. In terms of research, the faculty produced 451 academic publications in 2018. In the 2018 academic year, there were 41 PhD candidates, 67% of whom were female.

In 2015, a bequest from Trudie Vervoort-Jaarsma to the university established the Julia Henriëtte Jaarsma-Adolfs scholarship fund for assisting students pursuing an LLM in the law faculty. The bequest of €4 million was the largest single donation left to a Dutch university by a private citizen and was made to honor her mother&#x27;s legal career. A second scholarship in the name of Vervoort-Jaarsma&#x27;s daughter, Madeleine Vervoort, provides travel funds to students.

==== Faculty of Medicine ====
The Faculty of Medicine () (FdG), each year, approximately 350 first-year students begin their study of medicine at Amsterdam UMC. The first, three-year phase consists mainly of thematic teaching. The second, also three-year phase consists of training internships in and outside of Amsterdam UMC. In terms of research, the faculty produced 3,206 academic publications in 2009.

==== Faculty of Dentistry ====
The Academic Center for Dentistry in Amsterdam () (ACTA) was founded in 1984 through a merger of the two dentistry faculties of the Universiteit of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. ACTA conducts scientific research, teaches, and provides patient care in the field of dentistry. ACTA is one of the largest dentistry education and training programmes in the world, with 500 staff members, an annual new-student enrolment of 128 and a total student body of 1000. It consists of three departments. In terms of research, the faculty produced 228 academic publications in 2009.

=== Administration ===
The University of Amsterdam is headed by an executive board. The university is then divided into seven faculties, with each faculty headed by a dean. Teaching and research are carried out in various departments and institutes within the individual faculties. UvA has an annual budget of €600 million (approximately $850 million).

In 1992, the board of governors of the University of Amsterdam set up the UvA Holding BV in order to bring its commercial activities into a form that is compatible with private law. The University of Amsterdam holds all the shares of the subsidiaries of the holding. The subsidiaries are clustered into four activity areas which are increasingly outsourced to commercial enterprises and other market participants.

=== International cooperation ===
The intellectual and cultural atmosphere at UvA is internationally oriented. Amsterdam attracts students from the Netherlands and beyond: with over 2,500 international students and researchers from over 100 countries.

UvA has an extensive network of foreign partner universities, facilitating student and staff exchanges. Within Europe, UvA has Socrates/Erasmus exchange agreements with over 200 institutions. Outside Europe, it has close ties with approximately 40 universities on all continents.

== Academics ==

The university is accredited by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, which grants accreditation to institutions who meet a national system of regulations and quality assurance controls.

<doc id="546173" wikidata="Q78592" url="?curid=546173" title="Jakob Lorber">
<text>Jakob Lorber (22 July 1800 – 23 August 1864) was a Christian mystic and self-professed visionary from the Duchy of Styria who promoted liberal Universalism, and who referred to himself as &quot;God&#x27;s scribe&quot;. He wrote that, on 15 March 1840, he began hearing an &quot;inner voice&quot; from the &quot;region&quot; of his heart, thereafter transcribing what it said. By the time of his death, 24 years later, he had written over 10,000 pages of detailed manuscripts.

Primarily, his writings were published posthumously, amounting to a &quot;New Revelation&quot; and the contemporary &quot;Lorber movement&quot;. This formed one of the major European neo-revelationist movements, mostly active in German-speaking Europe, although parts of Lorber&#x27;s writings have been translated into over 20 languages (according to the website of the Lorber Publisher). Followers and adherents have not formed a sect or cult, but rather continue in their own denominations.

==Biography==
Jakob Lorber was born in Kanischa, a small village in the Jahring parish, Duchy of Styria (now Kaniža pri Jarenini in Lower Styria, Slovenia), to peasants Michael Lorber and his wife, Maria (née Tautscher). He trained as a village schoolteacher. A brief biography, by his friend Karl Gottfried Ritter von Leitner, indicates that Lorber was an &quot;uncomplicated&quot; person.

Lorber was observed, while writing, by several well-to-do men in the Styrian capital city of Graz, including Dr. Carl-Friedrich Zimpel, the mayor of Graz (Anton Hüttenbrenner) and his composer brother (Anselm Hüttenbrenner), poet and Secretary to the Estates Karl Gottfried von Leitner, a Dr. Anton Kammerhuber and Leopold Cantily (pharmacist of Graz), among others. Likewise, these men verified his simplistic way of life. Lorber was open and friendly regarding his transcriptions, yet found himself involved in petty investigations designed to prove that he was a staging a hoax. For instance, the wife of one of his friends was certain that Lorber had studied the material he was pretending to hear from the inner voice, yet she never found the scientific books she had suggested he was hiding, eventually finding his sole research material to be a copy of the Bible.

Lorber had musical talents, and learned the violin, taking lessons from the famed virtuoso Paganini, and once giving a concert at La Scala Opera House, Milan. In 1840, the same year that he claimed to begin hearing the inner voice, Lorber was offered the position of assistant musical director at the theatre in Trieste. He claimed that the inner voice, however, directed him to decline the position and follow a quiet life of solitude instead. Lorber&#x27;s writings reveal that the inner voice spoke freely in first person as the voice of Jesus Christ.

== Prose style ==
Lorber&#x27;s prose has been described as compelling, moving some readers to compare it with writings by other mystics such as Emanuel Swedenborg, Jakob Boehme and Rudolf Steiner. Lorber himself makes reference to Swedenborg, in his book &quot;From Hell to Heaven&quot; (book 2 chapter 104 verse 4) and in &quot;The Spiritual Sun&quot; (vol. 1, chap. 16).

==The Great Gospel of John==

In the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot;, the narrator, Jesus, explains that he is the creator of the material universe, which was designed both as a confinement of Satan, and so he could take upon himself the condition of a man. He says he did this to inspire his children who could otherwise not perceive him in his primordial form as a spirit. He gives descriptions of the eons of time involved in creating the Earth. He does so in a manner similar to the modern theory of evolution all the way up to the point several thousand years ago when Jesus placed Adam upon the Earth, which at the time contained man-like creatures who did not have free will, being simply the most clever of the animals.

In a comprehensive manner the &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot; continually emphasizes the importance of free will. In this book, heaven and hell are presented as conditions already within us, expressed according to whether we live in harmony or contrary to God&#x27;s divine order. The &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot; also states that the gospels of John and Matthew were written at the time of the events they chronicle; for instance, Lorber writes that Jesus specifically told Matthew to take notes during the Sermon on the Mount. Such an account is contrary to the current consensus of biblical scholarship which typically places the authorship of Matthew some years after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and that of John even later. However, in the &quot;Great Gospel of John,&quot; the narrator explains this, claiming that there were many writers who described him, including several authors named Matthew, who all wrote similarly over a period of many years.

==Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Laodiceans==

In 1844 Lorber claimed to have heard, by the inner voice, the &quot;lost&quot; letter Paul wrote to the assembly of the Laodiceans, as referred to in Colossians 4:16. 

Several texts purporting to be the lost letter survive, notably one brief text preserved in medieval Vulgate manuscripts, attested from the 6th century. Another candidate is attributed to Marcion, listed in the Muratorian fragment. Marcion&#x27;s text is lost, and the Vulgate text is widely recognized as pseudepigraphical, and was decreed uncanonical by the Council of Florence of 1439–43. There is no resemblance between the letters produced by Lorber via the inner voice and the original manuscripts that survived. Publisher of this Lorber manuscript claims that the letter&#x27;s being lost reflects the falling away of the Church from true Christianity.

== Reception ==

===Publication===
Lorber posthumously attracted a following, and his writings were published and frequently reprinted, mostly with &quot;Lorber &amp; Turm&quot;, a dedicated publisher based in Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany.
The original manuscripts and copies of some of the manuscripts by close friends of Lorber are still preserved in the archives of the &quot;Lorber &amp; Turm&quot; publisher.

The German philosopher E. F. Schumacher refers to the New Revelation (NR) in his book &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot; as follows: &quot;They (the books of the NR) contain many strange things which are unacceptable to modern mentality, but at the same time contain such plethora of high wisdom and insight that it would be difficult to find anything more impressive in the whole of world literature. Lorber&#x27;s books, at the same time, are full of statements on scientific matters which flatly contradicted the sciences of his time and anticipated a great deal of modern physics and astronomy... There is no rational explanation for the range, profundity and precision of their contents.&quot;

Lorber&#x27;s work is divided into several books which, in aggregate, are called the &quot;New Revelation&quot;.

His &quot;Great Gospel of John&quot; was published in ten volumes and frequently reprinted, the 8th edition dating to 1996.
The &quot;Gospel of Jacob&quot; appeared in a 12th edition in 2006.

Lorber&#x27;s works have partially been translated into English, appearing with &quot;Merkur Publishing&quot;.

===Adherents===

Lorber and his friends were members of the Roman Catholic Church, and Lorber&#x27;s revelations asked them not to leave the church, but to convince it of the genuinely divine nature of the &quot;New Revelation&quot; by leading exemplary lives. Occultist Leopold Engel was one of Lorber&#x27;s followers, and also wrote an 11th volume, claiming to be a follow-up to Lorber&#x27;s The Great Gospel of John close to 30 years after Lorber&#x27;s death. 

There is a movement of adherents of Lorber&#x27;s writings (&quot;Lorber-Bewegung, Lorberianer, Lorber-Gesellschaften&quot;), mostly active in German-speaking Europe. There is no organizational structure beyond small regional circles. While there is no accurate estimate of the total number of adherents, it likely exceeds 100,000 worldwide.

===Status in the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message===
In one of the sacred books of all the three factions of the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel, Lorber is named as one of the servants of God from the German-speaking area.

===Criticism===
One main point of criticism of Lorber&#x27;s works was the use of the first person as if the writings were dictated by Jesus Christ himself.
Additionally, some of his statements can be considered anti-semitic, and Lorber was in fact lauded by the anti-semitic proponents of Ariosophy, a form of racial mysticism, during the 1920s, e.g. by Lanz von Liebenfels, who in 1926 called Jakob Lorber &quot;the greatest ariosophic medium of the modern era&quot; (&quot;das grösste ariosophische Medium der Neuzeit&quot;). Then again it is said in the books of Lorber, that salvation comes to all men from the Jews, and that one should in all truth return to Judaism and that the God of the Jews is the only true, eternal God. It is also said to be the will of God or Jesus that all men should be friends, whether they are Jews or gentiles.

Kurt Hutten, former chairman of the &quot;Evangelische Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen&quot; (EZW, an apologetic institution of the Evangelical Church in Germany) has identified Swedenborg and Lorber as recipients of equally valid private revelation. Official statements of the EZW are more skeptical, assuming psychological explanations for Lorber&#x27;s revelations. EZW points to a 1966 Berne dissertation by Antoinette Stettler-Schär which diagnosed Lorber with paranoid schizophrenia. This diagnosis has been dismissed by Bernhard Grom, who diagnoses self-induced hallucination. Andreas Finke, vice-chairman of the EZW, concludes that the content of Lorber&#x27;s revelations reflect both the period during which they were written down and the knowledge of their author, identifying them as &quot;pious poetry in the best sense of the term, but not divine dictation.&quot;

<text>The Art of Unix Programming by Eric S. Raymond is a book about the history and culture of Unix programming from its earliest days in 1969 to 2003 when it was published, covering both genetic derivations such as BSD and conceptual ones such as Linux.

The author utilizes a comparative approach to explaining Unix by contrasting it to other operating systems including desktop-oriented ones such as Microsoft Windows and the classic Mac OS to ones with research roots such as EROS and Plan 9 from Bell Labs.
The book was published by Addison-Wesley, September 17, 2003, and is also available online, under a Creative Commons license with additional clauses.

==Contributors==
The book contains many contributions, quotations and comments from UNIX gurus past and present. These include:

*Ken Arnold (author of curses and co-author of &quot;Rogue&quot;)
*Steve Bellovin
*Stuart Feldman
*Jim Gettys
*Stephen C. Johnson
*Brian Kernighan

<text>The Central Statistics Office (CSO; ) is the statistical agency responsible for the gathering of &quot;information relating to economic, social and general activities and conditions&quot; in Ireland, in particular the census which is held every five years. The office is answerable to the Taoiseach and has its main offices in Cork. The Director General of the CSO is Jennifer Banim.

== History ==

The CSO was established on a statutory basis in 1994 to reduce the number of separate offices responsible for collecting statistics for the state.

The CSO had existed, as an independent office within the Department of the Taoiseach from June 1949, and its work greatly increased in the following decades particularly from 1973 with Ireland joining the European Community. Previous to the 1949 reforms, statistics were collected by the Statistics Branch of Department of Industry and Commerce on the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. The Statistics Branch amalgamated a number of statistics gathering organisations that had existed in Ireland since 1841, when the first comprehensive census was undertaken by the Royal Irish Constabulary.

On 15 September 2020, on the advice of the Central Statistics Office, the Government postponed the population census, originally scheduled for 18 April 2021, until 3 April 2022 because of health and logistical obstacles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Head of the Office ==
The current Director-General of the Central Statistics Office is Jennifer Banim.

== Household Finance and Consumption Survey ==
In 2013 the first ever Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) was conducted in Ireland by the Central Statistics Office on behalf of the Central Bank of Ireland as part of the European Central Bank (ECB) HFCS scheme/network.

<text>Senenmut (, sometimes spelled Senmut, Senemut, or Senmout) was an 18th Dynasty ancient Egyptian architect and government official. His name translates literally as &quot;brother of mother&quot;.

== Family ==
Senenmut was of low commoner birth, born to literate provincial parents, Ramose and Hatnofer (or &quot;Hatnefret&quot;) from Iuny (modern Armant). Senenmut is known to have had three brothers (Amenemhet, Minhotep, and Pairy) and two sisters (Ahhotep and Nofrethor). However, only Minhotep is named outside chapel in his tomb TT71 and in his hypogeum TT353, in an inventory on the lid of a chest found in the burial chamber of Ramose and Hatnofer. More information is known about Senenmut than many other non-royal Egyptians because the joint tomb of his parents (the construction of which Senenmut supervised himself) was discovered intact by the Metropolitan Museum in the mid-1930s and preserved. Christine Meyer has offered compelling evidence to show that Senenmut was a bachelor for his entire life: for instance, Senenmut is portrayed alone with his parents in the funerary stelae of his tombs; he was depicted alone, rather than with a wife, in the vignette of Chapter 110 from the Book of the Dead in hypogeum numbered as TT353 and, finally, it was one of Senenmut&#x27;s own brothers, and not one of his sons, who was charged with the execution of Senenmut&#x27;s funerary rites.
==Career==
Senenmut first enters the historical record on a national level as the &quot;Steward of the God&#x27;s Wife&quot; (Hatshepsut) and &quot;Steward of the King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (Neferure). Some Egyptologists place Senenmut&#x27;s entry into royal service during the reign of Thutmose I, but it is far more likely that it occurred during either the reign of Thutmose II or while Hatshepsut was still regent and not pharaoh. After Hatshepsut was crowned pharaoh, Senenmut was given more prestigious titles and became &quot;high steward of the king&quot;.

Senenmut supervised the quarrying, transport, and erection of twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, at the entrance to the Temple of Karnak. Neither stands today though they were commemorated in the Chapelle Rouge. Karnak&#x27;s Red Chapel was intended as a barque shrine and may have originally stood between the two obelisks. (The remaining obelisks of Hatshepsut were erected in Year Fifteen as part of her Heb Sed Festival; one still stands in the Temple of Karnak whilst the other is in pieces, having fallen many centuries ago.)
Senenmut claims to be the chief architect of Hatshepsut&#x27;s works at Deir el-Bahri. Senenmut&#x27;s masterpiece building project was the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, also known as the Djeser-Djeseru, designed and implemented by Senenmut on a site on the west bank of the Nile, close to the entrance to the Valley of the Kings. The focal point was the Djeser-Djeseru or &quot;the Sublime of the Sublimes&quot; mortuary temple-(&#x27;Holy (of) Holiests&#x27;), a colonnaded structure of perfect harmony built nearly one thousand years before the Parthenon. Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of terraces that were once graced with gardens. It is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it. Djeser-Djeseru and the other buildings of the Deir el-Bahri complex are considered to be among the great buildings of the ancient world. The building complex design is thought to be derived from the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II built nearly 500 years earlier at Deir-el-Bahri. Senenmut&#x27;s importance at the royal court under Hatshepsut is unquestionable:
:he was able to lay immediate claim to prime construction sites at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna and Deir el Bahri itself for the excavation of his tomb chapel and burial chamber.
Senenmut&#x27;s Theban Tomb 71 was started late in Year 7, &quot;shortly after Hatshepsut&#x27;s accession, the death of Hatnofer, and Hatnofer&#x27;s interment with the exhumed remains of several family members&quot;, while the &quot;excavation on the chapel seems to have continued until after Year 7&quot; of the female pharaoh&#x27;s reign. Senenmut&#x27;s tomb appears to have enjoyed Hatshepsut&#x27;s favour and &quot;his portrayal in the Punt reliefs certainly postdates Year 9&quot; of Hatshepsut.

The earliest known astronomical ceiling in Egypt is found as a main part of a decor in the hypogeum-cenotaph of Senenmut. The astronomical ceiling in Senenmut’s hypogeum (numbered as TT 353) is divided into two sections, representing the northern and southern skies. This indicates another dimension of his career, suggesting that he was an ancient astronomer as well.

Some Egyptologists have theorized that Senenmut was Hatshepsut&#x27;s lover. Facts that are typically cited to support the theory are that Hatshepsut allowed Senenmut to place his name and an image of himself behind one of the main doors in Djeser-Djeseru, and the presence of graffiti in an unfinished tomb used as a rest house by the workers of Djeser-Djeseru depicting a male and a hermaphrodite in pharaonic regalia engaging in an explicit sexual act.

Although it is not known where he is buried, Senenmut had a tomb constructed for himself and a cenotaph-hypogeum. The unfinished tomb is at (TT71) in the Tombs of the Nobles and his cenotaph-hypogeum (numbered as TT353), near Hatshepsut&#x27;s mortuary temple, and contains a famous star ceiling. They were both heavily vandalized during the reign of Thutmose III, perhaps during the latter&#x27;s campaign to eradicate all trace of Hatshepsut&#x27;s memory. Neither tomb by itself was complete, as would be expected of an Egyptian tomb for a person of high standing. TT71 is a typical Theban Tomb with a shaft and unfinished burial chambers. His cenotaph-hypogeum (numbered as TT353) is fully underground without any overground chapel. They complement each other and are only, together, a full burial monument. However, the work carried out on the hypogeum TT353 by the Archaeological Mission of the Instituto de Estudios del Antiguo Egipto (2000-2008), proves that it is a hypogeum to perform Senenmut transformation rites.

<text>In theoretical physics, a non-abelian gauge transformation means a gauge transformation taking values in some group &quot;G&quot;, the elements of which do not obey the commutative law when they are multiplied. By contrast, the original choice of gauge group in the physics of electromagnetism had been U(1), which is commutative.

For a non-abelian Lie group &quot;G&quot;, its elements do not commute, i.e. they in general do &quot;not&quot; satisfy 

:formula_1. 

The quaternions marked the introduction of non-abelian structures in mathematics.

In particular, its generators formula_2,
which form a basis for the vector space of infinitesimal transformations (the Lie algebra), have a commutation rule:

:formula_3

The structure constants formula_4 quantify the lack of commutativity, and do not vanish. We can deduce that the structure constants are antisymmetric in the first two indices and real. The normalization is usually chosen (using the Kronecker delta) as 

:formula_5

Within this orthonormal basis, the structure constants are then antisymmetric with respect to all three indices.

An element formula_6 of the group can be expressed near the identity element in the form 

:formula_7,
where formula_8 are the parameters of the transformation.

Let formula_9 be a field that transforms covariantly in a given representation formula_10. 
This means that under a transformation we get

:formula_11

Since any representation of a compact group is equivalent to a unitary representation, we take 

:formula_10 

to be a unitary matrix without loss of generality.
We assume that the Lagrangian formula_13 depends only on the field formula_9 and the derivative formula_15:

:formula_16

If the group element formula_6 is independent of the spacetime coordinates (global symmetry), the derivative of the transformed 
field is equivalent to the transformation of the field derivatives:

:formula_18

Thus the field formula_19 and its derivative transform in the same way. By the unitarity of the representation, 
scalar products like formula_20, formula_21 or formula_22 are invariant under global 
transformation of the non-abelian group.

Any Lagrangian constructed out of such scalar products is globally invariant:

:formula_23

<text>Spiderbait is an Australian alternative rock band from Finley, New South Wales, formed in 1989 by bass guitarist and singer Janet English, drummer and singer Kram, and guitarist Damian Whitty. In 2004, the group&#x27;s cover version of the 1930s Lead Belly song &quot;Black Betty&quot; reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have five top 20 albums: &quot;The Unfinished Spanish Galleon of Finley Lake&quot; (1995), &quot;Ivy and the Big Apples&quot; (1996), &quot;Grand Slam&quot; (1999), &quot;Tonight Alright&quot; (2004), and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2005). The group have won two ARIA Music Awards with the first in 1997 as &#x27;Best Alternative Release&#x27; for &quot;Ivy and the Big Apples&quot; and the second in 2000 as &#x27;Best Cover-Art&#x27; for their single &quot;Glockenpop&quot;. In November 2013, the band released its first studio album in nine years, &quot;Spiderbait&quot;.

==History==
===1989–1994: Early years===
In 1989, Janet English on bass guitar and lead vocals, Mark Maher (better known as Kram) on lead vocals and drums, and Damian Whitty (or &quot;Whitt&quot;) on guitar, began performing together. All grew up in the small town of Finley in southern New South Wales where Kram and his second cousin Whitty jammed together as schoolboys. With English on board, early rehearsals were held in sheds or barns, Kram later recalled: &quot;we were shithouse! We were so bad ... I mean Janet had never played a note of music in her life&quot;. Kram taught English to play bass. Initial gigs included a friend&#x27;s party as an unnamed band where they played &quot;Freak Scene&quot; and an AC/DC song. They performed at the combined 21st birthday party for Kram and Whitty under the name Candy Spuds. They used that name for only one gig and then used Spiderbaby.

In 1990, the trio moved to Melbourne, where Kram was studying at the Victorian College of the Arts School of Music. They soon became part of Melbourne&#x27;s punk scene, playing gigs at venues like The Tote Hotel in Collingwood. Fellow alternative rockers The Meanies were an early influence and helped the band get gigs and a recording contract. They signed with Au-Go-Go Records and were renamed as Spiderbait – Spiderbaby was already being used by an American band. Spiderbait released their first single, &quot;Circle K&quot;, in 1991. A seven-track EP titled &quot;P&#x27;tang Yang Kipper Bang Uh!&quot; (named after the 1982 Michael Apted telemovie, &quot;P&#x27;tang, Yang, Kipperbang&quot;) followed in January 1992, displaying the thrash-like hardcore punk of their early live gigs. During 1992 they supported United States groups Rollins Band and Beastie Boys on their tour of Australia.

Spiderbait&#x27;s first album, &quot;Shashavaglava&quot;, was released in May 1993. &#x27;Šašava glava&#x27; (written as Шашава Глава) means &#x27;crazy head&#x27; in Serbian or possibly &#x27;dickhead&#x27;. The album included all the tracks from &quot;P&#x27;tang Yang Kipper Bang Uh!&quot; and featured the songs &quot;Old Man Sam&quot;, in which the film clip featured Kram&#x27;s brother Adam doing donuts in his car and Kram&#x27;s Grandpa, and a cover of English comedians The Goodies&#x27; song &quot;Run&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s David Colon found the album &quot;agitating&quot; where its &quot;thrashing and pounding may be meant to energize, but in the end, only enervates.&quot; &quot;Run&quot; was released as a CD single in March 1994 and was followed by &quot;Jesus&quot;. The group supported US band Primus on their Australia 1994 tour.

===1995–1998: Major-label-signing, Ivy &amp; The Big Apples and side-projects===
In 1995, Spiderbait was signed to Polydor Records by Craig Kamber - who also worked with Powderfinger and Underground Lovers - and released its second album, &quot;The Unfinished Spanish Galleon of Finley Lake&quot;, in October. The album reached number 14 on the Australian charts, with singles &quot;Monty&quot; (September) and &quot;Jesus&quot; receiving extensive airplay on radio station Triple J. The album title refers to a then-unfinished project by the Finley community, an artificially-made lake included a replica sailing ship. Spiderbait played to predominantly under-18 audiences. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996, the album received two nominations: &#x27;Best Alternative Release&#x27;, and &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; for English and George Stajsic.

Their third album, &quot;Ivy and the Big Apples&quot;, was issued in October 1996 and reached number 3, and by 1997 had received 2× Platinum certification by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of over 140,000 units in Australia. Their next single, &quot;Buy Me a Pony&quot;, received extensive airplay on Triple J, resulting in listeners voting it as their favourite song in the Hottest 100 of 1996 – making Spiderbait the first Australian group to achieve this. In October 1996, the group toured Canada and played gigs in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle in the US. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Calypso&quot;, also achieved commercial airplay, and reached number 13 in the ARIA Singles Chart in June 1997. It was featured in the 1999 film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; during the scene where the character of Kat (played by Julia Stiles) is reading the novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; by Sylvia Plath. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 the group received seven nominations, but with Savage Garden dominating the ceremony and winning ten awards, Spiderbait only captured the &#x27;Best Alternative Release&#x27; category for &quot;Ivy and the Big Apples&quot;.

In early 1998, English and her then-boyfriend Quan Yeomans (of Regurgitator) formed a side-project, Happyland (originally called The Shits), which released their only album, &quot;Welcome to Happyland&quot;, on Polydor in September. English provided cover art work and 3-D animated videos for Regurgitator releases. By 2000 the couple and Happyland had split. Also in 1998, Kram and Richie Lewis of Tumbleweed formed a side-project, Hot Rollers – so named as both member&#x27;s mothers were hairdressers. Their only album, &quot;The Hot Rollers&quot;, was issued in July through Polydor.

===1999–2004: &quot;Grand Slam&quot; to &quot;Tonight alright&quot;===
Spiderbait reconvened in June 1998 to record the album &quot;Grand Slam&quot;. They toured Japan in October 1998 and supported the Beastie Boys in February 1999. The album, produced by Paul McKercher (who had also produced You Am I and Cold Chisel), was issued in April, and debuted at number 10. &quot;Shazam!&quot; was released as a single in February, which reached the top 50. It was featured in a 2001 episode of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; entitled &quot;The Real Me&quot; as part of a fashion show scene. In 2009, it was used in promotional advertising for the A-League. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 the group received five nominations.

Despite good airplay for the &quot;Grand Slam&quot; singles &quot;Stevie&quot; (May) and &quot;Glokenpop&quot; (January 2000), neither charted in the top 50. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 the group received two nominations and English won &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; for her work on &quot;Glokenpop&quot;. Their 2001 dance-influenced album &quot;The Flight of Wally Funk&quot; was less successful than their previous three albums, although it reached the Top 40. It was recorded mostly in Whitty&#x27;s living room.

Spiderbait recorded the &quot;Tonight Alright&quot; album in Weed, CA with engineers Josh Kiser and Richard Veltrop, producer Sylvia Massy (Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., Tool, System of a Down, Skunk Anansie). The songs had been written and demoed at Whitty&#x27;s home in North Melbourne with English and Kram cycling in from nearby suburbs. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Black Betty&quot;, was released in early March 2004. It was a cover version of the 1930s Lead Belly song which was a hit in 1977 when covered by Ram Jam. Spiderbait&#x27;s version reached number one after 10 weeks in the singles chart in May 2004, and stayed there for three weeks, becoming their biggest selling single ever. By the end of the year, &quot;Black Betty&quot; received 2× Platinum certification. In the US, it reached the top 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Singles Chart. The film clip featured a hot rod similar to the car on the cover of the ZZ Top album &quot;Eliminator&quot;. The song also made the soundtrack to the Electronic Arts video games &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed: Underground Rivals&quot; for the PSP.

&quot;Tonight Alright&quot; was released in March 2004 and debuted at number 14 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The second single, &quot;Fucken Awesome&quot;, reached the top 30 in June. From May, the group toured supporting Hoodoo Gurus, followed by their own tour to United Kingdom and US. Interscope Records signed the band in 2004 to distribute &quot;Tonight Alright&quot; in the US and UK. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, Kram performed as part of the super-group The Wrights, which also featured members of Powderfinger, The Living End, You Am I, Jet, Grinspoon, and Dallas Crane.

===2005–2012: On hiatus and touring===
In March 2005, English gave birth to a daughter. In September, Spiderbait released a compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which debuted at number 6. According to their official website, they had discovered that newer fans were unaware of their material before &quot;Black Betty&quot;.

In October 2005, Spiderbait performed at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, as part of the Coca-Cola Live&#x27;n&#x27;Local Tour &#x27;05. In November 2006, the band performed at the &quot;Queensland Council of Unions&quot;-organized Rock the Vote! concert in Brisbane.

The band recorded a cover of &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; as the main theme for the film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (2007), starring Nicolas Cage. A small excerpt is played during the film, and then in its entirety as the first song when the credits roll. The band&#x27;s song &quot;Glokenpop&quot; is featured in the 2009 game &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. Kram released his debut solo album, &quot;Mix Tape&quot;, in March 2009. In 2010, Magnapop&#x27;s album &quot;Chase Park&quot; featured a cover of Spiderbait&#x27;s song &quot;Jesus&quot; from &quot;The Unfinished Spanish Galleon of Finley Lake&quot;. In December of that year, they supported Guns N&#x27; Roses at a Sydney gig. The band recorded a cover of &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Bear&quot; for the compilation &quot;ReWiggled - A Tribute to the Wiggles&quot;.

===2013–2021: End of hiatus and self-titled album===
In an interview with Triple J in February 2013, Kram announced that Spiderbait were in the studio, working on their first album in seven years, saying &quot;We&#x27;re doing a new record and we&#x27;re about halfway through. We&#x27;re just writing demos at the moment and it&#x27;s coming along well. We&#x27;re back in our Motorhead and Metallica metal phase—I&#x27;m all double kick at the moment.&quot;

The self-titled album, &quot;Spiderbait&quot;, was released on 15 November 2013. The band played a gig on the same day, for the opening night of the Jam Gallery, a new music venue in Bondi Junction.

===2022-present: &quot;Sounds in the Key of J and touring&quot;===
On 11 March 2022, the band released &quot;My Car&#x27;s a UFO&quot;, their first new song in nine years. The track was initially recorded for &quot;The Flight of Wally Funk&quot; and served as the lead single from the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Sounds in the Key of J&quot;—which collects every Spiderbait song that Janet English sings lead vocals on. The compilation was released on 8 April 2022, with a supporting tour that followed that July.

On 17 June 2023, Spiderbait performed their first show in the U.S. in over 25 years in New York City at the Aussie BBQ Festival. Other acts that were there were Amy Shark and Budjerah. In December 2023, Spiderbait performed at Good Things, alongside other bands like Limp Bizkit, Devo, Fall Out Boy and more.

On 15 May 2024, Spiderbait announced that they would tour Australia from August to October of that year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Black Betty&quot;, with opening acts like Polish Club, Adalita, Private Function, Abbe May and local bands.

On 20 September 2024, the band released &quot;Bunch of Bettys&quot;, an extended play full of different recordings of &quot;Black Betty&quot;, such as &quot;Live Betty&quot; (recorded at the Tivoli in Brisbane on 31 March 2017), &quot;Demo Betty&quot;, &quot;4-Track Betty&quot;, &quot;Barn Betty&quot;, &quot;Fuzzy Betty&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Betty&quot; and the original cover from Tonight Alright. On that same day, the band&#x27;s concert in Melbourne at the Forum Theatre was filmed in its entirety, but is yet to be released.

<doc id="546208" wikidata="Q221514" url="?curid=546208" title="Manoah">
<text>Manoah ( &quot;Mānoaḥ&quot;) is a figure from the Book of Judges 13:1-23 and 14:2-4 of the Hebrew Bible. His name means &quot;rest&quot;. He is the father of the judge Samson.

== Family ==
According to the Bible, Manoah was of the tribe of Dan and lived in the city of Zorah. He married one woman, who was barren. Her name is not mentioned in the Bible, but according to tradition she was called Hazzelelponi or Zelelponith. She was a daughter of Etam and sister of Ishma.

Manoah and his wife were the parents of famous judge Samson. According to Rabbinic tradition, they also had a daughter called Nishyan or Nashyan.

==Birth of Samson==
Manoah and his barren wife were childless, but the angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah&#x27;s wife and told her that she would give birth to a son. The child was to be dedicated from the womb as a Nazirite, which entailed restrictions on his diet that the angel spelled out in detail. The woman, whose name is not mentioned in the Bible, told her husband, &quot;A man of God came to me.&quot; Manoah prayed, and the angel returned to instruct the both of them. After the angel left, Manoah tells his wife, &quot;We shall surely die, because we have seen God.&quot;

Together with his wife, Manoah subsequently tried to dissuade Samson from marrying a Philistine woman but traveled with him to Timnah for the wedding ceremony when they were unable to do so.

Samson&#x27;s birth has special importance for some Christians (primarily Catholics) because of its similarity to the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary.

After Samson&#x27;s death, his family recovers his body and buries him near the tomb of Manoah.

== In culture ==
* In John Milton&#x27;s closet play &quot;Samson Agonistes,&quot; Manoah visits Samson after his imprisonment by the Philistines, and attempts to ransom them for his freedom.
* In the 1914 American film &quot;Samson&quot;, Manoah was played by George Periolat, while his wife was played by Lule Warrenton.
* In the 1949 film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (starring Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr), Manoah is played by Charles Evans in an uncredited appearance.
* In the 1984 film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, Manoah is played by Victor Mature.
* In the 1996 film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, Manoah, played by Paul Freeman, is shown as a poor old man. His wife is called Mara in this film.
* In the 2018 film &quot;Samson&quot;, Manoah is played by Rutger Hauer and his wife (called Zealphonis) is played by Lindsay Wagner.

<text>Woodbine Racetrack is a race track for Thoroughbred horse racing in the Etobicoke area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Owned by Woodbine Entertainment Group, Woodbine Racetrack manages and hosts Canada&#x27;s most famous race, the King&#x27;s Plate. The track was opened in 1956 with a one-mile oval dirt track, as well as a seven-eights turf course. It has been extensively remodeled since 1993, and since 1994 has had three racecourses.

==History==

The current Woodbine carries the name originally used by a racetrack which operated in southeast Toronto, at Queen Street East and Kingston Road, from 1874 through 1993. (While the Old Woodbine Race Course was at the south end of Woodbine Avenue, the current Woodbine is nowhere near it.) In 1951, it was operated by the Ontario Jockey Club (OJC) and held the prestigious King&#x27;s Plate, but it competed with several other racetracks in Ontario and was in need of modernization.

During the 1950s, the OJC, under the leadership of Canadian industrialist and horse breeder E.P. Taylor, began a program of racetrack acquisitions aimed at becoming the biggest and most profitable operator in Ontario horse racing, similar to Taylor&#x27;s earlier acquisitions and consolidations in the Canadian brewing industry. In 1952, the OJC purchased and closed the money-losing Thorncliffe Park, purchased and closed the Hamilton Racetrack, and purchased the Fort Erie Racetrack for . Renovations began immediately at Fort Erie and at Woodbine, financed by a public offering of stock for .

In 1953, the OJC bought Stamford Park in Stamford township (now part of Niagara Falls, Ontario). It was closed and later redeveloped into a residential subdivision. In 1955, Taylor himself purchased the competing Orpen-owned Dufferin Park Racetrack and Long Branch Racetracks for million ($ in dollars). The Orpen tracks were closed and redeveloped, and the Orpen race charters transferred to the OJC. The OJC continued the Canadian International and Cup and Saucer stakes races that had been held at the Orpen tracks. The racing charters acquired from the other tracks enabled the OJC to run 196 days of racing, more than double its allowed total of 84 days in 1952.

All of the efforts at racetrack acquisitions and closures were designed to support a new &quot;supertrack&quot;. In 1952, the OJC identified the new location of the racetrack at Highway 27 east of the Toronto airport and bought over . The architect chosen was Earle C. Morgan. Although Morgan had not designed a racetrack, he spent the next two years developing the design in conjunction with Arthur Froelich, who had designed Hollywood Park Racetrack and Garden State Park Racetrack in the United States. The new track was designed to hold 40,000 spectators, have ample parking, three race courses and two training tracks. It had stable space for 1,000 horses and rooms for 700 employees. The grandstand, designed to get as many people as close to the finish line as possible, included several restaurants and cafeterias. Construction on the new supertrack began in 1955.

The new racetrack opened on June 12, 1956, built at a cost of million ($ in dollars). It was initially known as the New Woodbine Racetrack. It dropped the &quot;New&quot; in 1963. The old track was converted to a combined thoroughbred and standardbred track known thereafter as Old Woodbine or, for most of the rest of its history, as Greenwood Raceway (during standardbred meets) and Greenwood Race Track (during thoroughbred meets). The two thoroughbred and two standardbred meets conducted at Greenwood were transferred to the new Woodbine in 1994, which was until then exclusively devoted to thoroughbred racing. On June 30, 1959, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh attended the 100th running of the Queen&#x27;s Plate, and Queen Elizabeth II again on July 4, 2010, attended the 151st running of the Queen&#x27;s Plate Stakes and presented trophies.

The track was the opening venue for the 1976 Summer Paralympics, and some of the sporting events were held here. The Arlington Million was held at Woodbine in 1988. The Breeders&#x27; Cup was held at Woodbine in 1996. The Woodbine facility is also home to the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. In 2018, the track began using a GPS-based timing system.

In 2022, Woodbine announced plans to add an 8,000-seat soccer-specific stadium and adjoining training facilities in the northeast corner of the property; this would be the presumed new home of York United FC and possibly house a future professional women&#x27;s soccer club.

==Physical attributes==

The outermost E. P. Taylor turf course for thoroughbreds, completed in 1994, is long with a chute allowing races of to be run around one turn. It is irregularly shaped, the clubhouse turn departing from the traditional North American oval, and the backstretch is from to higher than the homestretch. The Taylor turf course and the main dirt course at Belmont Park on New York&#x27;s Long Island are the only mile-and-a-half layouts in North American thoroughbred racing. In 2016, Woodbine will contest up to 40 turf races running clockwise (right-hand turns) in what are being billed as &quot;EuroTurf&quot; races.

Inside the Taylor course is the synthetic course for Thoroughbreds. Since April 9, 2016, the surface has been Tapeta; it was Polytrack from August 31, 2006 through 2015, and a natural dirt surface prior to that. Two chutes facilitate races at seven furlongs [] and at .

The innermost oval was originally a 7/8-mile [] grass oval until the E. P. Taylor turf course opened in 1994. It was then converted to a crushed limestone dirt course and was used for harness racing until April 2018. It was then converted back to a second turf course for the 2019 thoroughbred racing season. The first race on the new Inner Turf was run on June 28, 2019 and was won by Bold Rally with Eurico Rosa da Silva aboard.

Portions of the current E. P. Taylor turf course (the backstretch and far turn) originally formed part of a long turf chute that crossed over the dirt course to the inner turf oval at the top of the stretch. This was used for several major races, including Secretariat&#x27;s final race in the 1973 Canadian International, until the entire E. P. Taylor course was completed in 1994.

===Incidents===
In November 2024, Woodbine cancelled its November 10 final 2 racecard after three catastrophic injuries on the Tapeta track surface as a precautionary approach. It consulted the National HBPA, the Jockeys&#x27; Guild and the AGCO. The incidents include a breakdown of an unnamed horse during a workout, the 3-year-old filly Social Dancer (Society&#x27;s Chairman)&#x27;s awkward step at the half-mile marker and in the GIII Bessarabian Stakes, the 6-year-old mare Owen&#x27;s Tour Guide (Tourist)&#x27;s wrong step, resulting in their euthanasia.

==Casino==
Casino Woodbine opened in 1999, offering a slots parlor and later expanded to table games in 2018. It contains 100+ table games, 3,500+ slot machines, 220+ electronic table games, and 100+ dealer assist stadium gaming. Table games include blackjack, roulette and baccarat. It is open 24 hours a day.

In 2019, construction began to expand the casino to include an entertainment venue, retail shops and a hotel.

==Horse racing==
===Standardbred races===
Woodbine has been a regular host for the Breeders Crown. Since the event changed to a one-night format in 2010, the facility has hosted three times—2011, 2012, and 2015.

Woodbine was also the host of the North America Cup for three-year old pacing colts and geldings from 1994–2006. That race along with the Elegant Image Stakes for three-year old filly trotters and the Good Times Stakes for three-year old colt and gelding trotters, have been moved to Woodbine&#x27;s sister track, Woodbine Mohawk Park.

Starting in 2018, all standardbred racing has been moved to Woodbine Mohawk, as the 7/8 standardbred track is being converted into a 2nd turf course.

===Thoroughbred races===
The record for most wins by a jockey on a single raceday at Woodbine is seven, set by Richard Grubb on May 16, 1967, and twice equaled by the legendary Canadian jockey Sandy Hawley, first on May 22, 1972 and then again on October 10, 1974.

<text>Charles Ardai is an American businessman, and writer of crime fiction and mysteries. He is co-founder and editor of Hard Case Crime, a line of pulp-style paperback crime novels. He was also an early employee of D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. and a managing director of the firm. He is the former chairman of Schrödinger, Inc.

==Early life==
A New York native and the son of two Holocaust survivors, Ardai told NPR in a May 2008 interview that the stories his parents told him as a child &quot;were the most grim and frightening that you can imagine&quot; and gave him the impression &quot;there was a darker circle around a very small bit of light,&quot; something that enabled him to relate to his own characters&#x27; sufferings.

While in high school, Ardai enjoyed reading pulp fiction and worked as an intern at &quot;Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;.

After graduating from Hunter College High School in 1987, he attended Columbia University, where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1991.

==Career==
Right out of college, Ardai was hired by hedge fund D. E. Shaw. His first job at the firm was to set up its recruiting department, with a goal of hiring &quot;people who really excel in one field or another.&quot; 

Sometime in the early 1990s, Shaw tasked Ardai and Jeff Bezos with coming up with potential online business ideas. While Ardai founded Juno, an internet company, in 1996 with D. E. Shaw as an investor, Bezos went on to found Amazon.com on his own. After Juno was sold in 2001, Ardai and Max Phillips decided to start a publishing company to publish crime fiction in the pulp magazine style they grew up enjoying. That proposed company became Hard Case Crime, which published its first books in 2004. Hard Case&#x27;s books were produced by Dorchester Publishing and Ardai&#x27;s Winterfall, LLC between 2004 and 2010 and have been produced by Titan Books and Winterfall since 2011 (together with a related comics imprint launched in 2016).

Ardai&#x27;s writing has appeared in mystery magazines such as &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, gaming magazines such as &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, and anthologies such as &quot;Best Mysteries of the Year&quot; and &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Horror Stories&quot;. Ardai has also edited numerous short story collections such as &quot;The Return of the Black Widowers&quot;, &quot;Great Tales of Madness and the Macabre&quot;, and &quot;Futurecrime&quot;.

In 1994, Ardai&#x27;s short story &quot;Nobody Wins,&quot; published in 1993 by &quot;Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine&quot;, received a Shamus nomination for Best P.I. Short Story.

His first novel, &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; (2004) was nominated for both the Edgar Allan Poe Award by the Mystery Writers of America and the Shamus Award by the Private Eye Writers of America. His second novel, &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot;, was called &quot;an instant classic&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, selected as one of the best books of the year by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and won the 2008 Shamus Award. Both books were written under the alias Richard Aleas and were optioned for the movies by Universal Pictures.

He received the Edgar Award in 2007 for the short story &quot;The Home Front&quot;. Ardai&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Fifty-to-One&quot;, was published in November 2008. It was the fiftieth book in the &quot;Hard Case Crime&quot; series and the first to be published under Ardai&#x27;s real name.

His fourth novel, &quot;Hunt Through the Cradle of Fear&quot;, is part of a pulp adventure series he created in 2009, describing the globetrotting exploits of a modern-day explorer named Gabriel Hunt. Authorship of all the books in this series were originally credited to Gabriel Hunt himself.
In 2010, Ardai began working as a writer and producer on the SyFy television series &quot;Haven&quot;, inspired by the Hard Case Crime novel &quot;The Colorado Kid&quot; by Stephen King. The pilot episode of &quot;Haven&quot; premiered on July 9, 2010 and the series finale premiered on December 17, 2015.

In 2015, he received the Ellery Queen Award for his work on Hard Case Crime.

In 2016, he wrote a novel based on the Shane Black movie &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;.

On September 22, 2021, Titan Comics released under the Hard Case Crime imprint &quot;Gun Honey&quot; #1, Ardai&#x27;s first written work for the comics medium. The book, which is drawn by Ang Hor Kheng, and features covers by Bill Sienkiewicz, Robert McGinnis, and Adam Hughes, centers upon weapons smuggler Joanna Tan, who after helping a convict escape prison, is chosen by the U.S. government to track him down and return him. The four-issue miniseries was conceived by Ardai when he conceived of Hard Case Crime Comics five years prior, and he has likened &quot;Gun Honey&quot; to other espionage action thrillers that influenced it, such as James Bond, as well as action/adventure stories featuring female protagonists, such as Modesty Blaise, &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and &quot;Barbarella&quot;. At the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, the debut issue has a rating of 8 out of 10, based on eight critics&#x27; reviews. The story was followed by a sequel, &quot;Gun Honey: Blood for Blood&quot;, in which Joanna and her ally, a government agent named Brook Barrow, are framed for murder by a vengeful rival of Joanna&#x27;s. That miniseries premiered August 24, 2022. It was followed by a four-issue spinoff series, &quot;Heat Seeker: A Gun Honey Series&quot;, also written by Ardai, with art by Ace Continuado, Jose Zapata, and Asifur Rahman. The book, whose debut issue was released on June 28, 2023, sees Tan going on the run after she is targeted for assassination by the U.S. government. Pursued by a beautiful sociopathic hitwoman named Sarah Claride, Tan seeks help from her friend, stage magician and illusionist Dahlia Racers, who specializes in helping people disappear. The next installment in the series was the miniseries &quot;Gun Honey: Collision Course&quot;, whose debut issue was released May 15, 2024.

<text>Kiten is a Japanese Kanji learning tool and reference for the KDE Software Compilation, specifically, in the kdeedu package. It also works as a Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese dictionary. The user can input words into a search box, and all related Kanji are returned with their meaning and part of speech. Kanji can be filtered by rarity and part of speech. A list of Kanji is also available which sorts characters by grade level and stroke number. Selecting one shows its Onyomi, Kunyomi, and meanings. Users can also add Kanji to their &quot;learn list&quot; and get simple flashcard quizzes where the Kanji is displayed along with possible meanings to choose from.

The program was available only for Linux operating systems, but with the beta release of KDE for Windows, it is now available on Microsoft Windows.
