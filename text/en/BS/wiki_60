<text>Clopin Trouillefou (, literally &quot;Lame Fear-Fool&quot;) is a fictional character first created in the 1831 novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; by French author Victor Hugo, and subsequently adapted.

==In the novel==
In the story, Clopin disrupts Pierre Gringoire&#x27;s play, begging the audience for money. Later that night, Gringoire runs into him once again in the Court of Miracles, where Clopin is revealed not as a beggar, but as the King of Truands (the criminals and outcasts of Paris). He prepares to execute Gringoire for trespassing, until the beautiful Esmeralda agrees to marry him in order to save him. He is revealed to be a friend of Esmeralda&#x27;s guardian, the Duke of Egypt, who is also one of the authority figures in his court.
Near the end of the novel, Clopin receives news of Esmeralda&#x27;s upcoming execution for the framed murder of Captain Phoebus. In order to rescue her, he rounds all of the Truands to attack Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral where Esmeralda is protected by Quasimodo. In response to the assault, Quasimodo retaliates with stones, timber, and molten lead. Finally, the author notes that Clopin dies courageously during the attack.

==Adaptations==
Among the actors who have played Clopin over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:
==Disney version==

Clopin is also present in Disney&#x27;s 1996 animated film adaptation of the story, in which he is more jovial and less sinister than in the novel. However, he is much darker, in clothing and humor, when Quasimodo and Captain Phoebus arrive in the Court of Miracles, suggesting his personality during the day to have been something of a façade. On the other hand, he is shown to have a gentle nature at the end of the film when he picks a little girl up and entertains her with a puppet resembling Judge Claude Frollo. Clopin&#x27;s ending pitch of the song &quot;The Bells of Notre Dame&quot; has garnered incredible acclaim for its high D-note singing. He is voiced by Paul Kandel and animated by Michael Surrey. While he is mainly based on Clopin from the book, he is also similar to Pierre Gringoire from the book, having a similar physical appearance and being dressed like a jester (in the book, after joining the Romani, Pierre dresses like a fool when performing.)

As well as narrating the whole film, Clopin introduces the film and begins the story with the song &quot;The Bells of Notre Dame,&quot; where he introduces the audience to the story by explaining how Quasimodo, the bell ringer from Notre Dame, ended up there. He also sings &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot; about the traditional Parisian &quot;Feast of Fools,&quot; also known as Twelfth Night held every year on January 6.

Clopin wears two main costumes during the film: a jester suit (seen above), which he wears at the Festival of Fools; he also wears a similar costume in the catacombs, but it is almost completely purple with no gold trim, no mask, and no bells. During the song &quot;The Court of Miracles,&quot; he also wears a lawyer&#x27;s outfit, a judge&#x27;s outfit (resembling Frollo&#x27;s), and an executioner&#x27;s outfit in quick succession.

As the movie&#x27;s narrator, Clopin has a great deal of knowledge about Quasimodo&#x27;s past, seemingly more than Quasimodo himself. This suggests that to know the whole story, throughout Paris he must have many contacts. Clopin&#x27;s age is never estimated, so it is unknown if he was a child or at least old enough to hear about the murder of Quasimodo&#x27;s mother.

Not only is Clopin the narrator in the story, but he is also the King of the Roma, who at the time were being rounded up and murdered in an act of &quot;purification&quot; by Frollo.

===Original film===
Clopin appears in the film five times. The first appearance is when Clopin sings &quot;The Bells of Notre Dame,&quot; which tells the tale of how Frollo killed Quasimodo&#x27;s mother, but was stopped by the Archdeacon before he could kill the infant Quasimodo by drowning him in a well.

The second appearance is at the Festival of Fools, where he acts as the Lord of Misrule, or master of ceremonies, sings &quot;Topsy Turvy,&quot; a dance number that explains that it is &quot;the day we do the things that we deplore on the other three-hundred-and-sixty-four.&quot; It is also during this song that he crowns Quasimodo the &quot;King of Fools.&quot;

His third appearance is much later in the film, at the Court of Miracles, where a much darker side to his personality is shown. He and a large group of gypsies believe Quasimodo and Phoebus to be spies. They sing the song &quot;The Court of Miracles&quot; as Clopin puts Quasimodo and Phoebus on &quot;trial&quot; which includes a jury consisting of a puppet crafted in Clopin&#x27;s likeness. He eventually finds them &quot;totally innocent, which is the worst crime of all.&quot; He prepares to hang them, but Esmeralda arrives in time to stop him and tell the Romani of their good intentions, explaining how Phoebus rescued the miller and his family from being burned by Frollo and how Quasimodo helped her escape the cathedral. Clopin humorously asks why they didn&#x27;t just say so. Phoebus informs the Roma people to leave, saying that Frollo knows of their hideout, a statement confirmed by Quasimodo, who was told of this by Frollo before. Realizing this, all the Travellers (including Clopin) agree and prepare to leave Paris, but unfortunately, Frollo arrives just in time to attack the Court of Miracles and Clopin is seen with his people struggling to break free from their bonds to no avail.

His fourth appearance is briefly during the climax of the film where Esmeralda is at the scaffold before Notre Dame. When Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda, Phoebus breaks free and rouses the civilians into action, inciting them to release the Roma and help them protect the cathedral from Frollo&#x27;s soldiers. Clopin is seen jumping out of one of the many cages that hold the Romani freed by the civilians. Along with the civilians and French army, they attack Frollo&#x27;s soldiers.

His fifth and final appearance is at the end, where Quasimodo is escorted out from the cathedral to be praised by the people for his actions. Having developed a newfound respect for Quasimodo, Clopin happily declares &quot;Three cheers for Quasimodo!&quot; He then sings a reprise of &quot;The Bells of Notre Dame&quot; while entertaining one of the young children as the civilians finally cheer Quasimodo, accepting him into their society.

===Sequel===
Clopin also appeared in the straight-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot;, as the host for the Festival of Love (Le Jour D&#x27;Amour, &quot;the day of love&quot;), although he is no longer the narrator and plays a much smaller role.

=== Stage Musical ===
Disney&#x27;s &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; musical premiered on American stages at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California on October 28, 2014 and ran until December 7, 2014. It was followed by a run at Paper Mill Playhouse, which opened on March 4, 2015 in Millburn, New Jersey. Clopin was &quot;perfectly portrayed&quot; by Erik Liberman, who also performed the role on the Original Cast Recording.

==Park appearances==
The Disney version of Clopin is a rare meetable character at the Disney Parks and Resorts, but can be seen as a figure inside Clopin’s Music Box in Fantasyland.

<text>Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania (LHU) is a public university in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. The main campus covers and the branch campus covers . It offers 69 undergraduate programs and 4 graduate programs.

==History==
LHU was founded in 1870 as the Central State Normal School. By 1927 it was known as the State Teachers College in Lock Haven and in 1960 the name was changed to Lock Haven State College. In 1983, the school joined the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and became known as Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. The Clearfield campus in Clearfield, Pennsylvania was established in 1989.

LHU&#x27;s previous president Craig Dean Willis retired from Lock Haven in 2004. The vacancy left by Willis was promptly filled by Keith T. Miller. Upon Miller&#x27;s departure, Barbara Dixon, former president of Truman State University was appointed Interim President in 2010. In 2011, Michael Fiorentino, Jr. became the president, until his retirement in 2018. The current president of Lock Haven University is Robert Pignatello.

In July 2021, Pennsylvania higher education officials announced that Lock Haven would merge with Bloomsburg and Mansfield Universities in response to financial difficulties and declining enrollment, and each institution would represent a campus of a single university. In March 2022, the new institution was created to oversee the three universities, and was named the Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania. This consolidation was different from the PASSHE consolidation in Western Pennsylvania that also took place in July 2022, which saw the former California, Clarion, and Edinboro universities become campuses of the new Pennsylvania Western University and adopt the academic brand name of &quot;PennWest &quot;Location&quot;&quot;. By contrast, &quot;Commonwealth University&quot; is not being used as a public-facing brand.

In January 2025, Commonwealth University announced that the Clearfield campus would close by the end of the 202627 academic year.

==Campus==
The campus covers on the western side of the city of Lock Haven. The university owns another at the LHU Clearfield Campus and at the Sieg Conference Center. University property also includes a new East Campus in the former Lock Haven High School building.

===Residence halls===
LHU has five traditional residence halls, one hall of suites and one apartment building. * = Halls that are scheduled to be demolished.

===Academic buildings===

Akeley Hall, completed in 1930, is one of the oldest buildings on campus. It was originally constructed as a laboratory school but now houses the Computer Science, Accounting and Management Department as well as many computer labs.

Sullivan Hall was originally constructed as a library in 1938, and was demolished in 2016 and replaced with an amphitheater. The three-story structure housed The Office of the President, Offices for the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost, Vice President of Student Affairs, and the Vice President for Finance, Administration, and Technology, Housing, Social Equity, Cultural Diversity, Institutional Research, and Planning and Assessment and
The Linda J. Emanuel Teaching and Learning Center.

The main building of Ulmer Hall, renovated in 1996, was constructed in 1952 and contains laboratories for the natural and earth sciences and classrooms. A building addition in 1969 added a greenhouse, planetarium, additional classrooms, laboratories and research facilities. A four-million dollar renovation was completed in 2014 to transfer many services to the building such as the ROTC program, the Registrar&#x27;s Office and Financial Aid, as well as Counseling Services. Ulmer Hall also houses the executive suite which includes the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, and the Office of the Vice President for Enrollment Management.

Russell Hall was originally constructed as a residence hall and was the last single-sex residence hall on campus, housing women only until it was renovated to house administrative offices. It has been recently demolished and replaced by a green space which is part of the University Commons encompassing the space that previously also included Sullivan Hall. Raub Hall was completed in 1964.

Sloan Fine Arts Center, completed in 1973, contains classrooms, faculty offices, both a small and large theatre for student and professional performances and lectures, and a gallery which hosts six exhibitions throughout the year. The Departments of Fine Arts, the Department of communications, and Performing Arts are located here. The theatre hosts a number of performances that are open to both the student body and community. Room 321 is home to the Countdown Theater. Here student directed one-act plays and other short performances expand the role of the theater department and provide students with additional learning experiences.

Robinson Hall, completed in 1981. This building houses the Departments of Early Childhood, Elementary, Secondary and Special Education, Psychology, Mathematics, Communications Media and Philosophy. Other features include the Hamblin International Hall of Flags Auditorium, a full production television studio and radio station, a Math Lab and tutoring center devoted to remediation and placement testing, and classrooms. The building also provides housing for the information technology services, including a student-run tech department. The building is scheduled to undergo a major renovation in 2021 following a comprehensive review of facilities usage.

Durrwachter Alumni Conference Center, completed in 2007, houses the Offices of Admissions, University Relations and Alumni Relations. The Foundation offices are also located in the Durrwachter Center. This area coordinates and manages philanthropic activities that support the university. Alumni Relations provides programs and services for over 30,000 graduates.

====East Campus and the Science Center====
In 2004 Lock Haven acquired the old Lock Haven High School, which was no longer used due to the creation of Central Mountain High School. This consisted of the junior high school, senior high school, and the gym building. In April 2010, Lock Haven unveiled its plans to build a 40 million dollar new science center where the old senior high school was located. In October 2010, Governor Rendell signed a bill that gave 4 million dollars in funding. Official groundbreaking did not occur until May 4, 2012, this marked the beginning of demolition of the senior high school and construction of the science center. The new science center officially opened for the Fall 2013 semester. It has expanded labs for all science majors other than computer science, and includes a new class 100000 clean room facility for the rapidly expanded Nanotechnology program, allowing the university to rely less on Penn State&#x27;s clean rooms. Nanotechnology research facilities include characterization and synthesis instrumentation. The ribbon cutting ceremony took place on September 12, 2013, and a cornerstone capsule was opened which contained a list of the senior high school staff, the graduates, and a newspaper from 1928. The previous Junior High School section of the facility now houses the Office of the Chief Operating Officer and Senior VP for Finance and Administration, as well as the University Controller&#x27;s office, the Human Resources office, the LHU Small Business Development Center, the Office of Workforce Development and Testing Center, the Criminal Justice academic department, and several classrooms. The previous gymnasium building houses several classrooms, the Nanobites dining facility, and a large gymnasium used for athletic practices and special events. Plans exist for the gymnasium and supporting space within the building to be constructed into a Wrestling Center showcasing the strong Division I wrestling program, and a $1 million redevelopment capital grant has been approved by the Pennsylvania Governor&#x27;s office to support that effort.

===Stevenson Library===
Lock Haven University and its library began in 1870 as the Central State Normal School. All classrooms, dormitories, the dining room, the library, and the auxiliary rooms were housed in the original Sullivan Hall, located approximately where North Hall stands. During the night of December 9, 1888, the entire structure burned to the ground. For the next 16 years, the library needs were met by reading rooms provided by two campus literary societies, The Price Literary Society and the Shakespeare Society.
In 1904, the library was reorganized. Caroline R. Flickinger was the first librarian. Since that time there has been a steady growth in the number and type of library materials and services. This growth has taken the library through two previous buildings into this structure. The present building was designed to be flexible enough to provide for current needs and to allow future development. Currently, an online public access catalog and an automated circulation system are in place. This online catalog is available on the campus network.

The library is named for a citizen of Lock Haven, George B. Stevenson (1889–1965). He served for many years as a Pennsylvania State Senator. After he retired, he was appointed the librarian of the state senate. Stevenson also served as a mayor of Lock Haven, as postmaster, and as a trustee of the university. The system of dams on the West Branch valley of the Susquehanna River was a concept of Senator Stevenson.
Stevenson Library is the university&#x27;s library. Its archive collection includes every student newspaper (&quot;The Eagle Eye&quot;) since 1965, as well as every yearbook (&quot;The Praeco&quot;) since 1913 until it was discontinued in 1980; and was reinstated in 2006. The archive collection also provides the university with rare books and photographs. The library offers internet database services that gives the university access to full text magazine and newspaper articles, DVDs, books, and an array of information. The Children&#x27;s Library on the ground floor of the building contains over 20,000 children&#x27;s books. Stevenson also offers reference services, wireless internet, computer access, and a 24-hour study lounge.

===Fredericks Family Memorial Carillon===

The Fredericks Family Memorial Carillon was designed and completed by the van Bergen Company, which specializes in bells, in 2000. The grand carillon is one of fewer than 200 grand carillons in North America. It weighs more than and can be played manually or by an automatic system that can produce 500 songs from memory. The bells were cast in the Fonderie Paccard.

Lock Haven University&#x27;s radio station is WLHU. An online radio station, which streams live on the internet, is located in the same facility as its new and improved television studio, allowing easy access between the two stations. WLHU has a free format program schedule using a studio which broadcasts daily, as well as broadcasting many sporting events and other programs throughout the school year. Students have the ability to join the school&#x27;s radio club and create their own radio station broadcast.

Lock Haven University&#x27;s student-operated television station, The Havenscope, LHUTV broadcasts news, sports, and other programs. Its studio occupies next to WLHU, Lock Haven University&#x27;s radio station. The television studio is wholly digital and has a teleprompter system, two editing bays, and field production equipment. It includes two backdrops, one for news broadcasts and one for interviews. The studio is on the sixth floor of Robinson Hall and is equipped with a green screen, at least three main broadcast cameras, an integrated TriCaster 8000 production system for audio and video production, several broadcast monitors, a roll-in system, and many other broadcast systems. The studio usually airs at least one show a week called &quot;LHU in Review&quot; hosted by LHU students which covers news, sports and other topics. In the late 1980s students began airing a short morning news segment called &quot;The Morning Alarm&quot; that ran at the top of the hour.

<text>The Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 is a British single-engine tractor two-seat biplane, designed and developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory. Most of the roughly 3,500 built were constructed under contract by private companies, including established aircraft manufacturers and firms new to aircraft construction.

Early versions entered squadron service with the Royal Flying Corps in 1912 and the type served throughout the First World War. Initially used as a reconnaissance aircraft and light bomber, as a single-seat night fighter the type destroyed six German airships between September and December 1916.

By late 1915, the B.E.2 was proving to be vulnerable to the recently introduced German Fokker &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighters, leading to increased losses during the period known as the Fokker Scourge. Although by now obsolete, it had to remain in front line service while replacement types were brought into service. Following its belated withdrawal from combat, the B.E. continued to serve in training, communications, and coastal anti-submarine patrol roles.

The B.E.2 became the subject of controversy. From the B.E.2c variant onward, it had been developed to be inherently stable, which was helpful for artillery observation and aerial photography duties. However this stability was achieved at the expense of manoeuvrability; moreover the observer, in the front seat ahead of the pilot, had a limited field of fire for his gun.

==Development==
===Background===
The B.E.2 was one of the first fixed-wing aircraft to be designed at what was then called the Royal Balloon Factory (the organisation was formally renamed as the &quot;Royal Aircraft Factory&quot; on 26 April 1911). The team responsible for its design came under the direction of British engineer Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman, the factory&#x27;s superintendent. The &quot;B.E.2&quot; designation was formulated in accordance with the system devised by O&#x27;Gorman, which classified aircraft by their layout: B.E. stood for &quot;Blériot Experimental&quot;, and was used for aircraft of tractor configuration (although in practice, all B.E. types were biplanes rather than the monoplanes typical of the Blériot company).

At first, the activities of the Factory were limited to aeronautical research and the design and construction of actual aircraft was not officially sanctioned. O&#x27;Gorman got around this restriction by using the factory&#x27;s responsibility for the repair and maintenance of aircraft belonging to the Royal Flying Corps, so that existing aircraft needing major repairs were nominally &quot;reconstructed&quot; but often appeared as new designs, retaining few original components aside from the engine.

The first pair of B.E. aircraft were flown within two months of each other and had the same basic design, the work of Geoffrey de Havilland, who was at the time both the chief designer and the test pilot at the Balloon Factory. Its first public appearance was in early January 1912. With the contemporary Avro 500, the B.E.2 helped to establish the tractor biplane as the dominant aircraft layout for a considerable time.

===B.E.1===

This was ostensibly a rebuild of a Voisin pusher biplane, powered by a water-cooled Wolseley engine; however, the B.E.1 used only the powerplant of the Voisin.

It was a two-bay tractor biplane with parallel-chord unstaggered wings with rounded ends and used wing warping for roll control. The wings were of unequal span with the upper wing&#x27;s span being and the lower . The fuselage was a rectangular section fabric-covered wire-braced structure, with the pilot seated aft behind the wings, and the observer in front under the centre section. This arrangement allowed the aircraft to be flown &quot;solo&quot; without affecting the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity. Behind the pilot&#x27;s position, a curved top decking extended aft to the tail, although the forward decking and cowling of later variants was not fitted at this stage. The tail surfaces consisted of a half-oval horizontal stabiliser with a split elevator mounted on top of the upper longerons and an ovoid rudder hinged to the sternpost. There was no fixed vertical fin. The main undercarriage consisted of a pair of skids each carried on an inverted V-strut at their rear and a single raked strut at the front while an axle carrying the wheels was bound to the skids by bungee cords and restrained by radius rods. A similarly sprung tailskid was fitted, while the wings were protected by semicircular bows located beneath the lower wing tips. The radiator being mounted between the front pair of cabane struts

It was first flown by de Havilland on 4 December 1911. but was not flown again until 27 December, following the substitution of a Claudel carburettor for the original Wolseley, which had allowed no throttle control. Other minor modifications were made over the following weeks: the undercarriage wheels were moved back , the wings (which originally had no dihedral), were re-rigged to have 1° dihedral, and the propeller was cut down in an attempt to increase the engine speed. Later, the Wolseley engine was replaced by a air-cooled Renault which eliminated the need for a radiator.

The B.E.1 had a long career as a research aircraft: trialling many of the modifications made to later B.E.2 variants. By the time it was finally struck off charge in 1916 it resembled a contemporary B.E.2b. Among other equipment tested for the first time in this airframe was early radio apparatus.

===B.E.2===
The B.E.2 was almost identical to the B.E.1, differing principally in being powered by a air-cooled V-8 Renault and in having equal-span wings. Its number was not allocated as a separate type, but numbers allocated to early Royal Aircraft Factory aircraft were the constructor&#x27;s numbers rather than type designations. Sometimes described as a &quot;rebuild&quot; of either a Bristol Boxkite or a Breguet, it seems to have been the first aeroplane built at the factory without the subterfuge of being a &quot;reconstruction&quot;. It first flew on 1 February 1912, again with de Havilland as the test pilot. The Renault proved a much more satisfactory powerplant than the Wolseley fitted to the B.E.1, and performance was further improved when a model was fitted that May.

The B.E.2 flew extensively at the Military Aeroplane Competition on Salisbury Plain during August 1912. It was barred from competing officially as O&#x27;Gorman was one of the judges, but its performance was clearly superior to the other entrants and on 12 August 1912 it achieved a British altitude record of while being flown by de Havilland with Major Sykes as a passenger.

Other prototypes of the production B.E.2 series were produced, including the &quot;B.E.5&quot; and the &quot;B.E.6&quot;. These mainly differed in the powerplant, initially an ENV liquid cooled engine, and both were eventually fitted with Renaults, becoming effectively standard B.E.2.s

===B.E.2a===

The designation B.E.2a was assigned to the first production aircraft having first appeared on a drawing showing an aircraft with unequal span wings with slight dihedral dated 20 February 1912. These differed from the B.E.1 and B.E.2 in possessing a revised fuel system, in which the streamlined gravity tank below the centre section of the wing was moved to behind the engine although the main fuel tank remained under the observer&#x27;s seat.
Early production aircraft had unequal span wings, similar to those fitted on the B.E.1, and at first there was no decking between the pilot and observer&#x27;s seats, although this was added later. Sandbag loading tests revealed that the safety margin of the rear spar was somewhat less than that of the front; to remedy this, a revised wing was designed with a deeper rear spar, and consequently a different aerofoil section. Later production aircraft also had equal-span wings. These modifications were retrofitted to the majority of the remaining earlier production aircraft.

The first production order was placed with British manufacturing conglomerate Vickers; shortly afterwards a second order was issued to the Bristol Aeroplane Company. The first contractor-built B.E.2as appeared during the first weeks of 1913; during February of that year, at least two such aeroplanes were delivered to No.2 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. These were possibly the first examples of the type to enter service.

===B.E.2b===
The B.E.2b which followed the original production standard benefitted from various improvements. It had a revised cockpit coamings, which gave better protection from the elements, and revised controls to both the elevator and rudder. Some aircraft ordered as B.E.2bs were completed as B.E.2cs, and others were built with some of the B.E.2c modifications, such as sump cowlings and &quot;V&quot; undercarriages.

At the outbreak of war, these early B.E.2s formed part of the equipment of the first three squadrons of the RFC to be sent to France. A B.E.2a of No.2 Squadron was the first aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps to arrive in France after the start of the First World War, on 26 August 1914.

===B.E.2c===

The B.E.2c was a major redesign, and was the result of research by E.T. Busk which aimed to provide an inherently stable aeroplane. This allowed the crew&#x27;s full attention to be devoted to reconnaissance duties and was also desirable for safety reasons. The first example, a converted B.E.2b, flew on 30 May 1914 and the type went into squadron service just before the outbreak of war. Relatively large orders were placed for the new version, with deliveries of production aircraft starting in December 1914. During 1915, this model replaced the early B.E.2s in the squadrons in France. The B.E.2c used the same fuselage as the B.E.2b, but was otherwise really a new type, being fitted with new staggered wings of different planform, while ailerons replaced the wing warping used on earlier models. The tailplane was also new, and a triangular fin was fitted to the rudder.
After the first few aircraft, production machines were powered by a development of the Renault engine, the RAF 1a, and the twin skid undercarriage was replaced by a plain &quot;V&quot; undercarriage. A streamlined cowling covering the sump was fitted to improve streamlining. Exhausts were also modified with two vertical exhaust pipes (one for each cylinder bank) discharging above the upper wing.

===B.E.2d===
The B.E.2d was a dual control version of the &quot;c&quot; variant and was provided with full controls in the front cockpit as well as in the rear.
This meant that there was no room for the fuel tank under the observer&#x27;s seat; instead a centre section gravity tank was fitted. To ensure adequate endurance this tank was large, adding drag that reduced performance, particularly in the climb. Most B.E.2ds were used as trainers, where their dual controls and five-hour endurance were of benefit.

B.E.2ds supplied to Belgium were not only re-engined with Hispano engines, but at least some of them had the pilot and observer&#x27;s seating positions reversed, giving the latter a much better field of fire. Some Belgian B.E.2cs were similarly modified, and at least one was fitted with a Scarff ring on the rear cockpit.

===B.E.2e===

During 1916, the B.E.2cs began to be superseded by the B.E.2e. This variant had new sesquiplane wings, similar to those used on the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, which were braced by a single pair of interplane struts per side as a &quot;single-bay&quot; biplane, and with the lower wing panels having a much reduced span. Ailerons were fitted to upper and lower wings and were joined by connecting rods. The horizontal tail was also new, replacing the semicircular unit of the B.E.2c and d with an angular unit with straight leading and trailing edges and angled tips, while the large curved fin and the rudder of the late B.E.2c was retained.

It was intended to fit the new, uprated RAF 1b but this engine did not achieve production status, and the B.E.2e used the same engine as its predecessor, considerably reducing the expected improvement in performance.

B.E.2c and B.E.2d aircraft still under construction when the new model entered production were completed with B.E.2e wings. To rationalise the supply of spare parts these aircraft were officially designated as the &quot;B.E.2f&quot; and &quot;B.E.2g&quot;.

About 3,500 B.E.2s were built by over 20 different manufacturers. An exact breakdown between the different models has never been produced, if only because so many B.E.2s were completed as later models than originally ordered.

The &quot;B.E.9&quot; and the &quot;B.E.12&quot; were variants developed to provide the B.E.2 with an effective forward-firing armament. The B.E.12 (a single-seater) went into production and saw squadron service, mainly as a Zeppelin interceptor, however neither variant was ultimately a great success as both designs had been superseded by the time they were completed.

==Operational history==
===Prewar service===
During the pre-war period, those B.E.2s that had reached service were primarily flown by No 2, No 4 and No 6 Squadrons, who rapidly accumulated an unusually high number of flight hours on the type. Aviation author J.M. Bruce has commented that during this time, compared with their contemporaries, the early B.E.2s demonstrated a high standard of serviceability and reliability: as borne out by the squadrons&#x27; maintenance records.

During this time, multiple long-distance flights were conducted using individual B.E.2s, especially by personnel of No. 2. Squadron. On 22 May 1913, Captain Longcroft flew his aircraft from Farnborough Airport to Montrose Aerodrome, covering the 550 mile distance in ten hours, 55 minutes, with two intermediary stops. On 19 August 1913, Longcroft repeated this trip using a B.E.2 outfitted with an additional fuel tank, lowering the journey time to seven hours, 40 minutes with only one stop midway. A good deal of experimental flying was undertaken during this period, influencing later fuel system and undercarriage design as well as structural strengthening and aerodynamic changes.

===Western Front===

The early models of the B.E. 2 had already served in the RFC for two years prior to the outbreak of the Great War, and were among the aircraft that arrived with the British Expeditionary Force in France during 1914. Like all service aircraft of this period, they had been designed at a time when the qualities required by a warplane were largely a matter for conjecture and speculation, in the absence of any actual experience of the use of aircraft in warfare: at this stage all the combatants were still feeling their way and aerial combat, especially the need for reconnaissance aircraft to be able to defend themselves, was not widely anticipated. As a result, the B.E.2 was originally designed without any provision for armament.

In the absence of any official policy regarding armament, more aggressive crews improvised their own. While some flew entirely unarmed, or perhaps carried service revolvers or automatic pistols, others armed themselves with hand-wielded rifles or carbines as used by ground troops, or even fitted a Lewis gun. The performance of the early Renault powered models of the B.E. was degraded by any additional weight, and in any case the carriage of this weaponry proved of questionable effectiveness.

It was still necessary for the observer to be located over the centre of gravity, in front of the pilot, to ensure fore and aft balance when the aircraft was flown &quot;solo&quot;. In this awkward position, his view was poor, and the degree to which he could handle a camera (or, later, a gun) was hampered by the struts and wires supporting the centre section of the top wing. In practice, the pilot of a B.E.2 almost always operated the camera, and the observer, when he was armed at all, had a rather poor field of fire to the rear, having, at best, to shoot back over his pilot&#x27;s head. Whenever bombs were to be carried, or maximum endurance was required, the observer would normally have to be left behind.

Nonetheless, the B.E.2s were already in use as light bombers as well as for visual reconnaissance; an attack on Courtrai Railway station on 26 April 1915 earning a posthumous Victoria Cross for 2nd Lt. William Rhodes-Moorhouse, the first such award to be made for an aerial operation. By this time, prewar aircraft were already disappearing from RFC service.

The type that replaced the B.E.2a and B.E.2b (as well as the assortment of other types in use at the time) in the reconnaissance squadrons of the RFC in 1915 was the B.E.2c, which had also been designed before the war. The most important difference in the new model was an improvement in stability – a genuinely useful characteristic, especially in aerial photographic work, using the primitive plate cameras of the time, with their relatively long exposures. Unfortunately, in this case the stability was coupled with &quot;heavy&quot; controls and relatively poor manoeuvrability. A suitable engine was not available in sufficient quantities to replace the air-cooled Renault – the RAF 1a being essentially an uprated version of the French engine – so that the improvement in the B.E.2c&#x27;s performance was less than startling.

The vulnerability of the B.E.2c to fighter attack became plain in late 1915, with the advent of the Fokker &quot;Eindecker&quot;. This led the British press to disparagingly refer to the aircraft as being &quot;Fokker Fodder&quot;, while German pilots also gave it the nickname of &quot;kaltes Fleisch&quot; (&quot;cold meat&quot;). British ace Albert Ball described the B.E.2c as &quot;a bloody awful aeroplane&quot;. Unable to cope with such a primitive fighter as the Fokker E.I, it was virtually helpless against the newer German fighters of 1916–17. The aircraft&#x27;s poor performance against the Fokker and the failure to improve the aircraft or replace it caused great controversy in England, with Noel Pemberton Billing attacking the B.E.2c and the Royal Aircraft Factory in the House of Commons on 21 March 1916, claiming that RFC pilots in France were being &quot;rather murdered than killed&quot;.

This agitation prompted the setting up of two enquiries; one into the management of the Royal Aircraft Factory, and another into the high command of the Royal Flying Corps, the latter of which being headed by a judge. These reports largely cleared both Factory management and the RFC commanders responsible for ordering the B.E.2, but Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman was effectively dismissed as supervisor of the Factory by a &quot;sideways promotion&quot;, while many of the most talented individuals amongst the factory&#x27;s designers and engineers followed de Havilland into private industry.

Once the threat from the Fokker monoplanes had been effectively contained by the introduction of a new generation of Allied fighters, such as the Airco D.H.2 and Nieuport 11, the rate of B.E.2c losses over the Western Front dropped to an acceptable level; official records indicate that during the second quarter of 1916, the B.E.2 actually had the lowest loss rates of all the major types then in use by the service. Encouraged by this, the RFC took delivery of large numbers of the BE.2e, which promised improved performance, and combined the stability of the B.E.2c with rather &quot;lighter&quot; controls (which held the promise of better manoeuvrability).

By the spring of 1917, however, conditions on the Western Front had changed again; the German fighter squadrons having been re-equipped with better fighters, especially the Albatros D.III. It had been planned that by this time B.E.2s in front-line service would have been replaced by newer aircraft, such as the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 and Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8, but delivery of these types was initially slower than hoped. This situation culminated in what became known as &quot;Bloody April&quot;, with the RFC losing 60 B.E.2s during that month.

An incident illustrating both the poor level of piloting skills with which new RFC pilots were sent to France in 1917 and the level of popularity of the B.E.2e on the Western Front at that time is recorded by Arthur Gould Lee, then a young RFC novice, in his book &quot;No Parachute&quot;. On 19 May 1917, six pilots, newly arrived in France and still to be allocated to a squadron, were each given a new B.E.2e to ferry between RFC depots at St Omer and Candas. One crashed in transit, three crashed on landing and one went missing (the pilot was killed). Lee, the pilot of the only aircraft to arrive safely, wrote in a letter to his wife:

:&quot;I felt rather a cad not crashing too because everyone is glad to see death-traps like Quirks written off, especially new ones.&quot;

Fortunately, by this time, the B.E.2e was already being rapidly replaced on the Western Front by later types, but this was from several points of view more than a year too late.

===Night fighter===
As early as 1915, the B.E.2c entered service as a pioneer night fighter, being used in attempts to intercept and destroy the German airship raiders. The interceptor version of the B.E.2c was flown as a single-seater, outfitted with an auxiliary fuel tank on the centre of gravity in the position of the observer&#x27;s seat.

Among other projected weapons intended to attack airships from above, including Ranken darts and small incendiary bombs, was the &quot;Fiery Grapnel&quot;. Developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory, the grapnel consisted of a two-inch long hollow steel shaft packed with an explosive charge and fitted with a sharp four-sided nose and metal plates that acted as fins; this would have been attached to a winch-mounted cable and carried by a single B.E.2. It was intended for the fighter to approach a Zeppelin from above, after which the grapnel would be dropped and appropriate manoeuvring employed to strike the surface of the Zeppelin with it: it then would bury itself and explode, causing ignition of the airship&#x27;s hydrogen gas.

A simpler and much more practical solution proved to be to attack from below, using a Lewis gun firing a mixture of explosive and incendiary ammunition at an upwards angle of 45°.

The new tactic proved to be highly effective. On the night of 2–3 September 1916, a single B.E.2c was credited with the downing of SL 11, the first German airship to be shot down over Britain after over a year of night raids. This feat led to the pilot, Captain William Leefe Robinson, being awarded a Victoria Cross and various cash prizes, totalling up to £3,500, that had been put up by a number of individuals.

This was not an isolated victory; five more German airships were destroyed by Home Defence B.E.2c interceptors between October and December 1916. As a consequence of these losses, the German Army&#x27;s airship fleet ceased raids over England: German naval airship raiders of 1917 flew at higher altitudes to avoid interception, reducing their effectiveness. Daylight raids by heavier-than-air bombers were also planned.

The performance of the B.E.2 was inadequate to intercept airships flying at 15,000 feet much less the Gotha bombers that emerged during 1917, and its career as an effective home defence fighter was over.

===Other fronts===
While the majority of operational B.E.2s served on the Western Front, the type also saw limited use in other overseas theatres. At least one pair of B.E.2s were among the aircraft dispatched with No 3 Squadron for use in the Gallipoli Campaign. They were used to spot in support of naval bombardments, as well as being occasionally used to directly bomb ships and other targets.

As early as 1914, some B.E.2as went to Australia, where they served as trainer aircraft for the nascent Australian Flying Corps at Point Cook, Victoria. In a similar fashion, the type also was adopted at the Indian Flying School at Sitapur. At least one B.E.2 was dispatched to Egypt to reinforce friendly forces fighting in the Eastern Mediterranean; on 16 April 1915, this aircraft participated in the bombing of El Murra.

A BE2e was lost in aerial combat over Salonika on 3 October 1917: the British pilot and observer were both killed and were buried by &quot;The Bulgurs&quot; with full military honours. Both were reinterred in Struma military cemetery.

===Airship gondola===

A number of B.E.2 fuselages were employed as makeshift gondolas for the hastily designed SS class &quot;blimps&quot;, which were introduced into service by the Royal Naval Air Service for anti-submarine duties during March 1915. Later classes featured purpose-built gondolas.

===Non-combat use===
From 1917 onwards, the B.E.2 was generally withdrawn from both the front line and night fighter use. The surviving examples continued in use for submarine spotting and as trainers throughout the rest of the conflict. In spite of the type&#x27;s rather unresponsive controls, it was capable of executing comprehensive (if somewhat stately) aerobatics, and was by no means a bad trainer.

On 19 February 1917, a B.E.2c was used to conduct the British Army&#x27;s first aeromedical evacuation when it flew out the sole casualty of the raid on Bir el Hassana in the Sinai Peninsula. The man had a shattered ankle, and the 45-minute flight in the observer&#x27;s seat spared him an agonizing multi-day journey by camel.

===Post-war use===
A B.E.2e was used to conduct the first flight across Australia, flying from Melbourne to Port Darwin. It was piloted by Captain H. N. Wrigley, accompanied by Sergeant A. W. Murphy. The journey, made between 16 November and 12 December 1919, involved a combined 46 hours of flying time.

Another B.E.2e was one of the first two aircraft (the other was an Avro 504K) owned by the new Australian airline Qantas when it was founded in Queensland in 1920–1921.

==Survivors and reproductions==
Surviving restored aircraft and reproductions are on display at several museums, including the Imperial War Museum, Duxford; the RAF Museum, Hendon; the Canada Aviation Museum, Ottawa; the Musée de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace, Paris; the Militaire Luchtvaartmuseum, Soesterberg, Netherlands; United States Army Aviation Museum and the Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, Norway.
B.E.2f serial A1325 has been restored to airworthiness by The Vintage Aviator Ltd in New Zealand, with an original RAF1A V8 engine, and made its debut at the Classic Fighters Omaka airshow in April 2009. TVAL has also built several airworthy reproductions including c and f models, two of which are currently in the UK on loan to the WW1 Aviation Heritage Trust, and a BE.12.

A flying B.E.2c replica (registered G-AWYI) was built by pilot and engineer Charles Boddington at Sywell, UK in 1969 for use in the film &quot;Biggles Sweeps the Skies&quot;. The production was cancelled, and Boddington was killed the following year in an air crash during filming of the movie &quot;Von Richthofen &amp; Brown&quot;. The B.E.2c itself was badly damaged in a crash in the United States in 1977 but Boddington&#x27;s son Matthew returned it to flying condition in 2011. It flew with the Great War Display Team but was destroyed in an accident on 2 September 2020.

The UK&#x27;s latest non-flying reproduction was completed around 2008 at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, and is now displayed with the Boscombe Down Aviation Collection at Old Sarum.

A B.E.2a (an early variant with unequal span wings) was built from original plans and completed in February 2014. It is on display at the RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, Australia.

Volunteers at Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre, Angus, Scotland have built a full-size replica B.E.2a (No.471) from original plans and it is now on display. It has a precision-made replica Renault 70 hp engine.

The WW1 Aviation Heritage Trust has been operating a TVAL-built BE2e in England since 2014. It resides currently at Stow Maries Great War Aerodrome in Essex.

==Variants summary==
* B.E.1: Prototype – important pioneer tractor biplane. The first B.E.2 was virtually identical, except for the engine originally installed.
**B.E.5: Prototype, officially a rebuild of a Howard Wright biplane, powered by ENV engine, otherwise similar to original B.E.2. First flight 27 June 1912. Rebuilt with Renault engine and effectively became a B.E.2.
**B.E.6: Prototype, officially a rebuild of the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.1. First flown 5 September 1912, powered by a ENV engine like the B.E.5, but refitted with Renault before delivery to RFC later that month, as a B.E.2.
* B.E.2a: Initial production version of B.E.2. Built in small numbers from late 1912 – still a standard type at the outbreak of war in late 1914
* B.E.2b: basically, the same as the &quot;a&quot; with higher sides to the cockpits; late examples (perhaps those completed after the B.E.2c went into production) used ailerons instead of wing warping and featured other &quot;c&quot; characteristics such as &quot;V&quot; undercarriages and engine sump cowlings.
* B.E.2c: extensively redesigned to enhance stability, with a new tailplane and wings.
* B.E.2d: essentially a &quot;c&quot; variant with dual controls, and a larger gravity fuel tank

* B.E.2e: the final version, with new single-bay wings. Expected to be a great improvement on the &quot;c&quot;, it was a major disappointment.
* B.E.2f: B.E.2c with B.E.2e wings.
* B.E.2g: B.E.2d with B.E.2e wings.
* B.E.9: B.E.2c with a wooden box (called a &quot;pulpit&quot;, somewhat like the French SPAD S.A) in front of the propeller for an observer/gunner&#x27;s seat. It remained a prototype only.
* B.E.12: single-seat B.E.2c with a synchronised gun and more powerful engine. The B.E.12a had B.E.2e wings.

<text>The black phantom tetra (Hyphessobrycon megalopterus), or simply phantom tetra, is a small freshwater fish of the characin family (Characidae) of order Characiformes. It is native to the upper Paraguay basin and upper Madeira basin (including Guaporé, Mamore and Beni) in Brazil and Bolivia. It is commonly seen in the aquarium trade.

==Appearance==
This fish is of roughly tetragonal shape, light grey in coloring, with a black patch, surrounded by iridescent silver edging, posterior of the gills on each side. The male&#x27;s fins are black, as is the female&#x27;s dorsal fin; the female&#x27;s pelvic, anal, and 
adipose fins are reddish in color. A long-finned variety, apparently developed by captive breeders, is sometimes sold in the aquarium trade (the male has elongated dorsal and anal fins even in the wild form). The black phantom tetra reaches a maximum standard length of .

=== Sex ===

The male black phantom tetras have longer fins than the females and when in breeding condition, the females become plumper, but the biggest difference is in their color. The males have no red, while the smaller fins of the female both on the top and underneath them are red. The adipose fin, on the top of the body behind the larger dorsal fin, is much more noticeable in the females than the males, because in females it is red while in the males it is grey. The female&#x27;s dorsal fin has a more intense black than the male&#x27;s. When the fish are in breeding condition, the colors of both sexes become more distinct, with the male showing its black fins more obviously.

==Feeding==
The black phantom tetra&#x27;s natural diet consist of small crustaceans, insects, and worms.

==In the aquarium==

&quot;H. megalopterus&quot; is one of the more popular tetras sold in the aquarium trade. While it is not particularly colorful, it makes up for this by its display behavior: the males are territorial and defend their space against their neighbors by presenting themselves in profile with the dorsal and anal fins fully extended, and the dark color intensified, making the edging of the body patch stand out prominently. Sometimes they exchange blows which can tear the fins, but this damage heals quickly. Unlike other tetras who prefer to live in large shoals, they will also do fine when kept in a group of four or five individuals, making them suitable for smaller aquaria. They still need enough space for the males to stake territories and present themselves to best effort, however.

===Breeding===
The fish should be well conditioned to induce spawning. When possible, live foods are included in the conditioning period. Frozen foods like bloodworms are also used as conditioning food.

The Black phantom tetra is an egg-scattering species. To stimulate breeding, pH is lowered to about 5.5-6, the general hardness of the water is also reduced below four degrees. The breeding tank should have plants, both rooted and floating, and low light.

A female black phantom tetra will produce about 300 eggs. These fish will eat their own eggs and fry, so the parents are usually removed after spawning.

===Raising the fry===
The fry become free-swimming after five days. They are fed infusoria (protozoa) at first. Commercial fry foods of suitable sizes can be used but at all stages the young fish benefit from live food of the right size.

<text>Jeordie Osbourne White (born June 20, 1971), better known as Twiggy Ramirez or simply Twiggy, is an American musician, mostly known as the former bassist and guitarist of the rock band Marilyn Manson. Previously, he was the bassist for A Perfect Circle and a touring member of Nine Inch Nails, and is currently the vocalist for Goon Moon. He left Marilyn Manson in 2002, later rejoined the band in 2008, and was dismissed in 2017. He has been a principal songwriter for the band and has also contributed to some of the Desert Sessions recordings. He also hosted the Hour of Goon podcast with fellow musician Fred Sablan, on the Starburns Audio network.

==Early life==
White was raised in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, before moving to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during his childhood. Influenced by Mötley Crüe, Van Halen and Iron Maiden, he first picked up a guitar at age thirteen. White spent most of his youth in the Fort Lauderdale area, and by age 15, had joined his first band, The Ethiopians. He graduated from J.P. Taravella High School in Coral Springs, Florida.

==Career==
Early in his career, White was in a speed metal cover band called The Ethiopians covering songs such as Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot;. Between 1989 and 1993, White played rhythm guitar and provided backing vocals for Amboog-a-Lard.

===1993–2002; 2008–2017: Marilyn Manson===
White met Marilyn Manson (Brian Warner) on numerous occasions in the late 1980s. After an unexpected meeting at a used records store in the Coral Springs Mall where White was working, the two realized they had much in common, but had yet to work on a musical endeavor. White actively attempted to join Manson&#x27;s band while playing in another project. In March 1993, White took part in Manson&#x27;s side project Mrs. Scabtree and shared vocal duties with then girlfriend Jessicka. Jeordie did not join Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids until Gidget Gein was ejected from the band by the manager in December 1993. White was given the Manson band member name &quot;Twiggy Ramirez&quot;, which was derived by taking the first name from English supermodel Twiggy and the surname from American serial killer Richard Ramirez. White never played bass until Manson bought him his first instrument right after he joined the band. In 1998, White made a cameo in Monster Magnet&#x27;s music video for &quot;Space Lord&quot;. In 2001, White appeared on an MTV Cribs episode: the &quot;Ozzfest Edition&quot;.

As a result of many lineup changes (specifically guitarists), White was largely responsible for most of the songwriting on the albums &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; and &quot;Holy Wood&quot;; for the latter album, he shared credits with John 5. In 2007, White said that he is proud of the work that he did in the band.

On January 9, 2008, Marilyn Manson posted a bulletin on MySpace confirming that Tim Skold was leaving Marilyn Manson and that White had rejoined the band in his place. He toured with Manson as the band&#x27;s new guitarist in support of their seventh studio album. However, he stayed with Goon Moon after the touring of &quot;The High End of Low&quot; finished.

White said in an interview that he would keep working with Manson for their next album, &quot;Born Villain&quot;, which was released on May 1, 2012. While he did not participate in the writing or recording of Marilyn Manson&#x27;s 2015 album, &quot;The Pale Emperor&quot;, he continued to tour with the band. Manson confirmed on Reddit that he intends on collaborating with White for the follow-up to &quot;The Pale Emperor&quot;. Despite this, the band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Heaven Upside Down&quot;, features no contributions from White.

On October 24, 2017, Marilyn Manson posted on Facebook that the band parted ways with White following allegations of sexual misconduct made against him, and announced that there would be a replacement for the upcoming tour.

===2003–present: Other projects===
After departing Marilyn Manson, White played two live shows with California punk metal band Mondo Generator, and auditioned for the role of second guitar in Queens of the Stone Age, which he lost to Troy Van Leeuwen of A Perfect Circle. He also auditioned for a spot as bass player (after Jason Newsted&#x27;s departure) in Metallica, but lost out to former Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo, which is documented briefly in their film, &quot;&quot;.

Several months later, White replaced Paz Lenchantin in A Perfect Circle, the project of Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan and former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel as a full member of the band on bass guitar. White later joined Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme on the ninth and tenth volumes of Homme&#x27;s music project The Desert Sessions. He contributed to Melissa Auf der Maur&#x27;s solo debut and second solo album &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;. He toured with Nine Inch Nails in support of their album &quot;With Teeth&quot;, from 2005 to 2006 and then again in 2007 for &quot;Year Zero&quot;.

White has composed for a range of artists from fictional band Steel Dragon to Bif Naked to his namesake, model Twiggy Lawson with whom he recorded and produced a duet of Dusty Springfield&#x27;s &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; for the soundtrack of the MTV film &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;. In 2005, White worked with Goon Moon and with them released the EP &quot;I Got a Brand New Egg Layin&#x27; Machine&quot;, recorded at Rancho De La Luna, Prescription and Regime Studios. The band released their first full-length album &quot;Licker&#x27;s Last Leg&quot; in May 2007. White appeared on the UNKLE album &quot;War Stories&quot; playing bass and synths on the track &quot;Burn My Shadow&quot;.
White was invited to return to play with A Perfect Circle for their Fall and Winter 2010 Tour in North America, but ultimately did not participate in the reunion and was permanently replaced by Matt McJunkins.

==Personal life==
White cites Oasis, the Who, the Kinks and the Bee Gees as his influences and as his favorite bands.
White has a &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; tattoo as a tribute to Oasis on his left arm. Due to his friendship with Oasis producer Dave Sardy, White got to play bass on a new version of Oasis&#x27; &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; that was submitted to the soundtrack for the 2005 movie &quot;Goal!&quot;, and contributed remixes of &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Time&quot; and &quot;Falling Down&quot; that the band used as b-sides.
It has been emphasized by White personally that if there was one single piece of information the public should know about him it would be that he smells like baby powder.

White married model and makeup artist Alaina &quot;Laney Chantal&quot; Parkhurst on July 26, 2014. The couple later separated. Laney Chantal died on October 31, 2022.

On October 21, 2017, White&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Jessicka Addams, lead singer of the band Jack Off Jill, published a Facebook post accusing White of rape, as well as physical and emotional abuse during their relationship in the 1990s. White issued a statement following the allegations: &quot;I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain I apologize and truly regret it.&quot;

==Preferred equipment==
While in Marilyn Manson, White used the following bass guitars, among many things, showing a strong preference for Gibson instruments, and bass guitars used by his classic rock mentors:

*White owns multiple Gibson Thunderbird bass guitars. During the Guns, God, and Government tour, he toured with 5 Thunderbird bass guitars, most often seen with the pickguard removed, or a matching black pickguard on a black Thunderbird. Each bass guitar had different tunings (Standard, Drop D, etc.) and was used for different songs.
*1992 Gibson Thunderbird IV Reverse (seen in the &quot;Disposable Teens&quot; video; used extensively in live performances from 1998 to 2002, and again for live use since his reunion with Manson in 2008.
*1974 Gibson Ripper L9-S Bass (vintage, as seen in &quot;The Dope Show&quot; video)
*1977 Gibson RD Artist Bass (vintage, as seen in the &quot;Dope Hat&quot; and &quot;Coma White&quot; videos). This bass guitar was sold to a fan through a mutual friend of White and Manson in 2005 via eBay.
*BC Rich Warlock Bass w/ Widow headstock (seen in the &quot;Rock is Dead&quot; video).
*1980s USA BC Rich Warlock bass (4 on a side headstock) Used in live performances from 1998 to 1999, notably during the first live performance of &quot;The Dope Show&quot; on the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. White donated this bass guitar to the Hard Rock Cafe in Ottawa, Canada, where it is among their most popular pieces of memorabilia on display.
*Gibson Les Paul bass. Used live and in the studio. Makes many appearances in early videos (Lunchbox, Get Your Gunn) and saw live use from 1994 to 1997.

During his parting of ways with Manson from 2002 to 2008, he took up the following models as his preferred instruments:

*Fender Precision Deluxe Bass (live, on tour with A Perfect Circle 2003–2004)
*Spector NS-2 Bass (live, on tour with A Perfect Circle 2003–2004)
*Steinberger Spirit Bass (live, on tour with A Perfect Circle 2003–2004)
*Fender Precision Bass (live, on tour with Nine Inch Nails)
*Music Man StingRay 4 Bass (live, on tour with Nine Inch Nails)

In addition to the aforementioned bass guitars, White has used numerous other brands and models of electric and acoustic guitar in writing and recording for each band he has been involved with, and he plays following guitars in live performances.

*Gibson Flying V (With Marilyn Manson)
*Gibson SG (With Goon Moon)
*Gibson ES-335 or Gibson Lucille (With Goon Moon, Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson)

<doc id="550670" wikidata="Q33784" url="?curid=550670" title="Soga language">
<text>Soga, or Lusoga, is a Bantu language spoken by the Soga people of the Busoga region in Eastern Uganda. With over three million speakers, it is one of the major languages of Uganda, after English, Swahili, and Luganda. However, it is largely restricted to the Busoga region, which is mainly within the natural boundaries of Lake Victoria to the south, Lake Kyoga to the north, the Nile river to the west and the Mpologoma (&#x27;Lion&#x27;) river to the east of Namutumba district. It is tonal.

==History and development==
The Soga language is very similar to the neighbouring languages Luganda and Gwere as all 3 descend from a common ancestor language (Proto-North Nyanza). 

The written form of Soga is only as recent as the arrival of the Arab and European traders and missionaries. It first appeared in print in the second half of the nineteenth century.

Soga is used in some primary schools in Busoga as pupils begin to learn English, an official language of Uganda. It is also taught in secondary schools and is offered as a course subject in tertiary institutions such as Busoga University, Kyambogo University and Makerere University.

==Dialects==
Soga has several dialects dating to the intermingling of people during the early migration period of the 17th and 18th centuries. There were so many dialects that it was difficult to reach agreement on the correct way to spell or pronounce certain words. For instance, in the north of Busoga, there is an &#x27;H&#x27; in many words which does not appear in dialects of southern Busoga. Thus Busoga was divided into two dialect zones. Across the northern zone, the dialects &quot;Lulamogi&quot; and &quot;Lupakoyo&quot; were spoken. &quot;Lupakoyo&quot; closely resembled Nyoro. It had a close belt of Runyoro associated dialects running east from Bunyoro, across the northern region of Buganda, across northern Busoga and through Bugwere, which is east of Busoga. In the southern part of Busoga a dialect known as Lutenga was traditionally spoken which resembled Luganda. Related dialects were also spoken in the Ssese Islands, Buvuma Island and eastern Buganda.

But with the establishment of the Lusoga Language Authority (LULA), Busoga Kingdom has promoted a standardised Lusoga language. It has done research on the Lusoga language and published literature in Lusoga. Its publications can be found at the Busoga Cultural Centre Offices library located in the Nile garden in Jinja, Uganda. Others are available in bookshops throughout Busoga and in major bookstores in Kampala and other parts of the country. Some of the more accomplished Lusoga publications include a Lusoga Bible, grammar books, riddles, proverbs, several story books and dictionaries e.g. Eibwanio English/Lusoga – Lusoga/English dictionary. A limited online version is available.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
=== Consonants ===

Sounds in parentheses are attested, but rare.

==Writing system==
==Basic grammar and vocabulary==
In common with other tonal Bantu languages, Lusoga has a noun class system in which prefixes on nouns mark membership of one of the noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives, and verbs reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Some examples of noun classes:

===Possessive prefixes===
In the Bantu languages around the Lake Victoria region in Uganda, nouns are reflected mainly by changing prefixes: human beings are indicated by the prefix &quot;Ba-&quot; (plural), and &quot;Mu-&quot; (singular), and the name of the country &quot;Bu-&quot;.

*mu- person (singular), e.g. &#x27;native of Busoga land&#x27;
*bu- land, e.g. &#x27;land of the Soga&#x27;
*lu- language, e.g. &#x27;language of the Soga&#x27;
*ba- people, e.g. &#x27;the Soga people&#x27;
*ki- customs or traditions, e.g. describes religious tradition or culture common to the Soga people.

===Self-standing pronouns===
* – &#x27;me&#x27;
* – &#x27;you&#x27;

===Always attached to a verb===
* – &#x27;I&#x27;
* – &#x27;you&#x27; (singular)
* – &#x27;he/she&#x27;
* – &#x27;we/us&#x27;

===Greetings===
Greeting in Soga is accomplished just as it is in western countries. However, it assumes a more personal nature and just as in the West, its form depends on the time of the day and the elapsed time since the last contact with the greeter.

The following dialogue illustrates the basic form to greet a peer or an elder in a respectful manner:

:Person A:
: – &#x27;How did you sleep/(How was your day), sir (madam)?&#x27;
:Person B:
: – &#x27;Well, how did you sleep (how was your day), sir (madam)?&#x27;
:Person A:
: – &#x27;Well, sir (madam)&#x27;

The personal nature of the greetings ensues when the individual being greeted chooses to answer the question instead of merely responding with &quot;good&quot; or &quot;fine&quot;. It is somewhat like being asked, &quot;how do you do?&quot; and responding, &quot;how do you do?&quot; However, in Soga, the individual being greeted is free to actually delve into the fine details.

Additionally, simply drop &quot;sir/madam&quot; to achieve the same effect as in English. The above dialog only addresses greeting one person because some words change into multiple others e.g. is the combination of a singular prefix ( – &#x27;you&#x27;), word ( – &#x27;sleep&#x27;), and singular postfix ( – &#x27;how did&#x27;) spoken as one with a plural form that subsequently becomes , which is composed of two distinct words emerging from two different plural prefixes, a word, and the plural form of the postfix. It is sometimes impossible to not separate the plural form.

===Introductions===
* – &#x27;I am Kateme&#x27;

===Some common verbs===
When conjugating the verb, remove and replace it with the required pronoun i.e. , , , , , .

*Example:
** – &#x27;to work/to do&#x27;
*** – &#x27;I work/do&#x27;
*** – &#x27;you work/do&#x27;
*** – &#x27;he/she works/does&#x27;
*** – &#x27;we work/do&#x27;
*** – &#x27;you work/do&#x27; (plural)
*** – &#x27;they work/do&#x27;
* – &#x27;to work/to do&#x27;
* – &#x27;to read/to study&#x27;
* – &#x27;to drink&#x27;
* – &#x27;to eat&#x27; (the above example does not work with all forms of all words, as some verbs are irregular e.g. the singular form here is )
* – &#x27;to walk&#x27;
* – &#x27;to drive/to ride&#x27;
* – &#x27;to be able to&#x27;
* – &#x27;to carry/to take&#x27;
* – &#x27;to laugh&#x27;

===Numbers===
After 1 to 10 and 20, 30, 40, the other numbers build off the same pattern.

===Telling the time===
Hours of darkness in Soga correspond to p.m. to include early morning hours. Essentially, the number representing the current hour simply subtracts six from the number in English. A Musoga waking up at what English speakers would call 10:15 a.m. would instead say (&#x27;the time is 4:15 in the morning&#x27;). Time is said using the word , e.g., – 7 o&#x27;clock.

===Food===
* – &#x27;food&#x27;
* – &#x27;sugar&#x27;
* – &#x27;coffee&#x27;
* – &#x27;milk&#x27;
* – &#x27;chicken&#x27;
* – &#x27;teaspoon&#x27;
* – &#x27;plate&#x27;
* – &#x27;saucepan&#x27;
* – &#x27;cup&#x27;

===General phrases and vocabulary===
* – &#x27;how much&#x27; (price)

<text>Acta Diurna (Latin for &quot;Daily Acts&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;Daily Public Records&quot; or as &quot;Daily Gazette&quot;) were daily Roman official notices, a sort of daily gazette. They were carved on stone or metal and presented in message boards in public places such as the Forum of Rome. They also were called simply &quot;Acta&quot;. In many ways, they functioned like an early newspaper for the Roman citizenry. The Acta were begun in 59 BC and continued until AD 222.

==History==
&quot;Acta Diurna&quot;, also called &quot;Acta Populi&quot;, &quot;Acta Publica&quot;, and simply &quot;Acta&quot; or &quot;Diurna&quot;, in ancient Rome was a sort of daily government gazette, containing an officially authorized narrative of noteworthy events at Rome. Its contents were partly official (court news, decrees of the Roman emperor, Roman Senate, and Roman magistrates), and partly private (notices of births, marriages, and deaths). Thus, to some extent it filled the place of the modern newspaper.

The origin of the &quot;Acta&quot; is attributed to Julius Caesar, who first ordered the keeping and publishing of the acts of the people by public officers (59 B.C.; Suetonius, Caesar, 20). The &quot;Acta&quot; were drawn up from day to day, and exposed in a public place on a whitened board called an &quot;Album&quot;. After remaining there for a reasonable time they were taken down and preserved with other public documents, so that they might be available for purposes of research.

The &quot;Acta&quot; differed from the Annals (which were discontinued in 133 BC) in that only the greater and more important matters were given in the latter, while in the former things of less note were recorded. Their publication continued till the transference of the seat of the empire to Constantinople. There are no genuine fragments extant.

Sometimes scribes made copies of the &quot;Acta&quot; and sent them to governors for information. Later emperors used them to announce royal or senatorial decrees and events of the court. Other forms of &quot;Acta&quot; were legal, municipal, and military notices.

&quot;Acta Diurna&quot; introduced the expression “publicare et propagare”, which means &quot;make public and propagate&quot;. This expression was set in the end of the texts and proclaimed a release to both Roman citizens and non-citizens.

<doc id="550684" wikidata="Q815170" url="?curid=550684" title="Siege of La Rochelle">
<text>The siege of La Rochelle (, or sometimes ) was a result of a war between the French royal forces of Louis XIII of France and the Huguenots of La Rochelle in 1627–1628. The siege marked the height of the struggle between the Catholics and the Protestants in France, and ended with a complete victory for King Louis XIII and the Catholics.

==Background==
The 1598 Edict of Nantes that ended the French Wars of Religion granted Protestants, commonly known as Huguenots, a large degree of autonomy and self-rule. La Rochelle was the centre of Huguenot seapower, and a key point of resistance against the Catholic royal government.

The assassination of Henry IV of France in 1610 led to the appointment of Marie de&#x27; Medici as regent for her nine-year-old son, Louis XIII. Her removal in 1617 caused a series of revolts by powerful regional nobles, both Catholic and Protestant, while religious tensions were heightened by the outbreak of the 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years War. In 1621, Louis re-established Catholicism in the formerly Huguenot region of Béarn, resulting in an uprising led by Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise.

Despite the royalist capture of Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély, a blockade of La Rochelle was unsuccessful and the revolt ended in stalemate with the October 1622 Treaty of Montpellier. Taking La Rochelle was a priority for Louis and his chief minister Cardinal Richelieu; it was then the second- or third-largest city in France, with over 30,000 inhabitants, and one of its most important ports. In addition to the customs duties generated by imports, it was also among the biggest producers of salt, a major source of taxes for the state; this made it economically crucial.

Defeating Rohan and taking possession of La Rochelle were both essential for Richelieu&#x27;s policy of centralisation, but since the French Crown did not have a navy strong enough to capture it, he asked England for help. When James I refused, he approached the Dutch Republic. The Huguenots were supported by Spain, who the Protestant Dutch were then fighting for their independence; in return for French subsidies, the Dutch agreed to provide naval backing in the 1624 Treaty of Compiègne.

==English intervention==
The Anglo-French conflict followed the failure of their alliance of 1624, in which England had tried to find an ally in France against the power of the Habsburgs. In 1626, France under Richelieu concluded a secret peace with Spain, and disputes arose around Henrietta Maria&#x27;s household. Furthermore, France was building the power of its navy, leading the English to be convinced that France must be opposed &quot;for reasons of state&quot;.

In June 1626, Walter Montagu was sent to France to contact dissident noblemen, and from March 1627 attempted to organize a French rebellion. The plan was to send an English fleet to encourage rebellion, triggering a new Huguenot revolt by Duke Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise.

===First La Rochelle expedition===

On the first expedition, King Charles I sent a fleet of over 100 ships, under his favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, to encourage a major rebellion in La Rochelle. In June 1627, Buckingham organised a landing on the nearby island of Île de Ré with 6,000 men in order to help the Huguenots, thus starting the Anglo-French War of 1627, with the objectives being to control the approaches to La Rochelle and to encourage the rebellion in the city.

The city of La Rochelle initially refused to declare itself an ally of Buckingham against the crown of France and effectively denied access to its harbour to Buckingham&#x27;s fleet. An open alliance would be declared only in September, during the first fights between La Rochelle and royal troops.

Although it was a Protestant stronghold, Île de Ré had not directly joined the rebellion against the king. On Île de Ré, the English under Buckingham tried to take the fortified city of Saint-Martin in the siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré (1627) but were repulsed after three months. Small French royal boats managed to supply St Martin in spite of the English blockade. Buckingham ultimately ran out of money and support, and his army was weakened by disease. After a last attack on Saint-Martin, they were repulsed with heavy casualties and left with their ships.

==Siege==


Meanwhile, in August 1627 French royal forces started to surround La Rochelle, with an army of 7,000 soldiers, 600 horses, and 24 cannons, led by Charles of Angoulême. They started to reinforce fortifications at Bongraine (modern Les Minimes), and at the Fort Louis.

On September 10, the first cannon shots were fired by La Rochelle against royal troops at Fort Louis, starting the third Huguenot rebellion. La Rochelle was the greatest stronghold among the Huguenot cities of France, and the centre of Huguenot resistance. Cardinal Richelieu acted as commander of the besiegers when the King was absent.

Once hostilities started, French engineers isolated the city with entrenchments long, fortified by 11 forts and 18 redoubts. The surrounding fortifications were completed in April 1628, manned with an army of 30,000.

Four thousand workmen also built a long seawall to block the seaward access between the city and harbor, stopping all supplies. The initial idea for blocking the channel came from the Italian engineer Pompeo Targone, but his structure was broken by winter weather, before the idea was taken up by the royal architect Clément Métezeau in November 1627. The wall was built on a foundation of sunken hulks filled with rubble. French artillery battered English ships trying to supply the city.

Meanwhile, in southern France, Henri de Rohan vainly attempted to raise a rebellion to relieve La Rochelle. Until February, some ships were able to go through the seawall under construction, but after March this became impossible. The city was completely blockaded, with the only hope coming from possible intervention by an English fleet.

===Foreign support for the French Crown===
====Dutch support====
The Roman Catholic government of France rented ships from the Protestant city of Amsterdam to conquer the Protestant city of La Rochelle. This resulted in a debate in the city council of Amsterdam as to whether the French soldiers should be allowed to have a Roman Catholic sermon on board of the Protestant Dutch ships. The result of the debate was that it was not allowed. The Dutch ships transported the French soldiers to La Rochelle. France was a Dutch ally in the war against the Habsburgs.

====Spanish alliance====
In the occasion of the siege of La Rochelle, Spain manoeuvered towards the formation of a Franco-Spanish alliance against the common enemies that were the English, the Huguenots, and the Dutch. Richelieu accepted Spanish help, and a Spanish fleet of 30 to 40 warships was sent from Corunna to the Gulf of Morbihan as an affirmation of strategic support, arriving three weeks after the departure of Buckingham from Île de Ré. At one point, the Spanish fleet anchored in front of La Rochelle, but did not engage in actual operations against the city.

===English relief efforts===
England attempted to send two more fleets to relieve La Rochelle.

====Second La Rochelle expedition====
A naval force led by William Feilding, Earl of Denbigh, left in April 1628, but returned without a fight to Portsmouth, as Denbigh said that he had no commission to hazard the king&#x27;s ships in a fight, and returned shamefully to Portsmouth.

====Third La Rochelle expedition====
A third fleet was dispatched under the Admiral of the Fleet, the Earl of Lindsey in September 1628, consisting of 29 warships and 31 merchantmen.
In September 1628, the English fleet tried to relieve the city. After bombarding French positions and failing to force the sea wall, the English fleet had to withdraw. Following this last disappointment, the city surrendered on 28 October 1628.

==Epilogue==


Residents of La Rochelle had resisted for 14 months, under the leadership of the mayor Jean Guitton and with gradually diminishing help from England. During the siege, the population of La Rochelle decreased from 27,000 to 5,000 due to casualties, famine, and disease.

Surrender was unconditional. By the terms of the Peace of Alais, the Huguenots lost their territorial, political, and military rights, but retained the religious freedom granted by the Edict of Nantes. However, they were left at the mercy of the monarchy, unable to resist later when Louis XIV abolished the Edict of Nantes altogether and embarked on active persecution.

Aside from its religious aspect, the siege of La Rochelle marks an important success in the creation of a strong central government of France, in control throughout its territory and able to suppress regional defiance. In the immediate aftermath was the growth of the absolute monarchy, but it had long-term effects upon all later French regimes up to the present.

The French philosopher Descartes is known to have visited the scene of the siege in 1627.

The siege was depicted in detail by numerous artists such as Jacques Callot and marked by the 1635 painting &quot;Louis XIII Crowned by Victory&quot;.

==Numismatics==
Around the time of the siege, a series of propaganda coins were cast to describe the stakes of the siege, and then commemorate the royal victory. These coins depict the siege in symbolic ways, showing the city and the English effort in a poor light, while putting an advantageous light on royal might.

==In popular culture==
The siege forms the historical background for the novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père and the book&#x27;s numerous adaptations to stage, screen, comics and video game.

The 11th book of Robert Merle&#x27;s &quot;Fortune de France&quot; series, &quot;La Gloire et les perils&quot;, deals entirely with the siege.

In Lawrence Norfolk&#x27;s 1991 novel, &quot;Lemprière&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, the siege is the central cause of events (entirely fictional) 160 years later in London around the writing of John Lemprière&#x27;s &quot;Classical Dictionary containing a full Account of all the Proper Names mentioned in Ancient Authors&quot;. In the novel, a group of eight (originally nine) merchants cause the deaths of most (if not all) of the citizens of La Rochelle by manipulating them into committing mass suicide before escaping the city in subterranean tunnels. This event leads to one of Lemprière&#x27;s ancestors (whom is said to be a member of the nine merchants) turning against the merchants and also forms a being known as the &quot;Sprite of La Rochelle&quot;.

Taylor Caldwell writes about the siege in great detail in her 1943 novel &quot;The Arm and the Darkness&quot; but has as its commander the fictional Huguenot nobleman Arsene de Richepin, one of the central characters of the book.

<doc id="550685" wikidata="Q6394481" url="?curid=550685" title="Kerry Burke">
<text>Sir Thomas Kerry Burke (born 24 March 1942) is a former New Zealand politician and Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. He was a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party from 1972 to 1975 and again from 1978 to 1990, and later served twelve years on Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury) from 1998 to 2010.

==Early life and career==
Burke was born in Christchurch in 1942. He attended Opawa Primary School and Linwood College. In 1960, he began three years of study at the University of Canterbury, after which he studied for a year at the Christchurch College of Education. He taught at Rangiora High School from 1967 to 1972. From 1969 to 1971 he was chairman of the Rangiora branch of the Post Primary Teachers&#x27; Association (PPTA) union.

==Member of Parliament==
===Third Labour government===


Burke was first elected to Parliament as the Labour MP for Rangiora in the 1972 election. From 1973 to 1978 he was a Lincoln College Council member.

In the 1975 election, however, he lost his seat, and remained outside Parliament for three years.

===Political interregnum===
After his defeat he took consolation that the swing against him in his electorate was lower than the overall swing against the government. He also appreciated that leaving parliament would give him more time to spend with his sons. He decided to return to teaching, though found there to be no teaching vacancies in Canterbury at the time. This prompted him to move to the West Coast to teach at Greymouth High School from 1976 to 1978.

He established himself locally and when the local MP, Paddy Blanchfield, announced his retirement Burke sought the Labour Party candidacy. Despite facing criticisms as an outsider, he won the nomination over eight other candidates.

===Opposition===
In the 1978 election, Burke was elected as the MP for the West Coast electorate. After reentering Parliament he criticised the closure of several gasworks in his electorate as well as the resulting employee reductions at the Liverpool coal mine after subsidies for them were cut by the Muldoon government.

He was elevated to the shadow cabinet by Labour leader Bill Rowling in 1979 and was Shadow Minister of Labour and State Services from 1979 to 1980, Shadow Minister of Employment and Science &amp; Technology from 1981 to 1982 and Shadow Minister of Employment, Regional Development and Tourism from 1982 to 1983. He supported Rowling when he was challenged for the leadership in 1980 by deputy leader David Lange.

When Lange replaced Rowling in 1983 Burke fell in the rankings and was left only with the regional development portfolio.

===Fourth Labour government===
When Labour won the 1984 election, Burke became Minister of Immigration and Minister of Employment. He held these roles until the 1987 election, when he was chosen to replace the outgoing Gerry Wall as Speaker. At 45 he was the second youngest Speaker in the history of the Parliament of New Zealand.

He served in this role for three years, losing the Speakership and his seat when Labour lost the 1990 election. In the 1990 New Year Honours, Burke was appointed a Knight Bachelor, and the same year he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He did not contest West Coast in the 1993 election; Damien O&#x27;Connor succeeded him as Labour&#x27;s candidate.

== Local government career ==
After leaving Parliament, Burke returned to Canterbury. He contested and was elected to the Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury) in 1998, beginning what would be 12 years of service. He first became chairman in 2004 and was reelected to the chair after the 2007 local elections. On 24 September 2009, Burke lost a motion of no confidence and was replaced as chairman by former National MP Alec Neill. The council was removed in 2010 and replaced by Government-appointed commissioners. The reason cited for the sacking was due to poor direction, &quot;woeful&quot; performance and governance and an overall collapse of confidence in the organisation.

In the 2010 local elections, Burke stood for Christchurch City Council in the Spreydon-Heathcote ward but was beaten by the two incumbents (Sue Wells and Barry Corbett).

==Personal life==
Burke had two sons with his first wife Jenny. He remarried with journalist Helen Paske in October 1984, with whom he had a third son in 1985. Paske died in 1989.

At one time Burke was patron of Cholmondeley Children&#x27;s Home in Governors Bay. In March 2012 he joined the board of the Draco Foundation (NZ) Charitable Trust, an organisation whose purpose is the protection and promotion of democracy and natural justice in New Zealand. The trust was denied charitable status by the Charities Commission and on appeal by the High Court of New Zealand the Draco organisation was found to have no public benefit and was set up for political purposes.

In January 2016, aged 73, Burke was convicted of drink driving having 517 μg of alcohol per litre of breath. He was fined $400 and disqualified from driving for six months.

<doc id="550686" wikidata="Q273017" url="?curid=550686" title="Évian-les-Bains">
<text>Évian-les-Bains (), or simply Évian (, , or ), is a commune in Eastern France, by the border with Switzerland. It is located in the northern part of the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

A high-market holiday resort and spa town on the shores of Lake Geneva (), it has been visited, over two centuries, by royalty such as Kings Edward VII and George V of the United Kingdom and King Farouk of Egypt, and celebrities such as countess Anna de Noailles and Marcel Proust.

==History==
===Birth of an elite spa town===
The springs of Evian were still rather unknown at the time of the French Revolution. But the First Empire&#x27;s interest for spa towns inspired a scientist to analyse the Evian springs in 1807 and 1808.

A lakeside port and a new road (RN5) connecting the town to Milan and Paris were constructed in 1809. In 1823, Genevan entrepreneur M. Fauconnet launched the Évian mineral water company (&quot;Société des Eaux Minérales d&#x27;Évian&quot;) and purchased the city&#x27;s two main springs (the better-known being the &quot;Cachat&quot; spring named after the family that sold it) in March 1827. M. Fauconnet&#x27;s company eventually went bankrupt, and the springs were bought by the Hôtel des Bains.

In the following years, many hotels (Hôtel des quatre saisons, Hôtel de France, Hôtel des Alpes) were built, helping the town&#x27;s popularity as a holiday resort.

===Golden Age of the Belle epoque and the Roaring Twenties===

The Cachat mineral waters SA (&quot;Société Anonyme des Eaux Minérales de Cachat&quot;) was created as an anonymous company in December 1859 by Parisian investors, selling Évian water, and in 1865 the small town changed its name to Évian-les-bains to promote its rise as a spa town. Three other springs joined the Cachat (Guillot, Bonnevie, Corporau). Improvement in transportation (a railroad station) helped make the town a more famous spa.

In the late 19th century, the city contained more than 20 hotels. The hills and the lakeshore were covered with noble houses and luxurious villas and a theatre and a casino were built on the lakeside. In 1902, the baths were constructed and in 1909, the architect Hébrard built one of the most luxurious hotels: the Royal Hotel. Evian considers itself one of the top European spas, claiming popularity with high society figures such as Countess Anna de Noailles, Frédéric Mistral, the Lumiere Brothers and Marcel Proust.

After World War I, the city maintained its status as a high-class spa town, hosting socialites and royalty such as Aga Khan III, the Maharaja of Kapurthala, Albert Lebrun (President of the République), King George V of United Kingdom and King Fuad I of Egypt.

The Évian Conference was convened in Évian in July 1938 to discuss the problem of Jewish refugees. During World War II, German forces occupied Évian and the town&#x27;s statue of General Dupas was removed.

===Contemporary===

The Évian Accords, which ended the Algerian War and recognized an independent Algeria, were signed there on 18 March 1962. The G8 began its 29th summit meeting in Évian on 1 June 2003.
From 26 to 30 August 2015 the 6th Annual Summit of the G-20Y Association was held there.

Évian still derives funding as a holiday resort and spa town.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The climate is continental mountainous, characterized by a marked humidity. Winters are cold and snowy and the summer season is mild with occasional stormy episodes. The off-seasons (April and October) are also on average relatively humid.

==Economy==
The town is home to Évian mineral water, which adds significantly to the economy, together with the Casino d&#x27;Evian, the largest themed casino in Europe, and the Evian Royal Resort, the reported favorite holiday destination of former French President François Mitterrand and King Farouk of Egypt. Many of the inhabitants of Évian work in Lausanne and other Swiss cities nearby.

The two largest hotels in Évian are the Hotel Royal (where the G8 summit was held) and the Hilton.

==Transport==

Évian is served by a bus network, as well as a train station with regular trains to Geneva, Annemasse, and Bellegarde, as well as less frequent services to Paris and Lyon. There is also a very busy ferry service running between the town and Lausanne, as well as a more tourist-centered service that runs to Yvoire.

==Education==
Public nursery/preschools and primary schools serving the town include: Ecole du Centre, Ecole de la Détanche, Ecoles du Mur Blanc, and Ecole des Hauts d&#x27;Evian. Collège des Rives du Léman is the public junior high school, and Lycée Anna de Noailles is the senior high school.

Ecole Saint-Bruno is a private nursery/preschool, primary school, and junior high school.

== Sport ==
The town has some golf courses, and hosts The Evian Championship women&#x27;s professional golf tournament, founded in 1994, every summer. Now it is one of the five women&#x27;s major championships.

The Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. football club was located here before relocating to Thonon-les-Bains.

<text>Jean-Claude Romand (born 11 February 1954) is a French spree killer and impostor who pretended to be a medical doctor for the World Health Organization for 18 years before killing his wife, children, and parents in January 1993, when he was about to be exposed.

In 1996, Romand was sentenced to life in prison for the 1993 murders. During his imprisonment, he worked to restore audio documents for the INA, and train other prisoners in audio restoration.

On 28 June 2019, Romand was granted conditional release and was released from prison under electronic monitoring to a Benedictine monastery, the Notre-Dame de Fontgombault abbey, whose monks agreed to receive Romand for 2 years. Reportedly having become very pious during his time in prison, Romand lived under strict conditions with the monks of the abbey, only being allowed to leave the premises for a few hours a day. Romand participated in the daily life of the 70 monks of the abbey during his time there, working in particular on agricultural work on the few hectares of the abbey estate, and was housed in the hotel section of the abbey.

Romand was released from the monastery in 2022 and is no longer required to wear an ankle bracelet. He lives in hiding in a village in Indre, with a retirement pension about 800 euros. Romand remains obligated to continue to pay reimbursements to his victims. He is forbidden to contact the families of the victims, to appear in the media, or to appear in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Ile-de-France or Bourgogne-Franche-Comté areas. He is required to inform his judge when moving his residence, or when leaving Indre for a period of over two weeks.

Romand has also been suspected to have played a part in the death of his father-in-law, Pierre Crolet, who fell from a staircase on 23 October 1988. Romand was the only witness to the alleged accident.

== Biography ==

Jean-Claude Romand was born on 11 February 1954 in Lons-le-Saunier and grew up in the village Clairvaux-les-Lacs in the &quot;département&quot; of Jura. He studied at the &quot;lycée&quot; of Lons-le-Saunier until his &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. In 1971, he registered at the &quot;classes préparatoires&quot; of Lycée du Parc in Lyon but dropped out after one term. Afterwards he enrolled as a medical student.

Romand told friends and family that he had passed the first and second year medical examinations in 1975, when in fact he had purposely avoided taking either. He never qualified as a doctor, which was unknown by his parents.

For 18 years, Romand posed as a successful medical professional and researcher in the World Health Organization (WHO). He claimed that he had researched arteriosclerosis and that he had contact with political figures.

In reality, he spent his days wandering and used the free information services of the local WHO building. He lived close by in Prévessin-Moëns, France. Periodically, he left for a supposed work trip but travelled only as far as Geneva International Airport and spent a couple of days in a hotel room there, studying medical journals and a travel guide about the various countries he lied about visiting. Romand lived off the money his wife and he had made by selling an apartment, from his wife&#x27;s salary and from money given to him by various relatives, who were told that he was investing it in various hedge funds and foreign ventures.

Jean-Claude Romand is the only witness to the death of his father-in-law, Pierre Crolet, on 23 October 1988. Pierre Crolet had a fatal fall on the stairs of his house a few days after asking for reimbursement of part of his financial investment. When the rescuers arrived on the scene they claimed to have heard him stammer: &quot;&quot;Jean-Claude m&#x27;a, Jean-Claude m&#x27;a.&quot;..&quot; (&quot;Jean-Claude [missing verb]d me&quot;) before Jean-Claude intervened to put an oxygen mask on the face of his father-in-law. Pierre died of his injuries a few days later without waking up. The courts ruled it an accident and Romand was not prosecuted, later organizing his father-in-law&#x27;s funeral and launching a fundraiser. He subsequently diverted all donations.

== Actions on the night of the murder ==
On 9 January 1993, Romand withdrew 2,000 francs (equivalent to € in ) and borrowed a .22 rifle from his father, for which he purchased a suppressor and gas canisters and asked for them to be gift wrapped. That night, according to the authorities, he beat his wife to death on the couple&#x27;s double bed with a rolling pin. He left her body in bed, as if she were sleeping as normal. The next morning, Saturday, 10 January 1993, he woke his children, had breakfast and watched cartoons with them. He then made them go back to their beds, where he shot them both in the head. After these killings, the only people who could expose him were his parents and his ex-mistress, who wanted back the 900,000 francs that she had loaned him as a favour.

Around noon the same day, Romand travelled to his parents&#x27; house, where he joined them for lunch. Immediately after the meal, he repeatedly shot both of them and the family dog.

In the evening, he picked up his ex-mistress, telling her they were invited to a dinner with the then-health minister, Bernard Kouchner. Pretending that they were lost, he made her get out of the car and attempted to strangle her with a cord, spraying tear gas into her face. When she fought back, he apologized and drove her back to her home, after making her promise never to tell anyone about his attempt to murder her. He then returned to his family home, which still contained the bodies of his dead wife and children.

That night, he sat and watched television before he poured petrol around the house, set it on fire, and took an overdose of sleeping pills. Whether this suicide attempt was genuine is doubtful, since some writers have pointed out that the pills he took were long expired and he had access to more effective barbiturates. Furthermore, he started the fire at 4 o’clock in the morning, right around the time the road cleaners were passing by. They immediately alerted the local firefighters, who arrived in time to rescue Romand.

He survived the blaze but refused to talk to police during subsequent questioning.

==Aftermath==
Romand&#x27;s trial for the murder of his family began on 25 June 1996. On 6 July 1996, Romand was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 22 years; he became eligible for parole in 2015. An appeals court in Bourges granted Romand parole in 2019; he had been imprisoned for 26 years. He was released into the custody of a nearby Benedictine monastery and had an electronic bracelet placed on him to ensure he did not try to escape. Romand is reputed to suffer from narcissistic personality disorder.

== Documentary, fiction and scholarship ==

French author Emmanuel Carrère corresponded with Romand during his imprisonment and wrote a book, &quot;L&#x27;Adversaire&quot; (&quot;The Adversary&quot;), based on the case. Nicole Garcia directed a movie, &quot;L&#x27;Adversaire&quot; (2002), based on the book; actor Daniel Auteuil played the part of Romand (renamed Jean-Marc Faure in the film).

Two other films were loosely based on Romand&#x27;s life: the French &quot;L&#x27;Emploi du temps&quot; (2001) (English title: &quot;Time Out&quot;) and the Spanish &quot;&quot; (English title: &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Life&quot;).

Romand&#x27;s deception also formed the basis of the &#x27;Subterraneans&#x27; episode of the BBC crime drama &quot;Waking The Dead&quot; (third episode of the fifth series in 2005). Episode 16 (season 1) &#x27;Phantom&#x27; of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; is also constructed around this story.

Philosopher Jean Baudrillard analyzed Romand&#x27;s case in his book of essays &quot;The Intelligence of Evil or the Lucidity Pact&quot;. He describes Romand&#x27;s secret life not as a dissimulation but as a genuine doubling: &quot;To transfigure insignificance and banality, all that is needed is to turn them into a parallel universe. There is no simulation in all this.&quot; He also claims that such a long pretense would be impossible without some kind of complicity: &quot;One can no more explain the silence of those around him than Romand&#x27;s own silence. The deeper he gets into his stratagem, the deeper the others retreat into their absence of curiosity. It is genuinely a conspiracy.&quot;

<doc id="550688" wikidata="Q358325" url="?curid=550688" title="Ivo of Kermartin">
<text>Ivo of Kermartin, TOSF (17 October 1253 – 19 May 1303), also known as &quot;Yvo&quot;, &quot;Yves&quot;, or &quot;Ives&quot; (and in Breton as &quot;Erwan&quot;, &quot;Iwan&quot;, &quot;Youenn&quot; or &quot;Eozenn&quot;, depending on the region, and known as &quot;Yves Hélory&quot; (also &quot;Helori&quot; or &quot;Heloury&quot;) in French), was a parish priest among the poor of Louannec, the only one of his station to be canonized in the Middle Ages. He is the patron of Brittany, lawyers, and abandoned children. His feast day is 19 May. Poetically, he is referred to as &quot;advocate of the poor&quot;.

==His Life==
Born at Kermartin, a manor near Tréguier in Brittany, on 17 October 1253, Ivo was the son of Helori, lord of Kermartin, and Azo du Kenquis. In 1267 Ivo was sent to the Faculty of Law of Paris (University of Paris), where he graduated in civil law. While other students caroused, Ivo studied, prayed and visited the sick. He also refused to eat meat or drink wine. Among his fellow-students were the scholars Duns Scotus and Roger Bacon. He went to Orléans in 1277 to study canon law under Peter de la Chapelle, a famous journalist who later became bishop of Toulouse and a cardinal.
On his return to Brittany, having received minor orders, he was appointed an &quot;official&quot;, the title given to an ecclesiastical judge, of the archdeanery of Rennes (1280). He protected orphans and widows, defended the poor, and rendered fair and impartial verdicts. It is said that even those on the losing side respected his decisions. Ivo also represented the helpless in other courts, paid their expenses and visited them in prison. Although it was common to give judges &quot;gifts&quot;, Ivo refused bribes. He often helped many disputing parties settle out of court so they could save money.

Meanwhile, he studied Scripture, and there are strong reasons for believing the tradition held among Franciscans that he joined the Third Order of St. Francis sometime later at Guingamp. Ivo was ordained to the priesthood in 1284. He continued to practice law and once, when a mother and son could not resolve many of their differences, he offered a Mass for them. They immediately reached a settlement.

Ivo was soon invited by the Bishop of Tréguier to become his official, and accepted the offer in 1284. He displayed great zeal and rectitude in the discharge of his duty and did not hesitate to resist taxation by the king, which he considered an encroachment on the rights of the Church. Due to his charity he gained the title of advocate and patron of the poor. Having been ordained he was appointed to the parish of Tredrez in 1285. 

Eight years later he was sent to Louannec, where he and built a hospital and himself helped care for the sick. Ivo died in 1303 of natural causes after a life of hard work and repeated fasting.

==The Widow of Tours==
John Wigmore retells the famous story of St. Ives and the Widow of Tours, writing in the &quot;Fordham Law Review&quot; in 1936:

Tours was near Orleans; the bishop held his court there; and Ivo, while visiting the court, lodged with a certain widow. One day he found his widow-landlady in tears. Her tale was that next day she must go to court to answer to the suit of a traveling merchant who had tricked her. It seemed that two of them, Doe and Roe, lodging with her, had left in her charge a casket of valuables, while they went off on their business, but with the strict injunction that she was to deliver it up again only to the two of them jointly demanding it. That day, Doe had come back, and called for the casket, saying that his partner Roe was detained elsewhere. She in good faith in his story had delivered the casket to Doe, but then later came Roe demanding it, charging his partner with wronging him, and holding the widow responsible for delivering up the casket to Doe contrary to the terms of their directions. She stated if she had to pay for those valuables it would ruin her. &quot;Have no fear&quot;, said young Ivo, &quot;You should indeed have waited for the two men to appear together, but I will go to court tomorrow, for you, and will save you from ruin&quot;. So when the case was called before the Judge, and the merchant Roe charged the widow with breach of faith, &quot;Not so&quot;, pleaded Ivo, &quot;My client need not yet make answer to this claim. The plaintiff has not proved his case. The terms of the bailment were that the casket should be demanded by the two merchants coming together, but here is only one of them making the demand. &quot;Where is the other? Let the plaintiff produce his partner.&quot; The judge promptly approved his plea, whereupon the merchant, required to produce his fellow, turned pale, fell a-trembling, and would have retired. The judge, suspecting something from his plight, ordered him to be arrested and questioned; the other merchant was also traced and brought in, and the casket was recovered; which, when opened, was found to contain nothing but old junk. In short, the two rascals had conspired to plant the casket with the widow, and then to coerce her to pay them the value of the alleged contents. Thus the young advocate saved the widow from ruin.

==His Legacy==
On the occasion of the 700th anniversary of the death of St. Ivo, Pope John Paul II said, &quot;The values proposed by St Ivo retain an astonishing timeliness. His concern to promote impartial justice and to defend the rights of the poorest persons invites the builders of Europe today to make every effort to ensure that the rights of all, especially the weakest, are recognized and defended.&quot;

Saint Yves is the patron of lawyers. As a result, many law schools and association of catholic lawyers have taken his names. For instance, the Society of St. Yves in Jerusalem (a Catholic Center for Human Rights and Legal Aid, Resources and Development), the in Luxembourg (the Luxembourg Catholic Lawyers Association), or the Association de la Saint Yves Lyonnais.

==Veneration==
He was buried in Minihy-Tréguier in the church he founded.

Bretons sang a song about Ivo:

Ivo was canonized in June 1347 by Clement VI at the urging of Philip I, Duke of Burgundy. At the inquest into his sanctity in 1331, many of his parishioners testified as to his goodness, that he preached regularly in both chapel and field, and that under him &quot;the people of the land became twice as good as they had been before&quot;. The connection between religion and good behaviour was especially stressed in his sermons.

Shortly after 1362, the future saint Jeanne-Marie de Maillé reported a vision of Yves (and an ecstasy, &quot;raptus&quot;), during which he told her, &quot;If you are willing to abandon the world, you will taste here on earth the joys of heaven.&quot;

Ivo is often represented with a purse in his right hand (for all the money he gave to the poor during his life) and a rolled paper in the other hand (for his charge as a judge). Another popular representation of Ivo is between a rich man and a poor one. The churches of Sant&#x27;Ivo alla Sapienza and Sant&#x27;Ivo dei Bretoni in Rome are dedicated to him.

<text>Clara Henriette Sophie Westhoff (21 September 1878 – 9 March 1954), also known by her married name Clara Rilke or Clara Rilke-Westhoff was a pioneer German sculptor and artist.

==Early life and career==
At 17, Westhoff went to Munich, where she attended a private art school. In 1898 she moved to Worpswede and learned sculpture with Fritz Mackensen. She befriended Paula Becker (later Modersohn-Becker) and Ottilie Reylaender, who were painters there. She continued her studies in 1899 with Carl Seffner and Max Klinger in Leipzig and, in 1900, trained with Auguste Rodin in Paris, also attending the Académie Colarossi.

By 1925 Westhoff had turned to painting so that, in addition to her sculptural work, she created an equally substantial body of work in painting.

==Personal life and death==
In 1901 she married the poet Rainer Maria Rilke in Worpswede. Eighteen years later, she moved to Fischerhude with her daughter, Ruth Rilke. Her home there with a studio later became the &quot;Café Rilke&quot;, which still exists. She died in Fischerhude on 9 March 1954.

==Legacy==
Her work was privately owned or barely accessible to the public in various collections. 

With her comprehensive biography in 1986, Marina Sauer initiated a rehabilitation of the artist by freeing Clara Rilke-Westhoff from being seen only as the wife of Rilke and as a friend of Paula Modersohn-Becker. Clara Rilke-Westhoff is a pioneer among women sculptors in Germany.

<doc id="550695" wikidata="Q1780322" url="?curid=550695" title="Commodification">
<text>Commodification is the process of transforming inalienable, free, or gifted things (objects, services, ideas, nature, personal information, people or animals) into commodities, or objects for sale. It has a connotation of losing an inherent quality or social relationship when something is integrated by a capitalist marketplace. Concepts that have been argued as being commodified include broad items such as the body, intimacy, public goods, animals and holidays.

== History ==

=== Terminology ===
The earliest use of the word &quot;commodification&quot; dates from 1975. Use of the concept of commodification became common with the rise of critical discourse analysis in semiotics. The terms commodification and commoditization are sometimes used synonymously, to describe the process of making commodities out of goods, services, and ideas.

However, other authors distinguish them, with commodification used in social contexts to mean that a non-commercial good has become commercial, typically with connotations of &quot;corrupted by commerce&quot;, while commoditization is used in business contexts to mean when the market for an existing product has become a commodity market, where products are interchangeable and there is heavy price competition. In a quip: &quot;Microprocessors are commoditized. Love is commodified.&quot;

=== In Marxist Theory ===

The Marxist understanding of &quot;commodity&quot; is distinct from its meaning in business. Commodity played a key role throughout Karl Marx&#x27;s work; he considered it a cell-form of capitalism and a key starting point for an analysis of this politico-economic system. Marx extensively criticized the social impact of commodification under the name commodity fetishism and alienation.

Prior to being turned into a commodity, an object has a &quot;specific individual use value&quot;. After becoming a commodity, that same object has a different value: the amount for which it can be exchanged for another commodity. According to Marx, this new value of the commodity is derived from the time taken to produce the good, and other considerations are obsolete, including morality, environmental impact, and aesthetic appeal.

Marx claimed that everything would eventually be commodified: &quot;the things which until then had been communicated, but never exchanged, given, but never sold, acquired, but never bought – virtue, love, conscience – all at last enter into commerce.&quot;

=== Mass Communication Studies ===
Media, as a culture industry, is apparent from the rise of mass communications to monetize a populace for profit. Research in critical cultural studies of media effects identify commodification of culture as a recent large contributing force for disruption of a society by mass media. An example is the display of American culture to the population within its borders and abroad. The commodity being sold is America, but mediated to show only the most exciting, dramatic, attention-getting, emotion-rousing aspects. Media corporations are expert at analyzing and selecting appealing elements of the culture, then repackaging and enhancing those elements for a wide audience. The quest for large viewership creates an image that does not show boring, unpleasant, or minority aspects of America. The distribution of the alternate form of the culture, for profit, causes misconceptions and stereotyping along with disruption of the original folk culture. Within the United States, the commodification of culture is the mediated view of American society accepted as the culture and even advanced by the culture depicted; the example given is hip-hop and rap music artists stars &quot;selling out&quot;. The United States, with media corporations less prone to governmental interference, is successful at spreading American culture worldwide.

Critical cultural research reveal consequences for the lifting of bits of culture, remolding for a mass audience, then selling the alternate view. A few of repercussions of commodification of culture: Only selected, majority cultural practices are shown leaving out other important minority cultures which are overlooked and/or ignored. As in Hollywood movies, only selected most exciting, dramatic, emotional aspects are presented while removing unpleasant, controversial or the boring. The success of marketing a culture entails distributing as much content as possible to the largest audience, causing disruption of everyday life. Elite media industries are ignorant or deny effects of mass marketing, by avoidance or by explaining that media has limited effects. There are many types of disruptions, some subtle, many obvious, including, propagation of misconceptions, loss of sense of place, a major focus on entertainment, loss of childhood, cultivation, and a disruptions of social conventions.

== Commodification of life ==

=== Animal commodification ===
Commodification of animals is one of the earliest forms of commodification, which can be traced back to the time when domestication of animals began. It includes animal slavery in all forms, including use of animals for food, medicine, fashion and cosmetics, medical research, labor and transport, entertainment, wildlife trade, companionship, and so forth. Scholars say that the commodification of nonhuman animals in food systems is directly linked to capitalist systems that prioritize &quot;monopolistically inclined financial interests&quot; over the well-being of humans, nonhumans, and the environment. Over 200 billion land and aquatic animals are killed every year to provide humans with animal products for consumption, which many scholars and activists have described as an &quot;animal holocaust&quot;. The extensive use of land and other resources for the production of meat instead of grain for human consumption is a leading cause of malnutrition, hunger, and famine around the world.

=== Human commodification ===

Commodification of humans have been discussed in various context, from slavery to surrogacy. Auctions of cricket players by Indian Premier League, Big Bash League and others is also discussed to be a case of human commodification. Virginity auctions are a further example of self-commodification. &quot;Human commodity&quot; is a term used in case of human organ trade, paid surrogacy (also known as commodification of the womb), and human trafficking. According to Gøsta Esping-Andersen, people are commodified or &#x27;turned into objects&#x27; when selling their labour on the market to an employer.

=== Self-commodification ===
Personal information through Social Networking Sites (SNS&#x27;s), such as music purchases, how we identify, and user profiles are aggregated and sold to corporations and businesses for micro targeting, advertising and marketing.

Social media influencers are also a recent examples of self-commodification. A travel blogger is an instance of a mediated micro-celebrity, the social-media influencer, targeting a niche audience interested in visiting exotic locale. Social Media networks expand the reach of this focused audience to make influencing a profitable profession. They commodify themselves by offering online journals, advice, thoughts, experiences along with photographs and videos, then make money by, selling books, self-branding, blog subscriptions, and advertorials. Trust and an increased audience are built by expressing a conversational style, a seemingly real experience by a real person, allowing users connect to the blogger as a friendly voice offering advice on travel choices.

== Commodification of culture ==
A critique of elites in modern societies using media to select aspects of a local culture, repackage and redistribute the alternate view of that culture for profit. Current research include books by: S. Jhally, H.M. Enzensberger, S. Gunster and J. Tunstall. Controversy and disruption occurs when this alternate view is seen as untruthful to the culture that is depicted. Disruptions include misconceptions, sameness, and a focus on entertainment.

=== Commodification of holidays ===
Many holidays such as Christmas, Halloween or Valentine&#x27;s Day have been argued as having become commodified. The commodification of a holiday refers to making celebrations necessarily commercial and based on material goods, like gift giving, elaborate decorations, trick or treating, and card giving. Modern celebrations of many holidays are now more related to the commercial practices and profitable tactics than they are to the holidays&#x27; origins. For some holidays, like Halloween, there are arguments that the commodification of the original holiday turned it into the celebrations that people now love. The commodification of other holidays, like Christmas, sparks arguments about undoing the commercialization and getting back to the intended spirit of the holiday.

=== Commodification of Indigenous cultures ===

American author and feminist bell hooks described the cultural commodification of race and difference as the dominant culture &quot;eating the other&quot;. To hooks, cultural expressions of Otherness, even revolutionary ones, are sold to the dominant culture for their enjoyment. And any messages of social change are not marketed for their messages but used as a mechanism for the dominant ones to acquire a piece of the &quot;primitive&quot;. Any interests in past historical culture almost always have a modern twist. According to Mariana Torgovnick:What is clear now is that the West&#x27;s fascination with the primitive has to do with its own crises in identity, with its own need to clearly demarcate subject and object even while flirting with other ways of experiencing the universe.hooks states that marginalized groups are seduced by this concept because of &quot;the promise of recognition and reconciliation&quot;.When the dominant culture demands that the Other be offered as sign that progressive political change is taking place, that the American Dream can indeed be inclusive of difference, it invites a resurgence of essentialist cultural nationalism.Commodification of indigenous cultures refers to &quot;areas in the life of a community which prior to its penetration by tourism have not been within the domain of economic relations regulated by criteria of market exchange&quot; (Cohen 1988, 372). An example of this type of cultural commodification can be described through viewing the perspective of Hawaiian cultural change since the 1950s. The Hawaiian Luau was once a traditional performance reserved for community members and local people, but through the rise of tourism, this tradition has lost part of its cultural meaning and is now mostly a &quot;for profit&quot; performance.

=== Commodification of love ===
Examples of profiting from love are the myriad &quot;The Bachelor&quot; television shows, and the increase in luxury hotels catering to singles during Valentine&#x27;s weekends.

=== Commodification of media, Internet and online communities ===
Digital commodification occurs when, a business or corporation uses information from an online community without their knowledge, for profit. The commodification of information allows a higher authority to make money rather than a collaborative system of free thoughts. Corporations such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon accelerate and concentrate the commodification of online communities. Digital tracking, like cookies, have further commodified the use of the internet, giving each click, view, or stream, monetary value, even if it is an interaction with free content.

=== Commodification of public goods ===
Public goods are goods for which users cannot be barred from accessing or using them, for failing to pay for them. However, such goods can also be commodified by value addition in the form of products or services or both. Public goods like air and water can be subjected to commodification.
=== Commodification of subcultures ===
Various subcultures have been argued to as having become commodified, for example the goth subculture, the biker subculture, the tattoo subculture, the witchcraft subculture, and others.

=== Commodification of tourism ===
Tourism has been analyzed in the context of commodification as a process of transforming local cultures and heritage into marketable goods. The commodification of tourism removes local culture from the foreground, replacing it with profitability from non-residents. This may be in the form of entertainment, souvenirs, food markets, or others. Tourism leads, in part, to the commodification of indigenous cultures as people return from visits with partial ideas and representations of the culture.

<doc id="550701" wikidata="Q7243371" url="?curid=550701" title="Prime geodesic">
<text>In mathematics, a prime geodesic on a hyperbolic surface is a primitive closed geodesic, i.e. a geodesic which is a closed curve that traces out its image exactly once. Such geodesics are called prime geodesics because, among other things, they obey an asymptotic distribution law similar to the prime number theorem.

==Technical background==
We briefly present some facts from hyperbolic geometry which are helpful in understanding prime geodesics.

===Hyperbolic isometries===
Consider the Poincaré half-plane model &quot;H&quot; of 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Given a Fuchsian group, that is, a discrete subgroup Γ of PSL(2, R), Γ acts on &quot;H&quot; via linear fractional transformation. Each element of PSL(2, R) in fact defines an isometry of &quot;H&quot;, so Γ is a group of isometries of &quot;H&quot;.

There are then 3 types of transformation: hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic. (The loxodromic transformations are not present because we are working with real numbers.) Then an element γ of Γ has 2 distinct real fixed points if and only if γ is hyperbolic. See Classification of isometries and Fixed points of isometries for more details.

===Closed geodesics===
Now consider the quotient surface &quot;M&quot;=Γ\&quot;H&quot;. The following description refers to the upper half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane. This is a hyperbolic surface, in fact, a Riemann surface. Each hyperbolic element &quot;h&quot; of Γ determines a closed geodesic of Γ\&quot;H&quot;: first, by connecting the geodesic semicircle joining the fixed points of &quot;h&quot;, we get a geodesic on &quot;H&quot; called the axis of &quot;h&quot;, and by projecting this geodesic to &quot;M&quot;, we get a geodesic on Γ\&quot;H&quot;.

This geodesic is closed because 2 points which are in the same orbit under the action of Γ project to the same point on the quotient, by definition.

It can be shown that this gives a 1-1 correspondence between closed geodesics on Γ\&quot;H&quot; and hyperbolic conjugacy classes in Γ. The prime geodesics are then those geodesics that trace out their image exactly once — algebraically, they correspond to primitive hyperbolic conjugacy classes, that is, conjugacy classes {γ} such that γ cannot be written as a nontrivial power of another element of Γ.

==Applications of prime geodesics==
The importance of prime geodesics comes from their relationship to other branches of mathematics, especially dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and number theory, as well as Riemann surfaces themselves. These applications often overlap among several different research fields.

===Dynamical systems and ergodic theory===
In dynamical systems, the closed geodesics represent the periodic orbits of the geodesic flow.

===Number theory===
In number theory, various &quot;prime geodesic theorems&quot; have been proved which are very similar in spirit to the prime number theorem. To be specific, we let π(&quot;x&quot;) denote the number of closed geodesics whose norm (a function related to length) is less than or equal to &quot;x&quot;; then π(&quot;x&quot;) ~ &quot;x&quot;/ln(&quot;x&quot;). This result is usually credited to Atle Selberg. In his 1970 Ph.D. thesis, Grigory Margulis proved a similar result for surfaces of variable negative curvature, while in his 1980 Ph.D. thesis, Peter Sarnak proved an analogue of Chebotarev&#x27;s density theorem.

There are other similarities to number theory — error estimates are improved upon, in much the same way that error estimates of the prime number theorem are improved upon. Also, there is a Selberg zeta function which is formally similar to the usual Riemann zeta function and shares many of its properties.

Algebraically, prime geodesics can be lifted to higher surfaces in much the same way that prime ideals in the ring of integers of a number field can be split (factored) in a Galois extension. See Covering map and Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions for more details.

===Riemann surface theory===
Closed geodesics have been used to study Riemann surfaces; indeed, one of Riemann&#x27;s original definitions of the genus of a surface was in terms of simple closed curves. Closed geodesics have been instrumental in studying the eigenvalues of Laplacian operators, arithmetic Fuchsian groups, and Teichmüller spaces.

<doc id="550705" wikidata="Q476388" url="?curid=550705" title="Grumman F8F Bearcat">
<text>The Grumman F8F Bearcat is an American single-engined, carrier-based fighter aircraft introduced in late World War II. It served during the mid-20th century in the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, and the air forces of other nations. It was Grumman Aircraft&#x27;s last piston-engined fighter aircraft. Adapted versions of the Bearcat have broken speed records for piston-engined aircraft. Today, the Bearcat is popular among warbird owners and air racers.

==Design and development==

===Concept===
The Bearcat concept began during a meeting between Battle of Midway veteran F4F Wildcat pilots and Grumman vice president Jake Swirbul at Pearl Harbor on 23 June 1942. At the meeting, Lieutenant Commander Jimmie Thach emphasized one of the most important requirements in a good fighter plane was &quot;climb rate&quot;.

Climb performance is strongly related to the power-to-weight ratio, and is maximized by wrapping the smallest and lightest possible airframe around the most powerful engine. Another goal was that the G-58 (Grumman&#x27;s design designation for the aircraft) should be able to operate from escort carriers, which were then limited to the obsolescent F4F Wildcat, as the Grumman F6F Hellcat was too large and heavy. A small, lightweight aircraft would make this possible. After intensively analyzing carrier warfare in the Pacific Theater of Operations for a year and a half, Grumman began development of the G-58 Bearcat in late 1943.

===Design===
In 1943, Grumman was introducing the F6F Hellcat, powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 engine, which provided . The R-2800 was the most powerful American engine, so it would be retained for the G-58. This meant that improved performance would have to come from a lighter airframe.

To meet this goal, the Bearcat&#x27;s fuselage was about shorter than the Hellcat, and was cut down vertically behind the cockpit. This allowed the use of a bubble canopy, the first to be fitted to a US Navy fighter. The vertical stabilizer was the same height as the Hellcat&#x27;s, but had an increased aspect ratio, giving it a thinner look. The wingspan was less than the Hellcat&#x27;s. Structurally, the fuselage used flush riveting and spot welding, with a heavy-gauge 302W aluminum alloy skin suitable for carrier landings. Armor protection was provided for the pilot, engine, and oil cooler.

The Hellcat used a , three-bladed Hamilton Standard propeller. A slight reduction in size was made by moving to a Aeroproducts four-bladed propeller. Keeping the prop clear of the deck required long landing gear, which, combined with the shortened fuselage, gave the Bearcat a significant &quot;nose-up&quot; profile on land. The hydraulically operated undercarriage used an articulated trunnion that extended the length of the oleo legs when lowered; as the undercarriage retracted, the legs were shortened, enabling them to fit into a wheel well, which was entirely in the wing. An additional benefit of the inward-retracting units was a wide track, which helped counter propeller torque on takeoff and gave the F8F good ground and carrier deck handling.

The design team had set the goal that the G-58 should weigh fully loaded. As development continued, this was found to be impossible to achieve, as the structure of the new fighter had to be made strong enough for aircraft carrier landings. Weight-saving measures included restricting the internal fuel capacity to and limiting the fixed armament to four .50 cal Browning M2/AN machine guns, two in each wing.(later ) The limited range due to the reduced fuel load meant it would be useful in the interception role, but the Hellcat would still be needed for longer range patrols. A later role was defending the fleet against &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. Compared to the Hellcat, the Bearcat was 20% lighter, had a 30% better rate of climb, and was faster.

Another weight-saving concept the designers found was detachable wingtips. The wings were designed to fold at a point about out along the span, reducing the space taken up on the carrier. Normally, the hinge system would have to be built very strong to transmit loads from the outer portions of the wing to the main spar in the inner section, which adds considerable weight. Instead of building the entire wing to be able to withstand high-g loads, only the inner portion of the wing was able to do this. The outer portions were more lightly constructed, and designed to snap off at the hinge line if the force exceeded 7.5 g. In this case, the aircraft would still be flyable and could be repaired after returning to the carrier. This saved .

===Prototypes===
The design was completed in November 1943 and an order for two prototypes was placed on 27 November 1943 under the BuAir designation XF8F-1. The first prototype flew on 21 August 1944, only nine months after the design effort started. The initial flight test demonstrated a climb rate and a top speed of . Compared to the Vought F4U Corsair, the Bearcat was marginally slower, but more maneuverable and climbed more quickly.

Testing demonstrated a number of problems, notably a lack of horizontal stability, an underpowered trim system, landing gear that could be extended only at slow speeds, an unreliable airspeed indicator, and a cramped cockpit. The test pilots also requested that six guns be installed. The stability problem was addressed on the second prototype by adding a triangular fillet to the front of the vertical stabilizer. The extra guns could not be incorporated due to weight and balance considerations.

===Production===
The Navy placed a production contract for 2,023 aircraft based on the second prototype on 6 October 1944. On 5 February 1945, they awarded another contract for 1,876 slightly modified aircraft from General Motors&#x27;Eastern Aircraft Division, given the designation F3M-1. These differed primarily in having the R-2800-34W engine and a small increase in fuel capacity.

Deliveries from Grumman began on 21 May 1945. The end of the war led to the Grumman order being reduced to 770 examples, with the GM contract being cancelled outright. An additional order was placed for 126 F8F-1Bs replacing the .50 cal machine guns with the 20 mm M2 cannon, the US version of the widely used Hispano-Suiza HS.404. Fifteen of these were later modified as F8F-1N night fighters with an APS-19 radar mounted under the starboard wing.

An unmodified production F8F-1 set a 1946 time-to-climb record (after a run of ) of in 94 seconds (). The Bearcat held this record for 10 years until it was broken by a jet fighter (which still could not match the Bearcat&#x27;s short takeoff distance).

In 1948, Grumman introduced a number of improvements to produce the F8F-2. Among the changes were a modified cowling design, taller vertical fin, and the slightly more powerful R-2800-30W engine producing . In total, 293 F8F-2s were produced, along with 12 F8F-2N night fighters and 60 F8F-2P reconnaissance versions. Production ended in 1949, and the first units began to convert off the type that year. The last Bearcats were withdrawn in 1952.

==Operational history==
===United States===
The F8F prototypes were ordered in November 1943 and first flew on 21 August 1944, a mere nine months later. The first production aircraft was delivered in February 1945 and the first squadron, Fighter Squadron 19 (VF-19), was operational by 21 May 1945, but World War II was over before the aircraft saw combat service.

One problem that became evident in service was the snap-off wingtips not working as expected. While they worked well under carefully controlled conditions in flight and on the ground, in the field, where aircraft were repetitively stressed by landing on carriers and since the wings were slightly less carefully made in the factories, a possibility arose that only one wingtip would break away with the possibility of the aircraft crashing. This was replaced with an explosives system to blow the wingtips off together, which also worked well, but this ended when a ground technician died due to an accidental triggering. In the end, the wings were reinforced, and the aircraft was limited to 7.5 g.

Postwar, the F8F became a major U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps fighter, equipping 24 fighter squadrons in the Navy and a smaller number in the Marines. Often mentioned as one of the best-handling piston-engined fighters ever built, its performance was sufficient to outperform some early jets. Its capability for aerobatic performance is illustrated by its selection as the second demonstration aircraft for the Navy&#x27;s elite Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron in 1946, replacing the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The Blue Angels flew the Bearcat until the team was temporarily disbanded in 1950 during the Korean War and pressed into operational combat service. The F9F Panther and McDonnell F2H Banshee largely replaced the Bearcat as their performance and other advantages eclipsed piston-engined fighters.

=== France and South Vietnam ===

The first combat for the F8F Bearcat was during the French Indochina War (1946–1954), when nearly 200 Bearcats were delivered to the French forces in 1951.

When the war ended in 1954 and French forces withdrew, 28 surviving Bearcats were donated to South Vietnam, and served with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force from 1956. The Vietnamese Bearcats were retired from 1960 onwards, replaced with Douglas A-1 Skyraiders and North American T-28 Trojans as the Vietnam War (1957–1975) continued.

===Thailand===
F8Fs were also supplied to Thailand during the late 1940s.

==Air racing==
Bearcats have long been popular in air racing. A stock Bearcat flown by Mira Slovak and sponsored by Bill Stead won the first Reno Air Race in 1964. &quot;Rare Bear&quot;, a highly modified F8F owned by Lyle Shelton, went on to dominate the event for decades, often competing with Daryl Greenamyer, another famous racer with victories in his own Bearcat (&quot;Conquest I&quot;, now at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum) and holder of a piston-engined aircraft world speed record in it. &quot;Rare Bear&quot; also set many performance records, including the 3 km World Speed Record for piston-driven aircraft (), set in 1989, and a new time-to-climb record ( in 91.9 seconds (), set in 1972, breaking the 1946 record cited above).

Bishamon is portrayed holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand, the latter symbolizing the divine treasure house, whose contents he both guards and gives away. In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Seven Lucky Gods.

Bishamon is also called Tamonten (多聞天 lit. &quot;listening to many teachings&quot;) because he is seen as the guardian of the places where the Buddha preaches. He is believed to live halfway down Mount Sumeru. He is also associated with Hachiman. Especially in the &quot;Shingon tradition&quot; that gives some place and worth to this hybrid character of Bishamon although most Mahayana temples have Bishamon and his counterpart as guardians at the entrance gate.

==In Tibet==
In Tibet, is considered a lokapāla or dharmapāla in the retinue of Ratnasambhava. He is also known as the King of the North. As guardian of the north, he is often depicted on temple murals outside the main door. He is also thought of as a god of wealth. As such, is sometimes portrayed carrying a citron, the fruit of the &quot;jambhara&quot; tree, a pun on another name of his, Jambhala. The fruit helps distinguish him iconically from depictions of Kuvera. He is sometimes represented as corpulent and covered with jewels. When shown seated, his right foot is generally pendant and supported by a lotus-flower on which is a conch shell. His mount is a snow lion. Tibetan Buddhists consider Jambhala&#x27;s sentiment regarding wealth to be providing freedom by way of bestowing prosperity, so that one may focus on the path or spirituality rather than on the materiality and temporality of that wealth.

== In Thailand ==
In Thailand, he resolves the dispute that arose in the legend of Nang Ai and Phadaeng. At Wat Chulamanee temple in Samut Songkhram Province, there is a huge statue of him that is very popular in worship, until becoming a phenomenon in the early 2022.

In addition, Vaiśravaṇa also appears as the Seal of Udon Thani Province. According to the myth, Udon Thani is on the north direction, which is the resident of guardian of the north or Vaiśravaṇa.

==In popular culture==
The 2011 manga &quot;Noragami&quot;, which revolves around Japanese mythology, depicts this deity&#x27;s Japanese iteration Bishamonten as a lady possessing similar traits and equipped with modern weapons.

In the anime Record of Ragnarok, Bishamonten also made a depiction as a fighter of the Ragnarok, representing the Gods.

In the &quot;Touhou Project&quot; video game series, Shou Toramaru, a tiger yōkai, serves as a physical avatar of Bishamonten. She has the ability to gather treasures and create gemstones with her jeweled pagoda, reflecting Bishamonten&#x27;s status as one of the Seven Lucky Gods.

<text>Multisystem developmental disorder (MSDD) is a term used by Stanley Greenspan to describe children under age 3 who exhibit signs of impaired communication as in autism, but with strong emotional attachments atypical of autism. It is described in the DC:0-3R manual as an optional diagnosis for children under two years of age.

==Other uses of the term==
The term &quot;multisystem developmental disorder&quot; has also been used to describe various developmental disorders. These include:
*Alagille syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with a wide range of features and manifestations. Its five most significant features are chronic cholestasis, a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum, occurring in 95% of cases; heart abnormalities (over 90%); butterfly vertebrae; posterior embryotoxon and a distinctive face (prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a pointed chin).
*Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a syndrome characterized by broad thumbs, facial abnormalities, and big toes alongside moderate to severe intellectual disability. 
*Williams syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a unique profile of strengths and deficits; most with the condition have mild intellectual disability but have grammatical and lexical abilities above what would be expected from their IQs. They are hypersocial and empathetic, but social isolation is commonly experienced. 
*Proteus syndrome, a congenital disorder causing disproportionate growth of skin, bone, and other tissues. 
*Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia, an autosomal recessive skeletal disorder with an estimated prevalence of between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 130,000 live births.

== Symptoms ==
*Toe walking 
*Pragmatic speech problems
*Clumsiness
*Obsessions and rituals
*Sensory issues
*Disinterest in social interaction
*Autistic characteristics

<text>The Basel Dove (Basel German: &quot;Basler Dybli&quot;, ) is a notable stamp issued by the Swiss canton of Basel on 1 July 1845 with a value of 2½-rappen. It was the first tricolor stamp in the world and the only postage stamp issued by Basel. At the time each canton was responsible for its own postal service. There were no uniform postal rates for Switzerland until after the establishment of a countrywide postal service on 1 January 1849. The only other cantons to issue their own stamps were Zürich and Geneva.

The stamp, designed by the architect Melchior Berri, featured a white embossed dove carrying a letter in its beak, and was inscribed &quot;STADT POST BASEL&quot;. The stamp is printed in black, crimson and blue, making it the world&#x27;s first tri-coloured stamp. It was valid for use until 30 September 1854, by which time 41,480 stamps had been printed.

<doc id="550718" wikidata="Q285467" url="?curid=550718" title="Olympic Stadium (Montreal)">
<text>Olympic Stadium (, ) is a multi-purpose stadium in Montreal, Canada, located at Olympic Park in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district of the city. Built in the mid-1970s as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, it is nicknamed &quot;The Big O&quot;, a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium&#x27;s roof. It is also disparagingly referred to as &quot;The Big Owe&quot; in reference to the high cost of its construction and of hosting the 1976 Olympics as a whole.

The stadium is one of the largest by seating capacity in Canada. After the Olympics, artificial turf was installed and it became the home of Montreal&#x27;s professional baseball and football teams. The Montreal Alouettes of the CFL returned to their previous home of Molson Stadium in 1998 for regular season games, but continued to use Olympic Stadium for playoff and Grey Cup games until 2012. Following the 2004 baseball season, the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals. The stadium currently serves as a multi-purpose facility for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) with a permanent seating capacity of 56,040. The capacity is expandable with temporary seating. CF Montréal (formerly known as Montreal Impact) of Major League Soccer (MLS) has used the venue when demand for tickets justifies the large capacity or when the weather restricts outdoor play at nearby Saputo Stadium in the spring months.

The stadium has not had a main tenant since the Expos left in 2004. Despite decades of use, the stadium&#x27;s history of numerous structural and financial problems has largely branded it as a white elephant.

Incorporated into the north base of the stadium, inclined at 45°, and not completed until a full decade after the stadium&#x27;s opening, is the Montreal Tower. At it is the world&#x27;s tallest inclined tower. The stadium and Olympic Park grounds border Maisonneuve Park, which includes the Montreal Botanical Garden, adjacent to the west across Sherbrooke Street (Route 138).

== History ==

=== Background and architecture ===

As early as 1963, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau sought to build a covered stadium in Montreal. A covered stadium was thought to be all but essential for Drapeau&#x27;s other goal of bringing a Major League Baseball team to Montreal, given the cold weather that can affect the city in April, October and sometimes even September. In 1967, soon after the National League granted Montreal an expansion franchise for 1969, Drapeau wrote a letter promising that any prospective Montreal team would be playing in a covered stadium by 1971. However, even though Quebec mayors have broad executive power, Drapeau could not make such a guarantee on his own authority. Just as Charles Bronfman, who was slated to become the franchise&#x27;s first owner, was ready to walk away, Drapeau had his staffers draw up a proposal for a stadium. It was enough to persuade Bronfman to continue with the effort.
The stadium was designed by French architect Roger Taillibert to be an elaborate facility featuring a retractable roof, which was to be opened and closed by cables suspended from a huge tower – the tallest inclined structure in the world, and the tenth tallest structure in Montreal. The design of the stadium has been likened to that of the Australian Pavilion at Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka, Japan, although Taillibert had previously explored the concept of an umbrella-style roof for a theatre in Cannes (1964) and Piscine Carnot in Paris (1967). Soon after Montreal was awarded the 1976 Games, Drapeau struck a secret deal with Taillibert to build the stadium. It only came to light in 1972.

The Olympic swimming pool is located under this tower. An Olympic velodrome (since converted to the Montreal Biodome, an indoor nature museum) was situated at the base of the tower in a building similar in design to the swimming pool. The building was built as the main stadium for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium was host to various events including the opening and closing ceremonies, athletics, football finals, and the team jumping equestrian events.

The building&#x27;s design is cited as a masterpiece of Organic Modern architecture. Taillibert based the building on plant and animal forms, aiming to include vertebral structures with sinews or tentacles, while still following the basic plans of Modern architecture.

=== Construction ===
The stadium was originally slated to be finished in 1972, but the grand opening was cancelled due to a strike by construction workers. The &quot;Conseil des métiers de la construction&quot; union headed by André &quot;Dédé&quot; Desjardins kept the construction site in &quot;anarchic disorder&quot; until the Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa bought him off in a secret deal. In his 2000 book &quot;Notre Cher Stade Olympique&quot;, Taillibert wrote &quot;If the Olympic Games took place, it was thanks to Dédé Desjardins. What irony!&quot; Further delays ensued due to the stadium&#x27;s unusual design and Taillibert&#x27;s unwillingness to back down from his original vision of the stadium even in the face of escalating costs for raw materials. It did not help that the original project manager, Trudeau et Associés, seemed to be incapable of handling some of the most basic construction tasks. In 1974, the Quebec provincial government lost patience with the delays and cost overruns and fired Taillibert from the project.

Additionally, the project was plagued by circumstances beyond anyone&#x27;s control. Work slowed to a snail&#x27;s pace for a third of the year due to Montreal&#x27;s typically brutal winters. As a result, the stadium and tower remained unfinished at the opening of the 1976 Olympic Games.

The roof materials languished in a warehouse in Marseille until 1982, and the tower and roof were not completed until 1987. It would be another year before the 66-tonne, Kevlar roof (designed and built by Lavalin) could retract. Even then, it could not be used in winds above . Ultimately, it was only opened and closed 88 times.

=== Observatory ===
When construction on the stadium&#x27;s tower resumed after the 1976 Olympics, a multi-storey observatory was added to the plan, accessible via an inclined elevator, opened in 1987, that travels along the curved tower&#x27;s spine. The elevator cabin ascends from base of the tower to the upper deck in less than two minutes at a rate of , with space for 76 persons per trip and a capacity of 500 persons per hour. The cabin is designed to remain level throughout its trip, while providing a panoramic view to its passengers.

The elevator faces north-east, offering a view to the north, south and east. It overlooks the Olympic Village, the Biodome, the Botanical Gardens and Saputo Stadium. The Olympic Park, the stadium&#x27;s suspended roof and downtown Montreal can be viewed from the south-west-facing Observatory at the top of the tower.

=== Stadium financing ===
Despite initial projections in 1970 that the stadium would cost only C$134 million to construct, strikes and construction delays served to escalate these costs. By the time the stadium opened (in an unfinished form), the total costs had risen to C$1.1 billion.

The Quebec government introduced a special tobacco tax in May 1976 to help recoup its investment. By 2006, the amount contributed to the stadium&#x27;s owner, the Olympic Installations Board (OIB) (fr: Régie des Installations Olympiques), accounted for 8% of the tax revenue earned from cigarette sales. The 1976 special tobacco tax act stipulated that once the stadium was paid off, ownership of the facility would be returned to the City of Montreal.

In mid-November 2006, the stadium&#x27;s costs were finally paid in full, more than 30 years after it opened.
The total expenditure (including repairs, renovations, construction, interest, and inflation) amounted to C$1.61 billion, making it—at the time all costs were paid off—the second most expensive stadium built (after Wembley Stadium in London). Despite initial plans to complete payment in October 2006, an indoor smoking ban introduced in May 2006 curtailed the revenue gathered by the tobacco tax. By 2014, the stadium&#x27;s expense ranking had fallen to fifth, with the construction of costlier venues like MetLife Stadium, AT&amp;T Stadium, and the new Yankee Stadium. Perceived by many to be a white elephant, the stadium has also been dubbed &quot;The Big Owe&quot; due to its astronomical cost.

The stadium has generated on average $20 million in revenue each year since 1977. It is estimated that a large-scale event such as the Grey Cup can generate as much as $50 million in revenue.

=== Continuing problems ===

Although the tower and retractable roof were not completed in time for the 1976 Olympics, construction on the tower resumed in the 1980s. During this period, however, a large fire set the tower ablaze, causing damage and forcing a scheduled Expos home game to be postponed. In 1986, a large chunk of the tower fell onto the playing field prior to another Expos game August 29 vs. San Diego Padres forcing a doubleheader on August 30.

In January 1985, approval was given by the Quebec government to complete the project and install a retractable roof, financed by an Olympic cigarette tax in the province. The tower construction and installation of the orange-coloured Kevlar roof were completed by April 1987, a decade later than planned. The roof experienced numerous rips, allowing rain to leak into the stadium.

As part of various renovations made in 1991 to improve the stadium&#x27;s suitability as a baseball venue, 12,000 seats were eliminated, most of them in distant portions of the outfield, and home plate was moved closer to the stands.
On September 8 of that year, support beams snapped and caused a concrete slab to fall onto an exterior walkway. No one was injured, but the Expos had to move their final 13 home games of that season to the opponents&#x27; cities. The Expos hinted that the 1992 season was at risk unless the stadium was certified safe. In early November, engineers found the stadium was structurally sound. However, it took longer to certify the roof as safe because it had been badly ripped in a June windstorm. For the 1992 season, it was decided to keep the roof closed at all times. The Kevlar roof was removed in May 1998, making the stadium open-air for the 1998 season. Later in 1998, a $26 million non-retractable opaque blue roof was installed.

In 1999, a portion of the roof collapsed on January 18, dumping ice and snow on workers that were setting up for the annual Montreal Auto Show. The auto show and a boat show the following month were cancelled, and the auto show left the venue for good (since then, the Montreal Auto Show has usually been held at the Palais des congrès de Montréal). Repaired once again, the roof was modified to better withstand winter conditions: the OIB installed a network of pipes to circulate heated water under the roof to allow for snow melting. Despite these corrective measures, the stadium floor remained closed from December to March.
Birdair, the fabric provider and designer of the roof, was later sued for the roof failure. The installer of the roof, Danny&#x27;s Construction, having suffered tremendous cost overruns along with its subcontractor Montacier, due to changes in the plans and specifications and delays, was terminated during the construction, and Birdair completed the project. Danny&#x27;s Construction sued Birdair in 1999. In February 2010, after a lengthy trial, the Quebec Superior Court awarded a judgement in favour of Danny&#x27;s Construction and dismissed Birdair&#x27;s countersuit.

The stadium&#x27;s condition suffered considerably in the early 21st century. During the Expos&#x27; final years in Montreal, it was coated with grime, and much of the concrete was chipped, stained, and soiled.

=== Plans for a third roof ===

In 2009, the stadium received approval to remain open in the winter, provided weather conditions are favourable. However, the Olympic Installations Board issued a report stating that the roof was unsafe during heavy rainfall or more than of snow, and that it rips 50 to 60 times a year. The city fire department warned in August 2009 that without corrective measures, including a new roof, it may order the stadium closed. Events cannot be held if more than of snow are predicted 24 hours in advance, such as caused postponement of the Montreal Impact home opener soccer match in March 2014. A contract for a new permanent steel roof was awarded in 2004, with an estimated $300 million price tag. In June 2010, the Olympic Installations Board sought approval from the provincial government for the contract.
In May 2011 a committee was formed to study the future of the stadium and improve the usage of the stadium, pool, and sports centre.

A slab of concrete measuring approximately fell from the roof of the stadium&#x27;s underground parking facility on March 4, 2012. There were no injuries. The roof continues to deteriorate, with 7,453 tears as of May 2017,
limiting use of the venue in winter to when there are three or fewer centimetres of snow on the roof.

In 2015, a new high definition scoreboard was installed, replacing the aging two-panel display dating back to the stadium&#x27;s renovations in 1992.

In November 2017, the Quebec government approved a new roof, estimated to cost $250 million. The new roof was then planned to be removable, allowing the stadium to either be open-air or enclosed, consistent with the intent of the original roof. The option of a removable portion of the roof has since been removed from the scope of the project.
The Olympic Installations Board has estimated the cost of demolishing the stadium would be between $500 and $700 million,
though this figure is based on a preliminary two-month study and thus has a high margin of error. The high cost of demolition is due to the stadium being built of pre-stressed concrete, which rules out a controlled implosion or wrecking ball, and instead would require carefully removing the rebar wire which is under tension.

In February 2024, Quebec Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx announced that the expected cost of the new roof had increased to $870 million. She said the new roof will take four years to construct, and is expected to last for 50 years. She said demolition of the stadium is &quot;unthinkable&quot; and not an option, for multiple reasons: the structure is an icon of Quebec, Montreal&#x27;s Metro runs directly beneath the stadium, multiple businesses lease space in the office tower, and demolition would cost an estimated $2 billion. However, &quot;Le Journal de Montréal &quot; reported that the number was inflated, and demolition would cost only a small fraction of that amount. In addition, they reported that the cited cost for the new roof did not include hundreds of millions of dollars in additional work necessary to correct acoustics and remodel seats and restrooms.

== Post-Olympic use ==

=== Gridiron football ===
The Canadian Football League&#x27;s Montreal Alouettes became the stadium&#x27;s first major post-Olympic tenant when they moved their home games there halfway through the 1976 season. Capacity was reduced from its Olympic capacity of 72,000 to 58,500, but leapt to 66,308 when the natural grass was replaced with AstroTurf ahead of the 1977 season. The Alouettes remained there through 1986, the franchise&#x27;s final season of operations; the team would shut down shortly after the start of the 1987 season. A revived Alouettes franchise returned for the 1996 and 1997 seasons, but then moved to the Percival Molson Stadium in 1998. The Alouettes used Olympic Stadium for select regular season games until 2009, and playoff games until 2012. Due to the increased popularity of the Alouettes and the small capacity of Percival Molson Stadium, the team considered returning to Olympic Stadium on a full-time basis, but instead renovated Percival Molson Stadium to increase its capacity. In addition, the stadium holds the record for the largest Grey Cup attendance, that of the 1977 Grey Cup game, in which the hometown Montreal Alouettes defeated the Edmonton Eskimos, 41-6 before 68,318 spectators; this despite a local transit strike and harsh winter weather conditions.

Olympic Stadium has hosted the Grey Cup a total of six times, most recently in 2008 when the Calgary Stampeders defeated the hometown Alouettes. The stadium holds the record for nine of the ten largest crowds in CFL history, which include five regular-season and four Grey Cup games. A single-game record crowd numbering 69,083 attended a game played on September 6, 1977, between the Alouettes and Toronto Argonauts.

In 1991 and 1992, the stadium was the home of the Montreal Machine of the World League of American Football. This included hosting World Bowl &#x27;92 on June 6, 1992, in which the Sacramento Surge defeated the Orlando Thunder 21–17 before 43,789.

In 1988 (Jets and Browns) and 1990 (Steelers and Patriots), NFL pre-season games were played at Olympic Stadium.

=== Baseball ===
In 1977, the stadium replaced Jarry Park Stadium as the home ballpark of the National League&#x27;s Montreal Expos. As a part of the team&#x27;s franchise grant, a domed stadium was supposed to be in place for the 1972 baseball season. However, due to the delays in constructing Olympic Stadium, until 1977, the Expos annually sought and received a waiver to remain at Jarry. As late as January 1977, it was thought the Expos would have to play at least part of the 1977 season at Jarry as well. The Parti Québécois&#x27; landslide victory in the 1976 provincial elections caused the Expos to break off lease talks. However, an agreement was reached in February, and an official announcement came in March.

The Expos regularly played 81 home games every season until 2003, when they played 22 home games in Puerto Rico at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. The Expos played 59 home games at Olympic Stadium in each of their final two seasons of 2003 and 2004; the franchise moved south to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season and became the Washington Nationals.

Olympic Stadium&#x27;s first baseball game was played on April 15, 1977. In front of 57,592, the Expos lost 7–2 to the Philadelphia Phillies. However, the Expos had to use a hacksaw to cut open the locks because the OIB did not have a master key. The Expos played five home playoff games in 1981; two in the NLDS against the Phillies, and three in the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who went on to win the World Series. On October 19, the Expos lost the decisive fifth game, 2–1, to the Dodgers on Rick Monday&#x27;s ninth-inning home run. In 1982, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Olympic Stadium in front of 59,057—a stadium record for baseball. On September 29, 2004, the Expos played their last game in Montreal, losing 9–1 to the Florida Marlins before 31,395.
Olympic Stadium proved to be somewhat problematic as a baseball venue. As in all multipurpose stadiums, the lower seating tier was set further back than in baseball-specific parks to accommodate the football field. However, since Canadian football fields are longer and wider than American football fields, Olympic Stadium&#x27;s lower tier was set back even further than comparable seats at American multipurpose stadiums. The upper deck was one of the highest in the majors; as was the case with most of its multipurpose counterparts, most of the upper-deck seats, particularly those in the outfield, were too far away to be of any use during the regular season.

The Expos were not consulted on the stadium&#x27;s location, design, or construction even though they were slated to be its primary tenants. Nonetheless, for most of their tenure they put considerable effort into making the atmosphere friendlier for baseball. During the 1970s and early 1980s, fans arriving at the stadium from the Metro were greeted by an oom-pah band playing &quot;The Happy Wanderer.&quot; Whenever an opposing pitcher tried to hold a runner at first rather than pitch, the sound system would cluck at him like a chicken.

Before the 1991 season, the OIB began a major overhaul on the stadium&#x27;s baseball configuration. The lower deck in centre field was removed to make room for a larger scoreboard with replay capability. That scoreboard was installed ahead of the 1992 season. Also ahead of the 1992 season, the running track was removed, home plate was moved closer to the stands and new seats closer to the field were installed. Several distant sections of permanent seating beyond the outfield fence were closed, replaced with bleacher seats directly behind the fence. The total seating capacity for baseball was reduced from a high of around 60,400 to 46,000.

The Expos were very successful in the stadium for a time, with above National League median attendance in 1977 and from 1979 to 1983. The Expos outdrew the New York Mets from 1977 to 1983, and 1994 to 1996, as well as the New York Yankees in 1982 and 1983.

The stadium&#x27;s playing conditions left much to be desired. For most of the Expos&#x27; tenure, the playing surface was an extremely thin AstroTurf carpet, with only equally thin padding between it and the concrete floor. It was so hard on players&#x27; knees that visiting teams frequently ran at a nearby park. Longtime Expos trainer Ron McClain begged for a replacement, but the OIB was unwilling to spend the $1 million needed for a new surface. Before the roof finally arrived, players had to contend with huge patches of ice in early April or late September. Additionally, for most of the Expos&#x27; tenure, the padding on the fence was so thin that fielders risked severe injury by going after long fly balls. However, the OIB was also unwilling to replace the padding. By the 1990s, several free agents specifically demanded that the Expos be taken out of consideration due to the poor playing conditions.

By the mid-1990s, owner Claude Brochu concluded that Olympic Stadium was not suitable as a baseball venue, and actively campaigned for a replacement. Brochu sold the team to Jeffrey Loria in 2000, who was equally dissatisfied with Olympic Stadium; he bluntly stated, &quot;We cannot stay here.&quot; However, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard refused to authorize public funding deemed necessary for a replacement, in part because Olympic Stadium still had not been paid for. The poor conditions played a role in the Expos nearly being disbanded in the 2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan, which fell through due to court rulings.

Ten years after the last Expos game at Olympic Stadium, the Toronto Blue Jays played two spring training games at the stadium against the New York Mets on March 28 and 29, 2014, with combined attendance of 96,350. The Jays would continue this practice for the next 5 years: against the Cincinnati Reds on April 3 and 4, 2015, with combined attendance of 96,545, the Boston Red Sox on April 1 and 2, 2016, with combined attendance of 106,102, the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 31 and April 1, 2017, combined attendance of 95,382, the St. Louis Cardinals on March 26 and 27, 2018, with combined attendance of 51,151 and the Milwaukee Brewers on March 25 and 26, 2019, with a combined attendance of 46,984. The New York Yankees were scheduled to play there on March 23 and 24, 2020; however, the games were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. No further games have been scheduled since, ending baseball spring training at the Montreal Olympic Stadium.

==== Longest home runs ====

Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit the longest home run at Olympic Stadium on May 20, 1978, driving the ball into the second deck in right field for an estimated distance of 535 feet. The yellow seat that marked the location where the ball landed has been removed from the 300 level (a new yellow marker seat was placed in 2015). The seat is now preserved at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Stargell also hit a notable home run at the Expos&#x27; original Montreal home, Jarry Park, which landed in a swimming pool beyond the right field fence.

On April 4, 1988, the Expos&#x27; Opening Day, Darryl Strawberry of the New York Mets hit a ball off a speaker which hangs off a concrete ring at Olympic Stadium, estimated to have travelled 525 feet.

Henry Rodríguez hit a ball on June 15, 1997, that bounced off the concrete ring in right field, caromed up to hit the roof, and came down, hitting a speaker. The distance travelled by this ball is also estimated at 525 feet.

The longest home run hit to left field was Vladimir Guerrero&#x27;s blast on July 28, 2003, that hit an advertising sign directly below the left field upper deck. The ad was later replaced with a sign reading &quot;VLAD 502&quot;.

=== Soccer ===
The Olympic Stadium was the home of the NASL&#x27;s Montreal Manic soccer team from 1981 to 1983. A 1981 playoff game against the Chicago Sting attracted a crowd of over 58,000. Several games of the 2007 FIFA Under 20 World Cup were played at Olympic Stadium and drew the largest crowds of the tournament, including two sell-outs of 55,800.

Olympic Stadium hosted a CONCACAF Champions League quarter-final game pitting the original Montreal Impact – who played primarily in the adjacent Saputo Stadium – against Club Santos Laguna of the Liga MX (Mexico First Division) on February 25, 2009. This was the first time an international soccer game took place in Montreal during the winter months. The Impact won 2–0 in front of a record crowd of 55,571. The stadium was also home to a friendly match between the Impact and A.C. Milan of the Italian Serie A on June 2, 2010, before 47,861.

On July 25, 2009, Olympic Stadium became the first stadium outside France to host Ligue 1&#x27;s Trophée des Champions, a super cup played by the winner of Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France. Over 34,000 attended the game. Bordeaux defeated Guingamp, 2–0. The game was held in Montreal to help Ligue 1 break into the growing North America soccer market.

On March 17, 2012, a record crowd of 58,912 packed Olympic Stadium to cheer on the current version of the Montreal Impact for their MLS debut on home soil, in an entertaining 1–1 draw with the Chicago Fire, setting a new attendance record for professional soccer in Quebec. That record was later broken on May 12, 2012, with 60,860 people for a match against the LA Galaxy, also setting a new attendance record for professional soccer in Canada.

On August 24, 2014, the Olympic Stadium hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

On April 29, 2015, a record crowd of 61,004 attended the final match of the CONCACAF Champions League between the Montreal Impact and Club América, establishing a new record attendance for professional soccer in Canada.

The Olympic Stadium hosted tournament matches for the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup along with other stadiums across Canada. One notable game was the semi-final match-up between the United States and Germany that took place on June 30, 2015, which drew a crowd of 51,176 people. The Americans won 2–0 in front of a largely partisan crowd and then went on to win their record third FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup trophy the following Sunday in Vancouver. This stadium was originally one of Canada&#x27;s three candidate venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and was expected to get a retractable roof. However, Montreal withdrew from the host city selection process for the World Cup on July 6, 2021.

=== Office space ===

Starting in 2018, the Desjardins Group plans to move approximately 1000 of its employees into the Montreal Tower. The company plans to occupy 7 of the 12 floors available in the tower. It is estimated that around $60 million in renovations are required before Desjardins can move in.

=== Other ===

In winter 1977, Emerson, Lake and Palmer filmed a performance of their arrangement of the Aaron Copland piece &quot;Fanfare For The Common Man&quot; at the stadium. The group also recorded a concert at the stadium in August of that year and released it as a live album.

Olympic Stadium hosted the 1978 World Junior Speed Skating Championships where they crowned the American siblings Eric and Beth Heiden as junior world champions.

In August 1979 the Olympic Stadium hosted the 1979 IAAF World Cup in Athletics.

The Catholic Charismatic Renewal Assembly took place in the presence of Father Emiliano Tardif in 1979.

On June 20, 1980, Roberto Durán defeated Sugar Ray Leonard to win the WBC boxing world&#x27;s welterweight championship at the Olympic Stadium.

The Drum Corps International World Championship finals were held at this arena in 1981 and 1982.

On September 11, 1984, Pope John Paul II participated in a youth rally with about 55,000 people in attendance.


On October 30, 2010, a special mass, to commemorate the ascension to sainthood of Brother André, was held at the stadium. Over 30,000 people attended.

In 2017, the venue was the site of the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships.

In 2021, the Olympic Stadium was named a mass vaccination site by the Quebec government during the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, making it one of the largest mass vaccination sites in the province as a result. Quebec premier François Legault received both of his required vaccine doses as well as his booster dose at the stadium.

=== 1992 concert riot ===

On August 8, 1992, Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses co-headlined a North American Stadium tour Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour with an included stop at Olympic Stadium. Several songs into Metallica&#x27;s set, during the song &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, frontman and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield was accidentally burned by improper pyrotechnics forcing the band to cut their set short as Hetfield was rushed to the hospital. Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Jason Newsted and drummer Lars Ulrich promised a makeup concert to quell the sold-out crowd of 54,666. The band would later perform two half-priced shows at the Montreal Forum in February 1993. After a two-hour and fifteen-minute delay, Guns N&#x27; Roses performed a shortened set. Singer Axl Rose later blamed the issues on bad audio and vocal problems. Following the set, an estimated crowd of 2,000 people began rioting within the stadium and surrounding areas. The fans overturned police cars and set multiple bonfires within the stadium, causing an estimated $600,000 in damage to the stadium and surrounding areas. The Expos&#x27; schedule was unaffected by the repairs made to the stadium, as they had been on a seven-game away stretch. The Régie banned Guns N&#x27; Roses for life from the venue.

Metallica returned to the Olympic Stadium on August 11 and 13, 2023, performing for the first time since the events as part of their M72 world tour.

=== Attendance record ===

Pink Floyd attracted the largest paid crowd to the Olympic Stadium: 78,322 people on July 6, 1977. The second-largest crowd was 73,898 for Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer on August 26, 1977. The largest crowds for an opera performance were on June 16 and 18, 1988, with 63,000 to watch a production of &quot;Aida&quot;.

== Transit ==

The stadium is directly connected to the Pie-IX metro station on the Green Line of the Montreal Metro. Viau metro station on the Green Line is also nearby.

== Facts and figures ==
* Well over its original budget, the stadium ended up costing $770 million to construct. By 2006, the final cost had risen to $1.47 billion when calculating in repairs, modifications and interest paid out. It took 30 years to finally pay off the cost, leading to its nickname of &quot;The Big Owe&quot; (a play on &quot;The Big O&quot;).
* The roof is only above the field of play. As a result, a number of pop-ups and long home runs hit the roof over the years, necessitating the painting of orange lines on the roof to separate foul balls from fair balls.
* During their years playing in Olympic Stadium the Expos were one of only two teams not to employ the traditional yellow-painted foul poles with the New York Mets being the other; Olympic&#x27;s poles were painted red while the Mets&#x27; home, Shea Stadium (and later Citi Field), used orange poles.
* The Olympic Stadium holds the record for a soccer game attendance in Canada. At the 1976 Summer Olympics soccer final, 71,617 people witnessed East Germany&#x27;s 3–1 win over Poland.
* A yellow seat on the 300 level commemorated a home run by Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates. It has since been moved to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.
* The Montreal games of the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup were held at Olympic Stadium on a removable Team Pro EF RD surface that was purchased specifically for the tournament.
* For the first time since the Olympic Games in 1976, a natural grass field was installed in the stadium for the Montreal Impact match versus A.C. Milan on June 2, 2010.
* The stadium features a 101,600-watt public address system.
* The main room of the stadium is the largest in Quebec, at 
* Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres got his 3,000th hit at Olympic Stadium on August 6, 1999, with a single in the first inning off Montreal Expos pitcher Dan Smith. He had four hits in the game.

== Commemorations ==

As part of the commemorative stamps created for the 1976 Olympics, Canada Post issued a stamp depicting the Olympic Stadium and Velodrome.

<doc id="550723" wikidata="Q3115851" url="?curid=550723" title="Graydon Creed">
<text>Graydon Creed is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Brandon Peterson and first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #299 (April 1993). He is the &quot; human&quot; son of Sabretooth and Mystique.

==Fictional character biography==
Posing as German spy Leni Zauber, Mystique seduced freelance assassin Victor Creed (Sabretooth) while he was in Germany on a mission. Mystique later gave birth to a normal human child—Graydon—whom she gave up for adoption, although she kept an eye on him. When Graydon learned that he was the son of two mutants who had abandoned him as an inconvenience, he grew resentful of all mutants and that resentment colored his outlook for the rest of his life.

In his adult years, Graydon formed a group called the Friends of Humanity, dedicated to opposing mutant civil rights by committing acts of terrorism against peaceful mutants and mutant sympathizers, and using the acts of violent mutants such as Magneto to rally support for their cause.

===Upstarts===
Creed also came to join the Upstarts, a group of wealthy and powerful individuals who had been brought together by Selene and the enigmatic telepathic Gamesmaster with the sole purpose of killing mutants for points in a twisted game. After learning of his parents&#x27; identities, Creed sought to kill them as part of the Upstarts&#x27; game. Disguised as the armored Tribune, Creed hired assassins to kill his mother and had his father implanted with a bomb. His father managed to remove the device and confronted his son, who callously stabbed Sabretooth&#x27;s assistant, Birdy, a mutant telepath whom Sabretooth employed to keep his homicidal rages in check.

During the Upstarts&#x27; self-professed &quot;Younghunt&quot;, Creed was blackmailed into revealing the location of the Upstarts&#x27; prisoners by the New Warriors, who threatened to expose Creed as a mutant collaborator and the son of mutants.

===Death===
Later, using the resources he had gained through the Friends of Humanity, and with the support of the government-sponsored anti-mutant taskforce, &quot;Operation: Zero Tolerance&quot;, Creed nominated himself as a presidential candidate and ran on an anti-mutant platform. Capitalizing on a near-hysterical fear of mutants in the general public (specially after the &quot;Onslaught&quot; debacle), Creed&#x27;s popularity surged, which led to the Daily Bugle newspaper launching an investigation into Creed&#x27;s activities, on-principle. When a reporter from the Bugle obtained information regarding Creed&#x27;s parentage, Zero Tolerance&#x27;s leader, Bastion, killed the journalist to prevent the news from leaking out. Although they stopped the reporter, Creed did not manage to catch that the X-Men had also infiltrated his presidential campaign, by planting Bobby Drake (under the alias of &quot;Drake Roberts&quot;) and Sam Guthrie (under the alias of &quot;Samson Guthry&quot;) as Creed&#x27;s assistants.

On the eve of the election, Creed was assassinated during a campaign speech when a plasma beam completely disintegrated him. Several years later, the miniseries, &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, revealed that a future version of Mystique had fired the shot, having sworn to kill Graydon for his part in the Friends of Humanity&#x27;s brutal attack on Trevor Chase, the grandson of her lover, Destiny.

===Purifiers===
The pages of X-Force show a group of Purifiers digging up the corpse of Graydon Creed, his body is then taken back to their base. It is re-animated by Bastion using the techno-organic virus taken from an &quot;offspring&quot; of Magus. Creed later went public with his return, claiming that his death was faked all along to allow him to go underground and avoid persecution from mutants.

During the &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Graydon Creed, alongside Steven Lang, is killed by Hope Summers.

===Hunt for Wolverine===
During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, and Daken fight their way past the zombies and soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine in order to get to the power station where the glowing green box suspected of causing the zombie outbreak is located. Sabretooth discovers that one of the soldiers is a zombie version of his son Graydon. After Lady Deathstrike and Daken are stabbed by a zombie version of Lord Dark Wind, Sabretooth fights his zombified son who states that there is 10 minutes left before Maybelle is burned to the ground. As Sabretooth continues his fight with Graydon, he tries to get answers on how Graydon came back from the dead. He doesn&#x27;t get an answer. After slaying the zombie Lord Dark Wind, Lady Deathstrike stabs the zombie Graydon in the neck.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Graydon Creed goes by the name &quot;Horror Show&quot; in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality. He&#x27;s a part of the X-Terminated team with a handful of other humans. He&#x27;s wearing an armor and appears to have a flamethrower and other firearms. He mentions that his father, Sabretooth, was apparently a brutal, abusive father. During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler&#x27;s trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA&#x27;s Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men&#x27;s Xavier and Hercules.

===Age of X===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality, Graydon Creed had led a strike force that put the mutant race on the verge of extinction.

===House of M===
After Magneto&#x27;s takeover of Genosha during the &quot;House of M&quot;, Graydon Creed rose to prominence as an anti-mutant activist, becoming friends with vice-president Bolivar Trask. His prominence was short-lived as Magneto (who compared Graydon Creed to Adolf Hitler) viewed it as his duty to rid the world of the man. Magneto sent his assassin Sabretooth to kill him. Graydon Creed&#x27;s massacred body was found by government agents, and Trask ordered his death ruled an accident to prevent panic.

===Mutant X===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; reality, Graydon Creed became President of the United States after Reed Richards&#x27; disappearance. He additionally reinstated S.H.I.E.L.D. and promoted Nick Fury to General.

==In other media==
Graydon Creed appears in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;, voiced by John Stocker. In his most notable appearances in the episodes &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, he is ousted from the Friends of Humanity after the X-Men expose his mutant heritage and unsuccessfully attempts to re-join them by killing Mystique and Nightcrawler.

<text>U.N.C.L.E. is an acronym for the fictional United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, a secret international intelligence agency from the 1960s American television series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; The stars of the original series were Robert Vaughn (as Napoleon Solo), David McCallum (as Illya Kuryakin), and Leo G. Carroll (as Alexander Waverly). The series included 105 episodes from 1964 to its cancellation in 1968. In 2015, a movie adaptation of the same name was released.

Responsible for &quot;maintaining political and legal order anywhere in the world,&quot; U.N.C.L.E. was characterized as multinational in its composition and international in scope, protecting and defending nations regardless of size or political persuasion. Within the series, U.N.C.L.E. operates in both communist and Third World countries, as well as in Western nations. In the episode entitled &quot;The Shark Affair,&quot; an enforcement agent of U.N.C.L.E., Napoleon Solo, reveals that the fictional U.N.C.L.E. is sponsored by major nations such as the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. Its primary opponent is the independent international criminal organization THRUSH (Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity).

==Fictional headquarters==
U.N.C.L.E. headquarters are shown to be situated in New York City near the Lower East 40s. The headquarters has four levels, and the roof is equipped with radar, a laser beam weapon, a helipad, and disguised communication antennas. Below the sublevel is an underground docking area and a tunnel that runs under the United Nations headquarters, giving U.N.C.L.E.&#x27;s boats access to the East River.

The headquarters are depicted as a fortress hidden in the center of a block of buildings, with brownstone apartment buildings serving as the exterior façade. At one end of the block, a public parking garage with machine gun bays hidden in the ceiling is shown to be present, as well as a three-story Whitestone building at the other end. The first and second floors of the Whitestone are occupied by The Masque Club, a private, members-only &quot;key club&quot; in which the waitresses wear masks. On the third floor, there are offices of U.N.C.L.E.&#x27;s propaganda front - a charity fundraising organization.

There are four primary entrances to the U.N.C.L.E. headquarters. In the daytime, field agents are admitted by way of Del Floria&#x27;s, a small, nondescript tailor and dry-cleaning shop located one flight below street level. The agents go to the single fitting booth and turn the coat hook on the back wall. Outside the shop, an operator activates a mechanism on the pressing machine that releases the disguised armored door. The wall swings inward, and the agents find themselves in the main admissions area. There, a receptionist pins on a security badge (white or later, yellow for highest security clearance; red and green for low clearance and visitors). A chemical on the receptionist&#x27;s fingers activates the badge. There are also entrances through the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lockers at the rear of the parking garage (intended for non-field personnel). After hours, when Del Floria&#x27;s is closed, agents may also enter through the Masque Club or the offices of the charitable organization.

Although in theory the location of U.N.C.L.E.&#x27;s New York headquarters is supposed to be secret, the very first episode of the series, &quot;The Vulcan Affair,&quot; demonstrates that it is a poorly kept secret at best, as the teaser of the episode shows THRUSH operatives infiltrating U.N.C.L.E. headquarters through Del Floria&#x27;s entrance in an attempt to mount an armed assault and kill U.N.C.L.E.&#x27;s Section One Number 1 - Mr. Waverly. Other episodes showing THRUSH&#x27;s knowledge of the location of U.N.C.L.E. headquarters include &quot;The Deadly Games Affair&quot;, &quot;The Deadly Decoy Affair&quot;, and &quot;The Mad, Mad Tea Party Affair&quot; (all first-season episodes). In &quot;The Deadly Decoy Affair,&quot; the Del Floria entrance is even used for egress during a high-profile prisoner transfer during daylight hours. Although, as noted in &quot;The Double Affair&quot; and other episodes, THRUSH has a very effective intelligence service and has also, as demonstrated in &quot;The Mad, Mad Tea Party Affair&quot;, successfully corrupted U.N.C.L.E. personnel, or infiltrated their own as moles.

The New York office is one of several located around the world. Some also use the Del Floria tailor shop as a front as seen, for example, with U.N.C.L.E.&#x27;s Italian headquarters in &quot;The King of Knaves Affair&quot;.

==Fictional logo==

The official logo of the organization within the series is a black Nicolosi globular projection with select lines of longitude and latitude picked out in white. Black concentric rings surround the globe; to the right of it is the black silhouette of a man in a black suit holding a gun at his side, and a black band beneath the globe and the man features the name &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; in the &quot;Decorated 035&quot; font. The logo is normally superimposed on a Mercator-style map of the world—yellow-brown continents with no country borders (a tribute to the one-world philosophy of U.N.C.L.E.) and blue seas, but is also used plain or with tones inverted on official U.N.C.L.E. documents.

==Origins==
According to &quot;The Cloak and Swagger Affair&quot;, a documentary about the making of the fictional series included with the 2007 DVD release, the producers of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; originally intended to leave the meaning of the U.N.C.L.E. acronym a mystery. The meaning of THRUSH was never revealed in the seriesalthough the 4th book in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; paperback series, &quot;The Dagger Affair,&quot; postulated that THRUSH stood for the &quot;Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity&quot;. The documentary states that after a protest from the [United Nations], which did not want to be connected to a fictional organization (such as, for example, &quot;United Nations Criminal Law Enforcement&quot;), the writers came up with a meaning that also became part of the series&#x27; trademark closing credit, thanking the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement for its cooperation with the producers of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; Other sources credit producer Sam Rolfe as originally intending that U.N.C.L.E. be identified as an arm of the United Nations (&quot;Behind that door is a man who reports only to the Secretariat of the United Nations!&quot; supposedly was part of his network pitch). As noted above, this idea was discarded for reasons still debated.

<text>Aulus Atilius Caiatinus (or Calatinus; 258–241 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who achieved prominence for his military activities during the First Punic War against Carthage. As consul in 258 BC, he enjoyed several successes in Sicily, for which he later celebrated a triumph. He undertook further campaigning in Sicily both at sea and on land during a second consulship (254 BC) and then as dictator (249 BC), becoming the first Roman dictator to lead an army outside mainland Italy.

Atilius held the office of censor in 247, the crowning achievement of a public career at the time. He later dedicated temples to Spes and Fides at Rome.

==Biography==
===Background and family===
Aulus Atilius Caiatinus, or Calatinus, probably belonged to an aristocratic family from Campania which had been welcomed to Roman high society following the region&#x27;s conquest by Rome during the Samnite Wars in the 4th century BC. The surname Caiatinus (or Calatinus) indicates that an ancestor came from, or held estates near, the Campanian town of Caiatia (or Calatia). The plebeian clan of the Atilii soon began attaining the highest offices of the Roman state, reaching a high point in its prestige around the time of the First Punic War (264–241 BC), with the successful careers of Atilius Caiatinus and several of his relatives (like Marcus Atilius Regulus and Gaius Atilius Bulbus).

Friedrich Münzer, in his influential study of the role of family relationships in Roman Republican politics, argued that this quick rise to prominence was the result of an alliance with the long-established patrician clan of the Fabii. Atilius Caiatinus himself seems to have been a maternal grandson of Fabius Rullianus, one of Rome&#x27;s heroes during the Samnite Wars; his parents&#x27; marriage is one of the earliest recorded unions between patricians and plebeians. Oakley dated his birth around 300–295 BC.

===First Punic War===

Atilius was one of the two Roman consuls of 258 BC, alongside Gaius Sulpicius Paterculus. At the start of the campaigning season he was sent to Sicily to conduct the war against the Carthaginians there. Joining the previous year&#x27;s consul, Gaius Aquillius Florus, he first went to Panormus to draw out some Punic troops who had been wintering there. When this failed, he moved on to Hippana and promptly took it by storm. Atilius afterward resumed the siege of Mytistraton, which Florus had tried to take without success the previous year, and obtained its surrender after the Carthaginian garrison withdrew during the night. The city was plundered and burnt to the ground, its inhabitants slaughtered or enslaved.

The ancient sources go on to report a story which has Atilius being ambushed at a narrow mountain pass while on the way to attack Camarina, only to be saved by the self-sacrifice of a tribune and 300 men, who held the enemy off until Atilius could extricate his army from danger, though the historicity of this anecdote has been doubted. Camarina itself was taken, as was Enna, the latter through treachery. An attempt by Atilius to seize the island of Lipara ended in failure. His command in Sicily continued through 257 BC with his election (presumably ) to the office of praetor, though he and his fellow commander Cornelius Blasio, one of the consuls, seem to have accomplished nothing worth of note this year. For his successes in 258, Atilius celebrated a triumph back at Rome on 19 January 256 BC.

Atilius was elected consul for a second time in 254 BC, probably chosen for his experience. He and his colleague in office, Cornelius Scipio Asina, at the head of a newly built fleet, sailed to Sicily and took Cephaloedium by treachery, but their subsequent attack on Drepana was repulsed by the Carthaginian Carthalo. The Romans then captured Panormus and other towns, though only the consul Scipio later celebrated a triumph for these victories; Lazenby suggests that this was because the consuls split their forces, with Scipio in charge of Panormus, the main target, while Atilius led the unsuccessful attack on Drepana, perhaps as a diversion. The consuls then withdrew to Messana, and Atilius then to Rome, taking the fleet with him.

In 249 BC, Atilius was appointed dictator in the aftermath of the Roman disaster at the naval Battle of Drepana. His deputy or &#x27;master of the horse&#x27; () was Lucius Caecilius Metellus. He was sent to Sicily, where he did not achieve anything remarkable, though this made him the first Roman dictator to lead an army outside of Italy.

===Later life===
Atilius was elected censor in 247 BC, as the plebeian counterpart to the patrician Aulus Manlius Torquatus Atticus. A factor in his election may have been his kinship to one of that year&#x27;s consuls, Numerius Fabius. In the census conducted during their censorship 241,212 adult male Roman citizens were recorded. This was a sharp decline from the number recorded in the 252 BC census – 297,797 – indicating the heavy toll that the war with Carthage had taken on the Roman population.

In 241 BC Atilius mediated a dispute between two commanders, the proconsul Lutatius Catulus and the propraetor Valerius Falto, regarding whom should celebrate a triumph for the Roman victory at the Battle of the Aegates. T. Corey Brennan says that &quot;there was simply no other man in Rome so qualified to judge&quot; the dispute, with Atilius having had a distinguished career and obtained the highest military and state honors. Atilius seems to have ruled the case in favor of Catulus, though in the end both parties celebrated triumphs.

Atilius dedicated a temple to Spes in the Forum Holitorium and another to Fides on the Capitoline Hill. His tomb was located at the Porta Capena, and Cicero preserves part of his epitaph.

<doc id="550740" wikidata="Q845546" url="?curid=550740" title="B, C, K, W system">
<text>The B, C, K, W system is a variant of combinatory logic that takes as primitive the combinators B, C, K, and W. This system was discovered by Haskell Curry in his doctoral thesis &quot;Grundlagen der kombinatorischen Logik&quot;, whose results are set out in Curry (1930). 

It has expressive power equivalent to that of [[B, C, K, W system|S, K, I]] system. Both systems are fully interchangeable. 

When compiling to combinators, an implementation may equally choose one system or the other, or both, as it helps shorten the encodings of functions. For example, the encodings of C exclusively in terms of S,K,I, as well as of S in B,C,W,K are long and complicated, as can be seen below, while their corresponding computational machine implementations are equally trivial. It can be worth it to add additional interpretation rules, allowing for much shorter code which can lead to more efficient execution.

==Definition==
The combinators are defined as follows:
* B &quot;x y z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; (&quot;y z&quot;)
* C &quot;x y z&quot; = &quot;x z y&quot;
* K &quot;x y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;
* W &quot;x y&quot; = &quot;x y y&quot;

Intuitively, 
* B &quot;x y&quot; is the composition of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;;
* C &quot;x&quot; is &quot;x&quot; with the flipped arguments order;
* K &quot;x&quot; is the &quot;constant &quot;x&quot;&quot; function, which discards the next argument;
* W duplicates its second argument for the doubled application to the first. Thus, it &quot;joins&quot; its first argument&#x27;s two expectations for input into one.

==Connection to other combinators==
In recent decades, the SKI combinator calculus, with only two primitive combinators, K and S, has become the canonical approach to combinatory logic. B, C, and W can be expressed in terms of S and K as follows:
* B = S (K S) K
* C = S (S (K (S (K S) K)) S) (K K)
* K = K
* W = S S (S K)

Another way is, having defined B as above, to further define C = S(BBS)(KK) and W = CSI. In fact, S(Kx)yz = Bxyz and Sx(Ky)z = Cxyz, as is easily verified. 

Going the other direction, SKI can be defined in terms of B, C, K, W as:
* I = W K
* K = K
* S = B (B (B W) C) (B B) = B (B W) (B B C).

Also of note, Y combinator has a short expression in this system, as Y = BU(CBU) = BU(BWB) = B(W(WK))(BWB), where U = WI = SII is the self-application combinator.

Using just two combinators, B and W, an infinite number of fixpoint combinators can be constructed, one example being B(WW)(BW(BBB)), discovered by R. Statman in 1986.
==Connection to intuitionistic logic==
The combinators B, C, K and W correspond to four well-known axioms of sentential logic:

:AB: (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;) → ((&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot;)),
:AC: (&quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;)) → (&quot;B&quot; → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot;)),
:AK: &quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;),
:AW: (&quot;A&quot; → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;)) → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;).

Function application corresponds to the rule modus ponens:

:MP: from &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; infer &quot;B&quot;.

The axioms AB, AC, AK and AW, and the rule MP are complete for the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic. In order for combinatory logic to have as a model:
*The implicational fragment of classical logic, would require the combinatory analog to the law of excluded middle, e.g., Peirce&#x27;s law;
*Complete classical logic, would require the combinatory analog to the sentential axiom F → &quot;A&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a composition of an integer &quot;n&quot; is a way of writing &quot;n&quot; as the sum of a sequence of (strictly) positive integers. Two sequences that differ in the order of their terms define different compositions of their sum, while they are considered to define the same integer partition of that number. Every integer has finitely many distinct compositions. Negative numbers do not have any compositions, but 0 has one composition, the empty sequence. Each positive integer &quot;n&quot; has 2&quot;n&quot;−1 distinct compositions.

A weak composition of an integer &quot;n&quot; is similar to a composition of &quot;n&quot;, but allowing terms of the sequence to be zero: it is a way of writing &quot;n&quot; as the sum of a sequence of non-negative integers. As a consequence every positive integer admits infinitely many weak compositions (if their length is not bounded). Adding a number of terms 0 to the &quot;end&quot; of a weak composition is usually not considered to define a different weak composition; in other words, weak compositions are assumed to be implicitly extended indefinitely by terms 0.

To further generalize, an &quot;A&quot;-restricted composition of an integer &quot;n&quot;, for a subset &quot;A&quot; of the (nonnegative or positive) integers, is an ordered collection of one or more elements in &quot;A&quot; whose sum is &quot;n&quot;.

==Examples==

The sixteen compositions of 5 are:
*5
*4 + 1
*3 + 2
*3 + 1 + 1
*2 + 3
*2 + 2 + 1
*2 + 1 + 2
*2 + 1 + 1 + 1
*1 + 4
*1 + 3 + 1
*1 + 2 + 2
*1 + 2 + 1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 3
*1 + 1 + 2 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1 + 2
*1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

Compare this with the seven partitions of 5:
*5
*4 + 1
*3 + 2
*3 + 1 + 1
*2 + 2 + 1
*2 + 1 + 1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

It is possible to put constraints on the parts of the compositions. For example the five compositions of 5 into distinct terms are:
*5
*4 + 1
*3 + 2
*2 + 3
*1 + 4.

Compare this with the three partitions of 5 into distinct terms:
*5
*4 + 1
*3 + 2.
Note that the ancient Sanskrit sages discovered many years before Fibonacci that the number of compositions of any natural number n as the sum of 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s is the nth Fibonacci number! Note that these are not general compositions as defined above because the numbers are restricted to 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s only.
*1=1 (1)
*2=1+1=2 (2)
*3=1+1+1=1+2=2+1 (3)
*4=1+1+1+1=1+1+2=1+2+1=2+1+1=2+2 (5)
*5=1+1+1+1+1=1+1+1+2=1+1+2+1=1+2+1+1=2+1+1+1=1+2+2=2+1+2=2+2+1 (8)
*6 will have 13 combinations etc.

==Number of compositions==
Conventionally the empty composition is counted as the sole composition of 0, and there are no compositions of negative integers.
There are 2&quot;n&quot;−1 compositions of &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1; here is a proof:

Placing either a plus sign or a comma in each of the &quot;n&quot; − 1 boxes of the array
:formula_1

produces a unique composition of &quot;n&quot;. Conversely, every composition of &quot;n&quot; determines an assignment of pluses and commas. Since there are &quot;n&quot; − 1 binary choices, the result follows. The same argument shows that the number of compositions of &quot;n&quot; into exactly &quot;k&quot; parts (a &quot;k&quot;-composition) is given by the binomial coefficient formula_2. Note that by summing over all possible numbers of parts we recover 2&quot;n&quot;−1 as the total number of compositions of &quot;n&quot;:

: formula_3

For weak compositions, the number is formula_4, since each &quot;k&quot;-composition of &quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot; corresponds to a weak one of &quot;n&quot; by the rule

:formula_5

It follows from this formula that the number of weak compositions of &quot;n&quot; into exactly &quot;k&quot; parts equals the number of weak compositions of &quot;k&quot; − 1 into exactly &quot;n&quot; + 1 parts.

For &quot;A&quot;-restricted compositions, the number of compositions of &quot;n&quot; into exactly &quot;k&quot; parts is given by the extended binomial (or polynomial) coefficient formula_6, where the square brackets indicate the extraction of the coefficient of formula_7 in the polynomial that follows it.

==Homogeneous polynomials==
The dimension of the vector space formula_8 of homogeneous polynomial of degree &quot;d&quot; in &quot;n&quot; variables over the field &quot;K&quot; is the number of weak compositions of &quot;d&quot; into &quot;n&quot; parts. In fact, a basis for the space is given by the set of monomials formula_9 such that formula_10. Since the exponents formula_11 are allowed to be zero, then the number of such monomials is exactly the number of weak compositions of &quot;d&quot;.

<doc id="550743" wikidata="Q4355647" url="?curid=550743" title="Betty Eadie">
<text>Betty (Jean) Eadie (born 1942) is an American author of several books on near-death experiences (NDEs). Her best-known book is &quot;Embraced by the Light,&quot; (1992) describing her NDE. It was followed by &quot;The Awakening Heart&quot; (1996). &quot;The Ripple Effect&quot; (1999) and &quot;Embraced by the Light: Prayers and Devotions for Daily Living&quot; (2001) were both published independently.

==Early life and career==
Eadie was born in Valentine, Nebraska to “a full-blooded Sioux Indian” mother and Scotch-Irish father, and was primarily raised on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. When she was four years old, Eadie&#x27;s parents separated and she was placed in St. Francis Indian School, an American Indian boarding school, along with six of her siblings. While in high school, she dropped out to care for a younger sister. She later studied to receive her diploma while on bed rest during her final pregnancy, and eventually pursued a college degree. She spent time variously in churches affiliated with Catholicism, Methodism, and for a time in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Seattle, though in numerous public talks she subsequently declared herself non-denominational.

After her NDE, Betty began volunteering her time at a cancer research center comforting dying patients and their families. She then studied hypnotherapy, graduating at the top of her class, and later opened her own clinic. After &quot;Embraced by the Light&quot; was published, Eadie gave up her hypnotherapy practice and began traveling extensively throughout the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Ireland, speaking on death and the afterlife. Eadie continues to collect and evaluate near-death accounts, as well as giving speeches and lectures.

==NDE account==

In her NDE account, Eadie reports many phenomena similar to other NDE accounts, such as going through a dark tunnel, seeing a bright light and experiencing a Life review, as well as other features unique to her story. In 1973, at age 31, Eadie was recovering from a surgical operation. Eadie reported that she first felt herself fading to lifelessness, then felt a surge of energy followed by a &quot;pop&quot; and feeling of release, a sense of freedom and movement unhindered by inertia or gravity. She was met by three angelic beings who spoke with her about her prior existence and hitherto suppressed memories in order to participate in earthly experience. She traveled to terrestrial locations such as her home merely by thinking about them, returned to her hospital, and then passed on through a dark tunnel-like medium in which she reported sensing other beings in a transitory preparatory stage.

Exiting the tunnel, Eadie approached an intense white light and met in heaven the embrace of Jesus Christ. During this encounter, she reported a strong sense of love and a high-speed transfer of answers to her many questions. Possessing a corporeal identity of an ethereal kind, she visited numerous places, persons, and phenomena such as natural settings and gardens beyond the character of the conventionally material, and was taken on a tour of sorts of learning experiences that she said felt equivalent to weeks or months.

In addition to discussing traditional Christian subjects such as prayer, creation, and the Garden of Eden, Eadie reported visiting a library of the mind. Here it became possible to know anything or anyone in history or the present, in minute and unambiguous detail, as well as being able to observe individuals on Earth and being taken to distant reaches and civilizations of the universe.

Warned initially upon arrival that she had died prematurely, Eadie was at last told she must return in order to fulfill the personal mission allocated her. Its specific character, like numerous other details, were removed from her memory, in order, she said she was told, to prevent difficulties in her fulfilling it. Upon protesting, she was made to understand the reason behind the necessity for her return and reluctantly agreed to do so. She exacted a promise that she would not be made to stay on Earth longer than necessary. She reported her return to material corporeality as extremely heavy-feeling and unpleasant, initially intermittent in phases, and accompanied not long after by a demonic visitation that was cut short by an angelic reappearance.

Eadie&#x27;s doctor reportedly verified her clinical death on a return visit to the hospital, attributing it to a hemorrhage during a nurses&#x27; shift change, and took great interest in her recollections. Independent verification of the length of her death was not possible, but she speculated it could have lasted up to four hours based on her memory of certain details preceding and following it.

==After==
Subsequent to her experience, she spoke of it very little and suffered a long-term depression. This, she attributed to the anticlimactic nature of returning to corporeality after experiencing the heaven of afterlife. She slowly became involved in near-death groups and studies and gave talks, subsequently going on to write her account in book form, which met with runaway success.

While her account incorporated elements of traditional Christianity, it also met with a certain degree of resistance as well. This was largely, in part, to its teaching (as she reported she was given it) that some denominations might approximate truth better than others. She explains, however, that different teachings were more appropriate for certain individuals at their given stage of spiritual development, and therefore judgment should not be passed on them for where they were. Unlike many fundamentalist Christians, and despite her own strict Catholic upbringing, and a temporary conversion to the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ through The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints, after her near-death experience, Eadie refers to God as &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;He&quot; and insists that all religions are necessary for each person. She claims that each religion is necessary for each person, because of their different levels of spiritual enlightenment. This is contrary to the views, shared by many Christian denominations worldwide, that Christianity is the one true, valid religion. Many of her statements also are ambiguous or conflict with the mainstream doctrine of the Trinity, and her website disavows the traditional condemnation of homosexuality. 

In addition, unlike some other Near-Death Experiencers, Eadie claims that reincarnation, as it is typically thought of, does not truly exist. Eadie claims she was told that only a few return to this earth more than once, that some are sent back as teachers to help others. She taught similar withholding of censure on individuals for things like atheism and homosexuality and rejected a common traditional image of hell as an eternity of suffering, suggesting that her life review experience, in which she was made to live and feel the full positive and negative consequences of her cumulative actions in intense detail, including their effects on all around her, were a more than adequate equivalent and probably what the term truly signified.

She also stressed that her key lesson was that life&#x27;s purpose was to learn love and to grow through the exercise of free will, including making mistakes. Other teachings she recounted being given included the idea that there were few if any true accidents and that human lives and paths were chosen, agreed to, and prepared for in advance, with memory of such details suppressed and veiled. Suicide, she said she was told, was wrong because it deprived people of opportunities to learn and grow, and that there was always hope in life.

==Sequels==
&quot;The Awakening Heart&quot; is Eadie&#x27;s second book and also became a NYT Bestseller in which she describes her challenges and experience that followed her NDE up through the time that &quot;Embraced By The Light&quot; was published, as well as giving additional details about her NDE that were not included in her first book. &quot;The Ripple Effect&quot; pursued these further, incorporating discussion of the numerous letters she began to receive in response from readers, as well as discussing other NDE contacts she later developed. Eadie formed her own Publishing house, Onjinjinkta Publishing, through which she published her third book and her fourth book, &quot;Embraced By The Light Prayers and Devotions for Daily Living&quot;, as well as various works from other authors.

Because of their appeal to the innate human desire for an understanding of afterlife, her works led to a strong reader response which she initially attempted to answer in detail but became forced to limit. To meet some of this demand, she developed a website for general information and inspirational materials, as well as distribution of her books and related materials.

During a 2004 interview on Coast to Coast AM radio with George Noory, she said she was disappointed, following her first book&#x27;s publication, that she was not permitted to return to the Celestial realm. While she could not presently know the full scope of her earthly purpose, she understood a film based on &quot;Embraced&quot; would also follow.

==Personal life==
Her husband, Joe, worked in aerospace computing and died in 2011. Together they had eight children.

<text>Desnica Radivojević (; born 14 December 1952) is a Bosnian politician who serves as Minister of Planning in the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Radivojević was a member of the Party of Democratic Action until June 2012.

==Early life==
Radivojević, an ethnic Serb, was born in Srebrenica, and attended elementary school and high school there. He then graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Maribor, in Slovenia in 1979.

==Career==
In Bratunac, he worked as a high school professor as of 1979. In 1980 he was conscripted in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. In 1981, he was employed in the &quot;Energoinvest&quot; Sarajevo – Factory of Car Batteries Srebrenica, working as senior associate, technologist-constructor, then as Director of the Maintenance Service and Assistant Director for Development until 1983.

As of 1983, he was a Director of the Factory of Tin Containers under the holding company &quot;UPI&quot; Sarajevo, where he worked until 1992. Between 1992 and 1996 he was a director in the company Corad in Bajina Bašta, Serbia. He became a member of the Electricity Steering Committee in 1996, where he worked for next two years. Between 1998 and 2000 he was once again a director of the tin packing factory.

===Political career===
He joined the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) in 1998. As a Serb, his membership in the elite of Bosniak-dominated SDA was regarded unusual. In 2000 he became a committeeman in the Municipal Council of Srebrenica. In the same year he was named Chairman of the Municipal Council of Srebrenica, where he worked until 2002. Between 27 January 2003 and 22 February 2007 he was one of the two Vice Presidents of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2006, he was a member of the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Between 2007 and 2010 he was Minister of Trade in the Federal Government, and in March 2011 he was named Minister of Physical Planning.

Radivojević was a member of the Party of Democratic Action until June 2012. On 22 June 2012, his resignation for his ministerial post was signed by President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Živko Budimir. However, Radivojević later claimed that he never offered a resignation. The problem occurred when members of the Federal Government from the Social Democratic Party wanted to vote for removals in the management and supervisory boards of public companies that are owned by the Federation, but they couldn&#x27;t get majority without Radivojević, who was a member of the SDA, who opposed SDP&#x27;s proposal. Soon, Radivojević claimed that he never made a request for resignation, so that he could vote for SDP&#x27;s proposal. However, in July, a court expert found his signature on the request for resignation authentic.

==Personal life==
Radivojević speaks English and has passive knowledge of German. He is married with three children. He did post-graduate study on the subject of business administration and financial management at the CBA Academy in Zagreb in 2005. In 2006, at the European University of Belgrade, he a gained master&#x27;s degree in economy.

<text>Punjabi cuisine is a culinary style originating in the Punjab, a region in the northern part of South Asia, which is now divided in an Indian part to the east and a Pakistani part to the west. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking.

== History ==

The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Dishes similar to tandoori chicken may have existed during the Harappan civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to the archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been unearthed. Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars which was used for roasting meats and baking breads. Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.

Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it.



==Style of cooking==
There are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many people still employ the traditional methods and equipment for cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens. Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level. This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi. According to Planalp (1971), &quot;the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi&quot; pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor. In rural Punjab, it is common to have communal tandoors, which are also called &quot;Kath&quot; &quot;tandoors&quot; in Punjabi.

==Staple foods==

Punjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products. These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people. The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy products in India. Therefore, dairy products form an important component of Punjabi diet.

Dairy products are a staple in Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer. Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day&#x27;s yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. Curd is used as dressing for many raita dishes, to prepare Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Chaas), and as a side dish in a meal. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of &quot;Lassi&quot;. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified butter).

Traditional and modern methods are employed for cooking Punjabi cuisine. The traditional stoves and ovens used to cook Punjabi food include:

===Chullah===
The traditional name of the stove in the Punjabi language is &quot;chulla&quot;. Traditional houses also have ovens (&quot;wadda chulla&quot; or &quot;band chulla&quot;) that are made from bricks, stones, and in many cases clay. Older communities in Punjab also used earth ovens (&quot;khadda chulla&quot;), but this tradition is dying out now. 

===Bhathi===
A masonry oven is known as a bhathi. Outdoor cooking and grilling have many different types of bhathi. A bhathi is used to roast wheat or corn for which Kalsi (1992) describes as a &quot;special oven with an open pan in which sand is heated to roast corn.&quot;

===Hara===
A hara is a six-foot-tall oven with its own roof. The hara is traditionally used to slow-heat milk or slow-cook pulses such as chickpeas.

===Tandoor===

According to &quot;Ancient Pakistan - An Archaeological History&quot; by Mukhtar Ahmed, Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Roy Hayter the original versions of the tandoor &quot;in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground&quot;. He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.

===Modern methods===
* Pressure cookers
* Iron griddle

==Etiquette of Punjabi dining==
Etiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette. The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab. Communal dining is a norm in Punjabi families.

Bringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the spring season. Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality. Mango is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, and mango parties are common during the fruit&#x27;s harvest season. Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives.

=== Major features of etiquette ===

An invitation to a meal or tea is typically distributed few days beforehand. Denying the invitation for no major reason is considered a breach of etiquette.

Table setting is done before the arrival of the guests.

Family members or any occupants within one home make sure to eat together during the dinner. If any other person is present in the vicinity, then they are offered meals as a way of giving respect. It is considered rude to start eating food without asking others to participate in a meal. It is customary to offer food to anyone in your vicinity before eating. The invited guest or elder person is given special respect and attention. Usually the invited guest is requested to start the meal. It is considered rude if the host starts eating without taking into account the attendance of all guests.

Punjabi families use a hybrid style of South Asian and European utensil etiquette most of the times. The bread and rice are eaten with the hands. Desserts are eaten with spoons. Soup spoons are used for consuming soup and forks are used for eating noodles. Chewing food with one&#x27;s mouth open and burping in front of others is considered rude. In the villages of Punjab, an additional common plate is usually placed on the table for any bones left from the consumption of bone meat. Placing leftovers on the floor or on the table floor is considered bad etiquette.

==Punjabi dhaba==
The roadsides often serve as suburban eatery centers. They can also be a communal place to sit and chat. Some serve on the same concept of the greasy spoon.

== Punjabi restaurants ==

Punjabi cuisine has spread internationally. Punjab in London has been family-run since 1946 and is the UK&#x27;s oldest North Indian restaurant. The New Punjab Club, located in Hong Kong, became the world&#x27;s first Punjabi restaurant to earn one Michelin star in 2019.

<text>Cladium (fen-sedge, sawgrass or twig-sedge) is a genus of large sedges, with a nearly worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate regions. These are plants characterized by long, narrow (grass-like) leaves having sharp, often serrated (sawtooth-like) margins, and flowering stems 1–3 m tall bearing a much-branched inflorescence. Like many plants found in wet habitats, it has deeply buried rhizomes that can produce tall shoots with dense canopies.

&quot;Cladium mariscus &quot;subsp.&quot; jamaicense&quot;, or saw-grass, is common in marshes and savannas throughout the tropical Americas. One typical and well-known area of extensive saw-grass growth is the Florida Everglades; sawgrass is the plant referred to by the descriptor, &quot;River of Grass&quot;. Like many species of the Everglades, &quot;C. jamaicense&quot; grows in extremely infertile conditions, particularly wet sites that are low in phosphorus. Dense sawgrass beds are intermingled with other vegetation types. Together they produce a rich array of habitats that support the biological diversity of the Everglades. American alligators also use sawgrass to build nests. Phosphorus from agricultural runoff favoured dense cattail over rich sawgrass habitats, choking off water access for animals and birds. Eighty plant and animal species in the Everglades are threatened or endangered.

&quot;Cladium mariscoides&quot;, or twig-rush, is also a wetland plant, but is found further north, and in other kinds of wetlands including fens, wet meadows and pond shores. Owing to such specific habitat requirements, it is quite rare in the northern states such as Minnesota. &quot;Finding a self-sustaining population of &quot;C. mariscoides&quot; on a lake shore is indeed a very rare event in Minnesota&quot;.

&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot; is frequently encountered in English fens. Its ability to form dense stands can lead to reduced plant diversity. Hence, it is sometimes mowed to reduce dominance.

Sawgrass may be useful as a source for developing biofuel (ethanol), possibly replacing corn as the cellulose (the basis for developing ethanol) source of choice. On Gotland, a limestone island in the Baltic sea, Cladium mariscus is used for thatching.

==Fossil record==
Several fossil endocarps of †&quot;Cladium bicorne&quot; and †&quot;Cladium reidiorum&quot; have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.

==Species==
The number of species contained in the genus is disputed, with different authors accepting between two and 60 species as distinct. At present, three species are accepted by Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, one having four subspecies.

*&quot;Cladium costatum&quot; – known only from Venezuela and Guyana
*&quot;Cladium mariscoides&quot; – smooth sawgrass (eastern North America from Labrador to Manitoba, south to Florida and Texas)
*&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot; – great fen-sedge, saw-sedge 
**&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot; subsp. &quot;californicum&quot; – California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Texas, Sonora, Coahuila
**&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot; subsp. &quot;intermedium&quot; Kük. – Australia, New Caledonia
**&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot; subsp. &quot;jamaicense&quot; (Crantz) Kük. – Latin America from Mexico to Argentina; West Indies; southeastern United States from Texas to Delaware; naturalized in tropical Africa and on many oceanic islands including Canary Islands, Madagascar, New Guinea, Hawaii
**&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot; subsp. &quot;mariscus&quot; – Europe, northern Asia and North Africa from Ireland and Morocco to Japan, including Germany, Italy, France, Scandinavia, Poland, Balkans, Ukraine, Russia, Siberia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Himalayas, Kazakhstan, China, Korea

<text>The Durant was a make of automobile assembled by Durant Motors Corporation of New York City, New York from 1921 to 1926 and again from 1928 to 1932. Durant Motors was founded by William &quot;Billy&quot; Durant after he was terminated, for the second and final time, as the head of General Motors. Billy Durant&#x27;s intent was to build an automotive empire that could one day challenge General Motors.

The Durant automobile is considered to be an example of an &quot;assembled&quot; automobile because so many of its components were obtained from outside suppliers. From 1921 to 1926 the vehicle was powered by a four cylinder or 6 cyl overhead valve Continental engine. The vehicle was directed at the Oakland automobile price point.

Production of the vehicle was suspended for 1927. When the Durant was reintroduced April 1928, the car was redesigned and powered by a six cylinder Continental engine; some of the early vehicles were marketed as the &quot;Durant-Star&quot;. Bodies for the vehicle were supplied by Budd Company. In 1930, some Durants were built with all steel bodies, also supplied by Budd.

Durant Motors was found insolvent and automobile production ended early in 1932.

<doc id="550767" wikidata="Q335589" url="?curid=550767" title="Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury">
<text>Robert Michael James Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury, Baron Gascoyne-Cecil (born 30 September 1946) is a British Conservative politician. From 1979 to 1987 he represented South Dorset in the House of Commons, and in the 1990s he was Leader of the House of Lords under his courtesy title of [[Viscount Cranborne]]. Lord Salisbury lives in one of England&#x27;s largest historic houses, the 17th-century Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, and currently serves as Chancellor of the University of Hertfordshire.

==Early life==
Robert Michael James Gascoyne-Cecil was born on 30 September 1946, the eldest child and first-born son of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury. His younger brother was the journalist Lord Richard Cecil, who was killed covering the conflict in Rhodesia in 1978.

Lord Cranborne attended Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, and became a merchant banker before going to work on the family estates.

==Political career==

===House of Commons===
Lord Cranborne was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for South Dorset in 1976, where his family owned land, despite there being on the shortlist several former members of parliament who had lost their seats in the two 1974 elections. At the 1978 Conservative Party conference he spoke in opposition to British sanctions against Rhodesia. He won the South Dorset seat at the 1979 general election, becoming the seventh consecutive generation of his family to sit in the House of Commons. In his maiden speech, he urged Ian Smith, prime minister of Rhodesia, to stand aside in favour of Abel Muzorewa.

Cranborne gained a general reputation as a right-winger, especially on matters affecting the Church of England, but confounded this reputation when he co-wrote a pamphlet in 1981 which said that the fight against unemployment ought to be given more priority than the fight against inflation. He took an interest in Northern Ireland, and, when Jim Prior announced his policy of &#x27;Rolling Devolution&#x27;, resigned an unpaid job as assistant to Douglas Hurd.

Lord Cranborne became known in the early 1980s as an anti-communist, as a supporter of Afghan refugees (from the Soviet invasion of that country) in Pakistan, and for sending food parcels to Poland. Until the early years of the 21st century, a charity shop was run on his Hatfield House estate solely to raise money for these causes, including funds for Polish orphanages. He was involved in efforts to fund the Afghan resistance. His strong opposition to any involvement by the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland led him to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement and contributed to his decision to retire from the House of Commons in 1987.

===House of Lords===
After the 1992 general election, John Major used a writ of acceleration to call Lord Cranborne up to the House of Lords in one of his father&#x27;s junior titles. Thus, Lord Cranborne was summoned to Parliament as Baron Cecil, of Essendon in the County of Rutland (his father&#x27;s most junior dignity), although he continued to be known by his courtesy style of Viscount Cranborne. This is the most recent time a writ of acceleration has been issued, and due to the provisions of the House of Lords Act 1999, abolishing the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, any future use of the writ of acceleration is highly unlikely.

He served for two years as a junior defence minister before being appointed as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords in 1994. Lord Cranborne was appointed by the Queen as Privy Counsellor (PC) on 21 July 1994. Funding for opposition parties in the House of Lords, known as Cranborne Money, began during his leadership. When Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party in an attempt to test his authority as leader in July 1995, Lord Cranborne led his re-election campaign. He was recognised as one of the few members of the Cabinet who were personally loyal to Major, but continued to lead the Conservative Peers after Labour won the 1997 general election.

When the new Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed the removal of the hereditary element in the House of Lords, Lord Cranborne negotiated a pact with the Labour government to retain a small number of hereditary peers (later set at 92) for what was intended to be an interim period. For the sake of form this amendment was formally proposed by Lord Weatherill, Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers. However, Lord Cranborne gave his party&#x27;s approval without consulting the party leader, William Hague, who knew nothing and was embarrassed when Blair told him of it in the House of Commons. Hague then sacked Lord Cranborne, who accepted his error, saying that he had &quot;rushed in, like an ill-trained spaniel&quot;.

All former Leaders of the House of Lords who were hereditary peers accepted life peerages to keep them in the upper house in 1999. Lord Cranborne, who had received the title Baron Gascoyne-Cecil, of Essendon in the County of Rutland, remained active on the backbenches until the House of Lords adopted new rules for declaration of financial interests which he believed were too onerous. He took &quot;Leave of Absence&quot; on 1 November 2001. He was therefore out of the House of Lords when he succeeded his father as the 7th Marquess of Salisbury on 11 July 2003.

In January 2010, Lord Salisbury and Owen Paterson, the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, hosted secret talks at Hatfield House, involving the DUP, the UUP and the Conservative Party. These talks prompted speculation that the Conservatives were attempting to create a pan-unionist front to limit Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party at the 2010 general election.

In September 2012, Lord Salisbury, in his role as Chairman of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and became a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).

He retired from the House of Lords on 8 June 2017, the date of the snap general election. He was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG) on 27 February 2019.

==Other interests==
Salisbury is a Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire, and the current president of the Friends of the British Library and of the Friends of Friendless Churches.

Lord Salisbury is the chairman of the Constitution Reform Group (CRG), a cross-party pressure group which seeks a new constitutional settlement in the UK by way of a new Act of Union. The group backed the Act of Union Bill 2017–19, introduced as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill by Lord Lisvane in the House of Lords on 9 October 2018, when it received a formal first reading; its passage through Parliament was terminated by the ending of the parliamentary session in October 2019.

Lord Salisbury writes for &quot;The Spectator&quot; and the Centre for Policy Studies under the informal name of Robert Salisbury. He is the chairman of Reaction.

In 2020, Lord Salisbury published a book entitled &quot;William Simpson and the Crisis in Central Asia, 1884–5&quot;. It is a non-fiction book on the Victorian war artist William Simpson, and his involvement with the Afghan Boundary Commission, a surveying project which nearly triggered a war with Tsarist Russia in 1885. The book was privately published as a contribution to the Roxburghe Club, and is illustrated by a set of sketches by Simpson, now owned by Lord Salisbury.

Since 2023, Lord Salisbury is the chairman of the London Defence Conference, held in partnership with King&#x27;s College London.

==Marriage and children==
In 1970, aged 23, he married Hannah Stirling, daughter of Bill Stirling of Keir, niece of Colonel Sir David Stirling (a co-founder of the SAS) and a descendant of the Lords Lovat, Scottish Catholic aristocrats. The marriage was initially opposed by his family, chiefly because Stirling was a Catholic.

During the 1970s, Lord and Lady Cranborne had two sons and three daughters (including twins); the two elder daughters are now married. Until recently, they lived at Cranborne Manor, Dorset. The family seat is Hatfield House, once home to Queen Elizabeth I of England, which was given to the family by James I of England in exchange for the Cecil family house Theobalds. The Cecils are landowners in Dorset, Hertfordshire and London, and the 7th Marquess ranked 352nd in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2017, with an estimated net worth of £335m (of which the paintings at Hatfield accounted for £150m).

The Marquess of Salisbury&#x27;s heir is his elder son Robert Edward &quot;Ned&quot; William Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne (born 1970). He was a page of honour to the Queen from 1983 to 1986. The heir is unmarried, though he does have a daughter born in 2001. The younger son, Lord James, has married and fathered one son, Thomas Richard James (born 2009).

<doc id="550769" wikidata="Q83786" url="?curid=550769" title="Shimla">
<text>Shimla (; ; also known as Simla, the official name until 1972) is the capital and the largest city of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. In 1864, Shimla was declared the summer capital of British India. After independence, the city became the capital of East Punjab and was later made the capital city of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state.

Small hamlets were recorded before 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Deputation of 1906, the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After the reorganisation of the state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.

Shimla is home to several buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attract tourists. Major city centre&#x27;s attractions include the &quot;Shri Hanuman Jakhu (Statue),&quot; Jakhu Temple, Viceregal Lodge, Christ Church, Mall Road, The Ridge and Annadale. The city centre&#x27;s northernmost point is Jakhoo and the southernmost location is Annadale, the easternmost point is Sanjauli and the western point is Chotta Shimla. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with several colleges and research institutions.

== Etymology ==

One theory suggests that the name &quot;Shimla&quot; was derived from &quot;Shyamalaya&quot;, meaning &#x27;blue house&#x27;, a solitary house made of blue slate on Jakhu Hill, built by a fakir.

According to another version, the city gets its name from &quot;Shamli&quot; or &quot;Shyamala&quot;, meaning &#x27;blue lady&#x27;, referring to the goddess Kali. It is believed that a temple dedicated to goddess Shamli, an incarnation of Kali, used to be on the Jakhu hillside near the Rothney Castle. Many believe that during the British period, the image of the goddess was shifted to a new place, the now-famous Kali Bari Temple.

In 2018, the state government decided to change the city&#x27;s name from Shimla to Shyamala. However, seeing the negative response of the general public, the state government dismissed the plan.

==History==
Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only sign of civilisation was the Jakhu Temple and a few scattered houses. The area was called &#x27;Shimla&#x27;, named after Hindu goddess &quot;Shyamala Devi&quot;, an incarnation of Kali.
The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as &quot;a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers&quot;. In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area named Kennedy Cottage in 1822, near Annadale, what is now the home for CPWD office. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, William Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Stapleton Cotton, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhoo. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.

In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting between the Governor-General Lord William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:
Combermere&#x27;s successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal, and saw regular visits from the Governors-General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. Several young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties, and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, several bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844, the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52. The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.

In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla. He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, even though it was difficult to reach. Robert Bulwer-Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the &quot;Upper Bazaar&quot; nowadays known as the Ridge), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as a library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.
During the &quot;Hot Weather&quot;, Shimla was also the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many departments of the Government of India. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed the Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen, &quot;was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.&quot; This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants, and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for &quot;frivolity, gossip, and intrigue&quot;.

The Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium Tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about in length, was also built in 1905.

The Simla Convention, an ambiguous treaty concerning the status of Tibet negotiated by representatives of the Republic of China, Tibet and Great Britain was signed in Simla in 1913 and 1914. At the convention a demarcation line between Tibet and the North-east region of India was proposed by Sir Henry McMahon. The line came to be known as McMahon Line and is currently the effective boundary between China and India, although its legal status is disputed by the Chinese government. This was also the site of a series of talks held by Viceroy Wavell to discuss a plan for the independence of India with the Indian political leaders of the time. Known as the Simla Conference, the talks failed to bring about a resolution.

Shimla was the capital city in exile of British Burma (present-day Myanmar) from 1942 to 1945.
The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla&#x27;s accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the &quot;British Jewel of the Orient&quot;. In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Following the partition of India, it briefly served as the capital of East Punjab, until construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital.

After independence, the Chief Commissioner&#x27;s Province of Himachal Pradesh came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states by the issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged into the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. The legislative assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956. Following areas of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kullu and Lahaul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh Tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una Kanungo circle, some areas of Santokhgarh Kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot district; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on the enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, The State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.

The Simla Agreement treaty was signed in Shimla by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the President of Pakistan, and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India. The agreement paved the way for diplomatic recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan. Technically the document was signed at 0040 hours on the night of 3 July; despite this official documents are dated 2 July 1972.

Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Assembly Chamber, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India. The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burnt down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall Road, which ran along the length of the Ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the viceroy and his wife.

==Geography==
Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at . It has an average altitude of above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly from east to west.

The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region. There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about away. Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna).

The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over . The main forests in and around the city are of Pine, Deodar, Oak and Rhododendron. Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot. Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.

The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, and Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla.

To the east of Shimla stand the Choor Mountains (Chuor, 3647m). A passage over these mountains, from the Tons River to Shimla is described in &quot;Views in India, chiefly among the Himalaya Mountains&quot;, by with accompanying drawings, &quot;Village of Khandoo, on the Ascent to the Choor&quot;, and two that were subsequently the subject of poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, namely &quot;Crossing the Choor Mountains&quot;, and &quot;Village of Koghera and Deodar Forest, near the Choor&quot;.

The accompanying notes record that &quot;During a considerable part of the year, the Choor is hoary with snow; and when moonlight falls upon the scene, an effect is produced as if floods of molten silver were poured over the surface. Moonlight in these regions assumes a novel charm.&quot;

Shimla city is geographically uniquely positioned in such a way, that if water is poured on the northern slope at the , it goes to the Arabian Sea via the Sutej River, and if water is poured on the southern slope, it meets the Bay of Bengal through the Yamuna River.
=== Seven Hills of Shimla ===

Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhu Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhu hill, which is at a height of . In recent times the city has spread past the initial seven hills.

==Climate==

Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.

The average temperature during summer is between , and between in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between in November and in August. It is typically around per month during winter and spring, and around in June as the monsoon approaches.

The average total annual precipitation is , which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.

The maximum snowfall received in recent times was on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received of snow.

On the weekend of 12–13 August 2023, torrential rains attributed to climate change caused major landslides in Shimla, killing at least 57 people. These were part of the 2023 North India floods.

Highest recorded temperature: on 28 May 2010 (A temperature of was recorded on 22 May 2012 at Shimla airport.)

Lowest recorded temperature: on 13 December 1963.

== Economy ==
Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors. Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers.

In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area&#x27;s healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals: Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city&#x27;s development plan aims to make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot. Major departmental headquarters of the state are also located in Shimla such as Himachal Pradesh Government Printing and Stationery Press, Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board, and Himachal Pradesh Police Headquarters.

The hotel industry is one of the major sources of income generation for the city. Shimla has up to 6500 hotels, including 5-star hotels, most popular is Oberoi Cecil, Peterhoff, Wildflower Hall and Hotel Holiday Home. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest-ranked hotels.

Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla. Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state.

The government is trying to promote the technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla.

==Civic administration==

The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu, and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 41 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the government of Himachal Pradesh. The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics, and other activities. 33% of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and among the councillors themselves.

The administrative head of the corporation is the Commissioner who is appointed by the state government.

The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.

The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha). Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the Police Force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla. The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.

There are 11 courts in the district including a fast-track court.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females. Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020. The effective literacy rate of city was 93.63% and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14%.

The city area has grown considerably over time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side &amp; Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census, the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km2. A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism. The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population is younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001 – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole.

The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and education.

<doc id="550777" wikidata="Q1009355" url="?curid=550777" title="Bundling (tradition)">
<text>Bundling, or tarrying, is the traditional practice of wrapping a couple together in a bed sometimes with a board between the two of them, usually as a part of courting behavior. The tradition is thought to have originated either in the Netherlands or in the British Isles and later became common in colonial United States, especially in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Bundling is associated with the Amish as a form of courtship. 

==Origin==
It is possible the precedent for bundling came from the biblical story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a widow, and Boaz, a wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room. Tradition says they did not touch, and the pair later got married.

==Courtship practice==
Bundling, or &quot;bed courting&quot; is believed to have originated in the pre-Celtic populations of the British Isles and was introduced to the American colonies by European immigrants (primarily Dutch and Welsh) where it attained unprecedented popularity. Traditionally, the practice of courtship involved two young adults or adolescents, often betrothed, who spent the night in bed together under the parental roof to ensure compatibility and accountability. A bundling board or bundling sack may make an appearance, as it takes the form of a contraceptive for a bundling couple. A bundling board was a large plank that was placed in between the couple and the bundling sack was a sleeping bag that was sewn up the middle. Periods of popularity for the practice of bundling often align with eras of enhanced social position for women, as this custom afforded a high level of protection against premarital sex.

The custom of bundling, which became common in New England in the eighteenth century, was used to certify that an unwed father was held accountable for an illegitimate pregnancy. The courtship practice would ensure that there would be witnesses to certify any intimacy that took place. Within the seventeenth century, courts were more willing to accept a woman&#x27;s testimony that a specific man had fathered her child. Stricter standards came about in the eighteenth century when the court officials wanted evidence in support of the woman&#x27;s allegation, which could be difficult to obtain. If a couple had sex in secret and the woman became pregnant, no witness of the relation would have taken place. Marriage by a spousal contract or in a church would often follow bundling.

== In the United States ==
Two forms of bundling in Colonial America are generally discussed: a sleeping arrangement between strangers, or the bed-sharing of lovers under parental supervision. The former definition refers to the practice used to accommodate the heavy traffic of travelers in the underdeveloped colonies, often with no implication of sexual activity. The latter, however, refers to the courtship practice which ensured legal accountability for an unwed father in the case of pre-marital pregnancy. The courtship ritual of bundling was primarily observed in rural communities. The measure of familial and community protection which bundling provided against the scandal of abandonment was not offered in urban settings where populations had a much higher degree of mobility and anonymity.

Despite some religious criticism, bundling rose in popularity amongst rural populations throughout the eighteenth century. The prevalence of premarital sex in colonial America is shown by the rate of legitimate births within the first nine months of marriage; the late eighteenth century observed a remarkable increase in pre-marital pregnancies, with 30-40% of infants born within the first nine months of marriage. This is due in part to a sexually permissive subculture cultivated by parents of the less-wealthy classes. A high correlation is observed between the pre-marital pregnancy status of mothers and daughters in the 18th century.

In Colonial United States, Jonathan Edwards and other preachers condemned bundling. American Puritanism condemned the practice of bundling as immoral, or un-Christian. The heyday of bundling in the late 18th century corresponds to a period of low engagement with puritanical ideals, when religious participation for adolescents was not strictly enforced by societal standards. With the Second Great Awakening at the turn of the 19th century, religion became a much larger part of adolescent life and puritanical morals were more heavily enforced by a larger societal group. As social opinion moved away from the practical solution of bundling to the ideological solution of abstinence and moral responsibility, the popularity of bundling waned.

It is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in New York state and perhaps in New England, though its popularity was waning. The court case of &quot;Graham v. Smith&quot;, 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the seduction of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative Old Order Amish affiliations, where it was still in use , regardless of location. In the modern United States, practices of &quot;dating&quot; and &quot;necking&quot; might be tied to the previous practice of bundling. Public widespread anxiety about the vulnerability of young women led to new writing which was published in newspapers and magazines during the eighteenth century.

== Bundling outside the United States ==
The Kwanyama are one of the eight Ambo Bantu tribes that live in Southwest Africa. The courtship practice of bundling is popular amongst the Kwanyama. This practice began within the Kwanyama Ambo tribe during the eighteenth century. Bundling for the Kwanyama does not imply sexual intercourse, but rather the word bundling is &quot;okunangala&quot;, which means &quot;to sleep together.&quot; In South Africa, bundling prevented the birth of illegitimate children. Kwanyama engaged couples bundle under supervision, but illegitimate bundling occurs at night during public gatherings—meaning no witness is present.

Bundling had been reported across the Germanic tribes, the Celts, the Finns and people of the Baltic states. The German-Swiss custom of &quot;Kiltgang&quot; demonstrates the practice of boys and girls who were at puberty age spending the night in bed together. This practice began in the nineteenth century in Norway and Sweden. The participants were either entirely or partially clothed, and sexual intercourse would not occur. The youth were enabled to choose a mate without the interference of their parents.

In the seventeenth century, Jewish society encouraged affection before marriage similar to the practice of allowing engaged couples to spend time in bed together before their wedding. This suggests similarities to bundling practices in early modern France and North America. Bundling within Jewish courtship practices involved some sexual contact short of intercourse. Seventeenth century moralist Isaiah Horowitz denounced this practice, as he was concerned with the sexual transgressions that may occur from romantic affection before the wedding. In the eighteenth century, another moralist Ezekiel Landau reported a case where &quot;Jewish bundling&quot; led to intercourse.

==Literature==
The writer Washington Irving, in book 3, chapter 7 of &quot;A History of New York&quot; (1809) as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice.This amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling—a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community.Historian Edward Shorter wrote in his novel, &quot;The Making of the Modern Family&quot;, that the widespread increase of illegitimate births through courtship practices comprised a &quot;sexual revolution&quot; that was issued by the rise of industrial capitalism within the eighteenth century.

Jakob Huizinga, a Mennonite reverend who remained on the island of Texel (northwestern part of The Netherlands) from 1844 to 1881 wrote about unlawful premarital sexuality in his diary. Huizinga referred to the &quot;Texel custom&quot; or &quot;night courting&quot; practice that consisted of potential suitors entering an unmarried woman&#x27;s bedroom at night. Night courting, bundling, or &quot;festerln&quot; was organized in areas bordering the North Sea as well as the Alps and Baltic region.

<text>Xtort (stylized as XTOЯT) is the eighth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on June 25, 1996, by Wax Trax! Records. It was recorded from the end of 1995 through early 1996, shortly after the death of Wax Trax! co-founder and band friend Jim Nash. &quot;Xtort&quot; features a variety of guest artists from the industrial music scene and studio musicians from other genres, but includes limited participation from core member En Esch.

The album was massively promoted by KMFDM&#x27;s American label TVT Records, which pressed tens of thousands of copies of its lead single &quot;Power&quot;. Frontman Sascha Konietzko created his own form of promotion, issuing a press release that both disparaged and lauded the coming set. &quot;Xtort&quot; was generally well-received by critics and is the band&#x27;s highest-charting album to date. After the original release went out of print, a remastered version was released in 2007.
==Background==
In late 1995, KMFDM had completed the &quot;Beat by Beat&quot; and &quot;In Your Face&quot; tours in support of their last album, &quot;Nihil&quot;. KMFDM frontman and founder Sascha Konietzko described &quot;Nihil&quot; as &quot;the crown&quot;, and said the band had come as close to mainstream popularity as he wanted. He felt the band needed to move away from its success. In 2007, Konietzko recalled that he had &quot;hated all the attention, interviews, photo shoots, etc.&quot;. After the tours, Konietzko returned to Chicago in order to be with his friend Jim Nash, co-founder of Wax Trax! Records, who was dying from AIDS. Konietzko referred to the death of Nash that October as &quot;the end of an era&quot;.

En Esch, one of the longtime core members of KMFDM, had almost nothing to do with &quot;Xtort&quot;, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch&#x27;s lack of participation, Konietzko said, &quot;En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it&#x27;s always my belief that the thing must keep moving; I had to do it without him.&quot; He also said the two were not in communication around the time of the album&#x27;s release.

==Production==
&quot;Xtort&quot; was pre-produced and tracked in Seattle at Hole in the Wall Studio, and recorded and mixed in Chicago at Chicago Recording Company. Konietzko contacted F. M. Einheit and had him come to Chicago in January 1996 to work on some tracks together. Konietzko also brought in a number of Wax Trax! alumni, such as Chris Connelly of Revolting Cocks and Bill Rieflin of Ministry, to help with the album&#x27;s creation, along with assistance from more than a dozen studio musicians. Konietzko required all the album&#x27;s contributors to be on call thirteen hours a day during production, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care what they do on their own time, but when they do KMFDM, if they don&#x27;t comply with the schedule, they&#x27;re out.&quot;

Konietzko said the ideas for songs began with individual sounds, which he then modified until he created a looped rhythm. &quot;Craze&quot;, for example, Konietzko called &quot;an homage to Atari Teenage Riot, a band with two guys, one girl, a couple TR90S drum machines and a bass machine.&quot; He said he was inspired by touring with the band in Europe in support of &quot;Nihil&quot; in 1995. After creating the base tunes, the songs went to Günter Schulz, another longtime member, to add guitars. With the completed songs, Konietzko then allowed guest artists, such as Connelly, to pick songs they wanted to contribute to, and added their vocals or other instrumentation. For &quot;Xtort&quot;, Konietzko used Macintosh products to do all the synchronization.

Connelly contributed to four tracks, including &quot;Blame&quot;, which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California, based group Tower of Power. Nicole Blackman, KMFDM&#x27;s publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals to the track &quot;Dogma&quot;, which was adapted from the ten-minute live performance she provided while touring with the band. &quot;Power&quot;, meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band&#x27;s label, Wax Trax!, for a radio promo song. Konietzko said he&#x27;d heard &quot;radio didn&#x27;t like big female choruses&quot;, so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson to help with the song, which he called &quot;dumb and catchy&quot;. The hidden track of the album, &quot;Fairy&quot;, is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s. Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail&#x27;s &quot;dirty fantasies&quot;. He also said it was not a serious track: &quot;it was more like kids at play&quot;. For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schulz played piano.

==Release==
The first track on the album, &quot;Power&quot;, was featured on the &quot;Wax Trax! Summer Swindle&quot;, a cassette sampler included with 45,000 issues of the July 1996 issue of &quot;Alternative Press&quot;. Another 50,000 copies of the sampler were to be handed out at summer college and beach events and given away at radio stations. 90,000 pre-release posters and information sheets were mailed out to fans.
Blackman wrote the promotional piece for the album&#x27;s press kit, and at Konietzko&#x27;s request, wrote the first half of the promo as an insulting take down of the album rather than as a standard promo. The first letter of each line of the first section of the promo spelled out the phrase &quot;April Fools Day Fucker&quot; and included lines such as &quot;It&#x27;s been 100 years and fifty albums for the German/American rock squad—are they running out of gas or what?&quot; and &quot;KMFDM can&#x27;t suck hard enough&quot;, a quote from the track &quot;Inane&quot;. The second half of the promo included phrases such as &quot;&quot;XTORT&quot; is a supersonic soundtrack&quot; and &quot;The new album is the sound of a band at the height of their powers.&quot; Carrie Borzillo of &quot;Billboard&quot; stated KMFDM was &quot;poised to make a significant commercial breakthrough.&quot; Konietzko said at the time there were no plans to tour in support of the album&#x27;s release. He later said this was due to the fact that the band as a touring unit had ceased to exist.

&quot;Xtort&quot; was released on June 25, 1996 on Wax Trax!/TVT on cassette, CD, and vinyl. The album was also released in CD format in Europe and Japan. In addition to being the first KMFDM album to chart in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, staying there for three weeks and peaking at No. 92 the week of July 13, 1996, &quot;Xtort&quot; sold over 200,000 copies, making it one of the band&#x27;s best-selling albums. The song &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; was made into an animated video by visual artist Aidan &quot;Brute!&quot; Hughes, who also did the album&#x27;s cover artwork. On March 6, 2007, Metropolis Records released a digitally remastered version of the album on CD and MP3. Looking back on the album at the time of its re-release, Konietzko said it was his favorite album of the 1990s.

==Critical reception==

Reviews for &quot;Xtort&quot; were almost universally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;the heaviest and most danceable disc in [KMFDM&#x27;s] 12-year career&quot; while giving it an A−. Heidi MacDonald of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; compared &quot;Xtort&quot; to getting hit with a wrecking ball, saying, &quot;When KMFDM does what it does best, it is the best at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power.&quot; Sandy Masuo of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;the product of a first-rate lineup,&quot; and praised the album&#x27;s diversity, saying, &quot;The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM&#x27;s smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it&#x27;s the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist.&quot; Kevin M. Williams of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the album an &quot;essential&quot; rating, and said, &quot;KMFDM has some major mojo working with &quot;Xtort&quot;&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, &quot;it would be nice to hear [KMFDM] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more&quot;, and commenting that while &quot;Xtort&quot; did not sound much different from previous releases, &quot;KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best.&quot; Liz Armstrong of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs.

Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; said &quot;Power&quot;, the opening track, &quot;finds front man Sascha Konietzko snarling and growling with palpable force, while Cheryl Wilson softens the edges with splashes of soul-mama vamping during the chorus.&quot; Williams called the song &quot;irresistible&quot;. Masuo noted in particular the use of horns and the Hammond B3 organ, and concluded by stating, &quot;In their insidiously arty and intellectually sassy music, KMFDM continue to bring diverse elements together to create a unified whole.&quot; Armstrong called &quot;Dogma&quot; a song that crossed over from being industrial to &quot;frightening&quot;, while MacDonald described it as &quot;blistering&quot; and Williams said it was &quot;captivating&quot;. Armstrong said &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; was the album&#x27;s &quot;truly explosive track&quot;, but Williams thought &quot;Inane&quot; was the best song.

<doc id="550780" wikidata="Q4978563" url="?curid=550780" title="Wild Arms">
<text>, stylized as Wild ARMs, is a media franchise developed by Media.Vision and owned by Sony Computer Entertainment. The franchise consists of several role-playing video games and related media. Since the launch of the original &quot;Wild Arms&quot; title in 1996, the series has gone on to encompass several media, including toys, manga, mobile phone applications, and a 22-episode anime.

The series has largely been overseen by producer Akifumi Kaneko. It saw regular releases throughout the late 1990s and 2000s. Following its last major entry, &quot;Wild Arms XF&quot;, in 2007, it became dormant save for a crossover mobile game, &quot;Wild Arms: Million Memories&quot;, released a decade later. Kaneko crowdfunded an open world spiritual successor, &quot;Armed Fantasia&quot;, in 2022, alongside Naruke and other series veterans. The title is currently in development.

==Series development==
=== Production ===
&quot;Wild Arms&quot; was the first role-playing video game project of Media.Vision, a company that had been known primarily for their shooter game series &quot;Crime Crackers&quot; and &quot;Rapid Reload&quot;. Looking for a way to capitalize on the growing role-playing game market of the mid-1990s, Sony commissioned Media.Vision to create a game that would combine elements of a traditional RPG with limited 3D graphics to promote the hardware of their newly released PlayStation console. Supervised and designed primarily by Akifumi Kaneko and Takashi Fukushima, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Wild Arms&quot;, while still retaining traditional two-dimensional characters and backgrounds, became one of the first role-playing titles released to showcase 3D battle sequences.

Drawing inspiration from manga such as Yasuhiro Nightow&#x27;s &quot;Trigun&quot;, Kaneko and Fukushima crafted a video game world that resembles the contemporary fantasy environment seen in similar titles. References to seminal role-playing game elements influenced by European fantasy such as castles, magic, dragons, and monsters, were added to attract players to a familiar concept, as well as allow scenario writers from other projects. Other cultural and regional influences include Norse mythology, animism, and Japanese mythology.

===Music===
The background music of &quot;Wild Arms&quot; is reminiscent of Western films. The groundwork for the series&#x27; music was laid by composer Michiko Naruke, who had previously only written the scores to Super Nintendo Entertainment System titles. Recurring instrumentation includes acoustic guitars, mandolins, drums, woodwind and brass instruments, and pianos, accompanied by clapping and whistling samples. While classically influenced, the music of each game often diverges into other genres, including folk, rock, electronic, swing, and choral. Naruke composed the soundtracks for the first three &quot;Wild Arms&quot; titles herself, yet she contributed to the soundtrack for &quot;Wild Arms 4&quot; along with Nobuyuki Shimizu, Ryuta Suzuki, and Masato Kouda, who emulated her now-established style. Music for &quot;Wild Arms 5&quot;, the only video game title where Naruke did not contribute, was provided by Kouda along with series newcomer Noriyasu Agematsu.

==Recurring themes==

The usage of firearms factors heavily into the &quot;Wild Arms&quot; mythos. Called &quot;ARMs&quot;, these weapons are often associated with ancient technology and represent a more violent and warlike age; thus, a social stigma is often given to anyone possessing or using them. Though the exact nature varies from one game to the next, they are seen as highly destructive devices with an array of functions in battle. The practical usage of ARMs, either to protect or destroy life, is left to the user&#x27;s discretion, and serves as a plot point within each game to establish a character&#x27;s true motives.

Environmentalism is also a key factor in many &quot;Wild Arms&quot; games, which often center around the restoration of the environment that has long since been tainted, either by warfare or natural phenomena. The governing forces of the planet are personified as &quot;Guardians&quot;, spirit-like anthropomorphic creatures who act as the gods of natural aspects such as water, fire, and wind, along with human traits such as love, hope, and courage. The primary heroes of each game often ally themselves with these Guardians to defeat technology-reliant or ecologically unconscious villains who would either subjugate or destroy the world to suit their respective goals.
===Setting===
Each &quot;Wild Arms&quot; story takes place on a planet called Filgaia, though each &quot;Filgaia&quot; appears to be an entirely separate world with a different arrangement of continents, in similar tradition to the discontinuity between games of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Filgaia is a fantasy world containing a variety of terrain, including deserts, red rock canyons, plains, forests, mountainous regions, grasslands, and Arctic tundras, though their predominance varies from one game to the next. Though human towns and cities are plentiful, the wilderness that encompasses most of the landscape is riddled with monsters and other beasts, as well as ruins or dungeons from earlier eras that house ancient treasures inaccessible to all but skilled adventurers. Filgaia is also home to a number of different races including the Native American-inspired Baskars, nature-dwelling Elws, and vampiric Crimson Nobles.

===Elw===

The Elw (pronounced el-loo) are a demi-human race who appear human, with the exception of their long ears. Because of their close relationship with nature, the Elw live exceptionally long lives. Due to the destruction of the environment, the Elw population is extremely low.

The Elw were the original inhabitants of Filgaia. When the neosapiens (humans) migrated to Filgaia after a war on their home world, the Elw kindly accepted them.

Around a thousand years before the events of &quot;Wild Arms&quot;, Filgaia was invaded by a race known as the Metal Demons. The Elw joined together with the other inhabitants of Filgaia, the humans and Guardians, in order to expel the invaders. Eventually, the Metal Demon leader &quot;Mother&quot; was defeated and the Metal Demons were pushed back to the northernmost part of Filgaia.

During the war, the Elw developed many weapons using their knowledge of magic, alchemy, and technology. Most of these weapons later became known as ARMs. The Elw also created the large humanoid machines called Golems. The Golems proved very useful during the first Demon War. However, the Golems were unreliable because they determined friend and foe based on whoever was operating them. This flaw was later exploited by the Metal Demons during the second Demon War and was the main reason the Elws created the Holmcross. The Elw created the Holmcross using living metal based on the Metal Demons&#x27;. The Holmcross went on a rampage, and all but one were destroyed by the Elw. The final weapon the Elw created was the Guardian Blade. When the Guardian Blade was activated, it sucked the vitality out of part of the planet and started the decay that would slowly turn Filgaia into a barren wasteland that would soon be impossible for the Elw, who were dependent on nature, to live on. This and the Elw distrust of humans led to the creation of the Elw Dimension and the Elw&#x27;s evacuation of Filgaia. The last known Elw founded Baskar village.

===Ragu O Ragula===
A recurring optional boss enemy throughout the series is the legendary Ragu O Ragula, known as the &quot;King of the Monsters&quot;. He is strongly hinted at being an alien lifeform, as he has &quot;traveled the stars&quot;. In each &quot;Wild ARMs&quot; game, he is the ultimate extra boss. In games in which the Abyss — a sometimes ridiculously long optional dungeon that appears in many of the games — is present, he will be at the end of that dungeon. The player is not often given many clues to find him, but he is always alluded to in a few bookshelves throughout the game. When defeated, Ragu usually bestows upon the player the iconic Sheriff Star accessory, which not only proves the player&#x27;s valor, but also tends to make the remainder of the game quite easy when equipped due to its effects. This trend was broken in &quot;Wild Arms 5&quot;, in which when defeated, Ragu drops a badge called &quot;The Omega&quot;.

== Games ==

=== Main series ===
As a Sony franchise, all &quot;Wild Arms&quot; video games appear exclusively on PlayStation video game consoles. Each individual title is set in the world of Filgaia and contains several consistencies that have become series mainstays, including similar races, monsters, technologies, and plot points. Only two of the titles directly allude to any chronology, as each game bears a Filgaia unrecognizable from each prior title.

* Wild Arms established many of the recurring themes seen in later installments, including the desert world of Filgaia, and gun-like machinery called &quot;ARMs&quot;. It introduced the &quot;tool&quot; system, in which special items such as bombs or grappling hooks can be used out of combat to cross otherwise impassable terrain and destroy objects. Originally released in Japan for the PlayStation in 1996, the game was published in North America and the PAL region over the next two years by Sony Computer Entertainment. &quot;Wild Arms&quot; features two-dimensional characters and environments for normal gameplay, while battle sequences are instead rendered in full 3D. The game follows the adventures of a band of &quot;Dream Chasers&quot;, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia, as they make their way across the desert-like world of Filgaia. Contacted by the Avatars of the forces of nature that protect the world, the heroes are chosen to be humankind&#x27;s champions in the face of a demon invasion.
* Wild Arms 2, the sequel to the first &quot;Wild Arms&quot;, was the second and final title for the original PlayStation. While keeping many of the themes from the previous title, &quot;Wild Arms 2&quot; introduced additional science fiction elements, including more abundant high technology and cybernetics, with additional fantasy and steampunk themes. A total of six characters can be recruited, with the player able to switch between any of them at any time. While characters remained in 2D, environments such as dungeons and towns were now rendered in isometric 3D. &quot;Wild Arms 2&quot; involves a group of international peace-keepers known as &quot;Operation ARMS&quot; that are assigned by a wealthy benefactor to protect the world from the terrorist organization Odessa. The player assumes control of each member of ARMS as they make their way through the game, and eventually confront an ancient evil that once threatened to destroy all of Filgaia.
* Wild Arms 3 is the first &quot;Wild Arms&quot; game for the PlayStation 2 console and the first title to be presented entirely using 3D cel-shaded graphics. Though combat remains turn-based, a minor addition to the battle system, the &quot;crossfire sequence&quot;, gives the appearance that characters and enemies are moving around the battlefield between rounds. The game takes place on a desert world almost totally devoid of large bodies of water, where roving bands of adventurers and outlaws roam the land in search of vast fortune, either through robberies or treasure hunting. Four strangers united by circumstance, Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows are the main characters who must confront a group of mystics trying to revive the world, and a demon who would have it destroyed.
*Wild Arms Alter Code: F was released for the PlayStation 2 as an enhanced remake of the original &quot;Wild Arms&quot;. It features an expanded script, additional story sequences, and a re-recorded soundtrack by Naruke. While all the previous locations from the initial version return, they are now presented in full 3D with new layouts and puzzles. New gameplay additions from &quot;Wild Arms 3&quot; include the Migrant System for avoiding battles, and the Crossfire Sequence added to combat.
* Wild Arms 4, also released for the PlayStation 2, takes a more action game-like approach to the series, including environments that only allow horizontal movement, and the ability to run, jump, and slide past obstacles. The tool system is absent for the first time, and combat sequences are handled dramatically different from previous games. Utilizing the &quot;Hex System&quot;, battlefields are now made up of seven equally-sized hexagons that characters may move between each combat round, allowing the player to attack enemies or aid allies stationed in adjacent hexes. The story follows the journey of Jude, a young boy from an isolated village who is the unwilling owner of a secretly-developed ARM weapon and now on the run from the government. He is joined by his companions Yulie, Arnaud, and Raquel as they embark on a quest to re-unite Jude with his mother, as well as defeat a number of superhuman government agents with a hidden plot involving the safety of the world.
* Wild Arms 5, the final title for the PlayStation 2, makes further use of &quot;Wild Arms 4&#x27;s&quot; HEX combat system with minor adjustments, including a combat party of no more than three characters. Released in Japan in December 2006, the game was released in North America by XSEED Games in August 2007. A PAL-region version was published by 505 Games in limited quantities only available in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The story concerns Dean Stark, a 16-year-old adventurer from a village specializing in collecting lost technology, and his friend Rebecca who discover a mysterious amnesiac young woman named Avril outside town. The duo agrees to help Avril in her quest to recover her memory, while Dean commits himself to learning how to use ARMs so he may one day become a successful &quot;Golem Hunter&quot;, a finder of ancient robotic giants.
* Wild Arms XF is the series&#x27; first handheld title, developed for the PlayStation Portable. Unlike the other titles, it is a tactical role-playing game. The story centers around Clarissa Arwin, the leader of the Chevalet Blanc knights, who is swept up into a political war when she travels to the Kingdom of Elesius to retrieve her mother&#x27;s sword.

===Mobile===
Wild Arms Mobile is a series of Flash-based mobile phone games distributed by Yahoo! Keitai, I-Mode, and EZWeb for the NTT DoCoMo cellphone brand in Japan. First developed in 2006, the download-to-play service includes two &quot;Wild Arms&quot;-themed minigames: a &quot;Tetris&quot;-style puzzle game, and &quot;Wild Arms Kōya no Nichō Kenjū&quot;, a shooting game featuring characters and locations from &quot;Wild Arms 3&quot;. Additional downloadable features include backgrounds, calendar skins, music, and visual styles based on several &quot;Wild Arms&quot; games. A routine news feed can also be accessed with information from Sony Computer Entertainment.

&quot;Wild Arms: Million Memories&quot; was released for smart phones in Japan on September 26, 2018. The game was developed by ForwardWorks and features characters from various &quot;Wild Arms&quot; games. The game was shut down February 27, 2020.

=== Spiritual successor ===
&quot;Armed Fantasia&quot;, a crowdfunded indie spiritual successor to the series, was announced in 2022 by Kaneko, who had not developed a game in the 15 years since &quot;Wild Arms XF&quot;. Developed by Wild Bunch Productions, its music is planned to be composed by Elements Garden and long-time series composers such as Michiko Naruke. It was fully funded in a &quot;double Kickstarter&quot; along with the &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot;-inspired JRPG &quot;Penny Blood&quot;. &quot;Armed Fantasia&quot; is planned to include an open-world environment, but with a story-driven approach. The game includes the ability to chain attacks for both players and enemies.

The game takes place in a world afflicted by desertification and governed by the Order of the Sacred Key, which fights creatures known as Anomalies using powerful ARM weapons. The three main characters of &quot;Armed Fantasia&quot; are wandering Anomaly fighters dubbed Pathfinders, akin to Drifters in &quot;Wild Arms&quot;. They include 17-year-old street-smart protagonist Ingram Goodweather, 19-year-old Order knight Alicia Fairhead, and Euclid Sturges, a highly-intelligent 18-year-old mage.

== Other media ==

===Manga===

First appearing in the Japanese &quot;Magazine Z&quot; in 2001, &quot;Wild Arms Hana Nusubito&quot;, or Wild ARMs: Flower Thieves, is a 187-page manga commissioned by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan published by Kodansha. The manga features artwork by Wakako Ōba and contains plot elements from the first two &quot;Wild Arms&quot; titles, though it is set in its own unique world. &quot;Flower Thieves&quot; takes place thousands of years after a war between humans and demons destroyed much of the life on the planet, turning the world into a scorched wasteland. Set in a dystopian future, the manga features a large group of humans on their last legs, living in the overcrowded city of Upper Hose where flowers and other flora are rare and valuable. When a plant-eating monster known as a &quot;Flower Thief&quot; attacks a mysterious girl named Jechika, a young boy, Maxi, must use a forbidden ARM weapon to save her, and is subsequently expelled from the city for using illegal technology. Traveling into the wilderness with Jechika and a florist named Gi, Maxi sets off on a quest to restore the balance of nature throughout the world and make the earth habitable again.

Beginning with &quot;Wild Arms 2&quot; in 1999, official adaptations of each &quot;Wild Arms&quot; game were produced by such manga companies as DNA Media, Enix, Bros. Comics, GanGan Wing, and 4Kings for release exclusively in Japan. Each work follows the plot of each game it is based on, with minor interpretations to the original script and characters.

===Anime===
Wild Arms: Twilight Venom is a 22-episode anime series originally broadcast on Japan&#x27;s WOWOW network from October 1999 to March 2000 produced by Studio Bee Train. Directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and Kōichi Mashimo, the series follows the adventures of two treasure hunters—Loretta, an aspiring sorceress and Mirabelle, a Crimson Noble—who stumble upon the body of Sheyenne Rainstorm, a warrior from the past reborn as a 10-year-old boy. Able to use the archaic yet powerful ARM devices found with him, Sheyenne and the others team up with gung-ho scientist Dr. Aronnax to discover the secret of his past. The series features music by Kow Otani and Sho Wada, as well as themes from the first two &quot;Wild Arms&quot; games.

===Albums===

In addition to commercial soundtracks for each individual game and the anime, two sets of arranged albums have been released featuring music from multiple games in the &quot;Wild Arms&quot; series. The compilation album &quot;Alone the World: Wild Arms Vocal Collection&quot;, released in July 2002, features all vocal tracks from the first three &quot;Wild Arms&quot; titles, as well as sung versions of previously instrumental songs provided by Kaori Asoh.

In celebration of the &quot;Wild Arms&quot; series 10th anniversary, Media.Vision and King Records produced two separate albums under the &quot;Wild Arms: Music the Best&quot; label which feature music from the first four &quot;Wild Arms&quot; games as well as the &quot;Twilight Venom&quot; anime. The first album, &quot;Feeling Wind&quot;, released August 2006, contains piano interpretations of various songs performed by Haruki Mino and Fumito Hirata and arranged by Yasuo Sako, and came packaged with a special edition songbook entitled &quot;Piece of Tears&quot; featuring liner notes for each track as well as interviews with long-time series composer Michiko Naruke. The second album, &quot;Rocking Heart&quot;, released the following October, is a rock and jazz-inspired remix album featuring arrangements by Nittoku Inoue, Nobuhiko Kashiwara, Nao Tokisawa, Atsushi Tomita, Transquillo, and Ryo Yonemitsu.

==Reception==
Bryan Cebulski of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; praised the original &quot;Wild Arms&quot;, stating that &quot;where every sequel is thrown off balance by its flaws, the original is exactly what it wants to be: An uncomplicated mid-sized JRPG&quot;. He also said that the reoccurring Baskar tribe were some of the only playable equivalents to Native Americans in JRPGs outside of &quot;Shadow Hearts: From the New World&quot;. He called Michiko Naruke’s compositions &quot;gorgeous&quot; and said that despite their drawing upon Western film soundtracks, they fit very well into the RPG setting.

Cebulski stated his opinion that &quot;Wild Arms 2&quot; was the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the franchise, featuring an unusually mature and ambitious plot and themes that resembles the game &quot;Xenogears&quot; and the later works of Yoko Taro, but a narrative which is &quot;confused, at times even totally incomprehensible&quot;. He also criticized the story&#x27;s lack of urgency and the villains&#x27; lack of clearly defined actions and motives, and concluded that the game &quot;wants to be something postmodern and complex, subversive and dynamic in a way it just never shows itself being.&quot;

Cebulski said that &quot;Wild Arms 3&quot;, which lowered the amount of medieval fantasy and steampunk influence, was superior to its predecessors, saying that it was the game he recommends to new players in order to get a feel for the series due to its better pace and more competent localization than the second game. He said the characters are &quot;tremendously endearing&quot; and called protagonist Virginia Maxwell surprisingly progressive due to her optimism and naivety. However, he said the combat is &quot;tedious because they’re random battles&quot; and found it annoying that most bosses cannot be defeated in a straightforward manner, though he acknowledged this keeps the game from becoming too easy. He called its successor a &quot;jarring change&quot; to a more heavily sci-fi &quot;mecha anime&quot; setting, but one that was needed and welcome due to its older mechanics having peaked and run out of new ways to explore. He called &quot;Wild Arms 5&quot; &quot;a streamlined culmination of all the series has to offer ... [which] pays homage to the core of what made the series remarkable as it introduces new and sometimes improved mechanics&quot;, particularly mentioning how the ability to place hexes in formations other than hexagonal enables numerous new combinations and strategies and how the overworld allows sufficient exploration without making the game lag, but said that the series as a whole was &quot;petering out&quot;.

In 2012, Kimberley Wallace of &quot;Game Informer&quot; called &quot;Wild Arms&quot; a &quot;lost RPG franchise&quot;, saying the odds of a new game in the series were 25:1 due to sales potentially not meeting Sony&#x27;s expectations.

<text>Water resources law (in some jurisdictions, shortened to &quot;water law&quot;) is the field of law dealing with the ownership, control, and use of water as a resource. It is most closely related to property law, and is distinct from laws governing water quality.

== Waters subject to regulation ==

Water is ubiquitous and does not respect political boundaries. Water resources laws may apply to any portion of the hydrosphere over which claims may be made to appropriate or maintain the water to serve some purpose. Such waters include, but are not limited to:

*Surface waters—lakes, rivers, streams, oceans, and wetlands;
*Surface runoff—generally water that flows across the land from rain, floodwaters, and snowmelt before those waters reach watercourses, lakes, wetlands, or oceans;
*Groundwater—particularly water present in aquifers.

==History==

The history of people&#x27;s relation to water illustrates varied approaches to the management of water resources. &quot;Lipit Ishtar and Ur Nammu both contain water provisions, pre-date Hammurabi by at least 250 years, and clearly provide the normative underpinnings on which the Hammurabi Code was constructed.&quot; The Code of Hammurabi was one of the earliest written laws to deal with water issues, and this code included the administration of water use. At the time the code was written in ancient Mesopotamia, the civilizations in the surrounding lands were dependent on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to survive. As a result, the leaders needed to develop intricate canal and irrigation systems to sustain their needs for the water. The code was developed about 3,800 years ago by King Hammurabi of Babylonia.

==Difficulties of water rights==
Water is uniquely difficult to regulate, because laws are designed mainly for land. Water is mobile, its supply varies by year, season, and location, and it can be used simultaneously by many entities. As with property law, water rights can be described as a &quot;bundle of sticks&quot; containing multiple, separable activities that can have varying levels of regulation. For instance, some uses of water divert it from its natural course but return most or all of it (e.g. hydroelectric plants), while others consume much of what they take (ice, agriculture), and still others use water without diverting it at all (e.g. boating). Each type of activity has its own needs and can in theory be regulated separately. There are several types of conflict likely to arise: absolute shortages; shortages in a particular time or place, diversions of water that reduce the flow available to others, pollutants or other changes (such as temperature or turbidity) that render water unfit for others&#x27; use, and the need to maintain &quot;in-stream flows&quot; of water to protect the natural ecosystem.

One theory of history, put forward in Karl August Wittfogel&#x27;s book &quot;Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power&quot;, holds that many empires were organized around a central authority that controlled a population through monopolizing the water supply. Such a hydraulic empire creates the potential for despotism, and serves as a cautionary tale for designing water regulations.

Water law involves controversy in some parts of the world where a growing population faces increasing competition over a limited natural supply. Disputes over rivers, lakes and underground aquifers cross national borders. Although water law is still regulated mainly by individual countries, there are international sets of proposed rules such as the Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers and the Hague Declaration on Water Security in the 21st Century.

Long-term issues in water law include the possible effects of global warming on rainfall patterns and evaporation; the availability and cost of desalination technology; the control of pollution; and the growth of aquaculture.

== Legal models ==
The legal right to use a designated water supply is known as a water right. There are two major models used for water rights. The first is riparian rights, where the owner of the adjacent land has the right to the water in the body next to it. The other major model is the prior appropriations model, the first party to make use of a water supply has the first rights to it, regardless of whether the property is near the water source. Riparian systems are generally more common in areas where water is plentiful, while appropriations systems are more common in dry climates. As water resource law is complex, many areas have a combination of the two models.

==Water law by country==

=== International law ===
The right to use water to satisfy basic human needs for personal and domestic uses has been protected under international human rights law. When incorporated in national legal frameworks, this right is articulated to other water rights within the broader body of water law. The human right to water has been recognized in international law through a wide range of international documents, including international human rights treaties, declarations and other standards. Additionally, the United Nations passed a resolution stating that the member states &quot;recognizes the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights.&quot;

The human right to water places the main responsibilities upon governments to ensure that people can enjoy &quot;sufficient, safe, accessible and affordable water, without discrimination&quot;. Most especially, governments are expected to take reasonable steps to avoid a contaminated water supply and to ensure there are no water access distinctions amongst citizens. Today all states have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognizes the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognizing this right.

===Canada===
Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, jurisdiction over waterways is divided between the federal and provincial governments. Federal jurisdiction is derived from the powers to regulate navigation and shipping, fisheries, and the governing of the northern territories, which has resulted in the passage of:

:* the &quot;Fisheries Act&quot;,
:* the &quot;Navigation Protection Act&quot;,
:* the &quot;Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act&quot;, and
:* the &quot;Oceans Act&quot;.

Provincial jurisdiction is derived from the powers over property and civil rights, matters of a local and private nature, and management of Crown lands. In Ontario, Quebec and other provinces, the beds of all navigable waters are vested in the Crown, in contrast to English law. All provincial governments also govern water quality through laws on environmental protection and drinking water, such as the &quot;Clean Water Act&quot; in Ontario.

===Australia===
Water law in Australia varies with each state.

In the state of New South Wales, water laws are enforced by an independent regulatory body; the Natural Resources Access Regulator. 

==== Tasmania ====
The Tasmanian Water Corporation compulsorily acquired all drinking water supply infrastructure previously managed by local councils This policy was not popular with all local councillors.

===Iran===
Seventh program of Iranian government in 2023-22 ordered the preparing and deployment of a new the bureau of unified water resource administration system.

===Water law in the United States===
In the United States there are complex legal systems for allocating water rights that vary by region. These varying systems exist for both historical and geographic reasons. Water law encompasses a broad array of subjects or categories designed to provide a framework to resolve disputes and policy issues relating to water:

*Public waters, including tidal waters and navigable waterways.
*Other surface waters—generally water that flows across non-public land from rain, floodwaters, and snowmelt before those waters reach public watercourses.
*Groundwater, sometimes called subterranean, percolating, or underground water
*Public regulation of waters, including flood control, environmental regulation—state and federal, public health regulation and regulation of fisheries
*Related to all of the above is interplay of public and private rights in water, which draws on aspects of eminent domain law and the federal commerce clause powers
*Water project law: the highly developed law regarding the formation, operation, and finance of public and quasi-public entities which operate local public works of flood control, navigation control, irrigation, and avoidance of environmental degradation
*Treaty Rights of Native Americans

The law governing these topics comes from all layers of law. Some derives from common law principles which have developed over centuries, and which evolve as the nature of disputes presented to courts change. For example, the judicial approach to landowner rights to divert surface waters has changed significantly in the last century as public attitudes about land and water have evolved. Some derives from state statutory law. Some derives from the original public grants of land to the States and from the documents of their origination. Some derives from state, federal and local regulation of waters through zoning, public health and other regulation. Non-federally recognized Indian tribes do not have water rights.

Many states in the Midwestern US, such as Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, employ a riparian system of law when it comes to water resources.

===Water law in England and Wales ===
Private companies are obliged to publish annually a sizeable report providing a relevant amount of nationwide comparable data on costs, revenues, profits, and performance levels. An independent regulatory authority of the water industry sector analyzes private companies outcomes and sets an allowed level of return which is not fixed and incentive-based.
Privatizations in the UK were driven by an historical under-investment on an asset-intensive sector.

===Water law in the European Union===
For countries within the European Union, water-related directives are important for water resource management and environmental and water quality standards. Key directives include the Urban Waste Water Directive 1992 (requiring most towns and cities to treat their wastewater to specified standards), and the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, which requires water resource plans based on river basins, including public participation based on Aarhus Convention principles. See Watertime — the international context, Section 2.

<doc id="550788" wikidata="Q312638" url="?curid=550788" title="Franco Alfano">
<text>Franco Alfano (8 March 1875 – 27 October 1954) was an Italian composer and pianist, best known today for his operas &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1936) and &quot;Risurrezione&quot; (1904), and for having completed Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Turandot&quot; in 1926. He had considerable success with several of his own works during his lifetime.

==Career==
Alfano was born in Posillipo, Naples. He attended piano lessons given privately by Alessandro Longo, and harmony and composition respectively under Camillo de Nardis (1857–1951) and Paolo Serrao at the Conservatory San Pietro a Majella in Naples. Later, after graduating, in 1895 he pursued further composition studies with Hans Sitt and Salomon Jadassohn in Leipzig. While working there he met his idol, Edvard Grieg, and wrote numerous piano and orchestral pieces.

From 1918 he was Director of the Conservatory of Bologna, from 1923 Director of the Turin Conservatory, and from 1947 to 1950 Director of the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro. Alfano died in San Remo.

==Operas==
Alfano completed his first opera, &quot;Miranda&quot; (unpublished), for which he also wrote the libretto based on a novel by Antonio Fogazzaro, in 1896. His work &quot;La Fonte di Enschir&quot; (libretto by Luigi Illica) was refused by Ricordi but was presented in Wrocław (then Breslau) as &quot;Die Quelle von Enschir&quot; on 8 November 1898. It enjoyed some success.

There followed the opera &quot;Risurrezione&quot; in 1904. It was based on Tolstoy, and the lead soprano role of Katerina Mihaylovna was later sung by Magda Olivero.

&quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; followed. This based on the famous play by Edmond Rostand and composed to the French libretto by Henri Cain. It had its Italian premiere in Rome in January 1936 and its French premiere in Paris four months later. It was recently revived by the Kiel Opera (Germany), the Montpellier Radio Festival (France) and the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, starring Plácido Domingo in the title role.

In 1921, &quot;La Leggenda di Sakùntala&quot; appeared, described by some as his most important stage work, and while it was successful enough to have Arturo Toscanini recommend Alfano for the completion of Puccini&#x27;s posthumous Turandot, the performance materials were thought destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War. Alfano reconstructed it in 1952 as &quot;Sakùntala&quot;, after &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot; (&quot;The Recognition of Sakuntala&quot;), the Sanskrit play by Kālidāsa. Subsequently, the original version was recovered in 2005, with the two versions available for performance today. The second version of Sakùntala was performed in New York City by Teatro Grattacielo in the fall of 2013.

==Historical perspectives==
In &quot;Fanfare&quot;″s issue of September/October 1999, it was asserted that Alfano&#x27;s reputation suffers because of several things. Firstly, that he should not be judged as a composer on the basis of the task he was given in completing &quot;Turandot&quot; (La Scala, 25 April 1926). Secondly, that we almost never hear everything he wrote for &quot;Turandot&quot; since the standard ending heavily edits Alfano&#x27;s work. Thirdly, […] it is not his conclusion that is performed in productions of &quot;Turandot&quot; but only what the premiere conductor Arturo Toscanini included from it […] Puccini had worked for nine months on the following concluding duet and at his death had left behind a whole ream of sketches […] Alfano had to reconstruct […] according to his best assessment […] and with his imagination and magnifying glass&quot; since Puccini&#x27;s material &quot;had not really been legible&quot;.

&quot;Alfano&#x27;s reputation has also suffered [IC:along with Mascagni], understandably, because of his willingness to associate himself closely with Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist government.&quot;

Alex Ross, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, notes that a new ending of &quot;Turandot&quot; composed by Luciano Berio premiered in 2002 is preferred by some critics for making a more satisfactory resolution of Turandot&#x27;s change of heart, and of being more in keeping with Puccini&#x27;s evolving technique.

<text>National Australia Bank Limited (abbreviated NAB, branded and stylised as nab) is one of the four largest financial institutions in Australia (colloquially referred to as &quot;The Big Four&quot;) in terms of market capitalisation, earnings and customers. NAB was ranked the world&#x27;s 21st-largest bank measured by market capitalisation and 52nd-largest bank in the world as measured by total assets in 2019.

, NAB operated 3,500 Bank@Post locations—including 7,000+ ATMs across Australia, New Zealand, and Asia—and served 9 million customers.

NAB has an &quot;AA−&quot; long-term issuer rating by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s.

==History==

===1982–1999===
National Australia Bank was formed as National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Limited in 1982 by the merger of National Bank of Australasia and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. The resulting company was subsequently renamed National Australia Bank Limited.

The expanded financial base of the merged entity triggered significant offshore expansion over ensuing years. Representative offices were established in Beijing (1982), Chicago (1982), Dallas (1983), Seoul (1983, upgraded to a branch in 1990), San Francisco (1984), Kuala Lumpur (1984), Athens (1984, closed 1989), Frankfurt (1985, closed 1992), Atlanta (1986), Bangkok (1986), Taipei (1986 upgraded to branch 1990), Shanghai (1988, closed 1990), Houston (1989) and New Delhi (1989).

In 1987, NAB bought Clydesdale Bank (Scotland) and Northern Bank (Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland) from Midland Bank. It rebranded Northern Bank branches in the Republic of Ireland to National Irish Bank and changed both banks&#x27; logos from that of the Midland Bank. In 1990, NAB bought Yorkshire Bank (England and Wales).

In 1992, NAB purchased the Bank of New Zealand, which became a subsidiary of the Australian bank, but retained local governance, with a New Zealand board of directors. At some point, a business entity known as Bank of New Zealand in Australia (BNZA) was absorbed by NAB.

Further acquisitions followed – which at the time had about a 26% market share in the market, and Michigan National Bank (MNB) in 1995. NAB had earlier rationalised its operations in the US and closed its offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and San Francisco in 1991.

This period of rapid expansion through acquisition concluded with the purchases in 1997 of HomeSide Lending, a leading US mortgage originator and servicer based in Florida, and most significantly, the acquisition in 2000 of MLC Limited (and related entities) for $4.56bn, one of the biggest mergers in Australian corporate history.

=== 2000s ===
NAB encountered a difficult period in the period 2000–2005. In 2000, NAB sold Michigan National Bank to ABN AMRO, then in 2001 sold HomeSide&#x27;s operating assets for US$1.9b to Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan company, as well as the mortgage unit&#x27;s loan-servicing technology and operating platform.

The foreign currency trader fraud was the catalyst for the resignations of CEO Frank Cicutto and Chairman Charles Allen. The resignations were preceded by a Board revolt where Catherine Walters emerged as a whistle blower citing serious culture issues at the company having led to the string of failures.

Frank Cicutto was CEO of NAB from 1999 to 2004. The Australian economic environment during his leadership was stable and productive after 17 consecutive years of economic growth since 1992, averaging 3.3 per cent per annum.

In February 2004, John Stewart was appointed CEO of NAB following the sacking of Cicutto. Stewart proceeded with a far reaching re-organisation of the company along regional lines leading to the appointment of Ahmed Fahour as the CEO of Australia in September 2004. On 20 February 2009 Fahour stepped down from the principal board and group executive committee.

In 2005, NAB announced a cut of 2,000 Australian jobs as part of a global cost-cutting program with the intention of cutting around 4,200 positions – about 10.5% of its total workforce globally.

It began to outsource back office positions offshore, beginning with a pilot with 23 jobs from the accounts payable department in Melbourne going to Bangalore, India in an agreement with Accenture. Later that year, it sold Northern Bank and National Irish Bank to the Danish Danske Bank. Over 200 additional jobs had been sent offshore by 2006.

As part of the culture change program, a new Australian head office was purpose built at Docklands in Melbourne. This building is characterised by its open plan layout and was officially opened in October 2004. After Cameron Clyne became CEO in 2009, the Docklands building became the global headquarters replacing 500 Bourke Street.

By 2006, NAB had turned its fortunes around, reporting an industry record $4.3 billion profit and winning two local Bank of the Year awards. It also had a major reform which included the refurbishment of all of its branches, and the replacement of signage in and around National branches and buildings, being changed from &#x27;National&#x27; to &#x27;nab&#x27;.

In May 2007, NAB announced that it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange, and this took place in August 2007. NAB delisted from the London and Tokyo exchanges in 2006.

In March 2008, NAB announced that it would send maintenance and support for some core banking applications to India through an offshoring arrangement with Infosys and Satyam, affecting another 260 employees.

On 25 July 2008, NAB&#x27;s announcement of an additional A$830 million provision associated with deterioration in US real estate markets triggered the biggest single-day fall in its share price in 21 years, wiping over A$7 billion from the stock&#x27;s value.

In October 2008, NAB launched a branchless direct bank trading separately as UBank under the leadership of Greg Sutherland and Gerd Schenkel.

In January 2009, Cameron Clyne became CEO, and began a strategy of reputation change, wealth management and a focus on domestic markets.

As part of this strategy, NAB&#x27;s underweight retail bank – under the leadership of Lisa Gray – attempted to increase market share by competing on price and cutting fees. Initially denting earnings in the division, the strategy produced mixed results over the medium term, with cash earnings, market share and customer satisfaction rising, but operating margin and cost to income ratio worsening since it began in 2009. In line with the strategy, NAB attempted to differentiate itself from the other &quot;Big 4&quot; Australian banks in a large, national public relations campaign centred around a theme of &quot;breaking up&quot; with the other banks on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011. The campaign received both a positive and negative reception. It also attracted swift competitive responses from other major banks. The campaign won an advertising award at Cannes.

In 2009, NAB acquired the mortgage business of Challenger Financial Services for $385 million, in order to boost its market share in the broker channel. The purchase also included the PLAN, Choice, and FAST mortgage aggregation businesses and approximately 17.5% in Homeloans Ltd. In June that year it paid A$825m ($660m:£401m) for UK insurer Aviva&#x27;s Australian wealth management businesses, including their &quot;Navigator&quot; platform. NAB beat off competition from AMP for Navigator. news In July 2009 NAB acquired an 80% stake in the private wealth management division of Goldman Sachs JBWere, for A$99m.

In December 2009 NAB began a nine month attempt to purchase Axa Asia Pacific. This attempt was blocked twice by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission. The first time, in April 2010, was because the regulator believed that the merger would cause a substantial lessening of competition in the retail investment platform market. NAB subsequently lodged a revised bid which aimed to address these concerns but was rejected a second time in September of that year. The Axa deal&#x27;s drawn out process drew criticism for the bank&#x27;s underperformance.

=== 2010s ===
NAB&#x27;s poor 2012 financial results called its strategy into question: net profit dropped by 22% compared to the previous year. In 2014, the NAB Melbourne Government announced that Cameron Clyne would be succeeded as CEO by Andrew Thorburn, NAB&#x27;s New Zealand head. In August 2014, Lisa Gray left NAB as part of a broader set of executive changes.

As part of a strategy to focus NAB on its domestic markets, the bank listed its US subsidiary, Great Western Bank, on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2014 as part of an initial public offering. NAB sold its final 28.5% holding in Great Western in July 2015.
In May 2015, NAB also confirmed it would demerge its Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank business in the UK, through an initial public offering. The business was partially floated on the London Stock Exchange and Australian Securities Exchange under a new holding company, The CYBG plc, in February 2016, with the remaining shares distributed to NAB&#x27;s shareholders.

In July 2019, Ross McEwan was appointed group chief executive officer and managing director, after resigning from the Royal Bank of Scotland in April of that year.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2021, NAB announced plans to acquire the neobank 86 400 for $220 million and subsequently merge it with UBank.

In May 2021, NAB completed its sale of its advice, platforms, superannuation and investments and asset management businesses to IOOF Holdings. As part of the MLC Wealth Transaction, NAB retained the companies that operated the advice businesses.

In September 2021, NAB temporarily rebranded their logo to JAB to promote vaccines for COVID-19.

In the first half of 2022, NAB relocated its global headquarters from 800 Bourke Street Docklands to a new natural light and greenery purpose built 39 storey building at 395 Bourke Street. The move also replaced National Bank House at 500 Bourke Street. The bank currently has 2 main buildings for employees at 700 Bourke Street Docklands and the new 395 NAB Place.

On 1 June 2022, National Australia Bank Limited (NAB) acquired the consumer banking business from Citigroup Pty Ltd (Citi), an Australian branch of Citibank.

On 19 January 2023, NAB announced that it would create a stablecoin called the AUDN that would be pegged to the Australian Dollar, and that the digital asset would be on the Ethereum network. The objective is to streamline cross-border banking transactions, and will also be used for trading carbon credits. AUDN is expected to be live in mid-2023.

===Overview===

The National Australia Bank Group is organised into eight divisions, spread across two geographic regions.

===Technology===

NAB is a large user of the Siebel and Teradata CRM systems. While NAB has received recognition as an early adopter and leader in CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
the system was reinvigorated in 2004–5 as part of the broader turnaround to support the new focus on cross-selling.

In 2006, NAB was named the winner of the IFS/Cap Gemini Financial Innovation awards for its CRM system, internally called &quot;National Leads&quot;.

On 25 November 2010, NAB suffered a system malfunction resulting in the failure of accounts processing. As a result, around 60,000 banking transactions were lost, and had to be manually recovered. The malfunction was caused by a corruption of an irreplaceable system file. This issue has been dubbed by some commentators as one of the biggest failures in the history of the Australian banking system.

Under Cameron Clyne&#x27;s leadership, NAB began to upgrade its core banking platform in a project dubbed &quot;NextGen&quot;. The project involves the replacement of its legacy systems which are up to 40 years old with an Oracle-based solution. UBank was reported to be the first beneficiary of this project. In total, the project was expected to be completed in 2014 and cost $1 billion.

As of April 2014, NAB&#x27;s &quot;NextGen&quot; program was said to suffer from &quot;growing problems&quot;.

In July 2020, NAB signed an agreement with Microsoft to further develop its multi-cloud computing strategy including the migration of key applications to the cloud while accelerating development and innovation.

In September 2020, The National Australia Bank partnered with crowdsource security firm Bugcrowd to launch a bug bounty program, which offers a reward to security researchers who can find previously unknown vulnerabilities in the bank&#x27;s system. Would be participants must have an &quot;Elite Trust Score&quot; on Bugcrowd.

===Corporate responsibility===
In 2008, NAB invested $33.5 million in corporate responsibility initiatives. Its target is to spend 1% of cash earnings before tax in this area. In 2009, NAB became the largest Fairtrade accredited workplace in Australia through purchasing Fairtrade tea, coffee and hot chocolate for their offices and retail branches. In March 2010 NAB stated it expected to save nearly $1 million in annual power costs from a $6.5 million tri-generation plant at its main data centre. NAB became one of Australia&#x27;s largest carbon neutral companies in September 2010. NAB ranked equal first among financial service companies in the Global 500 companies in the 2010 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index.

===Sponsorship and scholarships===
In 2013 NAB emerged as a sponsor of Australian rules football, both at grassroots and elite level. It supports Auskick, an initiative to improve young footballers, as well as the NAB Cup (an Australian Football League pre-season competition), the NAB AFL Rising Star award; and the AFL National Draft. Other significant sporting sponsorships included the Socceroos, the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and was the main shirt sponsor of the South Sydney Rabbitohs between 2008 and 2010.

Support is also given towards community group volunteers around Australia. In recent years, NAB has provided financial support and relief to drought affected farmers and helped in the clean-up of flood affected in Queensland and Victoria. NAB has also sponsored the Sheikh Fehmi El-Imam Scholarship, designed to help strengthen the links between NAB and the Muslim community and enables an undergraduate student to continue post-graduate studies in finance and economics.

The National Australia Bank is the AFL Women&#x27;s current and inaugural naming rights partner.

==Controversies==

===Foreign currency trader staff fraud===
In 2004, NAB discovered that as a result of unauthorised spot trades on its foreign currency options desk, losses totalling A$360 million had been covered up. Investigations by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority highlighted a need for cultural change. The losses were a result of a failed speculative position where the traders falsified profits to trigger bonuses over a number of years. In order to actually generate the reported profits, the traders speculated on the US dollar, betting that it would rise against the Australian dollar and other currencies.
In 2006, two former NAB foreign currency options traders were sentenced on charges brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and incurred jail terms.

===Financial planner misconduct===
Acting on a customer complaint, an Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission (ASIC) investigation found that between 1997 and 2001, a NAB financial products seller, Paul Drakos, working out of a northern Sydney branch at Hornsby made recommendations to a number of NAB clients, mostly retirees, to invest in BSI Corp, an entity based in the Bahamas which was not a NAB approved investment product. According to ASIC, at least $6.2m was subsequently transferred from the overseas accounts in the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic back to a private company account, held for Strategic Investments Group ACN 080 924 036 and controlled by a single director, the same Paul Drakos. Funds were then applied from this account as loans disguised as investments to a number of failed business opportunities among his familial associates including a golf driving range on the Central Coast of NSW, a plumbing business, and futures and commodities trading. The land holdings, as inflated securities, were also used by the failed Allco Hit. The NAB employee was not officially connected with BSI but gave instructions to agents based in Canada to arrange for the transfer of funds back to Strategic Investments Group and other accounts. On 29 May 2006 the NAB employee pleaded guilty to 8 counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception, 2 counts of fraudulent misappropriation and 3 counts of making and using false documents. There is also a connection, not yet pursued by ASIC, to the collapse of the Allco HIT Ltd and Strategic Finances where it is suspected that the swampland was used to underpin financial dealings. During the time of the investigations the NAB provided the perpetrator of the fraud with a loan of $350,000 secured by swampland on the Central Coast of NSW.

===Ex-Chief of Staff and accomplice defraud NAB===
More than $5.5 million in inflated invoices from an event and function company Human Group were paid between 2014 and 2017 to Rosemary Rogers an NAB employee for more than twenty years, nine of which was as chief of staff to CEOs Cameron Clyne and Andrew Thorburn. The money was paid by a co-accused Helen Rosamond &quot;as an inducement or reward to ensure that Human Group maintained a contract with NAB&quot; according to court documents. The court was told by the prosecution Rogers was motivated by &quot;greed, personal gain and self-gratification&quot;. In sentencing, Judge Paul Conlon said the benefits she received went &quot;well beyond compensating family for any perceived neglect&quot;, and went onto say, &quot;I find it absolutely staggering that this fraud were not detected by some appropriate system of internal auditing by NAB&quot;. An anonymous whistle-blower sent a letter to NAB executives in 2017, alleging &quot;Rose&quot; had been receiving money and gifts over a number of years from Ms Rosamond. In sentencing, Rogers is to serve at least four years and nine months of her sentence being eligible for parole in October, 2025. Her co-accused is yet to be sentenced.

===Tax evasion and customer overcharging in Ireland===
The Irish subsidiary of the bank, National Irish Bank was the subject of a six-year Inquiry carried out by Inspectors appointed by the Irish High Court. They established that National Irish Bank had engaged in overcharging its own customers and tax evasion schemes prior to 1998. Mr Justice Peter Kelly, an Irish High Court judge commented following publication of the Report &quot;The edifice of banking is built on a foundation of trust. On the Inspectors findings there was a breach of trust. The operation was carried out over a period of years in a deliberate fashion&quot;. The Director of Corporate Enforcement subsequently applied to the High Court to have 9 senior managers barred from being an officer of any company.

===HomeSide write-downs===
NAB booked two write-downs associated with HomeSide. First, in July 2001, NAB had a $450 million write down of the value of its capitalised mortgage servicing rights (CMSRs) during the quarter ending 30 June 2001, and was the result of exceptionally high mortgage refinance volumes which lowered the value of the CMSRs, combined with a more challenging capital markets environment in which to hedge interest rate risk. This was followed shortly by a second write-down reported in September totalling $1.75 billion; this second write-down consisted of US$400 million from an incorrect interest rate assumption embedded in the mortgage servicing rights valuation model, US$760 million from changed assumptions in the model flowing from the continued unprecedented uncertainty and turbulence in the mortgage servicing market, and US$590 million from writing off of the goodwill. In total, NAB booked $2.2 billion in losses due to HomeSide.

As a result of all these events, NAB&#x27;s Australian shareholders attempted to sue it in the United States for securities fraud, even though the plaintiffs, the defendant, and the actual securities at issue (NAB&#x27;s shares) were all located in Australia. (The main advantage of suing in the U.S. arises from &quot;Basic Inc. v. Levinson&quot; (1988), under which it is presumed that the defendant committed &quot;fraud-on-the-market&quot; unless the defendant proves otherwise.) The case of &quot;Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd&quot; ultimately ended up before the U.S. Supreme Court, which held in a unanimous 8–0 decision on 24 June 2010 that U.S. law against securities fraud does not apply to securities deals occurring outside of the country.
===Financing of fossil fuel operations===

On 5 Nov 2015, NAB publicly supported the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. In the four years following this commitment, from 2016 to 2019, NAB loaned A$7.3 billion to the fossil fuel industry. Despite evidence that there can be little or no development of new or expansionary fossil fuel projects if the Paris Agreement climate goals are to be met, NAB loaned A$1.2 billion to such projects during 2016–2019. Over the same timeframe, NAB loaned A$1.1 billion to ten companies that were expanding the scale of the fossil fuel sector and/or relying on scenarios consistent with the failure of the Paris Agreement to justify their future business prospects.

Despite publicly committing to “no longer finance new thermal coal mining projects” in December 2017, the bank reportedly funded New Hope Group for its development of the New Acland Stage 3 Coal Mine, and Coronado Global Resources in connection with an expansion of its Curragh coal mine. Environmental groups have questioned whether NAB breached its thermal coal commitment by providing this funding.

In November 2019, NAB announced it would exit the thermal coal sector by 2035, attracting criticism on the basis that this is five years too late to be considered compatible with the Paris Agreement climate goals.

The Australian investor community has had various responses to continued financing of fossil fuel projects by NAB and the other members of the Big Four banks. These responses include:
* NAB customers moving their money to banks with a lesser financed emissions portfolio. 
* NAB shareholders asking for greater emissions disclosure and reduced finance for fossil fuels, including by lodging and supporting shareholder resolutions.
* Protest groups covering ATM screens to raise awareness of financed projects’ associated climate impacts and degradation of 
* The creation of &#x27;fossil fuel-free&#x27; superannuation and investment products which exclude NAB from the investment universe.

===Hayne Royal Commission===
A royal commission was established on in December 2017 to inquire into and report on misconduct in the banking, superannuation, and financial services industry. The establishment of the commission followed revelations in the media of a culture of greed within several Australian financial institutions. A subsequent parliamentary inquiry recommended a royal commission, noting the lack of regulatory intervention by the relevant government authorities, and later revelations that financial institutions were involved in money laundering for drug syndicates, turned a blind eye to terrorism financing, and ignored statutory reporting responsibilities and impropriety in foreign exchange trading.

During the Royal Commission, it was revealed that NAB subsidiary, MLC Limited, had charged some of its customers &quot;adviser contribution fees&quot; and &quot;employer service fees&quot; on its superannuation products. By its own admission, NAB executives told the Royal Commission that the customers might have not received any service, in spite of being charged a fee. NAB tried to disguise these fees as commissions. The following month ASIC commenced civil proceedings in the Federal Court alleging that NAB-owned superannuation entities had deducted $100 million in fees from more than 300,000 customers where services were not provided. Appearing before the Royal Commission in November 2018, NAB Chief Executive Officer Andrew Thorburn defended the fees-for-no-service issue as a &quot;process issue&quot; rather than dishonesty. Days earlier, NAB Chairman and former Secretary of The Treasury Ken Henry defensively appeared before the Royal Commission, with some tense exchanges between Henry and legal counsel Rowena Orr.

<text>Richard Wilhelm Heinrich Abegg (9 January 1869 – 3 April 1910) was a German chemist and pioneer of valence theory. He proposed that the difference of the maximum positive and negative valence of an element tends to be eight. This has come to be known as Abegg&#x27;s rule. He was a gas balloon enthusiast, which caused his death at the age of 41 when he crashed in his balloon in Silesia.

Abegg received his PhD on 19 July 1891 as the student of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the University of Berlin. Abegg learned organic chemistry from Hofmann, but one year after finishing his PhD degree he began researching physical chemistry while studying with Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig, Germany. Abegg later served as private assistant to Walther Nernst at the University of Göttingen and to Svante Arrhenius at the University of Stockholm.

Abegg discovered the theory of freezing-point depression and anticipated Gilbert Newton Lewis&#x27;s octet rule by revealing that the lowest and highest oxidation states of elements often differ by eight. He researched many topics in physical chemistry, including freezing points, the dielectric constant of ice, osmotic pressures, oxidation potentials, and complex ions.

==Personal life and education==
Richard Abegg was the son of Wilhelm Abegg and Margarete Friedenthal. He had a brother, Wilhelm Abegg, who became the Prussian Secretary of State. After attending Wilhelm High School in Berlin, Abegg studied organic chemistry at the University of Kiel and the University of Tübingen. He then attended the University of Berlin, from which he received his doctorate as the student of August Wilhelm von Hofmann. In 1895, he married Line Simon, who was also a ballooning enthusiast.

Abegg occupied himself with photography and balloon excursions. He was the initiator and chairman of the Silesian Club for Aeronautics in Breslau. Furthermore, he had an assessor&#x27;s function with the presidency of the German Air Sailors&#x27; Association. On 3 April 1910, Abegg flew from Breslau to Köslin in a balloon; at the end of the flight, the balloon&#x27;s basket caught in some bushes during the landing, resulting in Abegg being thrown out and striking his head. He died from a fractured skull in the early morning of 4 April.

==Work==
During school, Abegg fulfilled his duties in the military. In 1891, he became an officer of the German Reserves. In 1900, he became an Oberleutnant in the Reserves in the 9th Regiment of Hussars. During this year, he made his first flight in a balloon, for military purposes. Balloon flights became a frequent pastime of both Abegg and his wife. He made many scientific observations during his subsequent flights, which were never published.

In 1894, Abegg worked as an assistant to Walther Nernst, one of the founders of physical chemistry and, at the time, Professor of Physical Chemistry. In 1897, he took a position as a professor of chemistry at the University of Breslau. Two years later, Abegg was promoted to a Privatdozent (chemistry chair). A year later he became a professor. Clara Immerwahr, the first wife of Fritz Haber, studied and graduated as his student. In 1909 he became a full professor. Together with his colleague Guido Bodländer, he published on electro-affinity, then a new principle of inorganic chemistry.

Abegg is known best for his research recognizing the role that valence had with respect to chemical interactions. He found that some elements were less likely to combine into molecules, and from this concluded that the more stable elements had what are now called full electron shells. He was able to explain the attraction of atoms through opposite electrical charges. He also made the distinction between normal valence and contravalence. He found that the sum of these two valences always comes to eight, a rule that is now known as Abegg&#x27;s rule.

Abegg was the editor of &quot;Zeitschrift für Elektrochemie&quot; from 1901 until his death.

<doc id="550805" wikidata="Q3634931" url="?curid=550805" title="Bardot (Australian band)">
<text>Bardot was an Australian pop girl group which formed in 1999, consisting of Belinda Chapple, Sophie Monk, Sally Polihronas, Katie Underwood and Tiffani Wood. The group formed on the Australian reality television series &quot;Popstars&quot;, which attracted high ratings and significant media exposure. This resulted in the instant success of Bardot&#x27;s debut single &quot;Poison&quot; and debut album &quot;Bardot&quot; (2000), both which entered the Australian and New Zealand charts at number 1.

Following the departure of Underwood, Bardot released their second album &quot;Play It Like That&quot; (2001), featuring the top five Australian singles &quot;ASAP&quot; and &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;, before parting ways in early 2002. In 2021, the compilation &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released to mark the group&#x27;s 20 year anniversary.

==History==
===1999–2000: &quot;Popstars&quot; and debut album success===
Bardot formed on the Seven Network&#x27;s first series of &quot;Popstars&quot;, a talent reality television show which sought to produce a five-piece girl group. The Australian series was only second to the New Zealand version which produced the group True Bliss. The act would be sponsored by the Austereo radio network, &quot;New Idea&quot; magazine and signed to Warner Music. In 1999, over 2,500 hopefuls turned up to auditions around the country, judged by radio presenter Jackie O, music executive Chris Moss, and Grant Thomas Management manager Michael Napthali, who would manage the group&#x27;s career. 

After numerous elimination rounds, Chantelle Barry, Belinda Chapple, Sophie Monk, Sally Polihronas and Katie Underwood were selected. Shortly after the group&#x27;s formation, controversy occurred when Barry departed the group with no explanation. During interviews years later, Barry clarified that she was forced to leave after taking Monk&#x27;s weekly $100 money allowance, and forgetting to give it back to her. Polihronas would later state she felt Barry was &quot;exploited&quot; by the show and made out to be &quot;the villain&quot;. Following her departure, judges selected Newcastle singer Tiffani Wood as the fifth member and the name &quot;Bardot&quot; was chosen in tribute of French actress Brigitte Bardot. &quot;Popstars&quot; began airing in February 2000 and followed Bardot during its recording sessions, photo and music video shoots, promotional activities and first live concert at the Sydney State Theatre. Considered a unique and fresh format at the time, it attracted on average more than 2.6 million viewers per episode, making it one of Australia&#x27;s most successful, highest-rating programs of 2000. The series was nominated for &quot;Most Popular Reality Program&quot; at the 2001 Logie Awards. The success of &quot;Popstars&quot; led to widespread national media coverage and the group&#x27;s instore signings attracted thousands of fans, translating into instant record sales success. 

Bardot&#x27;s debut single &quot;Poison&quot; entered the Australian singles chart at number 1, selling over 60,000 copies in its first week. It gained double platinum status, remaining in the top spot for two consecutive weeks. Their self-titled debut album also entered the charts at number 1, with Bardot setting a record by becoming the first Australian act to debut at number 1 with both its debut single and debut album. The album would go on to sell over double platinum copies and was the 20th highest selling album in Australia for 2000. Bardot repeated the same results with its debut single and album in New Zealand, where &quot;Poison&quot; spent three consecutive weeks at number 1.

Second single &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Never Let You Go&quot; peaked at number 14 in Australia. During this time, Bardot made a promotional trip to Singapore and other parts of south-east Asia, where the group had attracted a large fanbase. The album reached number 2 in Singapore while &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Never Let You Go&quot; reached number 1. In August 2000, Bardot embarked on its first national concert tour of Australia and released their third single &quot;These Days&quot;, which peaked at number 19 in Australia. The group performed &quot;These Days&quot; at the 2000 ARIA Music Awards where they were nominated for Highest Selling Single, Highest Selling Album and Best Video.

===2001–2002: Departure of Underwood and &quot;Play It Like That&quot;===
In March 2001, Bardot relocated to the United Kingdom to release &quot;Poison&quot; and begin work on their second album. Despite a significant promotional push including appearances on SMTV Live, Nickelodeon and Pepsi Chart, the single was only a limited success, peaking at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. While preparing the release of &quot;ASAP&quot;, the first single from their second album, Underwood decided to leave Bardot in pursuit of a role in the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. Ultimately the production was cancelled before it commenced due to financial pressures and shortly after, Underwood would go on to collaborate with dance act Disco Montego. &quot;ASAP&quot; launched Bardot as a four-piece in July 2001 and reached number 5 in Australia, becoming their fourth gold single.

In August 2001, Bardot performed the Village People&#x27;s &quot;Go West&quot; at the opening ceremony of the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane and in October, released the second single from their second album, &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;. The single gained a positive reception from critics with comparisons to the dance-pop music of Kylie Minogue being made. It confirmed the group&#x27;s staying power, peaking in the Australian top 5 and becoming Bardot&#x27;s highest charting debut since &quot;Poison&quot;. In November 2001, Bardot released their second album, &quot;Play It Like That&quot;, which featured co-writes by all members and received favourable reviews from critics. The album debuted at number 16 on the Australian album charts and was certified gold, but continued to drop in the weeks following, spending seven weeks in the top 100. To support the album&#x27;s launch, Bardot performed at Austereo&#x27;s Rumba music festivals in Melbourne and Sydney, each attended by 40,000 spectators.

In February 2002, the group released its final single, &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;, which peaked at number 18. In March they embarked on their second national tour with Australian boy band Human Nature and performed at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. In April, Bardot performed at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in Malaysia, followed by a promotional tour of India.

===2002–2019: Break-up and post-Bardot years===
On 16 April 2002, Bardot announced its decision to split. An official statement read the group had &quot;...cited the need for a well earned break following what has been a phenomenal 2.5-year explosion on the Australian music scene&quot; and that &quot;the pace at which the group&#x27;s career continued...has taken its toll.&quot; The group performed a farewell concert for Channel V and made their final appearance together for a charity event on 2 May in Sydney. The decision to break up came as a surprise to many in the industry who believed Bardot was in the process of establishing a strong and credible reputation. Rumours circulated that the split was a result of Monk&#x27;s desire to begin a solo career, though she denied this. Soon after Bardot&#x27;s split, Wood confirmed that at the time, both she and Chapple were the two members keen to continue as Bardot. 

All members, apart from Polihronas, went on to release solo music before forging careers in different fields. Solo singles that charted in the Australian top 50 were Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Danger&quot; (2004) and collaboration singles &quot;Beautiful&quot; (2002), &quot;Magic&quot; (2002) and &quot;Be Together&quot; (2006), Monk&#x27;s &quot;Inside Outside&quot; (2002), &quot;Get the Music On&quot; (2003) and &quot;One Breath Away&quot; (2003), Wood&#x27;s &quot;What R U Waiting 4&quot; (2004), and Chappel&#x27;s &quot;Move Together&quot; (2005). Monk is the only member to have achieved a charting solo album with &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; (2003). In April 2004, Bardot&#x27;s original management team Grant Thomas Management sued the &quot;Popstars&quot; producer Screentime and its joint venture company Five Divas, for breach of contract and loss of earnings. In November 2000, Bardot sacked Grant Thomas Management midway through a three-year contract because according to Screentime, Bardot had &quot;lost all confidence&quot;. Grant Thomas were successfully awarded $129,561. In 2009, Wood and Underwood professionally reunited for the stage musical &quot;Valentino&quot;, based on the life of Rudolph Valentino. In 2019, after years of being commercially unavailable, both of Bardot&#x27;s albums were added to streaming services.

===2020–present: 20th anniversary celebrations, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and mini reunion===
In April 2020, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their debut single &quot;Poison&quot;, Wood, Underwood and Chapple reunited remotely online to perform the song. Barry would also release her own version of &quot;Poison&quot; later that year. A greatest hits album was released on vinyl in January 2021 and a further compilation containing remixes, b-sides and the previously unreleased track, &quot;Something Worth Fighting For&quot;, was released digitally in April 2021. In June 2021, both of Bardot&#x27;s studio albums were re-issued on vinyl for the first time and in July 2021, an EP of new remixes was released.

In October 2021, Underwood and Chapple professionally reunited as a duo under the name Ka&#x27;Bel, releasing their debut single &quot;Broken Hearted&quot;. In 2023 Chapple published a memoir outlining her time in Bardot called &quot;The Girl in the Band&quot;.

<doc id="550817" wikidata="Q3874051" url="?curid=550817" title="Naïve (album)">
<text>Naïve is the fourth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on November 15, 1990, by Wax Trax! Records. It was recorded following KMFDM&#x27;s return from their first visit to the United States and subsequent tour with Ministry. It was also the first record they released after signing directly to Wax Trax! Records.

==Background==
The album was out of print for over a decade due to copyright infringement: the seventh track &quot;Liebeslied&quot; used unauthorized samples from a recording of &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, from Carl Orff&#x27;s 1930s cantata &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. The album was recalled approximately three years after being released. Physical copies are rare and considered collector&#x27;s items. In addition to this, &quot;Godlike&quot; samples &quot;Angel of Death&quot; by Slayer.

All of the tracks on the album, except for the original mixes of &quot;Die Now-Live Later&quot;, &quot;Liebeslied&quot; and &quot;Go to Hell&quot; were subsequently available on other discs. The album was re-released as &quot;Naïve/Hell to Go&quot;, with some songs remixed, in 1994. A digitally remastered reissue of &quot;Naïve&quot; was released on 21 November 2006, along with &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Angst&quot;. It was reissued with an edited version of the track &quot;Liebeslied&quot; without the offending sample. It also features the remixes that initially appeared on &quot;Naïve/Hell to Go&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Naïve&quot; received excellent reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Naïve&quot; &quot;one of [KMFDM&#x27;s] strongest releases.&quot; Ned Raggett of Allmusic began his review by saying, &quot;KMFDM brought it all together on the brilliant Naïve&quot;, doing &quot;everything from four-to-the-floor beats to Wagnerian epic metal and back again&quot;. He went on to call it &quot;one of industrial/electronic body music&#x27;s key albums&quot;, and said that KMFDM was a band &quot;so ridiculously good that everything they touch pretty much turns to gold&quot;. He also said that while the title track was &quot;fantastic&quot;, the &quot;total standout&quot; of the album was &quot;Liebeslied&quot;: &quot;Outrageously interpolating Carl Orff&#x27;s noted vocal piece Carmina Burana into a bombastic explosion of mechanical rhythms, orchestral hits, and an increasing amount of hero guitar feedback slabs, not to mention the husked, desperate lead vocals, it&#x27;s a jawdropping masterpiece that demands and gets total surrender.&quot; In 2019, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Naïve&quot; at number ten on its list of the thirty-three best industrial albums of all time, with writer Susan Elizabeth Shepard noting that the album combined &quot;hip-hop beats and metal riffs into deep, big-beat anthems&quot;.

Naïve/Hell to Go is a modified and remixed version of &quot;Naïve&quot;, with five of the original songs re-recorded, including &quot;Liebeslied&quot;, which contained an unlicensed sample of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from Carl Orff&#x27;s cantata &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. After Orff&#x27;s publisher threatened the band with legal action, the original album was recalled.

<text>The Sudanese Air Force () is the aerial warfare branch of the Sudanese Armed Forces. It was established in 1956 following Sudan&#x27;s independence earlier that year, and first saw action in the First Sudanese Civil War.

==History==
The Sudanese Air Force was founded immediately after Sudan gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. The British assisted in the Air Force&#x27;s establishment, providing equipment and training. Four new Hunting Provost T Mk 51s were delivered for jet training in 1961. In 1958, the Sudanese Air Force&#x27;s transport wing acquired its first aircraft, a single Hunting President. In 1960 the Sudanese Air Force received an additional four re-furbished RAF Provosts and two more Hunting Presidents. Also in 1960, the transport wing&#x27;s capability was increased by the addition of two Pembroke C Mk 54s.

The SAF gained its first combat aircraft when 12 Jet Provosts with a close air support capability were delivered in 1962. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union and China started supplying the Sudanese Air Force with aircraft. This included supply of Shenyang F-5 fighters (F-5/FT-5 variants).

== Air bases ==

* Kenana Air Base
* Wadi Seidna Air Base
* Port Sudan Air Base

==Equipment==
===Aircraft===
The air force flies a mixture of transport planes, fighter jets and helicopters which are mainly sourced from the Soviet Union/Russia and China. However, not all the aircraft are in a fully functioning state and the availability of spare parts has been limited. In 1991, the two main air bases were at the capital Khartoum and Wadi Sayyidna near Omdurman.

On 4 April 2001, a Sudanese Antonov An-24 aircraft crashed in Adaril (Adar Yeil, Adar Yale), Sudan. The fifteen dead included a general, seven lieutenant generals, three brigadiers, a colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a corporal.

In 2009, Sudan made a successful deal to buy two different batches of 12 MiG-29 Russian fighter jets each. There were 23 MiG-29s in active service as of late 2008. However, the rebel Justice and Equality Movement claimed to have shot down one MiG-29 with large-caliber machine-gun fire on 10 May 2008, killing the pilot of the plane, a retired Russian Air Force fighter pilot; the Sudanese government denied the allegation. South Sudan also claimed to have shot down a Sudanese MiG-29 during the 2012 border conflict.

In mid-2011, members of the UN Panel of Experts on the Sudan documented the following aircraft in Darfur which potentially indicated violations of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556:

*Letter dated 24 January 2011 from former members of the Panel of Experts on the Sudan established pursuant to Resolution 1591 (2005) and renewed pursuant to Resolution 1945 (2010) addressed to the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to Resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan, page 30
**Five Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft (tail numbers 201, 204, 205, 207, 212)
**Three Mi-17 transport helicopters (tail numbers 525, 540, 543)
**Nine Mi-24 attack helicopters (tail numbers 928, 937, 938, 939, 942, 943, 947, 948 stationed at El Fasher and Nyala, and an additional Mi-24 which crashed near El Fasher on 18 April 2011.) Satellite imagery also indicates that a total of five other attack helicopters were present at Kutum, N Darfur, in April 2011, and at El Geneima in February 2011, but panel members have not determined whether they were introduced from outside Darfur in addition to those listed above, or moved from within Darfur.

In August 2013, pictures showed Su-24&#x27;s in Sudanese colors, reporting that the aircraft were among the ex Belarusian Air Force Su-24&#x27;s retired in 2012. Various reports have said that the air force uses Iranian drones such as the Ghods Ababil.


==== Retired ==== 
Previous notable aircraft operated were the BAC Jet Provost T55, Douglas C-47,Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II, BAC 167 Strikemaster Mk.90, Shaanxi Y-8, Antonov An-2, Fokker F27 Friendship, Pilatus PC-6 Porter, Shenyang J-2, MBB Bo 105CB, Mil Mi-4, and the Agusta-Bell 212 helicopter.

<doc id="550823" wikidata="Q4056088" url="?curid=550823" title="Australian Prudential Regulation Authority">
<text>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is a statutory authority of the Australian Government and the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry. APRA was established on 1 July 1998 in response to the recommendations of the Wallis Inquiry. APRA&#x27;s authority and scope is determined pursuant to the .

==Regulatory scope==
APRA was established on 1 July 1998. It oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, friendly societies, general insurance, health insurance, reinsurance, and life insurance companies, and most members of the superannuation industry. It ensures that these institutions keep their financial promises; that is, that they will remain financially sound and able to meet their obligations to depositors, fund members and policy holders. APRA currently supervises institutions holding A$8.6 trillion in assets for Australian depositors, policyholders and superannuation fund members. APRA is largely funded by levies on the financial institutions that it supervises.

==Executive==
APRA is governed by an Executive Group, usually consisting of four people. All are statutory appointees. The current chair of APRA is John Lonsdale. Helen Rowell and Margaret Cole are Deputy Chairs. Suzanne Smith and Therese McCarthy Hockey are additional APRA Members.

==History==
The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) was formally established on 23 November 1987, following the proclamation of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. It was constructed from the Superannuation Division of Treasury, The Office of the General Insurance Commissioner, The Office of Life Insurance Commissioner, and The Office of the Australian Government Actuary. The commission was based at the Australian Automobile Association Building, Canberra and also had offices in Melbourne and Sydney. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission was absorbed into the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on 1 July 1998.

In June 1996, the Financial System Inquiry (known as the Wallis Inquiry) was established to examine the results of the deregulation of the Australian financial system, to examine the forces driving further change, particularly technological, and recommend changes to the regulatory system to ensure an &quot;efficient, responsive, competitive and flexible financial system to underpin stronger economic performance, consistent with financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness.&quot;

At the time, the regulators of the Australian financial services industry were based on the institutions and not the regulatory function. APRA&#x27;s predecessor regulators were the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC). The Wallis Inquiry recommended a new structure.

The role of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was amended to deal with monetary policy and systemic stability with the Payments System Board considering payments systems regulation. The role of the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission (later to become APRA) was amended to deal with prudential regulation of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), life and general insurance, and superannuation including Industry superannuation. The Corporations and Financial Services Commission was renamed and its role expanded as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to deal with market integrity, consumer protection and corporations.

APRA was established on 1 July 1998 under the &quot;Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998&quot;.

APRA became prominent in the collapse of HIH Insurance in 2001 and for its investigation into the National Australia Bank foreign currency deal scandal in 2004.

APRA took over the previous role of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council in July 2015.

In 2018, Peter Harris, the chair of the Productivity Commission, was critical of the role of APRA in limiting price competition in banking. Representatives of APRA appeared before the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry during 2018.

In 2018, APRA created the restricted authorised deposit-taking institution (RADI) licensing framework to encourage new entrants and competition to the existing banking system.

== Prudential Standards and Practice Guides ==
APRA establishes prudential standards with which regulated institutions must comply. It also creates and maintains &quot;Prudential Practice Guides&quot; (PPGs) to provide guidance on APRA&#x27;s view of &quot;sound practice&quot; in particular areas for specific industries, as well as areas common to most APRA-regulated entities (&quot;cross-industry guides&quot;). PPGs frequently discuss statutory requirements from legislation, regulations or APRA&#x27;s prudential standards, but do not themselves create enforceable requirements.

<text>Günter Schulz (or Guenter Schulz) is a German musician, songwriter and former member of the industrial band KMFDM.

==Biography==
Schulz&#x27;s first credited appearance (as Svetlana Ambrosius, or Svet Am) was on the band KMFDM&#x27;s album &quot;Naïve&quot; in 1990, although already having appeared on the &quot;Godlike&quot; single which was released 3 months prior (albeit uncredited). He continued using that stage name until 1995&#x27;s &quot;Nihil&quot;. Schulz displayed an impressive mastery of speed metal guitar skills and co-wrote many of KMFDM&#x27;s songs in the 1990s. He also wrote and performed in various KMFDM side projects, including two albums with Sascha Konietzko&#x27;s Excessive Force and a solo album by En Esch. He currently resides in Vancouver, Canada.

In early manifestations of the KMFDM website, Schulz maintained a section called &quot;Günter&#x27;s Guitar Garage.&quot; Among other things, he used the space to encourage amateur guitarists to learn formal notation as opposed to tablature.

After KMFDM disbanded in 1999, Schulz and Esch recorded a few songs for tribute albums and then formed Slick Idiot, a band featuring Schulz&#x27;s trademark guitar and Esch&#x27;s vocal stylings. The band has, as of 2010, released three studio albums and two remix albums. KMFDM reformed in 2001, though Schulz and Esch rejected Konietzko&#x27;s offer to return to the fold.

Schulz is interested in photography and took many of the band portraits that appear in KMFDM and Slick Idiot liner notes. Concert attendees also observed Schulz taking pictures of the crowd during KMFDM&#x27;s &quot;Symbols&quot; tour (1997). These photos became the material for the video &quot;In Your Face&quot;.

Guenter also travelled to Ghana as part of the crew for &quot;So Good, So Far: the Way Forward&quot;. He took photographs for the film and documented the trip through his photographic prowess.

In 2005, Schulz announced the formation of a self-titled solo project, &quot;Schulz&quot;. He was part of PIG&#x27;s touring line-up in the summer of 2006, thus reuniting with fellow KMFDM alumni Raymond Watts.

In 2016, Schulz toured with Raymond Nainz Watts (a.k.a. PIG) in support of the album &quot;The Gospel&quot;.

<text>Football Australia is the governing body of soccer, futsal, and beach soccer within Australia, headquartered in Sydney. Although the first governing body of the sport was founded in 1911, Football Australia in its current form was only established in 1961 as the Australian Soccer Federation. It was later reconstituted in 2003 as the Australian Soccer Association before adopting the name of Football Federation Australia in 2005. In contemporary identification, a corporate decision was undertaken to institute that name to deliver a &quot;more united football&quot; in a deliberation from the current CEO, James Johnson. The name was changed to Football Australia in December 2020.

Football Australia oversees the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, youth, Paralympic, beach and futsal national teams in Australia, the national coaching programs and the state governing bodies for the sport. It sanctions professional, semi-professional and amateur soccer in Australia. Football Australia made the decision to leave the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), for which it was a founding member, and become a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 2006 and ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) in 2013.

==History==
Football Australia&#x27;s origins lie as far back as 1911, with the formation of the &quot;Commonwealth Football Association&quot;. This body was then superseded by the Australian Soccer Football Association, which was formed in 1921, with its headquarters in Sydney. The Australian Soccer Football Association operated for forty years, was given FIFA provisional membership in November 1954 and this was confirmed in June 1956, however in 1960, the association disbanded after being suspended from FIFA for the poaching of players from overseas. In 1961 the Australian Soccer Federation was formed as a potential successor to the former governing body for the sport. However, this association was refused re-admittance to FIFA until outstanding fines had been paid, which was later done in 1963, seeing the new national body admitted to FIFA.

Isolated from international football, Australia repeatedly applied to join the Asian Football Confederation in 1960, and in 1974 but were denied in all requests. Australia with New Zealand eventually formed the Oceania Football Federation (now Oceania Football Confederation) in 1966. Australia resigned as an OFC member in 1972 to pursue membership with the AFC, but they rejoined in 1978.

In 1995, the Australian Soccer Federation formally changed its name to Soccer Australia.

In 2003, following Australia&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, allegations of fraud and mismanagement were levelled at Soccer Australia by elements within the Australian Press including the ABC. Soccer Australia commissioned an independent inquiry known as the Crawford Report as a result of the Australian Government&#x27;s threat to withdraw funding to the sport. The Australian Government could not interfere as any political interference would have constituted a breach of FIFA Statutes. The findings of the report were critically analysed by the board of Soccer Australia who believed that the recommendations contained therein were not capable of being implemented. The report recommended, among other things, the reconstitution of the governing body with an interim board headed by prominent businessman Frank Lowy. Some three months after Lowy&#x27;s appointment Soccer Australia was placed into liquidation and Australia Soccer Association (ASA) was created without encompassing the Crawford Report recommendations and effectively disenfranchising all parties who had an interest in Soccer Australia. The Australian Government provided approximately $15 million to the ASA.

On 1 January 2005, ASA renamed itself to Football Federation Australia (FFA), aligning with the general international usage of the word &quot;football&quot;, in preference to &quot;soccer&quot;, and to also distance itself from the failings of the old Soccer Australia. It coined the phrase &quot;old soccer, new football&quot; to emphasise this.

On 1 January 2006, Football Federation Australia moved from the OFC to the AFC. The move was unanimously endorsed by the AFC Executive Committee on 23 March 2005, and assented by the OFC on 17 April. The FIFA Executive Committee approved the move on 29 June, noting that &quot;as all of the parties involved ... had agreed to the move, the case did not need to be discussed by the FIFA Congress&quot;, and was unanimously ratified by the AFC on 10 September. Football Australia hoped that the move would give Australia a fairer chance of qualifying for the FIFA World Cup and allow A-League clubs to compete in the AFC Champions League, thereby improving the standard of Australian football at both international and club levels with improved competition in the region.

In February 2008, the Football Federation Australia formally announced their intention to bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. In 2010, the decision was made by Football Australia to withdraw its World Cup bid for 2018, instead focusing on a bid for the 2022 tournament. FFA failed in its $45.6 million bid for the 2022 World Cup having received only one vote from the FIFA Executive.

On 27 August 2013, Australia was admitted as a full member to the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF), after they formally joined as an invite affiliation to the regional body in 2006. However, its men&#x27;s national team has not played the ASEAN Championship as part of the initial agreement.

On 29 January 2015, after the defeat of Iraq and the United Arab Emirates during the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, West Asian Football Federation members reportedly sought to remove Australia from the AFC primarily due to &quot;Australia benefiting hugely from Asian involvement without giving much in return&quot;.

In November 2018 with numerous board positions coming to the end of their 3-year term, the bulk of the board of directors were replaced at an annual general meeting, as well as the departure of Steven Lowy as chair of the board, which he did in protest at major changes to the governance and voting structure in the overarching Football Australia Congress that elects the Board. His position was filled by Chris Nikou. Other board members to be elected were Heather Reid, Joseph Carrozzi and Remo Nogarotto.

On 25 June 2020, Australia won the rights to co-host the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup alongside New Zealand.

On 25 November 2020, the FFA Annual General Meeting (AGM) was held. The FFA voted to rename itself to Football Australia. Football Australia Chief Executive, James Johnson, told the media the rebranding would not cost the organisation any money as they already owned the domain and company names. The name change was seen as a way to unify the branding with the state member federations.

On 31 December 2020, it was announced that the A-League, W-League and Y-League would no longer be under the jurisdiction of Football Australia in an &#x27;unbundling&#x27; process. The newly formed Australian Professional Leagues would take over the running of top-level football. As part of the unbundling, the Australian Professional Leagues would also obtain the exclusive right to use the intellectual property rights associated with the A-League brand. These competitions are now known as the A-League Men, A-League Women and A-League Youth.

==Administration==
Soccer in Australia has used a federated model of national, states and territories governing bodies since the first state body was established in New South Wales in 1882. Local associations and regional zones were set up within the states and territories as soccer expanded and from time to time informal groups of clubs have augmented the formal structures. Today, there is one national governing body, nine state and territory member federations and over 100 district, regional and local zones and associations.

==National Indigenous Advisory Group==

In November 2021, Football Australia created the inaugural National Indigenous Advisory Group (NIAG), an advisory body aimed at helping to foster engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and increase their participation in the game. NIAG is an advisory body for Football Australia, comprising 9 members of First Nations communities.

The inaugural members of the group are drawn from all levels of football as well as media, academia, and government: Frank Farina OAM, Karen Menzies (the first Indigenous Matilda), Tanya Oxtoby, Kyah Simon, Jade North (former Socceroos defender), Courtney Hagan, Kenny Bedford, Selina Holtze, Professor John Maynard, Narelda Jacobs, and Football Australia&#x27;s Head of Women&#x27;s Football, Sarah Walsh. North and Walsh are co-chairs of the group.

The initial focus of NIAG is on supporting and retaining First Nations players and other staff involved in the game, reviewing pathways and programs to football that impact social outcomes, fostering strategic partnerships, as well as developing employment strategies and the organisation&#x27;s reconciliation action plan (RAP).

==Competitions==
Football Australia organises several national competitions, with state-based competitions organised by the respective state governing soccer bodies.

* A-League Men (ceased ownership of the competition in July 2019)

<doc id="550868" wikidata="Q3876808" url="?curid=550868" title="Nightveil">
<text>Nightveil is a fictional character, a superheroine who appears in the &quot;Femforce&quot; comic book, published by AC Comics. An adaptation of the Golden Age superhero Phantom Lady, she has also been known as Blue Bulleteer and Nightfall. Her secret identity is Laura Wright, daughter of a member of the United States Senate.

== Publication history ==
Nightveil (in her Blue Bulleteer identity) is an adaptation of the Golden Age superhero Phantom Lady. AC believed that the copyrights to the original character and stories had lapsed and were now in the public domain, but DC Comics asserted that it owned the rights to the character. AC declined to challenge the larger publisher.

In her first appearance, &quot;Captain Paragon&quot; #1 (1972), she was named The Phantom Lady. In &quot;Bill Black&#x27;s Fun Comics&quot; #4 (March 1983), she became Nightfall. She was renamed Nightveil in &quot;Nightveil&quot; #1 (1984). She first appeared as Blue Bulleteer in &quot;FemForce Special&quot; #1 (Fall 1984).

== Fictional character biography==
Laura Wright was born on December 4, 1920. She began her crimefighting career as the masked Blue Bulleteer, using a pair of firearms to battle evil. In the 1960s, Laura became the pupil of an otherworldly being Azagoth. He took her to another dimension called Limbo for sorcery training. Then, she later reappeared on Earth as Nightveil, with her youth restored and ready to fight crime again. Nightveil combats supernatural villains like the Black Shroud, Gorgana, and her nemesis Alizarin Crimson.

== Powers and abilities ==
Originally, Laura have no superpowers, but fought evil as the Blue Bulleteer, a costumed markswoman. After a near-fatal injury, she was rescued by the wizard Azagoth, who has given her genuine mystical powers (such as teleportation, flight, intangibility, and elemental control). Even as a witch, Nightveil still maintains her agility.

== Live appearances ==
In live appearances, Nightveil is played by Mary Capps.

Capps made appearances at conventions as Nightveil until 2007, her last appearance being at Visioncon in Springfield, Missouri. It was at this point that Visioncon declined to re-invite her because of lack of fan interest. She has said, however, that even if she had been invited, she would not have been able to make the trip from Texas.

=== Film ===
In 2005, AC Comics released the low-budget live-action movie &quot;Nightveil: Witch War&quot;. It starred Mary Capps in the title role. Her husband, Chuck Capps, played a jewel thief, with Maria Paris as Nightveil&#x27;s nemesis, Alizarin Crimson/Lenore Stratten.

Nightveil and the Sorcerers Eye - 2010 - Maria Paris as Nightveil - 49 minutes - Bill Black - director &amp; producer.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Valkeakoski is best known for its paper industry and domestically highly successful football team, FC Haka.

The town and the paper industry have both grown by the Valkeakoski rapids between the lake Mallasvesi in the north and the lake Vanajavesi in the south.

== History ==

The Valkeakoski area is known to have been inhabited since the Iron Age. More than a thousand years ago, the ridges on the area served as a foundation of the Rapola fort. In the following Middle Ages, the mill town Sääksmäki was the center of the area. However, industrialization towards the end of the 19th century increased the importance of what became the contemporary town of Valkeakoski. The channel of Valkeakoski was opened in 1869, and the first paper mill was completed in 1873, marking the beginning of a continuing tradition of the forest industry. The municipality of Sääksmäki, from which the town of Valkeakoski was detached in 1923 was consolidated with Valkeakoski in 1973.

==Districts, neighborhoods and villages==

===Countryside and villages===
The entire countryside of Valkeakoski consists mainly of the former Sääksmäki municipality areas.

<doc id="550908" wikidata="Q897750" url="?curid=550908" title="New X-Men (2004 series)">
<text>New X-Men is a superhero comic book series published by Marvel Comics within the X-Men franchise.

After the end of Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2 (titled &quot;New X-Men&quot;) the title was used for a new series, &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot; during the X-Men Reload event. The title was later shortened to simply &quot;New X-Men&quot; in 2006 when the new creative team of Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost took over the series with issue #20.

Whereas most other &quot;X-Men&quot; comics mostly deal with established adult mutants, this series concentrates on the lives of young students residing at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning as they learn to control their powers.

After the 2007 crossover &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex&quot;, the &quot;New X-Men&quot; title was canceled and briefly relaunched as &quot;Young X-Men&quot; for 12 issues. The series was written by Marc Guggenheim. After the first arc of &quot;Young X-Men&quot;, the characters began appearing in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. With the cancellation of &quot;Young X-Men&quot; the characters were folded onto the main X-Men books, appearing most prominently in the pages of &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;, &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, and most recently, in &quot;X-Men&quot;.

==Founding==
&quot;New X-Men&quot; begins where Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on the former &quot;New X-Men&quot; ended. The school is rebuilt and Emma Frost and Cyclops are named the headmasters. They organize the students into several battle squads who train together.

The series focuses chiefly on two rival teams: the New Mutants, whose mentor is Danielle Moonstar, and the Hellions, whose mentor is Emma Frost.

===New Mutants squad===
The New Mutants squad&#x27;s tutor is Danielle Moonstar. It is co-led by Wind Dancer and Prodigy.

* Elixir (Josh Foley) - Foley is an Omega-class healer who is a rabid mutant-hater until he finds out he is one himself. Following the events of &quot;M-Day&quot; and Reverend Stryker slaughtering many of his friends and his lover Wallflower, Elixir&#x27;s powers morph so that he can now kill as well as heal with a touch of his hand.
* Icarus (Joshua &quot;Jay&quot; Guthrie) - Guthrie is able to fly, sing hypnotically, and heal himself rapidly. Jay&#x27;s wings are amputated in issue #20 and he is killed in issue #26 by Reverend Stryker.

* Tag (Brian Cruz) - Cruz could psionically &quot;tag&quot; a person so that bystanders are compelled to run away from or toward that person. He is killed on the bus ambushed by the Purifiers along with several other depowered mutants.
* Wither (Kevin Ford) - Ford can destroy organic matter with a touch. He is romantic rivals with Elixir for Wallflower. When Wallflower dies, Wither flees the school and becomes Selene&#x27;s second-in-command. He is killed by Elixir during the final battle of the &quot;Necrosha&quot; storyline.

==&quot;Decimation&quot;==

In the aftermath of the &quot;Decimation&quot; event known as M-Day, the mutant student body in the academy dropped from 182 to 27. At least 45 depowered students were killed and, of the remaining students, Emma Frost picked a select group to train as New X-Men. These new X-Men were Dust, Elixir, Hellion, Mercury, Rockslide, Surge (appointed leader) and X-23. As time progressed, several members were added and/or earned the right to be on the team, such as Anole, Gentle, Pixie and Prodigy. The rest of the students were instructed to remain on school grounds, some providing assistance to the current X-Men teams and trainees. Some M-day survivors and depowered students either left the mansion or were killed off during villainous attacks by Stryker and his men, or various other enemies.

==&quot;Young X-Men&quot;==

The &quot;Young X-Men&quot; series launched as part of the &quot;X-Men&quot; storyline &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; in April, 2008. Written by Marc Guggenheim and pencilled by Yanick Paquette, it featured a line-up of Blindfold, Dust, Rockslide, Wolf Cub and three new characters: Graymalkin, Ink, and in the second issue, Cipher. The first arc involved the group being formed by Donald Pierce, who thanks to changes inflicted upon him by the Purifiers, impersonates Cyclops as part of an elaborate plot to kill the young mutants who he sees are the last generation of mutants born prior to M-Day. The group are manipulated into fighting members of the New Mutants before Pierce is ultimately exposed. In the end, per Blindfold&#x27;s prediction at the start of the series, Donald Pierce murders Wolf Cub before being captured by the group and taken into custody by the X-Men.

When the X-Men franchise is relaunched with the relocation of the X-Men to San Francisco following the events in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, the characters relocate to California. The series is ultimately canceled with issue #12 and many events of the series (such as Dust being mortally wounded during the team&#x27;s fight with the New Mutants) would be ignored by later writers.

==&quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;, &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;==

Most of the characters (most notably Pixie, who was granted full X-Men membership) appear sporadically following the events of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #500 and the cancellation of &quot;Young X-Men&quot;. Elixir and X-23 are incorporated into the roster of a new &quot;X-Force&quot; series. The characters are ultimately given a new home in the pages of &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;, written by Mike Carey starting with &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; #226. Now a loose collection of students, the kids are led by Rogue, who serves as the team&#x27;s teacher. Following the events of &quot;X-Men: Schism&quot;, many of the New X-Men members follow Wolverine back East as he reopens the Xavier Institute as a school and sanctuary for young mutants named the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. As of &quot;X-Men: Regenesis&quot;, several additional X-Men join Rogue and Wolverine in serving as teachers for the young mutants: Cannonball, Gambit, Rachel Grey, Husk and Shadowcat. The group has also accepted non-mutant members, such as Broo (a young Brood hatchling who is a pacifist) and Kid Gladiator, the son of X-Men enemy Gladiator. Another member of the student body is Kid Omega, whose involvement with the school is involuntary in an effort to reform him.

<text>Skylon was a series of concept designs for a reusable single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane by the British company Reaction Engines Limited, using SABRE, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system.

The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a specially built reinforced runway, and accelerate to Mach 5.4 at altitude (compared to typical airliner&#x27;s ) using the atmosphere&#x27;s oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to accelerate to the Mach 25 necessary to reach a 400 km orbit.

It would carry of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency&#x27;s Automated Transfer Vehicle; or to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).

The relatively light vehicle would re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic matrix composite skin. When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance, with a turnaround time of approximately two days, and be able to complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle.

In paper studies, the cost per kilogram (kg) of payload carried to LEO in this way is hoped to be reduced from the current £1,108/kg (), including research and development, to around £650/kg (718USD/kg), with costs expected to fall much more over time after initial expenditures have amortised. In 2004, the developer estimated the total lifetime cost of the Skylon C1 programme to be about $12 billion. , only a small portion of the funding required to develop and build Skylon had been secured. For the first couple of decades the work was privately funded, with public funding beginning in 2009 through a European Space Agency (ESA) contract. The British government pledged £60 million to the project on 16 July 2013 to allow a prototype of the SABRE engine to be built; contracts for this funding were signed in 2015.

Reaction Engines conducted tests of components of the SABRE engine in 2012 and 2024. Later in 2024, the company entered administration.

==Research and development programme==

===Background and early work===
Skylon has its origins within a previous space development programme for an envisioned single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) spaceplane, known as HOTOL. In 1982, when work commenced on the HOTOL by several British companies, there was significant international interest to develop and produce viable reusable launch systems, perhaps the most high-profile of these being the NASA-operated Space Shuttle. In conjunction with British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce, a promising design emerged to which the British government contributed £2 million towards its refinement; British engineer Alan Bond was amongst the engineers who worked on HOTOL. However, during 1988, the British government decided to withdraw further funding from the programme, resulting in development work being terminated. Aerospace publication Flight International observed that HOTOL and other competing spaceplane programmes were &quot;over-ambitious&quot; and that development on such launch systems would involve more research and slower progress than previously envisioned.
Following the setback of HOTOL&#x27;s cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, along with John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to establish their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue the development of a viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, Reaction publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named &quot;Skylon&quot; after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight.
Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle&#x27;s development. Reaction has also sought to form ties with other companies with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.

===Project brief===
The Skylon design features several distinct differences when compared with the earlier HOTOL program. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL&#x27;s payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon&#x27;s solution to the issue was to position its engines at the end of its wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle&#x27;s longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.
Reaction intends ultimately to operate as a for-profit commercial enterprise which, upon the completion of development, shall manufacture Skylon vehicles for multiple international customers who shall operate their fleets directly, while being provided with support from Reaction. Skylon has been designed with the target of achieving no less than 200 flights per vehicle. According to the company, its business plan is to sell vehicles for $1 billion each, for which it has forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while recurring costs of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the Reaction intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine precooler, other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon.

In service, Skylon could potentially lower the cost of launching satellites which, according to evidence submitted to the UK parliament by Reaction, is forecast to be around £650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods was estimated to be roughly £15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station. Reaction has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs.

===Funding===
Speaking in June 2011, Reaction estimated that it would require ultimately $12 billion to achieve an operational configuration, which was then estimated to be achieved around 2020, dependent on funding. The obtaining of additional financing for the Skylon programme from the British government has often been difficult. During 2000, Reaction issued an ultimately unsuccessful request for funding from the British government; according to the government, Reaction&#x27;s proposal had involved an offer of a potentially large return on its investment. However, several officials have emerged as proponents and advocated for the official backing of the Skylon programme. Speaking in 2009, the former UK Minister for Science and Innovation, Lord Drayson, stated of Reaction: &quot;This is an example of a British company developing world-beating technology with exciting consequences for the future of space.&quot;

During February 2009, following on from a series of extended discussions with the British National Space Centre (which later became the UK Space Agency), it was announced that a major funding agreement had been established between the British National Space Centre, ESA and Reaction, committing €1 million ($1.28 million) for the purpose of producing a demonstration engine for the Skylon programme by 2011. The initiative, known as the &quot;Technology Demonstration Programme&quot;, was scheduled to last approximately 2.5 years, during which further financing in the form of €1 million was made available by ESA. The 2009 agreement allowed Reaction to involve several external companies, including EADS-owned Astrium, the University of Bristol and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in further development work. As a consequence of the enactment of the Technology Demonstration Programme, Reaction was able to transition from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2/3 up to 4/5 within a matter of months.

By 2012, according to the UK Space Agency, the funding required to develop and construct the entire craft has not yet been secured; as such, research and development work was at that point mainly focused on the engines alone, which was supported by an ESA grant of €1 million. In January 2011, Reaction submitted a proposal to the British Government requesting additional funding for the Skylon project. On 13 April 2011, Reaction announced that the design of the Skylon had passed several rigorous independent reviews. On 24 May 2011, ESA publicly declared the design to be feasible, having found &quot;no impediments or critical items&quot; to be present in the proposal. Speaking on the topic of Skylon in 2011, David Willetts, the UK Minister of State for Universities and Science, stated:
In June 2013, George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated that the British government would be giving £60 million towards the further development of the SABRE engine. The grant was contingent upon Reaction having an industrial partner. The first grant of £50 million was approved by the European Commission in August 2015.

In October 2015, British defence conglomerate BAE Systems entered into an agreement with Reaction Engines, under which it would invest £20.6 million in Reaction to acquire 20% of its share capital, as well as to provide assistance in the development of the SABRE engine.

In July 2016, the second grant of £10 million was approved by ESA.

In September 2017, it was announced that the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had awarded a contract to Reaction Engines for an undisclosed amount to conduct high-temperature airflow testing at a Colorado, United States site of a Reaction Engines precooler called HTX. Testing work is scheduled to start in 2018.

In April 2018, Reaction Engines announced Boeing and Rolls-Royce would be joining BAE Systems as investors in the development of the SABRE engine. A total of $37.5 million of new funding is to be provided including contributions from Baillie Gifford Asset Management and Woodford Investment Management.

===Development===

In 2000, the firm completed work with University of Bristol testing the precooler.

From 2007 to 2009 Reaction worked with University of Bristol and Airborne Engineering on Project STERN (Static Test Expansion/Deflection Rocket Nozzle), which tested Reaction&#x27;s engine ignition system, a Reaction designed air breathing hydrogen rocket engine, and investigated the flow stability and behaviour of Dr Neil Taylor&#x27;s expansion deflection nozzle design via multiple test-firings by Airborne Engineering. An expansion deflection nozzle is capable of compensating for the changing ambient pressure encountered while gaining altitude during atmospheric flight, thus generating greater thrust and thereby efficiency.

Work on STERN was continued in project STRICT (Static Test Rocket Incorporating Cooled Thrust-chamber), which investigated the stability of the engine&#x27;s exhaust flow and the dissipation of the generated heat into the engine walls. The results and designs delivered by both the STRICT and STERN projects were subsequently declared by Reaction to have been &quot;a great success&quot;.

Static testing of the engine precooler began in June 2011, marking the start of Phase 3 in the Skylon development programme, In April 2012, Reaction announced that the first series of the precooler test programme had been successfully completed. On 10 July 2012, Reaction announced that the second of three series of tests has been completed successfully, and the final series of tests would begin the following month after the testing facilities had been upgraded to allow testing of temperatures. ESA&#x27;s propulsion division audited the precooler tests during mid-2012 and found the results satisfactory.

In 2011, Reaction stated that a preproduction prototype of the Skylon could be flying by 2016, and the proposed route would be a suborbital flight between the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana and the North European Aerospace Test Range, located in northern Sweden. Pre-orders were expected in the 2011–2013 timeframe, coinciding with the formation of the manufacturing consortium. In December 2011, Alan Bond stated that Skylon would enter into service by 2021–2022 instead of 2020 as previously envisaged. In July 2012, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain publicly stated that the ESA would be holding a series of talks with Reaction with the aim of developing a further &quot;technical understanding&quot;.
In November 2012, Reaction announced that it would commence work upon a three-and-a-half-year project to develop and build a test rig of the SABRE engine to prove its performance across both the air-breathing and rocket modes. Reaction&#x27;s precooler was tested in 2022 and 2024. Work ceased later in 2024, when the company entered administration.

==Technology and design==

===Overview===

The Skylon is a fully reusable SSTO vehicle, able to achieve orbit without staging, which is intended to be used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (), to attain a peak air-breathing altitude of roughly , where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle&#x27;s re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway.
The design of the Skylon D1 features a large cylindrical payload bay, long and in diameter. It is designed to be comparable with current payload dimensions, and able to support the containerisation of payloads that Reaction Engines envisions being produced in the future. To an equatorial orbit, Skylon could deliver to a altitude or to a altitude. Using interchangeable payload containers, Skylon could be fitted to carry satellites or fluid cargo into orbit, or, in a specialised habitation module, the latter being capable of housing a maximum of 30 astronauts during a single launch. Richard Varvill, technical director at Reaction, stated of Reaction&#x27;s market: &quot;we&#x27;re competing with expendable rockets, a machine that is only used once&quot;.

Because the SABRE engine uses the atmosphere as reaction mass at low altitude, it will have a high specific impulse (around for SABRE 4, or for SABRE 3,) and burn about one fifth of the propellant that would have been required by a conventional rocket. Therefore, Skylon would be able to take off with much less total propellant than conventional systems. The weight reduction enabled by the lower quantity of propellant needed meant that the vehicle would not require as much lift or thrust, which in turn permits the use of smaller engines and allows for the use of a conventional wing configuration. While flying within the atmosphere, the use of wings to counteract gravity drag is more fuel-efficient than simply expelling propellant (as in a rocket), which again serves to reduce the total amount of propellant needed. The payload fraction would be significantly greater than normal rockets and the vehicle should be fully reusable, capable of performing in excess of 200 launches.

===SABRE engines===
One of the most significant features of the Skylon&#x27;s design is its powerplant, known as &quot;Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine&quot; (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of liquid air cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around , altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.

Operating an air-breathing jet engine at velocities of up to Mach 5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims to be a good jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach 5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues have typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.

The SABRE engine design aims to avoid the historic weight-performance issue by using some of the liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine. Once the helium has left the pre-cooler it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach 5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.

===Fuselage and structure===

The currently proposed Skylon model D1 is a large vehicle, possessing a length of and a diameter of . The fuselage of the Skylon is expected to be a silicon carbide reinforced titanium space frame; a light and strong structure that supports the weight of the aluminium fuel tanks and to which the ceramic skin is attached. Multiple layers of titanium foil thermal insulation are sandwiched between the skin and frame to protect the inside of Skylon from the heat of hypersonic flight and the intense heat of re-entry.

Due to the vehicle&#x27;s use of a low-density fuel in the form of liquid hydrogen, a great volume is required to contain enough energy to reach orbit. The propellant is intended to be kept at low pressure to minimise stress; a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during atmospheric reentry compared to other vehicles due to a low ballistic coefficient. Because of the low ballistic coefficient, Skylon would be slowed at higher altitudes where the air is thinner; as a consequence, the skin of the vehicle would reach only . In contrast, the smaller Space Shuttle was heated to on its leading edge, and so employed an extremely heat-resistant but fragile silica thermal protection system. The Skylon design does not require such an approach, instead opting for using a far thinner yet durable reinforced ceramic skin; however, due to turbulent flow around the wings during re-entry, some sections of the vehicle shall need to be provided with active cooling systems.

The Skylon will possess a retractable undercarriage, equipped with high pressure tyres and water-cooled brakes; if any difficulties were to occur just before a take-off, the brakes would be applied to stop the vehicle, the water boiling away to dissipate the heat. During a normal landing, the empty vehicle would be far lighter, and hence the water would not be required, so upon a successful take-off, the of water would be . When this feature was introduced in the C1 model of the design the weight of the brakes was reduced from around .

===Support facilities===
A special runway will be required for launch: it needs to be reinforced to tolerate the high equivalent single wheel load; necessitated by the Skylon&#x27;s 325 tonnes takeoff weight; it will need to have heat resistant sections at the start of the take-off run and at the rotation zone; and it will have to be long to allow the Skylon to accelerate to its rotation speed, yet still have to abort the launch and brake to a standstill if required. At nearly 20,000 feet, this would be the longest paved runway in the world. The Skylon would be able to land on a Code F civil runway.

When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance, with a turnaround time of approximately two days, and be able to complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle.

<text>The Shin Meiwa PS-1 and US-1A is a large STOL aircraft designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and air-sea rescue (SAR) work respectively by Japanese aircraft manufacturer Shin Meiwa. The PS-1 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant is a flying boat which carried its own beaching gear on board, while the search-and-rescue (SAR) orientated US-1A is a true amphibian.

Development of the PS-1 has its origins in flying boat research performed by the Shin Meiwa during the 1950s. The company, believing that their design was capable of regular use upon the open sea, petitioned the Japanese military to acquire the type as a maritime patrol aircraft (MPA). Following the demonstration of a converted Grumman HU-16 Albatross testbed aircraft, referred to as the UF-XS, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) awarded Shin Meiwa a contract in 1966 to further develop its design via two further prototypes, which were designated PS-X. During 1969, the JMSDF placed the first order for an eventual fleet of 21 ASW aircraft, designated PS-1; orders for the SAR variant, designated US-1A, were also issued during the 1970s.

Shin Meiwa were keen to develop additional variants and derivative aircraft, including substantially larger designs which they had studied, but many of these ambitions remained as paper projects only. During the 1980s, the JMSDF decided to adopt land-based Lockheed P-3 Orions, displacing the PS-1s from the ASW role and leading to the variant&#x27;s retirement during 1989. Following the withdrawal of the last active US-1A in 2017, the type has been replaced by the ShinMaywa US-2, a modernised variant.

==Design and development==
===Background===
Following the end of the Second World War and the start of the Occupation of Japan, a ban on aircraft manufacturing imposed during December 1945 required Japan&#x27;s aircraft industry to find other work. During the late 1940s, Japanese aircraft manufacturer Kawanishi Aircraft Company reorganised itself, becoming ShinMeiwa Industries. During the 1950s, the emergence of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the aircraft construction ban being rescinded; Shin Meiwa, which had turned to heavy machinery and engine manufacturing for the intervening years, decided to resurrect their old aircraft works. Initially, the company focused on smaller efforts, such as subcontracting work, the production of drop tanks, and performing airframe overhauls of both Japanese and American aircraft, such as the US Navy&#x27;s Martin P5M Marlin flying boats. However, senior figures, such as chief aircraft designer Shizo Kikuhara and founder Ryuzo Kawanishi were keen to pursue projects of a greater scope.

During the early 1950s, Kawanishi had formed a committee headed by Kikuhara which was tasked with developing seaplane designs that would feature greater seaworthiness. Unlike most seaplanes, they held the ambitious aim of producing an aircraft that could land upon rough seas and encounter little impact from waves and spray. By 1959, the committee felt that it had developed an appropriate design to meet its specification. Two years later Kikuhara, who now headed up the company&#x27;s Amphibian Development Division, was lobbying the Japanese Defense Agency to consider the adoption of a flying boat to meet the nation&#x27;s requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrol aircraft. Shin Meiwa stated that they would produce a specialised design to undertake the ASW mission. Crucial support came from the US Navy, who were keen to see Japan&#x27;s ASW capabilities expand to help track and contain the growing Soviet submarine presence in the Pacific.

===Concept and testing===
To support the development, the US Navy at Shin Meiwa&#x27;s request provided a single Grumman HU-16 Albatross flying boat, which was extensively modified and then reassembled into a flying testbed aircraft, referred to as the &quot;UF-XS&quot;. The converted flying boat featured numerous adaptations, including a novel boundary layer control system to provide enhanced Short Takeoff/Landing (STOL) performance, while the Albatross&#x27;s two Wright R-1820 radial engines were supplemented by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 radial engines on the aircraft&#x27;s modified wings, with an additional General Electric T58 turboshaft inside the aircraft&#x27;s hull to drive the boundary layer control system. The UF-XS also featured a new T-tail arrangement which resembled that of the advanced variant of the Martin P5M-2 Marlin.

From 1962 onwards, the UF-XS performed numerous test flights, demonstrating the improved features which enabled a flying boat to both land and take-off from the open ocean; these tests were closely followed and critiqued by the Japanese military. Over time, the UF-XS continued to be modified to improve its stability and other key performance criteria. In 1966, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) awarded Shin Meiwa a contract to further develop its design to produce a patrol aircraft capable of the ASW mission; accordingly, two further prototypes were constructed under the designation &quot;PS-X&quot;. In addition to Shin Meiwa, other Japanese companies, such as Fuji Heavy Industries and NIPPI Corporation, also played major roles in the PS-X&#x27;s development. The adaptions resulted in significant seaworthiness improvements; during tests conducted in the Kii Channel during 1968, the PS-X successfully landed amid formidable four-meter waves, despite these being in excess of its design goal of three meters.

Having been suitably impressed, during 1969, the JMSDF issued a production order for a batch of 21 aircraft, which were given the designation &quot;PS-1&quot;, to meet its ASW requirement. In spite of its demonstrated performance, the project was not without its critics. The programme soon became politically controversial as its relatively small production run had resulted in an extremely high unit-cost for these aircraft, largely due to the inherent costs involved in the development of brand new aircraft designs. For its part, Shin Meiwa made efforts to commercialise design elements of the aircraft, such as its hydraulics and engine control systems; it exported its rough-sea roll-damping technology to other seaplane companies.

===Further development===

The PS-1 had not been in service long before the JMSDF requested the development of a search-and-rescue (SAR) variant. Shin Meiwa, being keen to pursue the aircraft&#x27;s development, embarked upon fulfilling this request. By deleting much of the PS-1&#x27;s military equipment, room was freed up to provide the aircraft with a greater fuel capacity, retractable landing gear, and rescue equipment. The new variant, which was designated the &quot;US-1A&quot;, could also quickly be converted for troop-carrying. The US-1A was Japan&#x27;s first amphibian, operating from land and sea, which meant that it could transfer survivors to land facilities via ambulance more quickly. First flown on October 15, 1974, it was accepted into service during the following year, and eventually 19 aircraft were purchased. From the seventh aircraft on, an uprated version of the original engine was used, all aircraft were eventually modified to this US-1A standard.

During the 1990s, by which point the US-1A fleet was beginning to show its age, the JMSDF attempted to obtain funding towards acquiring a replacement, but could not secure enough to develop an entirely new aircraft. Therefore, during 1995, ShinMaywa (as Shin Meiwa had been renamed, reportedly so that the name would be easier to pronounce for non-Japanese speakers) set about planning to produce an upgraded version of the US-1A, initially referred to as the US-1A &quot;kai&quot; (&quot;US-1A 改&quot; - &quot;improved US-1A&quot;). This aircraft features numerous aerodynamic refinements and modernised systems, along with a pressurised hull, and the adoption of more powerful Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engines. Flight tests of the new variant began on December 18, 2003. The JMSDF has chosen to purchase up to 14 of these aircraft, which has entered service as the ShinMaywa US-2.

==== Unbuilt concept aircraft ====
In 1977, Shin Meiwa revealed that it had several ideas for its STOL flying boat concept on the drawing board, but ultimately none of these were ever built. They were the &quot;Shin Meiwa LA&quot; (Light Amphibian), a 40-passenger light amphibian for inter-island feeder service; the 400-passenger &quot;Shin Meiwa MA&quot; (Medium Amphibian); the &quot;Shin Meiwa MS&quot; (Medium Seaplane) a 300-passenger long-range flying boat with its own beaching gear; and the gargantuan &quot;Shin Meiwa GS&quot; (Giant Seaplane) with a capacity of 1200 passengers seated on three decks. Unlike the Shin Meiwa LA and MA which were like the US-1 in design, the Shin Meiwa MS and GS had their engines located in front of and above the wing to take advantage of the Coandă effect. In the end, none of the four designs got beyond paper studies.

==Operational history==

Between 1971 and 1978, 21 PS-1 flying boats entered service with the JMSDF; starting in 1973, they were operated as Fleet Air Wing 31. The PS-1 ASW variant carried homing torpedoes, depth charges and 127mm Zuni rockets as offensive armament, but lacked any defensive weapons. It was equipped with dipping sonar, which had limited use as it required the aircraft to land on water to deploy. It could also carry 20 sonobuoys. It had a crew of ten: pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, navigator and six sensor/weapons operators. On a typical ASW mission, a PS-1 would range over hundreds of square miles of ocean, landing between 12 and 16 times to dip its sonar.

The type was capable of numerous feats, such as being able to routinely land in seas with waves of up to in height. Water distance for takeoff or landing with aircraft weight was with no wind or into a 15-knot wind. Apart from the boundary layer control system, which was powered by an independent gas turbine housed within the fuselage, the aircraft had a number of other innovative features, including a system to suppress spray during water handling, and directing the propwash from the aircraft&#x27;s four turboprop engines over its wings to create yet more lift.

During 1976, a single PS-1 was experimentally modified to perform aerial firefighting missions; it possessed an internal capacity of of water. During the 1980s, the JMSDF decided to replace the PS-1 in the ASW role with land-based Lockheed P-3 Orions; the last examples of the ASW variant were phased out of service in 1989. It was outlived by the Search-and-Rescue oriented US-1A fleet, which continued to be used into the 21st century.

The US-1A&#x27;s first rescue was from a Greek vessel in 1976. Despite having been envisioned largely to perform air-sea rescues of military personnel, the US-1A has mostly been involved in civilian assistance operations. Between 1976 and 1999, Japan&#x27;s US-1A fleet has reported been used in over 500 rescues and were responsible for the saving of 550 lives. The US-1A was retired on December 13, 2017, when the last example in JMSDF service conducted its final flight. According to aviation periodical Air International, a total of 827 people have been rescued by US-1s since the type had entered service during 1976. It has been succeeded in its role by the modernised US-2.

<doc id="550948" wikidata="Q1343105" url="?curid=550948" title="Genetic sexual attraction">
<text>Genetic sexual attraction is a hypothesis that attraction may be a product of genetic similarities. While there is scientific evidence for the position, some commentators regard the hypothesis as pseudoscience. The term is also used for a phenomenon in which biologically related persons separated at a young age develop intense feelings—including sexual attraction—upon the restoration of contact.

== Background ==
The term was popularized in the United States in the late 1980s by Barbara Gonyo, the founder of Truth Seekers in Adoption, a Chicago-based support group for adoptees and their new-found relatives. Gonyo first heard the term used during an American Adoption Congress conference in the early 1980s. She developed sexual feelings for her son when she met him after he was adopted away, but he did not want to be part of any such contact.

Psychologists theorize that the reported phenomenon of attraction to biological relatives separated at a young age occurs because the separation forecloses the Westermarck effect, which normally desensitizes biologically related persons to later sexual attraction. Another suggested explanation for the phenomenon is possible narcissistic feelings.

Although reported frequently in the field of psychology, there are some studies showing that people are sexually attracted to those genetically similar to them. Studies of MHC genes show that people are attracted to those genetically similar to them. However, in mice, this lack of attraction can be reversed by adoption.

Catherine MacAskill, an adoption and child sexual abuse expert, has suggested that &quot;genetic sexual attraction&quot; cases seem to be associated with sudden unplanned meetings which lack the proper safeguards of a thoroughly prepared reunion.

==Criticism==
Critics of the hypothesis have called it pseudoscience. In a &quot;Salon&quot; piece, Amanda Marcotte called the concept &quot;half-baked pseudoscientific nonsense that people dreamed up to justify continuing unhealthy, abusive relationships&quot;. The use of &quot;GSA&quot; as an initialism has also been criticized, since it gives the notion that the phenomenon is an actual diagnosable &quot;condition&quot;. 

Many have noted the lack of research on the subject. While acknowledging the &quot;phenomenon of genetic sexual attraction&quot;, Eric Anderson, a sociologist and sexologist, noted in a 2012 book that &quot;[t]here is only one academic research article&quot; on the subject, and he critiqued the paper for using &quot;Freudian psycho-babble&quot;.

<text>Danzón is the official musical genre and dance of Cuba. It is also an active musical form in Mexico and Puerto Rico. 
Written in time, the danzón is a slow, formal partner dance, requiring set footwork around syncopated beats, and incorporating elegant pauses while the couples stand listening to virtuoso instrumental passages, as characteristically played by a charanga or típica ensemble.

The danzón evolved from the Cuban contradanza, or habanera ( &#x27;Havana-dance&#x27;). The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the country dance and contredanse, was probably introduced to Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511–1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants. It may also have been partially seeded during the short-lived British occupation of Havana in 1762. Haitian refugees fleeing the island&#x27;s revolution of 1791–1804 brought the French-Haitian kontradans, contributing their own Creole syncopation. In Cuba, the dances of European origin acquired new stylistic features derived from African rhythm and dance to produce a genuine fusion of European and African influences. African musical traits in the danzón include complex instrumental cross-rhythms, expressed in staggered cinquillo and tresillo patterns.

By 1879, the year Miguel Failde&#x27;s &quot;Las alturas de Simpson&quot; was first performed (in Matanzas), danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Danzón went on to interact with 20th century Cuban genres such as son, and through the danzón-mambo it was instrumental in the development of mambo and cha-cha-chá.

== History ==

The danzón developed from the habanera, a creolized Cuban dance form. By 1879, the year &quot;Las alturas de Simpson&quot; composed by Miguel Failde (leader of the Orquesta Faílde) was first performed in Matanzas, danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Creation of the new danzón form is generally attributed to Faílde. The classical composer Manuel Saumell has also been cited as a key figure in its delineation.

=== Precursors: figure dances ===
The English contradanza was the predecessor of the &quot;habanera&quot;, also known as danza criolla. Out of this Creole genre, the Habanera, was born in 1879 another Cuban genre, called danzon, a sequence dance, in which all danced together a set of &quot;figures&quot;. The first use of the term &quot;danzón&quot;, which dates from the 1850s, is for just such a dance. Havana&#x27;s daily paper, &quot;El Triunfo&quot;, gave a description of this earlier
danzón. It was a co-ordinated dance of figures performed by groups of Matanzas blacks. The dancers held the ends of colored ribbons, and carried flower-covered arches. The group twisted and entwined the ribbons to make pleasing patterns. This account can be corroborated by other references, for example, a traveler in Cuba noted in 1854 that black Cubans &quot;do a kind of wreath dance, in which the whole company took part, amid innumerable artistic entanglements and disentanglements&quot;. This style of danzón was performed at carnival comparsas by black groups: it is described that way before the late 1870s.

Faílde&#x27;s first danzóns were created for just such sequence dances. Faílde himself said &quot;In Matanzas at this time there was a kind of square dance for twenty couples who carried arches and flowers. It was really a dance of figures (sequence dance), and its moves were adapted to the tempo of the habanera, which we took over for the danzón.&quot;

=== Structure and instruments ===
The form of danzón created by Miguel Faílde in 1879 (&quot;Las alturas de Simpson&quot;), begins with an &quot;introduction&quot; (four bars) and &quot;paseo&quot; (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and paseo again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that&#x27;s hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes.
Early danzón was played by groups called &quot;orquestas típicas&quot;, which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments (cornet, valve trombone, ophicleide), a clarinet or two, a violin or two and tympani (kettle drums). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the &quot;charanga&quot; emerged (see Early Cuban bands). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, timbales, güiro, and doublebass. Charanga and típicas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the típica were over.

In 1898, a piano was included in a charanga for the first time. In Antonio María Romeu&#x27;s hands a piano became standard. Its musical flexibility, its ability to influence both melody and rhythm, made it invaluable. In 1926, in his arrangement of &quot;Tres lindas cubanas&quot;, Romeu incorporated a piano &quot;solo&quot; for the first time. His was Cuba&#x27;s top charanga for many years.

=== Initial perception ===
Similar to other dances in the Caribbean and Latin America, the danzón was initially regarded as scandalous, especially when it began to be danced by all classes of society. The slower rhythm of the danzón led to couples dancing closer, with sinuous movements of the hips and a lower centre of gravity. The author of a survey of prostitution in Havana devoted a whole chapter to the iniquities of dancing, and the danzón in particular. Articles in newspapers and periodicals took up the theme:

:&quot;Because I love my country, it hurts me to see danzón at gatherings of decent people.&quot;
:&quot;We recommend banning the danza and danzón because they are vestiges of Africa and should be replaced by essentially European dances such as the quadrille and rigadoon.&quot;

Apparently, the danzón, which later became an insipid dance for older couples, was at first danced with &quot;obscene movements&quot; of the hips by young couples in close embrace, with bodies touching, and by couples who might come from different races...

:&quot;First we had the danza, then came the danzón... next it will be the rumba, and finally we&#x27;ll all end up dancing ñáñigo!&quot;

So, behind the concern about music and dance were concerns about sexual licence, and about miscegenation, the mixing of races. As with other similar cases, the criticism was to no avail. The danzón became hugely popular, and was the dominant popular music in Cuba until the advent of the son in the 1920s. At length the Cuban government made Faílde the official inventor of the danzón – &quot;but not until 1960&quot;, by which time the danzón had become a relic, and its &#x27;child&#x27;, the chachachá, had taken over.

=== Influence of son ===

In 1910, some 30 years after Faílde&#x27;s early days, José Urfé added a montuno as a final part of his &quot;El Bombín de Barretto&quot;. This was a swinging section, consisting of a repeated musical phrase, which introduced something of the son into the danzón (a tactic which was to recur again). Because of the popularity of son in the 1920s and 1930s, Aniceto Díaz in &quot;Rompiendo la rutina&quot; in 1929 added a vocal part, thereby creating a new genre called the danzonete.
Later development led to more syncopation, which eventually led to the danzón-chá, nuevo ritmo, cha-cha-chá, pachanga and mambo. From the 1940s to the 1960s danzón and its derivatives were highly popular in Cuba, with several truly fine charangas playing most days of the week. Orquesta Aragón kept up an exceptionally high standard for many years, but the danzón itself gradually dropped out, and is now a relic dance.

Danzón has never ceased to influence Cuban musicians, and it is reflected in many popular Cuban music genres, in Cuban Latin jazz, salsa, songo and timba, the latter building upon the charanga orchestration. Groups like Los Van Van and Orquesta Revé developed from charangas. Their make-up and orchestration (by Juan Formell) has been so greatly altered that it is difficult to identify traces of danzón; indeed, their present styles owe more to son than to danzón. The addition of brass instruments such as trombones and trumpets, and conga drums signalled a wider range of music.

== Mexican Danzón ==
Danzón was also very popular in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Mexico, because of the strong Cuban influence in the region. Later on, danzón developed in Mexico City, specially in the famous &quot;Salón México&quot;; it has survived as a dance longer there than in Cuba. Danzón also flourished in the city of Oaxaca, and many famous danzones were composed by Oaxacan musicians such as the famous Nereidas and Teléfono de larga distancia, both works of Amador Pérez Dimas, from the town of Zaachila, near Oaxaca city.

Today, people still dance danzón in Mexico, particularly in the main plazas of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Mexico City, and in yearly festivals across Mexico. The dance had a second revival in the 1990s, especially among Mexico&#x27;s senior citizens.

A film called &quot;Danzón&quot; was released in 1991 directed by María Novaro.

==Concert music==
&quot;Danzón no. 2&quot; by Mexican composer Arturo Márquez (b. 1950) is a popular piece in orchestral concerts.

==Rhythmic structure==

The basic timbales part for danzón is called the baqueteo. In the example above, the slashed noteheads indicate muted drum strokes, and the regular noteheads indicate open strokes. The güiro also plays this pattern. The danzón was the first written music to be based on the organizing principle of sub-Saharan African rhythm, known in Cuba as clave.

== Style and form structure ==
Danzón is elegant and virtuoso music, with dance. A danzón, in its original form, was not sung, and did not feature any improvisations, unlike some other Cuban genres.
A danzón has the following typical structure:
*An &quot;introduction&quot; or &quot;paseo&quot; (A), usually 16 bars.
*The &quot;theme&quot; or principal melody (B), featuring the flute, thus often referred to as &quot;parte de (la) flauta&quot;.
*A repeat of the introduction.
*The &quot;trio&quot; (C), featuring the strings, thus also called &quot;parte del violín&quot;.
*Ending. This could either be a cliché ending (there are a few standard danzón endings), another repeat of the introduction, or a combination of both.
The classic form is thus ABAC or ABACA.
A danzón-chá or danzón-mambo typically add another part (D), a syncopated open vamp in which soloists may sometimes improvise, creating an ABACD or, more common, ABACAD.

== Mambo section ==

In danzón, the mambo section is the final section of an arrangement. It was first devised by Orestes López, who added syncopated motifs taken from the son, together with improvised flute variations. He called this type of danzón &quot;ritmo nuevo&quot; (new rhythm). Orestes&#x27; danzón &quot;Mambo&quot; was the start of a trend continued by &quot;Arcaño y sus Maravillas&quot;.

<text>The Torres Strait Islands are an archipelago of at least 274 small islands in the Torres Strait, a waterway separating far northern continental Australia&#x27;s Cape York Peninsula and the island of New Guinea. They span an area of , but their total land area is .

The Islands are inhabited by the indigenous Torres Strait Islanders. Lieutenant James Cook first claimed British sovereignty over the eastern part of Australia at Possession Island in 1770, but British administrative control only began in the Torres Strait Islands in 1862. The islands are now mostly part of Queensland, a constituent State of the Commonwealth of Australia, but are administered by the Torres Strait Regional Authority, a statutory authority of the Australian federal government. A few islands very close to the coast of mainland New Guinea belong to the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, most importantly Daru Island and its provincial capital, Daru.

Only 17 of the islands are inhabited. The Torres Strait Islands&#x27; population was recorded at 4,514 in the 2016 Australian census, with 91.8% of these identifying as Indigenous Torres Strait Island peoples. Although counted as Indigenous Australians, Torres Strait Islander peoples, being predominantly Melanesian, are ethnically and culturally different from Aboriginal Australians.

== History ==
The Portuguese Explorer Luís Vaez de Torres sailed the Torres Strait in 1606. Torres had joined the expedition of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, which sailed west from Peru across the Pacific Ocean, in search of Terra Australis.
Lieutenant James Cook first claimed British sovereignty in 1770 over the eastern part of Australia at Possession Island, calling it New South Wales in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third.

British administrative control did not begin until 1862 in the Torres Strait Islands, marked by the appointment of John Jardine, police magistrate at Rockhampton, as Government Resident in the Torres Straits. He originally established a small settlement on Albany Island, but on 1 August 1864 he settled at Somerset Island. Although the Torres Strait Islanders had long dived for pearl shells themselves, the international industry of pearl and trochus shells, for using the mother of pearl as decoration, started in earnest in the 1860s. By the 1890s, the islands were supplying more than 50 per cent of the world&#x27;s pearl shells.

The London Missionary Society (LMS) mission, led by Rev. Samuel Macfarlane, arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) on 1 July 1871. After the Anglican Church took over their mission in the 20th century, they referred to the events as &quot;The Coming of the Light&quot;, and established an annual celebration on 1 July.

In 1872, the boundary of Queensland was extended to include Thursday Island and other islands in Torres Strait within 60 miles of the Queensland coast.

In June 1875, a measles epidemic killed about 25% of the population, with some islands suffering losses of up to 80%, as the islanders had no natural immunity to European diseases.

In 1879, Queensland annexed the other Torres Strait Islands. They were classified as part of the British colony of Queensland and, after 1901, of the Australian state of Queensland. But some of them lie just off the coast of New Guinea.

In 1885, John Douglas was appointed as Government Resident Magistrate residing on Thursday Island. He made periodic tours of all the islands and was known to all the natives. He established the system under which the hereditary native chief of each island was installed as chief magistrate, supporting the local traditional system. He also established Native Police, but the only island on which the Native Police were armed was Saibai. There they were provided with Snider carbines to repel the attacks of the Marind-anim (formerly known as Tugeri), the headhunters who raided the islands from their territory on the New Guinea coast.

In 1898–1899, the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition led by Alfred Cort Haddon visited the Torres Strait Islands. Among its members was W. H. R. Rivers, who later gained notability for his work in psychology and treating officers in the Great War. They collected and took about 2000 cultural artefacts, ostensibly to save them from destruction by missionaries. But all of the artefacts collected by Samuel Macfarlane were sold in London, mostly to European museums.

===20th century to present===
In 1904, the peoples of the Torres Strait Islands were made subject to the &quot;Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897&quot;, which gave powers to the Queensland government in placing legal restrictions on natives and on their land use.

In 1899, John Douglas had initiated a process of electing island councils, intended to loosen the power of missionaries in the islands. They had become powerful by default because the government did not have resources to administer the territory. In the Western islands, where the traditional lifestyle was semi-nomadic, the council system continued to thrive.

During World War II, many Torres Strait Islanders served in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion of the Australian Army. It is the only Australian Army unit to have been formed out of indigenous Australians. 

From 1960 to 1973, Margaret Lawrie captured some of the Torres Strait Islander people&#x27;s culture by recording their recounting of local myths and legends. Her anthropological work, stored at the State Library of Queensland, has recently been recognised and registered with the Australian UNESCO Memory of the World Programme.

The proximity of the islands to Papua New Guinea became an issue when the territory started moving to gain independence from Australia, which it gained in 1975. The Papua New Guinea government objected to the position of the border close to the New Guinean mainland, and the subsequent complete control that Australia exercised over the waters of the strait. The Torres Strait Islanders opposed being separated from Australia and insisted on no change to the border. The Australian Federal government wished to cede the northern islands to appease Papua New Guinea, but were opposed by the Queensland government and Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

An agreement was struck in 1978 whereby the islands and their inhabitants remained Australian, but the maritime boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea was defined as running through the centre of the strait. In practice the two countries co-operate closely in the management of the strait&#x27;s resources.

In 1982, Eddie Mabo and four other Torres Strait Islander people from Mer (Murray Island) started legal proceedings to establish their traditional land ownership. Because Mabo was the first-named plaintiff, it became known as the Mabo Case. In 1992, after ten years of hearings before the Queensland Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia, the latter court found that the Mer people had owned their land prior to annexation by Queensland. This ruling overturned the long-established legal doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot; (&quot;no-one&#x27;s land&quot;), which held that native title over Crown land in Australia had been extinguished at the time of annexation. The ruling thus has had far-reaching significance for the land claims of both Torres Strait Islanders and Australian Aboriginal people. Its effects are still being felt in the 21st century, as indigenous communities establish claims to their traditional lands under the Native Title Act of 1993.

On 1 July 1994, the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) was created. In March 2008, fifteen Torres Strait Islander Councils were amalgamated into a single body to form a Torres Strait Island Regional Council, or Torres Strait Island Region, created by the Queensland Government in the interest of financial viability, and accountability and transparency of local governments throughout the State. It is administered from Thursday Island, but Thursday, Horn Island, Prince of Wales Island and many others are under the Shire of Torres council.

In the , the population of the Torres Strait Islands was 4,514, of whom 4,144 (91.8%) were Torres Strait Islanders. These inhabitants live on only 14 of the 274 islands. For comparison, people identifying themselves as of Torres Strait Islander descent living in the whole of Australia numbered 32,345, while those of both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal descent numbered a further 26,767.

== Geography ==
The islands span an area of some . The strait from Cape York to New Guinea has a width of approximately at its narrowest point; the islands lie scattered in between, extending some from furthest east to furthest west. The total land area of the islands comprises . of land are used for agricultural purposes.

The Torres Strait itself was previously part of a land bridge known as the Arafura Plain which connected the present-day Australian continent with New Guinea (in a single landmass called Sahul, Meganesia, Australia-New Guinea). This land bridge was most recently submerged by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice-age glaciation approximately 12,000 years ago, forming the Strait which now connects the Arafura and Coral seas. Many of the western Torres Strait Islands are the remaining peaks of this land bridge which were not completely submerged when the ocean levels rose.

The islands and their surrounding waters and reefs provide a highly diverse set of land and marine ecosystems, with niches for many rare or unique species. Saltwater crocodiles inhabit the islands along with neighbouring areas of Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Marine animals of the islands include dugongs (an endangered species of sea mammal widely found throughout the Indian Ocean and tropical Western Pacific, including Papua-New Guinean and Australian waters), as well as green, ridley, hawksbill and flatback sea turtles.

The Torres Strait Islands may be grouped into five distinct clusters, which exhibit differences of geology and formation as well as location. The Torres Strait provides a habitat for numerous birds, including the Torresian imperial-pigeon, which is seen as the iconic national emblem to the islanders.

These islands are also a distinct physiographic section of the larger Cape York Platform province, which in turn is part of the larger East Australian Cordillera physiographic division.

=== Top Western islands (Gudaw Maluligal Nation) ===
The islands in this cluster lie very close to the southwestern coastline of New Guinea (the closest is less than offshore). Saibai (one of the largest of the Torres Strait Islands) and Boigu (one of the Talbot Islands) are low-lying islands which were formed by deposition of sediments and mud from New Guinean rivers into the Strait accumulating on decayed coral platforms. Vegetation on these islands mainly consists of mangrove swamps, and they are prone to flooding.

The other main island in this group, Dauan (Mt Cornwallis), is a smaller island with steep hills, composed largely of granite. This island actually represents the northernmost extent of the Great Dividing Range, the extensive series of mountain ranges which runs along almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia. This peak became an island as the ocean levels rose at the end of the last ice age.

The isolated and uninhabited Deliverance Island is west of Boigu, the nearest of the Top Western islands.

=== Near Western islands (Maluligal Nation) ===
The islands in this cluster lie south of the Strait&#x27;s midway point, and are also largely high granite hills with mounds of basaltic outcrops, formed from old peaks of the now submerged land bridge. Moa (Banks Island) is the second-largest in the Torres Strait, and Badu (Mulgrave Island) is slightly smaller and fringed with extensive mangrove swamps. Other smaller islands include Mabuiag, Pulu and further to the east Naghir (correct form Nagi, aka Mount Ernest Island). Culturally this was the most complex part of Torres Strait, containing three of the four groupings/dialects of the Western-central Islanders, Nagi being culturally/linguistically a Central Island (Kulkalaig territory, specifically part of Waraber tribal waters), Moa is part of the Muwalaig-Italaig-Kaiwalaig [Kauraraig/Kaurareg] tribal areas, with two groups, the Italaig of the south, and the Muwalaig of the north. Many Kauraraig also live there, having been forcibly moved there in 1922–1923. Badu and Mabuiag are the Maluigal &quot;Deep Sea People&quot;.

=== Inner islands (Kaiwalagal Kawrareg Aboriginal Nation) ===
These islands, also known as the Thursday Island group, lie closest to Cape York Peninsula, and their topography and geological history is very similar. Muralag (Prince of Wales Island) is the largest of the Strait&#x27;s islands, and forms the centre of this closely grouped cluster. The much smaller Waiben Thursday Island is the region&#x27;s administrative centre and most heavily populated. Several of these islands have permanent freshwater springs, and some were also mined for gold in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because of their proximity to the Australian mainland, they have also been centres of pearling and fishing industries. Nurupai Horn Island holds the region&#x27;s airport, and as a result is something of an entrepôt with inhabitants drawn from many other communities. Kiriri (Hammond Island) is the other permanently settled island of this group; Tuined (Possession Island) is noted for Lt. James Cook&#x27;s landing there in 1770. Moa in the Near Western group is culturally and linguistically speaking part of this group.

=== Central islands (Kulkalgal Nation) ===
This cluster is more widely distributed in the middle of Torres Strait, consisting of many small sandy cays surrounded by coral reefs, similar to those found in the nearby Great Barrier Reef. The more northerly islands in this group however, such as Gerbar (Two Brothers) and Iama (Yam Island), are high basaltic outcrops, not cays. Nagi is a culturo-linguistic part of this group, and also has high basaltic outcropping. The low-lying inhabited coral cays, such as Poruma (Coconut Island), Warraber Island and Masig (Yorke Island) are mostly less than long, and no wider than . Several have had problems with saltwater intrusion.

=== Eastern islands (Kemer Kemer Meriam Nation) ===
The islands of this group (principally Mer (Murray Island), Dauar and Waier, with Erub Island and Stephen Island (Ugar) further north) are formed differently from the rest. They are volcanic in origin, the peaks of volcanoes which were active in Pleistocene times. Consequently, their hillsides have rich and fertile red volcanic soils, and are thickly vegetated. The easternmost of these are less than from the northern extension of the Great Barrier Reef.

==Symbolism of the flag design==

The national flag features a white Dhari (headdress) and, underneath, a white five-pointed star, symbolising &quot;peace, the five major island groups and the navigational importance of stars to the seafaring people of the Torres Strait&quot;. The five points of the star on the flag represent the following regions (which do not match administrative regions):
* Northern Division (Boigu, Dauan, Saibai)
* Eastern Islands (Erub, Mer, Ugar)
* Western Division (St. Pauls, Kubin, Badu, Mabuiag)
* Central Division (Masig, Poruma, Warraber, Iama)
* Southern Division (Thursday, Horn, Prince of Wales and Hammond Islands, NPA and Mainland Australia)

A celebration known as Flag Day takes place on 29 May each year, the anniversary of the day the flag was officially presented to the people of the Torres Strait.

== Administration ==
===Regional Authority===

The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA), an Australian Commonwealth statutory authority created in 1994, exercises governance over the islands. The TSRA has an elected board comprising 20 representatives from the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal communities resident in the Torres Strait region.

One representative per established local community wins election to the board under the &quot;Queensland Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984&quot; and Division 5 of the &quot;ATSIC Act 1989&quot;. The TSRA itself falls under the portfolio responsibilities of the Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (previously under the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs). Thursday Island functions as the administrative centre of the islands.

The TSRA now represents the local communities at both Commonwealth and State levels; previously, State representation operated via a Queensland statutory authority called the Island Coordinating Council (ICC). The Torres Strait Island Region local government area superseded the ICC in March 2008.

In March 2008, fifteen Torres Strait Islander Councils were amalgamated into a single body to form a Torres Strait Island Regional Council, or Torres Strait Island Region, created by the Queensland Government in the interest of financial viability, and accountability and transparency of local Governments throughout the State. It is administered from Thursday Island, but Thursday, Horn Island, Prince of Wales Island and many others are under the Shire of Torres council.

===Local (shire) level government===

At the local level, there are two authorities. One is the Shire of Torres, which governs several islands and portions of Cape York Peninsula and operates as a Queensland local government area.

The other is the Torres Strait Island Region, created in 2008, which embodies 15 former island councils. These former councils had been previously relinquished by the Government of Queensland to specific Islander and Aboriginal Councils under the provisions of the &quot;Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984&quot; and the &quot;Community Services (Aboriginal) Act 1984&quot;), consisting of:
* Badu Island Council
* Bamaga Island Council
* Boigu Island Council
* Dauan Island Council
* Erub Island Council
* Hammond Island Council
* Iama Island Council
* Kubin Island Council
* Mabuiag Island Council
* Mer Island Council
* Poruma Island Council
* Saibai Island Council
* Seisia Island Council
* St Pauls Island Council
* St Patrick Island council
* Ugar Island Council
* Warraber Island Council
* Yorke Island Council
== Localities ==
This shows the localities of the Torres Strait Islands in alphabetical order.
==Independence movement==
Politicians who have declared support for independence, include Bob Katter and former Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, who in August 2011 wrote to Prime Minister Julia Gillard in support of Torres Strait Islands independence from Australia; Prime Minister Gillard said in October 2011 &quot;her government will respectfully consider the Torres Strait&#x27;s request for self-government&quot;. Other figures who have supported independence include Australian Indigenous rights campaigner Eddie Mabo.

==Languages==

Torres Strait Islander peoples, the indigenous peoples of the islands, are predominantly Melanesians, culturally most akin to the coastal peoples of Papua New Guinea. Thus, they are regarded as being distinct from Aboriginal peoples of Australia and are generally referred to separately, despite ongoing historical trade and inter-marriage with mainland Aboriginal people. There are also two Torres Strait Islander communities on the nearby coast of the mainland, Bamaga and Seisia.

According to the Torres Strait Treaty, residents of Papua New Guinea are permitted to visit the Torres Strait Islands for traditional purposes.

There are three languages spoken on the islands. The two indigenous languages are the Western-Central Torres Strait Language (called by various names, including Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Kalaw Kawaw Ya, Kulkalgau Ya and Kaiwaligau Ya), and the Eastern Torres Language Meriam Mir.

Yumplatok (also known as Torres Strait Creole and Broken) is a contemporary Torres Strait Island language spoken in the Torres Strait. The contact with missionaries, traders and other English speakers since the 19th century led to the development of a pidgin language. It developed more fully as a creole language, with its own distinctive sound system, grammar, vocabulary, usage and meaning. Torres Strait Creole is spoken by most Torres Strait Islanders and is a mixture of Standard Australian English and traditional indigenous languages. It is an English-based creole; however, each island has its own version of creole. Torres Strait Creole is also spoken on the Australian mainland, including in the Northern Peninsula Area Region and coastal communities such as Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Brisbane.

==Climate change==

The Torres Strait Islands are threatened by rising sea levels, especially those islands which do not rise more than above sea level. Storm surges and high tides pose the greatest danger. Other developing problems include erosion, property damage, drinking water contamination and the unearthing of the dead. As of June 2010, there were no relocation strategies in place for Torres Strait Islanders. By 2021, at least one freshwater well had turned to salt water.

In early 2020, it was reported that Warraber is particularly threatened by rising sea levels, and coastal defences have been built on many of the beaches on the island. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that by 2100, tides will rise , depending on the timing and level of cuts to carbon emissions. Several of the smaller islands in the group are also under threat. Construction of sea walls has begun on Boigu Island, and Masig Island is next in line.

===Torres Strait 8===
A group of eight people from the small, low-lying islands of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig, who became known as the Torres Strait 8, lodged a complaint against the Australian Government with the UN Human Rights Committee in May 2019, based on the claim that their human rights were being violated by the government&#x27;s lack of efforts to protect the people of the Strait from the effects of climate change. Their complaint has been supported by the current and previous UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, David Boyd and John Knox respectively. The group is also seeking an opinion from the International Court of Justice as to whether they would be eligible to seek compensation from countries or large companies for losses brought about by climate change.

In 2020 the Torres Strait 8 were recognised as one of ten &quot;Human Rights Heroes&quot; in the Human Rights Awards, in a special category replacing the usual awards.

In September 2022, the UN Human Rights Committee gave its response to the Torres Strait 8. It concluded that Australia had violated two of three human rights described in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty signed in 1966 by 173 member states of the UN, including Australia. The violated rights are &quot;the right to enjoy their culture&quot; and &quot;[to] be free from arbitrary interferences with their private life, family and home&quot;. The committee did not find that their right to life had been violated. There is no means by which to enforce the finding, but states generally comply. While the Morrison government had called for dismissal of the complaint, the Albanese government (since early 2022) was committed to working with Torres Strait Islanders on climate change. The committee called on the government to compensate the islanders for the harm already inflicted, &quot;consult the community on their needs and take action to secure their safety&quot;.

==Disease control==
The banana plant leaf disease black sigatoka, the major banana disease worldwide, is endemic to Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands. Occasional infections have been discovered on Cape York Peninsula but they have been successfully halted with eradication programs. The disease most likely appeared on the mainland via plant material from the Torres Strait Islands.

== Music ==
The music of the Torres Strait is principally vocal accompanied by instruments. The introduction of Christianity through the London Missionary Society, beginning in 1871, had a profound influence, but before that time the musical culture reflected the cultural and geographic diversity of the Strait.

<text>The pied thrush (Geokichla wardii) is a member of the thrush family found in India and Sri Lanka. The males are conspicuously patterned in black and white while the females are olive brown and speckled. They breed in the central Himalayan forests and winter in the hill forests of southern India and Sri Lanka. Like many other thrushes, they forage on leaf litter below forest undergrowth and fly into trees when disturbed and sit still making them difficult to locate.

==Description==
Males of this thrush are conspicuously black and white. Mostly black on the upper parts it has a long white supercilium, and white tips to the wing coverts, tertials, rump and tail. The underparts are white with black flank spots the bill and legs are yellow. Females and young birds have the same basic pattern, but the black is replaced by dark brown, and the white by light brown. The markings on the underside are scalier. The third primary is the longest followed by the fourth with the second and fifth being nearly equal in length. The first primary is reduced.

The bill is not as strongly curved as that of the dark-sided thrush or the long-billed thrush and the female lacks the prominent pale cheek spot of the similar looking female Siberian thrush.

The binomial commemorates Samuel Neville Ward (1813–1897), a British colonial administrator in India from 1832 to 1863. Jerdon and Charles Darwin corresponded with S.N. Ward who worked in the Madras Civil Service, posted for sometime at Sirsi and was known for his natural history studies and artistic talent.

Thomas C. Jerdon who first obtained a specimen of the species from Ward notes:
The species was variously placed in the past and for a long time in the genus &quot;Zoothera&quot; along with many other thrushes but molecular phylogenetic studies in 2008 clarified the phylogeny and the requirements for monophyly of the genera led to the older genus &quot;Geokichla&quot; being resurrected. The genus &quot;Zoothera&quot; now contains species that are not strongly sexually dimorphic unlike &quot;Geokichla&quot;. The pied thrush&#x27;s closest relative is the Siberian thrush &quot;Geokichla sibirica&quot;.

==Distribution==
The summer breeding range is from western Himachal Pradesh in the Himalayas east at least until central Nepal. Records from further east such as Sikkim have been questioned by Rasmussen and Anderton (2005). The pied thrush is migratory, wintering mainly in Sri Lanka, with smaller numbers in the hills of south India. During passage, they may be preyed on by crows.

Although rare, they are locally and seasonally seen regularly at certain locations in winter such as at Victoria Park in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka, where a number of birds gather by the stream early in the morning or in some hills stations in southern India such as Nandi Hills and Yercaud.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They forage alone or in pairs, often seen on the ground but flying into the trees and perching still when disturbed. The pied thrush, like many &quot;Zoothera&quot; thrushes, can be quite secretive. Pied thrushes are omnivorous, but eat more insects than fruit. They form loose flocks in winter.

The breeding season is May to July and the nest is a deep cup lined with grass and cemented with mud and placed in a low tree fork. The clutch consists of 3–4 white or bluish eggs. This uncommon species breeds in the Himalayas between in thick woodland. The wintering areas are similar but include less well-wooded areas, and are generally at altitude.

Their song is not considered as musical as those of many others thrushes and consists of a series of squeaky notes followed by short trills.

<doc id="550963" wikidata="Q5356986" url="?curid=550963" title="Famine, Affluence, and Morality">
<text>&quot;Famine, Affluence, and Morality&quot; is an essay written by Peter Singer in 1971 and published in &quot;Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs&quot; in 1972. It argues that affluent persons are morally obligated to donate far more resources to humanitarian causes than is considered normal in Western cultures. The essay was inspired by the starvation of Bangladesh Liberation War refugees, and uses their situation as an example, although Singer&#x27;s argument is general in scope and not limited to the example of Bangladesh. The essay is anthologized widely as an example of Western ethical thinking.

== Summary ==
One of the core arguments of this essay is that, if one can use one&#x27;s wealth to reduce suffering—for example, by aiding famine-relief efforts—without any significant reduction in the well-being of oneself or others, it is immoral not to do so. Singer introduces the &quot;drowning child&quot; argument or drowning child analogy. According to Singer, inaction is clearly immoral if a child is drowning in a shallow pond and someone &quot;can&quot; save it but chooses not to; nor does placing greater geographical distance between the person in need and the potential helper reduce the latter&#x27;s moral obligations:

It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor&#x27;s child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. ... The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously, ... this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.

The affluent, says Singer, are consistently guilty of failing to recognize this, having large amounts of surplus wealth that they do not use to aid humanitarian projects in developing nations.

Here is the thrust of Singer&#x27;s argument:

*&quot;Suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care are bad&quot;.
*&quot;If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it&quot;.
*&quot;It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor&#x27;s child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away&quot;.
*&quot;The principle makes no distinction between cases in which I am the only person who could possibly do anything and cases in which I am just one among millions in the same position&quot;.

==Reception and criticism==
Philosopher Gilbert Harman considered &quot;Famine, Affluence, and Morality&quot; to be one of the most famous articles in ethics. In 1981, philosopher James Rachels said of the article: &quot;one felt intellectual interest in the argument, but also guilt for not having contributed more money to relieve starvation&quot;.

A common criticism of Singer&#x27;s essay is the demandingness objection. For example, the &quot;supposed obligation&quot; of Singer&#x27;s essay has been criticised by John Arthur in 1982, by John Kekes in 2002, and by Kwame Anthony Appiah in 2006, and Singer&#x27;s claim of a straight path from commonsense morality to great giving has also been disputed.

Singer&#x27;s article inspired the writing of Peter Unger&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;Living High and Letting Die&quot;.

Philosopher William MacAskill was influenced by the essay, which he encountered in an undergraduate seminar; MacAskill later went on to be a founder of the effective altruism movement. In 2015, &quot;The New Republic&quot; noted the influence of Singer&#x27;s essay on effective altruism.

The &quot;drowning child&quot; analogy informs the title of the 2015 book &quot;Strangers Drowning&quot; by Larissa MacFarquhar, which documents the lives of various extreme altruists, some of whom were influenced by Singer&#x27;s essay.

In a review for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; upon the release of the 2016 book version of Singer&#x27;s essay, Daniel Ben-Ami argued that the key to eradicating poverty lies not only in charitable efforts but also in fostering a sense of agency among the impoverished. He gave the example of how China lifted millions out of poverty by transforming its economy, rather than being dependent on western aid and sympathy. He argued that people who wish to aid famine relief or poverty alleviation should have the freedom to do so. However, it is important to avoid perceiving the impoverished as mere passive beneficiaries of Western charity. Such a perspective should be resisted, as it overlooks their agency and potential to contribute actively to their own betterment.

*&quot;[N]either our distance from a preventable evil nor the number of other people who, in respect to that evil, are in the same situation as we are, lessens our obligation to mitigate or prevent that evil.&quot;
* &quot;[I]f it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.&quot; This, according to Singer, is a qualified reassertion of the principle that governs his argument.
* &quot;People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief. (Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.) This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified. When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look &#x27;well-dressed&#x27; we are not providing for any important need.&quot;

<text>June Palmer (1 August 1940 – 6 January 2004), also known as &quot;June Power&quot;, was an English model and actress who, along with Pamela Green, was the most famous Harrison Marks glamour model of the 1960s. Palmer was featured in Harrison Marks&#x27;s publications &quot;Kamera&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot;, and in his short films that feature nudity.

==Career==
June Palmer was born on 1 August 1940 in London, England. In 1959, during her late teens, she began working as a topless dancer at the Windmill Theatre in London and started modelling professionally in the late 1950s. She appeared in 8mm glamour films made by George Harrison Marks, Russell Gay, Express Films and Arthur Howell. She later played minor parts in movies, including &quot;The Naked World of Harrison Marks&quot; (1966), &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1969), &quot;The Nine Ages of Nakedness&quot; (1969), &quot;Games That Lovers Play&quot; (1971) and &quot;On the Game&quot; (1974). Palmer stopped modelling for magazines in 1970 but continued to do some private modelling for London camera clubs until 1987.

Photographer Irv Carsten spoke about Palmer in the March 1962 issue of &quot;Modern Man&quot;: &quot;I felt ashamed using an automatic camera. Her posing is second nature, she&#x27;s beautiful from any angle, and without camera settings to make, there&#x27;s nothing to do but watch.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1964, at 24 years old, Palmer married the 44-year-old photographer-cum-stuntman Arthur Howell. In the 1960s, they started and ran Strobe Studios in Clapham, South London, a London County Council (LCC)-licensed model agency and photographic studio that was advertised in many photography magazines such as &quot;Practical Photography&quot;. Palmer divorced Howell in 2000 and later married again. She died on 6 January 2004.
