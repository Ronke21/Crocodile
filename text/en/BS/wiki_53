<text>Zenica ( ; ; ) is a city in Bosnia and Herzegovina and an administrative and economic center of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Zenica-Doboj Canton. It is located in the Bosna river valley, about north of Sarajevo. The city is known for its Ironworks Zenica factory but also as a significant university center. According to the 2013 census, the settlement of Zenica itself counts 70,553 citizens and the administrative area 110,663, making it the nation&#x27;s fourth-largest city.

The urban part of today&#x27;s city was formed in several phases, including Neolithic, Illyrian, the Roman Municipium of Bistua Nuova (2nd–4th century; old name of the city), with an early Christian dual basilica. Traces of an ancient settlement have been found here as well; villa rustica, thermae, a temple, and other buildings were also present. Earliest findings in the place date from the period 3000–2000 BC; they were found in the localities of Drivuša and Gradišće. Zenica&#x27;s current name was first mentioned in 1415. A medieval church has been unearthed in Zenica, as well as the Franciscan Monastery of St. Mary. The independence of Medieval Bosnia is directly connected to Zenica (Gradješa&#x27;s plate and abjuration act; Kulin ban&#x27;s time; Vranduk, a castle of the Bosnian kings; Janjići and &#x27;hižas&#x27; [homes] of Bosnian Church members; stećci, stone tombstone monuments, etc.) During Ottoman rule (1463–1878), Zenica became a Muslim town; at the end of the 17th century, Zenica had 2,000 citizens, mostly Muslims; Orthodox and Catholic Christians are mentioned again from the end of the 18th century, and Jews in the 19th century. Modern Zenica was mostly built in the Austro-Hungarian and Yugoslavian periods. The population rose rapidly during the 20th century, and from the Bosnian War until 2013, the city lost a quarter of its population. The municipality of Zenica became the City of Zenica in 2014.

The city is geographically located in the heart of Bosnia. The settled area is and of the city proper covers . Elevation is . The rivers Bosna, Lašva, Babina, and Kočeva flow through the settlement. A moderate continental climate prevails. The city has thirteen urban local settlements and it consists of a total of 81 rural settlements.

Zenica has nine national monuments. The football club Čelik is a landmark of the city, and it also has one of the tallest buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina—Lamela. Famous Zenicans include Semir Osmanagić, Anabela Basalo, Danis Tanović, Amar Jašarspahić Gile, Mladen Krstajić, Dejan Lovren, Mervana Jugić-Salkić, and Amel Tuka.

==Etymology==
There are several theories about the origins of name Zenica.

According to orally transmitted tradition, the city was named after the pupil of the eye (Ekavian – pupil). There is also a legend that Zenica&#x27;s name is derived from when Queen Katarina Kosača Kotromanić, who was leaving Bobovac during the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463, said &quot;My pupil is left behind!&quot; (). Because of its location in the center of Zenica field, the city is indeed analogous to the eye&#x27;s pupil.

The name of the city can also be derived from the word &quot;zenit&quot;, meaning zenith, because it is in the center of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==
The urban part of today&#x27;s Zenica formed through several phases, which chronologically include a Neolithic community, the Illyrian &#x27;gradina&#x27;, the Roman Municipium of &quot;&quot;, and a Christian era-community.

In the Bilimišće district, traces of ancient settlements have been found. In the outlying villages of Putovići and Tišina, where villa rustica dominate, thermae, a temple, and a series of other sites are also present.

===Prehistory===
The earliest findings in Zenica date from the period of 3000 to 2000 BC; they were found in the localities of Drivuša and Gradišće. Metal axes, arrows, ornamental fibulae, and ceramic remains were unearthed from the Orahovički stream near Nemila, Gračanica, Ravna, and other places.The Illyrians came to this region during the transition from the Bronze and the Iron Age (from the 6th to the 5th centuries BC). Their defensive buildings, &quot;gradinas&quot;, are the best known (the word is derived from the verb – to build).The urban part of today&#x27;s Zenica was already formed in the younger Stone Age—the Neolithic, and especially later, during the time of the Illyrians. Toponyms of their &quot;gradinas&quot; demonstrate this: Gradišće, Gračanica, Gradac. A specific locality, Gradina, in Kopilo village, indicates that Zenica and its surrounding areas hosted organized human life around 2000 BC. There is a weak question of the presence of the Illyrian Old-Balkan tribe of Daesitiates in the Zenica region. The Daesitiates are a result of ethno-social development of early human life in prehistory; the transition period from the Bronze to the Iron Age resulted with Daesitiates emerging at the Lašva–Drina river belt. The Daesitiates confronted the Romans in 34 BC; the Romans did not make a long-lasting triumph, and the Illyrians were defeated in the city of Arduba, which was burnt down in 6–9 A.C. This is how the royal city of Vranduk probably existed in the time of the Illyrians, under the name Arduba.

Recent () international archaeological research, conducted by the Vienna (), Zenica (Zenica museum), and students and scientists from Sarajevo, using modern technology, shows that settlements with people and animals existed near Zenica over 3,100 years ago. Skeletons of pigs, cattle, and goats were found in Kopilo, an elevated place (600 m a.s.l.), indicating a farming settlement. Two tombs (one with human bones and ceramics), two tumuli, and a completely new prehistorical settlement, &quot;Ravna gradina&quot;, were also found.

===Antiquity===
The Romans tried to conquer the region at the end of the 3rd century BC Bellum Batonianum and were present in the area from the 6th to the 9th centuries. They ruled continuously in many areas until close to the end of the 4th century (after Arduba&#x27;s fall).

Today&#x27;s area of Zenica had its peak in the first six centuries of the Common Era, when it included one the most important municipiums and centers of Christian dioceses in Bosnia: Bistua Nuova—seat of the Bistuenska diocese and the seat of Roman Christianity in the Bosnian area prior to the Slavs&#x27; arrival. Data suggesting that Bistua Nuova&#x27;s bishop Andrew (Andreas, Andrija) took part in and was a signer of Solin sinodas in 530 and 533 underlines its importance. Ancient tombstone monuments date from ancient Bistua Nuova, as well as remains of old Christian basilicas. In the urban settlement of Odmut and the rural settlements of Putovići and Tišina, archaeologists have found epigraphs that have led them to conclude that Bistua Nuova was in the Zenica area.

An important road towards Salona (Solin), Argentarium (Srebrenica), and Sirmium (Srijemska Mitrovica) also passed through Bistua Nuova.

Barbarian invasions from the north (mainly Germans at the end of the 3rd century, as well as Slavs later) forced Christianity to retreat from these areas. During the invasions, at the beginning of the 7th century, Bistua Nuova was destroyed, along with its basilica.
It is believed that the barbarian invasions destroyed a huge part of the ancient inheritance. Goths, Avars, and Slavs passed through this location. The Slavs came in the 6th and 7th centuries and inhabited the middle part of the Bosna river stream—where Zenica Field is located. They formed tribal communities and were organized into a tribal ruling unit called a &quot;župa&quot; (parish). After their invasions, almost one century was needed for the first Slavic countries to form.

===Medieval Bosnia===
The history of medieval Zenica is not well recorded. There is but a single item of evidence from 1244 about Croatian-Hungarian king Béla IV&#x27;s charter. According to the documents that have so far been studied, the city&#x27;s current name was first mentioned on 16 March 1436 (or 20 March 1436, annually celebrated as &quot;Zenica Day&quot;) and later—Zenica is mentioned in a series of documents related to the Republic of Ragusa (Republic of Dubrovačka). Among other Bosnian parishes, Bored parish, which includes &quot;Bilina poila&quot;, is mentioned in the charter. The place refers to one part of the town of Zenica, today known as Bilino polje. The same place is mentioned in another document, dated 8 April 1203; it records a group of Bogomil chiefs who renounced paternalism before Innocent III&#x27;s court chaplain John of Casamaris. Bogomilism&#x27;s presence in the Zenica area and its status as a seat of the Bogomil Church is supported not only by written documents but also by headstones that illuminate the church&#x27;s hierarchy.

In the Middle Ages, specifically in 1370, the settlement of Klopče was mentioned, as well as a family of that name. On 8 January 1404, the Bosnian bishop from Janjići sent dispatches to the Ragusan prince Vlaho Sorkočević. In the Zenica settlement of Varošište, a medieval church has been unearthed, as well as a Franciscan monastery to St. Mary, which was built by sculptor Ivan Hrelić, a student of Juraj Dalmatinac.

===Ottoman era===

Bosnia experienced Ottoman incursions starting in 1386. The first Ottoman entry into Zenica relates to their victory over Hungarian warriors near Doboj in 1415. Zenica has been mentioned under today&#x27;s name since that event. The first official record of the city&#x27;s name is in a document dated 16 March 1436, which relates to the invasion and robbery of Zachlumia by the Ottoman Duke Barak, who retreated towards Zenica and there received Ragusan money in the name of redemption. From the time of that event until the complete establishment of Ottomans rule in Bosnia in 1463, there is no mention of Zenica in relevant documents. For that reason, this era of the city&#x27;s history cannot be covered in detail.

After administrative changes introduced in the first years of the rule, Zenica became part of Brod kadiluk in the newly formed Sanjak of Bosnia. Nahya of Zenica was first mentioned in 1485. It bore that name until the end of the 18th century and later became Zenica srez.

During Ottoman rule (1463–1878), the change of direction in the main trade route in turn changed the city and, except for a short period when it was a seat of the Brod judge Qadii (until 1557), Zenica was a kasbah that included mosques, a madrasa, several mektebs, shadirvans, caravanserais, and other types of Islamic architecture.

In one description from 1697, Zenica had 2,000 citizens, the majority of them Muslim. At the end of the 18th century, Orthodox and Catholic Christians are mentioned again, as are Jews in the 19th century.

After the ruin and exodus following the intrusion of Eugene of Savoy in 1697, a time of stabilization began in Zenica.

===Austro-Hungarian era===
After the Berlin Congress, held in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was given the rights to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina; armed resistance to occupying troops soon arose. It is believed that Zenica, more precisely the Hadži Mazića house, was the place of negotiations between representatives of the Ottoman authorities in the Bosnian vilayet of Hafiz-pasha and the commander of the Austro-Hungarian occupying forces, General Filipović, on the conditions of a cessation of the conflict.

During this time, Zenica witnessed the construction of various types of economically significant infrastructure, including a railway from Bosanski Brod in 1879, a coal mine in 1880, a paper factory (1885), ironworks (1892), and a penitentiary (1886). In 1908, a power station was built, which enabled the introduction of electric public lighting. State schools were also opened, the first in 1885 and the second in 1910. Confessional schools also opened, both for Catholic and Orthodox churches, and lectures at these schools and at madrasas began to be conducted in the local language. Cultural societies were organized, such as the Croatian Singing Society, as well as hunting and mountaineering clubs. In 1910, the first cinema opened in Zenica.

===End of the 19th century; 20th century===

By the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, urbanization was underway and the number of citizens increased severalfold. According to the 1910 census, the town had a population of 7,215. This rapid growth was reflected by a construction boom: The Orthodox Church of the Nativity of Our Lady was erected in 1885, two Catholic churches went up in 1910, and a synagogue was built in 1903, not to mention hotels, schools, water-supply infrastructure, modern roads, etc.

After World War I, the Kingdom of SHS was formed, which in 1929 became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and included Bosnia and Herzegovina. The political, economic, and social life of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1918 to 1941 stagnated, though this situation changed slightly before the beginning of World War II, with investments in the city&#x27;s ironworks.

====Yugoslavia====
After Zenica&#x27;s liberation by partisans on 12 April 1945, today celebrated as Zenica Liberation Day,&lt;ref name=&quot;zenicainfo.ba/2019/04/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the city began to develop as an industrial center. It expanded and included the former villages of Bilino Polje, Klopče, and Radakovo. New apartment blocks were built to cater to the increasing number of coal miners and steelworkers. The town&#x27;s population in 1948 was only about 15,000 and by 1961, it had grown to over 30,000. In 1981, that number stood at over 63,000 and after the last Yugoslavian census, the town had over 96,000 citizens, a sixfold increase in population since the formation of Yugoslavia.

====Bosnian War====

One year before the outbreak of the Bosnian War, in 1991, Zenica became the seat of one of the first private and independent radio stations in Eastern Europe—Radio CD-CEMP. In the spring of 1993, the station&#x27;s owner, a journalist, won a Belgian accolade for independent journalism, &quot;The Pen of Peace&quot;.

The first official civilian victim of the Bosnian War in Zenica was a two-year-old Croat girl named Matea Jurić (29 July 1990 – 13 May 1992), who was killed by a gunshot during the blockade of the military barracks of the JNA in the urban settlement of Bilimišće. A memorial was erected in her honour.

On 19 April 1993, during the Croat–Bosniak War, sixteen civilians were killed and fifty injured when a HVO howitzer-fired grenade hit the central bazaar of Zenica. The grenade was shot from the village of Putićevo []. During this period, Zenica was isolated from the rest of the world for a year and a half. The city suffered significant losses from sniper fire, arson, hunger, and a lack of electricity.

Zenica&#x27;s populace changed much during the war, with the arrival of Muslims (today&#x27;s Bosniaks) from other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the departure of Serbs to areas under Serb control.

===21st century===
Zenica recovered from the war and has continued to make slow progress. The city was governed for twenty years by the majority-Bosniak and Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA), which was mired in corruption and inefficiency, causing parts of the city to lack public lighting, water supply, a functioning sewer system, and paved roads.

A drastic population decrease of approximately 26% can be seen between 1991 and 2013, with Zenica losing one quarter of its citizens, partly due to the war as well as unfavourable economic circumstances, prompting young and middle-aged residents to emigrate to other parts of Europe and the United States.

In 2014, Zenica—as well as other cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina—witnessed violent citizen protests. Various buildings were attacked and demolished, tens of people were taken to the hospital, and several officials resigned.
The same year, Zenica was recategorized from a municipality to a city.

In the 2016 Bosnian municipal elections, independent politician Fuad Kasumović became mayor of the city. During his three years in office, he accelerated development, focusing on areas that had been neglected up to that point: city lighting was introduced, water-supply and sewer systems were upgraded, roads were paved, and bicycle lanes were introduced on a large scale. In 2019, German company nextbike introduced their bike-sharing system to the city. Plans were made for a new municipal heating system in order to put an end to regular heat shutoffs during the coldest seasons. New Year&#x27;s concerts began to be held on the main square. The Serbian pop band Miligram inaugurated the event in 2017/18. Various other events have been organized, including the Zenica summer fest, music festivals, arts and crafts fairs, bazaars, and the like, thus improving the city&#x27;s economic outlook. Additionally, the issue of stray dogs in the urban core was handled, pollution was significantly reduced, public transport was improved, and the city is also planning to resolve the problem of unemployment and to modernize the education system, among other projects.

==Geography==
Zenica is located in the heart of Bosnia, in the central part of the river Bosna&#x27;s flow, after which the country is named. Its average elevation is above sea level.

===Topography and layout===
The topography of the city is that of a valley–basin. It is made up of a series of alluvial planins, hills, and mountain passes. The average altitude of the city itself, which is surrounded by hills, is . However, there are many higher positions, such as Tvrtkovac, a hiking destination, whose altitude is . The Zenica basin extends from the Lašva river canyon in the south to the Vranduk canyon and Vranduk gorge in the north—of an average length of and with an average altitude of . Overview of the highest hills and mountains is given in the table below.

The lowest topographical areas of Zenica are along the river Bosna. In both eastern and western directions, the altitudes increase and thus, the northwestern and northeastern areas of the city are the highest.

===Water===
Zenica is characterized by many small rivers and streams; all of them flow into the Bosna river basin.

The Bosna is the most important body of flowing water in the Zenica area. It springs from Ilidža, near Sarajevo, and flows into the river Sava, near Bosanski Šamac. Thus, the river has a natural south–north flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;zenica.ba fakta/o-gradu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a total length of , of the river is in the city, and most residences are built alongside it, as are roads and railways.

===Ecology===

Zenica&#x27;s industry has polluted and damaged the city&#x27;s environment. After the Bosnian War, its main polluter, the ironworks, was incapacitated. However, several years later, the old steelworks partially resumed operations, and a non-partisan citizen organisation called Eko pokret Zenica began to protest it, together with the local branch of the Greens of Bosnia and Herzegovina political party.&lt;ref name=&quot;slobodna-bosna.ba/vijest/6160&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babina river basin was declared a nature park after the group&#x27;s intercession. The city has also entertained initiatives to create a dam on the Vranduk. The Greens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Eko pokret have opposed this as well, declaring the Vranduk a national park.

Mošćanica, the regional waste landfill, is located between the villages of Mošćanica, Mutnica, Palinovići, Briznik, Arnauti, Ponihovo, and Plavčići, southeast of Zenica.

==Economy==
Zenica is an industrial center. The main types of industry in the city are iron and steel production, as well as coal mining. Extraction of brown coal in Zenica began in 1880 and production of steel in 1892.

In 1990, the municipality produced 1.4 million tons of steel, 924,000 tons of coal, of cloth, and 158,000 hL of milk, among other commodities. Employed workers numbered 49,415–53,419 in the civil sector and 4,004 in the private sector.

Even though the Bosnian War (1992–1995) did not cause as much destruction to Zenica as it did elsewhere, it damaged the economy. This is reflected in the interruption of steel processing and a decrease in its production.

Farming and cattle breeding are a significant component of the city&#x27;s economy, with potatoes, carrots, onions, corn, and wheat being the most commonly grown crops.

==Politics==

<doc id="548718" wikidata="Q1331046" url="?curid=548718" title="Monju Nuclear Power Plant">
<text>was a Japanese sodium-cooled fast reactor, located near the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant, Fukui Prefecture. Its name is a reference to Manjusri. Construction started in 1986 and the reactor achieved criticality for the first time in April 1994. The reactor has been inoperative for most of the time since it was originally built. It was last operated in 2010 and is now closed.

Monju was a sodium cooled, MOX-fueled, loop-type reactor with three primary coolant loops, designed to produce 280 MWe from 714 MWt. It had a breeding ratio of approximately 1.2.
The plant is located on a site that spans 1.08 km2 (267 acres), the buildings occupy 28,678 m2 (7 acres), and it has 104,680 m2 of floor space.

An accident in December 1995, in which a sodium leak caused a major fire, forced a shutdown. A subsequent scandal involving a cover-up of the scope of the accident delayed its restart until May 6, 2010, with renewed criticality reached on May 8, 2010. In August 2010 another accident, involving dropped machinery, shut down the reactor again. As of June 2011, the reactor had only generated electricity for one hour since its first testing two decades prior. As of the end of 2010, total funds spent on the reactor amounted to ¥1.08 trillion. An estimated ¥160–170 billion would be needed to continue to operate the reactor for another 10 years. As of 2014, the plant had cost ¥1 trillion ($9.8 billion).

A final decision on the project (e.g. to decommission or extend funding) was due by end 2016, and a decision to close the facility was made in December 2016. In December 2017 the Japan Atomic Energy Agency applied for approval of its decommissioning plan by the Nuclear Regulation Authority. Decommissioning and dismantling are planned to be completed by 2047 and is expected to cost ¥375 billion.

==History==
===1995 sodium leak and fire===
On December 8, 1995, the reactor suffered an accident rated level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). Intense vibration caused a thermowell inside a pipe carrying sodium coolant to break, possibly at a defective weld point, allowing several hundred kilograms of sodium to leak out onto the floor below the pipe. Upon contact with air, the liquid sodium reacted with oxygen and moisture in the air, filling the room with caustic fumes and producing temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius. The heat was so intense that it warped several steel structures in the room. An alarm sounded around 7:30 p.m., switching the system over to manual operations, but a full operational shutdown was not ordered until around 9:00 p.m., after the fumes were detected. When investigators located the source of the spill they found as much as three tons of solidified sodium.

The leak occurred in the plant&#x27;s secondary cooling system, so the sodium was not radioactive. However, there was massive public outrage in Japan when it was revealed that Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), the semi-governmental agency then in charge of Monju, had tried to cover up the extent of the accident and resulting damage. This coverup included falsifying reports and the editing of a videotape taken immediately after the accident, as well as issuing a gag order that aimed to stop employees revealing that tapes had been edited.

The official in charge of investigating the coverup, Shigeo Nishimura, committed suicide by leaping from the roof of a Tokyo hotel. Nishimura was deputy general manager of the general affairs department of the Power Reactor and the Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, the Government concern that ran the country&#x27;s prototype fast-breeder reactor. Officials said Nishimura was not involved in the cover-up but was distressed by evidence he had unearthed.

===2010 Restart===

On November 24, 2000, Japan Atomic Energy Agency announced their intention to restart the Monju reactor. This decision was met with resistance by the public, resulting in a series of court battles. On January 27, 2003, the Nagoya High Court&#x27;s Kanazawa branch made a ruling reversing its earlier 1983 approval to build the reactor, but then on May 30, 2005, Japan&#x27;s Supreme Court gave the green light to reopen the Monju reactor.

The nuclear fuel was replaced for the restart. The original fuel loaded was mixed plutonium-uranium oxide with plutonium content of around 15–20%, but by 2009, due to natural radioactive decay, the fuel had only half of the original plutonium-241 content. This made achieving criticality impossible, requiring fuel replacement.

The restart was scheduled for October 2008, having been moved back five months. A restart date of February 2009 was again delayed due to the discovery of holes in the reactor&#x27;s auxiliary building; in August 2009 it was announced that restart might be in February 2010.

In February 2010, JAEA obtained official approval to restart the reactor from the Japanese Government. The restart was definitely scheduled for the end of March. In late February, JAEA requested Fukui Prefecture and Tsuruga City for deliberations aimed at resuming test operation. Having obtained the go ahead from both entities, JAEA started criticality testing, after which it took some months before commercial operation could resume – as for any new nuclear plant.

Operators started withdrawing control rods on May 6, 2010, marking the restart of the plant. The Fukui Prefecture governor, Issei Nishikawa asked the METI for additional stimulus to the prefecture including an expansion of the Shinkansen in turn for the restart of the plant. Monju achieved criticality on May 8, at 10:36 AM JST. Test runs were to continue until 2013, at which point the reactor could have started to feed power into the electric grid, beginning &quot;full fledged&quot; operation.

===2010 &quot;In‐Vessel Transfer Machine&quot; falling accident===
On August 26, 2010, a 3.3-tonne &quot;In‐Vessel Transfer Machine&quot; fell into the reactor vessel when being removed after a scheduled fuel replacement operation.
On October 13, 2010, an unsuccessful attempt was made to retrieve the machine. The JAEA tried to recover the device used in fuel exchange but failed as it had become misshaped, preventing its retrieval through the upper lid.

The JAEA began preparatory engineering work on May 24, 2011 to set up equipment to be used to retrieve the IVTM that fell inside the vessel. The fallen device was successfully retrieved from the reactor vessel on June 23, 2011.

===2012 Sodium-heater failure===
On Sunday 2 June 2012 the sodium heater, which keeps the sodium molten as a secondary coolant, ceased operating for half an hour from about 4:30 p.m. The power supply was checked, but insufficient information in the service manual caused the heater to stop, causing a fall of about 40 C from 200 C of the sodium temperature. Under the internal rules of JAEA, the failure was regarded a too minor incident to report it to the authorities, but the next day the Nuclear Regulation Authority and local governments were informed about the incident. However it was not made public.

===2013 New Director of the JAEA appointed===
On 31 May 2013 science and technology minister Hakubun Shimomura announced that Shojiro Matsuura, (77 years) the former chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission, would be the next president of JAEA on Monday 3 June. In this function he would reorganize the JAEA, with safety as a top priority.

Former functions of Matsuura:
* November 1998 President, JAERI (After experience as Vice President)
* April 2000 Chairman, Nuclear Safety Commission
Present functions: 
* November 2012 Chairman, Japan Nuclear Safety Institute
* June 2013 President, Japan Atomic Energy Agency 

===Omitted safety inspections===
During safety inspections conducted by the NRA between 3 and 21 June 2013, it was revealed that the safety inspections on another 2,300 pieces of equipment had been omitted by JAEA. In 2014 more uninspected equipment was discovered, and more than 100 improper corrections to inspection records found, leading to concerns that inspection reports were being falsified. Again in 2015 it was discovered that regular degradation assessments measuring the thickness of sodium cooling pipes had not been carried out since 2007.

===Further incidents===
On 16 February 2012 NISA reported that a sodium-detector malfunctioned. About 3 p.m local time the alarm went off. Additionally, a ventilator that should cool a pipe stopped. According to NISA no leakage was found, and there was no damage to the environment. Repairs were planned.

On 30 April 2013 an operating error rendered two of the three emergency generators unusable. During the monthly testing of the emergency diesel generators, staff forgot to close six of the twelve valves they had opened before testing, releasing thick black smoke. JAERI reported it to the Nuclear Regulation Authority as a breach of security regulations.

On Monday 16 September 2013 before 3 a.m. the data transmission of the reactor stopped to the government&#x27;s Emergency Response Support System. Whether this was caused by Typhoon Man-yi, the powerful typhoon that went through Japan that day, was unknown. At that moment it was not possible to restore the connection, because the reactor site in Tsuruga was inaccessible due to mudslides and fallen trees caused by the typhoon.

On August 3, 2016, it was discovered that an alert triggered on November 19, 2015, when the quality of the water in a spent nuclear fuel rod pool deteriorated, was ignored until April 2016 and rectified only the next month.

==Developments since Fukushima-Daiichi accident in March 2011==

In September 2011 the ministry of education, science and technology asked for the fiscal year of 2012 only 20 to 30 percent of the budget to maintain and manage the Monju reactor for the year 2011. The uncertainty about Japan&#x27;s future energy policy caused the ministry to conclude that the project could not proceed.

The test run of the reactor, in which the reactor&#x27;s output would be raised to 40 percent of its capacity by the end of March 2012, was postponed on September 29, 2011, by the Japanese Government because the uncertainty over the future of nuclear energy. 
After the accident in Fukushima, the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan made a start with a review of Japan&#x27;s long term energy policy. An outline of this policy would be published within 12 months. On September 30, officials of the Science and Technology ministry explained their decision not to start the test run at meetings in the city of 
Tsuruga and Fukui Prefecture.

The local Fukui edition of the Asahi Shinbun reported on June 22, 2012 that the reactor would restart in July 2012.

After it was revealed in November 2012, that regular safety checks had been omitted, the Nuclear Regulation Authority ordered JAEA to change its maintenance rules and inspection plans. JAEA had failed to perform periodical safety checks on nearly 10,000 out of 39,000 pieces of equipment at the plant before the deadlines were met. Half May 2013 not all details were worked out, and under the rules set by the NRA, it was not allowed to change nuclear fuel rods or move the control rods. Therefore, the restart of the reactor was not permitted.

On 16 May 2013 the NRA ordered JAEA President Atsuyuki Suzuki to comply with their decisions and planned a meeting on 23 May to explain their reasoning, making it very likely that the NRA would block the reactivation of the reactor. In reaction to this Suzuki told reporters, &quot;It takes nearly one year for preparation and it is physically quite difficult (to restart the reactor before March 2013).&quot; Because the criticism of the NRA on the sloppy safety controls Atsuyuki Suzuki resigned as President of JAEC on 17 May. Although the resignation was accepted by the government, the move was a surprise, because on May 16 Susuki had spoken on a meeting in the Japanese parliament, the Diet, and to the NRA secretariat and had pleaded to restore the public&#x27;s trust in the JAEC. The NRA commented, that Suzuki&#x27;s resignation had not solved fundamental problems and that there was a need to restructure the JAEA as an organization.

Suzuki (born 1942) was an authority on the nuclear fuel cycle, and became President of the JAEA in August 2010. Before this he was a professor at the University of Tokyo and the chairman of the former Nuclear Safety Commission. Yonezo Tsujikura, vice president of the JAEA, served as acting president until a successor was chosen.

At the end of the fiscal year 2011, a budget of was requested to continue the Monju project. 
This money would cover the costs of maintenance and the costs of the test run, planned in the summer of 2012. 
On 20 November a seven-member Japanese government commission decided that the future of the Monju reactor should be thoroughly reviewed before a decision could be made for this 2012 budget. 
Some members of the commission thought that there would be little public support for restarting the fast breeder project, and that it was uncertain that the reactor could be taken into commercial service in 2050 as originally planned. 
Other members said that the Monju project should be stopped completely, and that all efforts should be put into the international fusion reactor project ITER instead. 
Decisions about the 2012 budget would be taken after the discussions in a panel of cabinet members about the nuclear policy of Japan, including the fast breeder reactor project, would be complete.

Reports in 2012 indicated that plans to generate electricity at Monju would be abandoned, and the plant repurposed into a research centre for handling spent nuclear fuel.

On 29 May 2013, the NRA announced that JAEA was prohibited from restarting the fast breeder reactor, describing the safety culture at the plant as &quot;deteriorated&quot;, because the problems at the plant were not addressed, and the staff were aware of the delayed inspections. The NRA said that before it could plan a restart of the reactor, JAEA must allocate appropriate funds and human resources to rebuild a maintenance and management system to prevent the recurrence of coolant leakages and other problems. The NRA also announced that an assessment would be made of whether geologic faults at the location of the Monju facility are active. It had similar plans for surveys at six facilities all over Japan.

On 2 March 2015 Noboru Hirose, a senior NRA official, told NHK at the beginning of a 3-week regular safety check that he could not say when test runs would be permitted to start. 
He would first need to examine how safety checks are conducted and whether adequate measures are in place to avoid a repeat of earlier problems.
JAEA had hoped the ban would be lifted by the end of March 2015.

==Seismic research in 2011, 2012 and 2013==
On 5 March 2012 a group of seismic researchers revealed the possibility of a 7.4M (or even more potent) earthquake under the Tsuruga Nuclear Powerplant. Before this date the Japanese governmental Earthquake Research Committee and Japan Atomic Power had calculated that the Urasoko fault under the plant, combined with other faults connected to it, was around 25 km long. and could cause a 7.2M quake and a 1.7 meter displacement. On top of this, the presence of the oceanic faults were not taken into account by NISA and JAP in the assessment of the safety of the Tsuruga nuclear power plant.

Analysis of sonic survey and other data provided by Japan Atomic Power analysed by a panel of experts of Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency showed the presence of multiple faults existing within 2 to 3 km from the Urasoko fault. According to Sugiyama, a member of this group of scientists, these faults were highly likely to be activated together, and this would extend the length of the Urasoko fault to 35 km.

Computer simulations calculating the length of a fault based on its displacement, showed the Urasoko fault to be 39 km long, a result close to the length estimated by the sonic survey data, and the fault could cause some 5 meter displacement when activated together with other faults.

Yuichi Sugiyama, the leader of this research group of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, warned that – as other faults on the south side of the Urasoko fault could become activated together – &quot;The worst case scenario should be taken into consideration&quot;

According to the experts there were many other faults located under one reactor on the west side of the Urasoku fault that could move also simultaneously. If this would be confirmed, the location of the Tsuruga nuclear plant would be disqualified.

On 6 March 2012 NISA asked Japan Atomic Power Co. to reassess the worst-case scenario for earthquakes at the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant. What damage this could do to the buildings on the site, because the Urazoko fault, running around 250 meters from the reactor buildings, could have a serious impact on the earthquake resistance of the power plant. NISA was also planning to send similar instructions to two other nuclear power plant operators in the Fukui area: Kansai Electric Power Company, and Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Because the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant and the Monju fast breeder reactor could also be affected by a possible earthquake caused by the Urazoko fault.

On 17 July 2013 a commission of five experts led by NRA commissioner Kunihiko Shimazaki started the investigations on the geological activity of 8 zones of crushed rock under the reactor. Whether these old faults could move in conjunction with the active fault situated half a kilometer from the reactor site, and would constitute a hazard for the reactor safety. One of the experts, Chiba University professor Takahiro Miyauchi, did not take part in the two-day survey, but would visit the site afterwards. On Thursday 18 July Kunihiko Shimazaki told reporters, that his team could not yet reach a conclusion, further research was needed. Another acoustic survey of the grounds was planned by Japan Atomic Energy Agency and a geological examination to determine the age of the clay and stones in the faults. This could take a couple of months to finish, The assessment was planned at the end of August 2013.

==Decommissioning plans==

On 21 October 2011 the Japanese government appointed a commission to study ways to cut wasteful expenditures, one possibility being decommissioning the Monju prototype fast breeder reactor. The Government Revitalization Unit took up this issue, because the calls to abolish this reactor were growing after the nuclear accident at Fukushima. As the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant made it difficult, if not impossible, to build new nuclear power plants, the government panel would also review subsidies for localities with atomic power plants as well as functions of related entities such as the Japan Atomic Energy Agency.

On 27 November, after a visit to the plant, nuclear disaster minister Goshi Hosono said that scrapping the Monju-fast-breeder reactor was an option that would be given serious thought. Politicians and private sector experts of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan made proposals for a thorough operational and budgetary review in the government&#x27;s energy policy screening session earlier in the week before his visit.

On 21 December 2016, the Japanese government confirmed the closure and decommissioning of the Monju reactor, with the suggestion that this would cost at least ¥375 billion.
The decommissioning of Monju is planned to take 30 years.
The Japanese regulator, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, accepted the plan in March 2018. The phases of the plan are:
#transfer spent fuel to on-site storage pool by 2022 (completed 13 October 2022)
#liquid sodium coolant extracted
#equipment dismantled
#reactor building demolished and removed by 2047

==Other FBR programs in Japan==
Despite its intention to close the Monju facility, the Cabinet appeared to reaffirm its commitment to a fast breeder program of some kind, essential if Japan&#x27;s stockpile of some 50 tonnes of plutonium is to be disposed of.

&quot;Jōyō&quot; is a test fast breeder reactor located in Ōarai, Ibaraki. The reactor was built in the 1970s for the purpose of experimental tests and the development of FBR technologies.

The successor to Monju was expected to be a larger demonstration plant to be completed around 2025, built by the newly formed Mitsubishi FBR Systems company. However, in 2014 Japan agreed to cooperate in developing the emergency reactor cooling system, and in a few other areas, with the French ASTRID demonstration sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor, which was subsequently cancelled in August 2019. As of 2016, France was seeking the full involvement of Japan in the ASTRID development.

<text>Pomerol (; ) is a commune in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine near Bordeaux in southwestern France.

==Wine==

With only , Pomerol is the smallest wine producing area in the Bordeaux region. It is more a community where the vineyards are family-shared. The mostly small-sized producers in the area produce red wines. As in the neighbouring appellation of Saint-Émilion, the predominant grape variety is Merlot, often with Cabernet Franc and smaller quantities of Cabernet Sauvignon. Unlike other Bordeaux regions, Pomerol has no official wine ranking or classification. However, wines like Château Pétrus and Château Le Pin are priced as high as the classified first growths of the Pauillac and Saint-Émilion such as Château Ausone and Château Cheval Blanc.

The next-door and slightly larger &quot;satellite&quot; appellation of Lalande-de-Pomerol produces similar wines which are shorter-lived and less expensive.

<text>The Royal Exhibition Building is a UNESCO World Heritage-listed building in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, built in 1879–1880 as part of the international exhibition movement, which presented over 50 exhibitions between 1851 and 1915 around the globe. The building sits on approximately , is long and is surrounded by four city streets. It is situated at 9 Nicholson Street in the Carlton Gardens, flanked by Victoria, Carlton and Rathdowne Streets, at the north-eastern edge of the central business district. It was built to host the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880–81, and then hosted the even larger Centennial International Exhibition in 1888. It was then chosen as the site for the Federation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The building is representative of the financial wealth and pride that the city of Melbourne and state of Victoria had in the 1870s. Throughout the 20th century smaller sections and wings of the building were subject to demolition and fire; however, the main building, known as the Great Hall, survived. 

On 1 October 1980, it was announced that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II had conferred the title of &quot;Royal&quot; to the Exhibition Building. It received restoration throughout the 1990s and in 2004 became the first building in Australia to be awarded UNESCO World Heritage status, being one of the last remaining major 19th-century exhibition buildings in the world. It is the world&#x27;s most complete surviving site from the International Exhibition movement 1851–1914. It sits adjacent to the Melbourne Museum and is the largest item in Museum Victoria&#x27;s collection. Today, the building hosts various exhibitions and other events and is closely tied with events at the Melbourne Museum.

==History==
The Royal Exhibition Building was designed by the architect Joseph Reed of Reed and Barnes architecture, who also designed the Melbourne Town Hall, the State Library of Victoria, and the Baroque style gardens. The Royal Exhibition Building was the largest design completed by Reed and Barnes. According to Reed, the eclectic design was inspired by many sources. Composed of brick, timber, steel, and slate, the Exhibition Building is representative of the Byzantine, Romanesque, Lombardic and Italian Renaissance styles.
The dome was modeled on the Florence Cathedral, while the main pavilions were influenced by the style of Rundbogenstil and several buildings from Normandy, Caen and Paris. The building has the scale of the French Beaux Arts, with a cruciform plan in the shape of a Latin cross, with long nave-like wings symmetrically placed east–west about the central dome, and a shorter wing to the north. The Great Hall is still in beautiful condition, crowned by an octagonal drum and dome rising 68 metres, and 18.3 metres across. The dome was formed using cast iron and timber frame and has a double shell. 
At the crossing, windows in the drum of the dome bring in sunlight for a bright open space. The interior is painted in the colour scheme of 1901, with murals and the words &quot;Victoria Welcomes All Nations&quot; under the dome surviving from 1888. In 1888, electric lighting was installed for the Centennial International Exhibition, making it one of the first in the world that was accessible during night time. The interior decorations changed between the two exhibitions of 1880 and 1888. In 1880, the walls were left bare and windows and door joinery coloured green. In 1888, walls were painted for the first time. The decoration was by interior designer John Ross Anderson.

It was built by David Mitchell, who also built Scots&#x27; Church and St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. He was also the father of the famed soprano Dame Nellie Melba, who sang at the opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. Mitchell was a member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural society and also the Builders and Contractor&#x27;s association.

The foundation stone was laid by Victorian governor George Bowen on 19 February 1879 and it was completed in just 18 months, opening on 1 October 1880, as the Melbourne International Exhibition. The building consisted of a Great Hall of over 12,000 square metres, flanking lower annexes to the north on the east and west sides, and many temporary galleries between.

===1880–1901===
In the 1880s, the building hosted two major International Exhibitions: The Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880 and the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888, celebrating a century of European settlement in Australia. The most significant event to occur in the Exhibition Building was the opening of the first Parliament of Australia on 9 May 1901, following the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January. After the official opening, the Federal Parliament moved to the Victorian State Parliament House, while the Victorian Parliament moved to the Exhibition Building for the next 26 years.

On 3 September 1901, the Countess of Hopetoun, wife of the Governor-General, announced the winners of a competition to design the Australian National Flag. A large flag, 5.5 metres by 11 metres, was unfurled and flown over the dome of the Royal Exhibition Building.

===1901–1979===
In 1902, the building hosted the Australian Federal International Exhibition and in 1907 the Australian Exhibition of Women&#x27;s Work. During the 1919 Spanish flu epidemic, the building was used as an influenza hospital.

As it decayed, it became known derogatively by locals as &quot;The White Elephant&quot; in the 1940s and by the 1950s, like many buildings in Melbourne of that time it was earmarked for replacement by office blocks. In 1948, members of the Melbourne City Council put this to the vote and it was narrowly decided not to demolish the building. The wing of the building which once housed Melbourne Aquarium burnt down in 1953. It was a venue for the 1956 Summer Olympics, hosting the basketball, weightlifting, wrestling, and the fencing part of the modern pentathlon competitions. During the 1940s and 1950s, the building remained a venue for regular weekly dances. Over some decades of this period it also held boat shows, car shows and other regular home and building industry shows. It was also used during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s for State High School Matriculation and for the Victorian Certificate of Education examinations, among its various other purposes. The western annexe was demolished in the 1970s. The last remaining original annex, the grand ballroom, was demolished amid controversy in 1979. It was replaced with a new building on the same footprint providing more exhibition space, clad in mirror glass, in 1980. On 1 October 1980 during a visit to Victoria, Princess Alexandra unveiled a plaque which commemorated both the opening of the new mirror-glass &quot;Centennial Hall&quot;, and the centenary of the building. She also unveiled a second plaque commemorating the bestowal of the title &quot;Royal&quot; on the building by Her Majesty the Queen.

===1980–present===
Following the outcry over the ballroom demolition, and the appointment of new Trustees and a new Chair in 1983, the heritage of the building began to be seen as important as providing modern space for exhibitions.

The first conservation assessment of the building was undertaken by Alan Willingham in 1987, and over the following decades the Great hall was progressively renovated and restored. In 1996, the then Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, proposed the location and construction of Melbourne&#x27;s State Museum in the carpark to the north, which involved the demolition of the 1960s annexes in 1997–98.

The biennial Melbourne Art Fair took place at the Royal Exhibition Building from 1988 to 2014.

The location of the Melbourne Museum close to the Exhibition Building site was strongly opposed by the Victorian State Labor Party, the Melbourne City Council and some in the local community. Due to the community campaign opposing the museum development, John Brumby, then State opposition leader, with the support of the Melbourne City Council, proposed the nomination of the Royal Exhibition Building for world heritage listing. The world heritage nomination did not progress until the election of the Victorian State Labor Party as the new government in 1999.

On 9 May 2001, the Royal Exhibition Building hosted a special joint sitting of the Australian Parliament. This was held in the same site as the opening of the first Parliament of Australia exactly 100 years earlier. This event commemorated the Centenary of that event specifically, and the Centenary of Federation more generally. The joint sitting was addressed by the Governor-General, Sir William Deane. A painting by artist Robert Hannaford was commissioned to capture this 2001 event, with his artwork echoing Tom Roberts&#x27; &quot;Big Picture&quot; that captured the 1901 opening.

On 1 July 2004, the Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens was granted listing as a World Heritage Site, the first building in Australia to be granted this status. The heritage listing states that &quot;The Royal Exhibition Building is the only major extant nineteenth-century exhibition building in Australia. It is one of the few major nineteenth-century exhibition buildings to survive worldwide.&quot; In October 2009, Museum Victoria embarked upon a major project to restore the former German Garden of the Western Forecourt. The area had been covered by asphalt in the 1950s for car parking.

===Renovations and the Dome Promenade===
In 2018, The Australian Government granted $20 million for heritage restoration works to protect and promote the Royal Exhibition Building. The Australian Department of Environment and Energy, along with Heritage Victoria, Creative Victoria and Museums Victoria oversaw the various internal and external projects that were all completed by 2022.  Externally, sections of the facade underwent conservation works.  Internally, renovations included restoring the timber flooring and some old staircases, which were replaced by much safer stairs made from concrete and steel.  The basement also underwent restoration works and has now been turned into a curatorial exhibition space with various items on display telling the history of the Royal Exhibition Building and Melbourne.

Due to the buildings age, heritage experts suggest further restoration works to the building are needed, both internally and externally.  The works are predicted to cost around 50 million dollars.  As of September 2024, no further funding has been allocated by the Australian Government or Victorian Government.

The Dome Promenade at the Royal Exhibition Building has a rich history as one of Melbourne’s most iconic tourist attractions. During the late 1800s, it was the go-to spot for visitors seeking panoramic views of the growing city and its new suburbs as there were very few other tall buildings to block the sweeping vistas in all directions. The promenade was particularly popular during the Melbourne International Exhibitions of 1880 and 1888.  For the 1888 Exhibition, over 100,000 people paid to enjoy the views. The promenade remained a central feature of Melbourne life until it was closed in the 1920s for structural repairs, which unfortunately never eventuated.  After being closed for nearly a century, the Dome Promenade was officially reopened on 28 October 2022, as part of the $20 Million heritage restoration works to the building. The first tour of the reopened Dome Promenade, available to the public ran on 29 October 2022. Museums Victoria are the custodians of the Royal Exhibition Building. Daily tours of the Dome Promenade can be booked on their website or at Melbourne Museum.

==Current use==
The Royal Exhibition Building is used to this day as an exhibition venue for various festivals and fairs such as Melbourne Fashion Festival, Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show and Brickvention. During the recent Covid-19 pandemic, the building was used as a mass vaccination centre, operated by St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

The Royal Exhibition Building is used as an exam hall for the University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne High School, Nossal High School, Mac.Robertson Girls&#x27; High School and Suzanne Cory High School.

The building is no longer Melbourne&#x27;s largest commercial exhibition centre. The modern alternative is the Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, which is in Southbank to the south of the Melbourne central business district.

<doc id="548722" wikidata="Q5107138" url="?curid=548722" title="Chris Knox">
<text>Chris Knox (born 2 September 1952) is a New Zealand rock and roll musician, cartoonist and movie reviewer who emerged during the punk rock era with his bands The Enemy and Toy Love. After Toy Love disbanded in the early 1980s, he formed the group Tall Dwarfs with guitarist Alec Bathgate. The Tall Dwarfs were noted for their unpolished sound and intense live shows. His 4-track machine was used to record most of the early Flying Nun singles.

He has also released a number of solo, self-produced albums which feature his Casiotone. Knox has also released an album under the pseudonym &#x27;Friend&#x27;.

==Career==
At the 2001 New Zealand Music Awards Knox&#x27;s ballad &quot;Not Given Lightly&quot; (1990) was announced as New Zealand&#x27;s thirteenth best song of all time, as voted by APRA members. A love song written for &quot;John and Liesha&#x27;s mother&quot;—his then-partner Barbara—this track never scaled commercial heights though it has belatedly generated some income for the songwriter through its use in TV advertising (notably for Vogel&#x27;s bread).

Knox has played live in front of audiences all around New Zealand, winning a reputation for his sometimes confrontational style, and performed annually at Wellington&#x27;s Bar Bodega. He has also extensively toured internationally. His swing through the US in 1995 included, among others, stops in Seattle to play the Crocodile Cafe. His minimalist, DIY sound played well to ears then-focused on grunge, with its retro-punk stylings.

A long-time resident of Auckland, Knox spent time as a newspaper columnist and film reviewer for Real Groove. In 1986-1987, he edited and published three issues of a New Zealand comics anthology &quot;Jesus on a Stick&quot;. Starting in 1987, his satirical comic strip &quot;Max Media&quot; appeared in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; every week until 2009. He has also been an occasional television film reviewer, hosted a Television New Zealand season of classic movies &#x27;The Vault&#x27;, and presented two seasons of arts series New Artland.

Knox launched his own label &#x27;A Major Records&#x27; in 2006 to release the album &quot;Chris Knox and the Nothing&quot;. This was the first album Knox recorded in a professional studio, rather than in his trademark DIY style, since his time with Toy Love.

Knox&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Love&quot;, from the 2000 album &quot;Beat&quot;, has been used in &quot;Share the Good&quot;, a Heineken Premium Light commercial directed by Todd Haynes and cinematographed by Edward Lachman.

In 2009 Knox was awarded a New Zealand Arts Foundation Arts Laureate Award.

On 11 June 2009 Knox was admitted to Auckland Hospital suffering from a stroke. The album &quot;&quot; was released in New Zealand on 16 November 2009. It features 33 artists performing Knox&#x27;s songs. The album is a way for Knox&#x27;s fans to contribute to the costs of his rehabilitation. All artists contributed their time and talent without charge. Artists include Jay Reatard, David Kilgour, The Mint Chicks, Shayne Carter, Yo La Tengo, Bonnie &#x27;Prince&#x27; Billy, Bill Callahan, The Mountain Goats, The Bats, The Chills, The Verlaines, Jeff Mangum, The Nothing (including Chris), Tall Dwarfs and Lou Barlow.

The Greenwich Village arts venue Le Poisson Rouge hosted a benefit concert for Knox on 6 May 2010. Artists included Jeff Mangum and Yo La Tengo, who both participated in the 2009 benefit album for Knox.

Since his stroke, Knox has done a very small number of live appearances, for instance at the presentation of &quot;Stroke – Songs For Chris Knox&quot; in November 2009, on 22 April 2012, on 29 September 2012 in Auckland, with Rackets, as Knoxious and in support of Neutral Milk Hotel on 23 and 24 of November, 2013.

<doc id="548725" wikidata="Q313048" url="?curid=548725" title="Bob Kane">
<text>Robert Kane ( Kahn ; October 24, 1915 – November 3, 1998) was an American comic book writer, animator and artist who created Batman and many early related characters for DC Comics. He was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1993 and into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996.

==Early life ==
Kahn was born in New York City. His parents, Augusta ( Tuchman) and Herman Kahn, an engraver, were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. A high school friend of fellow cartoonist and future Spirit creator Will Eisner, Robert Kahn graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and then legally changed his name to Robert Kane. He studied art at Cooper Union before joining the Max Fleischer Studio as a trainee animator in the year of 1934.

==Comics==
He entered the comics field two years later, in 1936, freelancing original material to editor Jerry Iger&#x27;s comic book &quot;Wow, What a Magazine!&quot;, including his first pencil and ink work on the serial &quot;Hiram Hick&quot;. The following year, Kane began to work at Iger&#x27;s subsequent studio, Eisner &amp; Iger, which was one of the first comic book &quot;packagers&quot; that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium during its late-1930s and 1940s Golden Age. Among his work there was the talking animal feature &quot;Peter Pupp&quot;—which belied its look with overtones of &quot;mystery and menace&quot;—published in the U.K. comic magazine &quot;Wags&quot; and reprinted in Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Jumbo Comics&quot;. Kane also produced work through Eisner &amp; Iger for two of the companies that would later merge to form DC Comics, including the humor features &quot;Ginger Snap&quot; in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;, &quot;Oscar the Gumshoe&quot; for &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, and &quot;Professor Doolittle&quot; for &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;. For that last title he went on to do his first adventure strip, &quot;Rusty and his Pals&quot;.

===Batman===
In early 1939, DC&#x27;s success with the seminal superhero Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; prompted editors to scramble for more such heroes. In response, Bob Kane conceived &quot;the Bat-Man.&quot; Kane said his influences for the character included actor Douglas Fairbanks&#x27;s film portrayal of the swashbuckler Zorro; Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s diagram of the ornithopter, a flying machine with huge bat-like wings; and the 1930 film &quot;The Bat Whispers&quot;, based on Mary Rinehart&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;The Circular Staircase&quot; (1908).
Bill Finger joined Bob Kane&#x27;s nascent studio in 1938. An aspiring writer and part-time shoe salesperson, he had met Kane at a party, and Kane later offered him a job ghost writing the strips &quot;Rusty&quot; and &quot;Clip Carson&quot;. He recalled that Kane
Finger said he offered such suggestions as giving the character a cowl and scalloped cape instead of wings; adding gloves; leaving the mask&#x27;s eyeholes blank to connote mystery; and removing the bright red sections of the original costume, suggesting instead a gray-and-black color scheme. Finger additionally said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom&quot;, a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was familiar as well. Finger, who said he also devised the character&#x27;s civilian name, Bruce Wayne, wrote the first Batman story, while Kane provided art. Kane, who had already submitted the proposal for Batman at DC and held a contract, is the only person given an official company credit for Batman&#x27;s creation. Comics historian Ron Goulart, in &quot;Comic Book Encyclopedia&quot;, refers to Batman as the &quot;creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger&quot;.

According to Kane, &quot;Bill Finger was a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning. He wrote most of the great stories and was influential in setting the style and genre other writers would emulate ... I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him. Bill turned him into a scientific detective.

The character debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939) and proved a breakout hit. Within a year, Kane hired art assistants Jerry Robinson (initially as an inker) and George Roussos (backgrounds artist and letterer). Though Robinson and Roussos worked out of Kane&#x27;s art studio in &quot;The New York Times&quot; building, Kane himself did all his drawing at home. Shortly afterward, when DC wanted more Batman stories than Kane&#x27;s studio could deliver, the company assigned Dick Sprang and other in-house pencilers as &quot;ghost artists&quot;, drawing uncredited under Kane&#x27;s supervision. Future &quot;Justice League&quot; writer Gardner Fox wrote some early scripts, including the two-part story &quot;The Monk&quot; that introduced some of The Batman&#x27;s first &quot;Bat-&quot; equipment.

In 1943, Kane left the Batman comic books to focus on penciling the daily &quot;Batman&quot; newspaper comic strip. DC Comics artists ghosting the comic-book stories now included Jack Burnley and Win Mortimer, with Robinson moving up as penciler and Fred Ray contributing some covers. After the strip finished in 1946, Kane returned to the comic books but, unknown to DC, had hired his own personal ghosts, including Lew Schwartz and Sheldon Moldoff from 1953 to 1967.

===Robin===
Bill Finger recalled that

Kane, who had previously created a sidekick for Peter Pupp, proposed adding a boy named Mercury who would have worn a &quot;super-costume&quot;. Robinson suggested a normal human, along with the name &quot;Robin&quot;, after Robin Hood books he had read during boyhood, and noting in a 2005 interview he had been inspired by one book&#x27;s N. C. Wyeth illustrations.

 The new character, an orphaned circus performer named Dick Grayson, came to live with Bruce Wayne as his young ward in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 (April 1940) and would inspire many similar sidekicks throughout the Golden Age of comic books.

===The Joker===
Batman&#x27;s nemesis the Joker was introduced near that same time, in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (Spring 1940). Credit for that character&#x27;s creation is disputed. Kane&#x27;s position is that

Robinson, whose original Joker playing card was on public display in the exhibition &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007, and the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia from October 24, 2004 to August 28, 2005, has countered that:

Robinson added, however, &quot;If you read the Batman historian [E. Nelson] Bridwell, he had one interview where he interviewed Bill Finger and he said no, the Joker was created by me—an acknowledgement. He can be credited and Bob himself, we all played a role in it. ... He wrote the script of that, so he really was co-creator, and Bob and I did the visuals, so Bob was also.&quot;

===Other characters===
According to comics historian Les Daniels, &quot;nearly everyone seems to agree that Two-Face was Kane&#x27;s brainchild exclusively&quot;. Catwoman, originally introduced by Kane with no costume as &quot;the Cat&quot;, was partially inspired by his cousin, Ruth Steel. Kane, a frequent moviegoer, mentioned that Jean Harlow was a model for the design and added that &quot;I always felt that women were feline&quot;. Kane created the Scarecrow and drew his first appearance, which was scripted by Finger. Kane also created the original incarnation of Clayface. According to Kane, he drew the Penguin after being inspired by the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes—a penguin with a top hat and cane. Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because &quot;stuffy English gentlemen&quot; reminded him of emperor penguins.

==Later life and career==
In 1966, Kane retired from DC Comics, choosing to focus on fine art. As Kane&#x27;s comic-book work tapered off in the 1960s, he parlayed his Batman status into minor celebrity. He enjoyed a post-comics career in television animation, creating the characters Courageous Cat and Cool McCool, and as a painter showed his work in art galleries, although some of these paintings were produced by ghost artists. DC Comics named Kane in 1985 as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;. In 1989, Kane published the autobiography &quot;Batman and Me&quot;, with an updated edition &quot;Batman and Me: The Saga Continues&quot;, in 1996.

Kane worked as a consultant on the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot; and its three sequels with directors Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher.

Stan Lee interviewed Kane in the documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kane married his first wife, Beverly, in the 1940s, and the two divorced in 1957. They had a daughter, Deborah. Kane married his second wife, actress Elizabeth Sanders Kane, in 1987.

==Death==

Kane died November 3, 1998, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, at age 83. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, California.

==Awards and honors==
Kane was a recipient of the Inkpot Award in 1977, was inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996. He was added to the National Comics Awards&#x27; Roll of Honour in 1999.

On October 21, 2015, for his work in motion pictures, he posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6764 Hollywood Boulevard.

Kane&#x27;s work is housed in collections in New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and St. John&#x27;s University.

<text>No-Do is the colloquial name for Noticiario y Documentales (&quot;News and Documentaries&quot;), a state-controlled series of cinema newsreels produced in Spain from 1943 to 1981 and closely associated with the 1939–1975 Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorial regime.

In their heyday, the No-Do newsreels predictably contained a good deal of propaganda and effervescent reporting in favour of the Francoist State. They were a way in which Franco could have a monopoly over the news and supply public information, censorship and propaganda for the formation of public opinion favorable to the Spanish State.

The No-Do newsreels, tainted by their indelible association with the Francoist State, fell out of favour within a few years of Spain&#x27;s transition to democratic government after Franco&#x27;s death. The last No-Do was produced in 1981 prior to the operation&#x27;s absorption into RTVE, Spain&#x27;s state-controlled television and radio broadcaster.
The No-Do archive is an important asset of RTVE and is often mined for nostalgia programmes.

In December 2012, the interactive media of RTVE digitized and launched the complete No-Do on the RTVE website, being able to be accessed for the first time by users around the world and not only by researchers. There are only five lost newsreels.

<text>Maine Road was a football stadium in Moss Side, Manchester, England, that was home to Manchester City from 1923 to 2003. It hosted FA Cup semi-finals, the Charity Shield, a League Cup final and England matches. Maine Road&#x27;s highest attendance of 84,569 was set in 1934 at an FA Cup sixth round match between Manchester City and Stoke City, a record for an English club ground.

At the time of its closure in 2003, Maine Road was an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 35,150 and of haphazard design with stands of varying heights due to the ground being renovated several times over its 80-year history. The following season Manchester City moved to the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, a mile from the city centre and near Ardwick, where the club originally formed in 1880.

==History==

===Decision to move===
Plans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922, following a decision by Manchester City to leave their Hyde Road ground, which did not have room for expansion and its main stand had been severely damaged by fire in 1920.

Two sites in Belle Vue in east Manchester were suggested, but neither was deemed sufficient. To many City fans east Manchester was regarded as City&#x27;s home and a move to Belle Vue seemed right. But the site was just and an available lease of fifty years was deemed too short by the club, so it was decided that City would move to Moss Side. The move to a larger stadium at Maine Road was backed by then manager Ernest Mangnall.

Many were disappointed when a site in south Manchester was chosen. A City director, John Ayrton, resigned from the board later in the decade and helped to form a breakaway club, Manchester Central, which played at Belle Vue.

===Construction===
A 16.25 acre former brickworks on Maine Road was purchased for £5,500. The road was originally known as Dog Kennel Lane but renamed Maine Road (after the Maine law) during the 1870s at the insistence of the Temperance movement which owned land on Dog Kennel Lane and the local authority accepted its request.

During construction, the stadium was reputedly cursed by a Gypsy when officials evicted a Gypsy camp from the area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. However, the Gypsy curse is likely to be an urban myth, as such stories are endemic to a number of Football League grounds. Construction took 300 days at a total cost of £100,000. The initial layout of the ground consisted of one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10,000, and uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.

===Early years and record attendance===

The first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923 when 58,159 fans watched Manchester City beat Sheffield United 2–1. The first changes to the ground took place in 1931, when the corner between the Main Stand and the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof. This renovation was the first of many, as Maine Road&#x27;s layout and capacity was varied throughout its lifespan.

In 1934, the highest attendance for an English football club playing at their own stadium was recorded at Maine Road, when 84,569 fans watched Manchester City play Stoke City in the sixth round of the FA Cup on 3 March 1934. (A larger crowd of 121,919 attended the Crystal Palace ground when it hosted the 1913 FA Cup Final between Aston Villa and Sunderland.) Queues formed four hours before the match, and one journalist stated that Maine Road was packed two hours before kick-off. A decision was taken to close the turnstiles with an attendance at approximately 85,000, 3000 short of what was thought to be the maximum capacity. Supporters witnessed a visiting Stoke team which included Stanley Matthews and City&#x27;s team boasted players Frank Swift, Fred Tilson, Sam Cowan and Matt Busby. The match was won 1–0 by Manchester City. This is the record home attendance for a domestic match and the record home attendance at a club ground, as the 1913 FA Cup final was played at a neutral venue.

Changes at the Platt Lane end took place in 1935, extending the terracing and providing a roof for the full stand. This marked the peak capacity of the ground, estimated at 88,000. Further changes were planned, but suspended when Manchester City were relegated from the First Division in 1938 and abandoned when World War II broke out.

===Post Second World War===
The stadium was shared by Manchester United after the Second World War as Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford ground had been damaged during the Manchester Blitz. United paid City £5,000 per season, plus a share of gate receipts. The highest attendance for a league game at Maine Road occurred during this period, when 83,260 people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on 17 January 1948. This figure is a national record for a league game. Maine Road was also used by Manchester United to host three of their four home games in the 1956–57 European Cup, until floodlights were installed at Old Trafford as required by UEFA.

===1950s to 1980s===
Floodlights for the stadium were installed in 1953 and further development took place in 1957. This was prompted by the hosting of two FA Cup semi-finals in successive years, the side facing the Main Stand (which until that time was generally known as the Popular Side) was redeveloped and named The Kippax after a nearby street. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Kippax became the part of the ground where the club&#x27;s most vociferous fans congregated. In 1963, benches were installed at the Platt Lane end, meaning that Maine Road had more seats than any other English club ground at the time. The next major redevelopment came in the 1970s, with the construction of the North Stand, a cantilevered stand which remained in place until the ground&#x27;s closure. The 1980s saw ambitious plans for improvements: however, these plans were shelved due to financial pressures after the Main Stand roof had been replaced at a cost of £1 million.
===Modernisation===
By 1990, some areas of the ground were becoming outdated, and there was the need for the stadium to become all-seater following the outcome of the Taylor Report in January that year, and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992. Its place was taken by the all-seater Umbro Stand that also incorporated executive boxes and was opened in March 1993. The name reverted to the Platt Lane Stand in 1997, when Kappa replaced Umbro as City&#x27;s kit suppliers.

The era of standing accommodation at Maine Road came to an end in May 1994 as the stadium became all-seater to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report, with the demolition of the Kippax Street Terrace, which, unusually for an all-standing area, was located at the side of the pitch instead of behind the goals. The final match with standing permitted took place on 30 April 1994, against Chelsea for a 2–2 draw. Immediately before demolition, the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18,300. A three-tier stand was built in its place, holding nearly 14,000 spectators, and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country, built at a cost of £16 million, four times the turnover of the club, according to then-chairman Francis Lee. The revamp of the Kippax was the second phase of a five-part development plan that would have cost £40million and increased the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 45,024. However, the club abandoned these plans as City were relegated from the Premier League in 1996 and from Division One two years later.

The new stand was an impressive modern facility, but it also emphasised the haphazard nature in which the ground had been redeveloped, as all four sides were of differing heights and construction styles. There were further plans for expansion that would have taken the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 45,000, but these were put on hold following City&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in 1996.

===Final match and move to City of Manchester Stadium===
There were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to an all-seated 45,000, but these were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

The final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003 with a Premiership match against Southampton. Tickets were sold upwards of £250 and a crowd of 34,957, about 100 short of maximum capacity, filled Maine Road for the final day. City lost the match 1–0 with Michael Svensson scoring the stadium&#x27;s last goal. The final match was followed by performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves.

City&#x27;s final goal at the stadium was scored on 21 April 2003 by Marc-Vivien Foé during a 3–0 victory over Sunderland. Sixty-six days later, Fóe died on 26 June from an undetected heart condition while representing the Cameroon national football team during the 2003 Confederations Cup.

An auction of the ground&#x27;s fixtures and fittings took place in July 2003, raising £100,000, which was donated to community projects in the Moss Side area, which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process. The two penalty spots and the centre spot were thought to be the most desired mementos, but all three had been cut out from the grass before the auction took place. The auction lasted for seven hours and 1,000 supporters attended the auction, with interest from clubs such as Preston North End and Norwich City for the bigger lots which could be reused.

===Redevelopment plans===

Towards the end of Maine Road&#x27;s lifespan there were proposals for other sports teams to make use of the stadium following City&#x27;s relocation; Stockport County once expressed interest in moving there from Edgeley Park, and in December 2000 Sale Sharks rugby union club was offered a lease for the stadium. However, none of the proposals came to fruition and some past City players stated their dismay at the stadium not being renovated for a mixed-use sports stadium. Demolition began in late 2003, lasting around 10 months.

Two years later approval was given for a new housing development to be built on the site, consisting of 474 homes.
There is a public art display commemorating the stadium and features a circular plate half open, symbolising the centre spot and the new emerging development which now sits on the Maine Road stadium.

==Pitch==
For long periods of its history Maine Road had the widest pitch in England. However, the width was changed several times by managers wishing to alter the pitch size to suit their style of play. In the final season before the ground was closed, the pitch size was 107 x 71 metres (116.5 x 78 yards). Maine Road&#x27;s replacement, the City of Manchester Stadium, has maintained this tradition of having a large pitch.

==Other uses==
Maine Road hosted two England internationals, the first was a 3–0 defeat of Wales on 13 November 1946 and the second a 9–2 win over Northern Ireland on 16 November 1949, England&#x27;s first ever World Cup qualifier. In addition, a number of wartime internationals were held at the ground. Maine Road was also the venue for a number of rugby league matches, hosting the Rugby Football League Championship Final eleven times between 1938 and 1956. It also hosted the rugby league match of the cross code challenge between Wigan Rugby League and Bath rugby union.

Maine Road hosted Manchester United&#x27;s first three home games of the 1956–57 European Cup, as Old Trafford did not have floodlights installed and so was deemed unsuitable to host matches in the tournament. The first European match at the ground saw United thrash Belgian champions RSC Anderlecht 10–0 in the preliminary round, a competition record which stood for seventeen years.

It hosted many FA Cup semi-finals, the last being in April 1994 when Manchester United beat Oldham Athletic 4–1 in a replay. It hosted the 1984 Football League Cup final replay, which Liverpool won 1–0 against Everton.

The stadium was used for several scenes in the 1948 motion picture &quot;Cup-tie Honeymoon&quot;. In later years, it was featured in the 2000 film &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Jimmy Grimble&quot; and the 2003 ITV drama &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, which starred Christopher Eccleston.

The stadium hosted concerts by many famous artists, including Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, David Cassidy, Dire Straits, Faith No More, Fleetwood Mac, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Jean Michel Jarre, Motörhead, The New Power Generation, Oasis, Pink Floyd, Prince, Queen, Soundgarden, The Rolling Stones, Simple Minds and Mavis Staples, among others. The most high-profile concert held at Maine Road was that of Mancunian band Oasis (themselves avowed Manchester City fans) in April 1996, a performance which was later released as a video, &quot;...There and Then&quot;.

In June 1961, the American Christian evangelist Billy Graham attracted over 100,000 people to the stadium, over the course of four nights, as part of his UK tour.

==Maine Road Football Club==
Maine Road also gives its name to a non-league football club, Maine Road FC. The club, who currently play in the North West Counties Football League Division One, was founded by a group of Manchester City supporters in 1955. The club previously based its headquarters at the social club adjoining Maine Road.

<doc id="548730" wikidata="Q333799" url="?curid=548730" title="Regalianus">
<text>P. C. Regalianus (died 260/261), also known as Regalian, was Roman usurper for a few months in 260 and/or 261, during the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of intense political instability in the Roman Empire. Regalianus was acclaimed emperor by the troops along the Danube river, a region of the empire that frequently experienced barbarian raids, probably in the hope that he might be able to secure the frontier.

Accounts by surviving literary sources concerning Regalianus are brief and few in number, and are mostly considered unreliable. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; relates that he was of Dacian descent, and a descendant of the Dacian king Decebalus, but this is mostly rejected in modern scholarship. Regalianus was married to Sulpicia Dryantilla, a woman from a prestigious senatorial family, which instead points to Regalianus also being of high-ranking Roman descent. Regalianus&#x27; acclamation as emperor was in the wake of a previous usurpation attempt by Ingenuus, also proclaimed by the Danube troops, that had been defeated by emperor Gallienus (253–268). Unlike Ingenuus, and revolutionary for an imperial claimant, Regalianus founded his own mint at Carnuntum, his seat of power. He minted coins of himself and his wife, though they were typically of poor quality.

Regalianus&#x27; local usurpation of power was beneficial for Gallienus, as it allowed the emperor to focus his attention on defending Italy from an invasion by the Alemanni while Regalianus was occupied fighting the barbarians in Illyria. After a brief &quot;rule&quot; of several months at Carnuntum, Regalianus was killed. How exactly he met his end is not entirely clear, but the most commonly accepted theory is that he died during a raid of Carnuntum by the Roxolani, possibly aided by a contingent of his men who had grown to oppose him.

== Background ==

Very little of Regalianus&#x27; life and career is recorded in surviving literary sources. The often unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a late Roman collection of imperial biographies, records that Regalianus was of Dacian origin, and a descendant of Decebalus, the king of Dacia who had been defeated with great effort by emperor Trajan in 105–107. This story is unlikely to be true, and it is more likely that Regalianus was a Roman of senatorial rank, given that he was married to Sulpicia Dryantilla, a woman of a prestigious senatorial family. The full name of Regalianus, P. C. Regalianus, only appears on his coinage, with literary sources referring to him only as Regalianus. Some ancient historians even got this name wrong: Eutropius (late fourth century) called him &#x27;Trebellianus&#x27; and Aurelius Victor (also late fourth century) called him &#x27;Regillianus&#x27;, &#x27;Religilianus&#x27; and &#x27;Religianus&#x27;. Aurelius Victor&#x27;s misspellings might reflect deliberate distortion or the pronunciation of his name in Vulgar Latin.

Given the scarcity of the source material, Regalianus&#x27; full name cannot be ascertained beyond the abbreviated two first names. It is possible that the P stands for the &quot;praenomen&quot; Publius. The C might stand for the &quot;nomen&quot; Cassius, given that Regalianus could be related to the earlier suffect consul C. Cassius Regallianus, Cornelius or Claudius, but it has also been suggested to stand for a second &quot;praenomen&quot; Gaius (which was traditionally shorted archaically as &quot;C.&quot; for &quot;Caius&quot; as it was originally spelled). Charles Theodore Beauvais de Preau believed based on engravings of coins by Hendrick Goltzius that his named was &quot;Quintus Nonius Regillianus&quot; but Joseph Hilarius von Eckhel thought that they instead belonged to some other Princeps and that the coins were the result of ignorant moneyers who failed to make legible coins, John Yonge Akerman noted that the standard of the cross described to be on the mint makes dates them to a later period, his opinion was that this supposed &quot;Nonius&quot; would have been a usurper during the reign of Constantius II.

== Career ==

The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; states that Regalianus was a military commander, &quot;dux&quot;, in Illyricum, promoted to this post by emperor Valerian (253–260) but also that he was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Moesia, a neighbouring region. This information cannot be regarded as reliable, especially given that it is anachronistic: the position of &quot;dux Illyrici&quot; did not yet exist at the time of Regalianus. Given his wife&#x27;s high rank, it is more likely that Regalianus was a provincial governor, perhaps of Pannonia Superior. These provinces along the Danube suffered from frequent barbarian raids, which often left them at odds with the central imperial government. Shortly prior to Regalianus&#x27; own claim to imperial power, the usurper Ingenuus had been proclaimed in the region in 260, but he had quickly been defeated by the reigning emperor, Gallienus (253–268). It is not clear how much time transpired between the revolt of Ingenuus and Regalianus&#x27; own acclamation, or if Regalianus was involved in the preceding revolt, though most scholars agree that there was an extended hiatus between them. This makes it unclear when exactly Regalianus was acclaimed emperor and also, given that he held out for several months, when he died. He was proclaimed emperor either late in 260 or in 261, and his claim to imperial power ended with his defeat and death after several months, either in 260 or 261.

After defeating Ingenuus, Gallienus had spent some time reorganising the defenses along the Danube, but had to return to Italy to deal with an invasion by the Alemanni, a Germanic tribe. Shortly after he departed, the Roxolani, a Sarmatian tribe that Gallienus had re-settled within the imperial borders in the Danube region, rebelled and attacked Regalianus&#x27; forces, whereafter Regalianus retreated to the city of Carnuntum. It was only after these events that Regalianus was acclaimed emperor by his troops. It is likely that the legionaries of Legio XIV Gemina, which was stationed at Carnuntum, supported the accession of Regalianus as they hoped he could help secure the Danube border.

Unlike Ingenuus before him, Regalianus minted his own coins at a mint he himself established at Carnuntum, a revolutionary move for an imperial claimant. In addition to his own portrait, Regalianus&#x27; coins also depict his wife, whom he raised to the rank of &quot;Augusta&quot; to bolster his position. Most, but not all, of Regalianus&#x27; coins have the formula &quot;AUGG&quot;. (implying two rulers, rather than &quot;AUG&quot;., which implies one) as part of their reverse legend. The plural &quot;AUGG&quot;. was likely intentional, but the intended meaning is not clear. It is more likely that it refers to the partnership between Regalianus and his wife Dryantilla, rather than to some partnership between Regalianus and Gallienus. Paul Pearson has speculated instead that the two might have had a son whom they promoted to co-Augustus. Regalianus&#x27; acclamation as emperor and later governance in the Danube region was actually beneficial to Gallienus, as it provided the invading Roxolani with a new focus for opposition and allowed Gallienus time to deal with the immediate threat presented by the Alemanni invasion in Italy. All of Regalianus&#x27; coins were minted at Carnuntum, and they are all overstruck issues, struck on coins minted by earlier emperors of the third century, such as Septimius Severus and Maximinus Thrax. Stylistically, Regalianus&#x27; coins imitate the coins of the Licinian emperors (Valerian and Gallienus), though they are of lower quality, often in a very rough style and with spelling errors. Some of the coins were so hastily made that the legends of the prior emperor who originally minted the coin is still partially visible, or that the new minting failed to give the coin a visible legend at all. Owing to his brief rule, only a small number of coins (just over 130) minted by Regalianus have been found. Most of them are today in private coin collections.

How Regalianus was defeated and died is unclear, given that different sources give different answers. The generally accepted theory concerning Regalianus&#x27; demise, forwarded by the Hungarian archaeologist Jenő Fitz in 1966, is that Regalianus was killed in a raid by the Roxolani, perhaps working together with some of his own men, after bravely having fought the rebelling tribe for some time. Other accounts include that Regalianus was murdered exclusively by his own troops as the Illyrian provincial population were afraid of retribution from Gallienus (&quot;Historia Augusta&quot;) or that he was defeated and killed by Gallienus (Eutropius).

<text>Vicki Sue Robinson (May 31, 1954 – April 27, 2000) was an American singer closely associated with the disco era of late 1970s pop music; she is most famous for her 1976 hit, &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Harlem, New York, to African American Shakespearean actor Bill Robinson and his European American wife Marianne, a folk singer, Vicki Sue Robinson was reared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for most of her early years. She returned to New York City with her family when she was a teen.

==Career==
She gave her first public performance in 1960 at the age of six, when she accompanied her mother on stage at the Philadelphia Folk Festival. Ten years later, at the age of 16, while a student at the New Lincoln School, Robinson made her professional performing debut when she joined the Broadway cast of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. Robinson remained with &quot;Hair&quot; for six weeks before moving to a new Broadway production, &quot;Soon&quot;, whose cast included Peter Allen, Barry Bostwick, Nell Carter, and Richard Gere.

After the show&#x27;s short run, Robinson appeared in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Long Time Coming, Long Time Gone&quot;, in which she and Richard Gere played Mimi and Richard Fariña. &quot;New York&quot; magazine opined that Robinson &quot;sings with gentle power, accompanying herself on guitar and dulcimer, and moves with astounding confidence.&quot;

Robinson also had bit parts in the films &quot;Going Home&quot; (1971) and &quot;To Find A Man&quot; (1972). After a sojourn in Japan, Robinson returned to Broadway in 1973, joining the cast of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

Robinson made her recording debut as one of several &quot;Hair&quot; veterans invited to sing background on Todd Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; album released in 1972. In 1973 she spent time in Japan with Itsuro Shimoda, with whom she did session work on his album &quot;Love Songs and Lamentations&quot;, and toured nationally.

In 2011, Gold Legion.com digitally remastered and reissued Robinson&#x27;s four albums for RCA Records on CD, along with bonus tracks and liner notes.

===&quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;===
In 1975, Robinson was providing vocals at a New York recording session for the album &quot;Many Sunny Places&quot; by Scott Fagan, a singer with whom she had performed in Greenwich Village clubs. Warren Schatz, a producer/engineer with RCA Records, was struck by Robinson&#x27;s voice and saw her potential as a disco-oriented artist. Schatz invited Robinson to cut some demos including a remake of the Foundations&#x27; &quot;Baby Now That I&#x27;ve Found You&quot;, which became Robinson&#x27;s first solo release. Despite that track&#x27;s failure, RCA green-lit Schatz producing Robinson&#x27;s debut album &quot;Never Gonna Let You Go&quot;. The title cut, a Schatz original, became a #10 disco hit but another album track, &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;, began to build &quot;buzz&quot; and was expediently released as a single, topping the disco charts on March 20, 1976. It reached the U.S. top 10 in August, spending around six months overall on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and propelling the &quot;Never Gonna Let You Go&quot; album to #49. &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot; would chart internationally, reaching #14 in Canada, #11 in the Netherlands, and #12 in South Africa. The track would earn Robinson a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

In 1976, Robinson toured across the United States promoting her hit tune, &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;. She performed on major TV shows such as &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;Mike Douglas&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and &quot;Soul Train&quot;. She also performed at the top venues around the country, such as the Boarding House in San Francisco, The Starwood, in Los Angeles, The Bottom Line, Felt Forum, and Carnegie Hall in New York. The original touring band consisted of Dan Pickering on trumpet and flute, Bill Cerulli on drums, Wendy Simmons on bass guitar, Nacho Mena on percussion, Vernie &quot;Butch&quot; Taylor on guitar, and George Pavlis on keyboards. George Pavlis later would be replaced by Joey Melotti on keyboards. The touring band members recorded four tracks on Robinson&#x27;s second album, &quot;Vicki Sue Robinson.&quot;

===Follow-up===
Again with Schatz producing, Robinson recorded &quot;Vicki Sue Robinson&quot; for release in the fall of 1976. Although its lead single, a cover of Bobby Womack&#x27;s &quot;Daylight&quot;, was only a minor hit (#61), the album reached #45. Robinson&#x27;s next Hot 100 appearance was in August 1977, with her version of David Gates&#x27; &quot;Hold Tight&quot;, which peaked at #67 (and #2 on the disco chart). Its parent album, &quot;Half and Half&quot;, again produced by Schatz, was not released until 1978 and peaked at #110. In 1979, Robinson contributed the track &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot; to the Schatz production &quot;Disco Spectacular&quot; – an album of dance versions of songs from the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, inspired by the release of the film version – and recorded what would prove to be her final album, &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;. Although Schatz was credited as the album&#x27;s executive producer, that job was done by Evelyn King&#x27;s producer, T. Life. &quot;Movin&#x27; On&#x27;s&quot; tracks were ignored in the dance clubs, but Robinson scored a 1979 club hit with &quot;Nighttime Fantasy&quot;, a track written and produced by Norman Bergen and Reid Whitelaw, recorded for the film &quot;&quot;. Also in 1979, Robinson appeared in a film made by the same production company as &quot;Nocturna: Granddaughter of Dracula&quot; titled &quot;Gangsters&quot; (now called &quot;Hoodlums&quot;), which also featured T. Life and Cissy Houston, and the first credited screen role for Jean Smart.

===The 1980s===
In 1980 Robinson moved from RCA to Ariola Records, where Warren Schatz had assumed the position of COO. However, Schatz did not continue as Robinson&#x27;s producer at Ariola. Respecting her wishes to move in a new musical direction, he had her record at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios with Clayton Ivey and Terry Woodford, producing the single &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Heartache&quot;, the recording of the Michael McDonald composition being Robinson&#x27;s sole Ariola release. She subsequently resumed recording dance music with Schatz, with releases on a number of labels: Prelude, Promise, Perfect, and Profile, with the Profile releasing her dance version of &quot;To Sir with Love&quot;, which became a surprise top ten hit in Australia in 1984. Robinson&#x27;s next release, a remake of &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; in 1984, was her last recording for almost fifteen years, apart from the track &quot;Grab Them Cakes&quot;, a duet with professional wrestler Junkyard Dog featured on &quot;The Wrestling Album&quot; (1985). &quot;Grab Them Cakes&quot; was issued as a single, with Cyndi Lauper miming the guitar in the music video.

Robinson sang background on Irene Cara&#x27;s hit single &quot;Fame&quot; in 1980, and as the decade progressed she returned to session work, backing Michael Bolton and Cher. She also established herself as a career jingle singer for such products as Wrigley&#x27;s Doublemint chewing gum, Maybelline Cosmetics, Downy fabric softener, Hanes underwear, New York Bell, and Folger&#x27;s coffee. From 1987 to 1988, Robinson provided the singing voice for the characters Rapture and Minx in the animated TV series &quot;Jem.&quot;

===Later career===
Robinson regained some publicity from Gloria Estefan&#x27;s 1994 version of &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;. The success of the Estefan single inspired Robinson to re-record the song for the B-side of her 1995 single, &quot;For Real&quot;. This led to TV appearances on a number of talk shows as well as some recording, film, and stage projects. Firstly, she provided backing vocals on RuPaul&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Foxy Lady,&quot; where the two of them also recorded a duet. Then, in 1997, she recorded the song &quot;House of Joy&quot; for DJ/producer Junior Vasquez, which became Robinson&#x27;s first and only hit single in the United Kingdom. She then recorded the song &quot;My Stomp, My Beat&quot; for the film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;. In October of that same year, Robinson played herself on Comedy Central&#x27;s mock TV documentary &quot;Unauthorized Biography: Milo, Death of a Supermodel.&quot; A resurgence of interest in disco music in the mid-1990s led Robinson and fellow disco veterans KC and the Sunshine Band, Thelma Houston, Gloria Gaynor, and The Village People to embark on a well-received world tour.

Upon returning to the U.S. in 1999, Robinson returned to her roots in theatre by performing in an off-Broadway musical titled &quot;Vicki: Behind The Beat&quot; which was semi-autobiographical in nature, and featured her hit songs and her best-known jingles. The play was a continuation of her popular cabaret show. In June of that year, she provided the track &quot;Pokémon (Dance Mix)&quot; from the &quot;Pokémon 2.B.A. Master&quot; soundtrack for the English dub of the Pokémon anime. Three months later, in September, Robinson released her final single, &quot;Move On&quot;, which reached #18 on Billboard&#x27;s Dance Chart. During that same month, she was forced to withdraw from her Off-Broadway show due to poor health. However, before her illness became terminal, Robinson undertook the role of a fairy godmother in the independent film &quot;Red Lipstick,&quot; which was released on April 16, 2000.

==Death==
On April 27, 2000, 11 days after the release of &quot;Red Lipstick,&quot; Robinson died of cancer at her home in Wilton, Connecticut.

<text>ATV is a television station in Melbourne, Australia, part of Network 10 – one of the three major Australian free-to-air commercial television networks. The station is owned by Paramount Networks UK &amp; Australia.

==History==
In April 1963, the licence to operate Melbourne&#x27;s third commercial television station was awarded to Austarama Television, owned by transport magnate Reginald Ansett. The new channel, ATV-0 (pronounced as the letter &quot;O&quot;, never the number &quot;zero&quot;), began transmission on 1 August 1964 from a large modern studio complex, with state-of-the-art videotaping, and located in the then-outer eastern suburb of Nunawading,
in the locality now known as Forest Hill, but referred to at the time as Burwood East.

The new station opened with a preview program hosted by Barry McQueen and Nancy Cato followed by a variety program, &quot;This Is It!&quot;. Reception difficulties (existing sets had to be retuned by a repairman) in parts of the city resulted in the station&#x27;s virtually permanent third position in the Melbourne television ratings.

In 1964, under Reg Ansett, ATV-0 opened their studios in Nunawading, which was at the time the first purpose-built commercial television station in Melbourne. It was also the studio where the first ever colour broadcast in Australia would be filmed, leading to its consideration for heritage status in 2018.

ATV-0 had been experimenting with colour transmissions from 1967, when the station was the first to mount a colour outside broadcast in Australia, from the Pakenham races. Many other colour test transmissions occurred subsequently. Full-time colour transmission was introduced to ATV-0 in March 1975 in line with other stations around the country.

Rupert Murdoch gained a controlling interest in Sydney television station TEN-10 in 1979 and had bought a controlling stake in transport company Ansett, owner of Austarama Television (licensee of ATV-0). That triggered a government inquiry into media ownership, the main concern being Murdoch having a controlling interest in television stations in Australia&#x27;s two largest cities, ignoring the fact that the Kerry Packer-owned Australian Consolidated Press had controlled the Nine Network channels in Melbourne and Sydney for many years.

Due to problems in reception and falling ratings, and the desire to move TV stations out of the VHF band so as to enable FM radio in Australia, the station moved frequency and call-sign from ATV-0 to ATV-10, after getting the agreement of neighbouring Gippsland station GLV-10 to change its frequency to become GLV-8.

On 20 January 1980, the revamped ATV-10 was launched with a jingle campaign (&quot;You&#x27;re on Top With Ten&quot;), Graham Kennedy&#x27;s introductory presentation and &quot;10&#x27;s Summer Sunday&quot;, a 3-hour live outside broadcast from Torquay Beach. Later in the evening, &quot;You&#x27;re On Top With Ten&quot; with Kennedy provided a preview of upcoming shows on the new channel, followed by the movie-length pilot for new drama series &quot;Arcade&quot;.

On 11 February 1980, &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; was relaunched with David Johnston and Jana Wendt as chief newsreaders. By May, &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; went back to its former one-hour duration, claiming that it was &quot;First in Melbourne&quot; due to its many innovations and historic moments and the fact that in the 1970s ATV was the first of the now &quot;Network Ten&quot; stations to adopt the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand and the one-hour newscast(with the first 1-hour newscast debuting in November 1975). Wendt left the channel in 1981 with Charles Slade replacing her and was later replaced by Jo Pearson, who served till 1988, joined by Mal Walden in 1987 and by the next year by Tracey Curro.

By the end of 1981, Murdoch had finally received approval for control of ATV-10.

The 1986 transfer of &quot;Neighbours&quot; to the Ten Network (from the Seven Network) proved to be a success. Aside from its use of suburban locations in Melbourne itself, ATV-10&#x27;s Nunawading studios were used to produce the program.

On 7 September 1992, ATV-10 relocated from the station&#x27;s famous Nunawading studios to the Como Centre in inner suburban South Yarra. The Nunawading complex is now operated by Fremantle Media, while the Como Centre studios in South Yarra are used for &quot;The Project&quot; as well as news, current affairs, entertainment and sport programs.

In 2004, Network 10 finished second nationally, and in ATV-10&#x27;s Melbourne region, only behind the dominant Nine Network.

On 10 December 2013, at 9:00:01am ATV-10 became one of the last stations in Australia to switch off its analog TV signal being the last Network 10 station and 4th last in the whole country of Australia to convert to digital-only transmission, the switch was flicked by Bob Rosenthal a retired ATV-10 engineer who 33 years earlier was there to switch ATV-0 over to ATV-10. Months after the switch the channel, together with the network, marked its golden jubilee anniversary.

==Morning television==
Local mid-morning programming from 1967 included &quot;Morning Magazine&quot;, &quot;Roundabout&quot;, &quot;The Roy Hampson Show&quot;, &quot;In Melbourne Today&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot; (1979–1980) and &quot;Good Morning Melbourne&quot; (1981–1988) - the latter replaced by the Sydney-based &quot;Til Ten&quot; (1989–1991). In 1992, ATV-10 produced &quot;The Morning Show&quot; for the Network Ten, hosted by Bert Newton. The program was re-titled &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; in 1993. &quot;GMA&quot; stayed on air until December 2005 and the following month was replaced by &quot;9am with David &amp; Kim&quot; hosted by Kim Watkins and David Reyne. The show had four years on air and in 2010 was replaced by &quot;The Circle&quot; hosted by Gorgi Coghlan, Yumi Stynes, Chrissie Swan and Denise Drysdale.

In 2012, after 40 years of producing morning television, the Ten Network made the decision to stop production on &quot;The Circle&quot; in favour of providing extra funds for its low-rating &quot;Breakfast&quot; program produced out of Sydney, and hosted by Paul Henry which was itself axed at the end of the year. In November 2013 the Network launched breakfast show &quot;Wake Up&quot; which was broadcast live from both Sydney and Melbourne and hosted by Natarsha Belling and James Mathison with News Updates presented by Nuala Hafner live from a glass studio at Melbourne&#x27;s Federation Square. The show was later axed in May 2014 due to cost-cutting measures.

==News and current affairs==
&quot;10 News First&quot; is presented from ATV-10&#x27;s Como Centre studios in South Yarra by Jennifer Keyte with sports presenter Stephen Quartermain (Monday - Thursday) and Caty Price (Friday) and weather presenter Jayde Cotic. 

ATV-0&#x27;s first news presenter was its news director, Brian Wright, before Barry McQueen took over regular news presenting duties. The station&#x27;s initial news format on weeknights was a 45-minute bulletin starting at 6:15pm, aimed at competing with the 30-minute bulletins offered by rival stations GTV-9 and HSV-7. The news format was changed a number of times, with the eventual adoption of the network&#x27;s one-hour format in the early 1970s, and its take on the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format and brand in 1972, then presented by Geoff Raymond.

The flagship weeknight bulletin was formerly presented by David Johnston, who was replaced by Mal Walden following his move to HSV-7 in 1996. Co-presenter Jennifer Hansen, who with Walden formed one of the longest-serving news duos in Australian television history, was replaced by Helen Kapalos in 2006. Walden became sole anchor in December 2012 following the network&#x27;s decision not to renew Kapalos&#x27; contract a month beforehand.

In February 2018, Brad McEwan announced his resignation from Network Ten to pursue other career opportunities. He finished with the network on Friday 27 April 2018.

Previous fill-in presenters included Brad McEwan and George Donikian.

Regular weekend bulletins from Melbourne were axed in the early 1990s in favour of a national bulletin from Sydney. However, localised editions of &quot;Ten Weekend News&quot; were reintroduced on Saturdays during the AFL season and presented by George Donikian, followed by a localised edition of &quot;Sports Tonight&quot; for Victoria. Permanent weekend bulletins were reintroduced in January 2011 (alongside a short-lived 6:30pm bulletin on weeknights) but discontinued ten months later.

From September 2020 to February 2023, ATV-10 also oversaw studio production of the Adelaide edition of &quot;10 News First&quot;. Both bulletins are presented by Jennifer Keyte, combining local opt-outs for news, sport and weather with some shared content from the two states.

<text>F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, commonly known as Roche (), is a Swiss multinational holding healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Its holding company, Roche Holding AG, has shares listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The company headquarters are located in Basel. 
Roche is the fifth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue and the leading provider of cancer treatments globally. In 2023, the company’s seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 76.

The company owns the American biotechnology company Genentech, which is a wholly owned independent subsidiary, and the Japanese biotechnology company Chugai Pharmaceuticals, as well as the United States–based companies Ventana and Foundation Medicine. Roche&#x27;s revenues during fiscal year 2020, were 58.32 billion Swiss francs. Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm Novartis owning a further third of its shares until 2021. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2020 as the 34th consecutive year.

F. Hoffmann-La Roche is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

==History==
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was known early on for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. During the Second World War, Roche collaborated with the Nazi regime in Germany and used forced labour in its German and Polish-based factories. They also moved all their Jewish employees to the United States to save them from Nazi attention.

In 1957, Hoffmann-La Roche introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, was revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large dioxin contamination. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.

Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995, the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA&#x27;s approval of Hoffman LaRoche&#x27;s HIV protease inhibitor, saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000. On 28 April 1995, Hoffmann-La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings). Roche acquired Syntex in 1994, and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.

Oseltamivir an antiviral drug used to combat influenza. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996, and in 2005, settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowed in the original licensing agreement.

==Price-fixing conspiracy==
Stanley Adams, Roche&#x27;s World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.

In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the US and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.

==Controversies==
During the Second World War, Roche was reported to have collaborated with the Nazi regime in Germany and used prisoners-of-war or foreign forced labour in its German and Polish-based factories.

In 2008 the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) suspended Roche for six months for breaching their code of conduct.

In 2013, Roche had to pay back billion to the Swiss tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.

==Collaborative research==
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann-La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox. The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.

<text>Tall Dwarfs are a New Zealand rock band formed in 1981 by Chris Knox and Alec Bathgate, who helped pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music. The duo were former members of Toy Love.

The band lacked a drummer, but would use household objects and hand claps to act as percussion. Both members can play guitar, with 12 strings and bass guitar often heard on their records. Both can play organ as well, which has been utilised on some of their songs. The Casiotone is frequently used too, especially on live concerts.

Their debut was the EP &quot;Three Songs&quot; (1981), and for many years they released EPs only. The album &quot;Weeville&quot; (1990) was their first full-length album. They did, however, release a number of full-length compilations of their EPs, like &quot;Hello Cruel World&quot; and &quot;The Short and Sick of It&quot;.

In the liner notes to their album &quot;3 EPs&quot; (1994) (released as a single CD, or as three vinyl EPs collected in one box), they asked for listeners&#x27; rhythm tracks: &quot;Send us your idea of a great T.D. throb.&quot; The responses came from many different countries and were used for the next album, &quot;Stumpy&quot; (1997). This album was credited to &quot;International Tall Dwarfs.&quot;

Bands who have claimed to be influenced by the Tall Dwarfs include Guided by Voices, Jay Reatard, Superchunk, Elf Power, Neutral Milk Hotel and Olivia Tremor Control. In 2005, they did a small number of concerts in the US, playing with the Olivia Tremor Control.

<doc id="548758" wikidata="Q1431347" url="?curid=548758" title="Hermitage AOC">
<text>Hermitage () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France south of Lyon. It produces mostly red wine from the Syrah grape; however, small quantities of white wine are also produced from Roussane and Marsanne grapes. The hill is seen by some as the spiritual home of the Syrah grape variety.

== History ==
According to legend, the Knight Gaspard de Stérimberg returned home wounded in 1224 from the Albigensian Crusade and was given permission by the Queen of France to build a small refuge to recover in, where he remained living as a hermit (&quot;ermite&quot; in French). The chapel on top was built in honor of Saint Christopher and today is owned by the negociant Paul Jaboulet Âiné. Louis XIII made the wine a wine of the court after being offered a glass during a visit to the region in 1642. Louis XIV presented King Charles II of England with 200 casks of fine wine including examples from Hermitage, Champagne and Burgundy. The Romanovs also imported the wine. In the 19th century, wines from Bordeaux were often &quot;hermitaged&quot; (&quot;hermitagé&quot;, that is, blended with Hermitage) and could fetch higher prices as a result. The appellation was established in its modern form in 1937.

== Geography ==
The appellation fans out from the town of Tain l&#x27;Hermitage. The vines grow on the south west side of a steep granite hill facing the afternoon sun and can be divided into a number of smaller vineyards. These are &quot;&quot;Les Bessards&quot; to the west, &quot;L&#x27;Hermite&quot; and &quot;&quot;La Chapelle&quot; on the top of the mountain, and &quot;&quot;Bessards&quot;, &quot;Le Méal&quot;, &quot;Les Greffieux&quot;, and &quot;Murets&quot;&quot; to the east. With of vines, in soil composed greatly of granite and gravels, Hermitage produces 730,000 bottles of mostly red wines, annually.

== Grape Varieties ==

Syrah is the primary red grape of Hermitage, mostly used on its own although the appellation rules do allow the addition of 15% or less of Marsanne and/or Roussanne grapes. Hermitage reds tend toward being very earthy, with aromas of leather, red berries, earth, and cocoa/coffee. Because of the high levels of tannin they are usually aged longer than American or Australian Syrahs and are often cellared up to 40 years.

Rich, dry, white wines are also produced from a blend of Marsanne and Roussanne. These wines are also usually left to age, for up to 15 years. Vin de paille or &quot;Straw Wine&quot; is also produced in this region.

== Notable Producers ==

The most notable producer of Hermitage is Domaine Jean-Louis Chave, whose estate can trace its origins back to 1481. Others of note include Chapoutier, Jaboulet, and Delas.

<text>Höllviken is a locality situated in Vellinge Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 15,678 inhabitants in 2019. It is located close to both Malmö and the Øresund Bridge which connects Sweden and Denmark.

The town is a popular summer vacation spot for northern Europeans, who are attracted to its sand beaches and the historical sites which date back to the time of the Vikings. The peninsula on which the town is situated is unique because it is surrounded by two different seas: Öresund and the Baltic Sea.

Prior to the 1960s, the peninsula remained mainly populated by wealthy businessmen from the Malmö region during the summers. Recently, however, it has begun to grow as a commuter town.

The following sports clubs are located in Höllviken:

<text>Verse is a networking protocol allowing real-time communication between computer graphics software. For example, several architects can build a house in the same virtual environment using their own computers, even if they are using different software. If one architect builds a spiral staircase, it instantly appears on the screens of all other users. Verse is designed to use the capacity of one or multiple computers over the Internet: for example, allowing a user with a hand-held computer in Spain to work with the rendering power of a supercomputer in Japan. Its principles are very general, allowing its use in contexts that are advantageous to collaboration such as gaming and visual presentations.

== Uni-Verse ==
The Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), with several collaborators including the Interactive Institute, set up an EU project called Uni-Verse. The EU Commission granted them nearly SEK 18 million over the next several years to develop a system for graphics, sound, and acoustics using Verse and making it into an open source platform.

<text>Fulvius Macrianus (), also called Macrianus Major, was a Roman usurper. He was one of Valerian&#x27;s fiscal officers. More precisely, sources refer to him as being in charge of the whole state accounts (&quot;A rationibus&quot;) or, in the language of a later age, as Count of the Treasury (&quot;Comes Sacrarum Largitionum&quot;) and the person in charge of markets and provisions. It seems almost certain that he was an Equestrian. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; claims that he was the foremost of Valerian&#x27;s military commanders, but that is most likely a gross exaggeration, if not entirely fictitious.
He followed Valerian during his ultimately catastrophic campaign against the Persians in 259 or 260; however, he remained at Samosata during the fatal battle of Edessa and his role in the events before and after the battle is questionable. After Valerian&#x27;s capture by Sassanid Emperor Shapur I, Valerian&#x27;s son Gallienus became sole emperor, but was occupied with his own problems in the West. Macrianus grabbed the opportunity. With the support of Balista, one of Valerian&#x27;s military commanders, and with the influence that possession of the treasury of Valerian brought, Macrianus managed to have his two sons Macrianus Minor and Quietus elevated to the throne. He himself was not able to assume the purple because he was deformed in one of his legs.

Quietus and Balista stayed in the East to secure their rule. Macrianus Major and Minor marched the eastern army from Asia to Europe, but were defeated in Thrace in 261 by Aureolus. Macrianus and his son were killed in the battle. According to Joannes Zonaras, their army was encircled by Aureolus and surrendered, except for the Pannonian legions. Macrianus asked to be killed with his son to avoid delivery to Aureolus. Quietus was later murdered by Odaenathus of Palmyra.

<doc id="548770" wikidata="Q2079445" url="?curid=548770" title="Peterborough, Victoria">
<text>Peterborough () is a town on the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Australia, approximately three hours&#x27; drive from Melbourne. The town is situated on land to the west side of the mouth of the Curdies River.

==History==

Aboriginal peoples occupied the area for thousands of years before European settlement.

In 1845 Dr Daniel Curdie made the difficult journey from his homestead at Tandarook to follow the river to its mouth. He named the area Peterborough after his friend Dr Peter Reid of Richmond.

The town was believed to have been founded when the schooner &quot;SS Schomberg&quot; was wrecked in the middle of the 19th century, though the town was not sufficiently populated to justify a post office until 10 April 1890. It has since become a fishing and holiday village. There are two public tennis courts and beaches, and a nine-hole golf course at the Peterborough Golf Club on Schomberg Road.

At the , Peterborough had a population of 178, which had grown to 247 at the 2016 census.

The town is situated near The Twelve Apostles and London Bridge land formations, and is part of the Shipwreck Coast. Many ships have been wrecked in the vicinity, due to limestone cliffs eroding away and leaving patches of harder rock concealed just under the waves quite a distance out to sea. This erosion continues, evidenced by the London Bridge formation collapsing in the early 1990s. One of the most famous wrecks was the &quot;Falls of Halladale&quot; which was wrecked in 1908 in thick fog, and became a tourist attraction for the next few years as it remained on the reef it was stuck on.

==Traditional ownership==
The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Peterborough sits are groups within the Eastern Maar people, who are represented by the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation (EMAC).

==Trivia==
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser owned a property in the town. Fraser was a keen fisherman.

<doc id="548771" wikidata="Q407613" url="?curid=548771" title="Lithium hydroxide">
<text>Lithium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula LiOH. It can exist as anhydrous or hydrated, and both forms are white hygroscopic solids. They are soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Both are available commercially. While classified as a strong base, lithium hydroxide is the weakest known alkali metal hydroxide.

==Production==
The preferred feedstock is hard-rock spodumene, where the lithium content is expressed as % lithium oxide.

===Lithium carbonate route===
Lithium hydroxide is often produced industrially from lithium carbonate in a metathesis reaction with calcium hydroxide: 
The initially produced hydrate is dehydrated by heating under vacuum up to 180 °C.

===Lithium sulfate route===
An alternative route involves the intermediacy of lithium sulfate:
:α-spodumene → β-spodumene
:β-spodumene + CaO → + ...
:

The main by-products are gypsum and sodium sulphate, which have some market value.

==Commercial setting==
According to Bloomberg, Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd. (GFL or Ganfeng) and Albemarle were the largest producers in 2020 with around 25kt/y, followed by Livent Corporation (FMC) and SQM. Significant new capacity is planned, to keep pace with demand driven by vehicle electrification. Ganfeng are to expand lithium chemical capacity to 85,000 tons, adding the capacity leased from Jiangte, Ganfeng will become the largest lithium hydroxide producer globally in 2021.

Albemarle&#x27;s Kemerton WA plant, originally planned to deliver 100kt/y has been scaled back to 50kt/y.

In 2020 Tianqi Lithium&#x27;s, plant in Kwinana, Western Australia is the largest producer, with a capacity of 48kt/y.

==Applications==
===Lithium-ion batteries===
Lithium hydroxide is mainly consumed in the production of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries such as lithium cobalt oxide () and lithium iron phosphate. It is preferred over lithium carbonate as a precursor for lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides.

===Grease===
A popular lithium grease thickener is lithium 12-hydroxystearate, which produces a general-purpose lubricating grease due to its high resistance to water and usefulness at a range of temperatures.

===Carbon dioxide scrubbing===

Lithium hydroxide is used in breathing gas purification systems for spacecraft, submarines, and rebreathers to remove carbon dioxide from exhaled gas by producing lithium carbonate and water:
or
The latter, anhydrous hydroxide, is preferred for its lower mass and lesser water production for respirator systems in spacecraft. One gram of anhydrous lithium hydroxide can remove 450 cm3 of carbon dioxide gas. The monohydrate loses its water at 100–110 °C.

===Precursor===
Lithium hydroxide, together with lithium carbonate, is a key intermediates used for the production of other lithium compounds, illustrated by its use in the production of lithium fluoride:

===Other uses===
It is also used in ceramics and some Portland cement formulations, where it is also used to suppress ASR (concrete cancer). 

Lithium hydroxide (isotopically enriched in lithium-7) is used to alkalize the reactor coolant in pressurized water reactors for corrosion control.
It is good radiation protection against free neutrons.

==Price==
In 2012, the price of lithium hydroxide was about US$5–6/kg.

In December 2020, it had risen to $9/kg

On 18 March 2021, the price had risen to $11.50/kg

<text>A domain name scam is a type of intellectual property scam or confidence scam in which unscrupulous domain name registrars attempt to generate revenue by tricking businesses into buying, selling, listing or converting a domain name. The Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom has outlined two types of domain name scams which are &quot;Domain name registration scams&quot; and &quot;Domain name renewal scams&quot;.

== Domain slamming ==

Domain slamming (also known as unauthorized transfers or domain name registration scams) is a scam in which the offending domain name registrar attempts to trick domain owners into switching from their existing registrar to theirs, under the pretense that the customer is simply renewing their subscription to their current registrar. The term derives from telephone slamming.

=== Prevention ===
In 2004, ICANN, the domain name governing body, made changes to its policy for transferring domains between registrars. They introduced a single protective measure that can help prevent unauthorized transfers: domain locking. Critics, although advising owners to apply the new feature, said that this was an &quot;unnecessary and customer-unfriendly change&quot;.

== False offers to buy, or to find buyers ==
Scam methods may operate in reverse, with a stranger (not the registrar) communicating an offer to buy a domain name from an unwary owner. The offer is not genuine, but intended to lure the owner into a false sales process, with the owner eventually pressed to send money in advance to the scammer for appraisal fees or other purported services. By mimicking aspects of the legitimate sales process and agencies, the scheme appears genuine in the early stages. The prospect of an easy, lucrative sale disarms the owner&#x27;s normal suspicion of an unsolicited offer from a stranger with no earnest value. Since an actual transfer through the registration system is never involved, legal safeguards built into the official transfer process provide no protection.

== Fake trademark protection ==
Although less common than domain slamming, another domain name scam primarily coming from registrars based in China involves sending domain owners an e-mail claiming that another company has just attempted to register a number of domains with them which contain the targeted domain owner&#x27;s trademark or has many keyword similarities to their existing domain name. Often, these domains will be the same as the one(s) owned by the targeted individual but with different TLDs (top-level domains). The scammer will claim to have halted the bulk registration in order to protect the targeted individual&#x27;s intellectual property, and if the email recipient doesn&#x27;t recognize the entity attempting to register these domain names, that they should respond immediately to protect their trademark. If the scam target does respond by email or by phone, the scammer will then try to get them to register these domain names for several years upfront with the registrar running this scam.

Other variations of this type of scam include registrars that target their own existing customers with similar made-up threats of another entity trying to register the same domain as theirs under different TLDs. As well, some domainers are known to search for available TLDs for already registered domains, then emailing the owner of the registered domain and offering to sell the unregistered variations to him/her for a marked up amount. If the target agrees to the deal, the domainer will then purchase the domains on the spot for the regular $7~20 registration fee and immediately sell it back to the victim for a few hundred dollars.

== Timeline ==
This section outlines reported domain scams as a timeline of events, showing how they have evolved, the companies involved and the outcome of complaints.

* In 2001, the federal Competition Bureau (of Canada) issued a warning about documents that appeared to be invoices sent out by a business called the &quot;Internet Registry of Canada&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller).
** &quot;Complaints received by the Competition Bureau indicate that the mailings from the &#x27;Internet Registry of Canada&#x27; give the impression that it is affiliated with the Government of Canada or that it is an officially sanctioned agency registering domain names in Canada. The &#x27;Internet Registry of Canada&#x27; is not associated with any government agency,&quot; the Competition Bureau advisory stated.
* VeriSign was sued in 2002 for their actions in sending ambiguous emails informing people, often incorrectly, that their domain was about to expire and inviting them to click on a link to renew it. Renewing the domain resulted in the registration company being transferred to VeriSign from the previous registrar.
* In March 2002, the FTC shut down &quot;TLD Network Ltd&quot;, &quot;Quantum Management (GB) Ltd.&quot;, &quot;TBS Industries Ltd.&quot; of London, England, for selling bogus domain names &quot;.USA&quot;, &quot;.BRIT&quot;, which they deceptively marketed as usable suffixes.
* In April 2002, the FTC charged &quot;National Domain Name Registry&quot;, &quot;Electronic Domain Name Monitoring&quot;, &quot;Corporate Domain Name Monitoring&quot;, and owner Darren J. Morgenstern, with making false and misleading statements to domain name holders whereby they duped consumers into needlessly registering variations of their existing domain names by deceptively contending that third parties were about to claim them.
* On 2 July 2002, the &quot;Domain Registry&quot; served papers against Canada-based domain registrar Tucows Inc for alleged defamation and sought $21 m in damages. Tucows later said: &quot;The Company (Tucows) does not believe it will be liable for any damages and accordingly has not accrued any amounts at June 30, 2002.&quot;
* In 2002, Register.com sued &quot;Domain Registry of America&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller), claiming the company illegally lured away thousands of customers by tricking them into transferring their domains.
* In 2002, the UK Advertising Watchdog Authority (ASA) slammed &quot;Domain Registry of Europe&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller) over similar mail shots.
** In response to this, Alan Freeman, Relations Manager for &quot;DRoE&quot;, said that the company - which also trades as &quot;Domain Registry of America&quot; and &quot;Domain Registry of Canada&quot; - had registered 1.1 million domains for customers and was registering between 5,000 and 7,000 new domains a day.
* In 2003, Dutch hosting provider Deinternetman pondered legal action against &quot;Domain Registry of Europe&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller) for sending their customers letters urging them to renew their domain contracts.
* In 2003, VeriSign was found not to have broken the law but were barred from suggesting that a domain was about to expire or that a transfer was actually a renewal.
* In 2003, the Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement with the &quot;Domain Registry of America&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller) for practices such as transferring domain registrations to their service under the guise of domain renewal, a practice known as &quot;domain slamming&quot;, and having hidden fees.
* In July 2004, Daniel Klemann and &quot;1480455 Ontario Incorporated&quot;, operating as &quot;Internet Registry of Canada&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller), was sentenced to a $40,000 fine and a five-year prohibition order for deceptive Internet domain name renewal mailouts that targeted 73,000 businesses and non-profit organizations across Canada.
* In April 2005, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission warns of a domain name renewal scam where domain name holders have received a letter that looks like an invoice for the registration or renewal of a domain name, where the domain name in question is very similar to your actual domain name except has a different ending, for example it will end in “.net.au” instead of “.com” 
* In March 2006, Consumer Fraud Reporting reports about a company called “Domain Listing Service” sending out emails to domain name holders that look like a bill to register/renew their domain name listing a “final notice”.
* In 2006, reports appeared from New Zealand that Blair Rafferty had resurrected his bankrupt brother Chesley&#x27;s domain name service, &quot;domain slamming&quot; New Zealand and Australian registrants.
* In 2007, a company known as &quot;Domain Renewal SA&quot; operating from Brussels was sending out emails that told you that you need to renew your domain.
* In August 2007, the Internet Centre reports of a wave of emails originating from China from “Asian Domain Registration Service”, implying that a domain name will be lost, or all Asian TLDs of the domain name will be taken away shortly by a foreign company. The Internet Centre has found no indication that any of these are valid, and in fact, they appear to be a scam.
* In 2007, it was reported that a company under the name of &quot;Liberty Names of America&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller) had been sending out &quot;Domain Name Expiration Notices&quot;, which one expert said is &quot;not exactly &quot;domain name slamming&quot;. But it is sleazy marketing.&quot;
* In March 2008, PC News Digest reports “Network Solutions Scam”. When searching on the Network Solutions website to see if a name was available for registration, Network Solutions was actually registering the name and then attempting to sell that name at an inflated price.
* In 2008, ICANN said: &quot;we are aware of accredited registrars in North America with officers that have been convicted of mail fraud, that continue to be associated with the deceptive marketing practices employed by the &quot;Domain Registry of America&quot; (a Brandon Gray reseller). We do not consider this an acceptable situation. Accreditation processes must be reviewed, and that review must be released for public scrutiny&quot;.
* In 2009, ASA released an adjudication on &quot;Domain Registry of America&quot; t/a &quot;Domain Renewal Group&quot; (both Brandon Gray resellers).
* As of 2010, the company mailing as &quot;DROA&quot;, &quot;French Internet Registry&quot;, &quot;Domain Renewal Group&quot; or &quot;Company Directory&quot;, is doing so in order to achieve &quot;domain slamming&quot;. McAfee Labs also reports that the &quot;domain slamming&quot; solicitations continue.
* In September 2010, &quot;Brandon Gray Internet Services Inc.&quot; had its licence with the authority responsible for Canada&#x27;s .ca domain names, Canadian Internet Registration Authority terminated as a result of &quot;domain slamming&quot; carried out under the name of &quot;Domain Registry of Canada&quot;. The officer registered with the Ontario government for Brandon Gray Internet Services is Marilyn Benlolo.
* In August 2010, the FTC charged &quot;Internet Listing Service&quot; with sending fake invoices to small business and others listing the existing domain name of the consumers Website or a slight variation on the domain name.
* On March 31, 2011, the law office of Ostrolenk Faber LLP warned about Trademark and Domain Name Scams where its clients received fake warnings of usurpers of internet domain names. Clients were allegedly receiving phony &quot;Trademark Office Notices&quot; from the &quot;United States Trademark Agency&quot;.
*In December 2011, NameCheap accused GoDaddy of putting technical barriers to frustrate its customers from transferring their domains to Namecheap in breach of ICANN rules.
* In July 2014, ICANN suspended &quot;Brandon Gray Internet Services&quot; (including its various resellers, like &quot;Domain Registry of America&quot; and &quot;Namejuice.com&quot;) for subjecting domain name holders to false advertising, deceptive practices, or deceptive notices.

<doc id="548774" wikidata="Q650846" url="?curid=548774" title="Reality (David Bowie album)">
<text>Reality is the twenty-fourth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, originally released in Europe on 15September 2003, and the following day in America. His second release through his own ISO label, the album was recorded between January and May 2003 at Looking Glass Studios in New York City, with production by Bowie and longtime collaborator Tony Visconti. Most of the musicians consisted of his then-touring band. Bowie envisioned the album as a set of songs that could be played live.

A mostly straightforward rock album with a more direct sound compared to its predecessor &quot;Heathen&quot; (2002), &quot;Reality&quot; contains covers of the Modern Lovers&#x27; &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; and George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;. One of the tracks, &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot;, dated back to 1992. A primary theme throughout &quot;Reality&quot; concerns reflections on ageing, while other songs focus on despaired and diminished characters. The cover artwork depicts Bowie as an anime-style character that exhibited the idea that reality had become an abstract concept.

Released under a variety of CD formats, &quot;Reality&quot; charted in numerous countries and reached number three in the United Kingdom. It failed to outperform &quot;Heathen&quot; in the United States, reaching number 29. The album was not supported through conventional single releases, although &quot;New Killer Star&quot; and &quot;Never Get Old&quot; appeared in some countries. &quot;Reality&quot; received largely positive reviews from music critics on release, with many highlighting the music, lyrics, vocal performances and the growing maturity in Bowie&#x27;s songwriting.

Bowie supported the album on the worldwide A Reality Tour throughout 2003 and 2004, his biggest and final concert tour, which ended prematurely after Bowie was hospitalised for a blocked artery. Bowie thereafter largely retreated from public life and did not release another studio album until &quot;The Next Day&quot; in 2013, making &quot;Reality&quot; his last album of original material for ten years.

== Recording and production ==
===Writing===
David Bowie began writing songs immediately after the Heathen Tour ended in October 2002. His new distribution deal with Columbia Records gave him the freedom to record at his own pace, so he was eager to return to the studio quickly. He elected to bring back Tony Visconti to co-produce the new album after the pair&#x27;s successful renewed partnership with &quot;Heathen&quot; (2002). He stated:

Bowie and Visconti began initial ideas for the new album in November 2002. The success of the Heathen Tour rejuvenated Bowie&#x27;s desire for touring, so the two fashioned the new album with the goal for the songs to be played live. One of the first songs tracked was &quot;Reality&quot;, which became the title of the new album. The songwriting process itself was varied. Some tracks were written more conventionally, such as &quot;She&#x27;ll Drive the Big Car&quot;, while others were fashioned using a series of loops over a melody, such as &quot;Looking for Water&quot;. The length of time to write the songs also varied. &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot; was written in only 30 minutes, while &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot; was written in 1992 and originally intended to appear on &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; (1993) before being slated for &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997) and finally completed for &quot;Reality&quot;.

===Sessions===

Recording for &quot;Reality&quot; began in early January 2003 at Looking Glass Studios in New York City, where &quot;Earthling&quot; and &quot;Hours&quot; (1999) were recorded. Bowie opted to use Looking Glass&#x27;s smaller Studio B, which Visconti was renting on a semi-permanent basis, rather than the more spacious Studio A in order to have, in Visconti&#x27;s words, a &quot;real tight New York sound&quot;. The studio was within close distance to Bowie&#x27;s New York apartment, and his familiarity with the studio corresponded to relatively easy-going eight-hour working days, five days a week. The urban landscape served as an influence on the new material, similar to how the mountainous Allaire Studios had influenced the recording of &quot;Heathen&quot;.

The musicians mostly consisted of Bowie&#x27;s then-touring band: Earl Slick and Gerry Leonard on guitar, Mark Plati on guitar and bass, Mike Garson on piano, and Sterling Campbell on drums; the live bassist Gail Ann Dorsey and the multi-instrumentalist Catherine Russell only contributed backing vocals. &quot;Heathen&quot;&#x27;s guitarist David Torn provided &quot;atmospheric&quot; overdubs and lead guitar on &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, while Matt Chamberlain played drums on &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s longtime guitarist Carlos Alomar also contributed overdubs to &quot;Fly&quot;; these overdubs were his final collaboration with Bowie.

Bowie arrived with four to five basic home demos he had prepared; he told &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t want my home to be taken over by the recording process. I&#x27;m very wary of that. I really saved everything for working over at Looking Glass.&quot; He, Visconti and the assistant engineer Mario J. McNulty initially worked on demos before the entire band arrived, many of which ended up in the final mixes, including Visconti&#x27;s bass playing on &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot;, &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot;. McNulty&#x27;s percussion on &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot; was also retained for the final mix.

Similar to &quot;Heathen&quot;, Bowie played many instruments himself, including guitar, saxophone, Stylophone and keyboards, although Garson played prominently on &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot; and &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot;. Like previous releases, bass, percussion and rhythm guitar parts were recorded live first from January and February, followed by vocals and overdubs from March to May 2003; Bowie, Plati and Campbell primarily played to click tracks from the demos. Visconti brought back an old-fashioned 16-track analogue method of recording previously used on &quot;Heathen&quot;. Eight tracks were yielded after the initial eight-day session. Bowie revealed on his website in April that he had written 16 tracks, eight of which he was &quot;mad for&quot;.

Believing the drum tracks lacked the ambience and impact of &quot;Heathen&quot;″s due to the studio, Bowie and Visconti travelled to Allaire and played the tracks back through the speakers to capture the same sound. This drum ambience is found sporadically throughout &quot;Reality&quot;, particularly on the cover of the Modern Lovers&#x27; &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; and &quot;Looking for Water&quot;. Bowie recorded three separate vocal tracks for each track – one after the rhythm tracks were completed, another midway through the sessions and the final during mixing. Most tracks featured a single vocal take while others were stitched together from different ones. His vocals had also improved greatly due to Bowie having recently quit smoking; Visconti remarked that it regained &quot;at least five semitones&quot;.

===Mixing===
Mixing for &quot;Reality&quot; took place at Looking Glass under the direction of Visconti; Bowie no longer found a desire to contribute. Visconti used Studio B instead of Studio A as both he and Bowie were satisfied with the former&#x27;s mixing boards. Similar to &quot;Heathen&quot;, the producer created both a standard stereo and 5.1 mix for release on SACD formats, which was made at Studio A. Of the 5.1 mix, Visconti said:

==Music and lyrics==
Compared to &quot;Heathen&quot;, the music on &quot;Reality&quot; is mostly straightforward rock and pop rock, with a more direct and aggressive sound. Consisting of mostly original compositions, the album includes two cover songs originally slated for Bowie&#x27;s scrapped follow-up to his 1973 covers album &quot;Pin Ups&quot;: the Modern Lovers&#x27; &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;, written by Jonathan Richman released on their eponymous studio album in 1976, and George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;, originally recorded by Ronnie Spector in 1971 before Harrison recorded his own version in 1973. The author James E. Perone writes that the two tracks match the album&#x27;s autobiographical tones compared to other covers Bowie made throughout his career, which were more often chosen for similar musical styles. Other covers recorded during the sessions included the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; and Sigue Sigue Sputnik&#x27;s &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot;. The principle sub-theme of &quot;Reality&quot; concerns thoughts on ageing. Following an assortment of &quot;extreme&quot; characters from a &quot;gluttonous rock star vampire&quot; to various diminished figures, the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary draws comparisons to &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970).

===Songs===

The opening track, &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, recalls the &quot;gentle beginnings&quot; of &quot;Heathen&quot; before erupting into a groove. Pegg compares its guitar style to Bowie&#x27;s own &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974) and &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (1987), as well as Blur&#x27;s &quot;Think Tank&quot; (2003). Lyrically, the song depicts the emotional and physical scarring of New York City following the September 11 attacks, with lines such as &quot;see the great white scar over Battery Park&quot;. Pegg states that the second verse&#x27;s juxtaposition of the real versus fake establishes a common theme throughout the entire album. On covering &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;, Bowie explained that he enjoyed its &quot;fantastically funny lyric&quot;. With updated lyrics and new chords, his rendition is more upbeat and rockier compared to the minimalist original, but remains tongue-in-cheek. Visconti&#x27;s production utilises a wall of synthesisers against bursts of guitar and energetic percussion.

&quot;Never Get Old&quot; features a guitar hook and bassline over echoing percussion. Recalling the themes and styles of &quot;Heathen&quot;, &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (both 1977), the song presents a reflection on ageing and an expression on both desperation and denial. Pegg notes that the thought of &quot;never getting old&quot; has been a mainstay in Bowie&#x27;s songwriting, in tracks from &quot;Changes&quot; (1971) to &quot;The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell&quot; (1999), and considers &quot;I think about this and I think about personal history&quot; a &quot;key line&quot; for the entire &quot;Reality&quot; album. &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot; is the quietest and most reflective track on the album, which Pegg analyses as a &quot;haunting meditation on memory, fortune and happiness&quot;. Its subject is a loner who realises he is lucky, as he has no one else to look out for but himself. Bowie revealed that the imagery was inspired by the modernist city of Brasília; in his words, &quot;a city taken over by weeds&quot;.

&quot;Looking for Water&quot; combines Slick&#x27;s &quot;discordant guitar squeals&quot; with a repetitive bassline and &quot;metronomic&quot; drums. Both Pegg and O&#x27;Leary found echoes of &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; tracks, particularly &quot;Glass Spider&quot;. Similar to &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, the song concerns post-9/11 nihilism. Perone analyses it as symbolic of the basic necessities of life while the narrator is surrounded by the trappings of modern technology. Like several of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;She&#x27;ll Drive the Big Car&quot; eavesdrops onto a wretched and despairing life in which a woman dreams of wealth but is stuck being a mundane house wife. Musically, it is a funkier number reminiscent of Bowie&#x27;s soul era, particularly tracks like &quot;Golden Years&quot; (1975).

&quot;Days&quot; is a love song that continues the album&#x27;s sub-themes of &quot;weary retrospection and aging regret&quot;. Bowie stated during a concert in Melbourne that &quot;I sometimes feel I wrote this song for so many people&quot;. It is musically simple, boasting a &quot;faux-naif arrangement of low-tech synthesisers and twanging guitars against a jogging beat&quot;, compared by Pegg to the 1980s works of Soft Cell and Depeche Mode. According to Bowie, the title of &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot; came from a Kellogg Brown &amp; Root article and was subtle commentary on the then-emerging Iraq War. He further described it as &quot;an ugly song sung by an ugly man&quot;, whom he hinted as being then-US vice-president Dick Cheney. Musically, the song contains similar rhythms and melodies as &quot;New Killer Star&quot; and &quot;Heathen&quot;.

Bowie wanted to cover &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; as far back as 1979 before finally doing so for &quot;Reality&quot;. Pegg states that it unwittingly became a tribute to Harrison, who died in November 2001. The arrangement on Bowie&#x27;s version mostly stays true to the original, although in the artist&#x27;s words, &quot;the overall atmosphere is somewhat different&quot;. Pegg and Perone contend that the &quot;retrospective, older-and-wiser lyric&quot; is appropriate for both &quot;Reality&quot; and Bowie himself. The hard rock title track is the album&#x27;s loudest and rockiest moment, recalling &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; (1995) and Bowie&#x27;s works with the rock band Tin Machine. The song adopts the artificial narrative that real life has no narrative, and its message, concerning how the quest for meaning in life is always doomed to fail, lies at the centre of the album&#x27;s loose theme. Perone opines that it sees Bowie acknowledge that he hid behind personas and drugs throughout the early 1970s and is now facing reality.

Pegg calls &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot; &quot;one of the most idiosyncratic and strikingly dramatic numbers in the entire Bowie songbook&quot;. Following its earlier incarnations, Bowie and Garson stripped the song down to a four-bar drum loop, vocal and piano, which the former felt worked best. Almost eight minutes in length, the song embraces a New York jazz sound that sees Garson playing an improvised piano solo similar to his one on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973). Representing a culmination of the album&#x27;s lyrical themes, it offers fragmented images of, in Pegg&#x27;s words, &quot;creeping age, squandered opportunities, thwarted lives and impending dissolution&quot;. The outtake &quot;Fly&quot; utilises a funky guitar riff for a tale about a middle-class family man who suffers from anxiety and depression, lyrically forestalling the &quot;domestic American angst&quot; of &quot;New Killer Star&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;ll Drive the Big Car&quot;.

==Title and artwork==

Bowie announced the album title in June 2002. Reflecting the ideal that reality has become an abstract concept, he said that the title &quot;encapsulate[s] the prosaic nature of the project itself&quot;. The cover artwork was designed by Jonathan Barnbrook in collaboration with the graphic artist Rex Ray; Barnbrook previously created the typography for &quot;Heathen&quot;, while Ray designed the artworks for &quot;Hours&quot; and the &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; compilation (2002). Ditching the airbrushed intellectualism of &quot;Heathen&quot;, &quot;Reality&quot; depicts Bowie in a cartoon, anime-style persona, with features typical of Japanese animation, including an exaggerated hairstyle, oversized eyes and simplified lines. He steps forward against a background of various shapes, ink blobs, balloons and stars. Bowie compared it to &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; and bluntly stated in an interview: &quot;The whole thing has a subtext of &#x27;I&#x27;m taking the piss, this is not supposed to be reality&#x27;.&quot;

==Release==
In the weeks prior to its release, the album was promoted on Bowie&#x27;s website BowieNet through the posting of excerpts of each track, titled &quot;&quot;Reality&quot; jukebox&quot;, while the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; released various CD-ROM featurettes. ISO and Columbia officially issued &quot;Reality&quot; in Europe and other territories on 15 September 2003, and in America the following day. Like &quot;Heathen&quot;, it appeared in two CD formats: a single disc and a two-disc version with the outtakes &quot;Fly&quot; and &quot;Queen of All the Tarts (Overture)&quot;, along with a studio re-recording of Bowie&#x27;s 1974 single &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;; the Japanese CD included &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; as a bonus track. In the ensuing months other versions appeared, including a &quot;Tour Edition&quot; to coincide with the A Reality Tour in each territory the tour travelled to; the November European release included &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; and a DVD containing a complete performance of &quot;Reality&quot; from 8 September at Riverside Studios.

The SACD release came in December 2003; EMI also issued a remixed SACD in September, which was packaged with Bowie&#x27;s albums &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (1972), &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; (1980) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983). In February 2004, Columbia issued &quot;Reality&quot; on the new DualDisc format, containing the standard album on one side and the 5.1 mix in DVD-Audio format on the other. This release was initially restricted to the Boston and Seattle areas of the United States, with a worldwide release 12 months later. &quot;Reality&quot; did not receive an official release on vinyl until 2014 by the label Music on Vinyl.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Reality&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number three, becoming Bowie&#x27;s highest charting album in the UK since &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; ten years prior. However, sales quickly fell after only four weeks. The album topped the charts in Denmark and the Czech Republic, and entered &quot;Billboard&quot; European Top 100 Albums at number one. Across Europe, &quot;Reality&quot; peaked at number two in France, Norway and Scotland, number three in Austria, Belgium Wallonia and Germany, number four in Belgium Flanders and Italy, number five in Sweden and Switzerland, number six in Ireland and Portugal, and number eight in Finland. It also reached number nine in Canada.

It fared worse in other European countries, reaching number 14 in the Netherlands and number 25 in Spain. Outside Europe, &quot;Reality&quot; charted at number 13 in Australia, number 14 in New Zealand, and number 47 in Japan. In the US, &quot;Reality&quot; peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, failing to replicate the success of &quot;Heathen&quot;, but outperforming &quot;Earthling&quot; and &quot;Hours&quot;.

===Singles===
&quot;Reality&quot; was not supported through conventional single releases. Pegg opines that in the advent of Apple&#x27;s iTunes, which was launched in April 2003, it was &quot;already clear&quot; that CD singles were becoming obsolete. A music video for &quot;New Killer Star&quot; was released as a DVD-only single in the UK, US and other territories on 29 September 2003. An audio-only version was issued as a conventional CD single in Canada, while the full-length album version appeared in Italy; both releases were backed by &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot;. As the debut single, &quot;New Killer Star&quot; received extensive airplay during Bowie&#x27;s television appearances for the album.

&quot;Never Get Old&quot; was first previewed in France as early as June 2003 through a television advertisement for Vittel mineral water that featured Bowie himself. It was also posted online to BowieNet. The song was originally scheduled to be released as the album&#x27;s second single to coincide with Bowie&#x27;s UK tour dates, but it was shelved at the last minute, similar to &quot;Slow Burn&quot; the previous year. Promotional CDs containing an edited version, backed by &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, appeared in Europe while in Britain, the two tracks appeared as digital downloads on Sony Music&#x27;s UK site in November. &quot;Never Get Old&quot; also appeared as a Japanese A-side in March 2004. A mash-up of &quot;Never Get Old&quot; and &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, created by Endless Noise the same month and titled &quot;Rebel Never Gets Old&quot;, appeared in an ad campaign for Audi in America. This release appeared as a conventional single in June and reached number 47 in the UK.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Reality&quot; received largely positive reviews from music critics on release. Like many of the artist&#x27;s most recent releases, several reviewers considered it his best since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, although many made positive comparisons to &quot;Heathen&quot;. A few felt &quot;Reality&quot; was stronger than its predecessor; John Mulvey of &quot;Dotmusic&quot; wrote: &quot;If &quot;Heathen&quot; was a little overpraised by relieved critics, then &quot;Reality&quot; is a more deserving case.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Eric Carr further contested that &quot;what last year&#x27;s &quot;Heathen&quot; implied, and what &quot;Reality&quot; seems to prove, is that... Bowie has finally joined us all in the present, mind-young as ever but old enough not to make a show of it&quot;. He ultimately called the album &quot;pretty good&quot; and believed it cemented his status as a modern artist. John Aizlewood of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; found the album more cohesive than &quot;Heathen&quot; and named it the publication&#x27;s CD of the week. Comparing it to Bowie&#x27;s previous works, he argued that it stands on its own and with &quot;Reality&quot;, the artist has &quot;rediscovered&quot; himself and &quot;regained his dignity&quot;. Several also considered &quot;Reality&quot; a return to form for the artist.

Some critics highlighted the lyrics and vocal performances as showcasing a maturity absent from previous works. Several also commented on the music. In the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, Howard Cohen commended the artist for playing to his musical strengths rather than &quot;hopping aboard some inappropriate youthful bandwagon&quot;. In &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, Tim De Lisle wrote that &quot;this record pulsates with creative vigour&quot;, offering &quot;a gleaming showcase for his voice, or rather voices.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Anthony DeCurtis believed Bowie succeeded in searching for &quot;reality&quot;, to the artist&#x27;s &quot;mixed dismay and amusement&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine complimented the modernisation of Bowie and Visconti&#x27;s former 1970s sound. While he called its predecessor an amalgamation of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; to &quot;Heroes&quot;, he found &quot;Reality&quot; picks up where its predecessor left off, creating a blend of &quot;Heroes&quot; to &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. Compared to &quot;Heathen&quot;, he concluded: &quot;Both records are testaments to the fact that veteran rockers can make satisfyingly classicist records without resulting in nostalgia or getting too comfortable.&quot; Remarking on the lyrics, Ryan Lenz of &quot;Associated Press&quot; described the album as &quot;an exercise in introspection&quot; and analysed &quot;Reality&quot; as not &quot;a vehicle for commentary on contemporary times&quot;, but rather encapsulating an artist &quot;nearing 60 and finding the world disappointingly clear and never what it seemed&quot;.
Several reviewers praised the album as a whole. &quot;Uncut&quot; Chris Roberts hailed &quot;Reality&quot; as &quot;a very, very good sexy-angst album&quot; filled with &quot;lovely, left-handed songs, rich with unexpected angles, daring detours and words which muse over mortality yet emerge seeming upbeat&quot;, further summarising the lyrics as &quot;mournful&quot; and the music as &quot;euphoric&quot;. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; described the album as a &quot;satisfying, chunk solidity of songs&quot; that starts well but ends poorly. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised &quot;Reality&quot; as &quot;touching [and] intelligent&quot; and that it &quot;gels unexpectedly well&quot;. Reviewing &quot;Reality&quot; for the BBC, Darryl Easlea enjoyed it as &quot;direct, warm, emotional[ly] honest [...] [as well as] rather lively and convincing&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; Kitty Empire cited &quot;how wonderfully unforced it all sounds&quot; as the album&#x27;s defining feature. Although she found it inferior to the artist&#x27;s Berlin-era works, she said &quot;Reality&quot; stands as &quot;the first sequence of Bowie songs that bears repeated listening in years&quot;, concluding that &quot;it is a pleasure, rather than a grim duty done out of respect for the memory of Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Citing individual tracks, many praised the covers of &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; and &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s writer Thom Jurek even argued the two renditions &quot;[distinguish] this set more than anything else&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; writer Mim Udovitch praised Visconti&#x27;s production as &quot;impeccable&quot; and remarked on the sense of immediacy that &quot;makes you feel that Mr. Bowie and his spectacularly hard-rocking band might be about to materialize in your living room ready for an encore&quot;.

Some reviewers expressed more mixed assessments. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Mark Weingarten cited the production as continuing to hinder Bowie&#x27;s work since &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, but nevertheless called the writing an improvement over his previous records. In &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, Marc Savlov contended that &quot;While &quot;Reality&quot; isn&#x27;t a failure by anyone&#x27;s standards, there&#x27;s precious few moments that you can recall, much less hum, an hour after listening to it.&quot;

==Tour==
Bowie embarked on a world tour to support &quot;Reality&quot; that became his most extensive tour since the mid-1990s and, in terms of individual dates, the longest tour of his career. Labelled &quot;A Reality Tour&quot;, Pegg states that &quot;the indefinite article emphasi[ses] the album&#x27;s dalliance with the notion that there can be no absolute definition of reality.&quot; The same musicians as the Heathen Tour and &quot;Reality&quot;—Slick, Garson, Dorsey, Russell and Campbell—returned for the new shows, with Leonard taking Plati&#x27;s place as bandleader. Rehearsals began in July 2003. The band spent most of late-August and September 2003 playing various gigs to promote the upcoming release of &quot;Reality&quot;; the first official show occurred in Copenhagen on 7 October.

The tour&#x27;s shows were more theatrical compared to preceding tours, being dominated by LED lights, raised catwalks and staircases. The setlist contained a variety of material across Bowie&#x27;s entire career, ranging from classic hits to more obscure tracks. Songs from both &quot;Reality&quot; and &quot;Heathen&quot; were included, while tracks like &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1979) made their live debut, and others like &quot;Loving the Alien&quot; (1984) were given radical reworkings. The band also swapped out songs throughout the shows and by the start of 2004, they had performed over 50 songs total.

A Reality Tour received critical acclaim throughout its run; Pegg described it as one of his best concert tours. Two shows in Dublin were later released in 2004 and 2010 on the &quot;A Reality Tour&quot; live album and DVD. However, the tour suffered several setbacks throughout its duration, including the cancellation or postponement of shows in late 2003 due to Bowie contracting laryngitis and influenza, and even the death of a lighting technician in May 2004. On 23 June, Bowie was forced to end the show early due to what medical personnel deemed a pinched shoulder nerve. Although he was back on stage two days later, his condition worsened and on 30 June, all 14 remaining dates were cancelled and A Reality Tour became his final concert tour.

==Aftermath and legacy==

In July 2004, it was revealed that Bowie had suffered a heart attack backstage and underwent a procedure known as angioplasty. Following the incident, Bowie largely withdrew from the public eye. Over the following years, he was spotted at local New York venues and made occasional appearances at concerts by artists including Arcade Fire and David Gilmour, with his final live public performance taking place in November 2006. He occasionally contributed to various studio recordings by artists such as TV on the Radio and Scarlett Johansson, but did not release another studio album until &quot;The Next Day&quot; in 2013, making &quot;Reality&quot; his final album of original material for ten years.

&quot;Reality&quot; has attracted generally positive assessments in subsequent years. In his 2005 book &quot;Strange Fascination&quot;, Buckley argues the album lacks both a &quot;coherent musical identity&quot; and &quot;any thematic trajectory&quot;, furthermore observing a general feeling of &quot;laxity&quot; and underwritten songs, with the songs ranging from &quot;good to merely pleasant&quot;, and &quot;around a third&quot; seeing Bowie &quot;near top form&quot;. Perone considers it a &quot;strong album&quot; and one that does have consistent themes throughout. The author Paul Trynka writes that the record proves that, with the likes of tracks like &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot;, Bowie &quot;has the potential to conjure up pleasures as yet unknown&quot;. Marc Spitz, writing before the release of &quot;The Next Day&quot;, found it worthy as a swan song to Bowie&#x27;s long career. Following that album&#x27;s release, however, O&#x27;Leary argues that &quot;Reality&quot; reestablished itself as &quot;a minor album whose songs were built to be blasted on stage&quot;. The covers have also continued to receive praise.

In &quot;The Complete David Bowie&quot;, Pegg states that one of the album&#x27;s successes is that it emerges with a &quot;reinvigorated sense of rock attack&quot; following the &quot;delicate, self-consciously artful[ness]&quot; of its predecessor, equating both records to the relationships between &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, or &quot;Outside&quot; (1995) and &quot;Earthling&quot;. Further comparing the two albums, he says &quot;Reality&quot; offers &quot;less complexity and fewer sonic layers&quot; than &quot;Heathen&quot; in exchange for &quot;a greater abundance of catchy hooks and buoyant pop-rock atmospherics&quot;. He also argues that &quot;Reality&quot; loses none of its predecessor&#x27;s &quot;artistic sensibility&quot; and &quot;its lasting value lies not just in its infectious melodies and evocative lyrics, but in the exquisitely judged oddness of its sonic textures&quot;. In 2016, Bryan Wawzenek of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Reality&quot; at number 16 out of 26 in a list ranking Bowie&#x27;s studio albums from worst to best, praising Bowie&#x27;s comfortability on the record. Including Bowie&#x27;s two albums with Tin Machine, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Reality&quot; number 24 out of 28 in a 2018 list, with Pat Levy calling it &quot;a decent record in the pantheon of Bowie, nothing more, nothing less&quot;.

<text>In the kidney, the loop of Henle () (or Henle&#x27;s loop, Henle loop, nephron loop or its Latin counterpart ansa nephroni) is the portion of a nephron that leads from the proximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule. Named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, the loop of Henle&#x27;s main function is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney.

By means of a countercurrent multiplier system, which uses electrolyte pumps, the loop of Henle creates an area of high urea concentration deep in the medulla, near the papillary duct in the collecting duct system. Water present in the filtrate in the papillary duct flows through aquaporin channels out of the duct, moving passively down its concentration gradient. This process reabsorbs water and creates a concentrated urine for excretion.

==Structure==
The loop of Henle can be divided into four parts:
*Thin descending limb of loop of Henle
:The thin descending limb has low permeability to ions and urea while being highly permeable to water. The loop has a sharp bend in the renal medulla going from descending to ascending thin limb.
*Thin ascending limb of loop of Henle
:The thin ascending limb is impermeable to water, but it is permeable to ions.
*Ascending limb of loop of Henle
:Sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−) ions are reabsorbed from the urine by secondary active transport by a Na–K–Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). The electrical and concentration gradient drives more reabsorption of Na+, as well as other cations such as magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+).
*Cortical thick ascending limb
:The cortical thick ascending limb drains urine into the distal convoluted tubule.
The tissue type of the loop is simple squamous epithelium. The &quot;thick&quot; and &quot;thin&quot; terminology does not refer to the size of the lumen, but to the size of the epithelial cells. The loop is also sometimes called the nephron loop.

===Blood supply===

The loop of Henle is supplied by blood in a series of straight capillaries descending from the cortical efferent arterioles. These capillaries (called the vasa recta; &quot;recta&quot; is from the Latin for &quot;straight&quot;) also have a countercurrent multiplier mechanism that prevents washout of solutes from the medulla, thereby maintaining the medullary concentration. As water is osmotically driven from the descending limb into the interstitium, it readily enters the capillaries. The low bloodflow through the vasa recta allows time for osmotic equilibration, and can be altered by changing the resistance of the vessels&#x27; efferent arterioles.

As well, blood in the vasa recta still has large proteins and ions which were not filtered through the glomerulus. This provides an oncotic pressure for ions to enter the vasa recta from the interstitium.

The main function of the loop of Henle is to set up a concentration gradient.

==Physiology==
The descending loop of Henle receives isotonic (300 mOsm/L) fluid from the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The fluid is isotonic because as ions are reabsorbed by the gradient time system, water is also reabsorbed maintaining the osmolarity of the fluid in the PCT. Substances reabsorbed in the PCT include urea, water, potassium, sodium, chloride, glucose, amino acids, lactate, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Since water is also reabsorbed the volume of fluid in the loop of Henle is less than the PCT, approximately one-third of the original volume.

The interstitium of the kidney increases in osmolarity outside as the loop of Henle descends from 600 mOsm/L in the outer medulla of the kidney to 1200 mOsm/L in the inner medulla. The descending portion of the loop of Henle is extremely permeable to water and is less permeable to ions, therefore water is easily reabsorbed here and solutes are not readily reabsorbed. The 300 mOsm/L fluid from the loop loses water to the higher concentration outside the loop and increases in tonicity until it reaches its maximum at the bottom of the loop. This area represents the highest concentration in the nephron, but the collecting duct can reach this same tonicity with maximum ADH effect.

The ascending limb of the loop of Henle receives an even lower volume of fluid and has different characteristics compared to the descending limb. In the ascending portion, the loop becomes impermeable to water and the cells of the loop actively reabsorb solutes from the luminal fluid; therefore water is not reabsorbed and ions are readily reabsorbed. As ions leave the lumen via the Na–K–Cl symporter and the Na–H antiporter, the concentration becomes more and more hypotonic until it reaches approximately 100–150 mOsm/L. The ascending limb is also called the diluting segment of the nephron because of its ability to dilute the fluid in the loop from 1200 mOsm/L to 100 mOsm/L.

Flow of the fluid through the entire loop of Henle is considered slow. As flow increases, the ability of the loop to maintain its osmolar gradient is reduced. The vasa recta (capillary loops) also have a slow flow as well. Increases in vasa recta flow wash away metabolites and cause the medulla to lose osmolarity as well. Increases in flow will disrupt the kidney&#x27;s ability to form concentrated urine.

Overall the loop of Henle reabsorbs around 25% of filtered ions and 20% of the filtered water in a normal kidney. These ions are mostly Na+, Cl−, K+, Ca2+ and HCO3−. The powering force is the Na/K-ATPase on the basolateral membrane which maintains the ion concentrations inside the cells. On the luminal membrane, Na enters the cells passively; using the Na–K–Cl symporter. Then the Na/K-ATPase will pump 3 Na out into the peritubular fluid and 2 K into the cell on the non-lumen side of the cell. This gives the lumen of the fluid in the loop a positive charge in comparison and creates a Na concentration gradient, which both push more Na into the cell via the Na–H antiporter. The hydrogen ion for the antiporter comes from the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which takes water and carbon dioxide and forms bicarbonate and a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion is exchanged for the Na in the tubular fluid of the loop of Henle.

==Importance of loop of Henle length==

While the physical shape of the loop of Henle is vital to the creation and maintenance of the medullary gradient, the length imposes a limit to the gradient. In other words, the length of the loop of Henle limits the concentration of the gradient, i.e., the longer the loop, the greater the osmotic gradient. Thus, longer loops would allow for steeper gradients and greater capacity to concentrate urine. Through the countercurrent multiplier the loop of Henle increases the osmolarity of the medulla. 

The loop of Henle is always a U-shaped tubule, with a descending limb and an ascending limb, however its length varies among different vertebrates. This is associated with the fact that it has two functions; whilst the first is to clean wastes, the second is to maintain a balance between ions and H2O. This allows to balance the blood pressure, blood pH and membrane potentials. To achieve such balance between water and ions, the loop of Henle coordinates its function with the collecting duct to regulate the amount of water to reabsorb or to excrete. While the loop of Henle makes the medulla of the kidney salty, the collecting duct regulates the permeability of water that could be reabsorbed to such salty environment. The saltier the medulla, the more water can be reabsorbed from the pre-urine in collecting duct; before it becomes urine. Aquaporin-2 (AQ2) sits in collecting duct and is selectively inserted into cell membranes, according to the body&#x27;s needs, to reabsorb water to create that balance.

Vertebrates who live in the desert do not have access to lots of water. Therefore, some of them have a longer loop of Henle which creates a saltier medulla, leading them to reabsorb more water from the pre-urine. For example, the urine concentration in humans can be as concentrated as 1400 mOsm which is limited by the length of our loop of Henle, i.e., 2.2 mm. While a camel&#x27;s loop of Henle, which is around 4.1 mm, can reach 2800 mOsm. Another example is the Australian mouse whose loop of Henle, 5.2 mm, can make the medulla as salty as 9000 mOsm. This permits that the urine of these rodents can reach 9000 mOsm, in other words, a highly concentrated urine.

<text>The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS) was a British Government agency which ran a variety of auxiliary vessels for His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service (incl. Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Fleet Auxiliary). The service from 2009 has been run by Serco and is known as Serco Marine Services.

==Background==
The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service merged with the former Port Auxiliary Service in 1976 to form a component of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service that was known as marine services. Marine services existed to support the operations of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

In the 1990s, marine services were put out to commercial tender by the Ministry of Defence Warship Support Agency (now absorbed into the Defence Equipment and Support organisation) and by 1996, all tugs, lifting craft, various tenders and management of HMNB Devonport, Portsmouth and Clyde were operated by Serco Denholm.

By the mid 2000s, it was decided that the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service would no longer provide marine services to HM Naval Service, and it would instead be delivered under a Private Finance Initiative instead. Serco were quickly declared preferred bidders and the RMAS was disbanded on 31 March 2008.

==Vessels==
RMAS vessels carried the ship prefix &quot;RMAS&quot; and auxiliary (A) or yard (Y) pennant numbers. They also had a distinctive livery or colour-scheme, namely: black hulls with white beading and buff-coloured upperworks. Below is a list of vessels previously operated by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service. A number of the vessels listed below were later transferred over to Serco Marine Services who continue to provide marine services in support of the Royal Navy.

<doc id="548794" wikidata="Q583658" url="?curid=548794" title="Earthling (album)">
<text>Earthling (stylised as EART HL I NG) is the twenty-first studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 3 February 1997 through RCA Records in the United Kingdom, Virgin Records in the United States, and Arista Records/BMG in other territories. Mostly self-produced by Bowie, it was primarily recorded from August to October 1996 at New York City&#x27;s Looking Glass Studios. Bowie composed the tracks with Reeves Gabrels and Mark Plati, who are credited as co-producers, with Mike Garson, Gail Ann Dorsey and Zack Alford providing overdubs later.

Developing musical styles previously explored on &quot;Outside&quot; (1995), &quot;Earthling&quot; showcases an electronica-influenced sound partly inspired by the industrial and drum and bass culture of the 1990s, further exhibiting jungle and techno styles. Lyrically, the tracks express themes of alienation and spirituality. One of them, &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot;, was remixed for release as a single by Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Trent Reznor, who appeared in its music video. The artwork depicts Bowie wearing a Union Jack coat co-designed by Alexander McQueen.

&quot;Earthling&quot; charted better than its predecessor and reached the top ten in several countries. Its accompanying singles featured numerous remixes and were supported with music videos. Bowie promoted the album through television appearances and on the Earthling Tour in 1997. Although the album was mostly received positively on release, later reviews find &quot;Earthling&quot; lacked innovation in a time when the drum and bass craze was well-established; others consider it a worthwhile addition to an underrated decade. It was reissued with bonus tracks in 2004 and remastered in 2021 for inclusion on the box set &quot;Brilliant Adventure (1992–2001)&quot;.

==Background and recording==
David Bowie supported his 20th studio album &quot;Outside&quot; on the Outside Tour, which ran from September 1995 to February 1996. The lineup for the tour included Reeves Gabrels and Carlos Alomar (guitars), Mike Garson (piano), Zack Alford (drums) and Gail Ann Dorsey (bass). Bowie&#x27;s positive relationship with the new band was the springboard for his next studio record. He told Alan Yentob in 1996: &quot;They&#x27;re probably the most enjoyable set of musicians I&#x27;ve worked with. It&#x27;s the greatest fun and satisfaction I&#x27;ve had with a band since the Spiders.&quot;

A few months after the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Bowie and the band—minus Alomar, who departed due to dissatisfaction—played a series of festivals during the summer from June to July 1996. Gabrels later told the biographer Paul Trynka:

In April 1996, Bowie began recording a new track, &quot;Telling Lies&quot;, alone at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland; it was the last time he worked at Mountain. The song, which expanded on the jungle and drum and bass rhythms found on the &quot;Outside&quot; tracks &quot;I&#x27;m Deranged&quot; and &quot;We Prick You&quot;, made its debut at the summer shows. Speaking with &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in March 1997, Bowie stated: &quot;[I] used it as a blueprint of where I wanted the &quot;Earthling&quot; album to go... We just kept re-moulding it throughout the tour.&quot; Also recorded around May was an untitled piece containing the lyric &quot;dead men don&#x27;t talk&quot; that, like &quot;Telling Lies&quot;, pre-dated the &quot;Earthling&quot; material.

===Initial sessions===

Recording for &quot;Earthling&quot; began in August 1996 shortly after the conclusion of the festival dates. For the location, Bowie chose the composer Philip Glass&#x27;s Looking Glass Studios in New York City. Joining the lineup was the engineer Mark Plati, a New York native who had extensive experience at Looking Glass. Bowie himself mostly self-produced, making it his first self-produced record since &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974). He explained: &quot;I knew exactly what I wanted. We didn&#x27;t have any time to pull in a co-producer... so I just sort of went for it.&quot; Plati and Gabrels were both credited as co-producers, while the former co-wrote several tracks.

Bowie and Gabrels commenced work on &quot;Earthling&quot; with Plati using demos the two had made on the road. The album was recorded entirely on hard disk, allowing instruments and vocals to be cut and pasted at random. While Bowie focused on crafting the lyrics, using an improved version of the cut-up computer program used for &quot;Outside&quot;, Gabrels and Plati focused on the music. Plati recalled: &quot;We were cranking [songs] out one per day. Reeves would be coming up with guitar parts and sounds, I&#x27;d be at the computer recording him or working on the arrangement, and David would be on the couch, writing the lyric. At day&#x27;s end, he&#x27;d do a vocal.&quot; According to Bowie, the trio did not focus on crafting melodies, instead tinkering with the recordings to see which combinations worked and which did not: &quot;Once we developed a kind of mattress, then I would go into the studio and just free-associate against that.&quot; Plati was impressed with Bowie&#x27;s work ethic and recalled that most of his vocal tracks were done in one take. While the sessions were still underway, the band performed four shows on the US East Coast in September 1996, where they premiered &quot;Little Wonder&quot; and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;.

===Overdubs===
The latter half of the sessions focused on overdubs by Garson, Dorsey and Alford. Their contributions were manipulated through various studio effects, such as sampling, looping and distorting; according to the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, Alford is heard more through sped-up loops rather than live tracks. Gabrels also utilised a Roland processor on his guitar which allowed for digital manipulation and alteration. He and Bowie used a technique they previously utilised for &quot;Outside&quot;: transferring bits of guitar to a sampling keyboard and constructing riffs from those pieces. Bowie stated: &quot;It&#x27;s real guitar, but constructed in a synthetic way. But Brian Eno got in the way – in the nicest possible way – so we didn&#x27;t get to that until this album.&quot; Garson was not a fan of the material initially, as he was forced to work with set structures compared to his mostly improvisational role on &quot;Outside&quot;. For the drum tracks, Alford began by working on his own snare patterns at 120 beats per minute (bpm) which were then sped up to 160 bpm, and afterwards improvised on a real kit against the sampled patterns. Bowie&#x27;s primary goal during the sessions was to combine elements of the &quot;technological&quot; and &quot;organic&quot;: &quot;That&#x27;s very much how we treat the album. We kept all sampling in-house and created our own soundscape in a way.&quot;

Unlike &quot;Outside&quot;, the majority of the tracks were written and recorded quickly, with the entire album recorded in about two and a half weeks; Bowie at one point stated it was recorded in eight days. In addition to revamped versions of &quot;Telling Lies&quot; and the &quot;Outside&quot; outtake &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot;, seven new tracks appeared on the final album. Outtakes from the sessions included remakes of the Tin Machine tracks &quot;Baby Universal&quot;, which was played on stage earlier in the year, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Read&quot;, which was replaced by &quot;The Last Thing You Should Do&quot;. According to O&#x27;Leary, &quot;Earthling&quot; was initially envisioned as an EP of new tracks sequenced with the remakes and covers, but by the end of the sessions, there was enough material for a full-length album of new content.

==Music and lyrics==

Compared to the nineteen pieces found on &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;Earthling&quot; contains only nine tracks. Additionally, Bowie stated that he found &quot;Earthling&quot; &quot;primitive&quot; in contrast to the complexity of its predecessor. Musically, the album showcases an electronica-influenced sound partly inspired by the industrial and drum and bass culture of the 1990s. Bowie had previously explored these styles on &quot;Outside&quot;, but fully embraced them for &quot;Earthling&quot;. While reviewers generally consider &quot;Earthling&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;drum and bass album&quot;, the biographer Marc Spitz argues that &quot;it&#x27;s simply [a] case of a veteran artist pursuing a sound with which he or she has fallen in love.&quot; Buckley agrees, further noting that only three or four tracks contain a drum and bass element. Plati later contested:

Characterised by &quot;rapid-fire bass, hailstorm percussion, flashes of distorted guitar, sampling [and] sudden dramatic pauses&quot;, drum and bass rhythms dominate &quot;Little Wonder&quot;, &quot;Battle for Britain (The Letter)&quot;, &quot;Telling Lies&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;. Other reviewers have noted the presence of industrial rock, electronica, hard rock and alternative dance. The author James E. Perone found an emphasis on techno and jungle and deems &quot;Earthling&quot; more musically accessible than its predecessor, partially aided by &quot;strong melodic hooks&quot; throughout. Bowie initially compared the album&#x27;s aggressive sound to 1980&#x27;s &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;. Lyrically, Perone describes the album&#x27;s overall theme as alienation, while Nicholas Pegg says that the lyrics revisit the spiritual themes previously found on &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976), a claim supported by Bowie himself.

===Songs===
&quot;Little Wonder&quot; was one of the first tracks Bowie and Gabrels wrote for the album. Bowie called writing the track a &quot;ridiculous&quot; exercise in pure stream of consciousness: &quot;I just picked &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; and made a line for each of the dwarves&#x27; names. And that&#x27;s the song [laughs]. And then I ran out of dwarves&#x27; names, so there&#x27;s new dwarves in it like &#x27;Stinky&#x27;.&quot; Originally set to be a &quot;nine-minute jungle electronic epic&quot;, the song was trimmed to six minutes for the album. Described by O&#x27;Leary as a combination of arena rock and electronica, it utilises percussion and power chords from the Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;Firestarter&quot;, a 1996 UK number one that assisted in bringing drum and bass rhythms to the mainstream.

&quot;Looking for Satellites&quot; was the second track recorded for the album. In an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot;, Bowie described the track as &quot;A straight, rational piece about where we find ourselves at this particular point in this era: somewhere between religion and technology, and not quite sure where to go next. It&#x27;s kind of a poignant feeling, standing alone on a beach at night looking for a satellite... but what you&#x27;re really looking for is an answer.&quot; It features various cut-up lyrics that were influenced by the then-recent discovery of the possibility of life on Mars. Bowie considered the lyrics &quot;measuring the distance between the crucifixion and flying saucers&quot;. The atmosphere is said by Pegg to contain &quot;wistful uncertainty&quot;. Gabrels&#x27; guitar solo, pieced together from multiple takes, was added in the last minute at Bowie&#x27;s insistence.

According to Plati, &quot;Battle for Britain (The Letter)&quot; was an &quot;attempt to do a jazz-tinged jungle track&quot;. He believed the song brought focus to the album, wherein the structures would resemble &quot;actual songs [instead of] intense atmospheres&quot;. Characterised by various loops and distortion, the lyrics discuss Bowie&#x27;s uncertainty about his own British identity, as he had not lived in the UK for two decades. The music combines techno and the alternative rock of Tin Machine, with vocal melodies and harmonies reminiscent of, in Perone&#x27;s words, &quot;a 1966 or 1967 British rock band&quot;. For the piano solo, Bowie challenged Garson to play a part based on an Igor Stravinsky piece, which he interpreted after hearing it played on a CD.

Inspired by Heinrich Harrer&#x27;s autobiography of the same name, the lyrics of &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; reflect the Chinese takeover of Tibet. It began as a Gabrels&#x27; composition titled &quot;Brussels&quot; and was almost scrapped by Bowie before Gabrels intervened; Bowie later described it as his favourite track on the album. Musically, the song presents a mix of genres such as new wave, grunge and R&amp;B. According to Pegg, it is characterised by saxophone riffs, shrieking guitars, various loops and treated vocals and synthesisers.
Bowie described &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; as his homage &quot;to rock and roll that is still young while we are all growing old&quot;. As such, the lyrics reflect his thoughts on aging at this point in his career. It initially began as a tribute to the actress Susan Sarandon, but took additional influences from songwriter Neil Young after Bowie, Gabrels and Dorsey performed at a pair of benefit concerts for the artist in October 1996. The music is, in Perone&#x27;s words, &quot;largely conventional dance&quot;, featuring atonal piano, sequenced keyboards and electric guitar and containing elements of Latin dance music and jazz; Pegg describes the song as &quot;modern rock&quot;. According to Plati, the song took five days to mix: &quot;It [began] completely programmed and by the time it&#x27;s finished it&#x27;s completely live.&quot;

&quot;Telling Lies&quot; originated during the &quot;Outside&quot; sessions. While Bowie recorded most of the track alone in April, he polished the lyrics during the actual sessions, while the band added overdubs. Both the music and lyrics represent a hybridisation of the &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Earthling&quot; styles, with Pegg describing the final arrangement as a blend of &quot;a very aggressive rock sound with drum and bass&quot;. Perone finds a mix of dance and alternative rock styles that is less successful than other &quot;Earthling&quot; tracks. The lyrics also feature more rhyme than other tracks, delving into topics such as gossip, exaggerations and lying. On 11September 1996, Plati&#x27;s &quot;Feelgood Mix&quot; of the song was released on the internet, reportedly receiving 250,000 downloads. With this release, Bowie became the first artist to release a downloadable track through the internet. Additional remixes by A Guy Called Gerald (the &quot;Paradox Mix&quot;) and Adam F were released the same month.

&quot;The Last Thing You Should Do&quot; was one of the final tracks recorded for the album, primarily built using, in O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s words, &quot;discarded overdub bits&quot;. Gabrels insisted on including it on the album over the Tin Machine remakes, explaining: &quot;Because I co-wrote both of those T.M. songs, that meant I could stand on the higher moral ground, as I was fighting against my own offspring.&quot; He argued that the track turned &quot;Earthling&quot; &quot;from a ten-song album pastiche... to a nine-song cohesive statement&quot;. The music is primarily jungle with bits of techno, while the lyrics discuss the lack of humour and self-love in the late 20th-century. Bowie himself compared the song&#x27;s music to &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; from his 1977 album &quot;Low&quot;. O&#x27;Leary considers it a &quot;miniature&quot; version of the remaining tracks and, in the context of the entire album, Perone argues the song is more successful as a standalone track.

&quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; was originally recorded during the &quot;Outside&quot; sessions as &quot;Dummy&quot;, featuring different lyrics; this version was released on the soundtrack for the 1995 film &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Bowie stated: &quot;That was something that Eno and I put together, and I just didn&#x27;t feel it fit &quot;Outside&quot;, so it didn&#x27;t go on it. It just got left behind. So then we took just the embryo of it, and restructured it with this band.&quot; Described by Bowie as &quot;one of those stereotypical &#x27;Johnny&#x27; songs: Johnny does this, Johnny does that&quot;, the &quot;Earthling&quot; version contains revised lyrics, additional overdubs from the band and transposed verses. Plati explained: &quot;We pulled things off several different reels to make this new composite. It as quite a clean-up job, not the most enjoyable.&quot; Musically, the song mixes techno styles of the 1980s and 1990s while lyrically, it presents a critique of America, in line with Bowie&#x27;s 1975 track &quot;Young Americans&quot;.

&quot;Law (Earthlings on Fire)&quot; was the first track recorded during the sessions. Musically, the song is unlike jungle and more, in O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s words, &quot;industrial trash-pop&quot;. Pegg describes it as a club track reminiscent of the &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; track &quot;Pallas Athena&quot; (1993), featuring various synthesiser effects with a dance-style bassline; Plati compared it to a sound collage. The lyrics convey existential concerns, using obscure references such as a quote from polymath Bertrand Russell. Pegg considers it the album&#x27;s weakest track, while Perone believes it works best as commentary on the &quot;end-of-the-millenium sense of malaise&quot; rather than as a standalone Bowie track.

==Title and packaging==
The album title was chosen by fans at a performance in Roseland, New York during the September 1996 tour; Bowie asked the audience if the upcoming album should be titled &#x27;Earthling&#x27; or &#x27;Earthlings&#x27;. Bowie stated that &quot;it was supposed to describe the Earth; man and his pure habitat on Earth. And I suppose the irony isn&#x27;t lost on me that it&#x27;s sort of me in maybe my most worldly kind of human guise to date.&quot;
The artwork was first conceptualised during the sessions. It portrays Bowie, back-facing the camera, wearing a tattered Union Jack coat with his hands behind his back, looking out towards the green plains of England. The photograph was taken by Frank Ockenfels in New York, which was sent to the computer designer Dave De Angelis in England, who created the final cover. The idea for the coat originated from Gavin Turk&#x27;s 1995 exhibit &quot;Indoor Flag&quot;. The coat, which Bowie wore for the summer festivals, the &quot;Earthling&quot; cover and later the VH1 Fashion Awards in 1997, was co-designed by Bowie and Alexander McQueen. Bowie explained: &quot;[It&#x27;s] the ultimate anti-icon. A retelling of the British flag joke, again torn and stained... the tatty remains of a metaphysical empire.&quot; Pegg compares Bowie&#x27;s Colossus of Rhodes-like stance in the cover to a &quot;proud eighteenth-century landowner in a Gainsborough portrait&quot; and, simultaneously, an alien-like visitor in an effect similar to the sleeve for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (1972). According to Gabrels, Bowie&#x27;s intention for the cover was to realign himself with England.

The Union Jack&#x27;s appearance on the cover has generated commentary from Bowie&#x27;s biographers. Buckley writes that over the past thirty years in Britain, the Union Jack had gone from being symbols of confidence in the 1960s, oppression in the 1970s through the punk rock movement, and &quot;rightist&quot; through Morrissey&#x27;s controversial use of it at Finsbury Park in the early 1990s. Pegg notes that the 1990s Britpop era frequently saw the use of the Union Jack in advertisements, while numerous bands at the time posed with the flag for both &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;. Following &quot;Earthling&quot;″s release, the Union Jack became fashionable and was worn by artists including Eurythmics and the Spice Girls.

The &quot;Earthling&quot; CD package was presented with an elaborate, electronically manipulated photo collage of Bowie and the band members. Additional images included with the sleeve dated back to Bowie&#x27;s Los Angeles period in the mid-1970s, such as a blurred flying saucer and a Kirlian photograph of his fingertip and crucifix, which also appeared on the &quot;Little Wonder&quot; CD single. Pegg attributes Bowie&#x27;s desire for the photographs to his then-cocaine addiction.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Earthling&quot; was preceded by the release of two singles. The first, &quot;Telling Lies&quot; backed by three remixes, was released on 4November 1996. It peaked at number 76 and 79 in Britain and Scotland, respectively, although its distribution was limited to 3,500 copies. The second, &quot;Little Wonder&quot; backed by three remixes, was issued on 27January 1997. The single was a success, peaking at number 14 in the UK and topping the chart in Japan. The accompanying music video was directed by Floria Sigismondi and depicts Bowie at three different ages. Buckley considers it a dance-oriented video rather than a rock one, reminiscent of Orbital&#x27;s &quot;The Box&quot; (1996).

&quot;Earthling&quot; was released on 3February 1997 on CD and LP formats through RCA Records in the UK, Virgin Records in the US, and Arista Records and its parent distributor BMG elsewhere. The Japanese CD included the &#x27;Adam F Mix&#x27; of &quot;Telling Lies&quot; as a bonus track. RCA stressed the album&#x27;s accessibility in their marketing campaign; marketing director Kristina Kyriacou said: &quot;It&#x27;s a lot more commercial than [Bowie&#x27;s] recent albums and we believe that it has a great deal of longevity. &quot;Earthling&quot; is a very dynamic, bold statement and we aim to reflect that.&quot; The album sold modestly, but performed better than its predecessor, reaching number six on the UK Albums Chart and number 39 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also reached number five in Belgian Wallonia and Sweden, and the top ten in France and Scotland. It was nominated for Best Alternative Music Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in 1998, losing to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). Bowie promoted &quot;Earthling&quot; with a string of television appearances from February to April 1997, including on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

Three more singles followed the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; appeared on 14April 1997 on various single formats, some backed by remixes of the track and others featuring remixes of &quot;Outside&quot; tracks. One remix was done by musician Moby, which marked the beginning of Bowie&#x27;s association with the artist. Its music video, again directed by Sigismondi, expanded on the themes of the &quot;Little Wonder&quot; video, featuring appearances from Bowie and Dorsey and, in Pegg&#x27;s words, &quot;flailing choreography&quot;. The band mimed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 25April. The single was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, losing to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Cold Irons Bound&quot; (1997). &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; was released on 18August, backed by a Mandarin version of the song, with lyrics translated by Lin Xi. It failed to reach the UK top 50.

&quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; was issued in the US only on 14October 1997 as a maxi-single, where it was backed by six remixes, some of which featured Ice Cube and Photek. The project was instigated by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, continuing his and Bowie&#x27;s association following the Outside Tour. Reznor, who said he &quot;tried to make it a bit darker&quot;, stripped the production to its roots to create what Buckley calls &quot;an eerie, psychotic track&quot;. Reznor also starred as the titular &#x27;Johnny&#x27; in the Dom and Nic-directed music video, which reflected the song&#x27;s theme of a frightened European in an American city and gave Bowie a nomination for Best Male Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. The single reached number 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remained on the chart for 16 weeks, becoming Bowie&#x27;s biggest hit in the country since &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot; ten years earlier. It also stayed in the Canadian top 50 for six months.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Earthling&quot; received largely positive reviews from music critics on release. Some considered it an improvement over its predecessor. Linda Laban of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; found it a &quot;richly textured return to excellence&quot;, while, in the words of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Greg Kot, it represented &quot;some of [Bowie&#x27;s] finest music in a decade&quot;. Mark Kemp of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered the album Bowie&#x27;s best since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, although he felt the music lacked innovation. Steve Malins of &quot;Q&quot; magazine similarly found &quot;Earthling&quot; &quot;shot through with a gnarly atmospheric chill not encountered since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;&quot;. Multiple reviewers praised the musical experimentation. A writer for &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Earthling&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most inspired, most cutting-edge, and most promising effort since &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; [1983]&quot;. They predicted it would have great chart and Internet success and ultimately considered it &quot;a work of infinite possibilities&quot;. Peter Aspden of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; positively compared &quot;Earthling&quot; to the Prodigy and the Chemical Brothers&#x27; concurrent releases &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; and &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;, respectively, stating that they &quot;were strong on aggression and aural attack, but lacked the variety and subtlety to last beyond twenty-odd interesting minutes&quot;.

Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the music as innovative compared to other jungle and drum and bass acts of the time, stating: &quot;What comes through most strongly on &quot;Earthling&quot; is the way Bowie retains an obsessional interest in the sheer variety and extremity of sound.&quot; He further highlighted Gabrels&#x27; and Garson&#x27;s contributions on &quot;Looking for Satellites&quot; and &quot;Battle for Britain&quot;, respectively. Furthermore, Gill commended Bowie for &quot;offering refined mainstream applications of cutting-edge experimentation&quot; in &quot;Mojo&quot;. In &quot;People&quot; magazine, Peter Castro credited Bowie with striking an &quot;accessible&quot; balance between the &quot;jungle&quot; and rock style akin to &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979) and &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. Dan Deluca of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; similarly wrote that the record succeeded in blending the electronic beats and rhythms with live instrumentation. He ultimately considered it &quot;nervy and energetic&quot; and Bowie&#x27;s finest album &quot;in a diamond dog&#x27;s age&quot;. Nevertheless, he felt that Bowie was &quot;jumping on the electronica bandwagon&quot;. Jason Josephes of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; considered it an artistic rebirth for the artist with a predominately &quot;classic Bowie&quot; style.

Other reviewers expressed more mixed assessments. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan concluded that the majority of the tracks lacked cohesiveness to elevate the album as one of Bowie&#x27;s classics. In &quot;NME&quot;, Jazz Mulvey found &quot;Earthling&quot; more rushed than &quot;Outside&quot; and found the project clumsy and pretentious overall, and felt that Bowie, once at the cutting edge of musical innovation, was now trying to keep up. Although he welcomed it as another addition to Bowie&#x27;s catalogue, he concluded: &quot;It&#x27;s not the future, but it&#x27;s pretty fine.&quot; In a more negative evaluation, Carol Clerk and Andre Paine, writers of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, included &quot;Earthling&quot; on their list of Bowie albums &quot;best to avoid&quot;. In a particularly scathing review, &quot;Select&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ian Harrison gave the album one star out of five, writing: &quot;&quot;Earthling&quot; is splendidly coiffured and presented...but the selling point – Bowie goes original junglist nutty – is so negligible as to be non-existent. And what remains is not good.&quot;

==Tour==
Rehearsals for the Earthling Tour began in mid-April 1997. The band was composed of Bowie, Gabrels, Dorsey, Alford and Garson. When asked by &quot;Q&quot; about his thoughts regarding touring, Bowie stated: &quot;Honestly, it would be a sin not playing live when I&#x27;ve got a band like this. They&#x27;re the best group I&#x27;ve had in twenty years, right up there with the Spiders in terms of cohesive musicianship and attitude.&quot; After performing two shows at the Hanover Grand in London in early June, the tour commenced on 7 June and concluded on 7 November 1997.

Pegg says the shows were &quot;less stagey&quot; than the Outside Tour, although elaborate light shows, costume designs and visual aids were present. The setlist throughout the tour included more well-known hits than its predecessor, while all tracks from &quot;Earthling&quot; except &quot;Law (Earthlings on Fire)&quot; were performed. Initially, the tracks were split into conventional &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;drum and bass&quot; sets. Later on, they were interspersed throughout the setlists. British reviewers, such as &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, praised the shows in general but were initially critical of the &quot;Earthling&quot; material, although the latter reversed its opinion by July. Chris Roberts of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine praised Bowie&#x27;s presence on stage, although he criticised the show&#x27;s second half.

In July, the band appeared at the Phoenix Festival where they played as &quot;Tao Jones Index&quot; in the Radio 1 Dance tent. They later released remixed versions of &quot;Pallas Athena&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; track &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot; (1977) as a single under the name in August. At the festival, Bowie approached electronic duo Orbital for a possible collaboration, although this never came to fruition; member Phil Hartnoll later considered it &quot;the biggest disappointment of [his] career&quot;. The Phoenix Festival performance was later released as a live album in 2021 titled &quot;Look at the Moon! (Live Phoenix Festival 97)&quot;, as part of the series &quot;Brilliant Live Adventures&quot; (2020–2021).

Changes were made to the setlist for the tour&#x27;s American leg, which began in August. The band primarily played at small clubs rather than large venues for commercial reasons, according to Buckley. Performances during the leg were broadcast on various television stations throughout the rest of the year. Additionally, live performances from the entire year and other tracks were compiled for &quot;Earthling in the City&quot; (1997), a six-track promotional CD that was included with the November 1997 American issue of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. While Bowie planned to release a live album from the tour, the idea was vetoed by Virgin. Tracks from the project were later released in 1999 to BowieNet subscribers as &quot;LiveAndWell.com&quot;, which was officially issued in 2021 as part of the &quot;Brilliant Live Adventures&quot; series.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Throughout 1997, Bowie garnered attention when he earned substantial wealth through the sale of &quot;Bowie Bonds&quot;, a celebrity bond that was issued against Bowie&#x27;s future royalties from his back catalogue over the next ten years. Bowie was the first rock musician to engage in such a deal, predating future endeavors by artists such as Elton John, and it earned him $55 million. He also earned an additional $28.5 million upon selling his back catalogue to EMI, who subsequently began a &quot;Best of...&quot; reissue campaign. In November 1997, Bowie performed on the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need charity single &quot;Perfect Day 97&quot;, which became a UK number-one single. In 1998, Bowie retreated from the spotlight, but nevertheless continued recording and making film appearances. He also reconciled with his former collaborator Tony Visconti. In late 1998, Bowie and Gabrels spent time in Bermuda, composing tracks for his next album &quot;Hours&quot; (1999).

In 2018, Gabrels considered &quot;Earthling&quot; his favourite collaboration with Bowie, telling &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine: &quot;We did have a sense while we were doing it that we were making something we hadn&#x27;t heard.&quot; Other artists have spoken positively of the record. Robert Smith later stated: &quot;I really liked &quot;Earthling&quot;. I thought it was a really good album. The songs are great songs. They really stand up to be listened to AS songs and the fact that he worked in a particular genre and tried to capture a certain sound is neither here nor there. The songs are really well put together.&quot; Mark Guiliana cited Alford&#x27;s drum work on &quot;Earthling&quot; as the primary inspiration for his drum patterns on Bowie&#x27;s final album &quot;Blackstar&quot; (2016).

===Retrospective appraisal===
Retrospective reviews of &quot;Earthling&quot; have been mixed. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticised the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;awkward&quot;, writing that &quot;the record frequently sounds as if the beats were simply grafted on top of pre-existing songs&quot;. He further called the songs formulaic and the album itself as ultimately underwhelming. John Davidson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that &quot;Earthling&quot; was the result of Bowie trying to &quot;play catch-up&quot; with the drum and bass explosion of the late 1990s. He called the lyrics Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most obtuse&quot; and, like Erlewine, believed that the drum beats were built around the songs instead of for them. Davidson ultimately states: &quot;&quot;Earthling&quot; is essentially a conventional Bowie rock album (if such a thing be), dressed in baggy dance garb.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Ed Power considered the album a part of the &quot;most underrated phase&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s career and worth a reevaluation among fans. In &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Sean T. Collins, positively compared &quot;Earthling&quot; to &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, calling the record a &quot;muscular collection&quot; that &quot;deserves a place in the pantheon alongside its predecessors.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; placed the album 386th in their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of the 1990s&quot;, noting how Bowie remained an &quot;experimental force&quot; and stating that &quot;&quot;Earthling&quot;″s industrial, drum-and-bass experiments have aged well.&quot;

In lists ranking Bowie&#x27;s studio albums from worst to best, &quot;Earthling&quot; has placed in the middle to low tier. &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed it at number 17 (out of 25 at the time) in 2013. Aaron Lariviere stated: &quot;&quot;Earthling&quot; is nowhere near Bowie&#x27;s best, but it&#x27;s a treat to see the old dog show his teeth after all these years.&quot; Three years later, Bryan Wawzenek of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Earthling&quot; at number 18 out of 26, criticised its emphasis on &quot;sounds over songs&quot; and, like Davidson, found &quot;Bowie being late to yet another sub-genre party&quot;. Nevertheless, he highlighted Bowie&#x27;s energetic performance and the &quot;great soundscapes&quot; on &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot;. The writers of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Earthling&quot; number 22 in their 2018 list.

Bowie&#x27;s biographers have given &quot;Earthling&quot; mixed assessments. Pegg and Spitz argue that, despite being recorded in America and with American musicians, &quot;Earthling&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s most &quot;British&quot; release in twenty years. While Buckley considers it a &quot;hard-hitting and single-minded album&quot; and Christopher Sandford says that there is a lack of innovation but states that &quot;it was a creditable enough bid for relevance by any fifty-year-old.&quot; He also calls &quot;Little Wonder&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most exciting and upbeat single since &#x27;Blue Jean&#x27; [1984]&quot;. Perone finds confusing themes throughout and opinions that the fusion of different musical styles are not always successful. O&#x27;Leary primarily criticises the production, particularly on &quot;Little Wonder&quot;, as sounding dated within a couple of years. On the other hand, Trynka praises &quot;Little Wonder&quot; but criticises the album&#x27;s repetitive nature. He concludes: &quot;The album as a whole is conservative and formulaic. [...] Those faults would have been forgivable had the album been released two years earlier; its appearance just as the nineties drum and bass craze was subsiding suggested Bowie was content to surf on someone else&#x27;s wave rather than make his own.&quot; Reviewing more positively, Pegg writes that its &quot;furious broadside&quot; makes &quot;Earthling&quot; a &quot;very fine album&quot;. He calls it and its predecessor &quot;essential purchases&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most underrated decade&quot;.

===Reissues===
In 2003, Columbia Records reissued &quot;Earthling&quot; on CD, with another reissue following a year later that contained bonus tracks, including 13 remixes, B-sides, alternate takes and live performances from the Earthling Tour. In 2021, the album was remastered and included as part of the box set &quot;Brilliant Adventure (1992–2001)&quot;.

Her keel was laid down on 16 June 1990 by Sevmash. She was launched on 10 December 1994, commissioned on 25 November 1995, and homeported in Gadzhievo. Vepr is armed with four 533 mm torpedo tubes which can use Type 53 torpedoes, RPK-6 or the RPK-2 missiles - older type and Kalibr type armament, naval mines, and four 650 mm torpedo tubes which can use Type 65 torpedoes, or the RPK-7 missile.

==1998 incident==
Shortly before midnight, 10 September 1998, &quot;Vepr&quot; was in port at Severomorsk with crew of its sistership K-461 Volk aboard. Alexander Kuzminykh (), a 19-year-old seaman who was being detained on punishment charges, broke out from his quarters, killed his guard by stabbing him with a chisel, then seized his AKS-74U assault rifle and shot dead five more sailors. He then took two hostages, whom he later killed.

He barricaded himself in the torpedo room, and for 20 hours repeatedly threatened to set a fire to detonate the torpedoes. While &quot;Vepr&quot; had no nuclear weapons and her reactor was shut down, the detonation of her torpedoes while she was tied up at the dock would have ruptured her reactor, creating what the regional director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Vladimir Prikhodko described as &quot;a nuclear catastrophe ... a second Chernobyl.&quot;

Attempts to persuade him to surrender failed. Kuzminykh&#x27;s mother was flown to the naval base but was unable to persuade her son to give himself up. The situation remained a standoff until early on the morning of 12 September, when a special anti-terrorist commando unit of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed the torpedo room. Early reports indicated that he had been killed by the FSB, but later reports indicated that he committed suicide. FSB officers stated that &quot;there was no way to preserve Alexander Kuzminykh&#x27;s life.&quot;

Kuzminykh was found fit when he was conscripted at a St. Petersburg enlistment office, even though he had suffered from a mental disorder and had been inhaling intoxicants. When Kuzminykh volunteered for the submarine service, he passed additional medical and psychiatric tests with high marks. It was later declared that he suffered from a mental illness that was not detected in the draft.

In the aftermath of the incident Russia made efforts to improve recruitment and monitoring of military personnel deployed on nuclear-powered vessels. Only professional, not conscript sailors, could serve on them.

== Refurbishment ==
The submarine was the first of the Akula classes (Project 971 and 971U) to be refurbished. All of them will be equipped to carry the Kalibr type missiles. &quot;Vepr&quot; rejoined the Northern Fleet in March 2020. It is expected to remain in service for another 25–30 years. In July 2022, the submarine was monitored on the surface by NATO naval forces as she transited from the Northern Fleet to the Baltic in company with the Yasen-class submarine Severodvinsk.

<text>Snidely Whiplash is a fictional character who originally appeared as the main antagonist in the &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot; segments of the animated television series &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;. He is the archenemy of Dudley Do-Right. He was listed among the 100 greatest characters in television animation.

The character was voiced by Hans Conried in the original cartoon series. Alfred Molina played Whiplash in the 1999 live-action film version &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot;.

Whiplash is the stereotypical villain in the style of stock characters found in silent films and earlier stage melodrama, wearing black clothing and a top hat and with a handlebar moustache. Whiplash&#x27;s henchman, Homer, usually wears a tuque.

In the cartoon&#x27;s opening segments, Whiplash is seen tying Nell Fenwick to a railroad track. Whiplash is obsessed with tying young women to railroad tracks; he has no reason to do so and realizes no gain, profit or advantage, but is simply compelled to do it.

He is the antithesis of Do-Right, who is the archetype of goodness and a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman (RCMP). On one occasion, typical of producer Jay Ward&#x27;s sense of humor, Whiplash and Do-Right changed hats; Do-Right became the criminal supervillain who actually succeeds at crime and Whiplash became the RCMP hero for capturing the evil Do-Right. This role reversal is repeated in the 1999 film adaptation.

<text>The Royal Danish Air Force () (RDAF) is the aerial warfare force of the Kingdom of Denmark and one of the four branches of the Danish Armed Forces. Initially being components of the Army and the Navy, it was made a separate service in 1950. Its main purpose is to serve as enforcer of Danish airspace and to provide air support to Danish group troops on the battlefield.

==History==

The Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) was formed as a military service independent from the army and navy in 1950 from the merger of the Danish Army Air Corps () founded on 2 July 1912 and the Danish Naval Air Service () which had been founded on 14 December 1911. All military aviation had been prohibited during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1945 and so as of V-E Day the Danish armed forces had no aircraft, but the Luftwaffe had built or expanded air bases in Denmark.

The air force was led by Lieutenant General C.C.J. Førslev, who had previously served as a colonel in the army and as first commander of the Danish Army Air Corps. The national command was located at Værløse Air Base which also served as Command East, while Command West was located at Karup in central Jutland. Royal Air Force volunteer and former member of the Free Norwegian Forces in England, Kaj Birksted, was appointed chief of the flying staff. The rivalries and mutual disrespect between the established officer Førslev, who had never been in air combat himself, and the experienced fighter ace Birksted led to a series of misunderstandings which delayed the operationalization of the air force. Further, the East and West commands lacked experience and knowledge of the newly delivered Gloster Meteor and F-84 Thunderjet aircraft.

The Danish armed forces received 38 surplus Supermarine Spitfire H. F. Mk. IXE and 3 P.R.Mk. XI in 1947–48 plus four additional airframes for ground instruction, which were operated by units of the Hærens Flyvertropper and Marinens Flyvevæsen prior to their merger, and by the Royal Danish Air Force until 1956, when the last examples were retired and all but two scrapped.

One survived for a number of years in a children&#x27;s playground. The one surviving instructional airframe was later restored to depict the number &#x27;401&#x27; Spitfire Mk. IX. This airplane is now preserved at &quot;Dansk Veteranflysamling&quot; at Stauning Airfield in Jutland.

Pilot training was initially based at Avnø from May 1946 until 1951, when the school were transferred to the U.S. under the &quot;Military Assistance Programme&quot;. The school at Avnø continued to conduct tests to choose the candidates for the American training programme. In 1947 the RDAF established a school for aircraft mechanics, based at Værløse Air Base. In 1951, the RDAF officers school was inaugurated at Rungstedlund north of Copenhagen, while airmen were educated at Værløse.
===1950s===
The air force received six F-84E Thunderjet and 238 F-84G Thunderjet as military aid from the US, and formed five new squadrons (726 to 730) at Karup Air Base from 1952 to 1954. The rapid expansion caused problems as neither two-seaters nor flight simulators were available, causing 89 crashed F-84s and 40 pilot casualties. Some casualties were due to the lack of experience in the newly formed air force while others stemmed from the tactics introduced by American WWII and Korean War-veterans based on fast and low flying attacks to avoid anti-aircraft fire.

To avoid further casualties the air force established a training squadron of two-seated T-33As in 1956 to train US-educated pilots to navigate under local weather conditions. Furthermore, Eskadrille 722 was changed to function as rescue squadron in 1956 and was strengthened by seven Sikorsky S-55 helicopters in 1957. Finally, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Saunders from Royal Air Force was employed in 1954 to reorganize the air force which led to the merger of Command East and West, forming Flyvertaktisk Kommando (Air Tactical Command) with the initial mission to lower the number of crashes during training.

===1960s===
In 1962, the Royal Danish Army&#x27;s four SAM batteries based on Nike missiles were transferred to the air force. They were intended to defend Copenhagen against Soviet ballistic missiles and high altitude bombers, and based at Eskadrille 531 in Gunderød, Eskadrille 532 at Kongelunden on Amager, Eskadrille 533 in Sigerslev and Eskadrille 534 in Tune. In 1965 four batteries of Hawk missiles were deployed close to the Nike batteries to protect them from low altitude aircraft.

In 1968, Denmark became the first of three export customers for the Saab 35 Draken (Kite/Dragon). Ever since 1966 the Danish government had started looking for an aircraft to replace two squadrons of Republic RF-84F Thunderflash reconnaissance aircraft and North American F-100 Super Sabre fighter/ground attacker aircraft. A number of candidates were considered and these were: the Douglas A-4F Skyhawk, Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter, Vought A-7 Corsair II, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, Dassault Mirage III/5 and Saab&#x27;s Draken. The F-5 and Mirage 5 were the favourites while the Draken was one of the least popular since it had poor payload/range performance and could not carry heavy weapon loads. In response to the Kongelige Danske Flyvevåben&#x27;s (Royal Danish Air Force&#x27;s) initial dislike, Saab decided to create a new Draken variant that would put it on the top of the competition shortlist.

===1970s===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the RDAF operated a number of US financed Lockheed F-104G Starfighters, North American F-100D and F-100F Super Sabres, and several other types.

The first Danish Draken, designated F35, delivery took place on 1 September 1970 when three F35s were delivered to Karup Air Base. They were later followed by another 17 F35s and six TF35s. Since the F35s lacked radar, they replaced F-100Ds in the ground attack role. However, Sidewinder AAMS could be carried for self-defence. The six trainers were delivered between 1970 and 1972 and the F35s were delivered between 1970 and 1971.

In 1971, the Danish army created the Royal Danish Army Flying Service as the first air-unit outside the air force, since its creation in 1950. It had observation helicopters and piston-engined artillery spotting aeroplanes. In 1977 the Danish Naval Air Squadron was extracted from squadron 722 to the Danish navy, and it had ship-based helicopters. In a joint arms purchase four NATO countries: Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, and Belgium introduced the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon as their common strike fighter in January 1980. The F-16 was later bought by additional NATO countries, Greece and Turkey, and the United States of America, also a NATO member operates the F-16.
===1980s===
In 1982, the number of fighter aircraft was reduced by 12 units. The General Dynamics F-16 was introduced to replace initially the F-100 and later the F-104G. The Royal Danish Naval Air Service was strengthened by eight Westland Lynx Mk. 80 from 1980, replacing the Alouette III helicopters. As a supplement to the Greenland-based C-130s the air force purchased three Gulfstream G-III.

===1990s===

In 1990, the Danish Army Air Corps purchased 12 Eurocopter Fennec lightweight attack helicopters to strengthen capabilities to perform expeditionary mission. The helicopters were transferred to RDAF in 2003.

In 1992, during the Yugoslavian civil wars, the RDAF C-130 Hercules aircraft were used for transport of the 900 Danish troops participating in the UN-led mission to the Balkans. In 1996, a C-130 joined the NATO On-Call International Airlift Pool along with a Gulfstream aircraft. The Gulfstreams were replaced by Challenger planes the following year, when the Danish government ordered the three Challengers in current use.

In 1999, following the end of the Cold War, the Danish air force was re-organised to be an &quot;expeditionary&quot; air force, capable of supporting international operations worldwide – but at the same time still being able to uphold its domestic air and seaward defence commitments. The same year, an expeditionary force of 9 F-16s to join the Operation Allied Force is approved in parliament.

===2000s===
In 2002, Denmark joined the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Team, and eventually up to 48 F-35s could be bought to replace the F-16s.

In October 2002, a tri-national detachment of 18 Danish, Dutch, and Norwegian F-16 fighter-bombers, with one Dutch KC-10 tanker, flew to the Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, in support of the NATO ground forces in Afghanistan as part of the Operation Enduring Freedom.

In 2004, the older C-130H Hercules fleet of three transport aircraft (bought by the government in 1973) was replaced by three of the more-advanced and stretched C-130J transport aircraft. A fourth C-130J joined in 2007.

In 2005, a modification program (Mid Life Update) was completed on the remaining F-16 aircraft. The modification programme, started in 1995, introduced a new mission computer, colour multifunction displays, and other avionic improvements. 

In 2003, 16 H-500 Cayuse and 13 Eurocopter AS550C2 Fennec from the Army Air Corps and eight Westland Lynx Mk. 90B from the Naval Air Squadron were supposed to be transferred to the air force. The 16 Cayuse and 13 Fennec helicopters were transferred to the newly re-formed Danish Squadron 724. The eight Lynx helicopters were supposed to enter another re-formed squadron, &quot;Squadron 728&quot;, but for political reasons those helicopters remained with the Navy. This change of &quot;ownership&quot; of the naval helicopters became effective on 1 January 2011 when the naval helicopters joined the newly formed &quot;Squadron 723&quot;.

In 2005, the 16 Cayuses were decommissioned, and also one of the Fennecs. The remaining 12 Fennecs took over many of the tasks from the Cayuses, including support-functions of the Danish police.

In 2006, the air force signed a letter of intent to purchase several of the Boeing Integrated Defense C-17 Globemaster III. That order needs to be confirmed, but it is to be made on the basis of the formation of a shared NATO C-17 air fleet to support international deployments. Denmark has later withdrawn from this arrangement but it is in existence today. See NATO Strategic Airlift Capability. The United States and the United Kingdom have already bought numerous C-17s, and several other NATO countries are considering doing so, too.
In June 2007, Denmark&#x27;s six EH101 transport helicopters were transferred to the British Royal Air Force to meet an urgent British requirement for additional transport helicopters. In 2009 six replacement AW101 were delivered to the RDAF from AgustaWestland Yeowil and paid for by the UK.

===2010s===
In June 2010, the Sikorsky S-61 SAR helicopter was withdrawn from service.

The Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO), short listed five helicopters as potential replacements for the Lynx with around 12 new naval helicopters needed. The Sikorsky/Lockheed MH-60R, the NH90/NFH, H-92, AW159 and AW101 were on the short list and a Request For Proposal was issued on 30 September 2010. Ultimately the air force decided to buy nine Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters.

In 2014, RDAF flew F-16 fighter jets in Greenland for the first time, testing the operational capabilities of maintaining sovereignty of the vast arctic airspace.

In 2005 the RDAF requested information about the possible procurement of a replacement for the F-16 fighter aircraft from the producers of the Gripen, Rafale, Eurofighter and Joint Strike Fighter, to which the RDAF has been a partner since 1997. Due to this fact Rafale-producer, Dassault Aviation, decided not to participate in the information round as they considered it to be biased towards the JSF option. This also led to the withdrawal of the Eurofighter in 2007, reentering in 2012. Meanwhile, the Boeing F-18 Super Hornet entered the competition in 2008. After several delays, a request for binding information was sent to the four candidates in April 2014 expecting a final decision in mid-2015. On 9 June 2016, the Danish Defence Committee agreed to purchase 27 F-35As to succeed the F-16. The price tag is US$3 billion.

===2020s===
In January 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that assembly had begun on L-001, the first of 27 F-35As destined for the Royal Danish Air Force. The first F-35 was transferred to the Danish Air Force on 7 April 2021.

On 14 September 2023, the first four F-35A fighters arrived at Skrydstrup air base after a transfer flight from Lockheed Martin&#x27;s facilities in the US.

On 6 December 2024, another four F-35A fighters were delivered to the Danish Fighter Wing at Skrydstrup Air Base after departing from the US.

== Structure ==
=== Structure in the late 1980s ===
The Royal Danish Air Force Command was headquartered at Karup Air Base and tasked to train, maintain and prepare the army for war. However operational control in peacetime rested with the Tactical Air Command. In wartime the air force&#x27;s commander would have become the commander of Allied Air Forces Baltic Approaches (AIRBALTAP). AIRBALTAP commanded all flying units, flying reinforcements, all ground-based radar systems and stations, all air defence units and airfields in its sector. In war the entire Royal Danish Air Force would have come under AIRBALTAP.

<text>Titus Fulvius Iunius Macrianus (died 261), also known as Macrianus Minor, was a Roman usurper. He was the son of Fulvius Macrianus, also known as Macrianus Major.

== Career ==

Although his father was from an equestrian family, Macrianus Minor&#x27;s mother was of noble birth and her name, possibly, was Iunia. According to the often unreliable Historia Augusta, he had served as military tribune under Valerian.

Macrianus, his father and his brother Quietus, were in Mesopotamia in 260, for the Sassanid campaign of Emperor Valerian, when the Roman army was defeated, and the emperor was captured. With help from his father, who kept the imperial treasure, and by the influence of Balista, Valerian&#x27;s praefect, Macrianus gained the imperial office together with his brother Quietus, through the election by the army, in contrast with the lawful Emperor Gallienus, son and co-emperor with Valerian, who was far in the West. The two emperors and brothers were recognized in the eastern part of the Empire, having a stronghold in Egypt, the grain supplying province for the city of Rome.

After having temporarily secured the Persian frontier, Macrianus Major and Macrianus Minor moved to the West to attack and eliminate their rival Gallienus. They were however defeated in autumn 261 by Aureolus, and later killed by their own soldiers at the father&#x27;s request.

== Cultural depictions ==
Macrianus appears in Harry Sidebottom&#x27;s historical fiction novel series as one of the series&#x27; antagonists..

<doc id="548826" wikidata="Q855113" url="?curid=548826" title="Wisdom King">
<text>A wisdom king (Sanskrit: विद्याराज; IAST: &quot;vidyārāja&quot;, ) is a type of wrathful deity in East Asian Buddhism.

Whereas the Sanskrit name is translated literally as &quot;wisdom / knowledge king(s),&quot; the term &quot;vidyā&quot; in Vajrayana Buddhism is also specifically used to denote mantras; the term may thus also be rendered &quot;mantra king(s).&quot; &quot;Vidyā&quot; is translated in Chinese with the character (lit. &quot;bright, radiant&quot;, figuratively &quot;knowledge(able), wisdom, wise&quot;), leading to a wide array of alternative translations such as &quot;bright king(s)&quot; or &quot;radiant king(s)&quot;. A similar category of fierce deities known as herukas are found in Tibetan Buddhism.

The female counterparts of wisdom kings are known as wisdom queens (Sanskrit (IAST): &quot;vidyārājñī&quot;, Chinese: 明妃, &quot;Míngfēi&quot;, Japanese: &quot;Myōhi&quot;).

==Overview==
===Development===

&quot;Vidyārājas&quot;, as their name suggests, are originally conceived of as the guardians and personifications of esoteric wisdom (&quot;vidyā&quot;), namely mantras and dharanis. They were seen as embodying the mystic power contained in these sacred utterances.

During the early stages of esoteric (Vajrayana) Buddhism, many of the deities that would become known as &quot;vidyārājas&quot; (a term that only came into use around the late 7th-early 8th century) were mainly seen as attendants of bodhisattvas who were invoked for specific ends such as the removal of misfortune and obstacles to enlightenment. They personified certain attributes of these bodhisattvas such as their wisdom or the power of their voices and were held to perform various tasks such as gathering together sentient beings to whom the bodhisattva preaches, subjugating unruly elements, or protecting adherents of Buddhism. Eventually, these divinities became objects of veneration in their own right; no longer necessarily paired with a bodhisattva, they became considered as the manifestations of the bodhisattvas themselves and/or of buddhas, who are believed to assume terrifying forms as a means to save sentient beings out of compassion for them. A belief prevalent in the Japanese tradition known as the &quot;sanrinjin&quot; (三輪身, &quot;bodies of the three wheels&quot;) theory for instance posits that five Wisdom Kings are the fierce incarnations (教令輪身, &quot;kyōryōrin-shin&quot;, lit. &quot;embodiments of the wheel of injunction&quot;) of the Five Wisdom Buddhas, who appear both as gentle bodhisattvas who teach the Dharma through compassion and as terrifying &quot;vidyārājas&quot; who teach through fear, shocking nonbelievers into faith.
The evolution of the &quot;vidyārāja&quot; will be illustrated here by the deity Yamāntaka, one of the earliest Buddhist wrathful deities. In the 6th century text &quot;Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa&quot;, Yamāntaka is portrayed as the oath-bound servant of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī who assembles all beings from across the world to hear the Buddha&#x27;s preaching and vanquishes (and converts) those who are hostile to Buddhism; at the same time, Yamāntaka is also the personification of Mañjuśrī&#x27;s dharani, the benefits of which are identical to his abilities. He was also commonly depicted in statuary along with Mañjuśrī as a diminutive yaksha-like attendant figure.
Later, as Yamāntaka and similar subordinates of various bodhisattvas (e.g. Hayagrīva, who was associated with Avalokiteśvara) became fully independent deities, they began to be portrayed by themselves and increasingly acquired iconographic attributes specific to each. Yamāntaka for instance is commonly shown with six heads, arms, and legs and riding or standing on a buffalo mount. The status and function of these deities have shifted from being minor emissaries who gather together and intimidate recalcitrant beings to being intimately involved in the primary task of esoteric Buddhism: the transformation of passions and ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;) into compassion and wisdom. As a result of this development, the relationship between Mañjuśrī and Yamāntaka was recontextualized such that Yamāntaka is now considered to be the incarnation of Mañjuśrī himself (so the &quot;Mañjuśrī-nāma-samgīti&quot;). Eventually, in the &quot;sanrinjin&quot; interpretation of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, both Yamāntaka and Mañjuśrī - under the name &#x27;Vajratīkṣṇa&#x27; (Japanese: 金剛利菩薩, &quot;Kongōri Bosatsu&quot;) - became classified as avatars of the buddha Amitābha.

Other Wisdom Kings followed a more or less similar development. Hayagrīva, for example, was originally the horse-headed incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu which was adopted into Buddhism as Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s attendant (although unlike the Hindu Hayagrīva, the Buddhist figure was never portrayed with a horse&#x27;s head, instead being depicted like Yamāntaka as a yaksha who may have a miniature horse head emerging from his hair). Eventually, as Hayagrīva increasingly rose to prominence, the distinction between him and his superior became increasingly blurred so that he ultimately turned into one of Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s many guises in both China and Japan. One of the more famous &quot;vidyārājas&quot;, Acala (Acalanātha), was originally an acolyte or messenger of the buddha Vairocana before he was interpreted as Vairocana&#x27;s fierce aspect or &quot;kyōryōrin-shin&quot; in the Japanese tradition. (In Nepal and Tibet, meanwhile, he is instead identified as the incarnation of either Mañjuśrī or the buddha Akṣobhya.)

==Iconography==
The iconography of Buddhist wrathful deities are usually considered to be derived from both yaksha imagery and Shaivite iconography, specifically from the wrathful forms of the Hindu god Shiva (e.g. Bhairava).

Wisdom Kings are usually represented as fierce-looking, often with blue or black skin and multiple heads, arms, and legs. They hold various weapons in their hands and are sometimes adorned with skulls, snakes or animal skins and wreathed in flames. This fiery aura is symbolically interpreted as the fire that purifies the practitioner and transforms one&#x27;s passions into awakening, the so-called &quot;fire &quot;samadhi&quot;&quot; (火生三昧, Japanese: &quot;kashō-zanmai&quot;).

Certain &quot;vidyārājas&quot; bear attributes that reflect the historical rivalry between Hinduism and Buddhism. For instance, the Wisdom King Trailokyavijaya is shown defeating and trampling on the deva Maheśvara (one of the Buddhist analogues to Shiva) and his consort Umā (Pārvatī). A commentary on the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; by the Tang monk Yi Xing meanwhile attributes the taming of Maheśvara to another &quot;vidyārāja&quot;, Acala. Acala himself is sometimes shown trampling on an elephant-headed demon/deity who may share a common origin with the Hindu Ganesha named Vighnarāja (the &quot;Lord of Obstacles&quot;) in Tibetan art.

==List of Wisdom Kings==
===The Five Wisdom Kings===
In Chinese and Japanese (Shingon and Tendai) esoteric Buddhism, the Five Great Wisdom Kings (五大明王, Jp. &quot;Godai Myōō&quot;; Ch. &quot;Wǔ Dà Míngwáng&quot;), also known as the Five Guardian Kings, are a group of &quot;vidyārājas&quot; who are considered to be both the fierce emanations of the Five Wisdom Buddhas and the guardians of Buddhist doctrine. Organized according to the five directions (the four cardinal points plus the center), the Five Kings are usually defined as follows:

* Acala / Acalanātha (不動明王; Jp. &quot;Fudō Myōō&quot;; Ch. 不動明王, &quot;Bùdòng Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of Mahāvairocana, associated with the center
* Trailokyavijaya (降三世明王; Jp. &quot;Gōzanze Myōō&quot;; Ch. &quot;Xiángsānshì Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of Akṣobhya, associated with the east
* Kuṇḍali / Amṛtakuṇḍalin (軍荼利明王, Jp. &quot;Gundari Myōō&quot;; Ch. &quot;Jūntúlì Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of Ratnasambhava, associated with the south
* Yamāntaka (大威徳明王; Jp. &quot;Daiitoku Myōō&quot;; Ch. &quot;Dàwēidé Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of Amitābha, associated with the west
* Vajrayakṣa (金剛夜叉明王, Jp. &quot;Kongōyasha Myōō&quot;; Ch. &quot;Jīngāng Yèchā Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of Amoghasiddhi, associated with the north in the Shingon school
** Ucchuṣma (烏枢沙摩明王; Jp. &quot;Ususama Myōō&quot;; Ch. &quot;Wūshūshāmó Míngwáng&quot;) - Associated with the north in the Tendai school

===The Eight Wisdom Kings===
In Chinese Buddhism, the Eight Great Wisdom Kings (八大明王; pinyin: &quot;Bā Dà Míngwáng&quot;), is another grouping of Wisdom Kings that is depicted in statues, mural art and paintings. The acknowledged canonical source of the grouping of eight is the &quot;Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa&quot;, the Chinese translation of which (大方廣菩薩藏文殊舍利根本儀軌經; &quot;Dà fāngguǎng Púsà Zàng Wénshūshèlì Gēnběn Yíguǐ Jīng&quot;, lit. &quot;The Fundamental Ordinance of Mañjuśrī&quot;) in about 980-1000 CE is attributed to the monk Tianxizai, who is possibly the north Indian Shantideva. Each of the Wisdom Kings correspond to one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvaszh] in Chinese Buddhism as well as to a specific compass direction.

The Eight Wisdom Kings, with exceptions in certain lists, are usually defined as:
* Acala - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin, associated with the north-east
* Kuṇḍali - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, associated with the north-west
* Trailokyavijaya - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, associated with the south-east
*Mahācakra (大輪明王; Ch. &quot;Dàlún Míngwáng)&quot; - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Maitreya, associated with the south-west
*Padanakṣipa (步擲明王; Ch. &quot;Bùzhì Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, associated with the north
*Aparājita (無能勝明王; Ch. &quot;Wúnéngshēng Míngwáng)&quot; - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, associated with the south
*Yamāntaka - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, associated with the east
*Hayagrīva (馬頭觀音; Ch. &quot;Mǎtóu Guānyīn&quot;) - Manifestation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin), associated with the west

=== The Ten Wisdom Kings ===
Another grouping found in certain Chinese depictions is the Ten Great Wisdom Kings (十大明王; &quot;Shí Dà Míngwáng&quot;). The acknowledged canonical source of the grouping is from &quot;The Sutra of the Liturgy for Brilliant Contemplation of the Ten Wrathful Wisdom Kings of the Illusory Net of the Great Yoga Teachings&quot; (佛說幻化網大瑜伽教十忿怒明王大明觀想儀軌經; &quot;Fóshuō Huànhuàwǎng Dà yújiājiào Shífènnù Míngwáng Dàmíng Guānxiǎng Yíguǐ Jīng)&quot;. There are several different groupings of the ten Kings, which differ in the removal and addition of certain &quot;vidyārājas&quot;, as well as attributing some Kings to different buddhas and bodhisattvas. In medieval and modern Chinese Buddhist practice, the Ten Kings are regularly invoked in repentance ceremonies, such as the Liberation Rite of Water and Land, where they are offered offerings and entreated to expel evil from the ritual platform.

One version of the list of Ten Wisdom Kings are as follows:

* Acala - Manifestation of Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin
* Trailokyavijaya - Manifestation of Vajrapani
*Mahācakra - Manifestation of Maitreya
*Padanakṣipa - Manifestation of Samantabhadra
*Aparājita - Manifestation of Kṣitigarbha
*Yamāntaka - Manifestation of Amitābha
*Hayagrīva - Manifestation of Avalokiteśvara
*Vajrahāsa (大笑明王; Ch. &quot;Dàxiào Míngwáng&quot;) - Manifestation of Ākāśagarbha
*Ucchuṣma (穢跡金剛明王; Ch. &quot;Huìjì Jīngāng Míngwáng&quot;, lit. &quot;Vajra Being of Impure Traces&quot;) - Manifestation of Śakyamuni
*Ucchuṣma (?) (火頭金剛明王; Ch. &quot;Huǒtóu Jīngāng Míngwáng&quot;, lit. &quot;Fire-Headed Vajra Being&quot;) - Manifestation of Mahāvairocana

Another version of the list identifies the ten Kings with different buddhas and bodhisattvas:

*Acala - Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin
*Kuṇḍali - Amitābha
*Trailokyavijaya - Vajrapāṇi
*Mahācakra - Maitreya
*Padanakṣipa - Samantabhadra
*Aparājita - Kṣitigarbha 
*Yamāntaka - Mañjuśrī
*Hayagrīva - Avalokiteśvara
*Vajrahāsa - Ākāśagarbha
*Mahābala (大力明王; Ch, &quot;Dàlì Míngwáng&quot;) - Śakyamuni

===Others===
Other deities to whom the title &quot;vidyārāja&quot; is applied include:

* Rāgarāja (愛染明王; Ch. &quot;Àirǎn Míngwáng&quot;; Jp. &quot;Aizen Myōō&quot;) - A &quot;vidyaraja&quot; considered to transform worldly lust and sexual passion into spiritual awakening; manifestation of the bodhisattva Vajrasattva and/or the buddha Vairochana.

* Mahāmāyūrī (孔雀明王; Ch. &quot;Kǒngquè Míngwáng&quot;; Jp. &quot;Kujaku Myōō&quot;) - A Wisdom Queen (&quot;vidyārājñī&quot;); sometimes also classified as a bodhisattva. Unlike most other &quot;vidyārājas&quot;, s/he is depicted with a benevolent expression.
*Mahākrodharāja (大可畏明王; Ch. &quot;Dàkěwèi Míngwáng&quot;; Jp. &quot;Daikai Myōō&quot;) - Attendant or manifestation of Amoghapasha (不空羂索観音; Ch. &quot;Bùkōng Juànsuǒ Guānyīn&quot;; Jp. &quot;Fukū Kensaku/Kenjaku Kannon&quot;), one of Avalokiteshvara&#x27;s forms.
*Sadākṣara (六字明王; Ch. &quot;Liùzì Míngwáng&quot;; Jp. &quot;Rokuji Myōō&quot;) - A deification of the Sadākṣara (Six-Letter) Sutra Ritual (六字経法; Jp. &quot;Rokuji-kyō hō&quot;), a rite of subjugation focused on the six manifestations of Avalokiteshvara. Unlike other Wisdom Kings but like Mahamayuri, he sports a gentle bodhisattva-like countenance and is shown with four or six arms and standing on one leg.

<text>A presidio (&quot;jail, fortification&quot;) was a fortified base established by the Spanish Empire mainly between the 16th and 18th centuries in areas under their control or influence. The term is derived from the Latin word &quot;praesidium&quot; meaning &quot;protection&quot; or &quot;defense&quot;.

In the Mediterranean and the Philippines, the presidios were outposts of the Christian defense against Islamic raids. In the Americas, the fortresses were built to protect against raids by pirates, rival colonial powers, and Native Americans. 

Later in western North America, with independence, the Mexicans garrisoned the Spanish presidios on the northern frontier and followed the same pattern in unsettled frontier regions such as the Presidio de Sonoma in Sonoma, California, and the Presidio de Calabasas in Arizona.

In western North America, a &quot;rancho del rey&quot; or &quot;king″s ranch&quot; would be established a short distance outside a presidio. This was a tract of land assigned to the presidio to furnish pasturage to the horses and other beasts of burden of the garrison. Mexico called this facility &quot;rancho nacional&quot;.
Presidios were only accessible to Spanish military and soldiers.

They were held by Spain until the War of the Spanish Succession, when they came under Austrian ownership, and were administered from Naples.

The establishment of Spanish military outposts on the North African coast echoed earlier endeavors by the Kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century (and again in Djerba under Frederick III of Sicily) and the Kingdom of France in the 13th century (Eighth Crusade of 1270). During the period of Iberian Union between 1580 and 1640, the Spanish Crown gained Ceuta and the Portuguese outposts on the Atlantic Coast, such as Tangier, Mazagão/El Jadida and Casablanca; but of these, it only retained Ceuta by the Treaty of Lisbon (1668). 

The Spanish North African &quot;presidios&quot; are listed here in geographical sequence, from West to East, and including neither Spain&#x27;s Atlantic settlements in the Moroccan far South (e.g. Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña) nor outposts gained after 1830 (e.g. the Chafarinas Islands).

<text>In Buddhism, wrathful deities or fierce deities are the fierce, wrathful or forceful (Tibetan: &quot;trowo&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;krodha&quot;) forms (or &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;manifestations&quot;) of enlightened Buddhas, Bodhisattvas or Devas (divine beings); normally the same figure has other, peaceful, aspects as well. Because of their power to destroy the obstacles to enlightenment, they are also termed &quot;krodha-vighnantaka&quot;, &quot;Wrathful onlookers on destroying obstacles&quot;. Wrathful deities are a notable feature of the iconography of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, especially in Tibetan art. These types of deities first appeared in India during the late 6th century, with its main source being the Yaksha imagery, and became a central feature of Indian Tantric Buddhism by the late 10th or early 11th century.

==Overview==

In non-Tantric traditions of Mahayana Buddhism, these beings are protector deities who destroy obstacles to the Buddhas and the Dharma, act as guardians against demons and gather together sentient beings to listen to the teachings of the Buddhas. In Tantric Buddhism, they are considered to be fierce and terrifying forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas themselves. Enlightened beings may take on these forms in order to protect and aid confused sentient beings. They also represent the energy and power that is needed in order to transform negative mental factors into wisdom and compassion. They represent the power and compassion of enlightened activity which uses multiple skillful means (upaya) to guide sentient beings as well as the transformative element of tantra which uses negative emotions as part of the path. According to Chogyam Trungpa, &quot;wrathful yidams work more directly and forcefully with passion, aggression, and delusion — conquering and trampling them on the spot.&quot;

In Tantric Buddhist art, fierce deities are presented as terrifying, demonic-looking beings adorned with bone ornaments () such as human skulls and other ornaments associated with the charnel ground, as well as being often depicted with sexually suggestive attributes. According to Rob Linrothe, the sensual and fierce imagery represents &quot;poison as its own antidote, harnessed obstacles as the liberating force&quot; and notes that they are &quot;metaphors for the internal yogic processes to gain enlightenment&quot;.

They often carry ritual implements, or some of the &quot;ashtamangala&quot;, or &quot;Eight Auspicious Symbols&quot;, and are depicted trampling on (much smaller) bodies personifying the &quot;obstacles&quot; that the deity defeats.

==Tantric deities==
===Yidams===

In Indo-Tibetan Vajrayana, Yidams are divine forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The tantric practitioner is initiated into the mandala of a particular meditational deity (Sanskrit: &quot;Iṣṭa-devatā&quot;) and practices complex sadhanas (meditations) on the deity for the purpose of personal transformation. This Deity Yoga practice is central to tantric forms of Buddhism such as Tibetan Buddhism and the Generation stage of the practice is dependent on visualisation based on the vivid iconography associated with their yidam. Yidams can be peaceful, fierce and &quot;semi-fierce&quot; (having both fierce and peaceful aspects), with each category having its own particular set of associated imagery. Fierce deities can be divided into male and female categories. 

The Herukas (Tb. &quot;khrag &#x27;thung&quot;, lit. &quot;blood drinker&quot;) are enlightened masculine beings who adopt fierce forms to express their detachment from the world of ignorance, such as Yamantaka, Cakrasamvara, Mahākāla, Hayagriva, or Vajrakilaya. 

Dakinis (Tb. &quot;khandroma&quot;, &quot;sky-goer&quot;) are their feminine counterparts, sometimes depicted with a heruka and sometimes as independent deities. The most prevalent wrathful dakinis are Vajrayogini and Vajravārāhī. A common form of imagery is the yab-yum of a Buddha and consort in sexual union.

===Wisdom Kings===
In East Asian Buddhism, Wisdom Kings (Sanskrit &quot;vidyarāja&quot;), are seen as divine manifestations of the Buddhas, who act as protectors, messengers, and defenders of the Buddhist Dharma. In East Asian Vajrayana and Chinese Esoteric Buddhism the Five Wisdom Kings are regarded as manifestations of the Five Tathagatas. In Chinese Buddhism, the Eight Wisdom Kings and Ten Wisdom Kings are regarded as manifestations of different bodhisattvas and buddhas.

==Protectors==
The Protectors (Sanskrit &quot;pāla&quot;) or Dharmapāla (Dharma protectors), are powerful beings, often Devas or Bodhisattvas who protect the Buddhist religion and community from inner and outer threats and obstacles to their practice. A Dharmapala can also be a Garuda, Nāga, Yaksha, Gandharva, or Asura. Other categories of Protectors include the Lokapālas or &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; and  or &quot;Protectors of the Region&quot;.

===Eight Dharmapalas===

A common Tibetan grouping of Dharmapāla is &#x27;The Eight Dharmapalas&#x27; (), who are understood to be the defenders of Buddhism. They are supernatural beings with the rank of bodhisattva who &quot;are supposed to wage war without any mercy against the demons and enemies of Buddhism&quot;. The Eight Dharmapala are:

* Yama, the god of death 
* Mahakala, the Great Black One 
* Yamantaka, the conqueror of death
* Vaiśravaṇa or Kubera, the god of wealth 
* Hayagriva, the Horse-necked one
* Palden Lhamo, female protectress of Tibet
* White Brahma or &quot;Tshangs pa&quot;
* Begtse, a war god from Mongolia.

<doc id="548832" wikidata="Q17041388" url="?curid=548832" title="XIT Ranch">
<text>The XIT Ranch was a cattle ranch in the Texas Panhandle which operated from 1885 to 1912. Comprising over 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) of land, it ran for 200 miles (300 km) along the border with New Mexico, varying in width from 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 km). The massive ranch stretched through ten counties in Texas and at its peak regularly handled 150,000 head of cattle. The brand &quot;XIT&quot; was chosen for its difficulty to alter thus thwarting rustlers.

==History==
The XIT ranch was located in the western edge of the Texas Panhandle. This was anciently the territory of the Querecho Indians and Teyas. In 1879, the 16th Texas Legislature appropriated 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) of land to finance a new state capitol. In 1882, in a special legislative session, the 17th Texas Legislature struck a bargain with Charles B. and John V. Farwell of Chicago, Illinois, under which a syndicate led by the Farwells, with mostly British investors, agreed to build a new Texas State Capitol in Austin and to accept the 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) of Panhandle land as payment. The ranch stretched across all or portions of the counties of Dallam, Hartley, Oldham, Deaf Smith, Parmer, Castro, Bailey, Lamb, Cochran, and Hockley. Total expense for the capitol building amounted to $3,744,630.60, of which the Syndicate Company paid $3,224,593.45.

Though Mathias Schnell won the contract for constructing the new building in January 1882, by May he had assigned all interest to Taylor, Babcock and Company. This company was composed of Colonel Abner Taylor of Chicago, Colonel A.C. Babcock of Canton, and John V. and Charles B. Farwell of Chicago. Taylor was assigned company representative in June. Babcock inspected the capitol tract that same year, setting out from Tascosa on 23 March and arriving at the Yellow Houses on 27 April. His inspection noted the 1880 J.T. Munson survey used to define the capitol lands, and the northwest boundary of the state was defined by John H. Clark&#x27;s 1859 survey. Clark&#x27;s line defining the 103rd meridian, approved by Congress in 1891, turned out to be about one half mile west of the true meridian. The issue was not settled until John V. Farwell and President William Howard Taft were instrumental in passing a joint resolution in 1911 by Congress honoring the Clark line. This action saved Texas a strip of land one half mile wide and 310 miles long.

== Development ==
In order to raise the capital needed to fence the ranch, build houses and barns, provide water, and purchase the cattle, John V. Farwell formed the Capitol Freehold Land and Investment Company, Limited, in London. The money was raised through the sale of debentures paying 5 percent interest. Directors of the company included John V. and Charles B. Farwell, Walter Potter, Henry Seton-Karr, Sir William Ewart, Edward M. Denny, Baron Thurlow, and the Marquis of Tweeddale, while the Earl of Aberdeen and Quintin Hogg were trustees. The company existed until 1909, when all bonds had been redeemed.

Company headquarters were located in the northern boundary of the ranch, at Buffalo Springs, with George Findlay directing business. Colonel B.H. Campbell became general manager and Berry Nations range foreman. The ranch started operations in 1885, purchasing cattle and moving them onto the ranch. By 1887, the herd was maintained at between 125,000 and 150,000 head, or about per head. W.S. Mabry surveyed in the four-wire barbed wire fence line, and by 1886, of fence were in place, including a long west line and a long east line. Cross fences were added by the late 1890s to make 94 pastures, bringing the total to of fence. A telephone line connected Tascosa to Alamocitos in 1888. Though the northern portion of the ranch had plenty of water near Buffalo Springs, the portion south of the Canadian River needed wells, which were also surveyed in by Mabry. By 1900, the ranch had 335 windmills, producing water from an average depth of . Additionally, 100 earthen dams were constructed.

Trail driver Ab Blocker devised the XIT brand. The branding iron was simply made with a five-inch-long (15 cm) straight bar, applied five times. Yet, the XIT brand was not immune from &quot;brand burning&quot; by rustlers, which involved burning the original brand into another brand. Cowboy legends also kept alive the myth that the brand means &quot;Ten (in Roman numerals) In Texas.&quot; Each calf was branded with XIT on its side, the last numeral of the year on its shoulder, and the number of the division on its jaw.

The ranch was initially divided into 7 division headquarters, located at (1) Buffalo Springs, (2) Middle Water, (3) Ojo Bravo, (4) Rito Blanco, (5) Escarbada, (6) Spring Lake, and (7) Yellow Houses, with (8) Bovina added later. Each was equipped with residences, cellars, bunkhouses, store rooms, barns, corrals, and two-wagon freight outfit. Large warehouses were maintained at Tascosa in 1887, after the introduction of the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad, and in Bovina, after it was connected to the J.J. Hagerman&#x27;s Pecos Valley and Northeastern Railroad in 1898. General headquarters were moved to Channing in 1890. Each division wrote a monthly report and an annual report containing details about the cattle, range weather, and the men employed. Buffalo Springs became the steer ranch, Middle Water the cull ranch, while Ojo Bravo, Escarbada, Spring Lake and Yellow Houses became breeding ranges. The 10–12 cowboys working a division in the winter increased to 25–30 in the summer.

Campbell&#x27;s management led to the ranch becoming a &quot;stopping place and rendezvous for a large number of bad men and criminals,&quot; in the words of A.L. Matlock. Matlock was picked by John V. Farwell to run the ranch in 1887. Matlock chose A.G. Boyce as his general range manager. Though the original stock consisted of Texas Longhorn cattle, in 1889, work started to improve the herd by introducing Hereford cattle and polled Aberdeen Angus. Registered herds were bought in 1892, and the Rito Blanco division bred the Angus, while the Escarbada, Spring Lake and Yellow Houses divisions bred the Herefords.

The Texas Trail was used for trail drives connecting Tascosa to Dodge City until 1885. Afterwards, the Northern Trail connected Buffalo Springs to the XIT range on Cedar Creek, 60 miles north of Miles City, Montana. That trail was used from 1886 until 1897. Over a period of 3 months, some 10,000 to 12,500 steers were moved from the Yellow Houses 1,000 miles north to Cedar Creek. There they would graze for two years before being shipped to Chicago.

==Decline==
The original plan of the Capitol Company was colonization, with ranching viewed as a temporary use of the land until farmers arrived. In 1890, Matlock began using an immigration agency, and were prepared as farming tracts. Cattle prices crashed in 1886 and 1887, and in the fall of 1888, the ranch was unable to sell its cattle and make a profit. The ranch operated most years without showing any profit. Cattle rustling and predators such as the Mexican wolf led to further losses.
In 1901, the ranch syndicate began selling off acreage to pay the bonds of the Capitol Freehold Land and Investment Company, Limited. Large tracts were sold to cattlemen such as George W. Littlefield, who bought of Yellow Houses in 1901. In 1904, the ranch started using land and development companies for wholesale purchases, but in 1905, were also divided up into 160 square-mile tracts. In 1905, to prevent speculation, the syndicate established a land commissioner and a real estate trust in 1915. This trust, Capitol Reservations Lands, operated until 1950. Yet, Capitol Mineral Rights Company retained much of the mineral rights.

The family of Minnie Lou Bradley, who went on to establish the Bradley 3 Ranch in Childress County east of Amarillo, made large purchases of XIT land. Other purchasers included Texas cattlemen William E. Halsell, and John M. Shelton. Lee Bivins bought from XIT&#x27;s Capitol Syndicate. Located near Channing, Texas, the purchase included XIT headquarters. The last of the XIT cattle were sold on 1 Nov. 1912.

Recognizing that their earlier surveys exceeded the stipulated areas by 2–4 percent, the state of Texas sued the Syndicate in 1918, claiming the excess was . As a consequence, the state recovered in Dallam County, and in Hartley County.

==Legacy==
In remembrance of the massive ranch, the City of Dalhart hosts the XIT Museum and the annual XIT Rodeo and Reunion held the first Thursday through Sunday of August. The celebration includes three days of junior and professional (PRCA) rodeo events, the world&#x27;s largest free barbecue, three nights of live music, a mud bog competition, an antique tractor pull, and other activities.

Several businesses in the Dalhart area use &quot;XIT&quot; in their names and styles.

Composer Charles Ives referenced the ranch in his song &quot;Charlie Rutlage&quot;, No. 10 of his 114 songs collection.

<doc id="548843" wikidata="Q657352" url="?curid=548843" title="Francis Lee (footballer)">
<text>Francis Henry Lee (29 April 1944 – 2 October 2023), also known as Franny Lee, was an English professional footballer and businessman. He was also later the chairman and main shareholder of Manchester City, as well as briefly a racehorse trainer and amateur cricket player.

A striker, he played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Derby County and the England national team. Noted for his speed and determination, he scored more than 200 goals in his career, in which he won League Championship medals with Manchester City and Derby. In 2010, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.

Lee holds the English record for the greatest number of penalties scored in a season, a feat that earned him the nickname &quot;Lee 1 (Pen)&quot;, because that was the way his name often seemed to appear on the list of goal scorers for City in the match results listings of the Sunday papers. This led to accusations of diving. One such accusation, by Leeds United&#x27;s Norman Hunter, led to an on-pitch fight.

In 1966, Lee founded F. H. Lee Ltd, a firm that recycled paper to manufacture products such as kitchen roll and toilet paper. It operated until 2003 and made him a millionaire. In 1994, Lee became the major shareholder and chairman of Manchester City, but stepped down four years later.

==Club career==

===Bolton Wanderers===
As a 16-year-old amateur footballer, Lee made his debut for Bolton Wanderers in November 1960 against Manchester City at Burnden Park. Playing in attack alongside club legend Nat Lofthouse, then 35-years old, both scored in a 3–1 win. He signed professionally in May 1961 and was Bolton&#x27;s top scorer in the 1962–63 season in the First Division. The following season, Bolton were relegated to the Second Division and their second tier campaign, in the 1964–65 season, was Lee&#x27;s most prolific for the club, scoring 23 league goals. He scored in seven consecutive games at the start of the 1967–68 season and in September 1967, he was transferred to Manchester City, having scored 106 goals in 210 appearances for Bolton.

===Manchester City===
Manchester City manager Joe Mercer signed him for a club record transfer fee of £60,000 in 1967. Mercer described the purchase of Lee for City as &quot;the final piece of the puzzle&quot;. He made his Manchester City debut in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Maine Road, and scored his first goal for City the following week at Fulham. In his first season at the club, he scored 16 League goals in 31 appearances, playing a crucial role in City&#x27;s push for the league title; Mercer described him as &quot;the final piece of the jigsaw&quot;. The title was decided on the final day of the season, City requiring a win at Newcastle United. City won the match 4–3, with Lee scoring one of the goals, and were crowned champions. The following season, Lee was part of the Manchester City team that won the 1969 FA Cup.

In the 1969–70 season, Lee was City&#x27;s top scorer, an achievement he would subsequently match in each of the next four seasons. His tally that season included one of the most important goals of his career, a penalty in the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

In the 1971–72 season, Lee set a British record for the number of penalties scored in a season, with 15 of his 35 goals scored from the penalty spot – seven of the penalties resulted from fouls on Lee, earning him the nickname &quot;Lee 1 (Pen)&quot;. Some journalists, holding the opinion that Lee gained a number of penalties by diving, used the name &quot;Lee Won Pen&quot; instead. Lee&#x27;s name is often cited in debates about diving in football; referees&#x27; chief Keith Hackett described him as a player who &quot;had a reputation of falling down easily&quot;.

Lee also held the record for the most goals in Manchester derbies, scoring ten goals in all against Manchester United, a tally that equalled Joe Hayes&#x27; record. This record was later beaten by Wayne Rooney, who scored his 11th goal in the fixture on 22 September 2013.

===Derby County===
Lee left Manchester City in 1974, joining Derby County. For the second time in his career, Lee joined a team viewed as contenders for that season&#x27;s league title. He was upset at Manchester City&#x27;s decision to sell him and marked his first match against his former club by scoring the winning goal for Derby. Lee scored twelve league goals that season, Derby winning their second league title and Lee the second championship medal of his career. On 1 November 1975, Lee had a confrontation with Leeds United defender Norman Hunter, which gained a level of infamy after it was screened on &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. In the first half of the game, the referee adjudged that Hunter had fouled Lee in the Leeds penalty area, and awarded Derby a penalty. Charlie George, and not Lee, took the penalty kick, and scored. In the second half, Lee and Hunter were seen to be exchanging punches in an off-the-ball incident. The referee stopped the game and took both players&#x27; names, but it was not immediately clear if he had sent off either or both of them. However, as the two men walked away they began fighting again. After intervention by both sets of players, Hunter left the pitch and Lee was restrained and ushered off the field by a club official. Lee suffered a cut lip following the fight which required four stitches and was subsequently banned for four weeks. In 2003, the incident was named by &quot;The Observer&quot; as sport&#x27;s most spectacular dismissal.

Lee played two seasons at Derby, making 80 appearances and scoring 30 goals. On 24 April 1976, the final day of the 1975–76 season, he played his last game as a professional footballer in a 6–2 win at against Ipswich Town, in which he scored two goals.

==International career==

Lee made his debut for England, aged 24 on 11 December 1968 in a friendly game against Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium. His first goal came in his next game, a 5–0 win, again in a friendly, against France on 12 March 1969. The same year, Lee played on a &quot;Rest of the UK&quot; team in a match against Wales to mark the investiture of the Prince of Wales. Lee played the first half of the match and scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the 33rd minute.

Lee represented England at the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico and was the first English player ever to receive a card in a World Cup, for kicking Brazil&#x27;s goalkeeper, Félix. He played in the World Cup games against Romania, Brazil as well as the game in which England were eliminated, a 3–2 defeat by West Germany at the Estadio de Guanajuato in León.

==Business career==

After his playing career, Lee moved into business. His toilet roll manufacturing business FH Lee Ltd once employed Peter Kay, later a famous comedian, who mentions his time there in his autobiography, &quot;The Sound of Laughter&quot;.

In 1994, Lee became chairman of Manchester City, ousting Peter Swales from the position by purchasing £3 million of shares at a price of £13.35 per share. Lee was welcomed as a hero by City&#x27;s supporters, who had formed a movement named &quot;Forward With Franny&quot; backing his attempt to gain control of the club. Upon becoming chairman, Lee made a series of extravagant claims about his plans for the club, announcing that &quot;This will be the happiest club in the land. The players will be the best paid and we&#x27;ll drink plenty of champagne, celebrate and sing until we&#x27;re hoarse&quot;. In 1995, he appointed his friend Alan Ball as manager, but the appointment proved unsuccessful and the club were relegated. Lee stepped down in 1998, with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football, a fate that Lee had dismissed at the previous annual general meeting by saying that he would &quot;jump off the Kippax&quot; if the club were relegated. He was succeeded by David Bernstein. Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra in 2007.

In addition to his business ventures, Lee also had a career as a racehorse trainer. Notable horses trained by Lee include &quot;Sir Harry Hardman&quot;, &quot;Allwight Then&quot; and &quot;Young Jason&quot;. Lee gave the trade up in 1996 to pursue his business commitments. In a training career which ran from 1984 to 1996, he trained the winners of 181 races in Britain and Ireland. Jockey Willie Carson said &quot;&quot;He was quite a good trainer and had a proper team of horses at one point.&quot;

==Personal life==
Before becoming a professional footballer Lee showed promise at cricket, representing the Horwich and Westhoughton Schools FA Team in 1958. When his football career came to an end, he briefly returned to cricket, playing for Westhoughton&#x27;s first XI in 1977 as a medium-fast bowler and middle to lower order batsman.

Lee was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity.

On 2 October 2023, Lee died after a long illness with cancer. He was 79.

<text>Titus Fulvius Junius Quietus (died 261) was a Roman usurper against Roman Emperor Gallienus.

==History==

Quietus was the son of Fulvius Macrianus and a noblewoman, possibly named Junia. According to &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, he was a military tribune under Valerian, but this information is challenged by historians.

He gained the imperial office with his brother Macrianus Minor, after the capture of Emperor Valerian in the Sassanid campaign of 260. With the lawful heir, Gallienus, being far away in the West, the soldiers elected the two emperors. The support of his father, controller of the imperial treasure, and the influence of Balista, Praetorian prefect of the late Emperor Valerian, proved instrumental in his promotion.

Quietus and Macrianus, elected consuls, had to face the Emperor Gallienus, at the time in the West. Quietus and Balista stayed in the eastern provinces, while his brother and father marched their army to Europe to seize control of the Roman Empire. After the defeat and deaths of his brother and father in Thrace in 261, Quietus lost the control of the provinces in favour of Septimus Odaenathus of Palmyra, a loyal client king of the Romans who had helped push the Persians out of the eastern provinces and recovered Roman Mesopotamia in 260. Forced to flee to the city of Emesa, he was besieged there by Odaenathus, during the course of which he was killed by its inhabitants, possibly instigated by Balista.

== Cultural depictions ==
Quietus appears in Harry Sidebottom&#x27;s historical fiction novel series as one of the series&#x27; antagonists.

<text>The Department for Transport (DfT) is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for the English transport network and a limited number of transport matters in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland that have not been devolved. The department is led by the Secretary of State for Transport.

The expenditure, administration, and policy of the Department of Transport are scrutinised by the Transport Committee.

==Responsibilities==
The Department for Transport has six strategic objectives:
* Support the creation of a stronger, cleaner, more productive economy
* Help to connect people and places, balancing investment across the country
* Make journeys easier, modern and reliable
* Make sure transport is safe, secure and sustainable
* Prepare the transport system for technological progress and a prosperous future outside the EU
* Promote a culture of efficiency and productivity in everything it does

The department &quot;creates the strategic framework&quot; for transport services, which are delivered through a wide range of public and private sector bodies including its own executive agencies.

The DfT sponsors the following public bodies:

=== Non-ministerial departments ===
*Office of Rail and Road (ORR)

=== Executive agencies ===
*Active Travel England (ATE)
*Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)
*Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)
*Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA)
*Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA)

=== Non-departmental public bodies ===
*British Transport Police Authority
*Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee
*Northern Lighthouse Board
*Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain
*Transport Focus
*Trinity House Lighthouse Service

=== Public corporations ===
*Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)
*Crossrail International
*DfT Operator (formerly DfT OLR Holdings)
*East West Railway Company
*Great British Railways (GBR)
*High Speed 2 (HS2)
*London and Continental Railways (LCR)
*National Highways (formerly Highways England and the Highways Agency)
*Network Rail

=== Other bodies ===
*Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB)
*Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB)
*Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB)

=== Transport publications and data ===
DfT publications include the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges and Transport Analysis Guidance (TAG, formerly WebTAG).

The DfT maintains datasets including the National Trip End Model and traffic counts on major roads.

=== Devolution ===
The devolution of transport policy varies around the UK; most aspects in Great Britain are decided at Westminster. Key reserved transport matters (i.e., not devolved) are as follows:

Scotland
Reserved matters:
*Air transport 
*Marine transport
*Navigation (including merchant shipping)
*Driving and vehicle certification
*Railways (cross-border)
*Road Numbering
Scotland&#x27;s comparability factor (the proportion of spending in this area devolved to the Scottish Government) was 91.7% for 2021/22.

Northern Ireland
Reserved matters:
* Civil aviation
* Navigation (including merchant shipping)

The department&#x27;s devolved counterparts in Northern Ireland are:
* Department for Infrastructure (general transport policy, ports, roads, and rail)
* Department of the Environment (road safety and the regulation of drivers and vehicles)
Northern Ireland&#x27;s comparability factor (the proportion of spending in this area devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive) was 95.4% for 2021/22.

Wales
Reserved matters:
*Railway Services 
*Air transport 
*Marine transport including Trust ports and Hovercraft
*Transport security
*Navigation (including merchant shipping)
*Driving and vehicle certification
*Road Numbering

The department&#x27;s devolved counterpart in Wales is the Minister for Climate Change.

Wales&#x27; comparability factor (the proportion of spending in this area devolved to the Welsh Government) was 36.6% for 2021/22. This represents a significant reduction (e.g. it was 80.9% in 2015) due to the controversial classification of HS2 as an &#x27;England and Wales&#x27; project.

==History==
The Ministry of Transport was established by the Ministry of Transport Act 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5. c. 50) which provided for the transfer to the new ministry of powers and duties of any government department in respect of railways, light railways, tramways, canals and inland waterways, roads, bridges and ferries, and vehicles and traffic thereon, harbours, docks and piers.

In September 1919, all the powers of the Road Board, the Ministry of Health, and the Board of Trade in respect of transport, were transferred to the new ministry. Initially, the department was organised to carry out supervisory, development and executive functions, but the end of railway and canal control by 1921, and the settlement of financial agreements relating to the wartime operations of the railways reduced its role. In 1923, the department was reorganised into three major sections: Secretarial, Finance and Roads.

The ministry&#x27;s functions were exercised initially throughout the United Kingdom. An Irish Branch was established in 1920, but then was taken over by the government of the Irish Free State on the transfer of functions in 1922.

The department took over transport functions of Scottish departments in the same year, though certain functions relating to local government, loan sanction, byelaws and housing were excepted. In May 1937, power to make provisional orders for harbour, pier and ferry works was transferred to the Secretary of State for Scotland.

The growth of road transport increased the responsibilities of the ministry, and in the 1930s, and especially with defence preparations preceding the outbreak of war, government responsibilities for all means of transport increased significantly.

Government control of transport and diverse associated matters has been reorganised a number of times in modern history, being the responsibility of:

*1919–1941: Ministry of Transport
*1941–1946: Ministry of War Transport, after absorption of Ministry of Shipping
*1946–1953: Ministry of Transport
*1953–1959: Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
*1959–1970: Ministry of Transport
*1970–1976: Department of the Environment
*1976–1997: Department of Transport
*1997–2001: Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions
*2001–2002: Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions
*2002–present: Department for Transport

The name &quot;Ministry of Transport&quot; lives on in the annual MOT test, a test of vehicle safety, , and exhaust emissions, which most vehicles used on public roads in the UK are required to pass annually once they reach three years old (four years for vehicles in Northern Ireland).

=== 2017 judicial review ===
Following a series of strikes, poor performance, concerns over access for the disabled and commuter protests relating to Govia Thameslink Railway a group of commuters crowdfunded £26,000 to initiate a judicial review into the Department for Transport&#x27;s management and failure to penalise Govia or remove the management contract. The oral hearing to determine if commuters have standing to bring a judicial review was listed for 29 June 2017 at the Royal Courts of Justice.

The attempted judicial review was not allowed to proceed, and the commuters who brought it had to pay £17,000 in costs to the Department for Transport.

== Ministers ==
The DfT Ministers are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:

The Permanent Secretary is Dame Bernadette Kelly.

<doc id="548857" wikidata="Q2303083" url="?curid=548857" title="State-transition table">
<text>In automata theory and sequential logic, a state-transition table is a table showing what state (or states in the case of a nondeterministic finite automaton) a finite-state machine will move to, based on the current state and other inputs. It is essentially a truth table in which the inputs include the current state along with other inputs, and the outputs include the next state along with other outputs.

A state-transition table is one of many ways to specify a finite-state machine. Other ways include a state diagram.

== Common forms ==
=== One-dimension ===
State-transition tables are sometimes one-dimensional tables, also called &quot;characteristic tables&quot;. They are much more like truth tables than their two-dimensional form. The single dimension indicates inputs, current states, next states and (optionally) outputs associated with the state transitions.

=== Two-dimensions ===
State-transition tables are typically two-dimensional tables. There are two common ways for arranging them.

In the first way, one of the dimensions indicates current states, while the other indicates inputs. The row/column intersections indicate next states and (optionally) outputs associated with the state transitions.

In the second way, one of the dimensions indicates current states, while the other indicates next states. The row/column intersections indicate inputs and (optionally) outputs associated with the state transitions.

== Other forms ==
Simultaneous transitions in multiple finite-state machines can be shown in what is effectively an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional state-transition table in which pairs of rows map (sets of) current states to next states. This is an alternative to representing communication between separate, interdependent finite-state machines.

At the other extreme, separate tables have been used for each of the transitions within a single finite-state machine: &quot;AND/OR tables&quot; are similar to incomplete decision tables in which the decision for the rules which are present is implicitly the activation of the associated transition.

== Example ==
An example of a state-transition table together with the corresponding state diagram for a finite-state machine that accepts a string with an even number 0s is given below:


In the state-transition table, all possible inputs to the finite-state machine are enumerated across the columns of the table, while all possible states are enumerated across the rows. If the machine is in the state S1 (the first row) and receives an input of 1 (second column), the machine will stay in the state S1. Now if the machine is in the state S1 and receives an input of 0 (first column), the machine will transition to the state S2.&lt;br&gt;
In the state diagram, the former is denoted by the arrow looping from S1 to S1 labeled with a 1, and the latter is denoted by the arrow from S1 to S2 labeled with a 0. This process can be described statistically using Markov Chains.

For a nondeterministic finite-state machine, an input may cause the machine to be in more than one state, hence its non-determinism. This is denoted in a state-transition table by the set of all target states enclosed in a pair of braces {}. An example of a state-transition table together with the corresponding state diagram for a nondeterministic finite-state machine is given below:


If the machine is in the state S2 and receives an input of 0, the machine will be in two states at the same time, the states S1 and S2.

<doc id="548862" wikidata="Q1422862" url="?curid=548862" title="Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster">
<text>The Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) was the first solid-propellant rocket to be used for primary propulsion on a vehicle used for human spaceflight. A pair of them provided 85% of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s thrust at liftoff and for the first two minutes of ascent. After burnout, they were jettisoned, and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean, where they were recovered, examined, refurbished, and reused.

The Space Shuttle SRBs were the most powerful solid rocket motors to ever launch humans. The Space Launch System (SLS) SRBs, adapted from the shuttle, surpassed it as the most powerful solid rocket motors ever flown, after the launch of the Artemis 1 mission in 2022. Each Space Shuttle SRB provided a maximum thrust, roughly double the most powerful single-combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever flown, the Rocketdyne F-1. With a combined mass of about , they comprised over half the mass of the Shuttle stack at liftoff.

The motor segments of the SRBs were manufactured by Thiokol of Brigham City, Utah, which was later purchased by Alliant Techsystems (ATK). The prime contractor for the integration of all the components and retrieval of the spent SRBs, was United Space Boosters Inc., a subsidiary of Pratt &amp; Whitney. The contract was subsequently transitioned to United Space Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Out of 270 SRBs launched over the Shuttle program, all but four were recovered – those from STS-4 (due to a parachute malfunction) and STS-51-L (terminated by the range during the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster). Over 5,000 parts were refurbished for reuse after each flight. The final set of SRBs that launched STS-135 included parts that had flown on 59 previous missions, including STS-1. Recovery also allowed post-flight examination of the boosters, identification of anomalies, and incremental design improvements.

==Overview==

The two reusable SRBs provided the main thrust to lift the shuttle off the launch pad and up to an altitude of about . While on the pad, the two SRBs carried the entire weight of the external tank and orbiter and transmitted the weight load through their structure to the mobile launcher platform. Each booster had a liftoff thrust of approximately at sea level, increasing shortly after liftoff to . They were ignited after the three RS-25 main engines&#x27; thrust level was verified. Seventy-five seconds after SRB separation, SRB apogee occurred at an altitude of approximately ; parachutes were then deployed and impact occurred in the ocean approximately downrange, after which the two SRBs were recovered. The SRBs helped take the Space Shuttle to an altitude of and a speed of along with the main engines.

The SRBs committed the shuttle to liftoff and ascent, without the possibility of launch abort, until both motors had fully consumed their propellants and had simultaneously been jettisoned by explosive jettisoning bolts from the remainder of the vehicle. Only then could any conceivable set of launch or post-liftoff abort procedures be contemplated. In addition, failure of an individual SRB&#x27;s thrust output or ability to adhere to the designed performance profile was probably not survivable.

The SRBs were the largest solid-propellant motors ever flown and the first of such large rockets designed for reuse. Each is long and in diameter. Each SRB weighed approximately at launch. The two SRBs constituted about 69% of the total lift-off mass. The primary propellants were ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer along with aluminum powder and PBAN as fuel. The total propellant load for each solid rocket motor weighed approximately (see ). The inert weight of each SRB was approximately .

Primary elements of each booster were the motor (including case, propellant, igniter, and nozzle), structure, separation systems, operational flight instrumentation, recovery avionics, pyrotechnics, deceleration system, thrust vector control system, and range safety destruct system.

While the terms &quot;solid rocket motor&quot; and &quot;solid rocket booster&quot; are often used interchangeably, in technical use they have specific meanings. The term &quot;solid rocket motor&quot; applied to the propellant, case, igniter and nozzle. &quot;Solid rocket booster&quot; applied to the entire rocket assembly, which included the rocket motor as well as the recovery parachutes, electronic instrumentation, separation rockets, range safety destruct system, and thrust vector control.

Each booster was attached to the external tank at the SRB&#x27;s aft frame by two lateral sway braces and a diagonal attachment. The forward end of each SRB was attached to the external tank at the forward end of the SRB&#x27;s forward skirt. On the launch pad, each booster also was attached to the mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four holddown studs, with frangible nuts that were severed at liftoff.

The boosters were composed of seven individually manufactured steel segments. These were assembled in pairs by the manufacturer and then shipped to Kennedy Space Center by rail for final assembly. The segments were fixed together using circumferential tang, clevis, and clevis pin fastening, and sealed with O-rings (originally two, changed to three after the &quot;Challenger&quot; Disaster in 1986) and heat-resistant putty.

==Components==

===Hold-down posts===
Each solid rocket booster had four hold-down posts that fit into corresponding support posts on the mobile launcher platform. Hold-down studs held the SRB and launcher platform posts together. Each stud had a nut at each end, the top one being a frangible nut. The top nut contained two explosive charges initiated by NASA standard detonators (NSDs), which were ignited at solid rocket motor ignition commands.

When the two NSDs were ignited at each hold down, the frangible nut fractured, releasing the hold-down stud. The stud traveled downward because of the release of tension in the stud (pretensioned before launch), NSD gas pressure and gravity. The stud was stopped by the stud deceleration stand, which contained sand. The hold-down stud was long and in diameter. The frangible nut was captured in a blast container mounted on the aft skirt of the SRB.

The solid rocket motor ignition commands were issued by the orbiter&#x27;s computers through the master events controllers to the hold-down pyrotechnic initiator controllers (PICs) on the mobile launcher platform. They provided the ignition to the hold-down NSDs. The launch processing system monitored the SRB hold-down PICs for low voltage during the last 16 seconds before launch. PIC low voltage would initiate a launch hold.

===Electrical power distribution===
Electrical power distribution in each SRB consisted of orbiter-supplied main DC bus power to each SRB via SRB buses labeled A, B and C. Orbiter main DC buses A, B and C supplied main DC bus power to corresponding SRB buses A, B and C. In addition, orbiter main DC bus C supplied backup power to SRB buses A and B, and orbiter bus B supplied backup power to SRB bus C. This electrical power distribution arrangement allowed all SRB buses to remain powered in the event one orbiter main bus failed.

The nominal operating voltage was DC.

===Hydraulic power units===
Each SRB consists of two self-contained, independent Hydraulic Power Units (HPUs), used to actuate the thrust vector control (TVC) system. Each HPU consisted of an auxiliary power unit (APU), fuel supply module, hydraulic pump, hydraulic reservoir and hydraulic fluid manifold assembly. The APUs were fueled by hydrazine and generated mechanical shaft power to drive a hydraulic pump that produced hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system. The two separate HPUs and two hydraulic systems were located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB nozzle and aft skirt. The HPU components were mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators. The two systems operated from T minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank. The two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the nozzle rock and tilt servoactuators.

The HPU controller electronics were located in the SRB aft integrated electronic assemblies (IEAs) on the aft external tank attach rings.

The HPUs and their fuel systems were isolated from each other. Each fuel supply module (tank) contained of hydrazine. The fuel tank was pressurized with gaseous nitrogen at , which provided the force to expel (positive expulsion) the fuel from the tank to the fuel distribution line, maintaining a positive fuel supply to the APU throughout its operation.

In the APU, a fuel pump boosted the hydrazine pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed back over the gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the fuel pump, its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. A startup bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the fuel pump outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump.

When the APU speed reached 100%, the APU primary control valve closed, and the APU speed was controlled by the APU controller electronics. If the primary control valve logic failed to the open state, the secondary control valve assumed control of the APU at 112% speed.

Each HPU on an SRB was connected to both servoactuators on that SRB by a switching valve that allowed the hydraulic power to be distributed from either HPU to both actuators if necessary. Each HPU served as the primary hydraulic source for one servoactuator, and a secondary source for the other servoactuator. Each HPU possessed the capacity to provide hydraulic power to both servoactuators within 115% operational limits in the event that hydraulic pressure from the other HPU should drop below . A switch contact on the switching valve closed when the valve was in the secondary position. When the valve was closed, a signal was sent to the APU controller, that inhibited the 100% APU speed control logic and enabled the 112% APU speed control logic. The 100-percent APU speed enabled one APU/HPU to supply sufficient operating hydraulic pressure to both servoactuators of that SRB.

The APU 100-percent speed corresponded to 72,000 rpm, 110% to 79,200 rpm, and 112% to 80,640 rpm.

The hydraulic pump speed was 3,600 rpm and supplied hydraulic pressure of . A high pressure relief valve provided overpressure protection to the hydraulic system and relieved at .

The APUs/HPUs and hydraulic systems were reusable for 20 missions.

===Thrust vector control===
Each SRB had two hydraulic gimbal servoactuators, to move the nozzle up/down and side-to-side. This provided thrust vectoring to help control the vehicle in all three axes (roll, pitch, and yaw).

The ascent thrust vector control portion of the flight control system directed the thrust of the three shuttle main engines and the two SRB nozzles to control shuttle attitude and trajectory during lift-off and ascent. Commands from the guidance system were transmitted to the Ascent Thrust Vector Control (ATVC) drivers, which transmitted signals proportional to the commands to each servoactuator of the main engines and SRBs. Four independent flight control system channels and four ATVC channels controlled six main engine and four SRB ATVC drivers, with each driver controlling one hydraulic port on each main and SRB servoactuator.

Each SRB servoactuator consisted of four independent, two-stage servovalves that received signals from the drivers. Each servovalve controlled one power spool in each actuator, which positioned an actuator ram and the nozzle to control the direction of thrust.

The four servovalves operating each actuator provided a force-summed majority-voting arrangement to position the power spool. With four identical commands to the four servovalves, the actuator force-sum action prevented, instantaneously, a single erroneous input affecting power ram motion. If differential-pressure sensing detected the erroneous input persisting over a predetermined time, an isolating valve would be selected, excluding it from the force-sum entirely. Failure monitors were provided for each channel to indicate which channel had been bypassed, and the isolation valve on each channel could be reset.

Each actuator ram was equipped with transducers for position feedback to the thrust vector control system. Within each servoactuator ram was a splashdown load relief assembly to cushion the nozzle at water splashdown and prevent damage to the nozzle flexible bearing.

===Rate gyro assemblies===
Each SRB contained three rate gyro assemblies (RGAs), with each RGA containing one pitch and one yaw gyro. These provided an output proportional to angular rates about the pitch and yaw axes to the orbiter computers and guidance, navigation and control system during first-stage ascent flight in conjunction with the orbiter roll rate gyros until SRB separation. At SRB separation, a switchover was made from the SRB RGAs to the orbiter RGAs.

The SRB RGA rates passed through the orbiter flight aft multiplexers/demultiplexers to the orbiter GPCs. The RGA rates were then mid-value-selected in redundancy management to provide SRB pitch and yaw rates to the user software. The RGAs were designed for 20 missions.

===Segment cases===
Made out of 2-cm-thick D6AC high-strength low-alloy steel.

===Propellant===

The rocket propellant mixture in each solid rocket motor consisted of ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer, 69.6% by weight), atomized aluminum powder (fuel, 16%), iron oxide (catalyst, 0.4%), PBAN (binder, also acts as fuel, 12.04%), and an epoxy curing agent (1.96%). This propellant is commonly referred to as &quot;ammonium perchlorate composite propellant&quot; (APCP). This mixture gave the solid rocket motors a specific impulse of at sea level or in a vacuum. Upon ignition, the motor burned the fuel at a nominal chamber pressure of .

Aluminum was chosen as a propellant due to high volumetric energy density, and its resilience to accidental ignition. Aluminum has a specific energy density of about 31.0 MJ/kg .

The propellant had an 11-pointed star-shaped perforation in the forward motor segment and a double-truncated-cone perforation in each of the aft segments and aft closure. This configuration provided high thrust at ignition and then reduced the thrust by approximately a third 50 seconds after lift-off to avoid overstressing the vehicle during maximum dynamic pressure (max. Q).

==Function==
===Ignition===
SRB ignition can occur only when a manual lock pin from each SRB safe and arm device has been removed. The ground crew removes the pin during prelaunch activities. At T−5:00, the SRB safe and arm device is rotated to the arm position. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued when the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) are at or above 90% of rated thrust, no SSME fail and/or SRB ignition Pyrotechnic Initiator Controller (PIC) low voltage is indicated and there are no holds from the Launch Processing System (LPS).

The solid rocket motor ignition commands are sent by the orbiter computers through the Master Events Controllers (MECs) to the safe and arm device NASA standard detonators (NSDs) in each SRB. A PIC single-channel capacitor discharge device controls the firing of each pyrotechnic device. Three signals must be present simultaneously for the PIC to generate the pyro firing output. These signals, arm, fire 1 and fire 2, originate in the orbiter general-purpose computers (GPCs) and are transmitted to the MECs. The MECs reformat them to 28 volt DC signals for the PICs. The arm signal charges the PIC capacitor to 40 volts DC (minimum of 20 volts DC).

The GPC launch sequence also controls certain critical main propulsion system valves and monitors the engine ready indications from the SSMEs. The MPS start commands are issued by the onboard computers at T−6.6 seconds (staggered start engine three, engine two, engine one all approximately within 0.25 of a second), and the sequence monitors the thrust buildup of each engine. All three SSMEs must reach the required 90% thrust within three seconds; otherwise, an orderly shutdown is commanded and safing functions are initiated.

Normal thrust buildup to the required 90% thrust level will result in the SSMEs being commanded to the lift off position at T−3 seconds as well as the fire 1 command being issued to arm the SRBs. At T−3 seconds, the vehicle base bending load modes are allowed to initialize (referred to as the &quot;twang&quot;, movement of approximately measured at the tip of the external tank, with movement towards the external tank).

The fire 2 commands cause the redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel. This ignites a pyro. booster charge, which is retained in the safe and arm device behind a perforated plate. The booster charge ignites the propellant in the igniter initiator; and combustion products of this propellant ignite the solid rocket motor initiator, which fires down the entire vertical length of the solid rocket motor igniting the solid rocket motor propellant along its entire surface area instantaneously.

At T−0, the two SRBs are ignited, under command of the four onboard computers; separation of the four explosive bolts on each SRB is initiated; the two T-0 umbilicals (one on each side of the spacecraft) are retracted; the onboard master timing unit, event timer and mission event timers are started; the three SSMEs are at 100%; and the ground launch sequence is terminated.

===Lift-off and ascent===

Timing sequence referencing in ignition is critical for a successful liftoff and ascent flight. The explosive hold-down bolts relieve (through the launch support pedestals and pad structure) the asymmetric vehicle dynamic loads caused by the SSME ignition and thrust buildup, and applied thrust bearing loads. Without the hold-down bolts the SSMEs would violently tip the flight stack (orbiter, external tank, SRBs) over onto the external tank. That rotating moment is initially countered by the hold-bolts. Prior to release of the vehicle stack for liftoff, the SRBs must simultaneously ignite and pressurize their combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles to produce a thrust-derived, net counter-rotating moment exactly equal to the SSME&#x27;s rotating moment. With the SRBs reaching full thrust, the hold-down bolts are blown, releasing the vehicle stack, the net rotating moment is zero, and the net vehicle thrust (opposing gravity) is positive, lifting the orbiter stack vertically from the launch pedestal, controllable through the coordinated gimbal movements of the SSMEs and the SRB exhaust nozzles.

During ascent, multiple all-axis accelerometers detect and report the vehicle&#x27;s flight and orientation (referencing the flight deck aboard the orbiter), as the flight reference computers translate navigation commands (steering to a particular waypoint in space, and at a particular time) into engine and motor nozzle gimbal commands, which orient the vehicle about its center of mass. As the forces on the vehicle change due to propellant consumption, increasing speed, changes in aerodynamic drag, and other factors, the vehicle automatically adjusts its orientation in response to its dynamic control command inputs.

===Separation===

The SRBs are jettisoned from the space shuttle at an altitude of about . SRB separation is initiated when the three solid-rocket motor-chamber pressure transducers are processed in the redundancy-management middle-value select and the head-end chamber pressure of both SRBs is less than or equal to . A backup cue is the time elapsed from booster ignition. The separation sequence is initiated, commanding the thrust vector control actuators to the null position and putting the main propulsion system into a second-stage configuration (0.8 seconds from sequence initialization), which ensures the thrust of each SRB is less than . Orbiter yaw attitude is held for four seconds, and SRB thrust drops to less than .

The SRBs separate from the external tank within 30 milliseconds of the ordnance firing command. The forward attachment point consists of a ball (SRB) and socket (External Tank; ET) held together by one bolt. The bolt contains one NSD pressure cartridge at each end. The forward attachment point also carries the range safety system cross-strap wiring connecting each SRB Range Safety System (RSS) and the ET RSS with each other. The aft attachment points consist of three separate struts: upper, diagonal and lower. Each strut contains one bolt with an NSD pressure cartridge at each end. The upper strut also carries the umbilical interface between its SRB and the external tank and on to the orbiter.

There are four booster separation motors (BSMs) on each end of each SRB. The BSMs separate the SRBs from the external tank. The solid rocket motors in each cluster of four are ignited by firing redundant NSD pressure cartridges into redundant confined detonating fuse manifolds. The separation commands issued from the orbiter by the SRB separation sequence initiate the redundant NSD pressure cartridge in each bolt and ignite the BSMs to effect a clean separation.

===Range safety system===

A range safety system (RSS) provides for destruction of a rocket or part of it with on-board explosives by remote command if the rocket is out of control, in order to limit the danger to people on the ground from crashing pieces, explosions, fire, poisonous substances, etc. The RSS was only activated once – during the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster (37 seconds after the breakup of the vehicle, when the SRBs were in uncontrolled flight).

The shuttle vehicle had two RSS, one in each SRB. Both were capable of receiving two command messages (arm and fire) transmitted from the ground station. The RSS was used only when the shuttle vehicle violates a launch trajectory red line.

An RSS consists of two antenna couplers, command receivers/decoders, a dual distributor, a safe and arm device with two NASA standard detonators (NSD), two confined detonating fuse manifolds (CDF), seven CDF assemblies and one linear-shaped charge (LSC).

The antenna couplers provide the proper impedance for radio frequency and ground support equipment commands. The command receivers are tuned to RSS command frequencies and provide the input signal to the distributors when an RSS command is sent. The command decoders use a code plug to prevent any command signal other than the proper command signal from getting into the distributors. The distributors contain the logic to supply valid destruct commands to the RSS pyrotechnics.

The NSDs provide the spark to ignite the CDF, which in turn ignites the LSC for booster destruction. The safe and arm device provides mechanical isolation between the NSDs and the CDF before launch and during the SRB separation sequence.

The first message, called arm, allows the onboard logic to enable a destruct and illuminates a light on the flight deck display and control panel at the commander and pilot station. The second message transmitted is the fire command.

The SRB distributors in the SRBs are cross-strapped together. Thus, if one SRB received an arm or destruct signal, the signal would also be sent to the other SRB.

Electrical power from the RSS battery in each SRB is routed to RSS system A. The recovery battery in each SRB is used to power RSS system B as well as the recovery system in the SRB. The SRB RSS is powered down during the separation sequence, and the SRB recovery system is powered up.

===Descent and recovery===

The SRBs are jettisoned from the shuttle system at 2 minutes and an altitude of about . After continuing to rise to about , the SRBs begin to fall back to earth and once back in the denser atmosphere are slowed by a parachute system to prevent damage on ocean impact. A command is sent from the orbiter to the SRB just before separation to apply battery power to the recovery logic network. A second, simultaneous command arms the three nose cap thrusters (for deploying the pilot and drogue parachute), the frustum ring detonator (for main parachute deployment), and the main parachute disconnect ordnance.

The recovery sequence begins with the operation of the high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of , about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7- and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately and weighs approximately .
After the drogue chute has stabilized the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum is separated from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then pulled away from the SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10- and 17-second reefing line cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the diameter, 20° conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately and each weighs approximately . These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used, in both deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.

Water impact occurs about 279 seconds after SRB separation at a nominal velocity of . The water impact range is approximately off the eastern coast of Florida. Because the parachutes provide for a nozzle-first impact, air is trapped in the empty (burned out) motor casing, causing the booster to float with the forward end approximately out of the water.
Formerly, the main chutes were released from the SRB at impact using a parachute release nut ordnance system (residual loads in the main chutes would deploy the parachute attach fittings with floats tethered to each fitting). The current design keeps the main chutes attached during water impact (initial impact and slapdown). Salt Water Activated Release (SWAR) devices are now incorporated into the main chute riser lines to simplify recovery efforts and reduce damage to the SRB. The drogue deployment bag/pilot parachutes, drogue parachutes and frustums, each main chute, and the SRBs are buoyant and are recovered.

Specially fitted NASA recovery ships, the and the , recover the SRBs and descent/recovery hardware. Once the boosters are located, the Diver Operated Plug (DOP) is maneuvered by divers into place to plug the SRB nozzle and drain the water from the motor case. Pumping air into and water out of the SRB causes the SRB to change from a nose-up floating position to a horizontal attitude more suitable for towing. The retrieval vessels then tow the boosters and other objects recovered back to Kennedy Space Center.

==&quot;Challenger&quot; disaster==
The loss of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; originated with a system failure of one of its SRBs. The cause of the accident was found by the Rogers Commission to be &quot;a faulty design unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors&quot; of the SRB joints compounded by unusually cold weather the morning of the flight. The field joint design was flawed, with flexure of the joints during launch compromising the seal of the large rubber O-rings and allowing them to extrude further into the joint and erode as hot exhaust gases passed through during past launches. Additionally, the O-rings were not resilient at low temperatures like those of the January 1986 morning of the accident (). A cold-compromised joint in the right SRB failed at launch and allowed hot gases from within that rocket booster to sear a hole into the adjacent main external fuel tank and also weaken the lower strut holding the SRB to the external tank. The leak in the SRB joint caused the eventually catastrophic failure of the lower strut and partial detachment of the SRB, which led to a collision between the SRB and the external tank. With the external tank being destroyed and the shuttle stack, traveling at a speed of Mach1.92 at , thrusted off-axis by the right SRB as well as the tank&#x27;s collapse, &quot;Challenger&quot; disintegrated. Both SRBs survived the accident. Shortly before the disaster, engineers representing Thiokol recommended scrubbing the launch due to the cold temperatures, but were overridden by NASA managers.

During the subsequent downtime, detailed structural analyses were performed on critical structural elements of the SRB. Analyses were primarily focused on areas where anomalies had been noted during postflight inspection of recovered hardware.

One of the areas was the attachment ring where the SRBs are connected to the external tank. Areas of distress were noted in some of the fasteners where the ring attaches to the SRB motor case. This situation was attributed to the high loads encountered during water impact. To correct the situation and ensure higher strength margins during ascent, the attach ring was redesigned to encircle the motor case completely (360°). Previously, the attachment ring formed a &#x27;C&#x27; shape and encircled the motor case just 270°. Additionally, special structural tests were performed on the aft skirt. During this test program, an anomaly occurred in a critical weld between the hold-down post and skin of the skirt. A redesign was implemented to add reinforcement brackets and fittings in the aft ring of the skirt.

These two modifications added approximately to the weight of each SRB. The result is called a Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM).

==Construction and delivery==
The prime contractor for the manufacture of the SRB motor segments was ATK Launch Systems (formerly Morton Thiokol Inc.) Wasatch Division based in Magna, Utah.

United Space Boosters Inc. (USBI), a division of Pratt &amp; Whitney, under United Technologies, was the original SRB prime contractor for SRB assembly, checkout and refurbishment for all non-solid-rocket-motor components and for SRB integration. They were the longest-running prime contractor for the Space Shuttle that was part of the original launch team. USBI was absorbed by United Space Alliance as the Solid Rocket Booster Element division in 1998 and the USBI division was disbanded at Pratt &amp; Whitney the following year. At its peak, USBI had over 1500 personnel working on the Shuttle Boosters at KSC, FL and Huntsville, Alabama.

Components of the SRBs were transported from Utah to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida via rail over twelve days covering and eight states. Each segment and its custom built rail car weighed approximately . Cars carrying SRBs were separated by empty cars to distribute the load over bridges and trestles, particularly the bridge over the Indian River, the last bridge on the train&#x27;s journey. Following recovery, spent segments were loaded onto those same train cars and returned to Utah for refurbishment and refueling.

=== Incident ===
On May 2, 2007, a freight train carrying segments of the space shuttle&#x27;s solid rocket boosters derailed in Myrtlewood, Alabama, after a rail trestle collapsed. The train was carrying eight SRB segments intended for STS-120 and STS-122. Four segments dropped approximately . Four other segments along with a car carrying aft exit cones (nozzles), not yet on the trestle, remained on solid ground. The segments that fell from the trestle were recovered and returned to Utah for inspection. After analyses of the forces put on the remaining four segments that had not fallen were found to be well within tolerances, those segments continued on to Florida.

==Upgrade projects not put into service==
===Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) Project (1988–1993)===
In 1988–1989, NASA was planning on replacing the post-&quot;Challenger&quot; SRBs with a new Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) to be built by Aerojet at a new facility, designed by subcontractor, RUST International, on the location of a cancelled Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power plant, at Yellow Creek, Mississippi (Yellow Creek Nuclear Plant).

The ASRM would be slightly wider (the booster&#x27;s diameter would be increased from 146 inches to 150 inches) and have 200,000 pounds of extra propellant, and have produced additional thrust in order to increase shuttle payload by about 12,000lb, so that it could carry modules and construction components to the ISS. They were expected to be safer than the post-&quot;Challenger&quot; SRBs. The initial $1.2Bn contract was to be for 12 motors, with an option for another 88 at maybe another $1bn. Morton Thiokol would build the nozzles. The first test flight was expected around 1994.

The ASRM program was cancelled in 1993 after robotic assembly systems and computers were on-site and approximately 2 billion dollars spent, in favor of continued use of the SRB after design flaw corrections.

===Filament-wound cases===
In order to provide the necessary performance to launch polar-orbiting shuttles from the SLC-6 launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, SRBs using &quot;filament-wound cases&quot; (FWC) were designed to be more lightweight than the steel cases used on Kennedy Space Center-launched SRBs. Unlike the regular SRBs, which had the flawed field joint design that led to the &quot;Challenger&quot; Disaster in 1986, the FWC boosters had the &quot;double tang&quot; joint design (necessary to keep the boosters properly in alignment during the &quot;twang&quot; movement when the SSMEs are ignited prior to liftoff), but used the two O-ring seals. With the closure of SLC-6, the FWC boosters were scrapped by ATK and NASA, but their field joints, albeit modified to incorporate the current three O-ring seals and joint heaters, were later (after STS-51L) incorporated into the field joints on the SRBs used until the last flight in 2011.

===Five-segment booster===
Prior to the destruction of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in 2003, NASA investigated the replacement of the current 4-segment SRBs with either a 5-segment SRB design or replacing them altogether with liquid-fueled &quot;flyback&quot; boosters using either Atlas V or Delta IV EELV technologies. The 5-segment SRB, which would have required little change to the current shuttle infrastructure, would have allowed the space shuttle to carry an additional of payload in an International Space Station-inclination orbit, eliminate the dangerous &quot;Return-to-Launch Site&quot; (RTLS) and &quot;Trans-Oceanic Abort&quot; (TAL) modes, and, by using a so-called dog-leg maneuver, fly south-to-north polar orbiting flights from Kennedy Space Center.

The five-segment SRB would use a wider nozzle throat to keep within the pressure limit of the existing segment casings.

After the destruction of &quot;Columbia&quot;, NASA shelved the five-segment SRB for the Shuttle Program. One five-segment engineering test motor, ETM-03, was fired on October 23, 2003.

As part of the Constellation Program, the first stage of the Ares I rocket was planned to use five-segment SRBs; in September 2009 a five-segment Space Shuttle SRB (DM-1) was static fired on the ground in ATK&#x27;s desert testing area in Utah. Additional tests (DM-2 and DM-3) were carried out in Aug 2010 and Sept 2011.

After the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2011, the new Space Launch System (SLS) was designated to use five-segment boosters. The first test of a SRB for SLS (QM-1) was completed in early 2015, a second test (QM-2) was performed in mid 2016 at Orbital ATK&#x27;s Promontory, Utah facility.

==Displays==
Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters are on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida, the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, the United States Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the March Field Air Museum on March ARB in California, and at Orbital ATK&#x27;s facility near Promontory, Utah.
A partial filament-wound booster case is on display at Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona.

==Current, future and proposed uses==
Over time several proposals to reuse the SRB design were presented – however, as of 2016 none of these proposals progressed to regular flights before being cancelled. Until the 2022 first test flight of the Space Launch System (SLS), a sole test-flight of the Ares I-X prototype in 2009 was the furthest any of these proposals progressed.

===Ares===

NASA initially planned to reuse the four-segment SRB design and infrastructure in several Ares rockets, which would have propelled the Orion spacecraft into orbit. In 2005, NASA announced the Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle slated to carry the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle into low-Earth orbit and later to the Moon. The SRB-derived Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), named Ares I, was planned to feature a single modified 4-segment SRB for its first stage; a single liquid-fueled modified Space Shuttle Main Engine would have powered the second stage.

The Ares I design updated in 2006 featured one 5-segment SRB (originally developed for the Shuttle, but never used) as a first stage; the second stage was powered by an uprated J-2X engine, derived from the J-2, which had been used in the upper stage of Saturn V and Saturn IB. In place of the standard SRB nosecone, the Ares I would have a tapered interstage assembly connecting the booster proper with the second stage, an attitude control system derived from the Regulus missile system, and larger, heavier parachutes to lower the stage into the Atlantic Ocean for recovery.

Also introduced in 2005, was a heavy-lift Cargo Launch Vehicle (CaLV) named Ares V. Early designs of the Ares V utilized &quot;5&quot; standard-production SSMEs and a pair of 5-segment boosters identical to those proposed for the Shuttle, while later plans redesigned the boosters around the RS-68 rocket engine used on the Delta IV EELV system. Initially, NASA switched over to a system using the 5-segment boosters and a cluster of 5 RS-68s (which resulted in a widening of the Ares V core unit), then NASA reconfigured the vehicle with 6 RS-68B engines, with the boosters themselves becoming 5.5-segment boosters, with an additional half-segment to provide additional thrust at liftoff.

That final redesign would have made the Ares V booster taller and more powerful than the now-retired Saturn V/INT-20, N-1, and Energia rockets, and would have allowed the Ares V to place both the Earth Departure Stage and Altair spacecraft into low-Earth orbit for later on-orbit assembly. Unlike the 5-segment SRB for the Ares I, the 5.5-segment boosters for the Ares V were to be identical in design, construction, and function to the current SRBs except for the extra segments. Like the shuttle boosters, the Ares V boosters would fly an almost-identical flight trajectory from launch to splashdown.

The Constellation program, including Ares I and Ares V, was canceled in October 2010 by the passage of the 2010 NASA authorization bill.

===DIRECT===
The DIRECT proposal for a new, Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle, unlike the Ares I and Ares V boosters, uses a pair of classic 4-segment SRBs with the SSMEs used on the Shuttle.

===Athena III===
In 2008, PlanetSpace proposed the Athena III launch vehicle for ISS resupply flights under the COTS program; it would have featured segments from the original SRB design.

===Space Launch System (SLS)===

The first versions (Blocks 1 and 1B) of the Space Launch System (SLS) use a pair of five-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which were developed from the four-segment SRBs used for the Shuttle. Modifications for the SLS included the addition of a center booster segment, new avionics, and new insulation which eliminates the Shuttle SRB&#x27;s asbestos and is lighter. The five-segment SRBs provide approximately 25% more total impulse than the Shuttle SRB, and are not recovered after use.

<text>Mario Monti (born 19 March 1943) is an Italian politician, economist and academic who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, leading a technocratic government in the wake of the Italian debt crisis.

Monti served as a European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004, with responsibility for the Internal Market, Services, Customs and Taxation from 1995 to 1999 and for Competition from 1999 to 2004. Monti has also been rector and president of Bocconi University in Milan for many years.

On 12 November 2011, in the midst of the European sovereign debt crisis, Monti was invited by President Giorgio Napolitano to form a new technocratic government following the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi. Monti was sworn in as prime minister on 16 November 2011, just a week after having been appointed a Lifetime Senator by President Napolitano, and initially became Minister of Economy and Finances as well, giving that portfolio up the following July.

From 16 May 2013 to 17 October 2013, Monti was the president of Civic Choice, a centrist political party in Italy.

==Early life==
Mario Monti was born in Varese on 19 March 1943. His mother was from Piacenza. Although his father grew up in Varese, he was born in Luján in the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, where his grandfather Abramo had emigrated to from Italy in the 19th century and built up a soft-drink and beer-production business. Monti&#x27;s father went back to Argentina during World War II but later returned to his family home in Varese.

Monti studied at the private Leo XIII High School and attended Bocconi University of Milan, where he obtained a degree in economics in 1965. Later, he won a scholarship to Yale University where he studied under James Tobin, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics.

==Academic career==
Monti began his academic career at the University of Trento, before moving to teach economics at the University of Turin from 1970 to 1985, and finally to Bocconi University, where he was appointed Rector in 1989, and President in 1994. He also served as President of the SUERF (The European Money and Finance Forum) from 1982 to 1985. His research helped to create the &quot;Klein-Monti model&quot;, aimed at describing the behaviour of banks operating under monopoly circumstances.

==European Commissioner==
===Santer Commission===
In 1994, Monti was appointed to the Santer Commission, along with Emma Bonino, by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. In his office as a European Commissioner from 1994 to 1999, he was responsible for internal market, financial services and financial integration, customs, and taxation. His work with the Commission earned him the nickname &quot;Super Mario&quot; from his colleagues and from the press.

===Prodi Commission===
In 1999, Prime Minister Massimo D&#x27;Alema confirmed Monti&#x27;s appointment to the new Prodi Commission and he was given one of the most powerful positions at the Commission, with responsibility for Competition.

As Competition Commissioner, Monti led the investigation into a number of high-profile and controversial mergers, including: Scania AB &amp; Volvo (1999), WorldCom &amp; Sprint (2000), General Electric &amp; Honeywell (2001), Schneider Electric &amp; Legrand (2001) and Carnival Corporation &amp; P&amp;O Ferries (2002). His term in office also saw the European Court of Justice, for the first time, overrule the Commission&#x27;s decision to block a merger in three separate cases, although two were decided by his predecessor. Monti was also responsible for levying the EU&#x27;s largest ever fine at the time (€497 million) against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position in 2004.
Monti was criticised in the media and by competition lawyers for the perceived inflexibility of the merger oversight process and the high number of cases that were being blocked. On 1 November 2002, Monti responding to the European Court of Justice&#x27;s ruling which reversed his decision to block the merger between Airtours &amp; First Choice Holidays said, &quot;Last week was a tough week for the Commission&#x27;s merger control policy and of course for me.&quot; This ruling in combination with his decision to block the General Electric &amp; Honeywell merger led to criticism in the United States against both the Commission&#x27;s procedures and accusations that Monti&#x27;s decisions were politically motivated. Monti, however, was defended by supporters who saw his actions as an important step in the development of competition law in the EU. Dan Rubinfeld, an economics professor at the University of California who worked on the US Justice Department&#x27;s antitrust case against Microsoft, said of Monti, &quot;There has been a lot of talk of politics in this and other cases, but I believe he has been driven entirely by the desire to do the right thing.&quot;

On 11 December 2002, Monti proposed a series of reforms to the EU&#x27;s merger rules and made structural changes within the Commission&#x27;s Competition department which aimed to improve transparency for companies throughout the merger review process. The reforms were adopted by the EU as Regulation 139/2004 (known as ECMR).

In 2004, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi returned to power in Italy and chose not to re-appoint Monti to the Commission when his second term ended.

===Barroso Commission===
In 2010, Monti was asked by Commission President Manuel Barroso to draft a &quot;Report on the Future of the Single Market&quot; proposing further measures towards the completion of the EU&#x27;s Single Market. The published report, adopted by the EU on 13 April 2011, proposed 12 reforms to the Single Market and was intended to &quot;give new momentum&quot; to the European economy.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

===Appointment===
On 9 November 2011, Monti was appointed a lifetime senator by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. He was seen as a favourite to replace Silvio Berlusconi to lead a new unity government in Italy in order to implement reforms and austerity measures. On 12 November 2011, following Berlusconi&#x27;s resignation, Napolitano invited Monti to form a new government. Monti accepted the offer, and held talks with the leaders of the main Italian political parties, declaring that he wanted to form a government that would remain in office until the next scheduled general elections in 2013. On 16 November 2011, Monti was sworn in as Prime Minister of Italy, after unveiling a technocratic cabinet composed entirely of unelected professionals. He also chose to hold the post of Minister of Economy and Finances. On 17 and 18 November 2011, the Italian Senate and Italian Chamber of Deputies both passed motions of confidence supporting Monti&#x27;s government, with only Lega Nord voting against.

===Austerity measures===
On 4 December 2011, Monti&#x27;s government introduced emergency austerity measures intended to stem the worsening economic conditions in Italy and restore market confidence, especially after rising Italian government bond yields began to threaten Italy&#x27;s financial stability. The austerity package called for increased taxes, pension reform and measures to fight tax evasion. Monti also announced that he would be giving up his own salary as part of the reforms. On 16 December 2011, the Lower House of the Italian Parliament adopted the measures by a vote of 495 to 88. Six days later the Upper House gave final approval to the package by a vote of 257 to 41.

===Labour market reforms===
On 20 January 2012, Monti&#x27;s government formally adopted a package of reforms targeting Italy&#x27;s labour market. The reforms are intended to open certain professions (such as taxi drivers, pharmacists, doctors, lawyers and notaries) to more competition by reforming their licensing systems and abolishing minimum tariffs for their services. Article 18 of Italy&#x27;s labour code, which requires companies that employ 15 or more workers to re-hire (rather than compensate) any employee found to have been fired without just cause, would also be reformed. The reforms to Article 18 are intended to make it easier for companies to dismiss or lay off employees, which would hopefully encourage companies to hire more employees on permanent rather than short-term renewable contracts. The proposals have been met with strong opposition from labour unions and public protests. In early January 2012, consultations between the government and labour unions commenced and on 13 February it was reported in the Italian media that a compromise on the proposals was very close and the government was hopeful that reforms could be approved by the Italian parliament in March.

===2013 election===
On 21 December 2012, Monti announced his resignation as prime minister, having made a public promise to step down on 8 December, after the passing of the 2013 Budget. He initially stated that he would only remain in office until an early election could be held. However, on 28 December, he announced that he would seek to remain prime minister by contesting the election, as the leader of a centrist coalition, the Civic Choice.

The election was held on 24 February 2013, and Monti&#x27;s centrist coalition was only able to come fourth, with 10.5% of the vote. Monti remained prime minister until a coalition was formed on 28 April led by Enrico Letta.

==Political career==
===Lifetime Senator===

On 9 November 2011, Monti was appointed a Lifetime Senator by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, in accordance with the second paragraph of &quot;Article 59 of the Constitution, which merits national honour distinguished in science and society&quot;. He was a member of the Commission for Industry, Commerce and Tourism from 30 November 2011 to 14 March 2013 in the sixteenth legislature. Monti was a member of the independents&#x27; mixed parliamentary group until 19 March 2013, when he joined the Civic Choice (SC) parliamentary group, becoming the first lifetime-senator aligned with a party group. On 7 May 2013, he became a member of the Commission for Foreign Affairs and Emigration.

===President of Civic Choice===
On 4 January 2013, Monti launched Civic Choice as an electoral list of the civil society, to realize the implementation of his agenda in a future government. SC was announced as part of the With Monti for Italy (CMI) centrist coalition, alongside Union of the Centre (UdC) and Future and Freedom (FLI). In the 2013 general election, the party obtained 8.3% of the vote, 37 deputies (on own lists) and 15 senators (within CMI). On 12 March 2013, Civic Choice was turned into a political party as Monti took office as acting SC president in the Provisional Committee of the party and appointed senator Andrea Olivero as provisional political coordinator. On 16 May 2013, Mario Monti was unanimously elected president of the Civic Choice.

On 17 October 2013 he resigned and was replaced by his deputy Alberto Bombassei as acting president. Monti cited his disagreement with 12 senators (out of 20), including Mario Mauro, Andrea Olivero, Gabriele Albertini, Pier Ferdinando Casini (UdC leader), Maria Paola Merloni, Luigi Marino and Lucio Romano. Particularly, Monti criticized Mauro&#x27;s line of unconditioned support to the government and of transforming SC in a larger centre-right political party, open to The People of Freedom.

==Other activities==
Monti actively participates in several major think tanks. He was the founding chairman of Bruegel, another European think tank, which was formed in 2005.

From 2005 to 2008, he was the first president of the Bruegel Monti is also a leading member of the exclusive Bilderberg Group. He has also been an international advisor to Goldman Sachs and The Coca-Cola Company. In 2010 he became President of the Trilateral Commission. 

In 2007, Monti was one of the first supporters of the first European civic forum, États Généraux de l&#x27;Europe, initiated by European think tank EuropaNova and European Movement. He was also a member of the French government&#x27;s Attali Commission from 2007 to 2008, appointed by Nicolas Sarkozy to provide recommendations to enhance economic growth in France.

Monti is a founding member of the Spinelli Group, an organization launched in September 2010 to facilitate integration within the European Union (other members of the steering group include Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Andrew Duff and Elmar Brok).

In January 2014, Monti became Chairman of the High Level Group on Own Resources, a consultative committee of the European Union aimed at proposing new forms of revenue for the European Union&#x27;s budget. The final report of the group was adopted in December 2016 and published in January 2017. It argued for new tax sources, such as on carbon and fuel.

In 2019, Monti chaired a search committee which recommended to the European Commission the appointment of Mauro Ferrari as the next President of the European Research Council (ERC). In 2020, he was appointed by the World Health Organization&#x27;s Regional Office for Europe to chair the Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development to make recommendations on investments and reforms to improve the resilience of health and social care systems.

==Personal life==
Since 1970, Monti has been married to Elsa Antonioli (born 1944), an Italian Red Cross volunteer, with whom he has two children, Federica and Giovanni.

Known for his reserved character, Monti acknowledges not being especially sociable. He said that his youth was given over to hard study; spare-time activities included cycling and keeping up with world affairs by tuning into foreign short-wave radio stations.

In addition to his native Italian, Monti also speaks English.

<doc id="548867" wikidata="Q1317129" url="?curid=548867" title="Haré+Guu">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Renjuro Kindaichi which ran in Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot; magazine from 1997 to 2002. The series focuses on the story of a 10-year-old boy named Haré who lives in the jungle and his misadventures with Guu, a liminal being who usually presents herself as a young girl.

It was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series, followed by two OVA sequels: &quot;Haré+Guu DELUXE&quot; and &quot;Haré+Guu FINAL&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Haré+Guu&quot; opens with a pregnant Weda leaving her home in an unnamed city.

It then flashes forward to the present where Haré is a typical boy living in an unnamed village in an unidentified jungle with his lazy mother Weda. On his way back from his errand of fetching bananas, a large dark being overtakes him. Scared, he runs back to the house where his mom has decided to have a new guest, a cute girl named Guu.

The next morning, Haré wakes up to find Guu a completely different person who is no longer cute, social, or energetic. No one seems to notice the change. Guu mostly remains quiet and ignorant of things while Haré has to show her around and explain things. Haré notices Guu likes to eat things. She swallows Haré but, instead of dying, he is taken to another world in Guu&#x27;s stomach. There he meets Seiichi and Tomoyo, a couple who has accepted their fate in Guu&#x27;s stomach. After Guu spits Haré out, she accompanies him to school where she meets all of Haré&#x27;s schoolmates (whom she swallows and spits back out) and the village elder (whose chest hair she rips out).

The school receives a new doctor named Dr. Clive who came from the city and turns out to be Haré&#x27;s long-lost dad. Most of the other characters start developing personalities and eccentricities of their own. Guu goes from being silent to being extremely cynical and sarcastic towards Haré and the others. She starts being more antagonistic towards Haré. Guu starts causing shenanigans around the jungle that are meant to keep her amused (like holding a contest for Weda). She adds another resident to her stomach world, Miss Hiroko Yamada, and shows an adult form that she uses to defend Haré. Another person who appears is Dama, a hairdresser from the next village over who obsesses over her long-lost husband with white hair that she mistakes Dr. Clive for.

Bel and Asio, two servants who worked for Weda in her past life, visit the jungle. They claim that they are on vacation and wanted to see their old master. They relieve Haré of his chores around the house and Haré enjoys having to do less work.

Guu causes more disasters around the jungle such as creating a blizzard and bringing down the wrath of Dama upon Clive. Clive finally dyes his hair black to have Dama leave him alone. Haré finds out from Asio the circumstances behind Weda leaving her past life and why Weda is living in they jungle. Weda eventually forces Bel and Asio to tell the actual reason they came to the jungle: to bring Weda and Haré back to the city since her father had recently died. Weda refuses at first, but relents much to Haré&#x27;s chagrin.

Haré, Weda, Guu, Bel, and Asio make it to the city where they are met by Robert, a personal bodyguard hired to protect Haré and Weda. Robert initially dislikes Weda. When Haré and Guu are held hostage by a bank robber, Weda and Robert team up to proficiently take out the robber, safely returning Haré and Guu. Haré easily adjusts to luxurious life in the mansion while Weda is bored.

Clive comes to the city where he finally is able to convey his feelings for Weda, ensuring them to be a couple whenever Weda returns. Guu causes more hijinks by swallowing up all the servants in a game of tag. While Haré is running away, he runs into his long-lost grandmother Sharon. He then plans to have Weda and Sharon make up. Try as he might, all seemed lost as Weda was bored enough to want to return to the jungle much to Bel and Asio&#x27;s chagrin. Fortunately, Haré manages to knock some sense into her. Just as Weda was about to visit her mom, Sharon rides up and the two make up.

Haré, Weda, and Guu are back in the jungle with Clive now living permanently with Haré. Haré meets the new teacher while Lazy-Sensei was sick named Miss Yumi. Her temperament has prevented her from getting a boyfriend. She ends up falling for Haré and harassing him for the next two arcs despite their age difference. Meanwhile, the village elder&#x27;s chest hair gets so out of control he is swallowed by it enough for him to disappears for the rest of the arc.

Weda announces she&#x27;s pregnant and Clive decides that it is time to marry. After they marry, Haré starts hating the idea of another sibling as he will be the one to take care of the child due to his parents&#x27; laziness. Guu takes him back to the past where he inadvertently ran into Weda. It turns out she is lazy due to the advice he gave her to be more honest with herself. He makes up a fake name while meeting Weda which Weda uses in the present to call her second child.

The bank robber returns to exact his revenge on Weda for foiling him. When it looked like he was about to win, Dama shows up at the last minute to fight the bank robber. Dama ends up winning and the two eventually get married.

Bel misses Weda and sends out a video letter to the jungle. Weda agrees to come back to the city to visit Bel and her mom. She drags Haré and Guu back with her. Haré becomes bored, so Weda enrolls him in school where he meets and instantly falls in love with Rita. Unfortunately, it works against Haré because the school bullies get jealous of the new friendship he has formed with Rita; they bully him. Haré finds out that he is nothing special to Rita because she likes to feel superior by being nice to everyone and not making any enemies. She is only looking out for her own self interests. Eventually, Rita sees Haré for the friend he is and learns to care about others.

Weda resolves things at home, which allows Haré and Guu to return to the jungle. The village elder, who is basically a hairball now, is found while Haré gets help with Ame thanks to Adult Guu and the three residents in Guu&#x27;s stomach. As life seems to go back to normal for Haré (as normal as life with Guu can be), assassins hired by Weda&#x27;s siblings show up to kill her because of a new discovery that Weda was included in a later version of her father&#x27;s will, entitling her to a part of the family fortune. Dama returns as one of the assassins hired to kill Weda, but Robert manages to talk her into going back to life with her husband. After seven attempts onher life, Weda resolves to go to the city to bring the fight to her siblings.

Weda goes to the city to settle things, and she brings all the kids from the jungle with her. They first run into trouble when two more assassins, Alex and Shirly, cause their plane to crash on an island. The two beg for their lives in front of Robert. On the island, they meet a muscle man named QP who becomes a rival to Robert and a bodyguard for Weda. When they get off the island they return to Weda&#x27;s family&#x27;s mansion where everyone makes plans to go to school.

At school, Haré reunites with Rita who has matured very much. So has Yohan who still has anger and hatred towards Haré. Toposte takes over his class and becomes almost a god to the other students. He was just being controlled by his chest hair and is saved when Haré removes it. Later, Guu gets a stomachache and Haré goes into her stomach to find the problem. He finds himself back in the RPG world where he discovers Guu has eaten the Baka Couple and Grandma Dama. She also ate Dama&#x27;s sister Tama who tells them the whole story behind her and her sister. Upon returning, Haré meets his aunt, uncle, and cousin. Weda makes up with her siblings but Haré and his cousin, Alva, still fight.

Guu is kidnapped by Haré and Guu — from a half year in the future — who came to find Dama and her sister. Haré, Guu, and their future counterparts find the two, but it is too late. They had already merged and become a giant monster, seeking to destroy the world. Haré and Guu are able to stop the monster, and Dama makes up with her sister. The story arc ends with everyone returning to the jungle. This time, Wigle stays in the city and Alva goes with everyone.

Weda returns everyone to the jungle. This time, they are bringing Haré&#x27;s cousin Alva with them. After some heartfelt goodbyes with their classmates, the kids of the jungle return home except for Wigle who stays to attend college. At first returning, Yumi-sensei is there waiting to have a passionate reunion with Toposte, who hides from her. It gets to the point where Toposte is not safe anywhere, so he fakes an illness to keep her away. But, because Yumi-sensei offered her life for his safety, Toposte realized how she cared for him and accepted and returned her love.

Alva isn&#x27;t used to the jungle so he sometimes gets lost and has to be returned by a very large pokute. Later, Haré and Guu decide to find where pokutes come from, learning that they reside in a dark cave deep in the jungle where they are also able to talk. They learn of the pokutes&#x27; relation with humans.

Gupta wants to reveal his love for Ravenna but he can&#x27;t get up the courage, so Guu goes with him for a practice date. This, of course, does not help at all. Then, with the urge to try to get Haré to love her, Mari takes him around to find how love really is, where they learn the true story behind the baka couple.

<doc id="548878" wikidata="Q3181819" url="?curid=548878" title="John Jacob Astor VI">
<text>John Jacob Astor VI (August 14, 1912 – June 26, 1992) was an American socialite, shipping businessman, and member of the Astor family. He was dubbed the &quot;&quot;Titanic&quot; Baby&quot; for his affiliation with the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;; Astor was born four months after his father, Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, died in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. His pregnant mother Madeleine Astor survived the sinking.

Astor was known for his legal battles with the estate of his elder half-brother, Vincent Astor, to inherit a larger portion of their father&#x27;s $85 million fortune (approximately $ billion in dollars). He was also known for his many engagements and four marriages to prominent society women.

==Early life==
John Jacob Astor VI (nicknamed &quot;Jakey&quot;) was born at 840 Fifth Avenue in New York City on August 14, 1912. He was the son of Colonel John Jacob Astor IV (nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot;) and socialite Madeleine Talmage Force. Jakey&#x27;s parents&#x27; marriage, on September 9, 1911, had sparked much controversy both because of their 29-year age difference, and because Colonel Astor had been divorced from his first wife, socialite Ava Lowle Willing, only one year earlier, on March 5, 1910.

The newlyweds were returning home aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot; after honeymooning in Egypt and Europe. Madeleine was five months pregnant with Jakey when her husband put her in one of the ship&#x27;s lifeboats. She was rescued two and half hours after her husband went down with the ship.

After Jack&#x27;s death, Madeleine raised their son at the Astors&#x27; Newport, Rhode Island, mansion, Beechwood, as part of the Astor family. She married banker William Karl Dick in 1916 and boxer Enzo Fiermonte in 1933. With Dick, she had two more sons: William Force Dick and John Henry Dick II. Fiermonte taught her sons boxing.

Astor, who had become close to Dick, strongly opposed the union with Fiermonte and repeatedly tried to convince his mother to end the relationship. This caused a rift between the two, though they reconciled within several months of the marriage. When asked if his mother was marrying Fiermonte, he responded, &quot;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true&quot;.

Astor graduated from St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island, and from Harvard University.

==Inheritance==

Under the terms of Colonel Astor&#x27;s will, Madeleine received relatively little of her husband&#x27;s $85 million estate (approximately $ billion in dollars). This included his estate in Rhinebeck and his yacht, the &quot;Noma&quot;. William Vincent Astor, the Colonel&#x27;s son from his first marriage, received $69 million (about $ billion in dollars), while the Colonel&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage, Ava Alice Muriel Astor, received a $10 million trust fund (about $ million in dollars).

The Colonel&#x27;s 19-year-old widow Madeleine received the annual income from a $5 million trust fund (about $ million in dollars), supplemented by an annual payment of $500,000 (about $ million in dollars), as well as use of his New York mansion at 65th Street &amp; Fifth Avenue, all its furnishings, and his Newport mansion Beechwood and all of its furnishings, the pick of whichever luxury limousine she wanted from his collection, and five of his prized horses, provided that she did not remarry. While not listed by name, his father&#x27;s will mentioned that any surviving child other than his children Vincent and Ava would receive a bequest of $3 million, to be held in trust until the child reached age 21. Jakey inherited the $3 million on his 21st birthday, which by that point had grown to $5 million (about $ million in dollars). When Madeleine died in late March 1940, she left him a diamond solitaire ring worth $50,000 (about $ in dollars) and a pearl necklace worth $1,525 (about $ in dollars).

Elder half-brother Vincent&#x27;s contempt for Madeleine led him to believe that Jakey was not even a biological Astor. Having despised his younger half-brother since birth, Vincent left him nothing in his will. Jakey felt cheated and said Vincent &quot;had the legal, not the moral, right to keep all the money&quot;. After Vincent died childless in February 1959, Jakey sued Vincent&#x27;s widow Roberta Brooke Russell for his inheritance. He was convinced that Vincent was &quot;mentally incompetent&quot; when signing his last will in June 1958 due to alcoholism, but Brooke insisted Vincent was &quot;fully competent&quot;. While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke often brought him liquor, and Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. He ended up settling for $250,000 (about $ million in dollars). The rest of the money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke.

== Personal life ==
Astor became engaged to Eileen Sherman Gillespie (1915–2008), the elder daughter of Lieutenant Lawrence Lewis Gillespie and Irene Muriel Augusta Sherman, in early December 1933. Irene&#x27;s parents were businessman William Watts Sherman of Duncan, Sherman &amp; Company and Sophia Augusta Brown. They planned to marry on February 6, 1934, but she called the wedding off on January 22 after a bitter argument. Heartbroken, Astor went to Shanghai shortly afterward to grieve, returning to America in early May 1934. He blamed her parents for interfering with the relationship. He once suggested they could reconcile, saying, &quot;I was willing to marry her, and if I were to think about it, I might still be willing to marry her.&quot; Eileen&#x27;s daughter Marguerite &quot;Margy&quot; Slocum later said of him: &quot;She felt that he had grown up lonely... He was a bit eccentric, and she felt he wasn&#x27;t mature enough to get married.&quot;

A few weeks after returning from Shanghai, Astor became engaged to Eileen&#x27;s close friend socialite Ellen Tuck &quot;Tucky&quot; French (1915–1974), the elder daughter of Francis Ormond &quot;Frank&quot; French II and Eleanor Livingston Burrill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francis/Eleanor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They married on June 30, 1934, at Trinity Church in Newport, Rhode Island. Tucky was a granddaughter of Amos Tuck French, and had been attracted to Jakey while he was engaged to Eileen. Tucky was to be a bridesmaid at Jakey and Eileen&#x27;s wedding. The couple had one son before divorcing in May 1943.

* William Backhouse Astor III (1935–2008), who was an investment banker. He married and later divorced Charlotte Ann Fisk (1936–2008), daughter of Earl Ellsworth Fisk and Florence Leavitt.

At the time of their son&#x27;s birth, Astor was working at the International Mercantile Marine Co.. Another of Tucky&#x27;s sisters, Virginia Middleton French (1917–2011), married William Force Dick, Astor&#x27;s half-brother through his mother, on December 18, 1941, before her marriage to Philip B. Pool. The two had respectively served as matron of honor and usher to Astor and Tucky&#x27;s wedding. Astor served as an usher and Tucky was matron of honor to Virginia and William&#x27;s wedding. Virginia and Vincent were appointed the godparents of William Backhouse Astor III.

On September 18, 1944, in New York City, Astor married for the second time, to Gertrude Gretsch (1923–1999), daughter of Walter and Gertrude B. Gretsch. Walter Gretsch was a son of businessman and industrialist Friedrich Gretsch, who founded the Gretsch manufacturing company. Astor and Gretsch divorced on August 2, 1954, after a four-year separation, though the Mexican divorce was ruled invalid in 1956. An American divorce soon followed. Before their separation and divorce, the couple had a daughter:

* Mary Jacqueline Astor (b. 1949), who married John Rozet Drexel IV (b. 1945), a son of John Rozet Drexel III and Mildred Sophia Noreen Stonor and 2x great-grandson of Anthony Joseph Drexel, in 1984. 

On August 6, 1954, Astor married for the third time, to Dolores Margaret &quot;Dolly&quot; Fullman (born c. 1928) in Arlington, Virginia. It was the 26-year-old Dolly&#x27;s second marriage. They separated soon after returning from their honeymoon and divorced.

Astor married his fourth and final wife, Sue Sandford, in 1956. They remained married until her death in 1985.

Astor died in Miami Beach, Florida, in 1992 at the age of 79. His body was returned to New York for burial with his parents in the Trinity Church Cemetery. He was survived by his son, daughter, three grandsons, and his youngest half-brother, John Dick.

===Descendants===

Through his son, Astor was a grandfather to two boys, William Backhouse Astor IV (b. 1959) and Gregory Todd Astor (b. 1966), who portrayed Colonel Astor in &quot;Titanic the Musical&quot; in April 2012. He was also a grandfather to Nicholas Astor Drexel through his daughter. Gregory and his wife Robin have three children: Alexandra Astor, Rebecca Charlotte Astor, and Stephen William Astor.

==Name confusion==
Even though some sources refer to Jakey as John Jacob V, John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever (1886–1971) was born first and therefore is actually John Jacob Astor V. Sir Jakie Astor (1918–2000), youngest brother of David Astor, was John Jacob Astor VII; the 3rd Baron Astor of Hever is John Jacob Astor VIII. Jakey is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as John Jacob III.

<text>Emil Dominik Josef Hácha (; 12 July 1872 – 27 June 1945) was a Czech lawyer, the president of Czechoslovakia from November 1938 to March 1939. In March 1939, after the breakup of Czechoslovakia, Hácha was the nominal president of the newly proclaimed German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

==Early life and legal career==
Emil Hácha was born on 12 July 1872 in the South Bohemian town of Trhové Sviny.

He graduated from a secondary school in České Budějovice and then applied for the law faculty at the University of Prague. After finishing his studies in 1896 (JUDr.) he worked for the Country Committee of the Kingdom of Bohemia in Prague (a self-government body with quite limited power). In 1902, Hácha married Marie Klausová (1873–1938). They had a daughter, Milada. Marie died ten months before Hácha became president.

Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, he became a judge at the Supreme Administrative Court in Vienna (the court was responsible for Cisleithania). He met there. After the Treaty of Versailles, Pantůček became President of the Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague, and Hácha became a judge (1918) and Deputy President (1919) of the court.

After Pantůček&#x27;s death in 1925, he was chosen by T. G. Masaryk as his successor, becoming first President of the Supreme Administration Court.

He became one of the most notable lawyers in Czechoslovakia, a specialist in English common law and international law. He was also a translator of English literature (most notably &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by Jerome K. Jerome), collector of art and a poet. His book &quot;Omyly a přeludy&quot; (&quot;Errors and Delusions&quot;) was published in 1939 anonymously, then later under his own name in 2001. He also became a member of the Legislative Council.

==President of Czechoslovakia==
===Second Czechoslovak Republic===
Following the Munich Agreement, Hácha was nominated as successor to Edvard Beneš on 30 November 1938 as President of Czechoslovakia. He was nominated because of his Catholicism, conservatism and lack of involvement in any of the governments that had led to the partition of the country.

The short era of his presidency before the German occupation is known as the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was marked by the shift from democracy to authoritarian state with an enabling act giving previously unusual powers to the president and government and restricting the powers of the parliament.

After the secession of Slovakia and Ruthenia in March 1939, British Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Basil Newton advised President Hácha to meet Hitler. When Hácha first arrived in Berlin, he first met with the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop prior to meeting with Hitler. Von Ribbentrop testified at the Nuremberg trials that during this meeting Hácha had told him that &quot;he wanted to place the fate of the Czech State in the Führer&#x27;s hands.&quot;

In the evening of 14 March 1939, Hitler summoned President Hácha to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Hitler deliberately kept him waiting for hours, while Hitler watched a film. Wilhelm Keitel in his memoirs recalled that when Hácha arrived Hitler said that &quot;he was going to let the old gentleman rest and recover for two hours,&quot; which was incomprehensible to Keitel. Finally, at 1:30 a.m., on 15 March 1939, Hitler saw the President. He told Hácha that as they were speaking, the German army was about to invade Czechoslovakia.

Hitler then gave the Czech President two options: cooperate with Germany, in which case the &quot;entry of German troops would take place in a tolerable manner&quot; and &quot;permit Czechoslovakia a generous life of her own, autonomy and a degree of national freedom...&quot; or face a scenario in which &quot;resistance would be broken by force of arms, using all means.&quot; Minutes of the conversation noted that for Hácha this was the most difficult decision of his life, but believed that in only a few years this decision would be comprehensible and in 50 years would probably be regarded as a blessing. According to Joachim Fest, Hácha suffered a heart attack induced by Göring&#x27;s threat to bomb the capital and by four o&#x27;clock he contacted Prague, effectively &quot;signing Czechoslovakia away&quot; to Germany. Göring acknowledged making the threat to the British ambassador to Germany, Nevile Henderson, but said that the threat came as a warning because the Czech government, after already agreeing to German occupation, couldn&#x27;t guarantee that the Czech army would not fire on the advancing Germans. Göring however does not mention that Hácha had a heart attack because of his threat. 

The French Ambassador Robert Coulondre reported that according to an unnamed source considered reliable by Coulondre, by half past four, Hácha was &quot;in a state of total collapse, and kept going only by means of injections.&quot; Coulondre described the scene at the Reich Chancellery:&quot;The German ministers [Göring and Ribbentrop] were pitiless. They literally hunted Dr. Hácha and M. Chvalkovsky round the table on which the documents were lying, thrusting them continually before them, pushing pens into their hands, incessantly repeating that if they continued in their refusal, half of Prague would lie in ruins from bombing within two hours, and that this would be only the beginning. Hundreds of bombers were waiting the order to take off, and they would receive that order at six in the morning if the signatures were not forthcoming&quot;.However, Hitler&#x27;s interpreter Paul Schmidt, who was present during the meeting, in his memoirs denied such turbulent scenes ever taking place with the Czechoslovak President. Jewish-American historian Jean Ancel noted that Schmidt&#x27;s memoirs are not a reliable source of information as he consistently downplayed and ignored the criminal policies of the Nazi regime as well as his own role in them.

===Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia===
After the occupation of the remnants of Czechoslovakia on 16 March, Hácha retained his office as President, but was forced to swear an oath to Hitler, who appointed Konstantin von Neurath as Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. During his time as President of the Protectorate, Hácha also signed into law legislation modeled after the Nazi Nuremberg Laws that discriminated against Czech Jews. He dissolved the parliament, replacing it with the National Partnership.

Hácha&#x27;s situation changed on 29 September 1941, when Reinhard Heydrich was appointed Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, as Neurath had been considered not harsh enough by Hitler. Hácha lost all remaining influence over political affairs in his country and became a puppet. Many of his colleagues and friends were arrested (including the Prime Minister Alois Eliáš) and shot or sent to Nazi concentration camps.

After the assassination of Heydrich, the new Deputy Protector became Kurt Daluege. Hitler had originally planned to murder 10,000 Czechs in reprisal for the murder of Heydrich and warned Hácha that if another such incident occurred, &quot;we should have to consider deporting the whole Czech population&quot;. This threat was made at Heydrich&#x27;s funeral.

===Capture, torture and death===
On 9 May 1945, Prague was captured by the Red Army during the Prague offensive. Hácha was brutally beaten and arrested by NKVD agents on 13 May and transferred immediately to Pankrác Prison. He died in prison on 27 June 1945 under mysterious circumstances. After his death, he was buried at first in an unmarked grave at the Vinohrady Cemetery (though now there is a marker present on his grave).

<doc id="548883" wikidata="Q5630021" url="?curid=548883" title="HK Magazine">
<text>HK Magazine was a free English-language alternative weekly published by HK Magazine Media Group in Hong Kong. Launched in 1991, it offered coverage of local affairs, social issues as well as entertainment listings. The 1000th issue was published in 2013, the same year that it was sold to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; (SCMP) group. The magazine printed its final issue on 7 October 2016. This was the third SCMP subsidiary to close since the takeover of the newspaper by the Alibaba Group.

==History==
&quot;HK Magazine&quot; was founded by best friends Greg Duncan, Stephen Freeman and Gretchen Worth. In 1989, considering Hong Kong a suitable place to start a magazine, they decided to establish an English-language publication.

The first issue, called &quot;HK: the indispensable Hong Kong Guide&quot;, was published in June 1991 by the local private company Asia City Publishing Limited. It had 24 pages and claimed a circulation of 15,000. It continued to publish on a monthly basis until November 1992, when because of the ambiguity of the name and the change of the publisher&#x27;s schedule, the magazine was renamed &quot;HK Magazine&quot;, and switched to a bi-weekly schedule for the next three years.

In September 1995, it became a weekly magazine.

On 27 March 2009, the magazine allowed the publication of an article from its columnist, writer Chip Tsao. His article &quot;War at Home&quot; alleges the Philippines to be a nation of servants and also claims China is the master. This triggered a massive outcry from the Filipino community in Hong Kong and outraged many across the Philippines. Tsao made a public apology three days later on 30 March 2009.

In 2013, it was reported that Asia City Media Group had sold its Hong Kong business, including HK Magazine and other titles, to &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; for a sum of HK$13 million. &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, including &quot;HK Magazine&quot;, was sold to Alibaba Group in early 2016.

==Distribution==
The magazine, which was audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, was free at around 900 venues including restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bookshops and retail stores. The distribution outlets were mostly concentrated in commercial business districts.

==Readership==
The magazine claimed around 236,000 readers per week.

According to a survey conducted by &quot;HK Magazine&quot; in 2004, 87% of the readers were holders of at least one university degree and 75% earned more than HK$30,000 per month. (&quot;Source: HK Magazine 2004 Readership Survey, HK Magazine 2004 Distribution Survey&quot;).

==Contents==
&quot;HK Magazine&quot; usually contained features about social issues, and articles about music, movies, fashion, dining and travel, etc. The main sections that appeared regularly in the magazine were:

* Upfront – The opening pages of the magazine, featuring humorous and usually satirical commentaries on current affairs.
* Letters – Letters from readers. There may be comments or thoughts about past issues of the magazine or opinions towards social issue, etc.
* Street talk – Interviews with ordinary Hong Kong people on their lifestyle and working environment, of persons of interest around town coinciding with special events they are taking part in.
* Features – Generally, there are two features in each issue, both covering local issues and sometimes foreign issues. The first one is usually on social, political and cultural issues and events. The second one usually covers events in everyday life.
* 852 – This section, named for Hong Kong&#x27;s IDD code, is split into four sub-categories: Shopping, Dining, Travel, and Healthy and Beauty, with selected new items featured under Shopping, as well as resident weekly columnists each writing under last three sections. 852 also features reviews on restaurants around town every week, written anonymously. 
* Listings – There are three different categories in this section:

==Publisher==
&quot;HK Magazine&quot; was published by the HK Magazine Media Group. Established on 10 February 1989 in Hong Kong, it produces a portfolio of free city living publications. Formerly known as Lucky Still Limited, the corporation changed its name to Asia City Publishing Limited on 23 May 1989; it underwent another name change to become Asia City Media Group in the 2000s. In 2013 it was acquired by &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; and named HK Magazine Media Group. It introduces new lifestyle to readers in different regions through an extensive portfolio of publications.

Others titles also published under HK Magazine Media Group are as follows.

*&quot;Where Hong Kong&quot;, an edition of the international travel magazine with titles in major cities and countries across the globe
*&quot;Where Chinese&quot;, catered to visitors from Mainland China and published in simplified Chinese characters
*&quot;The List&quot;, a bi-weekly women&#x27;s magazine. Featuring a different theme every issue, the magazine offers an extensive listings section called &quot;Know and Tel&quot; where readers will find useful information, addresses and phone numbers for different shops and companies alike.

==Closure==
On 28 September 2016 &quot;The South China Morning Post&quot; announced that the magazine&#x27;s final issue would be released on 7 October 2016. This was the third SCMP subsidiary to close since the Alibaba Group takeover of the newspaper in early 2016, the first two being the &quot;48 HOURS&quot; weekend magazine and the SCMP Chinese language edition. SCMP stated that some &quot;HK Magazine&quot; staff members might be reassigned within the SCMP group while &quot;around five&quot; may be laid off.

The closure of the magazine was mourned in Hong Kong as the loss of a &quot;fun, independent and free-thinking&quot; publication that blended entertainment listings with coverage of social and issues, such as Hong Kong&#x27;s relationship with mainland China and LGBT rights. SCMP&#x27;s decision to discontinue the publication has been viewed as part of a wider effort under Alibaba management to shift focus away from Hong Kong and onto mainland China, and to market that coverage to western readers overseas. The Alibaba acquisition of the newspaper aims to promote China in the west, with the group&#x27;s executive vice chairman stating that foreigners &quot;don’t really understand China and have the wrong perception of China&quot;. It has been noted that the &quot;Post&quot;, once famed for pursuing stories banned in mainland China, has become &quot;markedly less critical of Beijing&quot; in recent years.

Zach Hines, who worked at the magazine from 2005–2015 (serving as editor-in-chief from 2008), wrote of the closure:

&quot;The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; purchased us at the right time, and for sensible reasons. The media landscape was changing dramatically, as it continues to do, and their ownership bought us a few final years of life. But, like “One Country, Two Systems,” this odd and uncomfortable marriage was never going to last.

To be a truly independent press, you cannot be beholden to anyone except your readers. But, to my great dismay, this is becoming an increasing impossibility in Hong Kong, in both the mainstream Chinese and much-smaller English media. The SCMP itself is now owned by Alibaba, perhaps the biggest pro-China organization in the world, if you don’t count the Communist Party. The paper’s business interests are also drifting away from Hong Kong, and toward readers in the United States and the rest of the west. HK Magazine is a canary in the coal mine. [...]

As this sad end to HK Magazine shows, it is clear that it is time now for someone else to step up and provide an alternative voice for Hong Kong. If you care about free speech and the liberal values that make Hong Kong what it is, say something about it. Do something about it. Support independent outlets like &quot;Hong Kong Free Press&quot; and FactWire. You have a voice. Use it. Or you will surely lose it.&quot;

Initially SCMP stated that the &quot;HK Magazine&quot; website would be deleted from the internet. This received strong condemnation. The Hong Kong Journalists Association lodged an inquiry with SCMP management. Hines stated: &quot;It is unthinkable that a newspaper of record would ever consider deleting content from its archive. The SCMP should be held to proper journalistic standards. HK Magazine was an important feature of Hong Kong’s media landscape, and it must be preserved. Deleting it would be an utter travesty of journalistic principles – and a slap in the face to SCMP’s readers and to Hong Kong society in general.&quot;

Following the negative reaction SCMP stated that &quot;HK Magazine&quot; content would be migrated to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; website before the &quot;HK Magazine&quot; website was deleted. Additionally, Hong Kong data scientist Mart van de Ven launched a public appeal to help archive back issues of the magazine, expressing doubt that SCMP would preserve the full archive. He found that he was unable to access issue 1,103, which featured Leung Chun-ying on the cover.

<text>Sergey Ivanovich Ozhegov (; 22 September 1900 – 15 December 1964) was a Russian Soviet lexicographer, linguist and professor. In 1926 he graduated from the Leningrad University where his teachers included Lev Shcherba and Viktor Vinogradov.

==Biography==
In 1935–1940, Ozhegov contributed to Dmitry Ushakov&#x27;s four-volume explanatory dictionary of the Russian language. His main piece of work, the &quot;Dictionary of the Russian Language&quot; (&quot;&quot;), as updated and corrected by Natalia Shvedova, is the most widely used reference for the Russian language today.

Ozhegov also ran the Russian Language Institute as part of the Russian Academy of Sciences to oversee and advise on the correct spelling, grammar and pronunciation of the Russian language. His work was widely recognized in the Soviet Union and he was accorded burial at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

Ozhegov was not without his detractors, especially among Russian émigrés. Vladimir Nabokov, for instance, compared his dictionary with that of Vladimir Dahl unfavorably and, in his novel &quot;Ada or Ardor&quot;, even called it &quot;moronic&quot;.

<text>William Matthews (born July 22, 1947) is a Canadian politician.

==Political career==
Matthews was a Progressive Conservative member of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from 1982 to 1996. During this time, he was a cabinet minister, as Minister of Culture, Recreation and Youth from 1985 to 1988 and Minister of Career Development and Advanced Studies from 1988 to 1989.

Matthews was later elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1997 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, representing the riding of Burin—St. George&#x27;s. He crossed the floor to the Liberals in 1999, and continued to represent the riding until 2004. In that year&#x27;s federal election, he was elected to the newly redistributed district of Random—Burin—St. George&#x27;s, which he represented until 2008.

Matthews is a former teacher. He is a former Parliamentary Secretary to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Deputy House Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, and Progressive Conservative critic of Fisheries and Oceans.

In March 2007, Matthews called Prime Minister Stephen Harper a &quot;liar.&quot; While Speaker of the House Peter Milliken didn&#x27;t give in to demands from outraged Tories to throw Matthews out of the chamber, Milliken did not allow Matthews to rise in the House for what would be the last 14 months of Matthews&#x27; career. Matthews did not run for reelection in the 2008 election.

In October 2018, Matthews was appointed as Chief of Staff to provincial PC leader Ches Crosbie in the Opposition Office.

Matthews contested the 2019 provincial election as the PC candidate in Burin-Grand Bank, but was defeated by Liberal incumbent Carol Anne Haley.

<doc id="548889" wikidata="Q326499" url="?curid=548889" title="Vladimir Dal">
<text>Vladimir Ivanovich Dal (, ; 22 November 1801 – 4 October 1872) was a Russian lexicographer, speaker of many languages, Turkologist, and founding member of the Russian Geographical Society. During his lifetime he compiled and documented the oral history of the region that was later published in Russian and became part of modern folklore.

==Early life==
Vladimir Dal&#x27;s father was a Danish physician named Johan Christian von Dahl (1764 – October 21, 1821), a linguist versed in the German, English, French, Russian, Yiddish, Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages. His mother, Julia Adelaide Freytag, had German and probably French (Huguenot) ancestry; she spoke at least five languages and came from a family of scholars.

The future lexicographer was born in the town of Lugansky Zavod (present-day Luhansk, Ukraine), in Novorossiya – then under the jurisdiction of Yekaterinoslav Governorate, part of the Russian Empire. (The settlement of Lugansky Zavod dated from the 1790s.) Dal grew up under the influence of varied mixture of people and cultures which existed in that area.
Dal served in the Imperial Russian Navy from 1814 to 1826, graduating from the Saint Petersburg Naval Cadet School in 1819. In 1826 he began studying medicine at Dorpat University; he participated as a military doctor in the Russo-Turkish War and in the campaign against Poland in 1831–1832. Following disagreement with his superiors, he resigned from the Military Hospital in Saint Petersburg and took an administrative position with the Ministry of the Interior in Orenburg Governorate in 1833. He took part in General Perovsky&#x27;s military expedition against Khiva of 1839-1840. Dal then served in administrative positions in Saint Petersburg (1841–1849) and in Nizhny Novgorod (from 1849) before his retirement in 1859.

Dal had an interest in language and folklore from his early years. He started traveling by foot through the countryside, collecting sayings and fairy tales in various Slavic languages from the region. He published his first collection of fairy-tales () in 1832. Dal&#x27;s friend Alexander Pushkin (1799–1837) put some other tales, yet unpublished, into verse. They have become some of the most familiar texts in the Russian language. After Pushkin&#x27;s fatal duel in January 1837, Dal was summoned to his deathbed and looked after the great poet during the last hours of his life. In 1838 Dal was elected to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.

==Lexicographic studies==
In the following decade, Dal adopted the pen name Kazak Lugansky (&quot;Cossack from Luhansk&quot;) and published several realistic essays in the manner of Nikolai Gogol. He continued his lexicographic studies and extensive travels throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Having no time to edit his collection of fairy tales, he asked Alexander Afanasyev to prepare them for publication, which followed in the late 1850s. Joachim T. Baer wrote:
While Dal was a skilled observer, he lacked talent in developing a story and creating psychological depth for his characters. He was interested in the wealth of the Russian language, and he began collecting words while still a student in the Naval Cadet School. Later he collected and recorded fairy tales, folk songs, birch bark woodcuts, and accounts of superstitions, beliefs, and prejudices of the Russian people. His industry in the sphere of collecting was prodigious.
His magnum opus, &quot;Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language&quot;, was published in four huge volumes in 1863–1866. &quot;The Sayings and Bywords of the Russian people&quot;, featuring more than 30,000 entries, followed several years later. Both books have been reprinted innumerable number of times. Baer says: &quot;While an excellent collector, Dal had some difficulty ordering his material, and his so-called alphabet-nest system was not completely satisfactory until Baudouin de Courtenay revised it thoroughly in the third (1903–1910) and fourth (1912–1914) editions of the &quot;Dictionary&quot;.&quot;

Dal was a strong proponent of the native rather than adopted vocabulary. His dictionary began to have a strong influence on literature at the beginning of the 20th century; in his 1911 article &quot;Poety russkogo sklada&quot; (&quot;Poets of the Russian Mold&quot;), Maximilian Voloshin wrote: 
Just about the first of the contemporary poets who began to read Dal was Vyacheslav Ivanov. In any case, contemporary poets of the younger generation, under his influence, subscribed to the new edition of Dal. The discovery of the verbal riches of the Russian language was for the reading public like studying a completely new foreign language. Both old and popular Russian words seemed gems for which there was absolutely no place in the usual ideological practice of the intelligentsia, in that habitual verbal comfort in simplified speech, composed of international elements.
While studying at Cambridge, Vladimir Nabokov bought a copy of Dal&#x27;s dictionary and read at least ten pages every evening, &quot;jotting down such words and expressions as might especially please me&quot;; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn took a volume of Dal with him as his only book when he was sent to the prison camp at Ekibastuz. The encompassing nature of Dal&#x27;s dictionary gives it critical linguistic importance even today, especially because a large proportion of the dialectal vocabulary he collected has since passed out of use. The dictionary served as a base for Vasmer&#x27;s , the most comprehensive Slavic etymological lexicon.

For his great dictionary Dal was honoured by the Lomonosov Medal, the Constantine Medal (1863) and an honorary fellowship in the Russian Academy of Sciences.

He is interred at the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow. To mark the 200th anniversary of Vladimir Dal&#x27;s birthday, UNESCO declared the year 2000 The International Year of Vladimir Dal.

==Legacy==
* In 1986 a museum in Moscow, Russia, was opened in honor of Dal.
* In Luhansk, Ukraine, the home of Dal has been converted into a Literary Museum where the employees managed to collect the lifetime editions of Dal&#x27;s complete literary works.
* In 2001, a Luhansk (Ukraine) university was named after Dal, the East Ukrainian Volodymyr Dahl National University (from his name in Ukrainian).
* In 2017, the State Literary Museum in Moscow, Russia received a new official name: the State Museum of the History of Russian Literature named after V. I. Dal.
* On November 22, 2017, Google celebrated his 216th birthday with a Google Doodle.

==Damascus affair==
Dal served in the Ministry of Domestic Affairs. His responsibilities included overseeing investigations of murders of children in the western part of Russia.

In 1840, the Damascus affair had resulted in the accusation that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes, and Nicholas I instructed his officials, especially Vladimir Dal, to thoroughly investigate the claim. In 1844, just 10 copies of a 100-page report, intended only for the Czar and senior officials, were submitted. The paper was entitled &quot;Investigation on the Murder of Christian Children by the Jews and the Use of Their Blood.&quot; The document stated although the vast majority of Jews had not even heard of ritual murder, such murders and the use of blood for magical purposes were committed by sects of fanatical Hasidic Jews. While the paper is often attributed to Dal, the question of the authorship (or multiple authorships) remains contested.

In 1914, 42 years after Dal&#x27;s death, during the blood libel trial of Menahem Mendel Beilis in Kyiv, the then 70-year-old report was published in Saint Petersburg under the title &quot;Notes on Ritual Murders&quot;. The name of the author was not stated in this new edition, intended for the general public.

<doc id="548892" wikidata="Q370111" url="?curid=548892" title="Flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>There is currently no official flag for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The federation is part of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The federation adopted its own flag in 1996, but the flag and associated coat of arms were deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2007 and now it is considered to be a &quot;de facto&quot; flag. The federation has not yet adopted a new flag, anthem or coat of arms; instead the symbols of the central state are used for official purposes as a provisional solution.

==Former flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1996–2007)==

A flag was adopted by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 November 1996. On the flag, green stood for the Bosniaks and red for the Bosnian Croats. The same went for the coat of arms, whereon the green arms and golden fleur-de-lis stood for the Bosniaks and the chequy shield for Bosnian Croats. The ten stars arranged in a circle, although they resemble those on the European flag, represented the 10 cantons of the Federation.

===Decision of the constitutional court===

On 12 April 2004, Sulejman Tihić, then Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the review of constitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on the Coat of Arms and Flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (&quot;Official Gazette of Federation of BiH No. 21/96 and 26/96&quot;), Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitutional Law on the Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem of the Republika Srpska (&quot;Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska No. 19/92&quot;), Articles 2 and 3 of the Law on the Use of Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem (&quot;Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska No. 4/93&quot;) and Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on the Family Patron-Saint&#x27;s Days and Church Holidays of the Republika Srpska (&quot;Official Gazette of Republika Srpska No. 19/92&quot;). On 2 December 2004 the applicant submitted a supplement to the request. Two partial decisions were made in a year 2006, when the Court found that the coat of arms and flag of the Federation of B&amp;H, and coat of arms, anthem, family patron-saint days and church holidays of Republika Srpska were unconstitutional. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

The formal name of the item is &quot;U-4/04&quot;, but it is widely known as &quot;Decision on the insignia of entities&quot; (Bosnian: &quot;Odluka o obilježjima entiteta&quot;), since its meritum was about the symbols of entities. The Court has ordered the Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the National Assembly of Republika Srpska to bring the contested legal documents in line with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina within six months from the publishing date of its decision in the &quot;Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;. Since the harmonisation was not done in that granted time-limit, that Court has, on 27 January 2007, adopted the Ruling on failure to enforce in which it established that the contested articles of the interpreted legal documents shall cease to be in force as of the date following the publishing date of the Ruling in &quot;Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;.

On 31 March 2007, the Constitutional Court placed its decision into the &quot;Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot; officially removing the flag and coat of arms of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<doc id="548896" wikidata="Q571381" url="?curid=548896" title="National Invitation Tournament">
<text>The National Invitation Tournament (NIT) is an annual men&#x27;s college basketball tournament operated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since 2023, all rounds of the tournament are played at various sites across the country which are selected annually. From its founding in 1938 to 2022, the semifinals and finals were always played at Madison Square Garden (MSG) in New York City. Predating the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament by one year, the NIT was considered the most prestigious post-season showcase for college basketball before its status was superseded in the mid-1950s by the NCAA tournament.

A second, much more recent &quot;NIT&quot; tournament is played in November and known as the NIT Season Tip-Off. Formerly the &quot;Preseason NIT&quot; (and still sometimes referred to as such colloquially), it was founded in 1985. Unlike the postseason NIT, its final rounds are played at Madison Square Garden. Both tournaments were operated by the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Association (MIBA) until 2005, when they were purchased by the NCAA, and the MIBA disbanded.

Unless otherwise qualified, the terms &quot;NIT&quot; or &quot;National Invitation Tournament&quot; refer to the post-season tournament in both common and official use.

==History==
===Founding===
The post-season National Invitation Tournament was founded in 1938 by the Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association, one year after the NAIA tournament was created by basketball&#x27;s inventor Dr. James Naismith, and one year before the NCAA tournament. The first NIT was won by the Temple University Owls over the Colorado Buffaloes.

Responsibility for the NIT&#x27;s administration was transferred in 1940 to the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Committee, a body of local New York colleges: Fordham University, Manhattan University, New York University, St. John&#x27;s University, and Wagner College. This became the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Association (MIBA) in 1948.

Originally the tournament invited a field of six teams, with all games played at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.

The field was expanded to eight teams in 1941, 12 in 1949, 14 in 1965, 16 in 1968, 24 in 1979, 32 in 1980, and 40 from 2002 through 2006. From 2007 to 2019 and since 2022, the tournament reverted to the current 32-team format; 2021 saw the field cut to 16 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where no games were scheduled the year before.

===Early advantages over the NCAA tournament===
In its earliest years, before 1950, the NIT offered some advantages over the NCAA tournament:
* There was limited national media coverage of college basketball in the 1930s and 1940s, and playing all of its games in New York City provided teams greater media exposure, both with the general public and among high school prospects in its rich recruiting territory. The NCAA also staged its eastern regional final in New York City from 1943 through 1950, as well as its Final Four from 1943 through 1948.
* Until 1950, the NCAA tournament selection committee invited only one team each from eight national regions, potentially leaving better quality selections and natural rivals out of its field, which would opt for the NIT.

===Prestige===
From its onset and at least into the mid-1950s, the NIT was regarded as the most prestigious showcase for college basketball. All-American at Princeton and later NBA champion with the New York Knicks and United States Senator Bill Bradley stated:

Several teams played in both the NIT and NCAA tournaments in the same year, beginning with Colorado and Duquesne in 1940. Colorado won the NIT in 1940 but subsequently finished fourth in the NCAA West Region. In 1944, Utah lost its first game in the NIT but then proceeded to win not only the NCAA tournament, but also the subsequent Red Cross War Charities benefit game in which they defeated NIT champion St. John&#x27;s at Madison Square Garden. In 1949, some Kentucky players were bribed by gamblers to lose their first round game in the NIT. This same Kentucky team went on to win the NCAA. In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and remains the only school to accomplish that feat because of an NCAA committee change in the early 1950s prohibiting a team from competing in both tournaments.

The champions of both the NCAA and NIT tournaments played each other for three seasons during World War II. From 1943 to 1945, the American Red Cross sponsored a postseason charity game between each year&#x27;s tournament champions to raise money for the war effort. The series was described by Ray Meyer as not just benefit games, but as &quot;really the games for the national championship&quot;. The NCAA champion prevailed in all three games.

The Helms Athletic Foundation retrospectively selected the NIT champion as its national champion for 1938 (Temple) and chose the NIT champion over the NCAA champion once, in 1939 (Long Island). More recently, the mathematically based Premo-Porretta Power Poll published in the &quot;ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia&quot; retrospectively ranked teams for each season prior to 1949, the year in which the Associated Press poll was implemented. For the period when the tournaments overlapped between 1939 and 1948, Premo-Porretta ranked the NIT champion ahead of the NCAA champion twice (1939 and 1941) and the NCAA champion ahead of the NIT champion eight times. Between 1939 and 1970, when teams could compete in either tournament, only DePaul (1945), Utah (1947), San Francisco (1949) and Holy Cross (1954) claim or celebrate national championships for their teams based solely on an NIT championship, although Long Island recognizes its selection as the 1939 national champion by Helms Athletic Foundation, which was made retrospectively in 1943.

In 1943 the NCAA tournament moved to share Madison Square Garden with the NIT in an effort to increase the credibility of the NCAA Tournament. In 1945, &quot;The New York Times&quot; indicated that many teams could get bids to enter either tournament, which was not uncommon in that day. Since the mid-1950s, the NCAA tournament has been popularly regarded by most institutions as the pre-eminent postseason tournament, with conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it.

Nevertheless, as late as 1970, Coach Al McGuire of Marquette, the 8th-ranked team in the final AP poll of the season, spurned an NCAA at-large invitation because the Warriors were going to be placed in the NCAA Midwest Regional (Fort Worth, Texas) instead of closer to home in the Mideast Regional (Dayton, Ohio). The team played in the NIT instead, which it won. This led the NCAA to decree in 1971 that any school to which it offered a bid must accept it or be prohibited from participating in postseason competition, reducing the pool of teams that could accept an NIT invitation.

===Decline===
As the NCAA tournament expanded its field to include more teams, the reputation of the NIT suffered. In 1973, NBC moved televised coverage of the NCAA championship from Saturday afternoon to Monday evening, providing the NCAA Tournament with prime-time television exposure the NIT could not match. Even more crucially, when the NCAA eliminated the one-team-per-conference rule in 1975, its requirement that teams accept its bids relegated the NIT to a collection of teams that did not make the NCAA grade.

Compounding this, to cut costs, the NIT moved its early rounds out of Madison Square Garden in 1977, playing games at home sites until the later rounds. This further harmed the NIT&#x27;s prestige, both regionalizing interest in it and marginalizing it by reducing its association with Madison Square Garden. By the mid-1980s, its transition to a secondary tournament for lesser teams was complete.

===NCAA takes control===
In 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association purchased 10-year rights to the NIT from the MIBA for $56.5 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit, which had gone to trial and was being argued until very shortly before the settlement was announced. The MIBA alleged that compelling teams to accept invitations to the NCAA tournament even if they preferred to play in the NIT was an illegal use of the NCAA&#x27;s powers. In addition, it argued that the NCAA&#x27;s expansion of its tournament to 65 teams (68 since 2011) was designed specifically to bankrupt the NIT. Faced with the very real possibility of being found in violation of federal antitrust law for the third time in its history, the NCAA chose to settle (the first two violations were related to restrictions on televising college football and capping assistant coach salaries). As part of the purchase of the NIT by the NCAA, the MIBA disbanded.

The 2020 edition of the NIT was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, following the NCAA canceling all winter and spring sports for that year in its wake. In 2021, the NIT, like March Madness, decided to play its games at a bubble location, this time being Denton and Frisco, Texas, therefore for the first time the semifinals and championship were not played at Madison Square Garden. After a return to MSG in 2022, it was announced that the 2023 and 2024 semis and final would be moved away from New York. On August 12, 2022, the NCAA announced that the final rounds of the 2023 NIT would be held at Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada and hosted by nearby UNLV, and the 2024 site would be Butler University&#x27;s Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.

===Reputation===
The status of the post-season National Invitation Tournament as a &quot;consolation&quot; fixture has led to something of a stigma in the minds of many fans. When teams with tenuous hopes of an NCAA Tournament berth lose away from home late in the season, opposing fans may taunt the players in the closing seconds with chants of &quot;NIT! NIT!&quot; This is done regardless of whether the home team is headed for the NCAA Tournament or not. Irv Moss, a journalist for the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, once wrote of such a taunt to a defeated team, &quot;The three-letter word ... was far more cutting than any four-letter word they could have hollered.&quot;

Because the post-season NIT consists of teams that failed to receive a berth in the NCAA Tournament, the NIT has been nicknamed the &quot;Not Invited Tournament&quot;, &quot;Not Important Tournament&quot;, &quot;Never Important Tournament&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Interested Tournament&quot;, &quot;Needs Improvement Tournament&quot;, &quot;No Important Team&quot;, &quot;National Insignificant Tournament,&quot; or simply &quot;Not In Tournament&quot;. It has also been called a tournament to see who the &quot;69th best team&quot; in the country is (since there are now 68 teams in the NCAA Tournament).

David Thompson, an All-American player from North Carolina State, called the NIT &quot;a loser&#x27;s tournament&quot; in 1975. NC State, which had been the previous year&#x27;s NCAA champion, refused to play in the tournament that year, following the precedent set by ACC rival Maryland the previous season after losing the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game to the top-ranked Wolfpack. In succeeding years, other teams such as Oklahoma State, Louisville, Georgia Tech, Georgetown, and LSU have declined to play in the NIT when they did not make the NCAA tournament. One such team was Maryland; after being rejected by the NCAA selection committee in 2006, head coach Gary Williams announced that 19–11 Maryland would not go to the NIT, only to be told that the university had previously agreed to use Comcast Center as a venue for the NIT. The Terrapins were eliminated in the first round by the Manhattan University Jaspers. In 2008, however, Williams announced that if invited, the Terps would play, because it would serve as a chance to further develop six freshman players on his squad and to give senior forward James Gist more exposure. At UCLA&#x27;s Pauley Pavilion, there are individual championship banners for all 11 NCAA titles; there hung a banner for UCLA&#x27;s 1985 NIT championship until the 1995 NCAA championship banner replaced it. However, during the recent remodeling of Pauley Pavilion a plaque was installed along the concourse of the building commemorating the Bruins&#x27; 1985 NIT Championship.

For other teams, however, the NIT is perceived as a step up, helping programs progress from mediocrity or obscurity to prominence, and the response is more enthusiastic. For example, at the University of Tulsa, which won the NIT in 1981 and 2001, the Golden Hurricane&#x27;s NIT &quot;championship tradition&quot; is viewed with pride and as a &quot;lure&quot; for players to join the program. The University of Connecticut also regards the NIT as the beginning of its success. The NIT is also held in generally higher regard than the newer tournaments that have debuted since 2008 (the current College Basketball Crown, College Basketball Invitational, and CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament, plus The Basketball Classic and the Vegas 16, which both folded after only one edition). St. Bonaventure, a school that, since 2014, has a policy of refusing to play in those newer tournaments, still accepted bids to the NIT, if invited. In 2024, St. Bonaventure declined an NIT invitation despite head coach Mark Schmidt indicating he wanted his team to play in the NIT. Five days later, athletic director Joe Manhertz resigned amidst controversy regarding the opt-out decision.

St. Bonaventure was not alone in declining an NIT bid, but only Memphis accompanied them as a non-power conference team. Most schools rejecting an invitation consisted of teams from major conferences, including two teams among the first four out in Oklahoma and Pitt.

The NIT Season Tip-Off carries none of the postseason tournament&#x27;s stigma and is one of many popular season-opening tournaments held every year around the country (alongside events such as the Maui Invitational and the now-defunct Great Alaska Shootout).

==Selection process==
In the past, NIT teams were selected in consultation with ESPN, the television home of the NIT. The goal of the NIT was to sustain the MIBA financially. Therefore, schools selected to play in the NIT were often major conference teams with records near .500 that had large television fan bases and would likely have a respectable attendance for tournament games on their home court. The latter is one reason why New Mexico was invited virtually every year—the Lobos often had a winning season but failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament. Seeding considerations and home court advantage included the number of fans willing to show up to each game. In an effort to maintain some quality, a rule saying that a team must have a .500 or better overall record to qualify for the NIT was imposed.

The NCAA announced a revamped selection process starting with the 2017 tournament. The main highlights are:
*Teams are no longer required to have .500 or greater overall records to receive bids.
*Similar to the automatic bids the NCAA Tournament grants for all conference tournament champions, all teams that won regular-season conference championships but failed to earn NCAA tournament bids are guaranteed places in the NIT.

In addition, the selection process was changed. ESPN no longer had a hand in the selection of the teams. Instead, a committee of former NCAA head coaches, chaired by Newton, and including Gene Keady (Purdue), Don DeVoe (Tennessee), Rudy Davalos, Les Robinson (NC State), Reggie Minton (Air Force), John Powers, and Carroll Williams among others, prepared a list of potential teams in advance.

Beginning with the 2016 NIT, the committee makeup was restructured; committee members will serve a maximum four-year term, and the committee will feature a mix of current athletics administrators who are actively working at NCAA schools or conferences and former head college basketball coaches. Previously, the NIT Committee had eight members, all of whom had been former head college basketball coaches or athletics directors. The previous structure had no term limits or succession plan.

ESPN continues to provide television coverage of the tournament. In 2011 the NCAA and ESPN agreed to a $500 million agreement through 2023–24 for rights to cover championships in several sports, including the NIT; this compares with the 11-year, $6.2 billion TV contract with CBS and Turner Sports for the NCAA tournament.

These changes are intended to encourage participation by good college teams that would rather stay home than play in the NIT—to make it the &quot;Little Dance&quot; instead of the &quot;loser&#x27;s tournament&quot;. Former NIT Committee chair and former Alabama and Vanderbilt head coach C. M. Newton stated, &quot;What we want to have is a true basketball event, a real tournament, one where there&#x27;s no preconceived ideas of who gets to New York. We&#x27;d love to have great crowds, but this is not a financial consideration. We want good television coverage, but we&#x27;re not going to play this thing for television and move games around&quot;.
 Another consideration is that a number one-seeded team that goes to the semifinals will have three home games, which helps ticket sales.

From 2007 to 2019, the 32-team field used from 1980 through 2001 is the same, eliminating the eight-game &quot;play-in&quot; opening round where teams played to qualify for second round games against the top eight seeds used 2002–2006. The tournament features four eight-team regions. There&#x27;s one exception: 16 teams competed in 2021. For the first time since 2011, the format prevented the tournament from extending the NIT&#x27;s automatic bid to any regular-season conference champion that did not make the NCAA&#x27;s field of 68 (Ohio Valley Conference champion Belmont was not invited). Seven teams earned an NIT bid that way in 2006.

A new attendance record for an NIT game was set at Syracuse University&#x27;s Carrier Dome on March 19, 2007, at the Syracuse–San Diego State game. Syracuse won the game 80–64 with an attendance total of 26,752. The previous record of 23,522 was set by Kentucky in 1979.

On October 27, 2023, the NCAA announced that conference regular season champions that do not win their conference tournaments and are not otherwise not selected for the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament would no longer receive an automatic bid. The NIT would now guarantee bids to two teams from each of six major conferences: ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC. Regardless of their record, the top two teams from each conference in the NET Rankings that were not selected for the NCAA tournament would be invited to the NIT and guaranteed the option to host a first round game. After those twelve teams had been confirmed, the NIT selection committee would invite the twenty best available remaining teams, regardless of conference. Based on the selection committee&#x27;s rankings, four of those twenty &quot;at-large&quot; teams would be selected to host the remaining first round games. The change received criticism from mid-major schools, which would no longer have a fallback option should they win their regular season title but lose their conference tournament. The NCAA called the changes &quot;a preemptive attempt to keep the NIT viable long-term,&quot; citing competition from Fox Sports&#x27;s College Basketball Crown, then a prospective NIT competitor.

Ahead of the 2025 NIT, the NCAA again revised the selection criteria, removing some guarantees from power conferences and reinstating some of the previous automatic bid system. For the 2025 NIT, exempt bids will be given to two teams from both the ACC and SEC, plus one team each from the top twelve conferences as rated by KenPom. Additionally, automatic bids will be given to regular-season conference champions with an average ranking of 125 or better across the BPI, KPI, NET, KenPom, SOR, Torvik and WAB rankings.

If the top two non-NCAA tournament teams from each of the Big 12, Big East and Big Ten are all committed to play in the CBC, and those three conferences all rank in the top 12 conferences (other than the ACC and SEC), the NIT would be unable to get a team better than the third best non-NCAA tournament team from each of those three leagues. Since the CBC has 10 at-large bids, it may extend some of those to ACC and SEC teams, which could further dilute the quality of teams participating in the NIT, if those teams accept a CBC bid.

==Women&#x27;s tournaments==
From 1969 to 1996, a National Women&#x27;s Invitational Tournament (NWIT) existed; the tournament was resurrected under the same name in 1998, and has been known as the Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) since 1999. The original NWIT was an eight-team tournament held in Amarillo, Texas throughout its history. The revived tournament began with 16 teams, expanded to 32 in its second season, and has since expanded further to 40, 48, and finally 64 teams from 2010 to 2023. However, the WNIT is affiliated with the NIT in name only. Neither the NWIT nor WNIT was connected with MIBA, and the WNIT was not purchased by the NCAA; it is currently being run and operated by Triple Crown Sports.

In July 2023, the NCAA announced it would create a direct counterpart to the postseason WNIT, the Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitation Tournament (WBIT), with the first edition held in 2024. Like the men&#x27;s NIT, it features 32 teams and is directly run by the NCAA. The WBIT follows the pre-2024 NIT practice of extending invitations to all regular-season champions of Division I conferences that were not selected for the NCAA tournament (if eligible). Also, all games before the semifinals are at campus sites, with the semifinals and final at a neutral site. The announcement of the WBIT led Triple Crown Sports to reduce future WNIT fields to 48, effective with the 2024 edition.

==Men&#x27;s postseason NIT champions==


==Broadcasters==
CBS televised the NIT from 1966 to 1975. The competition switched to ESPN in 1989.

ESPN Radio aired the NIT from 2011 to 2020. Dial Global (later rebranded Westwood One) took over radio broadcasts in 2012.

<doc id="548898" wikidata="Q224606" url="?curid=548898" title="Culture of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>The culture of the Ottoman Empire evolved over several centuries as the ruling administration of the Turks absorbed, adapted and modified the various native cultures of conquered lands and their peoples. There was influence from the customs and languages of nearby Islamic societies such as Jordan, Egypt and Palestine, while Persian culture had a significant contribution through the Seljuq Turks, the Ottomans&#x27; predecessors. Despite more recent amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the Sultanate of Rum and the Seljuk Empire were influenced by Persian culture, language, habits, customs and cuisines.Throughout its history, the Ottoman Empire had substantial subject populations of Orthodox subjects, Armenians, Jews and Assyrians, who were allowed a certain amount of autonomy under the &quot;millet&quot; system of the Ottoman government, and whose distinctive cultures were adopted and adapted by the Ottoman state.

As the Ottoman Empire expanded it assimilated the culture of numerous regions under its rule and beyond, being particularly influenced by Turkic, Greco-Roman, Arabic, and Persian culture.

== Literature ==
=== Poetry ===
As with many Ottoman Turkish art forms, the poetry produced for the Ottoman court circle had a strong influence from classical Persian traditions; a large number of Persian loanwords entered the literary language, and Persian metres and forms (such as those of &quot;Ghazal&quot;) were used.

By the 19th century and the era of Tanzimat reforms, the influence of Turkish folk literature, until then largely oral, began to appear in Turkish poetry, and there was increasing influence from the literature of Europe; there was a corresponding decline in classical court poetry. Tevfik Fikret, born in 1867, is often considered the founder of modern Turkish poetry. Recaizade Mahmud Ekrem, an Ottoman writer and intellectual had also started his early career by writing poems in the newspaper of İbrahim Şinasi, Tasvir-i Efkar. Later in his career he helped a literary movement in the Empire – Servet-i Fünun, to emerge. Recaizade Mahmud Ekrem, had published poems like, Ah Nijad!, Şevki Yok and Güzelim.

=== Folk literature ===
Poet-musicians (ozan), were travelling around the Central Asia since the 9th century by telling epics, stories, and performing religious acts with their kopuz This tradition lived in Anatolia in the time of the Seljuk and the Ottoman Empire but with an Islamic intervention. The name aşık was adopted starting from the 14th and 15th centuries, it was an equivalent of the name ozan. Aşıks were the poets with an instrument called bağlama (saz), they were travelling around Anatolia and telling epics from old Turkic tradition with Islamic influence.&quot;

=== Prose ===

Prior to the 19th century, Ottoman prose was exclusively non-fictional, and was much less highly developed than Ottoman poetry, in part because much of it followed the rules of the originally Arabic tradition of rhymed prose (Saj&#x27;). Nevertheless, a number of genres – the travelogue, the political treatise and biography – were current.

From the 19th century, the increasing influence of the European novel, and particularly that of the French novel, began to be felt. Şemsettin Sami&#x27;s &quot;Taaşuk-u Tal&#x27;at ve Fitnat&quot;, widely considered the first Turkish novel, was published in 1872; other notable Ottoman writers of prose were Ahmet Mithat and Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil.

== Architecture ==
Ottoman architecture was largely a synthesis of Seljuk and Byzantine traditions, . It reached its greatest development in large public buildings, such as mosques and caravanserais, of the 16th century.

The most significant figure in the field, the 16th-century architect and engineer Mimar Sinan, was a Muslim convert, having a background in the Janissaries. His most famous works were the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne and the Suleiman Mosque in Constantinople. One of his pupils, Sedefkar Mehmed Agha, designed the early 17th century Blue Mosque, considered the last great building of classical Ottoman architecture.

== Decorative arts ==

=== Calligraphy ===
Calligraphy had a prestigious status under the Ottomans, its traditions having been shaped by the work of Abbasid calligrapher Yaqut al-Musta&#x27;simi of Baghdad, whose influence had spread across the Islamic world, al-Musta&#x27;simi himself possibly being of Anatolian origin.

The Diwani script is a cursive and distinctively Ottoman style of Arabic calligraphy developed in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by Housam Roumi, reaching its greatest development under Süleyman I the Magnificent (1520–66). The highly decorative script was distinguished by its complexity of line and by the close juxtaposition of the letters within words. Other forms included the flowing, rounded Nashki script, invented by the tenth-century Abbasid calligrapher Ali Muhammad ibn Muqlah, and Ta&#x27;liq, based on the Persian Nastalīq style.

Noted Ottoman calligraphers include Seyyid Kasim Gubari, Şeyh Hamdullah, Ahmed Karahisari, and Hâfiz Osman.

=== Miniatures ===
The Ottoman tradition of painting miniatures, to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the Persian art form, though it also included elements of the Byzantine tradition of illumination and painting. A Greek academy of painters, the &quot;Nakkashane-i-Rum&quot; was established in the Topkapi Palace in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the &quot;Nakkashane-i-Irani&quot;, was added.

We can establish approximatively the reign of Mehmed II (1451–81) as a moment of `birth´ of the production of the Ottoman miniatures with the first pieces having been found coming from this era. During that era many manuscripts show a desire in the court to establish a painting studio in the recently annexed capital of the empire Istanbul. This project seems to have succeeded in the 1480s, while we have clear proof of its existence and of the opening of new studios in other cities around 1825.

=== Carpet-weaving and textile arts ===
The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one&#x27;s shoes in living quarters. The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and patterned kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.

Hereke carpets were of particularly high status, being made of silk or a combination of silk and cotton, and intricately knotted. Other significant designs included &quot;Palace&quot;, &quot;Yörük&quot;, Ushak, and Milas or &quot;Türkmen&quot; carpets. &quot;Yörük&quot; and &quot;Türkmen&quot; represented more stylized designs, whereas naturalistic designs were prevalent in &quot;Palace&quot;.

=== Jewelry ===
The Ottoman Empire was noted for the quality of its gold- and silversmiths, and particularly for the jewelry they produced. Jewelry had particular importance as it was commonly given at weddings, as a gift that could be used as a form of savings. Silver was the most common material used, with gold reserved for more high-status pieces; designs often displayed complex filigree work and incorporated Persian and Byzantine motifs. Developments in design reflected the tastes of the Ottoman court, with Persian Safavid art, for example, becoming an influence after the Ottoman defeat of Ismail I after the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. In the rural areas of the Empire, jewelry was simpler and often incorporated gold coins (the Ottoman &quot;altin&quot;), but the designs of Constantinople nevertheless spread throughout Ottoman territory and were reflected even in the metalwork of Egypt and North Africa.
Most jewelers and goldsmiths were Christian Armenians and Jews, but the interest of the Ottomans in the related art of watchmaking resulted in many European goldsmiths, watchmakers and gem engravers moving to Constantinople, where they worked in the foreigners&#x27; quarter, Galata.

== Performance ==
=== Music ===
Apart from the music traditions of its constituent peoples, the Ottoman Empire evolved a distinct style of court music, Ottoman classical music. This was a principally vocal form, with instrumental accompaniment, built on &quot;makamlar&quot;, a set of melodic systems, with a corresponding set of rhythmic patterns called &quot;usul&quot;.

Another distinctive feature of Ottoman music were the &quot;mehterân&quot;, the military bands used by the Janissaries and in the retinues of high-ranking officials. These bands were the ancestors of the modern Ottoman military bands, as well as of the brass ensembles popular in traditional Balkan music.

=== Dance ===
Dancing was an important element of Ottoman culture, which incorporated the folkloric dancing traditions of many different countries and lands on three continents; from the Balkan peninsula and the Black Sea regions to the Caucasus, the Middle East and North Africa.

Dancing was also one of the most popular pastimes in the Imperial Harem of Topkapı Palace.

The female belly dancers, named &quot;Çengi&quot;, were mostly from the Roma community. Today, living in Istanbul&#x27;s Roma neighbourhoods like Sulukule, Kuştepe, Cennet and Kasımpaşa, they still dominate the traditional belly dancing and musical entertainment shows throughout the city&#x27;s traditional taverns.

There were also male dancers, named &quot;Köçek&quot;, who took part in the entertainment shows and celebrations, accompanied by circus acrobats, named &quot;Cambaz&quot;, performing difficult tricks, and other shows which attracted curiosity.

=== Meddah ===

The &quot;meddah&quot; or story teller played in front of a small group of viewers, such as a coffeehouse audience. The play was generally about a single topic, the &quot;meddah&quot; playing different characters, and was usually introduced by drawing attention to the moral contained in the story. The &quot;meddah&quot; would use props such as an umbrella, a handkerchief, or different headwear, to signal a change of character, and was skilled at manipulating his voice and imitating different dialects. There was no time limitation on the shows; a good &quot;meddah&quot; had the skill to adjust the story depending on interaction with the audience.

&quot;Meddah&quot;s were generally traveling artists whose route took them from one large city to another, such along the towns of the spice road; the tradition supposedly goes back to Homer&#x27;s time. The methods of &quot;meddah&quot;s were the same as the methods of the itinerant storytellers who related Greek epics such as the Iliad and Odyssey, even though the main stories were now Ferhat ile Şirin or Layla and Majnun. The repertoires of the &quot;meddah&quot;s also included true stories, modified depending on the audience, artist and political situation.

The Istanbul &quot;meddah&quot;s were known to integrate musical instruments into their stories: this was a main difference between them and the East Anatolian Dengbejin.

In 2008 the art of the &quot;meddah&quot;s was relisted in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

=== Karagöz shadow play ===

The Turkish shadow theatre, also known as Karagöz (&quot;Black-Eyed&quot;) after one of its main characters, is descended from the Oriental Shadow theatre. Today, scholars generally consider the technique of a single puppeteer creating voices for a dialogue, narrating a story, and possibly even singing, all while manipulating puppets, to be an Indonesian invention. According to Georg Jacob the certain date of Karagöz and Hacivat shadow play is unknown. However, the shadow play itself was invented in China and then transferred into Turkish tradition with the contribution of Mongols. The other theory is that the tradition of shadow play was introduced to Ottoman Empire from Egypt. And it is known that Egypt got this tradition from the Island of Java with the interaction through Arab merchants starting from 7th to 10th centuries.

==== Sections of play and characters ====
Karagöz shadow play (gölge oyunu) consists of four parts: Giriş (Introduction); Muhavere (Conversation); Fasıl; Bitiş (Ending).

In Introduction part, Hacivat enters the stage with the sound of Nareke – a tool that sounds like a buzzing of a bee, and starts reading poems which is an invitation for Karagöz to come to the stage.

In terms of characters, Karagöz and Hacivat was a reflection of Ottoman society. The cosmopolite structure of the Empire – especially of Istanbul, was shown to the audience. Here is the list of some characters of the shadow play:

* Main Characters: Karagöz and Hacivat
* Women: Zenne
* Characters from Istanbul: Çelebi, Tiryaki, Beberuhi and Matiz
* Provincial Characters: Laz, Kürd, Kayserili, Kastamonulu, Eğinli
* Muslim Characters outside of Anatolia: Muhacir (Turkish Balkan immigrant), Arab, Fars, Arnavut (Albanian)
* Non-Muslim Characters: Rum (Greek), Frank (European), Ermeni (Armenian), Yahudi (Jew)
* Bullies and Drunks: Efe, Zeybek, Matiz, Külhanbeyi, Sarhoş (Drunk)
* Characters who has mental or physical setbacks: Hımhım, the Stutterer, the Madman, the Cannabis addict, Denyo
* Entertainers: Male Köçek Dancer, Female Çengi Dancer, Singer, Magician, Acrobat, Musician, Illusionist, Reveller
* Supernatural Characters: Wizard, Cadılar (Witches), Djins and Demons,

=== Orta Oyunu or Medyan ===
The Orta Oyunu is an open stage theatric play that consists of two main characters &quot;Kavuklu&quot; and &quot;Pişekar&quot;. The play is based on discourse, two main characters of Orta Oyunu tell jokes from one to another to create an environment of humour, similar to Karagöz and Hacivat. However, Medyan&#x27;s way of playing is more flexible compared to Karagöz and Hacivat.

The first mention of the name Orta Oyunu is in 1834 in the wedding ceremony inscription of Saliha Sultan in those lines of poetry:

Medyan took its final form in the start of the 19th century. Seljuk plays that are based on performing imitation and personification were common. However, with the combination of raks (dance), musiki (music), muhavere (discourse), and histrionics the play of Orta Oyunu took its final shape. Other influential plays such as Karagöz and Hacivat, Kukla (puppet play), dans (dance), meddah (encomiastics) and prestidigitation were also significant in the shaping of Medyan, it is because those plays were also based on personification.

The forming elements of Orta Oyunu are the music, different forms of dances and wizardries of the different regions within the Ottoman Empire. Alongside these, cultural way of mocking, mimicking and discourses also have a part to play in Orta Oyunu.

==== Stage and characters ====
The play took place in an open area where people gathered around the field. Orta Oyunu is unique as it lacks a specific plot, emphasizing improvisation. Music, particularly folk songs and poems, plays a significant role in the performance. Alongside Kavuklu and Pişekar, there are supporting characters such as Curcunabazlar, Çengiler (women dancers), and Köçekler (young men dancers imitating women dancers). Other characters represented various stereotypes from different Ottoman millets, including Arabs, Armenians, Albanians, Kurds, Laz people, and Jews. The performance area was known as the &quot;Meydan&quot; (Square), and there was another space called the &quot;Yeni Dünya&quot; (New World) where men and women audience members observed the play. The men&#x27;s section was referred to as &quot;mevki&quot; (position), while the women&#x27;s section was called the &quot;kafes&quot; (cage). İsmail Dümbüllü, who passed away in 1973, was the last notable figure associated with Orta Oyunu.

== Sports ==
The Tanzimat period was particularly important in terms of the development of sports and gymnastics in the Ottoman Empire. As other fields like education, the influence of France is the most visible one. It is known that in Mekteb-i Harbiye (Staff Officer Academy), activities of gymnastics were added on the curriculum in 1863 which makes it the first mandatory modern sports lesson of the Empire – Riyazat-ı Bedeniye.

Other schools like Mekteb-i Sultani (Galatasaray Lisesi – Galatasaray High School) and Robert College were the pioneers of the Ottoman Empire in gymnastics. Galatasaray High School was the school of Faik Üstünidman who will later be known as &quot;Şeyhü’l-İdman&quot; because of his leadership in educating gymnastics students. Selim Sırrı Tarcan was also one of the pioneers of sports of the Ottoman Empire, he was the first person who put forward the ideal of competing in the olympic games.

Sultan Abdülaziz after his visits to Europe, ordered the translation of gymnastics books which will be used as school books in the Ottoman Empire. In 1869 Rüştiyeler (Junior High Schools), in 1870 Mekteb-i Tıbbiye (Ottoman Medical School), in 1887 İdadiler (High Schools) were now having gymnastics and fencing classes in their syllabuses.

Sports clubs

The Jewish Gymnastics Club of Constantinople, founded in 1895, was the first of Istanbul&#x27;s sports clubs, soon followed by Kurtuluş Sports Club founded in 1896 by Ottoman Greeks. The opening of these athletic clubs symbolized a general growth in sports and sports culture in Istanbul at the time. In the coming years, Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club, the Galatasaray Sports Club, and the Fenerbahçe Sports Club — Istanbul&#x27;s &quot;big three&quot; — were founded. Exercise, as well as football and gymnastics were commonplace among the primarily affluent members of these clubs. In contrast to the fairly exclusive &quot;big three&quot;, Vefa Sports Club, established after the progressive Young Turk revolution in 1908, served as an amateur sports and football club of the people.
 The turn of the twentieth century saw clubs spring up throughout Istanbul to appeal to many niches of young men, whether Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. Almost all athletic clubs were ethnically and religiously homogeneous, however they all shared a focus on physicality. Furthermore, the function of these institutions expanded beyond sports, as they taught young men proper hygiene, dress, and posture, in addition to serving as environments for male discourse and socializing.

 The development of athletic clubs enabled the rise of team sports in Istanbul — principally football — serving as contrasts to the more traditional Ottoman sports of oil wrestling and archery. For instance, upon its opening in 1905, Galatasaray functioned exclusively as a football club. This shift toward team competition represented a general modernization of sports in Istanbul, a modernization that can also be seen, for example, in the Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club as traditional Turkish wrestling embraced new mat technology.

 Athletic clubs revolutionized sports reporting in the Ottoman Empire, as publications began to cover club games. &quot;Futbol&quot;, written in Ottoman Turkish and initially released in 1910, served as Istanbul&#x27;s first sports magazine, principally following club football matches.

Growth in sports related readership coincided with a growing sports spectating culture in Istanbul. 1905 saw the creation of the Constantinople Association Football League, which organized soccer matches among athletic clubs, while also providing entertainment for thousands of spectators. Completed in 1909, with the blessing of Sultan Abdülhamid II, the Union Club provided the first reliable stadium in which thousands of Istanbul spectators could gather to watch sports. Contrary to the strict homosocial exclusivity of many clubs, the Union Club allowed women to spectate athletic competitions. With this rise in spectatorship, Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe in particular, became recognized as the city&#x27;s preeminent clubs. While heavily connected to football, the Union Club hosted a plethora events organized by a variety of Istanbul athletic clubs, including races, gymnastics, and more. For example, in 1911, the Union Club was the site of the first Armenian Olympics.

In the past century, many of these clubs have only continued to gain popularity. Now under the Republic of Turkey, the Süper Lig represents the region&#x27;s most popular football league, and Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe are the league&#x27;s most popular teams.

== Ottoman cuisine ==
The cuisine of Ottoman Turkey can be divided between that of the Ottoman court itself, which was a highly sophisticated and elaborate fusion of many of the culinary traditions found in the Empire, its predecessors (notably the Byzantine Empire), and the regional cuisines of the peasantry and of the Empire&#x27;s minorities, which were influenced by the produce of their respective areas. Rice, for example, was a staple of high-status cookery (Imperial cooks were hired according to the skill they displayed in cooking it) but would have been regarded as a luxury item through most of Anatolia, where bread was the staple grain food.

=== Drinks ===

* Turkish coffee – probably introduced from Levantine Arabic culture, coffee became central to Ottoman society – often accompanied with a Nargile (Narguile / Hookah).
* Ayran – a traditional yogurt drink still popular throughout many areas of the former Empire.
* Sherbet – a spiced cold fruit drink.
* Rakı – a traditional Turkish alcoholic beverage.

=== Food ===
* Lokum (Turkish delight)
* Şeker (Candies)
** Akide Şekeri
* Macun
* Pestil
* Sucuk
* Shish Kebab
* Çörek
* Baklava
* Lahmacun
* Döner
* Kebab

<doc id="548901" wikidata="Q685223" url="?curid=548901" title="Gilles Peterson">
<text>Gilles Jérôme Moehrle MBE (; born 28 September 1964), better known as Gilles Peterson (), is a broadcaster, DJ, record label and festival owner. He is renowned for his genre-defying approach to music with jazz at its core. From this base he has systematically championed a whole range of music from across the globe moving from dance music to experimental and all points in-between.

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
Peterson was first heard as a DJ on London pirate station Radio Invicta. He spent his teenage years putting up radio transmitters for the pirates and playing on stations such as Horizon, K-Jazz and Starpoint. Brought up in the suburban South London soul scene, Peterson was exposed to a variety of music which shaped his future musical taste and broadcasting style.

He hosted &quot;Mad on Jazz&quot; on BBC Radio London in 1986–87, and became known on the London circuit as a DJ specialising in the new breed of &quot;acid jazz&quot;, drawing on the jazz, funk, Latin fusions and Brazilian music of the 1970s.

In March 1990, Peterson joined London&#x27;s first-ever dedicated jazz station 102.2 Jazz FM at its launch. He was dismissed from the station after playing anti-war songs and making anti-war comments during the first Gulf War.

Peterson then joined Kiss FM in 1991, the station having become legal the year before, where he remained until 1998 when he joined BBC Radio 1 with his Worldwide show, in which he presented a wide range of music helping audiences join the dots between different genres.

In late 2011, Peterson announced that, after 13 years at the station, he would be leaving Radio 1, following his last show in the early hours of 28 March and moving to a new show on BBC Radio 6 Music. Peterson started his new three-hour Saturday afternoon show on 7 April 2012, which continues to this day. 

In 2013, Peterson launched Worldwide FM as an in-game radio station on &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; . In 2016 it became a new global music-radio platform named Worldwide FM. From its inception until 2022, the station was powered by WeTransfer and broadcast from The Pyramid radio studios in north London. From the autumn of 2022, the station continued with Peterson&#x27;s regular Thursday morning shows augmented by guest slots and takeovers along the way.

=== DJ ===
From his early teens, Peterson played at local South London wine bars and clubs as part of the burgeoning jazz funk scene. He then started playing back rooms and weekenders across London and the South East gaining inspiration from Manchester&#x27;s legendary Berlin club, among others. These steps led to him becoming part of different scenes including upstairs at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, the WAG Club in Soho and Special Branch in London Bridge while putting on his own events in partnership with other DJs such as Chris Bangs.

Of these regular sessions, some of the most influential were the Sunday afternoon residency at Dingwalls in Camden which runs to this day, the Monday night &#x27;That&#x27;s How It Is&#x27; sessions at Bar Rumba as well as Babylon at Heaven, Fez, Talkin Loud at the Fridge and his long association with Plastic People.

In addition to his UK activities, Peterson began playing regularly in Europe with seminal residencies at Soul Seduction in Vienna and Beat Box in Wuppertal as well as regular visits to Japan, Australia and America.

From these foundations, Peterson has built a worldwide following for his unique take on club culture and the dance floor in which disparate genres can live next to each other with ease.

=== Record labels ===
Peterson&#x27;s first foray into the label world was with Hardback Records and then BGP. After these formative experiences, in 1988 he started Acid Jazz quickly moving on to his Talkin&#x27; Loud imprint backed by Phonogram.

The label saw five of its artists nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, with Roni Size&#x27;s Reprazent winning the award in 1997 for the album &quot;New Forms&quot;.[10] 

Peterson&#x27;s current record label, Brownswood Recordings, was launched in 2006. The label has received a Mercury nomination for Ghostpoet&#x27;s debut album, a BRIT nomination for Yussef Dayes&#x27; Black Classical Music which also one an Ivor Novello. The label is also known for its long running compilation series, compiled by Peterson, called Brownswood Bubblers and emerging talent series Future Bubblers. 

As part of Brownswood, the Arc Recordings imprint is specialised in reissues.

In 2006, Peterson worked with Freshly Cut, a French event production company from Montpellier, to create the Worldwide Festival, a small intimate festival during the summertime in the coastal town of Sète in France. It celebrated its nineteenth edition in 2024. 

In 2018, in partnership with Ed Wilson of Brawn and Mercati Generali - Peterson launched the Ricci Weekender in Catania, Sicily bringing together a unique mixture of music, DJs, food and wine which celebrated its 6th edition in 2024.

In 2019, Peterson helped found a new festival We Out Here with New Bohemia. Originally taking place in Cambridgeshire, the festival celebrates the &#x27;elements and community of UK club culture and live music&#x27;. In 2023 the festival moved to a new site in Wimborne St Giles, Dorset where it continues to reside having celebrated its 5th edition in 2024.

In 2024, Peterson launched Impressions in partnership with the Fondation Maeght in St. Paul-De-Vence walking in the footsteps of Albert Ayler and Sun Ra featuring spiritual music played in the Miro sculpture garden.

Hearn was a candidate in the 1989 Progressive Conservative Leadership Convention to replace outgoing Premier Brian Peckford, the eventual winner was Tom Rideout.

Hearn went on to enter federal politics and was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of St. John&#x27;s West from 2000 to 2003 and St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl from 2003 to 2008. He was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from 2000 to 2004, and was active in representing the party during its merger discussions with the Canadian Alliance. Those discussions culminated in the merger of the two parties in December 2003, to the Conservative Party of Canada. Hearn served as the first House Leader of the newly created party until it had its first leadership convention.

He has served (either before or after the merger) as the Progressive Conservative Party House Leader, Conservative Party House Leader, Opposition House Leader, Canadian Heritage Critic, Public Works and Government Services Critic, and Critic of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.

Following his victory in the 2006 federal election he was named Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on February 6, 2006. As Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Hearn has been active in defending the controversial east coast seal hunt. In this role, he claimed that several observers from the Humane Society of the United States had been arrested for illegal activity during their campaign against the seal hunt, but was later forced to apologize under threat of a libel suit, as no arrests had in fact taken place.

Hearn has also had to deal with the crises in several rural Newfoundland communities involving the sale of fish plants by Fishery Products International to Ocean Choice, often being in conflict with the provincial government, business and unions.

A few days prior to the dissolution of Parliament in September 2008, Hearn announced that he would not stand for re-election in the 2008 election.

==Ambassador to Ireland==
On November 19, 2010, Lawrence Cannon, Canada&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced the appointment of Hearn as Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to Ireland, succeeding Pat Binns. Hearn&#x27;s term as ambassador ended on January 19, 2015 and was replaced by Kevin Vickers.

In 2018, Hearn endorsed Ches Crosbie in the 2018 provincial PC leadership race.

Hearn endorsed Peter Mackay in the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election.

==Personal life==
Hearn has a son, David (January 1979), and a daughter, Laurita (February 1976), with his wife, Maureen Hearn.

<text>Vladivoj ( – January 1003) was Duke of Bohemia from 1002 until his death.

== Life ==
He was probably a member of the Piast dynasty, maybe the second son of Doubravka, daughter of Duke Boleslaus I of Bohemia, and her husband Duke Mieszko I of Poland, or a distant relative. When Duke Boleslaus III was dethroned during a revolt by the Czech Vršovci clan, the Bohemian nobles declared Vladivoj, who had earlier fled to Poland, duke in 1002. The Czech historian Dušan Třeštík writes that Vladivoj assumed the Bohemian throne with the support of the Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave. In November, he also obtained the support by the German king Henry II who enfeoffed him with the Bohemian duchy.

After Vladivoj died in 1003, Bolesław the Brave invaded Bohemia and restored Boleslaus III who had many Bohemian noblemen murdered. It is said that Vladivoj was an alcoholic, and drinking was a possible contributor to his death. A massacre of the Vršovci clan at Vyšehrad ordered by Boleslaus III led to his deposition and the succession of his younger brother Jaromír.

<doc id="548913" wikidata="Q2507454" url="?curid=548913" title="Adrenal insufficiency">
<text>Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. The adrenal glands—also referred to as the adrenal cortex—normally secrete glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone), and androgens. These hormones are important in regulating blood pressure, electrolytes, and metabolism as a whole. Deficiency of these hormones leads to symptoms ranging from abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle weakness and fatigue, low blood pressure, depression, mood and personality changes (in mild cases) to organ failure and shock (in severe cases). Adrenal crisis may occur if a person having adrenal insufficiency experiences stresses, such as an accident, injury, surgery, or severe infection; this is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from severe deficiency of cortisol in the body. Death may quickly follow.

Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by dysfunction of the adrenal gland itself, whether by destruction (e.g. Addison&#x27;s disease), failure of development (e.g. adrenal dysgenesis), or enzyme deficiency (e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Adrenal insufficiency can also occur when the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus do not produce adequate amounts of the hormones that assist in regulating adrenal function. This is called secondary adrenal insufficiency (when caused by lack of production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the pituitary gland) or tertiary adrenal insufficiency (when caused by lack of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus).

==Types==
There are three major types of adrenal insufficiency, depending on the affected organ.

* Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to impairment of the adrenal glands, resulting in a lack of glucocorticoid production. Since the adrenal glands are directly affected, mineralocorticoid production is also reduced. Principal causes include:
** Autoimmune: e.g. Addison&#x27;s disease (also called autoimmune adrenalitis), which has been identified to be the cause of 80–90% of primary adrenal insufficiency cases since 1950.
** Congenital: e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenoleukodystrophy
** Infection: e.g. tuberculosis, CMV, histoplasmosis
** Drugs: e.g. anticonvulsants, etomidate, metyrapone, rifampicin
** Vascular: e.g. hemorrhage from sepsis, adrenal vein thrombosis, hypercoagulable states such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid syndrome
** Neoplasia: e.g. adenoma (tumor) of the adrenal gland
** Deposition disease: e.g. hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis
** Idiopathic: undetermined cause
** Acquired: Bilateral Adrenalectomy to treat recurrent Cushing&#x27;s Disease/Syndrome
* Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by impairment of the pituitary gland, resulting in a lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production and subsequent decreased adrenal stimulation. Since the adrenal glands are not directly affected, the effect on mineralocorticoid production is minimal, as ACTH primarily affects glucocorticoid production. Principal causes include:
** Pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma: Tumors in the pituitary gland can suppress production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). High-dose irradiation (&gt;30 Gy) to the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland can cause ACTH deficiency.
** Surgery or radiation: Pituitary gland surgery and/or radiation can lead to destruction of ACTH-producing tissue.
** Exogenous corticosteroid use: Exogenous corticosteroids suppress the stimulation of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to secrete CRH and ACTH, respectively. These cases may present with symptoms of cortisol excess (see Cushing&#x27;s syndrome).
** Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome: Loss of blood flow to the pituitary gland following childbirth
** Pituitary apoplexy: Bleeding or impaired blood supply to the pituitary gland
* Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is caused by impairment of the hypothalamus, resulting in a lack of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production, causing downstream reduction in ACTH production and subsequently decreasing adrenal stimulation. Since the adrenal glands are not directly affected, the effect on mineralocorticoid production is minimal, as ACTH primarily affects glucocorticoid production. Principal causes include:
** Sudden withdrawal from long-term exogenous steroid use
** Brain tumors

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms include: hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, dehydration, weight loss, and disorientation. Additional signs and symptoms include weakness, tiredness, dizziness, low blood pressure that falls further when standing (orthostatic hypotension), cardiovascular collapse, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These problems may develop gradually and insidiously. Addison&#x27;s disease can present with tanning of the skin that may be patchy or even all over the body. Characteristic sites of tanning are skin creases (e.g. of the hands) and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa). Goitre and vitiligo may also be present. Eosinophilia may also occur. Hyponatremia is a sign of secondary insufficiency.

==Pathophysiology==

When functioning normally, the adrenal glands secrete glucocorticoids (primarily, cortisol) in the &quot;zona fasciculata&quot; and mineralocorticoids (primarily, aldosterone) in the &quot;zona glomerulosa&quot; to regulate metabolism, blood pressure, and electrolyte balance. Adrenal hormone production is controlled by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in which the hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. High levels of cortisol inhibit the production of both CRH and ACTH, forming a negative feedback loop. The types of adrenal insufficiency thus refer to the level of the axis in which the dysfunction originates: primary, secondary, and tertiary for adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus, respectively.

In adrenal insufficiency, there is a deficiency in cortisol production which may be accompanied by a deficiency in aldosterone production (predominantly in primary adrenal insufficiency). Depending on the cause and type of adrenal insufficiency, the mechanism of the disease differs. Generally, the symptoms manifest through the systemic effects of cortisol and aldosterone. In secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, there is no effect on the production of aldosterone within the &quot;zona glomerulosa&quot; as this process is regulated by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), not ACTH.

Adrenal insufficiency can also affect the &quot;zona reticularis&quot; and disrupt production of androgens, which are precursors to testosterone and estrogen. This leads to a deficiency of sex hormones and can contribute to symptoms of depression and menstrual irregularities.

=== Cortisol deficiency ===
Cortisol increases blood sugar by inducing gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the liver, lipolysis (fat breakdown) in adipose tissue, and proteolysis (muscle breakdown) in muscle while increasing glucagon secretion and decreasing insulin secretion in the pancreas. Overall, these actions cause the body to use fat stores and muscle for energy. Deficiency results in hypoglycemia, with associated nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness.

Cortisol potentiates the effectiveness of angiotensin II and catecholamines such as norepinephrine in vasoconstriction. Thus, a deficiency can contribute to hypotension, though this effect is most pronounced in mineralocorticoid deficiency.

In primary adrenal insufficiency, the lack of negative feedback from cortisol leads to increased production of CRH and ACTH. ACTH is derived from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is cleaved into ACTH as well as α-MSH, which regulates production of melanin in the skin. The overproduction of α-MSH leads to the characteristic hyperpigmentation of Addison&#x27;s disease.

=== Aldosterone deficiency ===
Although the production of aldosterone occurs within the adrenal cortex, it is not induced by adrenocorticotropic (ACTH); instead, it is regulated by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). Renin production in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney is induced by decreased arterial blood pressure, decreased sodium content in the distal convoluted tubule, and increased sympathetic tone. Renin initiates the downstream sequence of cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I to angiotensin II, in which angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone production in the &quot;zona glomerulosa&quot;. Thus, dysfunction of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus does not affect the production of aldosterone. However, in primary adrenal insufficiency, damage to the adrenal cortex (e.g. autoimmune adrenalitis a.k.a. Addison&#x27;s disease) can lead to destruction of the &quot;zona glomerulosa&quot; and therefore a loss of aldosterone production.

Aldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors on epithelial cells lining the distal convoluted tubule, activating epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump. This results in the absorption of sodium (with resulting retention of fluid) and the excretion of potassium. Deficiency of aldosterone leads to urinary loss of sodium and effective circulating volume, as well as retention of potassium. This can cause hypotension (in severe cases, shock), dizziness (from orthostatic hypotension), dehydration, and salt craving.

Differently from mineralocorticoid deficiency, glucocorticoid deficiency does not cause a negative sodium balance (in fact a positive sodium balance may occur).

== Causes ==
Causes of acute adrenal insufficiency are mainly sudden withdrawal of long-term corticosteroid therapy, Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome, and stress in people with underlying chronic adrenal insufficiency. The latter is termed critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency.

For chronic adrenal insufficiency, the major contributors are autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison&#x27;s Disease), tuberculosis, AIDS, and metastatic disease. Minor causes of chronic adrenal insufficiency are systemic amyloidosis, fungal infections, hemochromatosis, and sarcoidosis.

Causes of adrenal insufficiency can be categorized by the mechanism through which they cause the adrenal glands to produce insufficient cortisol. These are adrenal destruction (disease processes leading to glandular damage), impaired steroidogenesis (the gland is present but is biochemically unable to produce cortisol), or adrenal dysgenesis (the gland has not formed adequately during development).

===Adrenal destruction===
Autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison&#x27;s disease) is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in the industrialised world, causing 80–90% of cases since 1950. Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex is caused by an immune reaction against the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (a phenomenon first described in 1992). This may be isolated or in the context of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS type 1 or 2), in which other hormone-producing organs, such as the thyroid and pancreas, may also be affected.

Autoimmune adrenalitis may be part of type 2 autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, which can include type 1 diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid disease (also known as autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, and Hashimoto&#x27;s disease). Hypogonadism may also present with this syndrome. Other diseases that are more common in people with autoimmune adrenalitis include premature ovarian failure, celiac disease, and autoimmune gastritis with pernicious anemia.

Adrenal destruction is a feature of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Destruction also occurs when the adrenal glands are involved in metastasis (seeding of cancer cells from elsewhere in the body, especially lung), hemorrhage (e.g. in Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome or antiphospholipid syndrome), particular infections which can spread to the adrenal cortex (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis), or the deposition of abnormal protein in amyloidosis.

===Impaired steroidogenesis===
To form cortisol, the adrenal gland requires cholesterol, which is then converted biochemically into steroid hormones. Interruptions in the delivery of cholesterol include Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome and abetalipoproteinemia.

Of the synthesis problems, congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most common (in various forms: 21-hydroxylase, 17α-hydroxylase, 11β-hydroxylase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), lipoid CAH due to deficiency of StAR and mitochondrial DNA mutations. Some medications interfere with steroid synthesis enzymes (e.g. ketoconazole), while others accelerate the normal breakdown of hormones by the liver (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin).

Adrenal insufficiency can also result when a patient has a brain mass in the pituitary gland (e.g. pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma) which can take up space and interfere with the secretion of pituitary hormones such as ACTH, therefore leading to decreased adrenal stimulation (secondary adrenal insufficiency). The same can occur with masses in the hypothalamus (tertiary adrenal insufficiency).

==== Corticosteroid withdrawal ====
Use of high-dose steroids for more than a week begins to produce suppression of the person&#x27;s adrenal glands because the exogenous glucocorticoids suppress release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid. During this recovery time, the person is vulnerable to adrenal insufficiency during times of stress, such as illness, due to both adrenal atrophy and suppression of CRH and ACTH release. Use of steroids joint injections may also result in adrenal suppression after discontinuation.

===Adrenal dysgenesis===
All causes in this category are genetic, and generally very rare. These include mutations to the &quot;SF1&quot; transcription factor, congenital adrenal hypoplasia due to &quot;DAX-1&quot; gene mutations and mutations to the ACTH receptor gene (or related genes, such as in the Triple A or Allgrove syndrome). &quot;DAX-1&quot; mutations may cluster in a syndrome with glycerol kinase deficiency with a number of other symptoms when &quot;DAX-1&quot; is deleted together with a number of other genes.

==Diagnosis==
The first step of diagnosing adrenal insufficiency is confirming inappropriately low cortisol secretion. This is followed by determining the origin of dysfunction (adrenal glands, pituitary gland, or hypothalamus) and therefore the type of adrenal insufficiency (primary, secondary, or tertiary). After narrowing down the source, further testing can elucidate the cause of insufficiency.

If a patient is suspected to be experiencing an acute adrenal crisis, immediate treatment with IV corticosteroids is imperative and should not be delayed for any testing, as the patient&#x27;s health can deteriorate rapidly and result in death without replacing the corticosteroids. Dexamethasone should be used as the corticosteroid of choice in these cases as it is the only corticosteroid that will not affect diagnostic test results.

To confirm inappropriately low cortisol secretion, testing can include baseline morning cortisol level in the blood or morning cortisol level in the saliva. Cortisol levels typically peak in the morning; thus, low values indicate true adrenal insufficiency. Urinary free cortisol can also be measured, but are not necessary for diagnosis.

To determine the origin of dysfunction, the ACTH stimulation test is the best initial test as it can differentiate between primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. If cortisol levels remain low following ACTH stimulation, then the diagnosis is primary adrenal insufficiency. If cortisol levels increase following ACTH stimulation, then the diagnosis is either secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. The corticotropin-releasing hormone test can then differentiate between secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Additional testing can include basal plasma ACTH, renin, and aldosterone concentrations, as well as a blood chemistry panel to check for electrolyte imbalances.

Depending on the type of adrenal insufficiency, there are many possible causes and therefore many different avenues of testing (see Causes above). For primary adrenal insufficiency, the most common cause is autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison&#x27;s disease); therefore, 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies should be checked. Structural abnormalities of the adrenal glands can be detected on CT imaging. For secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, an MRI of the brain can be obtained to detect structural abnormalities such as masses, metastasis, hemorrhage, infarction, or infection.

=== Effects ===


==Treatment==
In general, the treatment of adrenal insufficiency requires replacement of deficient hormones, as well as treatment of any underlying cause. All types of adrenal insufficiency will require glucocorticoid repletion. Many cases (typically, primary adrenal insufficiency) will also require mineralocorticoid repletion. In rarer cases, repletion of androgens may also be indicated, typically in female patients with mood disturbances and changes in well-being.

* Adrenal crisis (acute) treatment
** Intravenous fluids
** Intravenous glucocorticoids
*** typically hydrocortisone (Cortef) but dexamethasone (Decadron) may be used if diagnostic studies are necessary, as dexamethasone does not affect testing results
** Supportive measures and correction of any additional issues such as electrolyte abnormalities
* Chronic adrenal insufficiency treatment
** Glucocorticoid deficiency (low cortisol)
*** Oral glucocorticoids
**** Hydrocortisone (brand name: Cortef), or
**** Prednisone (brand name: Deltasone), or
**** Dexamethasone (brand name: Decadron)
** Mineralocorticoid deficiency (low aldosterone) treatment
*** Oral mineralocorticoids
**** Fludrocortisone (brand name: Florinef)
** Sex hormone deficiency (low androgen)
*** Oral androgens
**** Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

== Prognosis ==
Primary adrenal insufficiency predisposes to higher risk of death, mostly due to infection, cardiovascular disease, and adrenal crisis. Delayed diagnosis can impair quality of life, and lack of treatment brings high mortality. However, with proper diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, people with adrenal insufficiency can live normally.

== Epidemiology ==
The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison&#x27;s disease) overall is autoimmune adrenalitis. The prevalence of Addison&#x27;s disease ranges from 5 to 221 per million in different countries.

In children, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the most common cause of adrenal insufficiency, with an incidence 1 in 14,200 live births.
