<text>Aubonne () is a municipality in the district of Morges in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. In 2011 the former municipality of Pizy merged into Aubonne and on 1 January 2021 Montherod merged into it.

==History==
The municipality was settled very early. The oldest remains are from the Bronze Age. From Roman times, there remain foundations of villas, and from early medieval times, graves.

The first documentation of the municipality is from 1177 under the name of &quot;Albona&quot;. In the first half of the 13th century, a defensive wall was built around the town. In 1255, the town was sold to Count Peter II of Savoy. He gave the governing of the town over to the family of Thoire-Villars. Aubonne was the most important town on the north side of the lake between Lausanne and Geneva until the second half of the 15th century. Since the 13th century, it had weekly markets, and starting in 1487 semi-annual three-day markets.

The Count of Greyerz acquired Aubonne in 1393. Since he was allied with the &quot;Eidgenossen&quot;, the municipality was spared the ravages of the Burgundian Wars in 1476. When the canton of Vaud was conquered by Bern in 1536, Aubonne came under Bernese domination, but still belonged to the Count of Greyerz until 1553.

In 1670, the city was bought by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, and in 1685 by Henri Duquesne, who sold it to Bern again in 1701. From 1798 to 1803 it belonged to the canton of Léman in the Helvetic Republic, which, through the mediation of Napoleon became the canton of Vaud. Aubonne was the capital of its district from 1803 until 2006.

On 5 December 2017, Michael I of Romania died in his home in Aubonne.

<doc id="539738" wikidata="Q1247865" url="?curid=539738" title="The Bridge on the Drina">
<text>The Bridge on the Drina is a historical novel by the Yugoslav writer Ivo Andrić. It revolves around the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge in Višegrad, which spans the Drina River and stands as a silent witness to history from its construction by the Ottomans in the mid-16th century until its partial destruction during World War I. The story spans about four centuries and covers the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian occupations of the region, with a particular emphasis on the lives, destinies, and relations of the local inhabitants, especially Serbs and Bosnian Muslims.

Andrić had been Yugoslavia&#x27;s ambassador to Germany from 1939 to 1941, during the early years of World War II, and was arrested by the Germans in April 1941, following the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. In June 1941, he was allowed to return to German-occupied Belgrade but was confined to a friend&#x27;s apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. The novel was one of three that Andrić wrote over the next several years. All three were published in short succession in 1945, following Belgrade&#x27;s liberation from the Germans. &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; was published in March of that year to widespread acclaim.

In 1961, Andrić was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and his works became subject to international recognition, while at the same time, he expressed a desire for the original manuscript to be donated to the city of Sarajevo, where the Museum of Literature was established. &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; remains Andrić&#x27;s best-known work. The Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica is planning a cinematic adaption of the novel, for which he has constructed a mock-town named after Andrić not far from the bridge, which was reconstructed after World War I and has been declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina by KONS and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==Summary==

A young Serb boy from the vicinity of Višegrad is taken from his mother by the Ottomans as part of the &quot;devşirme&quot; levy, one of many Christian boys to experience this fate during the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy&#x27;s mother follows her son wailing until she reaches the Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. He rises through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted by the memory of being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.

Construction begins in 1566, and five years later the bridge is completed, together with a &quot;caravanserai&quot; (or &quot;han&quot;). The bridge replaces the unreliable ferry transport that was once the only means of traversing the river and comes to represent an important link between the Bosnia Eyalet and the rest of the Ottoman Empire. The bridge is built by serfs, who intermittently stage strikes and sabotage the construction site in protest against the poor working conditions. The Ottomans respond harshly, impaling the one caught saboteur. The bridge is wider across the middle portion, known as the gate (or &quot;kapija&quot;), and this section becomes a popular meeting place. Every important moment in the lives of the local residents comes to revolve around the bridge, with Christian children crossing it to be baptized on the opposite bank, and children of all religions playing around it. As time progresses, legends develop around the history of the bridge. The locals tell of two Christian infants who were buried alive inside the bridge to placate the fairies (&quot;vile&quot;) that thwart its construction. They come to regard two holes on the side of the bridge as places where the infants&#x27; mothers would come to suckle them while they were entombed. About a century later, the Habsburg monarchy reclaims much of Central Europe and the northern Balkans from the Ottomans, triggering a crisis within the empire. Due to lack of state funds, the &quot;caravanserai&quot; is abandoned and falls into disuse. The bridge, on the other hand, stands for centuries without maintenance because of how well it was constructed. The residents of Višegrad—Turks, Serbs, Sephardic Jews, and Roma—stand in solidarity with one another during the Drina&#x27;s regular floods.

The first nationalist tensions arise in the 19th century, with the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising in present-day central Serbia. The Turks construct a blockhouse on the bridge, decorating it with stakes on which they pin the heads of suspected rebels. One evening, the blockhouse burns down. In the ensuing decades, as the Ottoman Empire continues to decline, Bosnia is ravaged by plague. After the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia and Montenegro become fully independent countries. Austria-Hungary receives a right to occupy Bosnia-Herzegovina and turns it into a protectorate. The occupation comes as a shock to the residents of the town, which has remained largely unchanged since the time of the bridge&#x27;s completion, and the local people experience difficulties accepting the numerous changes and reforms that accompany Austro-Hungarian rule. A barrack is built at the site of the &quot;caravanserai&quot; and the town experiences a substantial influx of foreigners. People from all parts of Austria-Hungary arrive, opening new businesses and bringing the customs of their native regions with them. A narrow gauge railway line is built to Sarajevo and the bridge loses much of its strategic importance. Local children begin to be educated in Sarajevo, and some go on to continue their studies in Vienna. They bring home new social and cultural ideas from abroad, among them the concepts of trade unions and socialism, while newly established newspapers acquaint the town&#x27;s inhabitants with nationalism. Tensions flare following the assassination of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1898. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexes Bosnia-Herzegovina, sparking tensions with Serbia, which the Austro-Hungarians come to regard as a serious obstacle to their further conquest of the Balkans. The Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 see the Ottomans almost completely forced from the region, and relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia deteriorate further. The significance of the middle portion of the bridge also becomes undermined, as residents of different ethnicities become suspicious and wary of one another.

In June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinates Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, setting off a chain of events that lead to the outbreak of World War I. Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia, and the local authorities begin to incite Višegrad&#x27;s non-Serb population against the town&#x27;s Serb residents. The bridge with the old road to Sarajevo suddenly regains its importance, as the railway line is not adequate to transport all the materiel and soldiers who are preparing to attack Serbia in the autumn of 1914. Austria-Hungary&#x27;s invasion is swiftly repulsed and the Serbians advance across the Drina, prompting the Austro-Hungarians to evacuate Višegrad and destroy portions of the bridge.

==Writing and publication==

Ivo Andrić was Yugoslavia&#x27;s best known and most successful literary figure, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. He was born to Antun Andrić and Katarina Pejić near Travnik on 9 October 1892, but spent most of his childhood in the town of Višegrad. His formative years were spent in the shadow of the town&#x27;s most distinctive landmark, the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge. As a child, Andrić played in its vicinity and heard the legends surrounding it and its patron, Mehmed-paša Sokolović. Born into a Bosnian Serb family on the outskirts of the town, Sokolović had been abducted by the Ottomans as a child as part of the &quot;devşirme&quot; tax imposed on Christian subjects, taken to Istanbul and inducted into the janissary corps. Despite this, he remained in contact with his Christian family, and in 1557, convinced the Porte to grant the Serbian Orthodox Church autonomy.

Andrić&#x27;s literary career began in 1911, and prior to the outbreak of World War I, he published a number of poems, essays and reviews, and also translated the works of foreign writers. In the years leading up to the war, he joined a number of South Slav student movements calling for an end to the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was also a close friend of Princip. In late July or early August 1914, Andrić was arrested by the Austro-Hungarians for his connections to Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassins. He spent much of World War I in captivity, and was only freed in July 1917, after Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1920, Andrić entered the diplomatic service of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia) He published a short story titled &quot;The Bridge on the Žepa&quot;, which was to serve as a prototype for the &quot;Bridge on the Drina&quot;, in 1925. In 1939, he was appointed as Yugoslavia&#x27;s ambassador to Germany, which went on to spearhead an invasion of his country in April 1941, within the wider context of World War II. Andrić and his staff were arrested by the Germans following the invasion. In June 1941, he was permitted to return to Belgrade. Andrić was retired from the diplomatic service and confined to a friend&#x27;s apartment by the Germans, living in conditions that some biographers have likened to house arrest. Over the following three years, he focused on his writing and pondered over the disintegration of Yugoslavia, which had become the scene of a brutal inter-ethnic civil war following the invasion.

&quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; was written between July 1942 and December 1943. A fifty-page outline of the novel has been preserved, as have Andrić&#x27;s research notes. In March 1945, it became the first title released by the newly founded state-owned publishing house &quot;Prosveta&quot;, as part of a series entitled &quot;Južnoslovenski pisci&quot; (South Slav Writers). The first edition, numbering some 5,000 copies, was sold out by the end of that year. It was one of three novels that Andrić published in 1945, the others being &quot;Travnik Chronicle&quot; () and &quot;The Lady from Sarajevo&quot; (), in September and November 1945, respectively. A total of five editions of &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; were published over the next four years. Andrić&#x27;s works attained international recognition only after he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and were translated into dozens of languages thereafter. The novel had been translated into English two years earlier by Lovett F. Edwards, in 1959.

==Style==
The novel&#x27;s release coincided with the end of World War II, as well as Partisan efforts to promote the style of socialist realism, exemplified by depictions of &quot;superficial happiness&quot; glorifying the values of communism. In contrast, Slavonic studies professor David A. Norris writes, &quot;Andrić&#x27;s Bosnia is often a dark world expressed through deep and complex narrative structures&quot;. Andrić never publicly expressed sympathy for communism and his works openly dealt with controversial questions of national identity at a time when the communists were propagating the idea of Brotherhood and Unity among the various Yugoslav peoples. Literary historian Andrew B. Wachtel believes that &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;&#x27;s focus on the distant past allowed Andrić to address contemporary social, political and religious issues without overtly abrading the delicate system of inter-ethnic tolerance that the communists had established in the post-war period.

Like almost all of Andrić&#x27;s works, the book was originally written in Serbian Cyrillic. The characters use the Ijekavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian primarily spoken west of the Drina, while the narrator uses the Ekavian dialect spoken primarily in Serbia. This is a reflection of Andrić&#x27;s own linguistic proclivities, as he had abandoned both written and spoken Ijekavian and reverted to Ekavian upon moving to Belgrade in the early 1920s. Both dialogue and narration passages are perfused with Turkisms (), words of Turkish, Arabic or Persian origin that had found their way into the South Slavic languages under Ottoman rule. Turkisms are so prevalent that even the novel&#x27;s title contains one: the word &quot;ćuprija&quot;, derived from the Turkish word &quot;köprü&quot;, which means bridge. Also present are many words of German and Ladino origin, reflecting the historical and political circumstances of the time period described in the novel.

The novel&#x27;s first 100 pages deal with the bridge&#x27;s construction and the remaining 200 revolve around the Austro-Hungarian period. Andrić himself characterized &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; as a chronicle rather than a novel. In the introduction to his English-language translation, Edwards also declined to classify it as a novel, for &quot;its scope is too vast, its characters too numerous, its period of action too long.&quot; Literary scholar Annabel Patterson writes: &quot;There is no hero or heroine to hold it together, nor even a family or dynasty. In place of these there is the bridge, whose birth we attend, whose stability we come to count on.&quot; Patterson hesitates to characterize &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; as a historical novel because most of the events described in it actually occurred as opposed to having been fictionalized. She notes that other scholars have classified it as a &quot;non-fiction novel&quot;, a term she considers superfluous. &quot;If we wish for simplicity,&quot; she writes, &quot;we can call &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; a novel to distinguish it from Andrić&#x27;s collections of short stories. But if we wish for precision, &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; can best be classified as a collection of short stories of peasant life held together by a bridge.&quot; The book deviates from other texts that have been described as chronicles in that the narrator observes events itinerantly and retrospectively. The style of storytelling Andrić employs is often likened to a transcendent historical monologue. Literary scholar Guido Snel believes that such a stylistic interpretation neglects the novel&#x27;s dialogic properties and its ability to act as a back-and-forth between the narrator and reader, drawing a connection between the past described in the novel and the reader&#x27;s present. This has caused Serb scholars to uphold Andrić&#x27;s narrative authority, Snel writes, and Muslim scholars to challenge and reject it.

==Themes and motifs==

&quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; remains Andrić&#x27;s most famous novel and has received the most scholarly attention of all his works. Most scholars interpret the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War, &quot;partaking of both but being neither&quot;. However, at the time of writing, the country did not enjoy the reputation of an inter-civilizational mediator, which was fostered by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito only after his split with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Thus, the novel can be seen as having contributed to the formation of this national self-image. Andrić suggests that the building of roads and bridges by Great Powers is rarely done as a gesture of friendship towards local populations, but rather as a means of facilitating conquest. Thus, the bridge is both a symbol of unification and division. It is a symbol of unification in that it allows the inhabitants of Višegrad to cross from one bank to the other and in that the &quot;kapija&quot; serves as a popular meeting place. On the other hand, it divides the town&#x27;s inhabitants by acting as a constant reminder of the Ottoman conquest.

Michael Sells, a professor of Islamic history and literature, posits that one of the novel&#x27;s main themes is race betrayal. In Andrić&#x27;s view, Sells asserts, Slavs are &quot;racially Christian&quot;, and the conversion of some to Islam is perceived as a great evil epitomized by the practice of &quot;devşirme&quot;. The legend of Christian infants being buried alive within a bridge stems from &quot;The Building of Skadar&quot;, a Serbian epic poem dating back to the Middle Ages. Sells interprets the legend as an allegory for the entrapment of Slav converts to Islam within the structures of an alien religion. He describes Andrić&#x27;s depiction of Muslim characters as mono-dimensional. Muslim Slavs depicted in the novel, he asserts, fall under three types: &quot;the evil Turk&quot;, &quot;the good Turk&quot; and the janissary, who secretly mourns being severed from his Christian brethren. These character depictions, Sells argues, betray Andrić&#x27;s stereotypical notions of Islam. Ani Kokobobo, a professor of Slavic studies, believes violence is a theme that offers conceptual cohesion to the novel&#x27;s otherwise fragmented narrative. The most notable depiction of it is the impalement of Radisav of Unište, who attempts to sabotage the construction of the bridge. Several scholars interpret Radisav&#x27;s impalement as an allegory for the state of Bosnia itself—subjected, vulnerable and fragmented between Christianity and Islam.

The historian Tomislav Dulić interprets the destruction of the bridge at the novel&#x27;s conclusion as having several symbolic meanings. On the one hand, it marks the end of traditional Ottoman life in the town and signals the unstoppable oncome of modernity, while on the other, it foreshadows the death and destruction that await Bosnia and Herzegovina in the future. Dulić describes the ending as &quot;deeply pessimistic&quot;, and attributes Andrić&#x27;s pessimism to the events of World War II.

==Reception and legacy==

The three novels Andrić published in 1945 were an immediate success. &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; was instantly recognized as a classic by the Yugoslav literary establishment. The novel played an important role in shaping Andrić&#x27;s Tito-era reputation as the very embodiment of Yugoslav literature, a &quot;living equivalent to Njegoš&quot;. From its publication in 1945 until the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991–92, the novel was required reading in Yugoslav secondary schools.

The novel&#x27;s literary and historical significance was instrumental in persuading the Swedish Academy to award Andrić the Nobel Prize. In his introduction to Andrić&#x27;s acceptance speech, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences member Göran Liljestrand took note of the symbolic significance of the bridge and described Andrić as a unifying force. &quot;Just as the bridge on the Drina brought East and West together,&quot; Liljestrand said, &quot;so your work has acted as a link, combining the culture of your country with other parts of the planet.&quot; Following Andrić&#x27;s death in 1975, Slovene novelist Ivan Potrč wrote an obituary praising the Nobel Laureate. &quot;Andrić did not merely write &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;,&quot; Potrč remarked. &quot;He built, is building and will continue to build bridges between our peoples and nationalities.&quot;

After being awarded the Nobel Prize, Andrić donated the original manuscript to the city of Sarajevo. The manuscript is kept at the Museum of Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was established as a direct result of Andrić becoming a Nobel laureate, and it is regarded as its most valued possession. In subsequent decades, large sections of the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) literary establishments distanced themselves from Andrić&#x27;s body of work due to his strong ties with Serbian culture. In 1992, at the outset of the Bosnian War, a Bosnian Muslim destroyed a bust of Andrić in Višegrad using a sledgehammer. Later that year, more than 200 Bosniak civilians were killed on the bridge by Bosnian Serb militias and their bodies tossed into the Drina. By 1993, owing to the war and consequent ethnic cleansing, the multi-ethnic Bosnia described in the novel had largely been consigned to history. Andrić and his works, particularly &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;, remain a source of controversy among Bosniaks due to their alleged anti-Muslim undertones. The Turkish writer Elif Shafak has stated that the novel radically changed her perception of Ottoman history. &quot;Suddenly, I had to rethink what I thought I knew,&quot; Shafak wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. &quot;I had to unlearn. What Andrić’s novel did for me at that young age was to shake years of nationalistic education, and whisper into my ears: &quot;Have you ever considered the story from the point of view of the Other?&quot;&quot;

Patterson describes &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; as a seminal work whose themes and motifs—forced labour, invasion, annexation and displacement—would appear frequently in subsequent 20th-century fiction. The town of Višegrad and its historic sites were popularized throughout Yugoslavia as a result of the novel, to which the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge owes its renown. &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; was widely read by Western scholars, reporters and policy makers amidst the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, and sometimes cited as one of the two most important texts ever written about the Balkans, the other being Rebecca West&#x27;s 1941 travel book &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot;. The bridge has been declared a national monument by the Commission to Preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina (KONS), and was recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. In 2011, the Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of a mock-town called Andrićgrad in the vicinity of the bridge. Andrićgrad was officially opened on 28 June 2014, the 100th anniversary of Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination. Kusturica intends to use it as a set for a future cinematic adaption of the novel. In 2019, Pope Francis quoted a passage from the novel at a press conference in Rabat, Morocco while arguing for amity and concord between nations.

<text>GAL (Spanish: &quot;Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación&quot;, &quot;Antiterrorist Liberation Groups&quot;) were death squads illegally established by officials of the Spanish government during the Basque conflict to fight against ETA, the principal Basque separatist militant group. They were active from 1983 to 1987 under Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE)-led governments.

At trial, it was proven that they were financed by high-ranking officials in the Ministry of the Interior. The daily newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; played an important role in exposing GAL when it published a comprehensive series of articles about the squads.

== Background ==
GAL operated primarily in the Basque country on the French side of the Spanish-French border, but kidnappings and torture also took place in Spain. Most victims (at least 27 dead and 26 injured) were ETA members or activist Basque nationalists, but some were not known to have links to ETA or any other organization advocating political violence. GAL was active from 1983 to 1987, a period known as &quot;la guerra sucia&quot; (&quot;the dirty war&quot;) in Spanish history.

Its main purposes were to attack ETA members and Basque nationalist targets and to wreak havoc in French territory to put pressure on the French government.

Apart from the nationalist rationale for its opposition to Basque separatism, GAL was not on the left–right political spectrum; many members were foreign mercenaries. Many of these mercenaries were recruited from the European far right (including the OAS), however, and many perpetrators and organizers were active or former Francoist civil servants.

From its beginning, GAL attacks indicated a close connection to high-ranking officials in the PSOE government and a number of police officials in the Basque Country. In addition to GAL operatives, several Spanish police officers and government officials were convicted and imprisoned when the operation ended. Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his associate, Rafael Vera, were convicted of the kidnapping of Segundo Marey. Gipuzkoa governor Julen Elgorriaga and Civil Guard general Enrique Rodríguez Galindo were found guilty of the murder of Joxe Antonio Lasa and Joxe Ignacio Zabala in October 1983.

After the assassination of PSOE Senator Enrique Casas by the CAA, PSOE officials attempted to assassinate Herri Batasuna representative Santi Brouard. Would-be assassin Jose Luis Morcillo received 7.5 million pesetas from high-ranking Civil Guard official Rafael Masa, as ordered by Spanish State Security chief director Julian Sancristobal. Part of the payment for the attempt on Brouard&#x27;s life, however, was diverted to unknown purposes.
Prosecutors proved that the police officers who recruited mercenaries and the government officials who organized the dirty-war operations also embezzled large amounts of public money. Rafael Vera and others were sentenced for illegal appropriation of funds from the Interior Ministry. To ensure their silence, the PSOE government bribed inspector José Amedo Fouce and Michel Domínguez. Vera was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and his secretary received a nine-month sentence.

Investigative journalists from the newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; reported that Prime Minister and PSOE leader Felipe González was suspected of GAL involvement. Several years of investigation concluded that &quot;Señor X&quot; was the chief official of an organization supervising Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and Vera, but Gonzalez was not named or tried. The CIA eventually identified Señor X as the prime minister. González&#x27; involvement was confirmed by former National Police Corps officer José Manuel Villarejo, who told the Congress of Deputies on October 21, 2021 that González had created GAL.

The death squads were an important issue during the 1996 election, when the PSOE was defeated by José María Aznar&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party (PP) for the first time. González then resigned as PSOE leader. With the exception of Ricardo García Damborenea, PSOE leaders have never acknowledged responsibility for the GAL or condemned their crimes. González, who has never been charged with a GAL-related offence, has called publicly for pardons for his former subordinates. PSOE leaders campaigned for leniency towards their former colleagues, and the Aznar government pardoned several of them.

<doc id="539743" wikidata="Q690174" url="?curid=539743" title="Epic of Manas">
<text>The Epic of Manas is a lengthy and traditional epic poem of the Kyrgyz people of East and Central Asia. Versions of the poem which date to the 19th century contain historical events of the 18th century, though Kyrgyz tradition holds it to be much older. Manas is said to be based on Bars Bek, the first khagan of the Kyrgyz Khaganate. The plot of Manas revolves around a series of events that coincide with the history of the region, primarily the interaction of the Kyrgyz people with other Turkic, Mongolic and Chinese peoples.

The government of Kyrgyzstan celebrated the 1,000th anniversary from the moment it was documented in 1995. The mythic poem has evolved over many centuries, being kept alive by bards called &quot;manaschy&quot; or &quot;manaschi&quot;. The first written reference to the eponymous hero of Manas and his Oirat enemy Joloy is to be found in a Persian manuscript dated to 1792–93. In one of its dozens of iterations, the epic poem consists of approximately 500,000 lines.

==Narrative==

The epic tells the story of Manas, his descendants, and their exploits against various foes. The Epic of Manas is divided into three books. The first is entitled &quot;Manas&quot;, the second episode describes the deeds of his son Semetei, and the third of his grandson Seitek.
The epic begins with the destruction and difficulties caused by the invasion of the Oirats. Jakyp reaches maturity in this time as the owner of many herds without a single heir. His prayers are eventually answered, and on the day of his son&#x27;s birth, he dedicates a colt, Toruchaar, born the same day to his son&#x27;s service. The son is unique among his peers for his strength, mischief, and generosity. The Oirat learn of this young warrior and warn their leader. A plan is hatched to capture the young Manas. They fail in this task, and Manas is able to rally his people and is eventually elected and proclaimed as khan.

Manas expands his reach to include that of the Uyghurs of Raviganjn on the southern border of Jungaria. One of the defeated Uyghur rulers gives his daughter to Manas in marriage. At this point, the Kyrgyz people chose, with Manas&#x27; help, to return from the Altai mountains to their &quot;ancestral lands&quot; in the mountains of modern-day Kyrgyzstan. Manas begins his successful campaigns against his neighbors accompanied by his forty companions. Manas turns eventually to face the Afghan people to the south in battle, where after defeat the Afghans enter into an alliance with Manas. Manas then comes into a relationship with the people of Mā Warāʾ an-Nahr through marriage to the daughter of the ruler of Bukhara.

The epic continues in various forms, depending on the publication and whim of the manaschi, or reciter of the epic.

==History==
Scholars have long debated the exact age of the epic, as it was transmitted orally without being recorded. However, historians have doubted the age claimed for it since the turn of the 20th century. The primary reason is that the events portrayed occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Hatto remarks that Manas was &quot;compiled to glorify the Sufi sheikhs of Shirkent and Kasan ... [and] circumstances make it highly probable that... [Manas] is a late eighteenth-century interpolation.&quot;

Changes were made in the delivery and textual representation particularly the replacement of the tribal background of Manas. In the 19th century versions, Manas is the leader of the Nogay people, while in versions dating after 1920, Manas is a Kyrgyz and a leader of the Kyrgyz. Use of the Manas for nation-building purposes, and the availability of printed historical variants, has similarly had an impact on the performance, content, and appreciation on the epic.

Attempts have been made to connect modern Kyrgyz with the Yenisei Kirghiz, today claimed by Kyrgyzstan to be the ancestors of modern Kyrgyz. Kazakh ethnographer and historian Shokan Shinghisuly Walikhanuli was unable to find evidence of folk-memory during his extended research in 19th-century Kyrgyzstan (then part of the expanding Russian empire) nor has any been found since.

While Kyrgyz historians consider it to be the longest epic poem in history, the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata and the Tibetan Epic of King Gesar are both longer. The distinction is in number of verses. Manas has more verses, though they are shorter.

==Recitation==
Manas is the classic centerpiece of Kyrgyz literature, and parts of it are often recited at Kyrgyz festivities by specialists in the epic, called &quot;Manasçı&quot; (). Manasçıs tell the tale in a melodic chant unaccompanied by musical instruments.

Kyrgyzstan has many Manasçıs. Narrators who know all three episodes of the epic (the tales of Manas, of his son Semetey and of his grandson Seytek) can acquire the status of Great Manasçı. Great Manasçıs of the 20th century are Sagımbay Orozbakov, Sayakbay Karalaev, Şaabay Azizov (pictured), Kaba Atabekov, Seydene Moldokova and Yusup Mamay. Contemporary Manasçıs include Rysbek Jumabayev, who has performed at the British Library, Urkaş Mambetaliev, the Manasçı of the Bishkek Philharmonic (also travels through Europe), Talantaaly Bakchiev, who combines recitation with critical study, and Doolot Sydykov, noted for lengthy performances (including a 111 hour recitation over five days). Adil Jumaturdu has provided &quot;A comparative study of performers of the &quot;Manas&quot; epic.&quot; 

There are more than 65 written versions of parts of the epic. Arthur Thomas Hatto made scholarly editions with facing English translations of the Manas tales recorded in the 19th century by Shokan Valikhanov and Vasily Radlov. An English translation of the version of Sagımbay Orozbakov by Walter May was published in 1995 as part of the commemoration of the presumed 1000th anniversary of Manas&#x27; birth (and re-issued in two volumes in 2004), and a substantial episode of this variant translated by Daniel Prior was published in 2022.

==Legacy==
Manas is said to have been buried in the Ala-Too mountains in Talas Province, in northwestern Kyrgyzstan. A mausoleum some 40 km east of the town of Talas is believed to house his remains and is a popular destination for Kyrgyz travellers. Traditional Kyrgyz horsemanship games are held there every summer since 1995. An inscription on the mausoleum states, however, that it is dedicated to &quot;...the most famous of women, Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the emir Abuka&quot;. Legend has it that Kanikey, Manas&#x27; widow, ordered this inscription in an effort to confuse her husband&#x27;s enemies and prevent a defiling of his grave. The name of the building is &quot;Manastin Khumbuzu&quot; or &quot;The Dome of Manas&quot;, and the date of its erection is unknown. There is a museum dedicated to Manas and his legend nearby the tomb.

The reception of the poem in the USSR was problematic. Politician and government official Kasym Tynystanov tried to get the poem published in 1925, but this was prevented by the growing influence of Stalinism. The first extract of the poem to be published in the USSR appeared in Moscow in 1946, and efforts to nominate the poem for the Stalin Prize in 1946 were unsuccessful. Ideologist Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin&#x27;s &quot;propagandist in chief&quot;, prevented this, calling the poem an example of &quot;bourgeois cosmopolitanism&quot;. The struggle continued inside Kyrgyzstan, with different newspapers and authors taking different sides; one of its supporters was Tugolbay Sydykbekov. By 1952 the poem was called anti-Soviet and anti-Chinese and condemned as pan-Islamic. Chinghiz Aitmatov, in the 1980s, picked up the cause for the poem again, and in 1985 finally a statue for the hero was erected.

In 2023, the manuscript version of the epic was included by international organization UNESCO in the Memory of the World Programme.

<text>Liberty, formerly, and still formally, called the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), is an advocacy group and membership organisation based in the United Kingdom, which challenges unjust laws, protects civil liberties and promotes human rights. It does this through the courts, in Parliament and in the wider community. Liberty also aims to engender a &quot;rights culture&quot; within British society. The NCCL was founded in 1934 by Ronald Kidd and Sylvia Crowther-Smith (later Scaffardi), motivated by their humanist convictions.

During the 1950s, the NCCL campaigned for reform of the mental health system, under which people known to be sane but deemed &#x27;morally defective&#x27; – unmarried mothers, for example – could be locked up in an asylum. By 1957, the campaign had seen the release of around 2,000 inmates, the abolition of the Mental Deficiency Act 1913, and the establishment of new Mental Health Review Tribunals which culminated in the Mental Health Act 1959.

Since 2016, Liberty&#x27;s work has been dominated by a High Court challenge to the Investigatory Powers Act, as well as campaigning against the so-called &#x27;hostile environment&#x27; policies which allow indefinite immigration detention in the UK.

In autumn 2019, the organisation set up Liberty Investigates, an editorially independent journalism unit. Its initial focus was on how the coronavirus pandemic affects Human Rights in the UK.

== History ==

===Foundation and early years===

The immediate spur to the organisation&#x27;s formation was the National Hunger March 1932. The first Secretary was Ronald Kidd, and first President was the novelist E. M. Forster; vice-presidents were the politician and author A. P. Herbert and the journalist Kingsley Martin of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. H. G. Wells, Lewis Clive, Vera Brittain, Clement Attlee, Rebecca West, Edith Summerskill and Harold Laski were also founder members.

The National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) was founded in 1934. The inaugural meeting took place in the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London on 22 February. A letter published in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspapers announced the formations of the group, citing &quot;the general and alarming tendency to encroachment on the liberty of the citizen&quot; as the reason for its establishment. The first campaign was against the criminalisation of pacifist or anti-war literature. Under the proposed Incitement to Disaffection Bill, commonly known as the &#x27;Sedition Bill&#x27;, it would have been a criminal offence to possess pacifist literature, for example anti-war pamphlets. Although the Bill became law as the Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934, NCCL succeeded in watering it down. Other prominent early themes included campaigning against fascists, against film censorship and support for striking miners in Nottinghamshire.

=== World War II ===
When Oswald Mosley was released from prison in 1943 (he had been imprisoned without trial under Defence Regulation 18B), the National Council for Civil Liberties demanded his continued imprisonment. A.W. Brian Simpson notes that the NCCL &quot;had become an enthusiastic supporter of detention without trial&quot;. Harold Nicolson and 38 others resigned from the NCCL over the issue.

=== Liberty ===

In 1989, NCCL rebranded as &quot;Liberty&quot;. During this period, the organisation was headed by Andrew Puddephatt and John Wadham.

On 10 September 2001, Shami Chakrabarti joined Liberty. After working as in-house counsel, she was appointed director of Liberty in 2003. As director, she began campaigning against what the pressure group saw as the &quot;excessive&quot; anti-terrorist measures that followed the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, such as the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCSA). Liberty became increasingly high-profile, with Chakrabarti making regular appearances in the media. She was described in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper as &quot;the most effective public affairs lobbyist of the past 20 years&quot;.

Since the 2015 UK general election, Liberty has spearheaded the campaign to save the Human Rights Act. In August 2015, Chakrabarti said Liberty intended to become &quot;more vigilant and active&quot; in Scotland. She later shared a platform with Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to jointly defend the HRA.

In January 2016 it emerged that Chakrabarti was standing down as Liberty&#x27;s director. Martha Spurrier took up the post at the end of May.

Since 2016, Liberty&#x27;s work has been dominated by taking a High Court challenge to the Investigatory Powers Act, and campaigning against the so-called &#x27;hostile environment&#x27; policies and for an end to the use of indefinite immigration detention in the UK. In autumn 2019, the organisation set up Liberty Investigates, an editorially independent journalism unit that sits within Liberty. The unit formally launched in April 2020 with an initial focus on how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Human Rights in the UK.

In January 2024, Akiko Hart took over the role of director of Liberty.

== Campaigns ==

===Post-war===

BBC ban

During the 1940s, the NCCL led protests against a BBC ban on artists who attended a &#x27;People&#x27;s Convention&#x27; organised by the Communist Party.

Soldiers&#x27; civil liberties

In the years following the Second World War, the NCCL campaigned for better civil liberties protections for members of the Armed Forces, including for better education and vocational training, a fairer military justice system and freedom of voluntary association.

Miscarriages of justice

At this time NCCL was also involved in several miscarriage of justice cases, including that of Emery, Powers and Thompson, who were sentenced to between four and ten years&#x27; imprisonment for assaulting a police officer, even though someone else confessed to the crime and the prosecution evidence was flawed. NCCL found a witness who confirmed the men&#x27;s alibi and they were released from prison and granted a royal pardon.

Reform of the Mental Health System

During the 1950s NCCL campaigned for reform of the mental health system, under which people known to be sane but deemed &#x27;morally defective&#x27; – unmarried mothers, for example – could be locked up in an asylum.

By 1957, the campaign had seen the release of around 2,000 former inmates, the abolition of the Mental Health Act 1913 and the establishment of new Mental Health Review Tribunals and the Mental Health Act 1959.

===1960–1974===

In the 1960s the organisation broadened its scope, particularly from 1966 under new general secretary Tony Smythe. It campaigned on racial issues, on behalf of gypsies, children, prisoners and servicemen who had changed their decision about joining the forces. This broader range of campaigning resulted in a large rise in membership and a higher profile in the media.
It campaigned for the retaining of the public right to petition the ECHR, its General Secretary Martin Loney writing to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath. However, Loney was controversially sacked by the executive of the NCCL led by its chair, Henry Hodge.

Opposition to racial discrimination

After 1960, NCCL responded to the tightening of immigration laws and a rise in race-hate incidents by lobbying for the Race Relations Act, which came into force in 1965. NCCL also published pamphlets exposing the effective &#x27;colour bar&#x27;, whereby black and Asian people were refused service in certain pubs and hotels.

Following Conservative MP Enoch Powell&#x27;s Rivers of Blood speech in 1968 the NCCL set about organising an emergency &quot;Speak out on Race&quot; meeting and also presented an NCCL petition to the Prime Minister.

Women&#x27;s rights

Campaigning for women&#x27;s rights was also a major part of NCCL&#x27;s work in this period, including successfully calling for reform of jury service laws that effectively prevented women and the poor from serving on juries by means of a property qualification.

Right to public protest

NCCL intervened on behalf of groups refused permission to protest and monitoring the policing of demonstrations such as those against the Vietnam War.

Support for reluctant servicemen

NCCL also campaigned to raise awareness of the difficulty faced by &#x27;reluctant servicemen&#x27; – men in the armed forces who had often signed up as teenagers then realised they&#x27;d made a mistake but were prevented from discharging themselves for anything up to 16 years.

Northern Ireland

In 1972 NCCL campaigned for civil rights in Northern Ireland.

Data protection

In 1975 NCCL bought 3 million credit rating files from Konfax Ltd after they were offered for sale in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The files were destroyed and the major privacy protection &#x27;Right to Know&#x27; campaign to give individuals greater control over their personal information was launched in 1977.

===1975–1989===
Near the end of 1974, Patricia Hewitt, later a Labour cabinet minister, was appointed as general secretary. A number of other future high-profile Labour politicians worked at the organisation at this time, such as Harriet Harman, who worked as the legal officer from 1978 to 1982, Jack Dromey, later her husband, was a member (1970–79) and chairman of the executive committee, and Diane Abbott was employed as Race Relations Officer (1978–80).

Paedophilia

In 1976, the NCCL in a submission to the Criminal Law Revision Committee of the British Parliament argued that &quot;Childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult result in no identifiable damage… The real need is a change in the attitude which assumes that all cases of paedophilia result in lasting damage&quot;. The NCCL also sought to place the &quot;onus of proof on the prosecution to show that the child was actually harmed&quot; rather than having a blanket ban on child pornography and advocated the decriminalisation of incest. Organisations such as Paedophile Information Exchange (P.I.E.), a pro-paedophile activist group, and Paedophile Action for Liberation became affiliated to the pressure group. Prominent pro-paedophile activist Tom O&#x27;Carroll also sat on the NCCL&#x27;s sub-committee for gay rights. Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty, issued an apology about the links between the NCCL and the PIE. In December 2013, she said: &quot;It is a source of continuing disgust and horror that even the NCCL had to expel paedophiles from its ranks in 1983 after infiltration at some point in the 70s.&quot;

Gay rights and censorship

NCCL acted for the owners of &quot;Gay&#x27;s the Word&quot; bookshop, whose stock was confiscated by Customs officers in 1984. All charges were dropped in 1986.

Miners&#x27; strike

During the miners&#x27; strike, NCCL campaigned on behalf of miners stopped from picketing outside their home regions.

MI5 surveillance

The European Court of Human Rights ruled that MI5 surveillance of Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt during the pair&#x27;s tenure at Liberty breached the European Convention on Human Rights.

===1990–2004===

Detention without charge

During the Gulf War, Liberty successfully campaigned for the release of more than 100 Iraqi nationals – some of whom were openly opposed to Saddam Hussein – detained without charge in Britain on the grounds that they posed a risk to national security.

Miscarriage of justice

Throughout the 1990s Liberty focused again on miscarriage of justice cases and campaigned for reform of the criminal justice system. High-profile cases included that of the Birmingham Six, who were released after 16 years in prison for IRA bombings they did not commit.

Human Rights Act

At the start of the 2000s, Liberty used the protections in the new Human Rights Act 1998 to fight a number of landmark cases. Including supporting terminally ill Diane Pretty&#x27;s fight to die with dignity and Christine Goodwin&#x27;s fight for transgender rights.

A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department

Liberty intervened in the long-running &quot;A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot; case following which the Law Lords ruled that detaining non-British nationals without trial was unlawful. In a 2005 judgment the Law Lords also confirmed that evidence obtained through torture was not admissible in British courts.

Katharine Gun

In 2004, Liberty acted for the translator and whistleblower Katharine Gun who claimed that the American National Security Agency had requested the British Government&#x27;s help in illegal surveillance on the UN. She was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act 1989. The charges were dropped when the prosecution failed to offer any evidence.

=== 2005–2014 ===

Pre-charge detention

During 2007 and 2008 Liberty led the opposition to government plans to extend detention without charge for those suspected of terrorism to 42 days. Chakrabarti and Liberty claimed a major campaign victory when the government dropped the proposal after it was rejected by the House of Lords in October 2008.

Gooch Gang

In April 2009, Liberty protested against a poster campaign by Greater Manchester Police which depicted a series of notorious Manchester gangsters, the Gooch Gang, as pensioners. The billboard campaign used computer-generated images of Colin Joyce and Lee Amos to show how the &quot;aged&quot; criminals would look when they are finally released from prison in the 2040s. Liberty supported claims that the posters should be removed following complaints from family members of the gangsters, not involved with their relatives&#x27; criminality, who claimed they were being targeted in the community after the posters were erected.

Cream of Conscience

November 2011 saw Liberty successfully assist in preventing Westminster City Council from implementing a proposed byelaw which would have essentially criminalised &quot;soup runs&quot; within areas of Southwark.

Freedom Games?

In response to the vast security systems which were put in place ahead of the London 2012 Olympic Games, Liberty raised concerns with regards to the infringements to civil liberties which would subsequently occur. Liberty argued that neither peaceful protest nor the right to free speech were a factor in ensuring the safety of the Games.

For their eyes only

Another prominent campaign in 2012 was &quot;For their eyes only&quot; in response to the proposed Justice and Security Bill which was introduced in the House of Lords on 28 May 2012. The Bill was introduced as a result of prolific media investigations and litigation surrounding the UK Government and proposed &quot;secret courts&quot; and evidence which would be non-disclosable. A campaign presence and attendance by Shami Chakrabarti at the Liberal Democrats Conference in September 2012 in Brighton successfully led to the passing of a motion by Jo Shaw, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Spokesperson for Holborn and St Pancras, against the Bill. Nevertheless, the substantially unchanged Bill became law in April 2013.

Extradition Watch

A prominent campaign by Liberty was in relation to fairer extradition laws and the opposition of unfair extradition proceedings, the most prominent case being that of Gary McKinnon who gained worldwide press attention. Other prolific cases included that of Babar Ahmed, Talha Ahsan and Christopher Tappin.

Gary McKinnon

16 October 2012 saw a victory for Gary McKinnon, after a decade-long ordeal, as the Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced that she was refusing to allow Gary&#x27;s extradition to the US on the basis that doing so would breach his Human Rights. Gary McKinnon was charged in 2002 of hacking into US military and NASA systems, but maintains that he was looking for UFOs and evidence of free energy suppression. Gary, who has Asperger syndrome, could have spent up to 70 years in a US jail if convicted and it was argued by his lawyers in an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that because of this factor and because the crime was committed in the UK that he should be tried in the UK. Director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti said of the Home Secretary&#x27;s decision &quot;This is a great day for rights, freedoms and justice in the United Kingdom.&quot; The Home Office also admitted that it was the Human Rights Act which essentially prevented the extradition.

Gay rights

Liberty intervened in the case of gay couple Michael Black and John Morgan who were turned away from a bed and breakfast because of the owner&#x27;s religious views. On 18 October 2012 it was ruled that the B&amp;B owner was in breach of equality legislation by unlawfully discriminating against the couple on the basis of their sexual orientation. Liberty&#x27;s Legal Director James Welch said of the decision &quot;Hopefully today&#x27;s ruling signals the death knell of such &#x27;no gays&#x27; policies – policies that would never be tolerated if they referred to a person&#x27;s race, gender or religion.&quot;

=== 2015 onwards ===

==== Save our Human Rights Act ====
Immediately following the 2015 general election result, Liberty launched a campaign to save the Human Rights Act. The Conservative Party – which had won a majority – had included a pledge in its manifesto to repeal the Act. Liberty called this &quot;a knowing attempt by Government ministers to hand itself the right to end the universality of human rights and choose when and to whom they apply&quot;.

In May 2016, Liberty, Amnesty International UK and the British Institute of Human Rights published a statement opposing repeal of the Act, backed by more than 130 organisations including UK Families Flight 103, Friends of the Earth, Refuge, Quakers in Britain, Stonewall, the Terrence Higgins Trust, the Down&#x27;s Syndrome Association and the Football Supporters&#x27; Federation.

In July 2015, Liberty coordinated an intervention from a number of former Anti-Apartheid campaigners including Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane and Denis Goldberg.

==== The Deepcut inquests ====
Liberty represents the families of three of four young soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at Deepcut army barracks between 1995 and 2002 – Cheryl James, Sean Benton and James Collinson. Liberty used the Human Rights Act to compel Surrey Police to disclose evidence about the deaths to the families, which they were then able to use to apply for fresh inquests.

The second inquest into the death of Cheryl James took place at Woking Coroner&#x27;s Court from January to April 2016. On 3 June 2016, Coroner Brian Barker QC recorded a verdict of suicide, delivering a narrative verdict that strongly condemned the culture at Deepcut. Following the verdict, Liberty called for reform to tackle the &quot;pervasive sexualised culture&quot; in the Armed Forces.

The second inquest into the death of Sean Benton also took place from January to June 2018, also in Woking. On 18 July 2018, Coroner Peter Rook QC also recorded a verdict of suicide and again strongly criticised failings at Deepcut and in the Surrey Police investigation. Following the verdict, Liberty and Sean&#x27;s family called for all serious crimes within the Armed Forces to be investigated by the civilian police, rather than the Royal Military Police.

==== Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement ====
Liberty represented the family of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, a Royal Military Police Office who took her own life in 2011 after alleging that she had been raped by two colleagues. The allegations were investigated by military police themselves, and no charges were brought.

An initial inquest in March 2012 recorded a verdict of suicide, but Anne-Marie&#x27;s family, represented by Liberty, used the Human Rights Act to secure a second, more thorough inquest. They alleged that Anne-Marie had been bullied and that the Royal Military Police had failed in their duty of care.

On 3 July 2014, Nicholas Rheinberg – Coroner in the second inquest – ruled that bullying, the lingering effect of the alleged rape and &quot;work-related despair&quot; had contributed to Anne-Marie&#x27;s suicide.

In 2013, Anne-Marie&#x27;s family, represented by Liberty, also used the threat of legal action under the Human Rights Act to compel the Ministry of Defence and Royal Military Police to agree to refer the Anne-Marie&#x27;s rape allegations for a fresh, independent investigation. This was carried out by RAF Police and Bedfordshire Police, overseen by the Crown Prosecution Service.

On 29 October 2015, the Service Prosecuting Authority announced that two former soldiers had been charged with raping Anne-Marie and stated that &quot;the original decision by the SPA not to prosecute was &#x27;wrong&#x27;&quot;. The two men were acquitted on 20 April 2016.

In October 2016, the Royal Military Police apologised to Anne-Marie&#x27;s family for failings and mistakes in the original rape investigation.

In November 2017, the Ministry of Defence announced it would stop Commanding Officers investigating allegations of sexual assault themselves – a call Liberty had made from Corporal Ellement&#x27;s 2014 inquest.

==== Mass surveillance ====
Following Edward Snowden&#x27;s whistleblowing in 2013, mass surveillance became a major part of Liberty&#x27;s work.

Shortly after the revelations, Liberty brought a legal challenge to the UK government&#x27;s practices with a coalition of other organisations, including Amnesty International, Privacy International and ACLU. In September 2018, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that GCHQ&#x27;s bulk interception practices had violated privacy rights and failed to provide sufficient safeguards.

In 2014, Liberty represented MPs David Davis and Tom Watson in a legal challenge to the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA), claiming that it breached privacy rights. The case was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the Court of Appeal, and in December 2016 the ECJ ruled that the general and indiscriminate retention of emails and electronic communications by governments was illegal. In January 2018, the Court of Appeal found DRIPA unlawful.

Throughout 2016, Liberty campaigned against what it believed to be a serious lack of privacy safeguards in the Investigatory Powers Bill. The Bill passed in November 2016. In January 2017, Liberty launched a crowdfunder to raise funds to challenge the Act in the High Court, raising more than £53,000 in a week.

Liberty&#x27;s challenge to various parts of the Investigatory Powers Act is ongoing. In April 2018, the High Court issued its ruling on the first part of the challenge, giving the government six months to rewrite core parts of the Act, which it found incompatible with EU law.

==== Equal pensions for same-sex couples ====
Liberty represented John Walker in a legal challenge to a loophole in the Equality Act which let employers exempt same-sex spouses from spousal pension benefits. Upon retirement from Innospec, John had discovered that his husband would only receive a few hundred pounds a year. If he were married to a woman, she would have received around £45,000.

In July 2017, the Supreme Court found the loophole unlawful under EU law.

==== Hostile environment policies ====
Liberty campaigned against the introduction of the &#x27;hostile environment&#x27; policies and has since campaigned for their repeal. It has also campaigned against data-sharing arrangements between immigration enforcement and public services including hospitals, schools and police. In August 2017, Liberty exposed that the Home Office had secretly gained access to nationality data on homeless people in London.

==== Facial recognition ====
In June 2018, Liberty announced it would be representing Cardiff resident Ed Bridges in a legal challenge to South Wales Police&#x27;s use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. Liberty argues that the technology &quot;is dangerously inaccurate and has the potential to trample on the freedoms we all take for granted&quot;.

Immigration detention

In January 2017, Liberty launched a campaign calling for a 28-day statutory limit on immigration detention in the UK.

== Organisation ==

Liberty is both a non-profit company that employs staff and runs campaigns, and a member-based association. Both work closely with the Civil Liberties Trust. Liberty is divided into three organisations:

* Liberty – an unincorporated association

<text>In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, a ring is called a reduced ring if it has no non-zero nilpotent elements. Equivalently, a ring is reduced if it has no non-zero elements with square zero, that is, &quot;x&quot;2 = 0 implies &quot;x&quot; = 0. A commutative algebra over a commutative ring is called a reduced algebra if its underlying ring is reduced.

The nilpotent elements of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; form an ideal of &quot;R&quot;, called the nilradical of &quot;R&quot;; therefore a commutative ring is reduced if and only if its nilradical is zero. Moreover, a commutative ring is reduced if and only if the only element contained in all prime ideals is zero.

A quotient ring &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is reduced if and only if &quot;I&quot; is a radical ideal.

Let formula_1 denote nilradical of a commutative ring formula_2. There is a functor formula_3 of the category of commutative rings formula_4 into the category of reduced rings formula_5 and it is left adjoint to the inclusion functor formula_6 of formula_5 into formula_4. The natural bijection formula_9 is induced from the universal property of quotient rings.

Let &quot;D&quot; be the set of all zero-divisors in a reduced ring &quot;R&quot;. Then &quot;D&quot; is the union of all minimal prime ideals.

Over a Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot;, we say a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; has locally constant rank if formula_10 is a locally constant (or equivalently continuous) function on Spec &quot;R&quot;. Then &quot;R&quot; is reduced if and only if every finitely generated module of locally constant rank is projective.

==Examples and non-examples==
* Subrings, products, and localizations of reduced rings are again reduced rings.
* The ring of integers Z is a reduced ring. Every field and every polynomial ring over a field (in arbitrarily many variables) is a reduced ring.
* More generally, every integral domain is a reduced ring since a nilpotent element is a fortiori a zero-divisor. On the other hand, not every reduced ring is an integral domain; for example, the ring Z[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;]/(&quot;xy&quot;) contains &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;xy&quot;) and &quot;y&quot; + (&quot;xy&quot;) as zero-divisors, but no non-zero nilpotent elements. As another example, the ring Z × Z contains (1, 0) and (0, 1) as zero-divisors, but contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.
* The ring Z/6Z is reduced, however Z/4Z is not reduced: the class 2 + 4Z is nilpotent. In general, Z/&quot;n&quot;Z is reduced if and only if &quot;n&quot; = 0 or &quot;n&quot; is square-free.
* If &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring and &quot;N&quot; is its nilradical, then the quotient ring &quot;R&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is reduced.
* A commutative ring &quot;R&quot; of prime characteristic &quot;p&quot; is reduced if and only if its Frobenius endomorphism is injective (cf. Perfect field.)

==Generalizations==
Reduced rings play an elementary role in algebraic geometry, where this concept is generalized to the notion of a reduced scheme.

<doc id="539752" wikidata="Q444899" url="?curid=539752" title="Yoriko Kawaguchi">
<text>is a Japanese politician. Born in Tokyo, she holds a BA in international relations from the University of Tokyo, and an MPhil in economics from Yale University, where she became a member of President&#x27;s Council on International Activities. Currently, she is a professor at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs in Tokyo.

Kawaguchi is a former Minister of the Environment of Japan from 2000 to 2002. Subsequently, she served Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2004 and continued as a special adviser to the Japanese prime minister for foreign affairs from 2004 to 2005. She was also a member of the House of Councillors for the Liberal Democratic Party from 2005 to 2013. In July 2008, she was appointed cochair of a new International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, with former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans.

== Career ==

A former economist at the World Bank, Kawaguchi served as Minister at the Embassy of Japan to the United States in 1990. She worked as a Director General of Global Environmental Affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (now Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) between 1992 and 1993 before becoming a Managing Director of Suntory Holdings Ltd. in September 1993. In 2000, Kawaguchi was the director-general of the Environment Agency.

She was elected to the House of Councillors in 2005, serving two terms through 2013. During her years as a Diet member, she served as deputy chair of the General Assembly of Liberal Democratic Party members in the Upper House. She also became the director and chair of the Environment Committee, director of the Budget Committee and director of the Commission on the Constitution. Kawaguchi served as chair of the LDP Okinawa Promotion Committee as well as co-chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament and a board member of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders Foundation in 2008. Currently, she is a member of the Tokyo Foundation CSR Committee.

=== Controversies ===

Kawaguchi, then a senior lawmaker of the ruling coalition Liberal Democratic Party, was ousted from her post as head of the Environment Committee of the House of Councillors when Japan&#x27;s Upper House passed a resolution to fire her back in May 2013. This was due to her unauthorized extension of stay in China which made the panel she led cancel a scheduled session.

Kawaguchi earned the approval of the parliament to go to China from April 23 to 24 to attend a conference but without prior permission, she extended for one more day to meet foreign policy official State Councilor Yang Jiechi. Kawaguchi apologizes to Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, who is also the head of the LDP, of her unannounced leave but reasons that the last-minute arrangements with Yang was for Japan&#x27;s best interests. This extension gained a lot of criticisms from the opposition parties as Kawaguchi violated parliamentary rules as well neglected her duties. However those who are in defense of the lawmaker such as Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and LDP Secretary General Shigeru Ishiba say that the meeting between the two ministers was in order to address the territorial dispute going on between Japan and China in the East China Sea.

The meeting was considered a rare chance given the escalated tensions going on between the two countries and that this might not be possible again anytime in the near future. This commotion by the opposition was then seen as a futile attempt to weaken the power of LDP seeing as they control the Lower House and they might take hold of the Upper House with the upcoming elections. However, on May 9, 2013, the resolution of ousting Kawaguchi was passed despite the attempts of administration officials to defend her intentions. The cancelled session scheduled on April 25 was the basis of the resolution and dismissal. Furthermore, her actions were perceived as disrespect of the power of the Upper House and her duties. The resolution was backed up by 7 opposition parties who then had the control of the Upper House.

=== Honors and awards ===

In December 2003, Kawaguchi received the “Aguila Azteca Medal” from Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican States. She is a recipient of an Anniversary Medal from the mayor of Sankt-Peterburg during the 300th anniversary of the city. March 2004, the Republic of Paraguay awarded Kawaguchi with the “Gran Cruz Extraordinaria” (National Testimonial Medal). She also received a Certificate of Doctor Honoris Causa by the authority of the Academic Council of the National University of Mongolia in September 2004. In October 2008, Kawaguchi received a Wilbur Cross Medal from Yale University for distinguished public service. She was also awarded “Star of Jerusalem” in October 2010 by Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority. October the following year, she received once again an Anniversary Medal for a major contribution to global security promotion and non-proliferation regime by K. Kadyrzhanov, Director General of the National Nuclear Center.

<text>Rovinj (; Venetian and Italian: Rovigno; Istriot: or ; ; ) is a city in west Croatia situated on the north Adriatic Sea with a population of 14,294 (2011). Located on the western coast of the Istrian peninsula, it is a popular tourist resort and beach destination, in addition to being an active fishing port. Istriot, a Romance language once widely spoken in this part of Istria, is still spoken by some of the residents. The town is officially bilingual, Croatian and Italian, hence both town names are official and equal.

==History==


Rovinj was already a settlement of Venetian or Illyrian tribes before being captured by the Romans, who called it &quot;Arupinium&quot; or &quot;Mons Rubineus&quot;, and later &quot;Ruginium&quot; and &quot;Ruvinium&quot;. Built on an island close to the coast, it became connected to the mainland much later, in 1763, by filling in the channel.

Rovinj was eventually incorporated into the Byzantine Empire, later becoming part of the Exarchate of Ravenna in the 6th century, before being taken over by the Frankish Empire in 788. For the following several centuries it was ruled by a succession of feudal lords, and in 1209 it was acquired by the Patriarchate of Aquileia under Wolfger von Erla.

From 1283 to 1797, Rovinj was one of the most important towns in Istria governed by the Republic of Venice. During this period, three town gates were constructed and Rovinj was fortified by two rows of defensive walls, remains of which can still be seen today. The Rovinj pier is home to one of the old town gates, &quot;Balbi&#x27;s Arch&quot;, dating from 1680, and a late-Renaissance clock tower. The first city statute was proclaimed in 1531.

Following the fall of Venice in 1797 and the ensuing Napoleonic interlude, Rovinj became part of the Austrian Empire, which lasted until World War I. According to the last Austrian census in 1911, 97.8% of the population was Italian-speaking. Rovinj then belonged to Kingdom of Italy from 1918 to 1947, when it was ceded to SFR Yugoslavia, as part of SR Croatia. The original town name &quot;Rovigno&quot; was then changed to &quot;Rovinj.&quot; During the post-war period, many Italian inhabitants left Rovigno, leading to significant changes in the city&#x27;s demographic structure.

Following Croatia&#x27;s independence in 1991, Rovinj became one of the most important centers of Istria County, an administrative unit encompassing most of Istria. Rovinj is today the third most populous town in the county, behind Pula-Pola and Poreč.

==Economy==

The main economic activity in Rovinj is tourism and during peak season (May–September), its bars, restaurants and art galleries work long hours, while operating limited hours off-season.

The busiest area is the very centre of Rovinj, extending from the main bus station towards the old part of town, where most bars and clubs are located.

The town&#x27;s main central thoroughfare is the fully pedestrian Carera Street, with many independent shops and art galleries. A farmer&#x27;s market is located at the edge of the historic part of town, near Valdibora Square.

According to data compiled by Istria Tourist Board, Rovinj is the second biggest tourist destination in the county, in terms of overnight stays. The two closest airports are in Pula (Croatia) and Trieste (Italy). During the summer season, low-cost airlines, such as Ryanair, operate direct flights from western Europe to both airports. Easyjet operates flights between cities in the United Kingdom and Pula-Pola in the summer months.

There are numerous hotels in the town itself, and beds are abundant though usually overbooked in the summer months. Accommodation ranges from private rooms or apartments to bungalows, camping sites and 2- to 5-star hotels. The city also has three luxury, 5-star hotels: Hotel Monte Mulini, Hotel Lone and Grand Park Hotel Rovinj, all owned by hotel group Maistra. Apart from hotels on the mainland, there are also a handful of hotels on small islands surrounding Rovinj which are linked to the mainland by boats which go from the city centre to the hotel on the islands.

==Sights and landmarks==

* St. Euphemia&#x27;s Basilica
* Monkodonja
* Zlatni Rt Forest Park
* The Rovinj islands and mainland. These natural sights have been described as &quot;outstanding scenic wonders,&quot; because of the pristine beauty of the indented coastline and its forests, consisting of holm oak and Alpine pine trees. This area &quot;of outstanding natural beauty&quot; extends from St. Ivan promontory to Barbariga, including all the Rovinj islands and the mainland 500 metres from the shore line. The Rovinj archipelago consists of 19 islands.
* Limska Draga
* The Palud marsh and the Dvije Sestrice Islands – The Dvije Sestrice (Two Sisters) islands are a nesting site for seagulls. Because of its thick holm oak forest, the Gustinja promontory is regarded as &quot;a forest vegetation reserve.&quot;
* Rovinj Town Museum

==Transportation==
The preferred means of transport for getting around Rovinj is by car. Rovinj is well-connected with the rest of Istria and with larger cities in the region such as Trieste, Venice, Rijeka-Fiume, Ljubljana and Zagreb.

The centre of Rovinj, which includes the old town, is very walkable and transportation by bike or scooter is a preferred means of getting around for many locals.

The closest commercial international airports are Pula (20 miles), Trieste-Ronchi (70 miles) and Rijeka-Krk (80 miles). The closest major international airports are Venice and Zagreb. Car rental is available at each of the airports. During the summer season, Venice is connected to Rovinj via a direct ferry line which takes about 2.5 hours one way. 

Rovinj is served by the Kanfanar railway station (10 miles), which connects the region to Rijeka-Fiume. However, travelling by bus is preferred to travelling by train due to the limited connections and schedules. The main bus station is located at the south-east end of Carera Street.

Between 1876 and 1966, Rovinj was connected to Kanfanar via a branch line of the Istriani Railway, which was closed supposedly due to heavy motorisation investments by Yugoslavia. Most of the tracks and stations, even though they have been sold by JŽ, can still be seen.

Also during the summer season, there is a direct high speed ferry link between Venice and Rovinj. High speed weekly lines to the Port of Ravenna and Cesenatico were also available in the summer season until 2012/13, when Emilia-Romagna lines, its operator, closed for insolvency.

<text>Pazin (, ) is a town in western Croatia, the administrative seat of Istria County. It is known for the medieval Pazin Castle, the former residence of the Istrian margraves.

==Geography==
The town had a population of 8,638 in 2011, of which 4,386 lived in the urban settlement. In 1991 it was made the capital of the county for its location in the geographical centre of the Istrian peninsula and in order to boost the development of its interior territories.

==History==


Pazin was built in an area rich in history and inhabited since ancient times. The burg surrounding the castle was inhabited since prehistory. Some of the surrounding rural settlements, such as Glavizza, Beram, which features a necropolis dating from the 7th to 5th century BC, and the &quot;castellieri&quot; of Bertossi, likewise inhabited since prehistoric times, developed into urban centers, while others became burgs around newly built castles, and others still remained rural villages. Just to its southeast lie Gračišče, &quot;castrum Callinianum&quot; in Roman times, and Pićan, which was settled by the Histri, and then became a strategically important Roman military settlement under the name &quot;Petina&quot;. Some historians also link it to &quot;Pucinium&quot;, an unidentified fortification in central Istria, whose wine was famous even at the Roman court, with Livia, wife of Emperor Augustus, believing that her longevity was due to it. Just to the north of Pazin lies Draguć, formerly part of the County of Pazin as well as the Pazin county, which was a Roman fortification, and where numerous Roman archaeological finds were uncovered. The areas of Pazin, Draguć, Buzet and Roč ( an important Roman &quot;castrum&quot; since the 2nd century BC) are rich in Roman finds.

The current settlement of Pazin originated with the houses built around a castle erected by Germanic rulers. These were the houses of the family relatives and feudal settlers, to which were later added those of the foreign artisans, who offered their services to the lords of the castle as well as their employees and subjects. Thus a little burg was born, which was greatly developed when Pazin was enfeoffed to the bishops of Poreč and the town became the capital and center of the County of Pazin. Thus the small burg increased its population, both with commoners and nobles, who embellished it with new buildings, such as the hospice founded by Giovanni Mosconi, then the captain of Pazin.

Pazin was first mentioned as &quot;Castrum Pisinum&quot; in a 983 deed regarding a donation by Emperor Otto II to the Diocese of Poreč. It then belonged to the Imperial March of Istria, which had originally been under the suzerainty of the newly established Duchy of Carinthia in 976, but separated together with the March of Carniola in 1040.

In the 12th century, Mitterburg Castle was in possession of the Lower Carniolan count Meinhard of Schwarzenburg, who held the office of a vogt of the Poreč bishops (in Latin documents he is known as &quot;Cernogradus&quot;), and established the Pazin County (earldom). Upon his death, Pazin was inherited by his son-in-law Count Engelbert III of Gorizia (Görz) in 1186.

While most of Istria had gradually been annexed by Venice, Engelbert&#x27;s descendant Count Albert III of Gorizia in 1374 bequested his Mitterburg estates to the Austrian House of Habsburg, who attached them to their Duchy of Carniola and gave it out in fief to various families, the last of which was the comital House of Montecuccoli from 1766.
Pazin and the surrounding areas were invaded multiple times by the Turks. These attacks intensified in the 1460s and 1470s. In 1463, Ivan Frankopan devastated Cerovlje and Zarečje before heading to the castle of Pazin. Eventually, however, he did not attack it, heading instead to the less protected Kašćerga and Sovinjak.

In 1476 the Turks struck the heartland of the towns of Pazin and Beram, with the people of Vermo later claiming to have captured and killed all the members of a band of Turkish raiders (&quot;akindjis&quot;). Both the Turks and the Venetians attacked the town of Draguccio (Draguć), in the &quot;Pisinese&quot;, and part of the County of Pazin since 1350, and destroyed the settlement around its castle during Austrian times. After the little town passed to Venice, the Uskoks and Austrians gave it the same treatment.

In 1501, the Turks encamped in the vicinity of Lindar. In the 19th century, the place where they encamped was still known as the &quot;Monte dei Turchi&quot; (&quot;Mount of the Turks&quot;). The last Ottoman incursion in Istria occurred in Pazin in 1511. On this occasion, they destroyed the castle.
In 1508, during the War of the League of Cambrai, the city was conquered by Venetian forces under Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano, and annexed by the Republic of Venice. It remained under Venetian rule until 1509. During its time under the &quot;Serenissima&quot;, Francesco Loredan was the castellan of the fortress, while Secondo de Cà Pesaro served in the position of captain of Pazin, as &quot;provveditore&quot; of the Republic of Venice.

Slavs inhabited the countryside around Pazin since the 9th century; they worked for the German landowners, who lived in the small fortresses and rocks, built on the edges of the cliffs. The Italians of Pisino trace their origins to the pre-existing Roman community living in the area of the County of Pazin, having resisted the expansion and assimilation of the newcomers. The Italian ethnicity in the County of Pazin was also kept alive and powered by the continuous contact and relationships with the nearby and strictly Italian communities of the Pola and Parenzo (Poreč) areas.

In the area surrounding Pazin, there is a very old presence of Croatized Romanians (Vlachs). They are recorded as early as 1102 in Moncalvo di Pisino. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Austrians brought to the County of Pazin many families of Morlachs, especially after the Treaty of Madrid, which ended the Uskok War.

As with the other Istrian counties, the notary and diplomatic language of Pazin remained Latin, in preference to the German language. The Istrian Demarcation (&quot;Razvod istarski&quot;) was written in 1325 in Croatian and in the Glagolitic script. Beside this debated document, there is only one document written in Croatian, a borders act between Kožljak and Mošćenička Draga, which, however, was written in Croatian to please to chieftains of the Mošćenička Draga area, subjects of the lords of Kastav, who didn&#x27;t understand Latin. The only official language of the public and private documents of the County of Pazin was Latin, which in the 17th century was replaced by the Italian language. Even the acts and the registers from the captain administration were written in Latin, and then in Italian; German, which was still marginally used up to the 16th century, was used ever less, and finally disappeared in the 17th century.

By 1500, the city of Pazin, with a population of around 1500 people, The head of the comune, and elected representative, did not bear the title of &quot;zupano&quot; (&quot;župan&quot;), but that of &quot;gastaldo&quot;. He was elected by the twelve counselors of the so-called &quot;Banca&quot;, and to operate needed the confirmation, or captain investment. His &quot;coadiutori&quot; (literally, coadjutors, collaborators) were usually called the &quot;giudici rettori&quot;. A public notary with Imperial authority acted as chancellor of the comune, stipulating its acts and contracts.
In 1890, through an artificial formation of the comune, the Austrian government was able to make the &quot;municipio&quot; fall to the Slavs, but the Italians &quot;passionately defended the city on this and other occasions&quot;. The Italians kept in Pazin the headquarters of the &quot;Società politica istriana&quot; (&quot;Istrian Political Society&quot;).

Until 1918, the town (under the name Pisino) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austrian side after the compromise of 1867), seat of the district of the same name, one of the 11 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in the Austrian Littoral province.

In the same year, Pazin and all the Peninsula of Istria were transferred to the Kingdom of Italy. Benito Mussolini, then, introduced a fascist regime in Italy which, under the &quot;Duce&quot;, began to Italianize the region. Most of Istria became part of Yugoslavia after World War II with the Treaty of Paris in 1947, and subsequently became part of modern-day Croatia.

==Education==
Public education was neglected until the 16th century, when some priests started to teach the basics of Latin to the children of the local nobles and the bourgeoisie. Thereafter, the Pazin comune started to hire an Italian tutor (&quot;precettore italiano&quot;), who had also to serve as the organist of the Church of San Nicolò. The young Pazin students who wanted to pursue their studies in the humanities or philosophy would then move to Trieste or Rijeka, where they would study in the local Jesuit colleges. Those who then wanted to continue with higher studies would often go to Padua.

Between 1646 and 1766, 73 youngsters from the County of Pazin attended the Jesuit college in Trieste, 41 of whom were from Pazin proper. The rector of the Jesuit college of Trieste, Giacomo Rampelli, was himself from Pazin.

In 1836, the first middle school in Pazin was opened. It operated until 1890 when it was moved to Pola (Pula). Teaching in the gymnasium of Pazin was only in the German language. In 1872, the Pazin deputy Francesco Costantini obtained, after long insistence, that also a lower gymnasium with the Italian language would be opened. Slavic parliamentarians of the Diet of Istria bought time until they received assurance that a Croatian gymnasium would also be opened. In 1899, by order of the Austrian government, the first Croatian gymnasium of Pazin was to be set up, which caused a &quot;manifestation of Italianness&quot; throughout the Julian March. There were manifestations throughout Istria and Trieste, which caused the diet to decree that also the Italian school would be opened in 1899.

The Italian Gymnasium of Pazin prospered, and its initial premises became too small. The &quot;consiglio comunale&quot; spotted a suitable area for the new building, but the then Austrian appointed podestà, a Croatian, opposed the purchase. The &quot;giunta provinciale&quot; intervened, voiding the decision of the podestà. The new school was opened in 1902, and before it was completed it was visited by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, who was surprised by the Italian population, writing to his friend Francesco Salata:

The Italian gymnasium suffered during World War I, being requisitioned from August 1914 to October of that year. Three of its professors were called to arms, one of whom died on the battlefield. The school was evicted in 1915 and had to resettle in a private house. There were then the first political persecutions, with the arrest of one student and his family and the internment in concentration camp of a professor. It was eventually closed down by the Austrian authorities in 1916. Thirty-tree students of the gymnasium voluntarily participated in the war, four of whom died on the battlefield, and one in prison. In 1918, after the Bersaglieri entered the city, works to reopen the school, now dilapidated, were started.
It was named after Gian Rinaldo Carli since 1919. The building was further enlarged in 1926 and ten years later the boarding school &quot;Fabio Filzi&quot; was completed. The school was attended by students from all over Istria, notably Luigi Dallapiccola, Biagio Marin, Pierantonio Quarantotti Gambini, Mario and Licio Visintini, and Dario Leaone, the youngest victim of the foibe massacres. It produced many students who fought for Italy in various wars. It was bombed during World War II, on 4 October 1943, and finally dismantled in 1946, with the demolition of the structure. Its rector Eros Luginbuhl was killed in Split by the partisans, while professor Teresita Bonicelli tragically disappeared. Teacher Norma Cossetto was tortured and infoibed in the foiba of Villa Surani; the principal of the school and rector of the boarding school, Vitale Berardinelli, and professor Antonio Natoli were killed by Yugoslav fleeing forces.

After the Germans reoccupied the city, lessons restarted in the boarding school, which was shared with the German soldiers. The latter eventually evicted the school, which was again relocated to a private house. After the Yugoslav partisans entered the city in May 1945, one of their first actions was evicting the school from that private house. It was then relocated to another house. Pazin was then in ruin, but it was decided to restart the school in the boarding school, which was now inhabited by the Croatian clerics, who opposed this. Thanks to the mediation of Italian bishop Santin, the school was successfully restarted there.

A sanitary commission then visited the school, evicting it again, and themselves leaving the building in deplorable condition when they departed. The Italians cleaned the school and lessons were restarted, but an exhibition of the Croatian civilization was organized there and the school had to be closed again. It was then moved to the infirmary in the back of the boarding school. The school was later allowed to move back to the previous room, where the students had to put up without heating in the winter. In February, the rector Stefani was arrested in his home, brought to Labin and then Opatija, where he miraculously managed to escape. The school was definitively closed in the summer of 1946.

==Sights==

The current town was mostly built beneath the medieval fortress. The present-day Pazin Castle was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th century and disassembled in the 18th and 19th. It has been a museum since the end of World War II.

The Pazin ponor (&quot;Pazinska jama/Foiba&quot;) located under the castle was partially explored by Édouard-Alfred Martel in 1896 and is the best example of karst hydrography and morphology in Istria. Castle and a gorge inspired Jules Verne for the novel &quot;Mathias Sandorf&quot; of 1885.

Pazin was also home to the Rapicio Castle, built in the 16th century. The Castle was bombed and badly damaged during World War II together with the Italian Gymnasium. Today, its ruins are still visible.

<text>The 5th Marine Battalion (Spanish &quot;Batallón de Infantería de Marina 5&quot;, abbreviated to BIM-5) is a battalion of the Argentine Marines.

==Current==
Today BIM-5, together with the 4th Marine Battalion (BIM-4), is based at Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego Province as part of the Argentine Navy&#x27;s &quot;Fuerza de Infantería de Marina Austral&quot; (Southern Marine Corps Force, FAIA), formerly &quot;Fuerza de Infantería de Marina N°1&quot; (First Marine Force, FIM1). They started the &quot;Black Beret&quot; tradition from a design made by Marine Sub-Lieutenant (naval rank equivalent to army Sub-Lieutenant) Abelardo &quot;Tigre&quot; (Tiger) Terré at the beginning of 1977, with the Marine Commander Manuel Tomé as its CO. After a Mountain and Cold Weather commando fighting course, they were dubbed the &quot;Aguilas Australes&quot; (Southern Eagles) and wore a black beret with a silver flash. Later on, the flash was changed to the unit&#x27;s crest, and the use of the beret spread throughout FIM1 and FAIA. The Original &quot;Aguilas Australes&quot; flash is currently the semi-official logo of the Rio Grande Marine Garrison (Agrupación IM Río Grande).

==History==

===Operation Soberanía===

At 20:00 on 22 December 1978 a task force of the Argentine Navy and the Argentine Marines ( Batallón N° 5 ) under the command of Humberto José Barbuzzi would seize the islands Horn, Freycinet, Hershell, Deceit, and Wollaston. On D-day, a severe storm impeded Argentine operations in the disputed area.

===Falklands War and Battle of Mount Tumbledown===
Commanded by Marine Commander Carlos H. Robacio, BIM-5 took part in the defence of Mount Tumbledown in the 1982 Falklands War. Although made up of conscripts, the unit&#x27;s core of highly-professional NCOs and commissioned officers, along with a well-developed training and logistics system, rendered BIM-5 a tough unit that fought well in defense during the Battle of Mount Tumbledown. Different Argentine authorities have repeatedly decorated BIM-5&#x27;s colors, with the French awarding Marine Admiral Robacio the French Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the Argentine government awarding him the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal.

Mount Tumbledown, Mount William, and Sapper Hill lie west of Stanley. They were held by BIM-5, a reinforced, cold weather trained and equipped, marine battalion. During preparations for movement to the Falklands, the Marine battalion was brought up to full strength of a light brigade with a company of the amphibious engineer company and a battery of the 1st Marine Artillery Regiment. The 5th Marines were further strengthened by three Tigercat SAM/Hispano-Suiza 35mm batteries of the 1st Marine Anti-Aircraft Regiment, deployed along Stanley harbor, and a heavy machine-gun company of the Headquarters Battalion.

The BIM-5 positions around Port Stanley were bombarded, both from the sea by naval gunfire and from the air by the Royal Air Force Harriers. On 1 May, Private Daniel Cabiglioli from M Company was killed during the Royal Navy bombardment of Sapper Hill. At 4.30 p.m., on 7 June 1982, a British Harrier bombing positions held by the 5th Marine Battalion was reportedly hit by concentrated fire from M Company (under Marine Sub-Lieutenant Rodolfo Cionchi) on Sapper Hill. According to Private José Luis Fazio:

There were no British aircraft lost on 7 June.

12 June proved to be the toughest day for the Argentine Marines. From the moment the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards had finally been moved to Goat Ridge by helicopter, 1,500 rounds of artillery, descended upon the Marines, in preparation for the coming infantry assault. At the same time 3 PARA on Mount Longdon came under heavy and accurate fire that killed four Paras and one REME craftsman and wounded seven Paratroopers in the shelling that was directed by Sub-Lieutenant Marcelo de Marco, the artillery officer of the 5th Marines on Tumbledown Mountain.

On 13 June a diversionary action was fought to the northeast to raid the Cortley Ridge fuel dump. The 101st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group&#x27;s B Battery (B/GADA101) was assigned to defend the Fresinet Peninsula, a long, narrow piece of land running from Moody Brook to form the northern arm of Stanley, when their troops came under attack at 11 p.m. The incursion was carried out by the SAS and SBS in four rigid raiders. They were engaged by Lieutenant Héctor Gazzolo&#x27;s platoon of Marines with automatic weapons, resulting in three British wounded and the loss of all the landing crafts involved as John Parker reveals in &quot;SBS: The Inside Story of The Special Boat Service&quot; (Hachette, 2013):

A six-man team from 3 SBS ... with D and G Squadrons, SAS, with the object of creating a diversionary assault from the sea ... were to move across the Murrell River by four fast power-boats ... The raiders had no option but to withdraw. One of the RRCs was badly damaged and limped back on hardly any power. The coxswain steered her by the hospital-ship for a shield and the boat died on them just as they reached the water&#x27;s edge. Another sank just offshore, but close enough for the team to swim to safety ... An SBS corporal and two SAS troopers were wounded ... The RRCs were riddled with holes and had to be destroyed.

Further south, the action was initiated shortly after 8 p.m., as the 2nd Scots Guards&#x27; Reconnaissance Platoon carried out a diversionary attack, advancing with four Blues and Royals Scorpion light tanks. As the British tanks came into range of the 5th Marine Battalion&#x27;s O Coy (O/BIM5), one of the Scorpion tanks was incapacitated by a booby-trap. In a firefight that lasted two hours, three Marines were killed (Marine Conscripts Omar Iniguez, Omar Patrone, and Juan Rava). Marine First Class Private José Luis Fazio fought against the British diversionary force:

At about 2230 hours our battalion had its first intensive gun battle with British companies which appeared out of nowhere. I heard Private Roberto Barboza yell &#x27;The English are here!&#x27; ... I remember our Operations Officer requested the artillery to assist at 23.00 with star shells. The close-quarter battle was such that the Argentine artillery was unable to drop shells onto the British attackers. I was shooting, doing my work. I don&#x27;t know if I killed anyone. We just fired our rifles, that&#x27;s all. Contact was maintained for over an hour before battalion headquarters ordered Obra Company to fall back ... What we did not realise at the time was that at least a wounded Marine made his way to the amphibious engineer platoon position and hurled a grenade wounding a Major. Simultaneously the Major opened fire, killing him. (Nick van der Bijl, Victory in the Falklands, p.199, Pen and Sword, 2007)

The Guards decided to fall back towards the south but entered a minefield and were caught in a crossfire from the Mortar Platoon under Sergeant Elbio Cuñe on Mount William and the Marines&#x27; artillery. BIM-5 coordinated fire support from &quot;Bravo&quot; Battery of the 1st Marine Field Artillery Battalion (B/BIAC) and also guns of the Argentine Army&#x27;s 3rd and 4th (Airborne) Artillery Groups (G.A.3/G.A.Aerot.4). The Guards sustained twelve casualties. At about 1.30 a.m. on 14 June, the commander of the 5th Marines ordered O Company of the Marines, to withdraw in order to stand in reserve. O Coy&#x27;s rest in reserve was short lived and in the early hours of 14 June the platoon commanders were instructed to put the platoons on one hour&#x27;s notice to move.

Meanwhile, to the north of Mount William, Marine Sub-Lieutenant Eduardo Villarraza&#x27;s N Company of the 5th Marines (N/BIM5) occupied Mount Tumbledown. At 10.30 p.m., they were attacked from Goat Ridge by 2nd Scots Guards. About 300 metres from the first Argentine position, the Marines opened fire with MAG machine-guns and FAL rifles. Both British forward platoons started to take casualties and the Scots Guards retreated to the western rocks and reorganized themselves. Argentine shells began landing among the Guards but by 2.30 a.m., part of the high ground was in British hands and the situation of the Argentine forces became uncertain. In the centre of the mountain, one Scots Guards platoon managed to secure a small piece of high ground, where they were able to set up a fire base that pinned down several Marine positions for the remaining five hours of the battle. Commander Robacio ordered Marine Sub-Lieutenant Eduardo Villarraza to send a fighting patrol to deal with the fire base. Marine Sub-Lieutenant Hector Miño with 5th Platoon accompanied by Second Lieutenant Augusto La Madrid (Argentine Army) with 3rd Platoon. Meanwhile, members of the Marine N Company (N/BIM5) were ordered to remain under cover during a bombardment by Argentine artillery. However, using the cover of British artillery, the Scots Guards advanced upon the Argentine positions. Marine Private Jorge Sanchez, in the book &quot;5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands&quot; (Leo Cooper, 2003), recalled:

The fighting was sporadic, but at times fierce, as we tried to maintain our position. By this time we had ten or twelve dead including one officer [Second Lieutenant Oscar Silva, Argentine Army]. I hadn&#x27;t fired directly at a British soldier, as they had been too hard to get a clear shot at. I can remember lying there with all this firing going over my head. They were everywhere. The platoon commander [Marine Sub-Lieutenant Carlos Daniel Vazquez] then called Private Ramon Rotela manning the 60 millimetre mortar and Rotela fired it straight up into the air so that the bombs landed on ourselves. At this point I had been up and in actual combat for over six hours. It was snowing and we were tired. Some of the guys had surrendered, but I didn&#x27;t want to do this. I had only twenty rounds left and I decided to continue the fight from Mount William. I popped up, fired a rifle grenade in the direction of 8 to 10 British soldiers to keep their heads down, and then ran for the 2nd Platoon. I can remember saying some type of prayer hoping the British wouldn&#x27;t shoot me in the back.

Two Argentine platoons (Second Lieutenant La Madrid and Marine Sub-Lieutenant Miño) on the eastern of Tumbledown counter-attacked resulting in further British casualties but were outmanoeuvred by the Scots Guards. During this action Miño was wounded but refused medical assistance until all the wounded men received medical attention.

The fall of Wireless Ridge and the heavy expenditure of artillery, mortar and machine-gun ammunition in support of the 7th Infantry Regiment (RI7) on the ridgeline overlooking Moody Brook rendered the situation of the Marines tenuous.

Using armour-infantry-co-operation the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment had advanced through the RI7 companies. O Company, BIM-5 (O/BIM5) had been sent up to the Moody Brook area and moved into blocking positions to the south and east of Moody Brook. In due course firing broke out in the direction of Battalion HQ at Moody Brook, indicating that the British had outflanked their position. At 7 a.m., the Commanding Officer of the 5th Marines reported his command post near Moody Brook had come under enemy fire from Wireless Ridge. By dawn the approach of the Gurkhas, advancing to secure Mount William was detected.

As the Marine commanders on Tumbledown and Mount William awaited reinforcements, they received orders to withdraw. Ignoring these orders, the Marines continued to resist. By 9 a.m., the Marines had again been ordered to withdraw. Around eight RI 6 personnel were killed and eighteen captured, many of them wounded but the 5th Marine Battalion&#x27;s N Coy (N/BIM5) on Tumbledown and William carried out an orderly withdrawal to Sapper Hill. The 6th Regiment&#x27;s B Coy (B/RI6) also successfully withdrew with its portable weapons to set up new defensive positions around Sapper Hill. Five of the Marine platoon positions now fell to the British. Lt.-Col. Morgan&#x27;s 1st Battalion of the 7th Gurkhas took Mount William unopposed and his men were bitterly disappointed.

By 10.a.m. the 5th Marine Battalion&#x27;s position had stabilized. The Argentine commanding officer, Marine Commander Robacio and the RI 6 Officer involved, Major Jaimet were determined to continue fighting. In the battle report Marine Commander Robacio wrote:

I was convinced that we could still resist, and that is why I ordered the O Company - which was ready - to begin a counter-attack together with the M Company. I planned to direct this attack myself personally. (Marine Rear Admiral Carlos Büsser, El BIM 5 en las Malvinas, Boletin del Centro Naval, pp. 318–319).

Generals Mario Benjamin Menendez (the commander of the Argentine garrison) and Oscar Jofre (commander of the 10th Brigade, responsible for the defence of Stanley), following a quick conference, agreed that to continue resistance would entail senseless loss of life. By 1 p.m., the 5th Marines had initiated their withdrawal, after destroying their vehicles and heavy equipment. Minutes later Marine Midshipman (naval rank equivalent to second lieutenant) Alejandro Koch&#x27;s 3rd Platoon, M Coy (M/BIM5) covering the withdrawal of the Marine battalion were attacked by C Company of 40 Commando (C/40 Cdo.) landing from Sea King helicopters. (Hugh Bicheno &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; pg. 314)

Three Argentine Marines (Marine Conscripts Roberto Leyes, Eleodoro Monzon and Sergio Robledo) from Koch&#x27;s platoon were killed covering the last withdrawal. Marine Midshipman Marcelo Davis&#x27;s 1st Platoon from M/BIM 5 attempted a counterattack but were beaten back.

Two Sea Kings sustained extensive small arms damage but remained operational. Two Royal Marine Commandos were shot in the action. Two more Royal Marines, 2nd Lt. Paul Allen and Marine Wayne McGregor, trod on mines and Major Brian Armitage was badly injured when a Volvo BV-202 tracked vehicle ran over an anti-tank mine planted in the Sapper Hill sector. &quot;We ran over a mine. I went up through the roof and the vehicle went up and was turned right round by the explosion,&quot; recalled Major Armitage.

Marine Commander Robacio, commanding the Marine battalion, spoke to British journalists after the war and said:

At about seven o&#x27;clock I received the order to withdraw prior to a surrender. Our military code states that for an Argentine military unit to surrender it must have spent all its ammunition or lost at least two-thirds of its men. It was awful to have to ask the units which were still fighting to withdraw.

<doc id="539758" wikidata="Q682733" url="?curid=539758" title="The Castle (novel)">
<text>The Castle (, also spelled &quot;Das Schloß&quot; ) is the last novel by Franz Kafka, first published in 1926. In it a protagonist known only as &quot;K.&quot; arrives in a village and struggles to gain access to the mysterious authorities who govern it from a castle supposedly owned by &quot;Graf&quot; Westwest. 

Kafka died before he could finish the work and the novel was posthumously published against his wishes. Dark and at times surreal, &quot;The Castle&quot; is often understood to be about alienation, unresponsive bureaucracy, the frustration of trying to conduct business with non-transparent, seemingly arbitrary controlling systems, and the futile pursuit of an unobtainable goal.

== History ==

Kafka began writing the novel on the evening of 27 January 1922, the day he arrived at the mountain resort of (now in the Czech Republic). A picture taken of him upon his arrival shows him by a horse-drawn sleigh in the snow in a setting reminiscent of &quot;The Castle&quot;. Hence, the significance that the first few chapters of the manuscript were written in the first person and at some point later changed by Kafka to a third-person narrator, &quot;K.&quot;

=== Max Brod ===

Kafka died before he could finish the novel, and it is questionable whether he intended to finish it if he had survived his tuberculosis. At one point he told his friend Max Brod that the novel would conclude with K., the book&#x27;s protagonist, continuing to reside in the village until his death; the castle would notify him on his deathbed that his &quot;legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was permitted to live and work there.&quot; However, on 11 September 1922 in a letter to Brod, he wrote he was giving up on the book and would never return to it. As it is, the book ends mid-sentence.

Although Brod was instructed by Kafka to destroy all of his unpublished works on his death, Brod instead set about publishing many of them. &quot;&quot; was originally published in German in 1926 by the publisher Joella Goodman of Munich. This edition sold far less than the 1,500 copies that were printed. It was republished in 1935 by Schocken Verlag in Berlin, and in 1946 by Schocken Books of New York.

Brod heavily edited the work to ready it for publication. His goal was to gain acceptance of the work and the author, not to maintain the structure of Kafka&#x27;s writing. This would play heavily in the future of the translations and continues to be the center of discussion on the text. Brod donated the manuscript to Oxford University.

Brod placed a strong religious significance on the symbolism of the castle. This is one possible interpretation of the work based on numerous Judeo-Christian references as noted by many including Arnold Heidsieck.

=== Malcolm Pasley ===

The publisher soon realized the translations were &quot;bad&quot; and in 1940 desired a &quot;completely different approach&quot;. In 1961 Malcolm Pasley got access to all of Kafka&#x27;s works except &quot;The Trial&quot;, and deposited them in Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library. Pasley and a team of scholars (Gerhard Neumann, Jost Schillemeit, and Jürgen Born) started publishing the works in 1982 through S. Fischer Verlag. &quot;&quot; was published that year as a two-volume set — the novel in the first volume, and the fragments, deletions, and editor&#x27;s notes in a second volume. This team restored the original German text to its full and incomplete state, including Kafka&#x27;s unique punctuation, considered critical to the style.

=== Stroemfeld/Roter Stern ===

Interpretations of Kafka&#x27;s intent for the manuscript are ongoing. At one time Stroemfeld/Roter Stern Verlag did work for the rights to publish a critical edition with manuscript and transcription side-by-side. But they met with resistance from the Kafka heirs and Pasley.

=== Major editions ===

== Title ==
The title &#x27; may be translated as &quot;the castle&quot; or &quot;the palace&quot;, but the German word is a polyseme that can also mean &quot;the lock&quot;. It is also phonetically close to &#x27; (&quot;conclusion&quot; or &quot;end&quot;). The castle is locked and closed to K. and the townspeople; neither can gain access.

The castle does not look like a castle. Anthea Bell&#x27;s translation states that it was &quot;an extensive complex of buildings, a few of them with two storeys, but many of them lower and crowded close together. If you hadn&#x27;t known it was a castle you might have taken it for a small town&quot; (p. 11).

== Plot ==
The protagonist, K., arrives in a village governed by a mysterious bureaucracy operating in a nearby castle. When seeking shelter at the town inn, he claims to be a land surveyor summoned by the castle authorities. He is quickly notified that his castle contact is an official named Klamm, who, in an introductory note, informs K. he will report to the Mayor.

The Mayor informs K. that through a mix-up in communication between the castle and the village, he was erroneously requested. But the Mayor offers him a position as a caretaker in service of the school teacher. Meanwhile, K., unfamiliar with the customs, bureaucracy and processes of the village, continues to attempt to reach Klamm, which is considered a strong taboo to the villagers.

The villagers hold the officials and the castle in high regard, even though they do not appear to know what the officials do. The actions of the officials are never explained. The villagers provide assumptions and justification for the officials&#x27; actions through lengthy monologues. Everyone appears to have an explanation for the officials&#x27; actions, but they often contradict themselves and there is no attempt to hide the ambiguity. Instead, villagers praise it as another action or feature of an official.

One of the more obvious contradictions between the &quot;official word&quot; and the village conception is the dissertation by the secretary Erlanger on Frieda&#x27;s required return to service as a barmaid. K. is the only villager who knows that the request is being forced by the castle (even though Frieda may be the genesis), with no consideration of the inhabitants of the village.

The castle is the ultimate bureaucracy with copious paperwork that the bureaucracy maintains is &quot;flawless&quot;. But the flawlessness is a lie; it is a flaw in the paperwork that has brought K. to the village. There are other failures of the system: K. witnesses a servant destroying paperwork when he cannot determine who the recipient should be.

The castle&#x27;s occupants appear to be all adult men, and there is little reference to the castle other than to its bureaucratic functions. The two notable exceptions are a fire brigade and that Otto Brunswick&#x27;s wife declares herself to be from the castle. The latter declaration builds the importance of Hans, Otto&#x27;s son, in K.&#x27;s eyes as a way to gain access to the castle officials.

The officials have one or more secretaries that do their work in their village. Although they sometimes come to the village, they do not interact with the villagers unless they need female companionship, implied to be sexual in nature.

== Characters ==
Note: The Muir translations refer to the Herrenhof Inn where the Harman translations translate to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Inn&quot; (while the Bell translation calls it the &quot;Castle Inn&quot;). Below, all references to the inn where the officials stay in the village is the Herrenhof Inn since this was the first, and possibly most widely read, translation.

== Major themes ==
=== Theology ===

It is well-documented that Brod&#x27;s original construction was based on religious themes and this was furthered by the Muirs in their translations. But it has not ended with the Critical Editions. Numerous interpretations have been made with a variety of theological angles.

One interpretation of K.&#x27;s struggle to contact the castle is that it represents a man&#x27;s search for salvation. According to Mark Harman, translator of a 1998 edition of &quot;The Castle&quot;, this was the interpretation favored by the original translators Willa Muir (helped by Edwin), who produced the first English volume in 1930. Harman feels he has removed the bias in the translations toward this view, but many still feel this is the point of the book.

Fueling the biblical interpretations of the novel are the various names and situations. For example, the official Galater (the German word for Galatians), one of the initial regions to develop a strong Christian following from the work of Apostle Paul and his assistant Barnabas. The name of the messenger, Barnabas, for the same reason. Even the Critical Editions naming of the beginning chapter, &quot;Arrival&quot;, among other things liken K. to an Old Testament messiah.

=== Bureaucracy ===

The obvious thread throughout &quot;The Castle&quot; is bureaucracy. The extreme degree is nearly comical and the village residents&#x27; justifications of it are amazing. Hence it is no surprise that many feel that the work is a direct result of the political situation of the era in which it was written, which was shot through with anti-Semitism, remnants of the Habsburg monarchy, etc.

But even in these analyses, the veiled references to more sensitive issues are pointed out. For instance, the treatment of the Barnabas family, with their requirement to first prove guilt before they could request a pardon from it and the way their fellow villagers desert them have been pointed out as a direct reference to the anti-Semitic climate at the time.

In a review of the novel in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, William Burrows disputes the view that &quot;The Castle&quot; deals with bureaucracy, claiming that this view trivializes Kafka&#x27;s literary and artistic vision, and is &quot;reductive&quot;. He claims, instead, that the book is about solitude, pain, and the desire for companionship.

== Allusions to other works ==
Critics often talk of &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot; in concert, highlighting the struggle of the protagonist against a bureaucratic system and standing before the law&#x27;s door unable to enter as in the parable of the priest in &quot;The Trial&quot;.

In spite of motifs common with other works of Kafka, &quot;The Castle&quot; is quite different from &quot;The Trial&quot;. While K., the protagonist of &quot;The Castle&quot;, faces similar uncertainty and difficulty in grasping the reality that suddenly surrounds him, Josef K., the protagonist of &quot;The Trial&quot;, seems more experienced and emotionally stronger. But while Josef K.&#x27;s surroundings stay familiar even when strange events befall him, K. finds himself in a new world whose laws and rules are unfamiliar to him.

== Publication history ==

In 1926 Brod persuaded Kurt Wolff to publish the first German edition of &quot;The Castle&quot; in his publishing house. Due to its unfinished nature and his desire to get Kafka&#x27;s work published, Max Brod took some editorial freedom.

In 2022 &quot;The Castle&quot; entered the public domain.

=== Muir translation ===
In 1930 Willa and Edwin Muir translated the First German edition of &quot;The Castle&quot; as it was compiled by Max Brod. It was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in England and Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. The 1941 edition, with a homage by Thomas Mann, was the one that fed the post-war Kafka craze.

In 1954 the &quot;definitive&quot; edition was published and included additional sections Brod had added to the Schocken Definitive German edition. The new sections were translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser. Some edits were made in the Muir text namely the changes were &quot;Town Council&quot; to &quot;Village Council&quot;, &quot;Superintendent&quot; to &quot;Mayor&quot;, &quot;Clients&quot; to &quot;Applicants&quot;.

The 1992 edition of the Muirs&#x27; translation, in Alfred A. Knopf&#x27;s Everyman&#x27;s Library, contains a preface by Irving Howe.

The Muirs&#x27; translations use words that some consider &quot;spiritual&quot; in nature. For example, the Muirs translate the description of a church tower in K.&#x27;s homeland, which K. compares with the castle, as &quot;soaring unfalteringly&quot;, where Harman, p. 8, uses &quot;tapering decisively&quot;, Underwood, p. 9, writes, &quot;tapering straight upward&quot;, and Bell, p. 11, writes &quot;tapering into a spire&quot;. Furthermore, the Muirs use &quot;illusory&quot; from the opening paragraph forward. Some critics note this as further evidence of their bias toward a mystical interpretation.

=== Harman translation ===
In 1961 Malcolm Pasley was able to gain control of the manuscript, along with most of the other Kafka writings (save &quot;The Trial&quot;) and had it placed in the Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian library. There, Pasley headed a team of scholars and recompiled Kafka&#x27;s works into the Critical Edition. &quot;The Castle&quot; Critical Edition, in German, consists of two volumes—the novel in one volume and the fragments, deletions and editor&#x27;s notes in a second volume. They were published by S. Fischer Verlag in 1982, hence occasionally referred to as the &quot;Fischer Editions&quot;.

Mark Harman used the first volume of this set to create the 1998 edition of &quot;The Castle&quot;, often referred to as based on the &quot;Restored Text&quot; or the &quot;English Critical Edition&quot;. Unlike the Muir translation, the fragments, deletions, and editor&#x27;s notes are not included. According to the publisher&#x27;s note:

We decided to omit the variants and passages deleted by Kafka that are included in Pasley&#x27;s second volume, even though variants can indeed shed light on the genesis of literary texts. The chief objective of this new edition, which is intended for the general public, is to present the text in a form that is as close as possible to the state in which the author left the manuscript.

Harman&#x27;s translation has been generally accepted as being technically accurate and true to the original German. He has, however, received criticism for at times not creating the prosaic form of Kafka.

Harman includes an eleven-page discussion on his philosophy behind the translation. This section provides significant information about the method he used and his thought process. There are numerous examples of passages from Pasley&#x27;s, Muir&#x27;s, and his translation to provide the reader with a better feel for the work. Some feel that his (and the publisher&#x27;s) praise for his work and his &quot;patronizing&quot; of the Muirs goes a little too far. J. M. Coetzee writes that Harman says that his translation is &quot;stranger and denser&quot; than the Muirs&#x27;. But, Coetzee adds, &quot;in its very striving toward strangeness and denseness [Harman&#x27;s] own work—welcome though it is today—may, as history moves on and tastes change, be pointing toward obsolescence too&quot;.

<text>ARA &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; (&quot;Most Holy Trinity&quot;) is a Type 42 destroyer of the Argentine Navy, the only one of her class built outside Britain. She participated in the 1982 Falklands War. In January 2013 the ship capsized and sank at her moorings in the Argentine naval base of Puerto Belgrano due to lack of maintenance, being refloated in December 2015. The navy&#x27;s plan to turn her into a museum ship was not realised and, in 2020, the Argentine president stated that the ship should be scrapped, though this was later blocked by federal courts.

==Construction and trials==
The destroyer was built at the Argentine AFNE Río Santiago shipyard, supported by engineers and technicians from the UK, and commissioned in October 1980.

===Sabotage===
Construction began in 1973, but commissioning was long delayed by an improvised limpet mine attack carried out by divers of the guerrilla organization Montoneros on 22 August 1975. The date was chosen as a retaliation for the Trelew massacre three years before, when a number of leftist militants, most of them from the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ERP), were executed inside Almirante Zar air base, operated by the navy. The raid was allegedly planned in imitation of Operation Frankton, a British commando attack against German shipping in Bordeaux during World War II. The attack involved the use of a folding boat, frogmen and a limpet mine with of explosives, which was laid on the river bed below the destroyer after a failed attempt to attach the device to the hull. The ship&#x27;s bottom and electronics suffered severe damage, and completion was suspended for a year as a result of the attack.

===Commissioning===
The Argentine Navy enhanced the offensive capabilities of their Type 42s by fitting MM-38 Exocet missiles. The boat decks of the original design were replaced by special decks to install the missiles around the funnel, but the launchers were apparently never mounted on &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. In April 1981 she made her maiden voyage to Britain, where the destroyer carried out her first sea trials, and her crew was trained in the operation and launching of Sea Dart missiles. She returned to Argentina in December 1981 having successfully completed all training and trials.

==Operational history==

===Falklands War===

====Argentine Landings====
&quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was the leading ship of the Argentine landings on the Falklands on 2 April 1982. Both the navy and the army commanders of the operation were on board. A team of 84 amphibious commandos and 8 tactical divers landed at Mullet Creek at midnight in 21 Gemini boats lowered from her deck. The wireless message demanding the surrender of the British Governor, Rex Hunt (governor), along with the Royal Marines detachment on the islands was also radioed from the destroyer.

====Sea Harrier incident====
During the remainder of the Falklands War, along with her sister ship , the unit served as the main escort to the aircraft carrier . At first &quot;Hércules&quot; operated independently along with a group of older destroyers, but the development of mechanical problems in her sister ship forced the Argentine commander to merge the two Type 42 destroyers into one escorting force. The carrier naval group was known as &quot;Grupo de Tareas 79.1&quot; (Task Force 79.1), and was intended to search for and engage its British counterpart from waters north of the Falklands. &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was responsible for the command and control of the group&#x27;s air defence.

Late on 1 May, the carrier launched a number of S-2 Tracker surveillance aircraft, with the aim of finding the British Task Group. One of the Tracker&#x27;s crews radioed that they were being chased by an unknown jet while returning to &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;. Shortly after midnight, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was ordered to switch her Type 965 radar on and track the unidentified contact. She then locked onto a Sea Harrier with her Type 909 fire-control radar, followed afterwards by her sister-ship &quot;Hércules&quot;. The British aircraft, Sea Harrier XZ451 piloted by Flight Lieutenant Ian Mortimer of 801 Naval Air Squadron, retreated because of the threat of the Sea Dart, but not before spotting the area of deployment of the Argentine fleet. After realising that the enemy was not engaged in a major amphibious operation as supposed, which made any attempt of the Argentine against the British carriers extremely dangerous, the Argentine commander, Admiral Allara, decided to withdraw his forces to shallow waters close to the coast.

====Coastal surveillance====

The destroyer lost her Lynx helicopter on 4 May when the aircraft hit her flight-deck as the Argentine fleet was redeploying. She spent the next few days in dry dock to repair the mechanical problems which reduced her speed during the operations of 1 May. In the following weeks, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was engaged in patrol duties off Patagonia. During the Air Force attacks on Bluff Cove on 8 June, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; played a key role by jamming the frequencies used by the Sea Harriers air controllers with interference signals. Once the end of hostilities was declared, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; escorted the British transport into Puerto Madryn with about 3,000 Argentine prisoners on board.

===After the war===
After the war the British weapons and supplies embargo on Argentina made the purchase of spare parts impossible. The Argentine Minister of Defence considered selling the destroyers, and as a consequence, the Navy placed &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; in reserve as a parts supplier for &quot;Hércules&quot;. From 2 to 15 March 1987 she took part in Operation &quot;Grifo&quot;, the Argentine response to Operation &quot;Fire-Focus&quot;, the largest British military exercise around the Falklands since 1982. Her last Sea Dart missile test launch was conducted on 27 November 1987 against an Argentine-built drone. &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;″s last voyage took place in 1989.

==Fate==
Since 2004, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was listed as &quot;in reserve awaiting overhaul&quot;, but it was expected that the navy would formally decommission her. There were projects in the Argentine congress calling for &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; to be converted into a museum ship.

On 21 January 2013, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; suffered a broken valve which resulted in the flooding of several compartments. The flooding was beyond the capacity of the pumps and the crew was evacuated. The ship took on a 50-degree list and then sank at her berth in Puerto Belgrano. &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was in poor condition before she sank; the ship had been cannibalized to keep her sister &quot;Hércules&quot; operational, as the British refused to sell spare parts to Argentina after the Falklands War. In September 2014, specialists of the Argentine navy began an operation to raise the ship. In December 2015, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was refloated and the Navy announced their plan to turn her into a museum dedicated to the 1982 war. This project seemed to have been discarded by 2018. The Argentine president decreed on 17 December 2020 that the ship should be placed out of use and disposed of.

In December 2021, an Argentine federal court ruled that the ship cannot be scrapped due to her historical significance and can qualify for status as a national historic site.

<text>Postcolonial feminism is a form of feminism that developed as a response to feminism focusing solely on the experiences of women in Western cultures and former colonies. Postcolonial feminism seeks to account for the way that racism and the long-lasting political, economic, and cultural effects of colonialism affect non-white, non-Western women in the postcolonial world. Postcolonial feminism originated in the 1980s as a critique of feminist theorists in developed countries pointing out the universalizing tendencies of mainstream feminist ideas and argues that women living in non-Western countries are misrepresented.

Postcolonial feminism argues that by using the term &quot;woman&quot; as a universal group, women are then only defined by their gender and not by social class, race, ethnicity, or sexual preference. Postcolonial feminists also work to incorporate the ideas of indigenous and other Third World feminist movements into mainstream Western feminism. Third World feminism stems from the idea that feminism in Third World countries is not imported from the First World, but originates from internal ideologies and socio-cultural factors.

Postcolonial feminism is sometimes criticized by mainstream feminism, which argues that postcolonial feminism weakens the wider feminist movement by dividing it. It is also often criticized for its Western bias.

==History==
The history of modern feminist movements can be divided into three waves. When first-wave feminism originated in the late nineteenth century, it arose as a movement among white, middle-class women in the global North who were reasonably able to access both resources and education. Thus, the first wave of feminism almost exclusively addressed the issues of these women who were relatively well off. The first-wavers focused on absolute rights such as suffrage and overturning other barriers to legal gender equality. This population did not include the realities of women of color who felt the force of racial oppression or economically disadvantaged women who were forced out of the home and into blue-collar jobs. However, first-wave feminism did succeed in getting votes for women and also, in certain countries, changing laws relating to divorce and care and maintenance of children.

Second-wave feminism began in the early 1960s and inspired women to look at the sexist power struggles that existed within their personal lives and broadened the conversation to include issues within the workplace, issues of sexuality, family, and reproductive rights. It scored remarkable victories relating to Equal Pay and the removal of gender based discriminatory practices. First and second-wave feminist theory failed to account for differences between women in terms of race and class—it only addressed the needs and issues of white, Western women who started the movement. Postcolonial feminism emerged as part of the third wave of feminism, which began in the 1980s, in tandem with many other racially focused feminist movements in order to reflect the diverse nature of each woman&#x27;s lived experience. Audre Lorde contributed to the creation of Postcolonial Feminism with her 1984 essay &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot;. Chandra Talpade Mohanty&#x27;s essay &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; also came out in 1984, analyzing the homogenizing western feminist depiction of the &quot;third world woman.&quot; These works, along with many others, were foundational to the formation of postcolonial feminism.

Many of the first key theorists of postcolonial feminism hail from India and were inspired by their direct experiences with the effects that colonization had left in their society. When colonizers came to India, an importance that was not as prevalent before was placed on gender. Many women lost power and economic autonomy as men gained much more of it, and this had a lasting effect even after India gained independence

In efforts to move away from grand narratives stemmed from globalization, postcolonial theory was formed as a scholarly critique of colonial literature. By acknowledging the differences among diverse groups of women, postcolonial feminism addresses what some call the oversimplification of Western feminism as solely a resistance against sexist oppression. Postcolonial feminism, in contrast, also relates gender issues to other spheres of influence within society.

==Theory==
Postcolonial feminism is a relatively new stream of thought, developing primarily out of the work of the postcolonial theorists who concern themselves with evaluating how different colonial and imperial relations throughout the nineteenth century have impacted the way particular cultures view themselves. This particular strain of feminism promotes a wider viewpoint of the complex layers of oppression that exist within any given society.

Postcolonial feminism began simply as a critique of both Western feminism and postcolonial theory, but later became a burgeoning method of analysis to address key issues within both fields. Unlike mainstream postcolonial theory, which focuses on the lingering impacts that colonialism has had on the current economic and political institutions of countries, postcolonial feminist theorists are interested in analyzing why postcolonial theory fails to address issues of gender. Postcolonial feminism also seeks to illuminate the tendency of Western feminist thought to apply its claims to women around the world because the scope of feminist theory is limited. In this way, postcolonial feminism attempts to account for perceived weaknesses within both postcolonial theory and within Western feminism. The concept of colonization occupies many different spaces within postcolonial feminist theory; it can refer to the literal act of acquiring lands or to forms of social, discursive, political, and economic enslavement in a society.

In Audre Lorde&#x27;s foundational essay, &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot;, Lorde uses the metaphor of &quot;the master&#x27;s tools&quot; and &quot;the master&#x27;s house&quot; to explain that western feminism is failing to make positive change for third world women by using the same tools used by the patriarchy to oppress women. Lorde found that western feminist literature denied differences between women and discouraged embracing them. The differences between women, Lorde asserts, should be used as strengths to create a community in which women use their different strengths to support each other.

Chandra Talpade Mohanty, a principal theorist within the movement, addresses this issue in her seminal essay &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot;. In this essay, Mohanty asserts that Western feminists write about Third World women as a composite, singular construction that is arbitrary and limiting. She states that these women are depicted in writings as victims of masculine control and of traditional culture without incorporating information about historical context and cultural differences with the Third World. This creates a dynamic where Western feminism functions as the norm against which the situation in the developing world is evaluated. Mohanty&#x27;s primary initiative is to allow Third World women to have agency and voice within the feminist realm.

In the article &quot;Third World Women and the Inadequacies of Western Feminism&quot;, Ethel Crowley, sociology professor at Trinity College of Dublin, writes about how western feminism is lacking when applied to non-western societies. She accuses western feminists of theoretical reductionism when it comes to Third World women. Her major problem with western feminism is that it spends too much time in ideological &quot;nit-picking&quot; instead of formulating strategies to redress the highlighted problems. The most prominent point that Crowley makes in her article is that ethnography can be essential to problem solving, and that freedom does not mean the same thing to all the women of the world.

==Relationship to Western feminisms==
Postcolonial feminism began as a criticism of the failure of Western feminism to cope with the complexity of postcolonial feminist issues as represented in Third World feminist movements. Postcolonial feminists seek to incorporate the struggle of women in the global South into the wider feminist movement. Western feminists and feminists outside of the West also often differ in terms of race and religion, which is not acknowledged in Western feminism and can cause other differences. Western feminism tends to ignore or deny these differences, which discursively forces Third World women to exist within the world of Western women and their oppression to be ranked on an ethnocentric Western scale.

Postcolonial feminists do not agree that women are a universal group and reject the idea of a global sisterhood. Thus, the examination of what truly binds women together is necessary in order to understand the goals of the feminist movements and the similarities and differences in the struggles of women worldwide. The aim of the postcolonial feminist critique to traditional Western feminism is to strive to understand the simultaneous engagement in more than one distinct but intertwined emancipatory battle.

This is significant because feminist discourses are critical and liberatory in intent and are not thereby exempt from inscription in their internal power relations. The hope of postcolonial feminists is that the wider feminist movement will incorporate these vast arrays of theories which are aimed at reaching a cultural perspective beyond the Western world by acknowledging the individual experiences of women around the world. Ali Suki highlights the lack of representation of women of color in feminist scholarship comparing the weight of whiteness similar to the weight of masculinities. This issue is not due to a shortage of scholarly work in the global South but a lack of recognition and circulation. This reinforces Western hegemony and supports the claim of outweighed representation of white, Western scholars. Most available feminist literature regarding the global South tends to be written by Western theorists resulting in the whitewashing of histories.

Feminist postcolonial theorists are not always unified in their reactions to postcolonial theory and Western feminism, but as a whole, these theorists have significantly weakened the bounds of mainstream feminism. The intent of postcolonial feminism is to reduce homogenizing language coupled with an overall strategy to incorporate all women into the theoretical milieu. While efforts are made to eliminate the idea of the Third World &quot;other&quot;, a Western Eurocentric feminist framework often presents the &quot;other&quot; as victim to their culture and traditions. Brina Bose highlights the ongoing process of &quot;alienation and alliance&quot; from other theorists in regards to postcolonial feminism; she emphasizes, &quot;...the obvious danger both in &#x27;speaking for&#x27; the silent/silenced as well as in searching for retaliatory power in elusive connections...&quot; There is a tendency throughout many different academic fields and policy strategies to use Western models of societies as a framework for the rest of the world. This critique is supported in other scholarly work including that of Sushmita Chatterjee who describes the complications of adding feminism as a &quot;Western ideological construct to save brown women from their inherently oppressive cultural patriarchy.&quot;

==Relationship to postcolonial theory==
The postcolonial feminist movements look at the gendered history of colonialism and how that continues to affect the status of women today. In the 1940s and 1950s, after the formation of the United Nations, former colonies were monitored by the West for what was considered social progress. The definition of social progress was tied to adherence to Western socio-cultural norms. The status of women in the developing world has been monitored by organizations such as the United Nations. As a result, traditional practices and roles taken up by women, sometimes seen as distasteful by Western standards, could be considered a form of rebellion against colonial rule. Some examples of this include women wearing headscarves or female genital mutilation. These practices are generally looked down upon by Western women, but are seen as legitimate cultural practices in many parts of the world fully supported by practicing women. Thus, the imposition of Western cultural norms may desire to improve the status of women but has the potential to lead to conflict.

In order to understand the postcolonial feminist theory, one must first understand the postcolonial theory. In sociology, postcolonial theory is a theory that is preoccupied with understanding and examining the social impacts of European colonialism, its main claim is that the modern world as it is now is impossible to understand without understanding its relation with and history of imperialism and colonial rule. Postcolonialism can provide an outlet for citizens to discuss various experiences from the colonial period. These can include: &quot;migration, slavery, oppression, resistance, representation, difference, race, gender, place and responses to the influential discourses of imperial Europe.&quot; Ania Loomba critiques the terminology of &#x27;postcolonial&#x27; by arguing the fact that &#x27;post&#x27; implicitly implies the aftermath of colonization; she poses the question, &quot;when exactly then, does the &#x27;postcolonial&#x27; begin?&quot; Postcolonial feminists see the parallels between recently decolonized nations and the state of women within patriarchy taking &quot;perspective of a socially marginalized subgroup in their relationship to the dominant culture.&quot; In this way feminism and postcolonialism can be seen as having a similar goal in giving a voice to those that were voiceless in the traditional dominant social order. While this holds significant value aiding new theory and debate to arise, there is no single story of global histories and Western imperialism is still significant. Loomba suggests that colonialism carries both an inside and outside force in the evolution of a country concluding &#x27;postcolonial&#x27; to be loaded with contradictions.

==Race and religion==

Postcolonial feminism has strong ties with indigenous movements and wider postcolonial theory. It is also closely affiliated with black feminism because both black feminists and postcolonial feminists argue that mainstream Western feminism fails to adequately account for racial differences. Racism has a major role to play in the discussion of postcolonial feminism. Postcolonial feminists seek to tackle the ethnic conflict and racism that still exist and aims to bring these issues into feminist discourse. In the past, mainstream Western feminism has largely avoided the issue of race, relegating it to a secondary issue behind patriarchy and somewhat separate from feminism. Until more recent discourse, race was not seen as an issue that white women needed to address.

In her article &quot;Age, Race, Class and Sex: Women Redefining Difference&quot;, Lorde succinctly explained that, &quot;as white women ignore their built-in privilege and define &quot;woman&quot; in terms of their own experiences alone, then women of Color become &#x27;other&#x27;...&quot; which prevents the literary work produced by women of color from being represented in mainstream feminism.

Postcolonial feminism attempts to avoid speaking as if women were a homogeneous population with no differences in race, sexual preference, class, or even age. The notion of whiteness, or lack thereof, is a key issue within the postcolonial feminist movement. This is primarily due to the perceived relationship between postcolonial feminism and other racially based feminist movements, especially Black feminism and indigenous feminisms. In Western culture, racism is sometimes viewed as an institutionalized, ingrained facet of society. Postcolonial feminists want to force feminist theory to address how individual people can acknowledge racist presumptions, practices, and prejudices within their own lives attempting to halt its perpetuation through awareness.

Vera C. Mackie describes the history of feminist rights and women&#x27;s activism in Japan from the late nineteenth century to present day. Women in Japan began questioning their place in the social class system and began questioning their roles as subjects under the Emperor. The book goes into detail about iconic Japanese women who stood out against gender oppression, including documents from Japanese feminists themselves. Japan&#x27;s oppression of women is written about displaying that women from yet another culture do not live under the same circumstances as women from western/white cultures. There are different social conducts that occur in Asian countries that may seem oppressive to white feminists; according to Third World feminist ideologies, it is ideal to respect the culture that these women are living in while also implementing the same belief that they should not be oppressed or seen in any sort of sexist light. Chilla Bulbeck discusses how feminism strives to fight for equality of the sexes through equal pay, equal opportunity, reproductive rights, and education. She also goes on to write about how these rights apply to women in the global South as well but that depending on their country and culture, each individual&#x27;s experience and needs are unique.

&quot;False consciousness&quot; is perpetuated throughout mainstream feminism assuming that people in the global South don&#x27;t know what is best for them. Postcolonial framework attempts to shed light on these women as &quot;full moral agents&quot; who willingly uphold their cultural practices as a resistance to Western imperialism. For example, representation of the Middle East and Islam focuses on the traditional practice of veiling as a way of oppressing women. While Westerners may view the practice in this way, many women of the Middle East disagree and cannot understand how Western standards of oversexualized dress offer women liberation. Such Eurocentric claims have been referred to by some as imperial feminism.

==Colonial and postcolonial race influence==
The U.S., where Western culture flourishes most, has a majority white population of 77.4% as of the 2014 U.S. census. They have also been the majority of the population since the 16th century. Whites have had their role in the colonialism of the country since their ancestors settlement of Plymouth Colony in 1620. Although they ruled majority of the U.S. since their settlement, it was only the men who did the colonizing. The women were not allowed to have the same freedoms and rights that men had at the time. It was not until the victory of World War I that the Roaring Twenties emerged and gave women a chance to fight for independence. It is also the reason that first-wave feminist were able to protest. Their first major accomplishment was the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. Some of the women that led the first-wave feminist movement were Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Anthony, Stanton, and many other feminist fought for the equality of rights for both women and African Americans; however, their accomplishments only benefited white middle-class women. The majority of equality achieved through first and second wave feminism and other movements still benefits mainly the white population. The lack of acknowledgement and acceptance of white privilege by white people is a main contributor to the inequality of rights in the United States. In the book &quot;Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines&quot;, Stephanie M. Wildman states, &quot;The notion of privilege... has not been recognized in legal language and doctrine. This failure to acknowledge privilege, to make it visible in legal doctrine, creates a serious gap in legal reasoning, rendering law unable to address issues of systemic unfairness.&quot; White privilege, oppression, and exploitation in the U.S. and Western influenced countries are main contributors to the formation of other feminist and philosophical movements such as black feminism, Islamic feminism, Latinx philosophy, and many other movements.

==Relationship to Third World feminism==
Depending on feminist literature, Third World and postcolonial feminism can often be used interchangeably. In a review upon other scholars work of the two terms, Nancy A. Naples highlights the differences; &quot;Third World&quot; nations, termed as such by North America and Europe, were characterized as underdeveloped and poor resulting in a dependency of &quot;First World&quot; nations for survival. This term started being widely used in the 1980s but shortly after began to receive criticism from postcolonial scholarship. Naples defines the term &#x27;postcolonial&#x27; as, &quot;...typically applied to nations like India where a former colonial power has been removed.&quot; Both terms can be argued as problematic due to the reinforced idea of &quot;othering&quot; those from non-Western culture.

Though postcolonial feminism was supposed to represent the evolution of Third World into a more reformed ideology, Ranjoo Seodu Herr argues for Third World Feminism to be reclaimed highlighting the importance of the local/national,&quot;...in order to promote inclusive and democratic feminisms that accommodate diverse and multiple feminist perspectives of Third World women on the ground.&quot;

The term is also in relation with other strands of feminism, such as Black feminism and African feminism.

== Double colonization ==
Double colonization is a term referring to the status of women in the postcolonial world. Postcolonial and feminist theorists state that women are oppressed by both patriarchy and the colonial power, and that this is an ongoing process in many countries even after they achieved independence. Thus, women are colonized in a twofold way by imperialism and male dominance.

Postcolonial feminists are still concerned with identifying and revealing the specific effects double colonization has on female writers and how double colonization is represented and referred to in literature. However, there is an ongoing discussion among theorists about whether the patriarchal or the colonial aspect are more pressing and which topic should be addressed more intensively.

The concept of double colonization is particularly significant when referring to colonial and postcolonial women&#x27;s writing. It was first introduced in 1986 by Kirsten Holst Petersen and Anna Rutherford in their anthology &quot;A Double Colonization: Colonial and Postcolonial Women&#x27;s Writing&quot;, which deals with the question of female visibility and the struggles of female writers in a primarily male&#x27;s world. As Aritha van Herk, a Canadian writer and editor, puts it in her essay &quot;A Gentle Circumcision&quot;: &quot;Try being female and living in the kingdom of the male virgin; try being female and writing in the kingdom of the male virgin.&quot;
Writers that are usually identified with the topic of double colonization and critique on Western feminism are for example Hazel V. Carby and Chandra Talpade Mohanty. &quot;White Woman Listen!&quot;, an essay composed by Carby, harshly critiques Western feminists who she accuses of being prejudiced and oppressors of black women rather than supporters. In this context she also talks about &quot;triple&quot; oppression: &quot;The fact that black women are subject to the simultaneous oppression of patriarchy, class and &quot;race&quot; is the prime reason for not employing parallels that render their position and experience not only marginal but also invisible&quot;.

Mohanty&#x27;s argument in &quot;Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses&quot; goes into the same direction. She blames Western feminists of presenting women of color as one entity and failing to account for diverse experiences.

== Postcolonial feminist literature ==
With the continued rise of global debt, labor, and environmental crises, the precarious position of women (especially in the global south) has become a prevalent concern of postcolonial feminist literature. Other themes include the impact of mass migration to metropolitan urban centers, economic terrorism, and how to decolonize the imagination from the multiple binds of writing as a woman of color. Pivotal novels include Nawal El Saadawi&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the Iman&quot; about the lynching of women, Chimamanda Adichie&#x27;s &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; about two sisters in pre and post war Nigeria, and Giannina Braschi&#x27;s &quot;United States of Banana&quot; about Puerto Rican independence. Other major works of postcolonial feminist literature include novels by Maryse Condé, Fatou Diome, and Marie Ndiaye, poetry by Cherríe Moraga, Giannina Braschi, and Sandra Cisneros, and the autobiography of Audre Lorde (&quot;&quot;).

Maria Lugones’ “Toward a Decolonial Feminism” is another piece of postcolonial feminist literature that explores gender norms in relation to the Indigenous people of the United States and the oppression that came with Christianity and the bourgeoisie.

==Critiques==
As postcolonial feminism is itself a critique of Western feminism, criticism of postcolonial feminism is often understood as a push back from Western feminism in defense of its aims. One way in which the Western feminist movement criticizes postcolonial feminism is on the grounds that breaking down women into smaller groups to address the unique qualities and diversity of each individual causes the entire movement of feminism to lose purpose and power. This criticism claims that postcolonial feminism is divisive, arguing that the overall feminist movement will be stronger if women can present a united front.

Like Western feminism, postcolonial feminism and Third World feminism are also in danger of being ethnocentric, limited by only addressing what is going on in their own culture at the expense of other parts of the world. Colonialism also embodies many different meanings for people and has occurred across the world with different timelines. Chatterjee supports the argument that postcolonial perspective repels &quot;Holistic perspectives of the grand narrative of enlightenment, industrial revolution, and rationality render &#x27;other&#x27; histories and people invisible under hegemonic constructions of truth and normalcy.&quot; Generalizing colonialism can be extremely problematic as it translates into postcolonial feminism due to the contextual &#x27;when, what, where, which, whose, and how&#x27; Suki Ali mentions in determining the postcolonial.

Sara Suleri is a common critic of postcolonial feminism, in her work “Woman Skin Deep: Feminism and the Postcolonial Condition” she questions whether the language used in feminism and ethnicity were not so similar, if racial identity and feminism would be connected or “so radically inseparable” from each other. She also states that postcolonial feminism is “not matched with any logical or theoretical consistency” because it reduces sexuality to “the literal structure of the racial body” which is not consistent with postcolonial feminism&#x27;s stance on the removal of oppressive labels and categorization.

While postcolonial discourse has brought significant expansion of knowledge regarding feminist work, scholars have begun to rework and critique the field of postcolonial feminism developing a more well-rounded discourse termed transnational feminism. Where postcolonial theory highlighted representation and the &quot;othering&quot; of experience of those in the global South, transnational feminism aids in understanding &quot;new global realities resulting from migrations and the creation of transnational communities.&quot;

Postcolonial feminism is also criticized for the implications behind its name. The term &quot;postcolonial&quot;, consisting of the prefix &quot;post-&quot; and suffix &quot;colonial&quot;, insinuates that the countries it is referring to have left the era of colonialism and are progressing from it. This way of thinking promotes the idea that all developing countries underwent colonizing and began the process of decolonizing at the same time when countries referred to as &quot;postcolonial&quot; have actually endured colonization for different time frames. Some of the countries that are called &quot;postcolonial&quot; can in fact still be considered colonial. Another issue with the term &quot;postcolonial&quot; is that it implies a linear progression of the countries it addresses, which starkly contrasts the goal of postcolonial theory and postcolonial feminism to move away from a presentist narrative.

<doc id="539766" wikidata="Q288205" url="?curid=539766" title="Two Whatevers">
<text>The &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; () refers to the statement that &quot;We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave&quot; ().

This statement was contained in a joint editorial, entitled &quot;Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link&quot;, printed on 7 February 1977 in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, the journal &quot;Red Flag&quot; and the &quot;PLA Daily&quot;.

== History ==
The policy was advocated by the Chinese Communist Party chairman Hua Guofeng, Mao&#x27;s successor, who had earlier ended the Cultural Revolution and arrested the Gang of Four. However, this policy proved unpopular with Deng Xiaoping and other party leaders advocating market reform.

On a 7 February 1977 editorial titled &quot;Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link&quot; which appeared in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, &quot;Red Flag&quot;, and &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army Daily&quot;, Hua articulated the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; slogan: &quot;We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave&quot;.

It proved a trigger for Deng&#x27;s manoeuvre in 1978 to implement economic reform policy in China, and eventually led to Hua being demoted from the party leadership in 1980. Even before he was fully rehabilitated, Deng described the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; as being contrary to the essence of Marxism. On 11 May 1978, &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; published a front-page editorial criticizing the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot;. In June 1978, Deng endorsed the perspective of the editorial at an All-Army Political Work Conference. Deng stated that Marxist theory should not be &quot;lifeless dogma&quot; and cited Mao&#x27;s method of seeking truth from facts, contrasting the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; with the view that &quot;only through practice can the correctness of one&#x27;s ideas be proved, and there is no other way of testing truth.&quot;

The coalition of Hua&#x27;s political supporters, referred to as the &quot;whateverist faction&quot;, also lost its power after Deng&#x27;s political manoeuvre: Wang Dongxing, Ji Dengkui, Wu De, and Chen Xilian, the so-called &quot;Little Gang of Four&quot;, were relieved of all their Party and state posts during the 5th Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the CCP, 23–29 February 1980.

<doc id="539775" wikidata="Q117078" url="?curid=539775" title="Power forward (ice hockey)">
<text>In ice hockey, power forward (PWF) is a loosely applied characterization of a forward who is big and strong, equally capable of playing physically or scoring goals and would most likely have high totals in both points and penalties. It is usually used in reference to a forward who is physically large, with the toughness to dig the puck out of the corners, possesses offensive instincts, has mobility, puck-handling skills, may be difficult to knock off the puck or to push away from the front of the goal and willingly engage in fights when he feels it is required. Possessing both physical size and offensive ability, power forwards are also often referred to as the &#x27;complete&#x27; hockey player.

Historically, &quot;power forward&quot; was not originally a hockey term, finding comparatively recent origins from basketball. Harry Sinden, former president of the Boston Bruins, claims &quot;power forward&quot; first became part of hockey terminology because of the style of play of Cam Neely, an NHL player from 1983 to 1996, who could play ruggedly and also score goals.

Punch Broadbent was one of the first players who pioneered the style before the NHL was founded in 1917, while Charlie Conacher, Phil Esposito, Gordie Howe, Maurice Richard and Bert Olmstead are likewise considered quintessential examples of power forwards in the decades before the term entered hockey vernacular.

<text>Boy on a Stick and Slither (sometimes abbreviated as BOASAS) is a webcomic by Steven L. Cloud. Strips usually feature a short, pithy and sometimes surreal exchange between the title characters. The strip is characterized by dry and cynical humor.

==History==
&quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot; was first uploaded in 1999 and was originally a member of webcomics collective Dumbrella. Though &quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot; primarily exists on the web, it has also been published in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; and in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. In April 2007, the webcomic was picked up by United Media, which syndicated the webcomic online at Comics.com until February 2009. &quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot; has since been hosted on its own website.

==Style==
Tym Godek of &quot;The Webcomics Examiner&quot; described &quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot; as with saying &quot;Nothing in BOASAS stands still. Jittering characters, constantly shifting backgrounds and frequent non-sequiturs proliferate through the webcomic.&quot; Cloud&#x27;s day job in online marketing is apparent in the strip&#x27;s design, as &quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot; looks very cognizant of color and layout. Michael Whitney of &quot;Comixtalk&quot; prompted that &quot;aesthetically, the strip smacks of commercial art: full page ads and catalog layouts.&quot; Cloud breaks the mold in composition, frequently experimenting with backgrounds and panel layouts. Cloud noted in an interview that color is very important to him, and he described picking colors for any given strip as &quot;probably my favorite thing to do.&quot; For print publications, Cloud draws alternate black-and-white versions of his strips.

==Characters==
Steven Cloud conceptualized the titular &quot;Boy on a Stick&quot; as he was doodling a boy&#x27;s head one day and didn&#x27;t want to mess it up with a poorly-drawn body. He drew a simple rectangular shape below the neck, and to his surprise, the design worked out fairly well. He gave him Slither as a friend, because Cloud found snakes to be exceedingly simple to draw. Cloud wanted his characters to become iconic and easily recognizable, like the characters in &quot;Peanuts&quot;. The Boy on a Stick gradually developed a highly optimistic personality, while Slither became a pessimistic character: Cloud said of the Boy on a Stick and Slither that &quot;the characters allow me to debate myself. They&#x27;re the best and worst of me.&quot; Godek of &quot;The Webcomics Examiner&quot; described Boy on a Stick as &quot;the voice of innocence and possibility&quot; who is paired with Slither, &quot;the voice of cynicism and negation.&quot; However, Godek also described both characters is inherently nihilistic, though the Boy in a more cheerful manner. Whitney of &quot;Comixtalk&quot;, meanwhile, described the two characters as &quot;icons or stand-ins for any two people.&quot;

Other characters in &quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot; play a very minor role, and were primarily created when Cloud was low on ideas. Two characters, the &quot;Florida Cracker&quot; and &quot;Frickles Mudcat&quot;, helped Cloud present political topics during the 2004 presidential election.

<text>Invisible Monsters is a novel by American writer Chuck Palahniuk, published in 1999. It is his third novel to be published, though it was his second written novel (after &quot;Insomnia: If You Lived Here, You&#x27;d Be Home Already&quot;). The novel was originally supposed to be Palahniuk&#x27;s first novel to be published, but it was rejected by the publisher for being too disturbing. After the success of his novel &quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot; was given a second chance, and a revised version of it was published. The first edition was released in paperback in 1999, and on June 11, 2012, it was published in hardcover, in a revised edition titled &quot;Invisible Monsters Remix&quot; ().

==Plot==
The narrator of the story, Shannon McFarland, is a disfigured former model who goes by multiple pseudonyms, notably Daisy St. Patience and Bubba Joan—identities given to her by Brandy Alexander. The novel opens &quot;in medias res&quot; on the wedding day of Evie Cottrell, whose house is burning to the ground. Brandy, who has been shot by Evie, asks the narrator to tell her life story. Her memories of her life and her relationship with Brandy are told in a non-linear sequence.

The narrator is the daughter of a farmer. Her older brother, Shane, was kicked out of the house for being gay after contracting gonorrhea. After their parents receive a phone call from a stranger that Shane is dead from AIDS, they become obsessive supporters of gay rights, so that even in death, Shane gets more parental attention than the narrator. This attention is a large source of resentment for the narrator towards her brother, and she sought a career in modeling in attempt to get attention for herself.

The narrator&#x27;s best friend in modeling school is Evelyn &quot;Evie&quot; Cottrell, who begins a secret relationship with the narrator&#x27;s boyfriend, Manus Kelley, a police officer. While driving down the highway, the narrator is mysteriously shot in the face and her jaw is torn off. She immediately drives to the hospital and recovers, but her lower jaw is lost; she keeps her disfigured face veiled and her modeling career has been destroyed. In group speech therapy she meets Brandy Alexander, a trans woman. During sessions, Brandy instructs the narrator in how to give herself a new life and a new identity, and gives her a new name, Daisy St. Patience, the first among many new identities.

Evie begs the narrator to come live with her but leaves for Cancún as soon as she arrives, leaving the narrator alone. The first night, Manus breaks into the house with a knife. Because of the rapid non-linear motion of the novel&#x27;s events, the narrator has often referred to Manus as &quot;Seth&quot;, an identity given to him by Brandy, and it is not until this moment in the novel that it becomes clear that Manus and Seth are the same person. When Manus and Evie&#x27;s affair is exposed, both claim that the other shot the narrator. The narrator sets fire to Evie&#x27;s house and overpowers and then forces Manus to ingest pills before locking him in the trunk of his own car. 

The narrator flees to the hotel room where Brandy lives. She meets Brandy&#x27;s roommates, the Rhea sisters, a trio of drag queens who are paying for Brandy&#x27;s sex change operations. The narrator learns that Brandy is actually Shane, who strives to look like her sister (the narrator) through surgery. Brandy is unaware of the narrator&#x27;s true identity and wants to find her sister. Brandy, the narrator, and Manus leave to travel the country. They frequently pretend to be wealthy clients to view expensive homes that are for sale and steal whatever drugs they can find, alternately ingesting or selling them. Later, the narrator learns of Brandy&#x27;s stories of sexual abuse by police officer Manus as a teenager, leading to Shane&#x27;s contracting gonorrhea, being assumed to be gay, and being kicked out. &quot;Brandy&quot; divulges that she is not actually transgender—Shane, not wanting to be himself after what he endured, has chosen to become a woman because he sees it as a way to disfigure himself and lose any sense of identity to become beyond the control of others.

One day the trio is viewing a home and realize that the realtor is Evie&#x27;s mother, who reveals that Evie herself transitioned at a young age and that her parents are marrying her off to save themselves trouble. The trio attend the wedding. The narrator sets fire to Evie&#x27;s house, thus returning to the opening scene of the novel.

It is revealed that Brandy originally met Evie in a transgender support group, in which Evie told Brandy of the narrator&#x27;s accident. Brandy reveals she has always known that the narrator was her sister, Shannon McFarland. In turn, Shannon reveals that she shot &quot;herself&quot; in the face to escape from being beautiful and beholden to her career and relationships, mirroring Shane&#x27;s decision to transition.

Later, at Brandy&#x27;s side while she recovers in a hospital, Shannon determines that she has never truly loved anyone except her brother. Leaving her pocket book with all of her identification, she tells a sleeping Brandy that since Shane is still confused about what he wants out of life, he can have the only thing she has left, her identity as Shannon McFarland. The novel ends with Shannon leaving the hospital and into the world to find a new start.

In the Remix version, it is revealed that Shannon, now going by Daisy St. Patience full-time, has established a cemetery after her parents have died, in which people can buy plots for relatives they disliked with spiteful sayings carved into the tombstones. She also creates a group for disfigured women called &quot;Elephant Women&quot;. In the end, she marries an unidentified man.

==Characters==
* Shannon McFarland, The Narrator and former fashion model, now disfigured by a mysterious gunshot injury. She goes by many various names throughout the book, most notably Daisy St. Patience and Bubba-Joan.
* Brandy Alexander, Queen Supreme, aka Princess Princess—A transgender woman whom the narrator meets in the hospital shortly after her own mysterious gunshot injury. Brandy encourages Narrator to hide her disfigurement and attempt to live a new lifestyle. 
* Manus Kelley—Narrator&#x27;s ex-fiancé, an ex-police officer. He goes by many different names throughout the book.
* Evelyn &quot;Evie&quot; Cottrell—Narrator&#x27;s former best friend, also a fashion model.
* The Rhea Sisters—Three male drag queens who Brandy describes as being family. They dote on her and pay for all of her surgeries.

==&quot;Invisible Monsters Remix&quot;==
Originally released in paperback in 1999, the first hardcover edition of &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot; was published on June 11, 2012. This edition is a restructured version of the novel, entitled &quot;Invisible Monsters Remix&quot;. It contains a new author&#x27;s introduction, explaining that the linear structure of the first edition was not the novel&#x27;s original intent. Instead, this new edition of the novel presents the chapters in mixed order with instructions on which chapter to read next, and new chapters have also been added.

==Film adaptation==
MacLaren Productions Inc. acquired rights to the novel in 2009 and planned to begin production of a film adaptation in Vancouver in spring 2011 but this never materialised. The company established a website to help raise support where people can demand the book be made into a movie by submitting their email, name and location online. A Facebook group was also set up under the name &quot;Invisible Monsters Film&quot; to raise awareness for the film and generate support.

==References in popular culture==

Jeffree Star&#x27;s song title &quot;Your Heart is My Piñata&quot; is a direct reference to the Katty Kathy quote of the Rhea sister&#x27;s invention, with Jeffree&#x27;s debut album &quot;Beauty Killer&quot; containing several references to the novel.

Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s song &quot;Time to Dance&quot; heavily references the novel.

Motion City Soundtrack has a bonus track on their album &quot;Commit This to Memory&quot; titled &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot;, in direct reference to the novel.

<text>CHCH-DT (channel 11) is an independent television station in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Owned by Channel Zero, the station maintains studios on Innovation Drive in the west end of Hamilton; prior to 2021, it was located near the corner of Jackson and Caroline streets in downtown Hamilton for nearly 65 years. The station has additional offices at the Marriott on the Falls in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Its old transmitter was located on First Road West in the former city of Stoney Creek; it was demolished in March 2024 and replaced with a new transmitter located on Highway 5 near Millgrove Side Road in Dundas, Ontario, which started transmitting in November 2023.

CHCH signed on the air on June 7, 1954, as a CBC affiliate which was founded by Ken Soble. Beginning in 1961, it became an independent station which transformed into a national superstation on January 1, 1982. In 1990, the station was acquired by Western International Communications.

After several years as an independent station, CHCH was acquired by Canwest in 2000 and became the flagship station for the CH programming service as sister to the flagship CIII-TV of the Global Television Network. In 2007, the CH stations were rebranded to E! after an American cable network of the same name. When Canwest had financial problems, CHCH as well as Montreal&#x27;s CJNT-TV was acquired by independent broadcaster Channel Zero in 2009. It changed its format to an all-news and all-movies station. In 2010, the station again began to air U.S. prime time programming.

== History ==
=== CBC affiliation (1954–1961) ===
The station signed on the air on June 7, 1954, operating as an affiliate of CBC Television. Its studios at 163 Jackson Street West were previously used by CJSH-FM (102.9, now CKLH-FM). After CJSH&#x27;s shutdown, its studios were converted for CHCH. It is the oldest privately owned television station in the Hamilton–Toronto area. At the time all privately owned television stations in Canada were required to be CBC affiliates. CHCH-TV was founded by Ken Soble, a leader of Hamilton&#x27;s urban renewal movement and the owner of radio station CHML (900 AM).

=== Independent station (1961–1982) ===

In 1961, CHCH left the CBC and became an independent station. There were three reasons for removing its affiliation from CBC. Hamilton is part of the Toronto market, and Toronto-based CBLT already provided full network service to some of CHCH&#x27;s viewing area. CBLT planned to increase its transmitter power and change frequencies (from VHF channel 9 to channel 6, and eventually channel 5), resulting in a near-100 percent overlap with CHCH. The station&#x27;s managers wanted to produce more local programming, instead of having to carry CBC programming.

CHCH became the first and for over a decade the only television station in Canada not to be affiliated with any network; the other private stations (which signed on the air in 1960 or early 1961) that were not affiliated with the CBC had formed the CTV network in October 1961.

=== Possible flagship of a third network (1966–1981) ===
In the mid-1960s, CHCH was the lead station in United Program Purchase, a consortium of Canadian television stations which began purchasing some programming rights separately from the CTV and CBC networks.

By 1966, UPP was attracting media coverage as the potential framework for a third Canadian television network. In the fall of the same year, Soble&#x27;s Niagara Television which was the licensee of CHCH, put forward a proposal for a network to be branded as NTV. In the original plan, CHCH would have been the network&#x27;s flagship station for the Greater Toronto Area. However the application faced numerous regulatory hurdles and delays, and its main financial backer which was Power Corporation of Canada, backed out in 1969. By 1970 however, the network application was revived by former CHCH executive Al Bruner&#x27;s new Global Communications corporation, with Niagara Television and CHCH no longer involved in the bid. The Global Television Network network launched in 1974 on the new CKGN-TV.

Despite the station&#x27;s lack of success in developing a full-fledged network, it became one of Canada&#x27;s most prominent syndicators of non-network programming in the 1970s and 1980s, with many of its locally produced entertainment programs airing on television stations across Canada and occasionally internationally.

=== Superstation CHCH (1982–1997) ===

CHCH became a national superstation on January 1, 1982, when Cancom (now Shaw Broadcast Services) began carrying the station and three others (CHAN-TV in Vancouver, CITV-TV in Edmonton, and TCTV, which was essentially a rebroadcaster of CFTM-TV in Montreal) to cable television providers in remote regions of the country that otherwise only had access to the CBC.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the station began a branding effort centred around the slogan &quot;Together, we&#x27;re the ones!&quot; Different promotional slogans referring to either Hamilton or Ontario as a whole, reflecting the station&#x27;s cable coverage across the province, and a blue-coloured, 3D variation of the longtime &quot;circles&quot; logo were used. Promos had a vocal song from Frank Gari which was part of the &quot;Pride Inside&quot; music package also used by the station&#x27;s newscasts and movie presentations (originally commissioned by another channel 11 which is WBAL-TV in Baltimore).

=== ONtv era (1997–2001) ===

In 1990, Western International Communications (WIC) purchased CHCH. Although the station had been available on cable television in many Ontario markets for years, its broadcast signal coverage was expanded throughout Ontario in 1997. The launch of several rebroadcasters happened in 1997 in an effort to compete with the reach of Global&#x27;s Ontario station CIII (channel 6), and with the Baton Broadcast System, a group of mostly CTV-affiliated stations that served most of the province.

In turn WIC rebranded the station as &quot;ONtv&quot; (&quot;Ontario Television&quot;), in line with the branding conventions of many of the company&#x27;s other stations including CHAN-TV in Vancouver (which was branded as &quot;BCTV&quot;), CITV-TV in Edmonton (which was branded as &quot;ITV&quot;), and CHCA-TV in Red Deer, Alberta (which was branded as &quot;RDTV&quot;).

Local news programming shifted their focus from the station&#x27;s core market, the Hamilton area, toward Ontario as a whole in an attempt to challenge what was then a regional news service provided by Global. However, with Hamilton now being largely an afterthought and other local stations (in Toronto and elsewhere) already having strong ratings, the shift was unsuccessful and CHCH&#x27;s ratings decreased. During the ONtv years, the station also aired WIC&#x27;s nightly &quot;Canada Tonight&quot; newscast.

=== Canwest ownership (2001–2009) ===

In 2000, Canwest Global Communications purchased WIC&#x27;s television assets. Since Global already served the Hamilton area through flagship station CIII-TV&#x27;s transmitter in Paris, Ontario, Canwest rebranded the station &quot;CH&quot; (or &quot;CH Hamilton&quot;) on February 12, 2001, and launched the CH television system in September of that year. The move launched a secondary television system for Canwest&#x27;s stations in medium-sized cities located near larger markets. Local news coverage was revamped and refocused on the Hamilton/Halton/Niagara region.
Despite the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)&#x27;s television station ownership restrictions (one station per owner and per language in each market), Canwest was permitted to maintain CHCH&#x27;s coverage of other markets throughout most of Ontario. However it could not broadcast to Thunder Bay, Peterborough, or Kingston because of opposition from local television stations. Some cable providers outside of Ontario also continue to carry CHCH as a form of &quot;superstation&quot;. Its over-the-air signal also easily covers Buffalo, New York, and Erie, Pennsylvania, across the Canada–United States border.

On June 7, 2004, at 8 p.m. CHCH-TV celebrated its 50th anniversary. The station aired a documentary profiling the station&#x27;s history, entitled &quot;The First 50 Years: A Half Century of CH&quot;, which was hosted by Matt Hayes. It was announced that the CH brand would change starting in 2007; however, it remained in use until September 7, 2007. Canwest then rebranded CHCH&#x27;s local programming from CH Hamilton to &quot;CHCH News&quot; following the relaunch of the national CH service as E! under a brand licensing agreement with the E! cable channel in the United States. CHCH&#x27;s non-news schedule was rebranded on the same day as &quot;E! Ontario&quot;.
=== Channel Zero ownership (2009–present) ===
On February 5, 2009, Canwest announced it would explore &quot;strategic options&quot;. These included the possible sale or closure of CHCH and the company&#x27;s other stations in the E! system, saying a second conventional TV network was no longer key to the long-term success of the company. A grassroots group which was fronted by &quot;Live @ 5:30&quot; co-host Donna Skelly announced an intent to purchase CHCH from Canwest and return the station to its former local focus.

In March 2009, paperwork filed with the CRTC for a one-year renewal of CHCH&#x27;s licence revealed that the station was projected to lose nearly $30 million during the station&#x27;s 2010 fiscal year which began on September 1, 2009—with projected revenues of just $41 million against costs of $69 million. John Douglas, a spokesperson for Canwest, said that CHCH and its other stations in the E! group were money losers during the last decade, coupled with the Canadian broadcasters&#x27; dependency on American programming for profits.
On June 30, 2009, Channel Zero announced that it would purchase CHCH and CJNT-TV in Montreal from Canwest in exchange for $12 in cash and the assumption of various station liabilities. The CRTC approved the sale on August 28, 2009. Channel Zero took control of the station&#x27;s programming at midnight Eastern Time on the morning of August 31, beginning its tenure with a film from the 1980s. CHCH removed its affiliation from E! (which shut down at the end of the day) and adopted a new programming format. This consisted of local newscasts throughout the day on weekdays and movies at night (as well as all day on weekends, outside of limited newscasts, infomercials, and other select programs during the morning and evening hours). The channel reverted to branding itself as &quot;CHCH&quot;. 

The first film which was broadcast in prime time that night was &quot;Rocky&quot; as a signal to the new ownership&#x27;s come-from-behind spirit. CHCH added a modicum of additional programming during the 2009–10 season, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, a mixed martial arts program; Ed the Sock&#x27;s &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot;, a movie show featuring the former MuchMusic character alongside co-host Liana Kerzner and comedian Ron Sparks; and infomercials.

In September 2010, CHCH, for the first time since its purchase by Channel Zero, began airing American network television series. Many of the programs which were added, including &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;48 Hours Mystery&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;Chuck&quot;, and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; had been broadcast in the Toronto-Hamilton market on CKXT-TV (channel 52; the station&#x27;s owner, Quebecor, was in the process of replacing it with the all-news cable channel Sun News Network). CHCH also debuted additional original local programs &quot;Sportsline&quot; (hosted by Mark Hebscher and Clint &quot;Bubba&quot; O&#x27;Neil), and launched a second series with Ed the Sock, the entertainment newsmagazine spoof &quot;I Hate Hollywood&quot;. Coinciding with the schedule changes was the introduction of an updated version of CHCH&#x27;s classic multi-coloured logo used from the 1960s to the 1980s.
On April 10, 2011 Green Party leader Elizabeth May participated in a panel interview on CHCH. She was invited to attend the show as were the leaders of the Bloc Québécois, Liberals, New Democratic Party, and Conservatives, by Channel Zero, whose president was disappointed by May&#x27;s exclusion from the 2011 election leaders&#x27; debates.

On April 18, 2011, CKXT-TV converted from an independent station to a simulcast of the Sun News Network, leaving CHCH as the only independent station in the Toronto/Hamilton area (the station ceased operations approximately seven months later on November 1, 2011). On June 8, 2011, at Channel Zero&#x27;s upfront presentation for advertisers for the 2011–12 television season, the company announced a programming distribution deal with 20th Century Fox, giving CHCH and CJNT access to show first-run exclusive broadcast movie premieres, most notably &quot;Avatar&quot;, which first aired in May 2012 on both stations, featuring the director&#x27;s cut version of the film not shown in theatres. Other debut titles included &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;, &quot;Taken&quot;, and &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;.

During a broadcast of &quot;News Now AM&quot; on April 20, 2012, Cogeco&#x27;s and Shaw Cable&#x27;s transmissions of CHCH&#x27;s signal were interrupted for approximately three minutes by the broadcast of a scene from a hardcore gay pornography film from an unidentified adult-oriented specialty channel. The substitution appeared to have been made by a cable operator during repairs of severed cable lines, and not at CHCH, leaving the station&#x27;s over-the-air viewers and subscribers of other cable and satellite providers unaffected. Channel Zero denied that the program in question came from any of its adult-oriented Category B specialty channels (Maleflixxx Television, XXX TV and AOV TV). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission later announced it would be investigating the incident as a cable transmission issue.

In September 2012, CHCH acquired the rights to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; from CBC Television, after the network&#x27;s exclusive contract to carry both game shows expired. The shows were dropped for the fall 2014 season and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; began airing on Friday nights.

=== 2015 news department bankruptcy and aftermath (2015–present) ===
On December 11, 2015, CHCH cancelled that evening&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast amid fears the station was facing a shutdown. Though the station remained on the air, CHCH&#x27;s daytime rolling news format was discontinued at 4 p.m.; Channel Zero CEO Romen Podzyhun appeared on the air to announce that the station&#x27;s local newscasts would remain off the air through the weekend, and would return on December 14. In addition, Channel Zero announced that Channel 11, L.P., the subsidiary that had produced CHCH&#x27;s newscasts since 2009, had filed for bankruptcy. Podzyhun blamed it on a loss of federal subsidy and an inability to draw national advertising revenue to a locally oriented station, but stated that the station itself was not shutting down. 

CHCH&#x27;s news output would be scaled back to what it determined to be its &quot;core news programs&quot;, only producing hours of newscasts a week (a morning show and 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts, with no weekend news), after having produced 80 weekly hours of news before the cutbacks; the local news is mainly being maintained to meet the station&#x27;s licence requirements. A few programs from Bloomberg Television such as &quot;Studio 1.0, Good Fortunes&quot; and &quot;The Daily Brief&quot; were added to the station&#x27;s schedule the following week. Coincidentally CHCH&#x27;s former program &quot;The Morning Market&quot; used resources from Bloomberg twenty years before CHCH shared common ownership with Bloomberg TV Canada. The news graphics that had been used for morning and daytime news programming were kept intact for Morning Live and daytime programming produced by Channel Zero and Bloomberg TV Canada such as &quot;The Pinkertons&quot; and &quot;The Daily Brief.&quot;

In 2015, CHCH-DT teamed up with fellow independent CJON-DT and the three Yes TV stations (including nearby station CITS-DT) to share and syndicate YesTV&#x27;s secular programming in arrangement referred to in advertising sales information as the Net5 alliance (referring to the three O&amp;Os and two affiliates). Since Fall 2016, CHCH has replaced many airings of these programs with newly acquired daytime shows on weekdays, and movies on the weekends. Net5 was rebranded as indieNET following the addition of two other independent stations.

In the spring of 2016, Channel Zero put the studios of CHCH-DT (from which the station has continuously operated, starting in 1954) on the market. The studios include the historic stone mansion &quot;Pinehurst&quot; (built in 1850 by local politician Tristram Bickle and owned by William Southam from 1892 until his death in 1932), as well as the large silver addition dubbed &quot;Spaceship 11&quot; for its futuristic appearance (built in 1983), for . The sale was to a private investor group named Television City, who would rent out half of &quot;Spaceship 11&quot; to CHCH-DT for two and a half years, while looking for other tenants (Pinehurst is protected by the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; and will not be altered). It was expected for the sale to close by the middle of November 2016.

In October 2018, CHCH announced a new location for its studios, leaving its long-time location on Jackson Street West in downtown Hamilton, and moving to 4 Innovation Drive in Dundas. The property was renovated for a news operation, which the station had originally intended to have up and running by the spring of 2021. While the station left the Jackson Street studio in June 2021, delays in renovations to 4 Innovation Drive forced it to move to a temporary studio across the street. On April 11, 2022, CHCH had begun broadcasting from its 4 Innovation Drive studios.

== Programming ==
As an independent station, CHCH produced local programs such as the children&#x27;s talent show &quot;Tiny Talent Time&quot; (which was revived in September 2014 in honour of the station&#x27;s 60th anniversary), Jane Gray&#x27;s &quot;Hobby Time&quot; and a daily talk show hosted by Elaine Callei.

The station also produced a number of important Canadian syndicated series in the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot;, &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot;, &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot;, &quot;Party Game&quot;, &quot;The Baxters&quot;, the Canadian version of &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, and &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot;, and was the original television home of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. Hamilton native Martin Short also made his television debut on the station. The 1986–87 syndicated revival of &quot;Split Second&quot; hosted by Monty Hall was also taped at CHCH&#x27;s studios; their involvement was noted in the credits of the show in Canadian broadcasts, whereas the American copies only noted distributor Viacom Enterprises.

As of September 2018, CHCH&#x27;s daytime programming consists of locally produced newscasts geared primarily to the Golden Horseshoe region of Southern Ontario, and a block of classic television series airing weekdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and featuring sitcoms and dramas from the 1970s and 1980s. In prime time, the station runs only a handful of first-run domestic and American entertainment programs during prime time and the late evening hours as well as movies. A syndication deal with 20th Television provided the station with programming from both the National Geographic Channel and MTM Enterprises libraries, but by September 2018, most of the National Geographic programming was dropped as the station had reformatted to emphasize its retro programming.

Some of CHCH&#x27;s imported programs air on CHEK-DT in Victoria, British Columbia, a separately-owned independent station which had been CHCH&#x27;s sister station during the WIC, CH and E! eras. Upon the initial dissolution of the E! system, the two stations jointly purchased a virtually identical lineup of prime time programming at first, although their prime time schedules later began to diverge. CHEK currently airs entertainment programs from Yes TV, which already serves the Toronto–Hamilton market with CITS-DT.

=== Sports programming ===
The station broadcast home games from the Hamilton Red Wings (a minor league hockey team in the OHA Junior &quot;A&quot; league that was an affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings) from the Hamilton Forum (which were both owned by Ken Soble) on Thursday nights in the 1960s, with Norm Marshall doing the play-by-play.

For a time, CHCH broadcast local mid-week telecasts of NHL games from the Toronto Maple Leafs, and co-produced Buffalo Sabres games with Adelphia Cable and the Sabres&#x27; owners. It also produced a wrestling show called &quot;Ringside Wrestling&quot;, which was filmed in the Telecentre, before later moving to the Hamilton Forum. The station later reproduced World Wrestling Federation programs for Canadian audiences before the company&#x27;s focus shifted entirely to cable television. For a number of years, CHCH also broadcast Sunday afternoon coverage of regular season games from the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills because CTV (and later, the Global Television Network) had to choose the Detroit Lions for its Ontario stations as part of that network&#x27;s NFL coverage (the Bills are now seen primarily on Sportsnet Ontario; the Lions have returned to CTV). McMaster Marauders university football was broadcast on the station during the late 1990s and early 2000s; beginning in 2015, CHCH resumed carrying Ontario University Athletics football, carrying the conference&#x27;s playoff tournaments and, beginning in 2017 after City passed on the package, some regular season games as well.

In August 2020, the Canadian Premier League announced a deal with CHCH to broadcast one game per week, every Sunday, in addition to the two games per week on CBC Sports.

In 2022, CHCH began airing final round coverage of LIV Golf events; it is the tour&#x27;s only traditional Canadian broadcaster (entire events are streamed on LIV Golf&#x27;s Facebook and YouTube pages).

=== News operation ===
CHCH airs hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).

==== Since 2008 ====

In late 2008, Canwest placed CHCH&#x27;s longest serving news anchors, Connie Smith (whose last day on the air occurred on November 28, 2008) and Dan McLean (who left on December 12) on forced retirement, blaming financial troubles and budget cuts. After their departures, Annette Hamm began handling anchoring duties on a shortened noon newscast, and co-hosting &quot;Morning Live&quot; with Bob Cowan, while Nick Dixon took over anchoring duties on the 6 p.m. newscast. Since being taken over by Channel Zero on August 31, 2009, Hamm and Cowan have co-hosted a restored hour-long newscast at noon. A few local non-news programming were also cancelled at this time including &quot;At Home&quot;, &quot;Sportscope&quot;, &quot;Niagara Express&quot;, and &quot;Straight Talk&quot;.

In January 2009, CHCH&#x27;s &quot;Morning Live&quot; program began to be simulcast on former Toronto sister station CIII-TV owing to the cancellation of its own morning newscast &quot;Global News Morning&quot;. The simulcast on CIII was dropped at the end of August after Channel Zero took control of CHCH, with CIII replacing it with lifestyle programming reruns and rebroadcasts of its 11 p.m. newscast from the previous night. While the station continued to share helicopter traffic services provided by the Canadian Traffic Network, the arrangement between Canwest and CHCH ended on December 31, 2009, as Canwest held the exclusive rights to CTN services in the Greater Toronto Area. Upon becoming an independent station on August 31, 2009, the station adopted a news-intensive format, replacing network programming in the 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. periods on weekdays with expanded newscasts.

On September 12, 2011, CHCH increased its local news programming by launching a 90-minute extension of &quot;Morning Live&quot;, titled &quot;Morning Live First Edition&quot;, airing weekdays from 4 to 5:30 a.m.; this made CHCH the first Canadian television station (and the first in the Buffalo–Niagara region; WGRZ would follow with a 4:30 a.m. newscast in 2012) to air a morning newscast that starts before 5:30 a.m. The program expanded to two hours, extending it from 4 to 6 a.m. on September 10, 2012. As a result, the station moved the original &quot;Morning Live&quot; broadcast&#x27;s start time by a half-hour and its end time by one hour, running it from 6 to 10 a.m.

Its heavy weekday newscast total was largely due to a prominent daytime rolling news block on weekdays (airing from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m., along with an hour-long newscast at 6 p.m., and 11 p.m.). In addition, the station also produced a half-hour sports discussion program called &quot;Sportsline&quot;, which aired each weeknight at 5 p.m.; and a half-hour political discussion program &quot;Square Off&quot;, which immediately followed &quot;Sportsline&quot; at 5:30 p.m. The rolling news block was removed for an hour at 1 p.m. to air &quot;Justice with Judge Mablean&quot;.

On December 11, 2015, at 4 p.m., Channel Zero CEO and Chairman Romen Podzyhun announced, in a pre-recorded message, that Channel 11 L.P., the division responsible for providing news programming for CHCH and the employer of the relevant staff, was declaring bankruptcy, and news programming was suspended immediately. He added that a major restructuring and changes to news coverage would start the following Monday.

==== Restructuring of the news operation ====
Because of the bankruptcy, the entire staff of 165 was cut in the news organization. The new company that was formed in the restructuring offered jobs to 81 people, including 58 full-time and 23 part-time positions. Chris Fuoco, Channel Zero vice-president, said that by 3 p.m. on December 15, 77 people had accepted the offer of employment with the new company.

The restructuring was viewed by some as a union-busting attempt in light of a December 14 note sent by a CHCH News Account manager, Kathleen Marks, to a prospective advertiser indicating that the new company would not be burdened by the union or old CanWest debt. The union, Unifor, asked Channel Zero to honour its commitment. According to the&quot; Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;Under Ontario law, businesses must honour existing collective agreements when they take over a company unless they dramatically change the nature of the work being performed.&quot;

A &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; article on December 16 indicated that a meeting between Channel Zero and Unifor was scheduled for later that day and that Channel Zero insisted that the note about the union was written by an individual who was not a company spokesperson. Sarah Gardiner of Channel Zero also countered the union-busting allegation, stating that it was false and adding that &quot;Many unionized employees were hired&quot; [by the new company]. The amount offered to laid-off employees is in dispute with Channel Zero claiming a minimum of $4000 to be paid per person (for any accrued vacation, expense reimbursements and regular pay) and some employees disputing that amount. A news item on the CHCH web site which was dated December 15, indicated that no severance pay had been offered to any employee, although all were union members. The bankruptcy documents indicate $1.6 million owed to employees, though without specifics.

After several calls, emails, and social media posts from viewers over the two months since the restructuring, CHCH announced on February 18, 2015, that &quot;Morning Live&quot; would return to a start time of 6 a.m. on February 22. The show would be live from 6 to 9 a.m., with the 8 a.m. hour broadcast repeated from 9 to 10 a.m.

On September 7, 2016, CHCH announced the return of local weekend news programming with two half hours of news at 6 and 11 p.m. starting October 29, 2016, citing advertiser and viewer demand. The announcement came three months after the CRTC announced plans to launch a fund to subsidize local newscasts.

==== Affected on-air employees ====
The CHCH web site said that &quot;Going forward, &quot;Morning Live&quot; will air between 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., the 6 o&#x27;clock newcast will be anchored by Nick Dixon and Taz Boga, and Taz will return for a half hour at 11:00 p.m.&quot; Metroland Media reported that Nick Dixon would also produce the 6 p.m. newscast, and that the on-air personalities or reporters who had been laid off include Lori D&#x27;Angelis, Matt Hayes, Sean Cowan, Donna Skelly, Ken Welch, Scot Urquhart, Lauran Sabourin, Liz West, Mark Hebscher, Jaclyn Harper (Colville), Natalie Marconi, Miranda Anthistle, and Elise Copps. The shorter &quot;Morning Live&quot; show continued to be anchored by Bob Cowan and Annette Hamm.

&quot;Square Off&quot; became a podcast called &quot;Unplugged&quot;, and later &quot;No Fun Intended&quot; by former co-hosts Mark Hebscher and Liz West; it had the same format. However, it appears the podcast ended; both Hebscher and West moved on to independent projects. Hebscher hosted a sports-focused podcast until he retired in May 2023. West is a radio announcer for Zoomer Radio AM740.

== Technical information ==

=== Subchannel ===
=== Analogue-to-digital conversion ===

The station launched its digital signal on UHF channel 18 on April 18, 2008. CHCH shut down its analogue signal, over VHF channel 11, on August 15, 2011, two weeks prior to the August 31 date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to its former analogue-era VHF channel 11. The analogue signal was discontinued immediately preceding the switch. CHCH-DT is available on digital cable and over-the-air through digital tuners and converter boxes. Since September 12, 2011, CHCH&#x27;s HD feed has been carried by satellite provider Bell Satellite TV on channel 1057.

On March 9, 2012, Channel Zero-operated numbered company 2190015 Ontario Inc. was granted permission to move the station&#x27;s broadcasts from VHF channel 11 to UHF channel 15 (which had recently been vacated by CKXT-DT-1), in response to poor reception of CHCH-DT along its fringes in the Greater Toronto Area, compared to its former analogue signal on VHF channel 11 and transitional digital signal on UHF channel 18. During the application process, the station also claimed that Mobile DTV services perform better in the UHF band, and this move would allow the station to plan for a potential Mobile DTV feed. Industry Canada stated that this application is technically feasible, though pirate broadcaster Star Ray TV, had broadcast in analogue on UHF channel 15 from a transmitter in The Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto. (Star Ray would convert to digital following CHCH&#x27;s reassignment to channel 15, broadcasting on UHF channel 22.) Tri-State Christian Television&#x27;s WNYB from Jamestown, New York also has a Buffalo-based translator, WBNF-CD, on UHF channel 15, which would require addressing by the CRTC due to the closer location of CHCH&#x27;s transmitter to WBNF-CD.

On November 12, 2013, CHCH began transmitting a test signal on UHF channel 15, displaying colour bars and tone with text message reading &quot;CHCH-DT RF15 Testing&quot;. On December 2, 2013, CHCH moved its digital signal to channel 15, allowing CHCH to broadcast with a considerably higher power of 132 kW compared to 6 kW on channel 11 and 60 kW from their former transitional digital frequency on channel 18. The station&#x27;s virtual channel continues to be mapped as 11.1.

=== Transmitters ===
On August 28, 1996, CHCH received CRTC approval to add new rebroadcast transmitters across most of Ontario. The launch of the transmitters in 1997 coincided with the rebranding of the station as &quot;ONtv&quot;.


During the analog television shutdown and digital conversion in August 2011, CHCH&#x27;s transmitters in Ottawa, London, and Muskoka (serving Barrie which is part of the Toronto market) were converted to digital. This was because the transmitters were in or near markets that were mandated to make the switch. At the time, the transmitters broadcast the channel in standard-definition 480i due to depending on Shaw Broadcast Services, which did not carry CHCH HD. As of September 2014, transmission was upgraded to 1080i.

<text>Laudium () is an Indian township southwest of central Pretoria, in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. Claudius is a residential suburb that is effectively an extension of Laudium.

== History ==
Older aerial photographs show remains of circular type dwellings to the west of Laudium, built by its earliest inhabitants.

The original name for Laudium was &quot;Claudius&quot;, and it was initially planned as a white area, named after Claudius Marais de Vries who owned a farm called &quot;Mooiplats&quot; and was a former mayor of Pretoria.

Laudium was created by the Apartheid government as part of their policy aimed at moving ethnic groups out of Marabastad and central Pretoria, which were zoned as &#x27;White Areas&#x27; following the passage of the Group Areas Act. Laudium was proclaimed as an Indian township in 1961.

The eastern portion of the original Claudius retained its name and white population for a time, but the white population of Claudius has been displaced by Indians (it was eventually also declared an Indian area by the Apartheid government, to reduce housing shortages in Laudium), and Claudius had effectively become an extension of Laudium by 1980.

Claudius straddles the R55 (Quagga Road), and parts of Second Avenue, Third Avenue, and Cuprene Street technically are part of Claudius, along with Sunrise School , however this smaller part of Cladius, west of the R55 is often regarded as part of Laudium, with the R55 being commonly thought of as the dividing line.

Extensions 2 and 3 are hilly and lie north of a railway line that linked the PPC dolomite quarry near Erasmia with Iscor&#x27;s Pretoria Works. The railway line was abandoned by the mid-2000s, however, the railway right-of-way is still clearly visible, and it limits the road linkages between the upper and lower parts of Laudium to a bridge connecting Bengal Street to First Avenue, and a link between 19th Avenue and 33rd Avenue that was constructed in the early 1990s.
In 1981, an Umkhonto weSizwe rocket attack on the Voortrekkerhoogte (now Thaba Tshwane) military base was launched from Laudium. The homes of local politicians who supported Apartheid were also bombed in the 1980s.

In 2012, Claudius east of the R55 had a wall and security gate system (road closure) installed, which residents have free access to as every resident paid a small portion of the cost of building the wall however, visitors have to fill out an entry/visitors book before entering, making it a gated community.

Although Laudium was initially part of Pretoria, it was incorporated into Centurion following the end of apartheid. Centurion, including Laudium, was incorporated into the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in 2000.

Dolomitic sinkholes occasionally cause significant damage to property and streets in Laudium. The dolomite risk area extends southwards from the railway line. Decaying water, sewerage and storm-water infrastructure has seen a rise in sinkhole formations.

== Demographics ==
Laudium has a large number of Hindu and Muslim residents, with a large number of temples and mosques, the oldest temple being the Shree Pretoria Hindu Seva Samaj and mosque PMT Jumma Masjid in Jewel Street. Many of the Hindu residents are Gujarati (mostly from Gujarat) or Tamils (from South India). Many of the Muslim residents are Memons, Kokanis or Surtis. There are also many recent South Asian (Indian and Pakistani) residents, who immigrated to South Africa after the end of Apartheid. Probably due to its visible Muslim population, it is also a destination for many Muslim refugees from other African countries.

Laudium was a relatively wealthy area (which was unusual for a township), with very large mansions visible from the R55 road. However, due to the crime in the area many residents have abandoned the area for the safer greener southern or eastern gated communities in the suburbs of Centurion. Most of the large bungalows are subdivided and rented out to immigrants (Indian, Pakistani, Egyptians, Moroccans and Somalians). 
The area is in decline, mainly due to crime, unemployment and drugs.

An economically deprived area of Laudium (described in an academic paper as a &quot;ghetto&quot;), informally called &quot;White Blocks&quot; (named after their paint colour), with single and multi-family government-built dwelling units is situated in the western part of Laudium. However, the Indian township of Lotus Gardens was established in the early 1990s, north of Church Street, and many Indian families from White Blocks were relocated there, and some old units were torn down. Lotus Gardens developed into a multiracial suburb. White Blocks continues to exist though the units are no longer exclusively painted white. The Laudium Police Station is in White Blocks, in a converted unit.

Another public housing development, in Extension 2, consisting of council flats, was later sold to residents and is now called &quot;Himalaya Heights&quot; and &quot;Bangladesh Heights&quot;.

After the end of Apartheid, many residents of Laudium moved to the neighbouring (formerly whites-only) suburbs of Erasmia and Christoburg which lie directly south of Laudium, relieving housing pressure caused by segregation, and, eventually, a link road was constructed, and later tarred, allowing for direct travel between the suburbs (previously, the only way to travel between Laudium and Erasmia was a circuitous route via the R55 and M26), and by the time of the 2001 census, Indians made up almost 66% of the population of Erasmia and Christoburg, having largely displaced their white residents in the preceding ten years. Significant numbers of more affluent Indian residents began relocating out of Laudium, to newly established nearby security estates in western Centurion in the late 2000s. Indians who reside in these areas often maintain religious, commercial and educational ties to Laudium itself.

The black township of Atteridgeville lies directly north of Laudium, although the two areas are separated by a series of hills, and no direct tarred road link exists between the two.

Laudium has 3 extensions which were completed in 1976, 1978 and 1983, respectively. Extension 1 consists of the western part of White Blocks, Extension 2 lies on the eastern portion of the hills north of the original suburb, and Extension 3 is west of Extension 2. The municipal Geographic Information System also lists and Extension 4, which is west of the suburb, and consists of non-residential land, including the Laudium Cemetery, the Laudium Stadium, Hindu Seva Samaj school, and Tshwane Muslim School.

A squatter camp established post-apartheid, called Itireleng lies south of the area called &quot;Kathmandu&quot;, a part of Extension 3.

== Education ==
Laudium has a large number of government schools. However, since the end of Apartheid, most Indian children from Laudium have begun attending newly established private religious schools, or schools in formerly white areas (&quot;ex-model C schools&quot; and private schools). While the government schools continue to be staffed mostly by Indian teachers, most of the pupils in these schools are black and commute daily from black townships.

=== Public Schools ===

* Andrew Anthony Primary School
* Hillside Primary School
* Himalaya Secondary School
* Jacaranda Primary School
* Laudium Heights Primary School
* Laudium Primary School
* Laudium Secondary School (Laudium High)
* Rosina Sedibane Sports School
* Sunrise School
=== Private schools ===

* Pretoria Hindu School (now Amity International School, Erasmia)
* PMT Sunni School
* Central Islamic School
* Pretoria Muslim School
* Al Ghazali College (in Erasmia)
* Al-Asr Educational Institute (in Claudius)
There are many Islamic educational institutes which specializes in teaching Islamic Sciences 
namely the &quot;Sunni Darul Uloom Pretoria&quot;

The Transvaal College of Education, which trained Indian teachers in the former Transvaal province was moved to a large campus in Laudium. However, after the end of apartheid, the college was deemed redundant and closed down (Indian teachers were no longer barred from colleges formerly used by white teachers). The college campus is now used by the Rosina Sedibane Sports School.

== Healthcare ==
The Laudium Hospital, a state hospital created under apartheid for Indians from Laudium and surrounding areas, closed down, and is now the Laudium Community Health Centre. This is controlled by the provincial department of health. Most if not all of the residents of the informal settlement (Itirileng) make use of the community health care centre. The facility is staffed mainly by foreign Cuban, Nigerian or Congolese doctors. 
In addition to the community healthcare centre a clinic operates at the heart in the CBD of Laudium which is a municipal clinic controlled by the municipality. This clinic offers primary healthcare. It has no beds and is strictly a day clinic. 
Laudium has a number of private medical practitioners and pharmacies.
Laudium does not have a healthcare facility with radiological services (x-ray, CT scan, MRI or ultrasound).

== Religion ==

Multiple religions are followed in Laudium. This includes Christianity, Hinduism and Islam.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
As with most townships under apartheid, road access was limited to allow for easy control by the security forces. Laudium also had only one entrance west of the R55 road, which links Laudium to central Pretoria as well as Centurion. It now has four access points. A dual carriageway, which is part of the R55, links Laudium with central Pretoria, while the deteriorated single-carriageway link to Centurion, which is also part of the R55, was upgraded to a dual carriageway by 2013. Freeway access is served by the N14, which is accessed via the R55 a few kilometers south. The N14 westbound from the R55 connects Laudium and surrounding areas to the West Rand, and the eastbound lanes are used to access the N1 to Johannesburg, via the Brakfontein interchange in Centurion.

Road links to the economically and academically important eastern suburbs of Pretoria are poor, usually requiring drivers to traverse the city centre or rat run across the Thaba Tshwane military base.

Although not a strict street grid, Laudium&#x27;s street names follow a pattern, with north–south streets being numbered &quot;Avenues&quot; (with a few exceptions in Extension 3 where some avenues are named after cities in South Asia), while east–west streets are named, often after minerals and gemstones, colours (Extension 1, white blocks) or South Asian geographical features (Extensions 2 and 3).

=== Public transport ===
Public transport links are limited, and, although limited municipal bus services were introduced following the end of apartheid, minibus taxis remain the primary mode of public transport. Bus services to Johannesburg were available during the apartheid era (The Laudium Bus Service), but are no longer available. Tuktuks are also available at relatively low prices.

== Economics ==
Laudium originally had shops with limited items. Most of the shopping was done outside of Laudium. Post 1994, possibly coinciding with the rise of new residents, the increase in formal and informal retail has been noticeable. Many residences around the CBD have been converted to commercial.

Prior to 1994, there were no sit-down restaurants in Laudium. The few that attempted, including Nawab&#x27;s eventually closed down. As of 2017, there were at least five restaurants and a number of fast food franchise outlets. Almost all of the restaurants are foreign Pakistani, Indian or Bangladeshi restaurants. This is also reflected in the majority of businesses in Laudium which are by far foreign owned. Again this is a further reflection of the greater picture in the country in which the majority of small business in all suburbs, townships and metropolitan areas are foreign owned..

<text>Frank Simmons Leavitt (June 30, 1891 – May 29, 1953) was an American professional wrestler of the early 1900s, known by the ring name Man Mountain Dean.

==Early life==
Leavitt was born in New York City, the son of John McKenney Leavitt and Henrietta N. (née Decker) Leavitt. From childhood, Leavitt was above average in size and strength. This led to a lifelong interest in competitive sport, and also enabled him to lie about his age in order to join the Army at the age of fourteen.

While enlisted he saw duty on the Mexico–United States border with John J. Pershing, and was later sent to France where he participated in combat during World War I. Also during this period (1914) he began his wrestling career using the ring name of &quot;Soldier Leavitt&quot;.

==Professional wrestling career==
After the war, Leavitt embarked on a career in athletics. Although he played guard and center for the New York Brickley Giants of the National Football League (NFL) in 1921, he concentrated most of his efforts on professional wrestling. He competed in the ring for a time under the name &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Bill-Bill&quot; (a &quot;hillbilly&quot; reference which was suggested to him by the writer Damon Runyon) but eventually settled on the moniker of &quot;Stone Mountain&quot;.
Leavitt wrestled with limited success at first, and after an injury took a job in 1925 as a Miami Beach police officer. He worked for the City of Miami Beach Police Department for one year. In 1926 he transferred to the City of Miami Police Department where he became a traffic officer. He was a fixture at his traffic post at East Flagler Street and 2nd Avenue. Starting in 1926, the City of Miami would send Leavitt on summer publicity tours across the United States and Canada to promote Miami. While on his traffic post in Miami he met his wife, Doris Dean Cooper, who also became his manager. In 1930 Leavitt was fired from the police force for visiting Al Capone&#x27;s residence on Palm Island in Miami Beach. In 1932, at his wife&#x27;s suggestion, he adopted the nickname &quot;Man Mountain&quot; and substituted the more Anglo-Saxon-sounding last name of Dean. At a stocky 5&#x27;11&quot; and weighing over 300 pounds, Dean was an imposing figure. He also grew a long, full beard as part of his ring persona. After a successful wrestling tour of Germany which had been booked by his wife, Doris Dean, he was invited to take a job in the UK as stunt-double for Charles Laughton in the movie &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII.&quot; This would be the beginning of a subsidiary movie career for Dean, who would appear in various roles in twelve other movies, playing himself in five of them. One of the movies in which he portrayed himself was the Joe E. Brown comedy &quot;The Gladiator&quot;, a 1938 adaptation of Philip Gordon Wylie&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

Meanwhile, he continued a successful wrestling career, participating altogether in 504 professional bouts; he commanded fees of upwards of $1,500 for each match. In 1940 he retired from the ring to a farm outside of Norcross, Georgia.

Dean ran for a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives in 1938 but withdrew his candidacy, citing discomfort with the political process. During World War II he again joined the Army despite his age, and eventually retired with the rank of master sergeant. In the 1940s he was the First Sergeant of the Military Intelligence Training Center at Camp Ritchie, Md., where he instructed soldiers in hand-to-hand combat. Afterward he studied at the University of Georgia&#x27;s school of journalism. He appeared as a guest on the December 29, 1944 episode of the radio program &quot;It Pays to be Ignorant&quot;. During the program, broadcast from New York City, Dean gave his weight as 280 pounds (127 kg). Several other wrestlers would go on to use the &quot;Man Mountain Dean Jr.&quot; and &quot;Man Mountain&quot; moniker, including Man Mountain Mike, Man Mountain Link and Man Mountain Rock.

==Death==
Dean died of a heart attack in his home in Norcross, Georgia, aged 61, in 1953, and is buried in Marietta National Cemetery under a military marker bearing his birth name and an erroneous year of birth (1889) that likely represents the year Dean put when he joined the Army.

==Filmography==
==Championships and accomplishments==
*Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum
**Class of 2021
*Southern California Pro-Wrestling Hall of Fame
**Inducted 2017

Dean and his life story was featured in the June 2022 edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; under the title &quot;The Classified Case of the Pro Wrestler Who Helped Beat the Nazis&quot; and primarily examined his time as a trainer at Camp Ritchie.

<text>Willem Werner Hubert &quot;Willy&quot; Claes (; born 24 November 1938) is a Belgian politician who served as the eighth Secretary General of NATO, from 1994 to 1995. Claes was forced to resign from his NATO position after he was found guilty of corruption, which was uncovered during the investigation into André Cools&#x27; death. Claes was a member of the Flemish Socialist Party.

Claes was born in Hasselt, Belgium. He graduated in political and diplomatic sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).

== Political career ==
Claes began his political career in the Hasselt city council. In 1968, he was elected to the national parliament. In 1972, he entered the cabinet for the first time as minister of education. Between 1973 and 1992, he was minister of economic affairs of Belgium three separate times. He also served as deputy prime minister five times, and was an important negotiator in the formation of coalition governments during the 1980s.

Claes was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 until 1994 in the Government Jean-Luc Dehaene I, during which period he presided over Belgium&#x27;s withdrawal from the UN peacekeeping mission in Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. Belgium&#x27;s withdrawal and the subsequent proposal by Claes of the withdrawal at the UN of all UN-Troops is thought to have dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, leading to thousands of deaths.

Claes was also Secretary General of NATO from 1994 until 1995, when he resigned after the discovery of a bribe of over 50 million Belgian francs (BEF), accepted at the time he was minister of economic affairs and connected to the defence contract negotiations with Agusta and Dassault. A criminal trial was handled by the Court of Cassation, which is responsible for cases involving minister in function. Claes received a 60 000 BEF fine, a three-year probationary sentence and a five-year prohibition on running for public office. An appeal at the European Court of Human Rights resulted in the confirmation of the Belgian sentence.

==Musical career==
Claes is known for being a pianist and has frequently performed concerts. Even as secretary-general of NATO, he had a piano in his residence to keep in practice.

== Honours ==
* Minister of State
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold II.

<text>Silent Running is a 1972 American environmental-themed science fiction film. It is the directorial debut of Douglas Trumbull, and stars Bruce Dern, Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin, and Jesse Vint.

==Plot==
In the future, all forests on Earth have become extinct from careless environmental exploitation. As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of enormous greenhouse-like geodesic domes serving as closed ecological systems attached to large cargo spaceships, forming part of a fleet of eight &quot;American Airlines Space Freighters&quot;, stationed outside the orbit of Saturn.

Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen, is the resident botanist and ecologist on one of these ships, the &quot;Valley Forge.&quot; He carefully maintains a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. He spends most of his time in the domes, cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life.

The crew of each ship receives orders to jettison and destroy their domes and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six &quot;Valley Forge&quot; domes are jettisoned and destroyed with nuclear charges, Lowell rebels and opts to save his ship&#x27;s plants and animals. He kills Wolf, one of his crewmates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of the other remaining dome to trap and kill the remaining two crewmen.

Enlisting the aid of the ship&#x27;s three service robots, Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; speeding toward Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; on a risky course through Saturn&#x27;s rings. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell gives the surviving drones the names Dewey (Drone 1) and Huey (Drone 2), while the lost Drone 3 is named Louie (a nod to Disney characters Huey, Dewey, and Louie).

Lowell, Huey, and Dewey set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. He also has them bury Andy Wolf in the bio-dome. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children.

Huey is damaged when Lowell accidentally collides with him while driving a buggy recklessly, and Dewey sentimentally refuses to leave Huey&#x27;s side during the repairs. As time passes, Lowell is horrified when he discovers that his bio-dome is dying, but is unable to come up with a solution to the problem. When the &quot;Berkshire&quot;—another space freighter waiting to see if the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; has survived the trip around Saturn—eventually reestablishes contact, he knows that his crimes will soon be discovered. It is then that he realizes a lack of light has restricted plant growth, and he races to install lamps to correct this situation. In an effort to save the last forest before the &quot;Berkshire&quot; arrives, Lowell jettisons the bio-dome to safety. He then detonates nuclear charges, destroying the &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, the damaged Huey, and himself in the process. The final scene is of the now well-lit forest greenhouse drifting into deep space, with Dewey tenderly caring for it, holding Lowell&#x27;s battered old watering can.

==Cast==

* Bruce Dern as Freeman Lowell
* Cliff Potts as John Wolf
* Ron Rifkin as Marty Barker
* Jesse Vint as Andy Keenan
* Mark Persons as Drone 1 (Dewey)
* Cheryl Sparks and Steven Brown as Drone 2 (Huey)
* Larry Whisenhunt as Drone 3 (Louie)

Note: Although the end credits do not associate the main actors with their character names, each crew member may be correctly identified by a patch on their right breast. The patch is in the form of a maritime signal flag corresponding to the initial letter of their surname.

==Production==
Trumbull was involved with creating effects for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), whose director, Stanley Kubrick, had wanted that film&#x27;s Stargate sequence to be about Saturn; however, technical difficulties prevented completion of the sequence&#x27;s special effects within the limited time available. The Saturn idea was scrapped, and Kubrick substituted Jupiter instead. Trumbull developed the sequence after production, and it was recreated for Saturn in &quot;Silent Running&quot;.

The interiors were filmed aboard the decommissioned Korean War aircraft carrier USS &quot;Valley Forge&quot; (LPH-8), which was docked at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in Long Beach, California. Shortly after filming was completed, the carrier was scrapped. The forest environments were originally intended to be filmed in the Mitchell Park Domes in Milwaukee, but the production budget forced the sequences to be shot in a newly completed aircraft hangar in Van Nuys, California. Trumbull stated in the commentary accompanying the DVD release that the geodesic domes containing the last forests of Earth&#x27;s future on the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; were based on the Missouri Botanical Garden&#x27;s Climatron dome.

Three freighters are shown in the film: the &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, the &quot;Berkshire&quot; and the &quot;Sequoia&quot;. Five other ships that carried domes—the &quot;Yellowstone, Acadia, Blue Ridge, Glacier,&quot; and &quot;Mojave&quot;—are also mentioned. Each ship features a designation on the hull that notes the area from which some of its flora and fauna samples were taken. The &quot;Valley Forge&quot; is listed as &quot;Bahia Honda Subtropical,&quot; indicating at least some specimens were taken from this area of the Florida Keys.

The model of the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was long, and took six months to build from a combination of custom castings and the contents of approximately 800 prefabricated model-aircraft or tank kits. After filming was completed, American Airlines expressed an interest in sending the model on the tour circuit, but this was not feasible due to its fragility. (During filming, pieces of the model frequently detached.) It was subsequently dismantled after sitting for several years in Trumbull&#x27;s personal storage facility. Several pieces, including the domes, wound up in the hands of collectors. Several domes survive, including one that now rests in the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, and another that was sold at auction in 2008.

The three drones were played by four bilateral amputees, an idea inspired by Johnny Eck, a sideshow performer of the early 20th century who was born without lower limbs. The drone suits were custom-tailored for the actors. The suits are in Trumbull&#x27;s personal collection.

The sound effects, including the drones, were created by uncredited composer Joseph Byrd. They were generated on a modified ARP 2600 synthesizer with added Oberheim Synthesizer Expander Modules (SEMs).

Footage from the film would later be reused in Universal Pictures&#x27;s 1978&#x27;s &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and its sequel &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, notably depicting the . Shots of the internal domes would also be re-used, with Dern making a fleeting cameo appearance in &quot;The Magnificent Warriors&quot; due to re-use of footage from the film.

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack was written by Peter Schickele, a bassoonist who also composed comedy music under the name P. D. Q. Bach. It contains two songs written by Schickele and Diane Lampert, which were performed by vocalist Joan Baez: &quot;Silent Running&quot; and &quot;Rejoice in the Sun&quot;. The two songs were issued as a single by Decca (32890). An LP was released by Decca in 1972 (DL 7-9188) and later reissued by Varese Sarabande on black (STV-81072) and green (VC-81072) vinyl. In 1998, a limited-release CD by the Valley Forge Record Groupe included an additional track with the spoken introduction &quot;God Bless These Gardens.&quot; A CD with audio restoration was released in 2016 by Intrada, Special Collection Volume 369.

The title song was later covered by David Matthews on his 1977 album &quot;Dune&quot;.

The band 65daysofstatic recorded an alternative soundtrack to the film, released in 2011 and commissioned by the Glasgow Film Festival.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 71% based on reviews from 34 critics. The critical consensus states: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t fulfill the potential of its ambitious themes, but &quot;Silent Running&quot; stands as a decidedly unique type of sci-fi journey marked by intimate character work and a melancholic mood.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 67% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby, reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that &quot;Silent Running&quot; &quot;is no jerry-built science fiction film, but it&#x27;s a little too simple-minded to be consistently entertaining.&quot; Carl Sagan criticized the &quot;technically proficient&quot; film for depicting a future in which people have forgotten the inverse-square law, and that plants need sunlight. Roger Ebert awarded the film his highest rating of four stars and praised Dern as &quot;a very good, subtle actor.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film two stars out of four and compared it unfavorably to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, saying that it had &quot;the same effects but none of the wit or intelligence.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; lauded the &quot;excellent special effects&quot; and &quot;broadly entertaining script&quot; but faulted the &quot;crucial miscasting&quot; of Dern, explaining, &quot;Walking around often in robes which crudely suggest some kind of airborne vegetarian Noah, and otherwise suggesting an out-to-lunch mentality, his characterization does not evoke empathy.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film for avoiding &quot;the usual heavy hokum associated with the [sci-fi] genre&quot; and called it &quot;a solid and well-disciplined first film. The spaceries really are impressive and the movie is an ingenious family entertainment which offers something to think about.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;the most original and interesting science-fiction melodrama since &#x27;Planet of the Apes&#x27; and a new classic of the genre.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;The robots have endearing qualities, paddling about as if in galoshes, and they play a wonderful game of poker, but this is sci-fi with the soul of an editorial.&quot; British film critic Mark Kermode has said that the film is a personal favorite and that he prefers it to &quot;2001&quot;.

Nods and various easter eggs to the film would make their way in numerous genre media, including Ronald D. Moore&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; miniseries and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2018 film adaptation &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. As testament to the film&#x27;s cult status, a screen-matched costume jumpsuit worn by Bruce Dern originating from Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s personal collection sold for $40,625 USD in 2020. In Super Mario Odyssey, various steam-powered robots are upkeeping a biome in a wooded area, much like the film.

==Adaptation==
A novelization of the film was published by Scholastic Books in 1972. It was written by longtime children&#x27;s book author Harlan Thompson, based on the screen story and screenplay by Cimino, Washburn, and Bochco. It features expanded scenes (in flashback) taking place on Earth.

==Home media==
The film has been released several times on home video by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, beginning with the Betamax &quot;pan and scan&quot; release in 1982, and several VHS releases that followed. A DVD was released featuring the film&#x27;s original 1.85:1 aspect ratio on May 21, 2002. A Blu-ray of the film was released on 14 November 2011 by Eureka for the film’s 40th-anniversary, initially in a steelbook case. Another was released by Arrow on 17 November 2020, from a 4K scan and 2K restoration of the film, with an additional extras. Both were released under license from Universal Studios, with transfers approved by director Douglas Trumbull. This same approved 4K transfer was used to create a 4K UHD version of the film, again released by Arrow Video in December 2022.

In 2012, he has received the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian honour, from the Government of India.

Beginning in the late 1990s, he appeared in character roles in several successful and acclaimed films, such as &quot;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot;, &quot;Life in a... Metro&quot;, &quot;Apne&quot;, &quot;Johnny Gaddaar&quot;, &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot;, &quot;Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani&quot; and &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya&quot;. In 1997, he received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to Bollywood. He was a member of the 15th Lok Sabha of India, representing the Bikaner constituency in Rajasthan from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

==Early and personal life==

Dharmendra was born as Dharmendra Kewal Krishan Deol in Nasrali, a village in Ludhiana district, Punjab, British India on 8 December 1935. He was born to Kewal Krishan and Satwant Kaur into a Punjabi Jat family. His ancestral village is Dangon, near Pakhowal Tehsil Raikot, Ludhiana.

He spent his early life in the village of Sahnewal and studied at Government Senior Secondary School at Lalton Kalan, Ludhiana, where his father was the village school headmaster. He did his matriculation in Phagwara in 1952. In those days, schools of Punjab came under Panjab University, Chandigarh.
Dharmendra&#x27;s first marriage was to Prakash Kaur at the age of 19 in 1954, before he entered film industry. He had two sons from this marriage, Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol, both successful film actors; and two daughters, Vijeeta and Ajeeta.

After moving to Bombay and entering films, Dharmendra married Hema Malini, which caused controversy at the time since he was already married. Rumours began to circulate about Dharmendra and Hema Malini converting to Islam for this marriage. In 2004, during a political campaign, when the rumours began to circulate again, Dharmendra asserted that he remained a Hindu, the family being Arya Samaji. He and Malini starred together in a number of movies in the early 1970s, including &quot;Sholay&quot;. The couple has two daughters, Esha Deol (an actress, born in 1981) and Ahana Deol (an assistant director, born in 1985). His grandson, Bobby Deol&#x27;s son, is also named &quot;Dharam&quot;, after him.

In 2019, Dharmendra&#x27;s grandson, Sunny Deol&#x27;s elder son, Karan Deol, made his debut as an actor with &quot;Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas&quot;, which was directed by Sunny Deol. In 2023, Sunny Deol&#x27;s younger son, Rajveer Deol, made his debut as an actor with &quot;Dono&quot;, directed by Avnish R. Barjatya, Sooraj R. Barjatya&#x27;s son.

Dharmendra has a farmhouse in Lonavala, where he now generally resides. His family resides in Juhu, Mumbai. In 2023, Dharmendra expressed that Bollywood neglected his family and never appreciated Deol family&#x27;s contribution to Indian cinema.

==Career==

===1960–1969: Early career and rise to prominence===

Dharmendra was the winner of &quot;Filmfare&quot; magazine&#x27;s nationally organised new talent award and went to Mumbai from Punjab to work in the movie. However, it was never made. He later made his film debut in 1960 with Arjun Hingorani&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere&quot;. The film largely went unnoticed and as a result, did not perform that well at the box office. He saw his first commercial success in 1961 with Ramesh Saigal&#x27;s &quot;Shola Aur Shabnam&quot; and followed it with hits, such as Mohan Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Anpadh&quot; (1962) and Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Bandini&quot; (1963), which won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.

His breakthrough came in 1964 when he co-starred alongside Rajendra Kumar and Saira Banu in another of Mohan Kumar&#x27;s directional venture &quot;Ayee Milan Ki Bela&quot;. It went on to become a superhit and despite playing the antagonist, Dharmendra got noticed by audience and received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category. That same year, he played the lead role in Chetan Anand&#x27;s war-drama &quot;Haqeeqat&quot;. Based on the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the film proved to be a major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a superhit with one of its song &quot;Ab Tumhare Hawaale Watan Saathiyon&quot;, a solo by Mohammed Rafi becoming hugely popular among the masses. In 1965, he had another major success in Ram Maheshwari&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Kaajal&quot;. The film also had Meena Kumari, Raaj Kumar and Padmini in the lead.

In 1966, Dharmendra reunited with Kumari for O. P. Ralhan&#x27;s &quot;Phool Aur Patthar&quot;. The film topped the box office chart in 1966, becoming a major blockbuster and making him a saleable star. He
received his first nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category for the film. The success of &quot;Phool Aur Patthar&quot; was followed by hits in &quot;Mamta&quot;, &quot;Devar&quot;, &quot;Anupama&quot; and &quot;Aaye Din Bahar Ke&quot;, the same year. He was also given a souvenir at the 14th National Film Awards in recognition of his performance in &quot;Anupama&quot;. The next year, he worked in commercially unsuccessful, but critically acclaimed films like - &quot;Dulhan Ek Raat Ki&quot; opposite Nutan and &quot;Majhli Didi&quot;, &quot;Chandan Ka Palna&quot;, both opposite Kumari. Dharmendra hit the big league in 1968 with Atma Ram&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Shikar&quot; and Ramanand Sagar&#x27;s spy thriller &quot;Ankhen&quot;. Both the films opened to positive audience response and proved to be blockbusters at the box office with the latter being the top–earning film that year. His other commercially successful releases of 1968 were – T. Prakash Rao&#x27;s drama film &quot;Izzat&quot; (in which he played a double role) and Amar Kumar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Mere Hamdam Mere Dost&quot;. The following year, saw the emergence of superstar Rajesh Khanna, who stormed the nation with back-to-back blockbusters in &quot;Aradhana&quot; and &quot;Do Raaste&quot;. With his rise, a number of stars went through career decline. During this phase, Dharmendra and Manoj Kumar were the only actors who remained unaffected by Khanna&#x27;s popularity. In 1969, he had a superhit in &quot;Aya Sawan Jhoom Ke&quot;, followed by three more successful films, which were - &quot;Yakeen&quot;, &quot;Pyar Hi Pyar&quot; and &quot;Aadmi Aur Insaan&quot;. Dharmendra also received immense acclaim for his portrayal of a righteous man in Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s social drama film &quot;Satyakam&quot;, which is widely considered to be his career-best performance by fans as well as critics and went on to win National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.

===1970–1977: Superstardom===

The year 1970 was a notable one for Dharmendra as he delivered four major successes and formed a hit pair with Hema Malini. His first release was Satyen Bose&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Jeevan Mrityu&quot;. An adaptation of Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, it proved to be major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a blockbuster and one of the top earners of 1970. His next two films, Bhappi Sonie&#x27;s &quot;Tum Haseen Main Jawan&quot; and Asit Sen&#x27;s &quot;Sharafat&quot;, both opposite Malini proved to be superhits at the box office. This was followed by a flop in &quot;Ishq Par Zor Nahin&quot; alongside Sadhana and a hit in &quot;Kab? Kyoon? Aur Kahan?&quot; with Babita. His final release of that year was Raj Kapoor&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; (in which he played a supporting role). Although the film was a disaster at the time of release, it attained cult status in later years, with many critics hailing it as one of the best Indian films of all time. In 1971, Dharmendra starred in Raj Khosla&#x27;s action drama &quot;Mera Gaon Mera Desh&quot;. The film went on to become an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and established his image of an action hero. The large success of this film also made the industry shift to action from romantic films. Dharmendra received his second nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category for his performance in &quot;Mera Gaon Mera Desh&quot;. His flow of successes continued in the following year with another massive blockbuster in &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;, a superhit in &quot;Raja Jani&quot; and a hit film, &quot;Samadhi&quot; to go with the major grossers. The mass hysteria created by &quot;Mera Gaon Mera Desh&quot; in 1971, followed by back-to-back hits with &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;, &quot;Raja Jani&quot; and &quot;Samadhi&quot; in 1972 took Dharmendra to number 1 position among his contemporaries, thus making him a &quot;Superstar&quot;.

1973 proved to be the best year of his career with many successes. His first release which was A. Bhimsingh&#x27;s action crime film &quot;Loafer&quot; emerged a superhit with its songs, including &quot;Aaj Mausam Bada Be-Imaan&quot;, &quot;Main Tere Ishq Mein&quot;, &quot;Koi Shehri Babu&quot; becoming immensely popular among the masses and making its soundtrack one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s. This was followed by mystery thriller &quot;Jheel Ke Us Paar&quot; and action drama &quot;Jugnu&quot;. While &quot;Jheel Ke Us Paar&quot; was a hit, the latter proved to be a blockbuster in India as well as Soviet Union, eventually taking 2nd spot at the box office in 1973. Owing to its huge success, &quot;Jugnu&quot; was also remade in Tamil and Telugu as &quot;Guru&quot; (1980). His next two releases were - Ravikant Nagaich&#x27;s spy thriller &quot;Keemat&quot; and Adurthi Subba Rao&#x27;s light-hearted drama film &quot;Jwaar Bhata&quot;. Both the films received critical acclaim and emerged moderately successful. Towards the end of the year, Dharmendra appeared in &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot;, &quot;Blackmail&quot; and &quot;Kahani Kismat Ki&quot;. &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot;, directed by Nasir Hussain and written by Salim-Javed is widely identified as the first masala film of Indian cinema and proved to be another blockbuster for the actor as well as the second best-selling Bollywood album of the 1970s. On the other hand, Vijay Anand&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Blackmail&quot; was an unsuccessful venture critically and commercially, but reception later improved, with many calling it one of Anand&#x27;s most underrated works. The song &quot;Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas&quot; filmed on Dharmendra and Raakhee was a chartbuster and remains popular till date. His final release of the year, Arjun Hingorani&#x27;s actioner &quot;Kahani Kismat Ki&quot; continued his dream run and emerged a superhit at the box office. The following year, Dharmendra added one more blockbuster in his kitty with Dulal Guha&#x27;s social drama &quot;Dost&quot; co-starring Shatrughan Sinha and Hema Malini. The huge box office success of &quot;Dost&quot; was followed by moderate successes in &quot;Patthar Aur Payal&quot; and &quot;Resham Ki Dori&quot;. For his performance in the latter, Dharmendra received his 4th and final nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category.

The 1975 Emergency had angered the public, and this helped films featuring the lead character revolting against corruption and establishment become successes. The shift from romantic and social movies to action-oriented multi-starrers changed the box office. The year saw the rise of another superstar, Amitabh Bachchan, but Dharmendra remained rock-steady and continued to deliver huge hits.

In 1975, Dharmendra appeared alongside Bachchan in two films. The first was Mukherjee&#x27;s light-hearted comedy &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot;. It received positive response from critics and went on to become a hit at the box office. The second was Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s actioner &quot;Sholay&quot;. It released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day, in Bombay. Due to lackluster reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. However, from the third week onward, viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth. During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea. After additionally releasing a soundtrack containing dialogue snippets, &quot;Sholay&quot; soon became an &quot;overnight sensation&quot;. The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975. It became the highest-grossing Hindi language film of 1975, and film ranking website Box Office India has given the film a verdict of &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot;. &quot;Sholay&quot; went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees across India, and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee at over 100 theatres. It was shown continuously at Bombay&#x27;s Minerva Theatre for over five years and in Kolkata&#x27;s Jyoti Cinema for almost two years. &quot;Sholay&quot; was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001.

Before the end of year, he delivered another blockbuster in &quot;Pratiggya&quot;. The film along with its strong action scenes also had a significant comic track in the form of &quot;slapstick&quot; comedy which led to it being referred as a &quot;masterpiece in comedy&quot;. In 1976, Dharmendra reunited with Ramanand Sagar for the action thriller &quot;Charas&quot;. Set against the backdrop of the expulsion of Indian community from Uganda by its dictator Idi Amin in 1972, it opened to bumper response all over the nation and emerged a superhit at the box office. His other release of the year, M. A. Thirumugam&#x27;s family drama film &quot;Maa&quot; was thrashed by critics, but still went on to become a success. The year 1977 proved to be a big one for Dharmendra with a mega blockbuster in Manmohan Desai&#x27;s action drama &quot;Dharam Veer&quot;, a superhit in another of Desai&#x27;s masala film &quot;Chacha Bhatija&quot;, followed by two more successful films in Arjun Hingorani&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Khel Khilari Ka&quot; and Pramod Chakravorty&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Dream Girl&quot;. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; had 23 shows in 5 cities. Driven by the success of Rafi&#x27;s songs, the film took a record initial of £50,000 in the UK, equivalent to . In addition, the film sold 32 million tickets in the Soviet Union.

===1978–1997: Continued success, decline and final works as a lead===

Post-1977, the quality of Dharmendra&#x27;s films dropped and so the number of huge grossers, but his initial draw remained intact, owing to which the flow of successes continued till the 1990s. In 1978 and 1979, he had superhits in &quot;Azaad&quot; co-starring Malini and &quot;Kartavya&quot; alongside Rekha, respectively. His other releases, including &quot;Phandebaaz&quot; (1978), &quot;Dillagi&quot; (1978) and &quot;Dil Kaa Heera&quot; (1979) also performed well commercially.

Dharmendra began the 1980s with Ravi Chopra&#x27;s big-budget action thriller &quot;The Burning Train&quot;. The film co-starring Jeetendra, Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini and Parveen Babi didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations and ended up as an average fare, however gained cult status in later years. His next two releases were - &quot;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&quot; and &quot;Ram Balram&quot;. While the former was a moderate success, the latter in which he reunited with Bachchan proved to be a box office hit. In 1981, he had a superhit in &quot;Kaatilon Ke Kaatil&quot;, but other releases, such as &quot;Aas Paas&quot; and &quot;Krodhi&quot; failed to leave a mark while Brij Sadanah&#x27;s big-budget actioner &quot;Professor Pyarelal&quot; ended up as an average grosser. This changed in 1982 as five of his films emerged commercial successes, these were - &quot;Rajput&quot;, &quot;Badle Ki Aag&quot;, &quot;Ghazab&quot;, &quot;Baghavat&quot; and &quot;Samraat&quot;.

In 1983, Dharmendra delivered a hit in Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Naukar Biwi Ka&quot;, followed by another success, &quot;Qayamat&quot;, but his most anticipated film of that year, Kamal Amrohi&#x27;s period biographical film &quot;Razia Sultan&quot; was a box office disaster. The next year, he had seven releases, out of which &quot;Baazi&quot;, &quot;Jagir&quot;, &quot;Jeene Nahi Doonga&quot; and &quot;Dharm Aur Qanoon&quot; did reasonable business, but rest were critical and commercial failures. In 1985, Dharmendra starred in J. P. Dutta&#x27;s action drama film &quot;Ghulami&quot; which also had Mithun Chakraborty, Naseeruddin Shah, Reena Roy and Smita Patil in the lead. The film opened to positive reviews from critics and emerged a superhit as well as one of the top five highest-earners of that year. Its song, &quot;Zeehale Muskin Makun ba-Ranjish&quot;, sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Shabbir Kumar was a chartbuster and got featured in the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala. The following year, he had another commercial success with Ambrish Sangal&#x27;s &quot;Begaana&quot; (1986), co-starring Kumar Gaurav and Rati Agnihotri.

Dharmendra returned to the big league in 1987 by delivering eight successful films in the year. His first two releases were - Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s and Raj N. Sippy&#x27;s actioners &quot;Insaniyat Ke Dushman&quot; and &quot;Loha&quot;, respectively, both of which proved to be box office hits. He then appeared in &quot;Dadagiri&quot;, &quot;Hukumat&quot; and &quot;Aag Hi Aag&quot;. While &quot;Dadagiri&quot; was an average fare, the latter two went on to become superhits with &quot;Hukumat&quot; emerging as the highest-grossing film of the year. This was followed by T. Rama Rao&#x27;s hit venture &quot;Watan Ke Rakhwale&quot; and two more successful films, &quot;Insaaf Kaun Karega&quot; with Rajinikanth and &quot;Insaf Ki Pukar&quot;, co-starring Jeetendra. His other hit ventures of the decade, include &quot;Khatron Ke Khiladi&quot; (1988) and &quot;Elaan-E-Jung&quot; (1989).

With the advent of the 1990s, Dharmendra&#x27;s star power began to wane. From 1990 to 1992, his successful films included &quot;Naakabandi&quot; (1990), &quot;Veeru Dada&quot; (1990), &quot;Humse Na Takrana&quot; (1990), &quot;Kohraam&quot; (1991), &quot;Virodhi&quot; (1992) and &quot;Tahalka&quot; (1992), which also proved to be his final hit as a lead actor. The following year, he appeared in J. P. Dutta&#x27;s ensemble action film &quot;Kshatriya&quot; co-starring Sunil Dutt, Vinod Khanna, Rakhee Gulzar, Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol, Meenakshi Seshadri, Raveena Tandon and Divya Bharti. &quot;Kshatriya&quot; took a record opening, but collections dropped afterwards owing to poor critical reception and it ended up as a flop. In the mid-1990s, he delivered average fares in &quot;Policewala Gunda&quot; (1995) and &quot;Mafia&quot; (1996), but his other releases, including biggies, such as &quot;Maidan-E-Jung&quot; (1995) and &quot;Return of Jewel Thief&quot; (1996) proved to be box office failures.

In 1997, Dharmendra received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. While accepting the award from Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu, he became emotional and remarked that he had never won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor despite having worked in so many successful films and nearly a hundred popular films. Speaking on this occasion Dilip Kumar commented, &quot;Whenever I get to meet with God Almighty, I will set before him my only complaint – why did you not make me as handsome as Dharmendra?&quot;.

===1998–present: Shift to character roles ===

Since the late-1990s, Dharmendra has appeared in character roles. His first film in such a role was Sohail Khan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; (1998), co-starring Salman Khan, Kajol and Arbaaz Khan. The film received positive reviews from critics and became a superhit at the box office.

His first two major releases of the new decade were &quot;Kaise Kahoon Ke... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2003) and &quot;Kis Kis Ki Kismat&quot; (2004), both of which were box office failures. After this, Dharmendra went on a hiatus for a brief period and returned with three films in 2007. These were - Anurag Basu&#x27;s drama film &quot;Life in a... Metro&quot;, Anil Sharma&#x27;s sports drama &quot;Apne&quot; and Sriram Raghavan&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;Johnny Gaddaar&quot;. Both, &quot;Life in a... Metro&quot; and &quot;Apne&quot; proved to be critical and commercial successes. On the other hand, &quot;Johnny Gaddaar&quot;, despite failing at the box office, received praise from critics and attained cult status in later years. The same year, he made a guest appearance in the song &quot;Deewangi Deewangi&quot; from Farah Khan&#x27;s blockbuster reincarnation drama &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot;. In 2011, Dharmendra starred in &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; and &quot;Tell Me O Kkhuda&quot;. While the latter was a commercial disaster, &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; performed very well and emerged a box office hit. He then appeared in sequels to &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot;, 
&quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana 2&quot; (2013) and &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se&quot; (2018), but unlike the first film, both the sequels received poor audience response.

In 2023, he appeared in Karan Johar&#x27;s ensemble family drama &quot;Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani&quot;. It opened to a polarising response from reviewers but grossed over worldwide and proved to be a hit as well as the tenth highest-grossing Indian film of the year. The following year, Dharmendra co-starred alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon in the romantic comedy &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya&quot;. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but still did a lifetime business of worldwide to emerge a commercial success.

===Frequent collaborations===
His most successful pairing was with Hema Malini, who went on to become his wife. The couple played together in many films including &quot;Tum Haseen Main Jawaan&quot;, &quot;Sharafat&quot;, &quot;Naya Zamana&quot;, &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;, &quot;Raja Jani&quot;, &quot;Jugnu&quot;, &quot;Dost&quot;, &quot;Patthar Aur Payal&quot;, &quot;Sholay&quot;, &quot;Charas&quot;, &quot;Maa&quot;, &quot;Chacha Bhatija&quot; and &quot;Azaad&quot;.

He has worked with various directors, each with a different style of filmmaking. His longest collaboration was with director Arjun Hingorani from 1960 to 1991. &quot;Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere&quot; was the debut film of Dharmendra as an actor and Arjun&#x27;s first directorial venture with Dharmendra as the lead hero. They worked together in &quot;Kab? Kyoon? Aur Kahan?&quot;, &quot;Kahani Kismat Ki&quot;, &quot;Khel Khilari Ka&quot;, &quot;Katilon Ke Kaatil&quot; and &quot;Kaun Kare Kurbanie&quot; where Arjun Hingorani was the producer and the director, and &quot;Sultanat&quot; and &quot;Karishma Kudrat Kaa&quot;, produced by Arjun Hingorani. He worked with director Pramod Chakravorty in &quot;Naya Zamana&quot;, &quot;Jugnu&quot;, &quot;Dream Girl&quot; and &quot;Azaad&quot;. Anil Sharma worked with him in many films including &quot;Hukumat&quot;, &quot;Elaan-E-Jung&quot;, &quot;Farishtay&quot;, &quot;Tahalka&quot; and &quot;Apne&quot;.

===Works in other languages===
In the starting of his film career he worked in the Bengali film &quot;Paari&quot; (1966) directed by Jagannath Chatterjee. The film also featured Dilip Kumar and Keshto Mukherjee in key roles.

He has periodically appeared in films in his native tongue of Punjabi, starring in &quot;Kankan De Ohle&quot; (1970), &quot;Do Sher&quot; (1974), &quot;Dukh Bhanjan Tera Naam&quot; (1974), &quot;Teri Meri Ik Jindri&quot; (1975), &quot;Putt Jattan De&quot; (1982) and &quot;Qurbani Jatt Di&quot; (1990). He returned to Punjabi cinema after a gap with the 2014 film &quot;Double Di Trouble&quot;.

==Other works==

===Political career===
Dharmendra served as a Member of the Indian Parliament (Lok Sabha) from Bharatiya Janata Party representing Bikaner in Rajasthan from 2004 to 2009. During his election campaign in 2004, he made an offensive remark that he should be elected dictator perpetuo to teach &quot;basic etiquette that democracy requires&quot; for which he was severely criticised. He rarely attended Parliament when the house was in session, preferring to spend time shooting movies or working at his farmhouse, for which he was also widely criticised.

===Television===

In 2011, Dharmendra replaced Sajid Khan as the male judge of the third series of popular reality show &quot;India&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. On 29 July 2011, the show aired on Colors TV with Dharmendra as the new judge and surpassed the opening ratings of the previous two seasons.

In 2023, he appeared in his first television acting role as Salim Chisti in the historical series &quot;&quot; which is available on ZEE5.

===Producing and presenting films===
In 1983, Dharmendra set up a production company known as Vijayta Films. In its maiden venture &quot;Betaab&quot;, released in 1983, Vijayta Films launched Dharmendra&#x27;s elder son Sunny Deol as the lead actor. The film was the second highest-grossing film of the year. In 1990 he produced the action film &quot;Ghayal&quot;, also starring Sunny. The film won seven Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film. It won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Dharmendra then launched the career of his younger son, Bobby, in 1995 with &quot;Barsaat&quot;, which was again a super hit at the box office.

He was the presenter for his films like &quot;Satyakam&quot; (1969) and &quot;Kab Kyun Aur Kahan&quot; (1970).

== Legacy ==

Dharmendra is widely regarded as one of the most influential personalities in Indian cinema. He was considered one of the most handsome men in the world during his early career and is widely known as the &quot;He-Man&quot; of Bollywood. In 2022, he was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actors&quot; list. &quot;Rediff.com&quot; placed him 10th in its &quot;Top 10 Bollywood Actors of All Time&quot; list.

Dharmendra most notable acting performances include &quot;Satyakam&quot; with Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and &quot;Sholay&quot;, which is listed by Indiatimes as one of the &quot;top 25 must see Bollywood films of all time&quot;. In 2005, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded &quot;Sholay&quot; the special distinction of Filmfare Best Film of 50 years.

When Dilip Kumar was giving the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award to Dharmendra, he commented, &quot;Whenever I get to meet with God Almighty, I will set before him my only complaint—why did you not make me as handsome as Dharmendra?&quot;. One of the most successful actors of the 1970s and 1980s, Dharmendra appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top Actors&quot; list eighteen times from 1968 to 1984 and 1987. He topped the list four times (1972-1975).

Dharmendra holds the record for the highest number of hit films in the career of a bollywood actor, surpassing popular actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, and Dilip Kumar. In addition, he also holds the record for having the highest number of hit films in a single year by a bollywood actor, which was seven consecutive hits in 1987, and this makes him one of the greatest actors in the history of Indian cinema.

<text>The Polish government-in-exile, officially known as the Government of the Republic of Poland in exile (), was the government in exile of Poland formed in the aftermath of the Invasion of Poland of September 1939, and the subsequent occupation of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Slovak Republic, which brought to an end the Second Polish Republic.

Despite the occupation of Poland by hostile powers, the government-in-exile exerted considerable influence in Poland during World War II through the structures of the Polish Underground State and its military arm, the Armia Krajowa (Home Army) resistance. Abroad, under the authority of the government-in-exile, Polish military units that had escaped the occupation fought under their own commanders as part of Allied forces in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

After the war, as the Polish territory came under the control of the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic, the government-in-exile remained in existence albeit without effective power. It lost recognition of the majority of states upon formation of the Provisional Government of National Unity on 5 July 1945 though continued to be hosted and informally supported by the United Kingdom, while the last country to withdraw its diplomatic recognition on 19 October 1972 was the Holy See (the Vatican City). However, only after the end of communist rule in Poland did the government-in-exile formally pass its responsibilities and insignia onto the government of the Third Polish Republic at a special ceremony held on 22 December 1990 at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, while the liquidation of its apparatus was declared accomplished on 31 December 1991.

The government-in-exile was based in France during 1939 and 1940, first in Paris and then in Angers. From 1940, following the Fall of France, the government moved to London, and remained in the United Kingdom until its dissolution in 1990.

==History==
===Establishment===
On 17 September 1939, the President of the Polish Republic, Ignacy Mościcki, who was then in the small town of Kuty (now Ukraine) near the southern Polish border, issued a proclamation about his plan to transfer power and appointing Władysław Raczkiewicz, the Marshal of the Senate, as his successor. This was done in accordance with Article 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, adopted in April 1935. Article 24 provided as follows:

It was not until 29 or 30 September 1939 that Mościcki resigned. Raczkiewicz, who was already in Paris, immediately took his constitutional oath at the Polish Embassy and became President of the Republic of Poland. Raczkiewicz then appointed General Władysław Sikorski to be prime minister. After Edward Rydz-Śmigły stepped down, Raczkiewicz also made Sikorski Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces.

Most of the Polish Navy escaped to Britain, and tens of thousands of Polish soldiers and airmen escaped through Hungary and Romania or across the Baltic Sea to continue the fight in France. Many Poles subsequently took part in Allied operations: in Norway (Narvik), in France in 1940 and in 1944, in the Battle of Britain, in the Battle of the Atlantic, in North Africa (notably Tobruk), Italy (notably at Cassino and Ancona), at Arnhem, Wilhelmshaven, and elsewhere.

Under the Sikorski–Mayski agreement of July 1941 Polish soldiers taken prisoner by the Soviet Union in 1939, were released to form Anders&#x27; Army, intended to fight Nazi Germany in the USSR, but instead transferred via Iran to fight with US and British forces. Berling&#x27;s Army, formed in the USSR in 1944, remained there and fought under Soviet command.

===Wartime history===
The Polish government in exile, based first in Paris, then in Angers, France, where Władysław Raczkiewicz lived at the Château de Pignerolle near Angers from 2 December 1939 until June 1940. Escaping from France, the government relocated to London, where it was recognized by all the Allied governments. Politically, it was a coalition of the Polish Peasant Party, the Polish Socialist Party, the Labour Party and the National Party, although these parties maintained only a vestigial existence in the circumstances of war.
When Germany launched a war against the Soviets in 1941, the Polish government in exile established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union against Hitlerism, but also in order to help Poles persecuted by the NKVD. On 12 August 1941 the Kremlin signed a one-time amnesty, extending to thousands of Polish soldiers who had been taken prisoner in 1939 by the Red Army in eastern Poland, including many Polish civilian prisoners and deportees entrapped in Siberia. The amnesty allowed the Poles to create eight military divisions known as the Anders Army. They were evacuated to Iran and the Middle East, where they were desperately needed by the British, hard pressed by Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. These Polish units formed the basis for the Polish II Corps, led by General Władysław Anders, which together with other, earlier-created Polish units fought alongside the Allies.

During the war, especially from 1942 on, the Polish government in exile provided the Allies with some of the earliest and most accurate accounts of the ongoing Holocaust of European Jews and, through its representatives, like the Foreign Minister Count Edward Raczyński and the courier of the Polish Underground movement, Jan Karski, called for action, without success, to stop it. The note the Foreign Minister, Count Edward Raczynski, sent on 10 December 1942 to the Governments of the United Nations was the first official denunciation by any Government of the mass extermination and of the Nazi aim of total extermination of the Jewish population. It was also the first official document singling out the sufferings of European Jews as Jews and not only as citizens of their respective countries of origin. The note of 10 December 1942 and the Polish Government efforts triggered the Declaration of the Allied Nations of 17 December 1942.

In April 1943, the Germans announced that they had discovered at Katyn Wood, near Smolensk, Russia, mass graves of 10,000 Polish officers (the German investigation later found 4,443 bodies) who had been taken prisoner in 1939 and murdered by the Soviets. The Soviet government said that the Germans had fabricated the discovery. The other Allied governments, for diplomatic reasons, formally accepted this; the Polish government in exile refused to do so.

Stalin then severed relations with the Polish government in exile. Since it was clear that it would be the Soviet Union, not the western Allies, who would liberate Poland from the Germans, this breach had fateful consequences for Poland. In an unfortunate coincidence, Sikorski, widely regarded as the most capable of the Polish exile leaders, was killed in an air crash at Gibraltar in July 1943. He was succeeded as head of the Polish government in exile by Stanisław Mikołajczyk.

During 1943 and 1944, the Allied leaders, particularly Winston Churchill, tried to bring about a resumption of talks between Stalin and the Polish government in exile. But these efforts broke down over several matters. One was the Katyń massacre (and others at Kalinin and Kharkiv). Another was Poland&#x27;s postwar borders. Stalin insisted that the territories annexed by the Soviets in 1939, which had millions of Poles in addition to mostly Ukrainian and Belarusian populations, should remain in Soviet hands, and that Poland should be compensated with lands to be annexed from Germany. Mikołajczyk, however, refused to compromise on the question of Poland&#x27;s sovereignty over her prewar eastern territories. A third matter was Mikołajczyk&#x27;s insistence that Stalin would not set up a Communist government in postwar Poland. Mikołajczyk and his colleagues in the Polish government-in-exile insisted on making a stand in the defense of Poland&#x27;s pre-1939 eastern border (retaining its Kresy region) as a basis for the future Polish-Soviet border. However, this was a position that could not be defended in practiceStalin was in occupation of the territory in question. The government-in-exile&#x27;s refusal to accept the proposed new Polish borders infuriated the Allies, particularly Churchill, making them less inclined to oppose Stalin on issues of how Poland&#x27;s postwar government would be structured. In the end, the exiles lost on both issues: Stalin re-annexed the eastern territories, as well as proceeded to impose the communist Polish Committee of National Liberation established on 22 July 1944 by renaming it into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland on 31 December 1944. However, Poland preserved its status as an independent state, despite the arguments of some influential Communists, such as Wanda Wasilewska, in favor of Poland becoming a republic of the Soviet Union. In November 1944, despite his mistrust of the Soviets, Mikołajczyk resigned to return to Poland.

===Provisional Government of National Unity===

On 28 June 1945, Mikołajczyk took office in the Provisional Government of National Unity, a new government established as a result of reshuffling the existing Provisional Government, established under the auspices of the Soviet occupation authorities, through inclusion of his fraction. This provided an excuse for the Western allies to approve tacitly the &quot;fait accompli&quot; of Poland becoming part of the Soviet sphere of influence, and to legitimise the Warsaw government while withdrawing their recognition of the government-in-exile; France did so on 29 June 1945, followed by the United States and United Kingdom on 5 July 1945. The Polish Armed Forces in exile were disbanded in 1945, and most of their members, unable to safely return to Communist Poland, settled in other countries.

Many Polish exiles opposed this action, believing that this government was a façade for the establishment of Communist rule in Poland. This view was later proven correct in 1947 when the Communist-dominated Democratic Bloc won a rigged election. The Communist-dominated bloc was credited with over 80 percent of the vote, a result that was only obtained through large-scale fraud. The opposition claimed it would have won in a landslide (as much as 80 percent, by some estimates) had the election been genuine and Mikołajczyk would have likely become prime minister. In November, at a meeting with the Silesian society, Mikołajczyk was informed that he was to be arrested along with his advisor Paweł Zaleski. The arrest order was already signed. They immediately took the effort to escape. Mikołajczyk headed north, while Zaleski escaped through the southern channel. From the danger zone, Zaleski was taken away in a straw cart. His brother Jan Zaleski from Boyko helped in the escape. Paweł waited a few days with Mikołaj and his father-in-law, Aries of Kamionka in Korfantów near Głuchołazy, before a transfer was arranged. Then through the Czech Republic, Zaleski got to the west, and Mikołajczyk was taken by ship from Szczecin. This was their last stay in Poland.

===Later postwar history===

Meanwhile, the Polish government in exile had maintained its existence. The London Poles had to vacate the Polish embassy on Portland Place and were left only with the president&#x27;s private residence at 43 Eaton Place. The government in exile became largely symbolic of continued resistance to foreign occupation of Poland while retaining some important archives from prewar Poland.

In 1954, political differences led to a split in the ranks of the government in exile. One group, claiming to represent 80% of 500,000 anti-Communist Poles exiled since the war, was opposed to President August Zaleski&#x27;s continuation in office when his seven-year term expired. It formed a Council of National Unity in July 1954, and set up a Council of Three to exercise the functions of head of state, comprising Tomasz Arciszewski, General Władysław Anders, and Edward Raczyński. Only after Zaleski&#x27;s death in 1972 did the two factions reunite. Some supporters of the government in exile eventually returned to Poland, such as Prime Minister Hugon Hanke in 1955 and his predecessor Stanisław Mackiewicz in 1956. The Soviet-installed government in Warsaw campaigned for the return of the exiles, promising decent and dignified employment in communist Polish administration and forgiveness of past transgressions. The Republic of Ireland, Francoist Spain and finally (on 19 October 1972) the Holy See (Vatican City) were the last countries to withdraw recognition of the government-in-exile, though diplomatic privileges had already been withdrawn by Vatican Secretary of State Domenico Tardini in 1959.

Despite these setbacks, the government in exile continued in existence. When Soviet influence over Poland came to an end in 1989, there was still a president and a cabinet of eight, meeting every two weeks in London, commanding the loyalty of about 150,000 Polish veterans and their descendants living in Britain, including 35,000 in London alone.

===Dissolution and recognition in the Third Polish Republic===
Only after the end of communist rule in Poland did the government-in-exile formally pass its responsibilities and insignia onto the government of the Third Polish Republic at a special ceremony held on 22 December 1990 at the Royal Castle in Warsaw where Lech Wałęsa, the first non-Communist president of Poland since the war, received the symbols of the Polish Republic (the presidential banner, the presidential and state seals, the presidential sashes, and the original text of the 1935 Constitution) from the last president of the government in exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski. The liquidation of the London-based government apparatus was declared accomplished on 31 December 1991. In 1992, military medals and other decorations awarded by the government in exile were officially recognized in Poland. The Act on Emoluments of a Former President of the Republic of Poland adopted in 1996 which establishes the rights, privileges, remuneration and other benefits of a former president, awarded them explicitly also to the last President-in-exile.

== Government and politics ==
Towards the end of the Occupation of Poland, on 26 July 1944, the top Cabinet (Executive) of the Polish Underground State was the Home Council of Ministers (), from the Government Delegation for Poland.

<text>A self-adhesive stamp is a postage stamp with a pressure-sensitive adhesive that does not require moistening in order to adhere to paper. They are usually issued on a removable backing paper.

Stamp collectors have criticized the format, because the rubber-based adhesive used tends to yellow the stamps progressively. It makes stamps difficult to remove from covers, and to save in mint condition, though self-adhesives of recent years have improved in these respects.

Artistamps have also been issued in a self-adhesive format.

==First adhesive stamps==
They were first issued by governments in tropical climates such as Sierra Leone in February 1964 and Tonga in April 1969 in an attempt to avoid the tendency of traditional water-activated stamps to stick together in humid conditions. They also made die cutting into fanciful and unique shapes easier.

==In the UK==
The Royal Mail first issued self-adhesive stamps on 19 October 1993, with the introduction of booklets of 20 first class Machin stamps printed by Walsall Security Printers by offset lithography; later a second class stamp was introduced. In the years following, other issues were produced in the self-adhesive format.

Die-cutting tools for the UK self-adhesive stamps were manufactured by Arden Dies of Stockport, Cheshire, using tools designed by Robert Clapham.

==In the US==

The United States Postal Service&#x27;s first foray into self-adhesive stamps was in 1974 with the 10-cent dove weathervane, produced by Avery Dennison, that soon became discolored due to the instability of the adhesive. However, Avery Dennison continued adhesive technology research with pioneering work by M. Shams Tabrez, a chemist. It was in 1989 that another such self adhesive stamp was issued by the USPS. Outside of the philatelic community, the stamps have been welcomed as more convenient; by 2002, virtually all new USPS stamps were issued as self-adhesives.

More recent USPS self-adhesive stamps are not readily removable from the envelope or cover backing by traditional water soaking. Some collectors of used stamps have discovered that although not readily removable by water, the self-adhesives can be removed with Bestine (a heptane solvent), benzine (petroleum ether), or a natural based citrus solvent containing d-limonene (e.g., Pure Citrus Orange is an air freshener product that works for this purpose).

<text>The year 1953 involved numerous significant events in science and technology, including the first description of the DNA double helix, the discovery of neutrinos, and the release of the first polio vaccine.

==Biology==
* February 15 – Linus Pauling proposes a DNA triple helix structure, which is rapidly shown to be incorrect.

* February 28 – Francis Crick and James Watson enter The Eagle, Cambridge, for a pub lunch announcing &quot;We have discovered the secret of life.&quot;
* April 25 – Francis Crick and James D. Watson of the U.K. Medical Research Council&#x27;s Unit for Research on the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems at the Cavendish Laboratory in the University of Cambridge publish &quot;Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid&quot; in the British journal &quot;Nature&quot;. Their work is often ranked as one of the most dramatic biological discoveries of the 20th century, because of the structural beauty and functional logic of the DNA double helix. In 1962, they will share the Nobel Prize in Medicine with Maurice Wilkins, who publishes X-ray crystallography results for DNA in the same issue of &quot;Nature&quot; in 1953. The third related article published at the same time is by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling, on &quot;Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate&quot;.

==Chemistry==
* May 15 – Stanley Miller publishes results from the Miller–Urey experiment in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. These surprise many chemists, by showing that organic molecules present in living organisms can form easily from simple inorganic chemicals.
* Rudolph Pariser, Robert G. Parr and John Pople publish their computational quantum chemistry theory for approximating molecular orbitals.
* Ziegler–Natta catalyst invented by Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta.

==Computer sciences==
* October – UNIVAC 1103 launched.
* Tom Kilburn at the University of Manchester completes a device called MEG, which performs floating-point calculations. This machine evolves into the first transistorized computer, the Metro-Vickers MV950, ultimately leading to the mass production of computers.
* Alan Turing publishes an article describing the first 1,104 zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function, the culmination of fifteen years of work on how to use computers to tackle a fundamental problem in number theory.

==Earth sciences==
* Maurice Ewing and Bruce Heezen discover the deep canyon running along the center of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an important contribution to the theory of plate tectonics.

==Mathematics==
* Klaus Roth publishes a theorem regarded as a milestone in arithmetic combinatorics.

==Medicine and human sciences==
* February 13 – Christine Jorgensen, the first widely known American transsexual, returns to New York after successful sexual reassignment surgery in Denmark.
* March 26 – Jonas Salk announces his polio vaccine.
* May 6 – The first successful open heart surgery on a human utilizing a cardiopulmonary bypass pump (&quot;heart-lung machine&quot;) is performed by John Gibbon at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia when he repairs an atrial septal defect in 18-year-old Cecilia Bavolek.
* July 11 – Andrew Watt Kay publishes his augmented histamine test.
* August 18 – The second of the controversial Kinsey Reports on human sexuality, &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;, is published in the United States.
* September 1 – American neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville performs an experimental segmental resection on Henry Molaison (&quot;H.M.&quot;) at Hartford Hospital (Connecticut) in an attempt to control his severe epilepsy, involving removal of most of H.M.&#x27;s medial temporal lobes on both hemispheres including the hippocampi, amygdalae and entorhinal cortex (the major sensory input to the hippocampi), and rendering him a continuing subject for the study of memory formation and cognitive neuropsychology.
* September 4 – The discovery of REM sleep is first published by researchers Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman of the University of Chicago.
* American scientist Winston Price isolates the first rhinovirus, the most prevalent cause of the common cold.
* Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie and Harry Salzer coin the term &quot;antidepressant&quot;.
* B. F. Skinner publishes the book &quot;Science and Human Behavior&quot;, a controversial attempt to apply the results of behavioral studies of laboratory animals to human psychology.

==Paleontology==
* 20 November – Authorities at the Natural History Museum in London announce that the skull of Piltdown Man (allegedly an early human discovered in 1912) is a hoax.

==Physics==
* Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan perform the first neutrino detection experiments, constructing the first neutrino detector (a cadmium-water target) and using the Hanford Site nuclear facility in Washington state as the neutrino source. This work, first discussed with Enrico Fermi and others in 1951–2, leads to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics.
* Enrico Fermi, John Pasta, Stanislaw Ulam, and Mary Tsingou conduct computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term in what became known as the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou experiment.
* Charles Kittel publishes his influential textbook &quot;Introduction to Solid State Physics&quot; in the United States.

==Technology==
* September 16 – Epic film &quot;The Robe&quot; is released in the United States as the first widescreen anamorphic format movie, filmed in CinemaScope.
* December 17 – The NTSC color television standard is agreed for the United States.
* J. C. Bamford of England introduce the backhoe loader.
* The Jet Propulsion Laboratory completes development of the SSM-A-17 Corporal I rocket. This is the first American surface-to-surface ballistic missile, powered by a liquid-fuelled motor utilizing nitric acid as the oxidizer.

==Events==
* January 13 – &quot;Doctors&#x27; plot&quot;: The state newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; publishes an article alleging that many of the Soviet Union&#x27;s top doctors are part of a major plot to poison the country&#x27;s senior political and military leaders. 
* February 16 – The Pakistan Academy of Sciences is established.
* October 9 – As part of an extended series of publications on science, Pope Pius XII publishes &quot;The Technician&quot;, which instructs scientists to restrict themselves to the study of physical matter and do nothing to undermine the idea of a non-material soul or a Superior Being. &quot;The Technician&quot; is delivered as a papal address on October 9.
* Rudolf Carnap publishes an article called &quot;Testability and Meaning&quot; in &quot;Readings in the Philosophy of Science&quot;, which moves away from the philosophical position of logical positivism with respect to science (particularly the heavily mathematical sciences, such as physics). Carnap instead emphasizes the idea that progress in science depends on the gradual accumulation of many small results that support human understanding of the world, a view more in line with Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s later philosophy and the biological sciences.

<text>A Palestinian suicide bombing occurred on November 21, 2002 in a public bus in the neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem in Jerusalem. 11 people were murdered in the attack and over 50 were injured.

The Palestinian Islamist militant organization Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack.

== The attack ==
On November 21, 2002, at around 7:00 am, Palestinian suicide bomber Na&#x27;el Abu Hilail, wearing an explosives belt packed with five-kilograms of explosives and shrapnel, boarded the public bus on Mexico Street in Jerusalem.

The suicide bomber detonated the explosives in the crowded bus, before the bus reached the next stop, while the bus was in the suburban neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem. 11 people were killed in the attack and over 50 were injured.

== The perpetrators==
Hamas took credit for the attack, which was carried out by Na&#x27;el Abu Hilail, 22, from el-Khader, just south of Bethlehem. Four of the victims were children on their way to school. Abu Hilail&#x27;s father said he was pleased with his son, saying &quot;Our religion says we are proud of him until the day of resurrection.&quot; His friends said he was a supporter of Islamic Jihad.

<doc id="539868" wikidata="Q4756197" url="?curid=539868" title="Andrew Allen (Pennsylvania politician)">
<text>Andrew Allen (June 1740 – March 7, 1825) was a lawyer and official from the Province of Pennsylvania. Born into an influential family, Allen initially favored the colonial cause in the American Revolution, and represented Pennsylvania in the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1776. Like many other wealthy elites in Pennsylvania, however, he resisted radical change, and became a Loyalist after the Declaration of Independence and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.

== Early years ==
Allen was born in June 1740 into a prominent Philadelphia family; his father, William Allen, was a successful merchant and lawyer, and would later be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Andrew graduated from the College of Philadelphia (later named the University of Pennsylvania) in 1759, read law under Benjamin Chew, and then went to London to complete a legal education at the Inner Temple. He returned to Philadelphia in 1765, was admitted to the bar, and began to practice law. That same year Allen was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. In 1766, he was appointed the colony&#x27;s Attorney General. He married Sarah (&quot;Sally&quot;) Coxe, sister of Tench Coxe, in April 1768. During the same year he was granted membership to the American Philosophical Society through his election. In 1770 his brother-in-law, Governor John Penn, gave him a seat on the Governor&#x27;s Council.

== Career ==
When tensions increased before the American Revolution, Allen was one of those critical of the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1774. He signed the non-importation agreement boycotting British goods in protest of the Boston Port Act, and helped form an independent militia unit, the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry, on November 2, 1774. On June 30, 1775, he was appointed to the Committee of Safety by the Assembly.

In 1775 Allen was elected by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. The instructions given to Pennsylvania&#x27;s delegates prohibited them from supporting any measures that would lead to independence from Great Britain. Allen hoped that Congress would seek reconciliation with the mother country, and was dismayed when Congress began moving towards independence in 1776. He resigned from the First City Troop in April of that year. On May 1, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly in a special by-election. The election of moderates like Allen demonstrated that the voting public was still cautious about independence. Radicals in Pennsylvania, however, responded by holding a constitutional convention to create a new constitution and a new, less conservative, General Assembly. When the Continental Congress began considering a resolution of independence in June 1776, Allen withdrew from Congress, not attending any sessions after June 14.

In December 1776, Allen finally switched sides. The situation in Philadelphia had become tense as a British army under General Howe drove George Washington&#x27;s forces out of New York and towards Pennsylvania. In his diary, James Allen, brother of Andrew, described the precarious situation of those Philadelphians who were suspected of being unsympathetic to the Revolution, and how the Allen family reacted:

In 1777 Andrew Allen returned to Philadelphia with General Howe&#x27;s army, but his stay lasted only as long as their occupation, and he returned with them to New York when the British evacuated the city in 1778. From there he made his way to England. Thereafter he practiced law in London.

== Last years ==
The Pennsylvania Assembly attainted Allen of treason in 1781 and confiscated his properties, along with those of others in his family. After the war, the British government reviewed his losses, and the &quot;Commission for Claims and Losses&quot; awarded him a lifetime pension of £400. In 1792, Allen was pardoned by Pennsylvania. He returned to Philadelphia in 1794 to attempt to recover some of the old payments due to him under the provisions of the Jay Treaty, but this was unsuccessful.

He went to London and renewed allegiance and his property was confiscated. He remained there the remainder of his life; he died on March 7, 1825.

<doc id="539881" wikidata="Q2032067" url="?curid=539881" title="Pontiac Grand Prix">
<text>The Grand Prix is a line of automobiles produced by the Pontiac Division of General Motors from 1962 until 2002 as coupes and from 1989 through 2008 model years as four-door sedans.

First introduced as a full-size performance coupe for the 1962 model year, the model repeatedly varied in size, luxury, and performance over successive generations. The Grand Prix was the most expensive coupe Pontiac offered until the 1970s, when the Bonneville Brougham and the Firebird Trans Am became more exclusive; the Grand Prix moved into the intermediate personal luxury car and later the mid-size market segments.

All Grand Prixs from 1962 through 1972 were pillarless hardtops (except for the 1967 convertible).

==First generation (1962–1964)==
The Grand Prix was an all-new model for Pontiac in the 1962 model year as a performance-oriented personal luxury car. Based on the Pontiac Catalina two-door hardtop, Pontiac included unique interior trim with bucket seats and a center console in the front to make the new model a lower-priced entry in the growing personal-luxury segment. The Grand Prix was available with luxury features from the longer, top-line Bonneville coupe. The bucket seats were upholstered in &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. It was also installed with a center console with a transmission shifter, tachometer, four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, and &quot;acceleration&quot; rear axle ratio (3.42:1). It used the Catalina coupe platform with minimal outside chrome trim, and included the &quot;Trophy&quot; version of V8 engine with a three-speed manual transmission or optional console-mounted four-speed manual or Hydra-Matic automatic.

The Grand Prix featured distinctive grille and taillights. It effectively replaced the Pontiac Ventura model while the Catalina was available with an optional &quot;Ventura&quot; trim package for 1962. The rear bench seat included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille that could be made functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features. The listed retail price before optional equipment was $3,490 ($ in dollars ) and was the most expensive model when it was introduced.

The standard engine was the Bonneville&#x27;s V8, which came with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Tri-Power carburation (with three two-barrels) raised output to . Two other high-performance 389s were offered, including a four-barrel version rated at and a Tri-Power. Late in the model year a &quot;street&quot; version of the race-orientated 421 Pontiac offered in 1961 and 1962 became available, but only in a four-barrel form rated at . Pontiac also offered the Super Duty with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at , as a US$2,250 option ($ in dollars ).

John DeLorean, head of Advanced Engineering at Pontiac, contributed to the development of the Grand Prix as well as the GTO.

===1963===
For the 1963 model year, the Grand Prix received revised sheet metal shared with other full-size Pontiacs, but with a squared-off roofline featuring a concave rear window that contrasted with the convertible-like roof styling of the previous year. New was a split grille with vertically stacked headlights and round parking lights as well as &quot;hidden&quot; taillights. Aside from grille work, taillight covering, and bumpers, chrome trim was limited to lower rocker panels, wheel arches, and roofline.

The Grand Prix continued with luxurious interiors featuring real walnut trim on the instrument panel and bucket seats upholstered in &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl. The center console was now built into the instrument panel and featured an intake manifold pressure vacuum gauge along with a dash-mounted tachometer for cars with manual transmission. Pedals received revised custom trim plates. Options included power steering, brakes, windows, and driver&#x27;s seat; air conditioning, eight-lug aluminum wheels with integrated brake drums, and Safe-T-Track differential. New options for this year included an AM/FM radio, cruise control, and a tilt steering wheel adjustable to seven positions.

The 389 four-barrel V8 remained the standard engine. A new lineup of optional engines was introduced this year which included the 389 Tri-Power and three versions of the V8 including a four-barrel version rated at , a Tri-Power option, and the 421 HO option with Tri-Power carburetion and . The same selection of transmissions continued including the standard three-speed manual, optional four-speed manual, or three-speed Roto Hydra-matic. Brakes were drums.

===1964===
The 1964 Grand Prix received minor appearance changes. Those included a revised grille (based on the 1964 Bonneville/Catalina) with new &quot;GP&quot; logos and rear deck trim with new taillights, still hidden, again following the design of the other big 1964 Pontiacs.

Revised upholstery trims highlighted the interior, still featuring expanded &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl bucket seats and console as standard equipment.

Engine offerings were mostly unchanged from 1963 except that the standard 389 four-barrel V8 gained , with the extra-cost Hydramatic transmission. The standard three-speed manual and optional Hydramatic transmissions were unchanged from 1963, however, a new GM-built Muncie four-speed available in either a wide-ratio M-20 or close-ratio M-21 options replaced the Borg-Warner T-10.


==Second generation (1965–1968)==

===1965===
Grand Prix and all other full-sized Pontiacs were completely restyled for 1965 featuring more rounded bodylines with coke-bottle profiles, and a increase in wheelbase to (for Grand Prix, Catalina, and all Safari station wagons — Bonneville and Star Chief increased proportionally from to ). While other Pontiac coupes received the semi-fastback rooflines shared with other GM divisions, Grand Prixs retained the exclusive squared-off roofline with concave rear window but a bit more rounded than the 1963 and 1964 version. This generation also introduced fender skirts over the rear wheels for an upscale look, shared with Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile senior models.

Interiors were revised with new instrument panels featuring more walnut trim which now extended to the center console standard with bucket seats, along with a new steering wheel with horn bars replacing the horn ring used in previous years. The standard bucket seats could be upholstered either in expanded &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl or new cloth-and-&quot;Morrokide&quot; trim. New for 1965 was a no-cost bench seat option with a center armrest available with either upholstery choice. The Grand Prix retained the market position as the most expensive model, offering all equipment offered on the Bonneville hardtop coupe as standard equipment, and had a listed retail price of $3,426 ($ in dollars ).

New options included an automatic air conditioning system called &quot;Comfort Control&quot;. This system, first introduced by Cadillac in 1964, was available in addition to the regular Circ-L-Aire Conditioning. Hazard flashers and seat belts were also optional.

Engine offerings were revised for 1965. The standard four-barrel V8 was uprated to with a manual transmission or with automatic. Optional engines included a 389 Tri-Power and 421 four-barrel — both rated at ; a 421 Tri-Power rated at and the 421 HO Tri-Power with . The standard three-speed and optional four-speed manual transmissions were carried over from 1964, however, a new three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission with torque-converter that was similar in principle to Ford&#x27;s Cruise-O-Matic and Chrysler&#x27;s TorqueFlite replaced the older three-speed fluid coupling Roto Hydramatic (along with the four-speed Super Hydramatic in Bonneville and Star Chief models). The Turbo Hydramatic also featured the now-standardized P-R-N-D-S-L shift quadrant pattern in place of the P-N-D-S-L-R setup of previous Hydramatics.

A 1965 Grand Prix road test was featured in the February 1965 issue of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine, which was focused on the entire Pontiac lineup receiving M/T &quot;Car of the Year&quot; honors for 1965. Other Pontiac road tests in that issue included a GTO convertible, Tempest Custom sedan, Catalina Vista hardtop sedan, and Bonneville hardtop coupe.

===1966===
The 1966 Grand Prix received only minor appearance revisions including a new more rounded split grille and new taillight trim. Inside, a revised instrument panel included a squared-off gauge panel and new Strato bucket seats in either &quot;Morrokide&quot; or cloth upholstery with higher seatbacks and more contoured cushions for improved lateral support. The Strato buckets were standard equipment along with a console, but a notchback bench seat with a center armrest was a no-cost option.

Engine offerings were largely unchanged from 1965 except that the Tri-Power 389 option was discontinued, leaving only the larger 421 available with the three two-barrel carb option, which was offered for the last time this year due to a new General Motors edict that banned the use of multi-carb options on all GM cars with the exception of the Chevrolet Corvette starting with the 1967 model year.

===1967===
Revised sheet metal with rounded yet even more pronounced Coke bottle styling highlighted the 1967 Grand Prix and other full-sized Pontiacs. A convertible was new; this lasted only for the 1967 model year. Also new to the G.P.-concealed headlights with horizontal mounting (all other full-size 1967 Pontiacs retained the vertical headlights for one more year), concealed windshield wipers, and ventless front windows on hardtop coupes. The louvered taillights were similar to those found on the GTO.

&quot;Strato&quot; bucket seats and console were standard equipment with &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl or cloth upholstery, or a no-cost optional notchback bench seat with either trims. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and door panel trim.

The 389 V8 was replaced by a new V8 with four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts and . Similarly, the 421 V8 was replaced by a new V8 rated at or an HO version with - both with four-barrel carburetors. Both the 400 and 428 V8s were basically bored out versions of the older 389/421 block but with various internal improvements including bigger valves and improved breathing capabilities.

New this year was a dual master-cylinder braking system and optional front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing collapsible steering column. Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo tape player.

===1968===

The 1968 Grand Prix received a more pronounced &quot;beak-nose&quot; grille in shock-absorbent plastic and a new front bumper. The concealed headlights were carried over, and a revised rear deck/bumper with L-shaped taillights and side reflector markers to meet a new federal safety mandate were new. The convertible was discontinued, leaving only the hardtop coupe for 1968.

The standard V8 was revised to meet the new 1968 Federal and California emission regulations. Both optional V8s received higher power ratings of for the base version and the HO.

The interior trim only received minor changes from 1967 aside from revised door panels.

This would be the final year for the B-bodied, full-sized Grand Prix. The 1969 GP would feature a new body using a chassis based on the shorter Pontiac A-body intermediates.

==Third generation (1969–1972)==
For the 1969 model year, Pontiac&#x27;s general manager John Z. DeLorean ordered the development of an all-new Grand Prix. It featured new bodywork with a pronounced grille, and rode on a stretched version of the intermediate GM A platform and introduced as the G-Body.

=== Development ===

The new intermediate-based 1969 Grand Prix began to take shape in April 1967, with a few prototype models built on the full-sized Pontiac platform before the G-Body was ready. To save both development costs and time in much the same manner Chevrolet created the original Chevrolet Camaro using the basic chassis and drivetrain from the compact Chevrolet Chevy II, the revised Grand Prix would have a unique bodyshell and ride on the intermediate A-body stretched 6”, and share mechanicals with the Tempest, Le Mans and GTO. This reduced development time from the usual 36 months required for a new model to less than 18 , allowing Pontiac to concentrate on upgrading styling and interior appointments.

Shortened by three inches from the previous Catalina wheelbase, the 1969 Grand Prix finally had a unique body – and Pontiac&#x27;s longest-ever hood. Like all but the short-lived 1967 convertible, the new Grand Prix was a 2-door hardtop. Model names borrowed suggestive Duesenberg Model SJ nomenclature for the exclusive &quot;SJ&quot; trim package and the prominent grille. The basic 1969 body shell saw a major facelift in 1971 bracketed by minor detail revisions in the 1970 and 1972 model years.

===1969===
The new Grand Prix sought to deliver performance as attention-getting as its styling, with manual transmission options and engines topping out at the 428 HO. 

Two engines were offered with two power options each; a or , and a or V8. The 1969 Grand Prix debuted a &quot;Command Seat&quot; wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel that placed most controls and gauges within easy reach of the driver.

Enhancing the interior&#x27;s sporty look, the &quot;Strato&quot; bucket seats were separated by a console integrated into the instrument panel that slanted toward the driver, which included a floor shifter, storage compartment, and ashtray. A leather trim option which also replaced nylon loop rug with cut-pile carpeting was finally offered in addition to the &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl and cloth and &quot;Morrokide&quot; upholstery offerings. Innovations in 1969 included a radio antenna embedded in the windshield, flush-mounted &quot;pop-open&quot; exterior door handles, side-impact beams inside the doors, and an optional built-in electrically heated rear window defogger. The listed retail price with the optional &quot;SJ&quot; trim package was $4,182 ($ in dollars ), keeping a higher price over the Bonneville hardtop coupe but was now less expensive than the GTO &quot;Judge&quot; convertible.

Also in 1969, Pontiac built a steam powered SE 101 concept car with a engine designed by GM engineering in conjunction with the Besler brothers. The engine, however, was heavier than a V8, and three times more expensive to make.

====Market====
DeLorean and other Pontiac planners saw a way to reverse the declining sales of the full-sized Grand Prix by creating a new niche in the burgeoning personal luxury car market. Smaller than the E-bodied Cadillac Eldorado, Buick Riviera, and Oldsmobile Toronado, it was positioned with the considerably smaller yet Ford Thunderbird (and above the Mercury Cougar XR-7 &quot;Pony car&quot; and the B-bodied Dodge Charger intermediate).

Sales reached over 112,000 units, almost quadruple the 32,000 full-sized models built in 1968. The similar but less luxurious Chevrolet Monte Carlo followed in 1970. Ford and Chrysler responded by producing plusher versions of their intermediate Torino and Charger, but both eventually created newer entries to the intermediate personal luxury car battle—the Ford Elite in 1974 and Chrysler Cordoba in 1975.

===1970===
Vertical grille inserts replaced the horizontal bars of the 1969, movement of &quot;Grand Prix&quot; nameplates from the lower cowls to the rear C-pillars and the vertical chromed louvers from the C-pillars down to the lower cowls, highlighted the 1970 Grand Prix. The optional V8 rated at 370 and in 1969 was replaced by a new with of torque at 3,100 rpm. The base 350 hp engine was still standard, but a low-compression 400 CID engine was available with a two-barrel carburetor. An automatic transmission was offered as a no cost option.

Interior trim also received minor revisions, and a bench seat with center armrest returned as a no-cost option to the standard Strato bucket seats and console. Bench seat-equipped cars included a steering column-mounted shifter with the automatic transmission along with a dashboard-mounted glovebox, replacing the console-mounted shifter and glovebox of bucket-seat cars. Power front disc brakes became standard equipment this year.

Due to the success of the 1969 Grand Prix, other GM divisions followed suit and introduced similar cars for 1970. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo used the same basic G-body as the GP but with a two-inch shorter wheelbase (116 vs. the GP&#x27;s 118) and a long hood, though still shorter than the Grand Prix&#x27;s, but still considered an upscale vehicle for GM&#x27;s lowest-priced division. Oldsmobile, whose larger and more expensive front-drive Toronado was a direct competitor to the Thunderbird, decided to further capitalize on strong sales of its intermediate Cutlass line by introducing a new Cutlass Supreme coupe with a formal roofline similar to the GPs but on the standard wheelbase used for two-door A-body intermediates and the same lower sheet metal used on other Cutlass models. Both the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme were also much lower in price, primarily due to smaller standard engines for both, and that many items standard on the GP were optional on those models — however, all three cars with similar equipment were actually much closer in price than the base sticker prices suggest. The introduction of the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme did, however, cut into the Grand Prix&#x27;s dominance, and sales dropped 40%. A total of 65,750 Grand Prixs were made in 1970.

Variations of the 1969 GP&#x27;s central V-nose grille appeared on other 1970 Pontiacs including the full-sized cars and intermediate Tempest/Le Mans series. The 1970 Ford Thunderbird styling change was reportedly ordered by Ford Motor president Semon Knudsen, who moved from GM to Ford in 1968 after a long career at GM which included the position of general manager for the Pontiac Motor Division from 1956 until 1961, and was responsible for adding the Grand Prix to the 1962 Pontiac line.

===1971===

A new integrated bumper/grille and larger single headlights replacing the quad lights of 1969-70 models marked the introduction of the 1971 Grand Prix along with a new slanted boattail-style rear with taillights built into the bumper. Interior revisions amounted to new trim patterns for cloth and vinyl upholstery patterns for both the bench and bucket seats, but the leather interior option was discontinued.

Engine choices included the standard V8 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts, rated at ; and the optional four-barrel V8 rated at . Both engines received substantially lower compression ratios (8.4:1 for 1971 compared to 10.25:1 in 1970) as part of a GM-corporate requirement for engines to use lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline beginning with the 1971 model year. Transmission offerings initially were carried over from previous years, including the standard three-speed manual, or optional four-speed stick or Turbo Hydra-Matic. However, at mid-year, Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic became standard equipment and the manual shifters were dropped. Variable-ratio power steering was made standard equipment as well.

New power ratings were put into effect, requiring manufacturers to post net horsepower with all accessories installed (vs. gross rating without the accessories). This system gave a more realistic measure of power. The base four-barrel engine was rated now at and the in SJ models were (net). The 455 SJ model had a $195 option that included Rally gauges, body-colored mirrors, SJ badging, and a no-maintenance AC Delco battery. A corporate-wide labor strike in mid-September 1970 halted all GM production for 67 days. This delayed the production of the third generation Grand Prix by one year in 1973. Production numbers for 1971 were lower than in 1970 with only 58,325 units.

===1972===

Minor styling revisions included a new cross-hatch grille up front and triple cluster taillights in the back. Inside, the burled-elm trim was replaced by a new teakwood design, and upholstery trim patterns for vinyl and cloth selections were revised for both bucket and bench seat offerings. Engine offerings remained the same as before with the major change being the change in power measurements from the previous gross method on a dynamometer to the new net ratings as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission equipment which made the horsepower ratings of 1972 models lower than their 1971 counterparts though actual performance did not change much between the two years. Under the net horsepower measurement system, the standard V8 with four-barrel carburetor was rated at while the optional with four-barrel carb was rated at .

At mid-year, Pontiac released a radial tire option for the Grand Prix, which increased the wheel diameter from the standard to . This was the first time that Pontiac offered a radial tire option for the entire model year. In 1968, Pontiac announced a radial tire option for the GTO that was quickly discontinued due to production problems.

Also at mid-year, a new &quot;Fasten Seat Belts&quot; light with buzzer was added per Federal safety regulation. This light was located in the speedometer pod and the speedometer was changed from displaying a high of , back to .

An all-new Grand Prix was scheduled for 1972. However, a 67-day corporate-wide strike at GM in late 1970 that hobbled the 1971 model introduction set back 1972 model production plans, and the new A and G-body cars planned for 1972 were delayed for introduction by one year to the 1973 model year. Production numbers increased after two years of decline, reaching 91,961 units and only second place to the 1969 model.

== Fourth generation (1973–1977)==

All A-bodies, including the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, the performance was on the decline due to new emissions control systems. The most notable styling feature of this generation was the appearance of the fixed opera window, replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year&#x27;s Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared &quot;Colonnade&quot; hardtop with frameless door glass as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding roll-over protection.

The front and rear styling of the 1973 Grand Prix was an evolution of the 1971 and 1972 models with a vertical-bar V-nose grille and single headlamps along with the new federally mandated 5 mph (8 km/h) front bumper. The rear featured a revised boattail-like trim with square-taillights above the bumper.

A new instrument panel continued the wraparound cockpit theme of previous models with new African Crossfire Mahogany facing on the dashboard, console, and door panels, which was genuine wood in contrast with the simulated woodgrain material found in most car interiors during that time. The Strato bucket seats were completely new with higher seatbacks and integrated headrests in &quot;Morrokide&quot; or cloth trims, and optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support, with a notchback bench seat offered as a no-cost option.

The standard drivetrain consisted of the four-barrel V8 rated at and the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission. Also standard were power steering and power brakes. A four-barrel was optional and included with the &quot;SJ&quot; option that also added a rally gauge cluster and a radial tuned suspension with front and rear sway bars, Pliacell shock absorbers, and radial-ply tires. The introduction of radial-ply tires improved handling. GM&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; body cars&#x27; front suspensions were based on the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird during this production run.

The Grand Prix continued its top level designation as Pontiac&#x27;s most exclusive product, with the &quot;SJ&quot; option package listed for $4,962 ($ in dollars ) while the standard Grand Prix was listed at $4,583 ($ in dollars ).

Grand Prix production set a new record of over 150,000 units, despite intense competition from a similar restyled Chevy Monte Carlo, and &quot;near&quot; personal luxury coupes such as Buick&#x27;s all-new Century Regal and Oldsmobile&#x27;s Cutlass Supreme — both of whose styling and appointments were very similar to the GP and Monte Carlo, and even shared the same squared-off formal roofline with opera windows - but used the standard A-body coupe body and wheelbase shared with lower-priced models. The success of the GP (and Monte Carlo) led to direct responses from Ford Motor Company the following year with a larger Ford Elite and Mercury Cougar, which were followed by Chrysler entries in 1975, the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba.

===1974===
The 1974 Grand Prix received a revised split grille with vertical bars that was entirely above the bumper. The boattail effect was softened due to a new federally mandated bumper that was added to the similar mandated front bumper introduced in 1973. The license plate and fuel filler were moved above the bumper and taillight lenses were revised.

The interior trim remained virtually unchanged from 1973, with standard seating choices, including Strato bucket seats with center console or notchback bench seat with an armrest and cloth or &quot;Morrokide&quot; upholstery. The bucket seats were available with optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support. The real African Crossfire Mahogany trim was replaced by a simulated material for the instrument panel due to splintering problems on 1973 models; the &quot;real&quot; wood was continued on the console and door panels for another two years. A new cut-pile carpeting replaced the nylon loop rugs of previous years.

A federally mandated interlock system required the driver and front-seat passenger to fasten their seat belts to start the car. This system was offered only for 1974 and on some early 1975 models. It was rescinded by Congressional action.

Engines were carried over from 1973, including the V8 which was standard on the new &quot;Model J&quot; trim package, and which was standard on the &quot;Model SJ&quot;, and optional on the &quot;Model J&quot;. A Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, and power brakes were standard equipment on both models. In addition to the 455 V8, the &quot;Model SJ&quot; also added a Rally Gauge Cluster, &quot;SJ&quot; identification, and a radial-tuned suspension similar to Pontiac&#x27;s Grand Am. Radial tires were also a new option on the &quot;Model J&quot; this year.

Sales of Grand Prixs for the 1974 model year dropped from 1973&#x27;s record of around 150,000 units to just under 100,000 units primarily due to new competition in the intermediate personal-luxury car market from a new upsized Mercury Cougar XR-7 coupe and Ford Elite, both based on the Dearborn&#x27;s intermediate Torino/Montego platform. Still, 1974 was the third best-selling year to date for the Pontiac Grand Prix.

===1975===

A revised grille with fewer vertical bars and revised taillight lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included the addition of GM&#x27;s High Energy electronic ignition and a catalytic converter that mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Radial tires became standard on all models.

A new luxury LJ model was added as the new top model. The base Model J remained available, as well as the SJ. The LJ included pinstriping and a velour interior trim. Speedometers were revised with numerals now topping at rather than the 120 or readings found in previous years and speed readings in kilometers were added.

The addition of the catalytic converter spelled the end of dual exhaust for 1975 and detuning of engines. The V8 (standard on J and LJ models) dropped from 230 to while the (standard on SJ, optional on J and LJ) was detuned from 250 to . New for 1975 was a more economical with two-barrel carburetor, which was available as a no-cost option on J and LJ models.

Sales dropped to 86,582 units thanks to an aging design, continued recession resulting from the 1973-74 energy crisis, substantially higher prices for all 1975-model cars due to that year&#x27;s safety and emission control regulations, and intense competition from Ford&#x27;s Cougar and Elite, and Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s two new entries in this class including the Chrysler Cordoba and Dodge Charger SE.

The model mix was 64,581 base J models, 7,146 SJs, and 14,855 of the new LJ.

===1976===
A new split vertical bar &quot;waterfall&quot; grille and quad rectangular headlights in front and revised taillight lenses highlighted the 1976 Grand Prix. The same three model designations continued (J, SJ, and LJ) with the LJ and SJ offering the same trim and equipment levels as in 1975 with the exception being the SJ downgraded to a standard V8.

The base Model J underwent a number of content changes to cut the base price by around $500 to be more competitive with other mid-sized personal luxury cars. Those changes for the &quot;J&quot; included a smaller V8 as the base powerplant and some downgrading of interior trim that included a new notchback bench seat made standard equipment and the Strato bucket seats/console became optional. Features such as a cushioned steering wheel and custom pedal trim plates became optional on Model J, but remained standard on LJ and SJ, both of which also continued to include Strato bucket seats as standard equipment. All models got a new simulated rosewood trim for the dash, door panels, and console (with bucket seats) that replaced the African Crossfire Mahogany trim of previous years. Upholstery choices included cloth or &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl bench or bucket seats on the Model J, velour buckets on the LJ, or &quot;Morrokide&quot; buckets on the SJ. Leather interior trim was a new extra-cost option available with the Strato bucket seats and LJ and SJ models. Both the &quot;LJ&quot; and &quot;SJ&quot; models came standard with a V8 that was optional on the Model J. The was optional on all models.

In celebration of Pontiac&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1976, a number of special edition Grand Prix were produced. Technically a LJ trim option, these models featured removable Hurst T-tops, color-keyed Rally II wheels, special &quot;Anniversary Gold&quot; paint (actually the new Cadillac Seville&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Gold) accented by a white opera roof and white side protection. The only available interior color was Light Buckskin. Among the other distinctions was special badging with Golden hood and trunk medallions and a Golden &quot;arrow head&quot; logo in the steering wheel. Buyers could opt for other accessories available for the LJ. Many chose sport instrumentation, sport steering wheels, or leather upholstery. Mechanically, they were similar to the regular models. This was one of two anniversary models offered by Pontiac, the other was a special trim Firebird.

Grand Prix production increased: sales went up to 228,091 units total (a plus of 226%), making this Bicentennial year the best in Grand Prix&#x27; history — and second in its class only to the Chevrolet Monte Carlo with 353,272 units. This included 110,814 base model Js, 88,232 SJs, and 29,045 LJs (including 4,807 Golden Anniversary editions and a single demonstrator with Pontiac&#x27;s not yet introduced V8 engine.

===1977===
A complete reworking of the front header and bumper highlighted the 1977 Grand Prix, which was the final year for the 1973-vintage bodyshell that was set to be replaced by a downsized GP for 1978. The parking lamps were now positioned between the quad headlamps (same setup as a 1967 or 1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass), and the previous year&#x27;s &#x27;waterfall&#x27; grille was replaced by a narrower one that extended into the lower portion of the bumper. Behind the bumper were new reinforcements (mounting panels) made from aluminum rather than steel to reduce weight. In back the taillights were simplified to eliminate the weighty pot metal bezels that created the horizontal stripe effect in 1976. The same three models (J, LJ, and SJ) were carried over with engine revisions. The base Model J got Pontiac&#x27;s new V8 as standard equipment, which was much too small and underpowered to propel a 4,000-pound car. Optional engines included a V8 or ; those two engines standard on the LJ and SJ models, respectively. The original thinking on the 301 CID engine was that the weight savings from using a significantly lighter engine would cancel out the horsepower loss from the smaller displacement. This turned out to be a major miscalculation and 301 equipped cars became much less desirable among Grand Prix enthusiasts and collectors in later years. The 301 also had a knocking (pre-ignition) problem that was later determined to be caused by the shape of the combustion chamber.

Each of those engines were Pontiac-built units as in previous years, but offered in 49 of the 50 states. Because Pontiac&#x27;s own V8 engines could not meet the more stringent California emission standards set for 1977, all Grand Prixs (and other Pontiac models) sold in California were powered by Oldsmobile-built engines including Lansing&#x27;s &quot;Rocket V8&quot; for J and LJ, and the Rocket V8 standard on the SJ and optional on the other two GPs in California. Due to a shortage of Olds 350 engines resulting from record sales of Cutlasses and reduced production of that engine due to a plant conversion to build a Diesel V8 beginning in 1978, a few 1977 Grand Prixs destined for California reportedly came off the line with a Chevrolet-built V8.

Grand Prix sales increased to an all-time high of over 270,000 units for 1977, the last year for this bodystyle, despite competition from a newly downsized and lower-priced Ford Thunderbird introduced this year and a restyled Mercury Cougar XR-7 whose bodyshell switched to the T-Bird this year from the discontinued Ford Torino/Mercury Montego.

==Fifth generation (1978–1987)==
1978 brought a downsizing of the Grand Prix and the other A-bodies. The 1978 GP was about shorter and lighter than the 1977 model with an overall length of and a wheelbase.

For the first time in Grand Prix history, a V8 engine was not standard equipment. In order to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) mandates set after 1973-74 energy crisis, a Buick-built V6 was standard equipment on the base model (formerly the Model J) and two versions of the Pontiac V8 (Chevy V8 in California) were optional. The luxury LJ model came standard with the 301 V8 with two-barrel carburetor while the sporty SJ was powered by a 301 V8 with four-barrel carburetor. Top speed for the six-cylinder was about , while the top-of-the-line V8 was .

A floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment with the V6 on the base model and the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic was optional. Turbo Hydra-Matic was standard on LJ and SJ models and base models with either of the optional V8 engines. Standard seating choices by model included a notchback bench seat with cloth or &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl in the base GP, a pillowed velour cloth notchback bench seat in the LJ, or Strato bucket seats in cloth or &quot;Morrokide&quot; in the SJ. The Strato buckets were optional on the base GP and a 60/40 split-bench was optional on both base and LJ models. Viscount leather upholstery was available with bucket seats on SJ models.

===1979===

A new crosshatch grille and revised taillight lenses were the only appearance changes made to the 1979 Grand Prix. The same models, base, LJ and SJ continued as before as did the basic engine lineup including the Buick V6 standard on base and LJ models, the Pontiac V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was optional on both of those models, and the 301 V8 with four-barrel carburetion that was standard on the SJ and optional on the other models. Transmissions remained the same as before with the three-speed manual standard with the V6 engine on the base model and automatic transmission optional. The automatic transmission was standard on LJ and SJ models and all models when a V8 engine was ordered. Again, the Pontiac V8s were not available in California, where they were replaced by Chevy rated at 140 and . A new and one-year-only option this year was a four-speed manual transmission available with the four-barrel or two-barrel V8 on all models. Only 232 4-speed/301 V8 cars were built.

===1980===
The 1980 Grand Prix returned to a vertical bar grille and featured new taillight lenses with &quot;GP&quot; logos. Automatic transmission was standard equipment on all models and the two-barrel Pontiac V8 was replaced by a new V8 rated at . The Buick 231 V6 and the four-barrel version of the Pontiac 301 V8 were carried over from the previous year as was the Chevy 305 V8 offered in California.

===1981===
A minor reskinning of the sheet metal for improved aerodynamics marked the 1981 Grand Prix along with a new grille design and revised tail section. The SJ model was dropped and a new Brougham series was now the flagship of the Grand Prix line. The Brougham models came standard with all power options, a plush cloth interior similar to the full-sized Bonneville Brougham, and a half roof vinyl top with coach lamps. The base and LJ models continued as before. All models now came standard with the Buick V6 with the Pontiac V8 available as an extra cost option (Chevy V8 in California). The V8 was discontinued and a new option this year was the Oldsmobile-built Diesel V8, which was not often ordered due to high cost of around $700 and poor reliability. The year 1981 was also the last for Pontiac Motor Division to offer its V8 engine due to an emerging GM corporate engine policy that determined Pontiac would build only four-cylinder engines and Buick only V6 engines, leaving Chevrolet and Oldsmobile to build V8 engines for most GM cars and trucks, while Cadillac would produce an aluminum-block V8 that debuted in 1982. From 1982-on, all V8-equipped Pontiacs were equipped with Chevy or Olds engines.

===1982===
The 1982 Grand Prix was a virtual rerun of the 1981 model with no appearance changes to note. No gasoline-powered V8 engines were offered this year (in the U.S. only — Canadian GPs were available with the Chevy 305 V8 as an option in &#x27;82), leaving only the standard Buick V6, a larger Buick V6 and the Olds Diesel V8. The A-body line became front-wheel-drive, leaving the rear-wheel-drive midsize platform as the G-body. The downsized four-door Bonneville was now related to the Grand Prix. The automatic climate control option was also dropped in 1981, leaving just manual climate control on all models. Most 1982 models had a two tone interior. Front suspension was independent with wishbones, coil springs, antiroll bars, and telescopic shocks while the rear still had a live axle.

===1983===
1983 Grand Prix models specifically had no hood ornament and trim, and no rear trunk lock cover. One significant engine change to note was the V6 was discontinued and the gas-powered V8 returned after a one-year absence (on U.S. models) in the form of a Chevy . 1983 also marked the end of the LJ series, as the LE model would be added in for the 1984 model year.

===1984===
Some minor changes and revisions marked the 1984 Grand Prix, including the return of the octagonal Pontiac hood ornament (which originally debuted in 1976), gauges with orange needles and red markings (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prix gauges had white needles), a T-shaped console shifter, an updated bucket seat design, as well as a woodgrain plate above the glove box (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prixs used a black plate). A new optional four-spoke steering wheel was also available. The base and Brougham models continued as before but the LJ was replaced by a new LE model. Same engines continued as before including the Buick V6, Chevy V8 and Olds Diesel V8. A new option this year was the Turbo Hydra-Matic 200-4R four-speed overdrive automatic available with the 305 V8 for improved highway gas mileage.

===1985===
For 1985, Grand Prix&#x27;s now included a new checkerboard grille design, as well as an optional two-tone paint scheme with a fading body stripe. The octagonal &#x27;GP&#x27; logo also returned to the taillights. 1985 marked the last year for the flat rear deck panel in the interior, as by 1986 laws mandated cars to have a third brake light installed. New rectangular digital ETR stereo system options were introduced and replaced the dial pushbutton stereos. Options specific for the 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix include a factory rear spoiler, rare aluminum turbo finned wheels, and a full-size spare tire. The standard engine for 1985 was the Buick built 3.8 L V6 with a Chevy 5.0 L V8 optional. The 5.7 L Olds Diesel V8 was dropped from the option list. Equipment levels were Standard, LE, and Brougham.

An ad for the 1985 GP promoted the fact that its instrument panel still used dials for gauges. It was highlighted by a question similar to one long used in advertisements for Dial soap since the late 1950s, &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad We Use Dials. Don&#x27;t You Wish Everybody Did?&quot;

===1986===

An updated taillight design with three sections was the only major change to the 1986 Grand Prix. A new 2+2 model was offered for homologation of an aerodynamic coupe body for NASCAR competition, like Chevrolet&#x27;s 1986 Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe. (Pontiac never used the term &quot;Aerocoupe&quot;). The 2+2-specific pieces are an aero nose, bubble rear glass and a fiberglass trunk lid with an integral spoiler. All 2+2 models came equipped with a corporate four-barrel engine, the 200-4R four-speed automatic transmission and 3.08:1 rear axle ratio. They have a two-tone paint job with silver on top and gray on the bottom, with 2+2 decals and striping and 15x7 steel Rally II wheels. Modestly successful on superspeedways, where its bulbous rear end earned it a nickname of &quot;the whale&quot;, the 2+2 design was seriously flawed for street use. Since the enormous rear glass was fixed (not an opening hatch), it forced the adoption of a dramatically shortened trunk opening. Although it had modest horsepower, benign handling, and design compromises, there were only 1,118 Grand Prix 2+2s built in 1986 and dealers were able to ask 20 percent above the list price for this limited-production version. The cars were all allotted to dealers in the Southeastern United States.

While the 3.8 L V6 remained standard for the regular Grand Prix, a fuel-injected 4.3 L Chevrolet 90° V6 was added to the options list for models other than the 2+2. This engine was available with a three-speed or a four-speed automatic transmission.

===1987===
The 1987 Grand Prix was basically a rerun of the 1986 model aside from the discontinuation of the 2+2 model. The same three models were continued including base, LE, and Brougham. Engine offerings again included the standard Buick 3.8 L V6, the Chevrolet 4.3 L V6, or optional Chevrolet 5.0 L V8.

This would be the last year for the G-body Grand Prix, which would be replaced by the all-new W-body version in 1988. The 1987 model year was also the last Grand Prix to feature a V8 engine (until late-2005), and separate body-on-frame construction.

==Sixth generation (1988–1996)==


The first front-wheel drive W-body Grand Prix coupes were built in October 1987, and released on January 12, 1988, for the 1988 model year. This generation Grand Prix was built in Kansas City, Kansas. The Grand Prix was introduced as base, LE and SE coupes. All featured GM&#x27;s MPFI 2.8 L V6 that made and of torque. A five-speed manual or four-speed automatic were the transmissions offered. The LE was well equipped with power windows and door locks and a digital dashboard with an analog tachometer. SE models upgraded with power front seats with multiple lumbar, side bolsters, side wing adjustments, an AM/FM Cassette stereo, and a trip computer and compass located in the center of the dash. Some models of this generation have the rare feature of a split front bench seat with a column shifter. Another unique feature only found on the Grand Prix is the combination lock for the glove box, rather than a key. Grand Prix was Motor Trend&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1988.

===1989===
A host of changes upgraded the Grand Prix for 1989 including for the first time optional anti-lock brakes. Air conditioning was standard as were rear shoulder belts, and the 2.8 L was replaced by GM&#x27;s new 3.1 L MPFI V6 that produced midway through the model year. For 1989, the 3.1 L was only mated to a four-speed automatic transmission, while the remaining 2.8 was mated to either manual or automatic transmissions. The coupe was an SE model with body work such as hood louvers and extra body cladding (which would be the most controversial design element in the years to come). The interior featured more equipment, and only seated four, in contrast to the LE&#x27;s five seats, which was a revival of the Pontiac 2+2 from the mid-1960s. The full analog gauges would become the 1990-93 sports cluster, and the basis for the new instrument cluster to replace the digital cluster for 1990.

A new trim level was offered for 1989, a limited-edition turbo coupe that featured an ASC/McLaren turbocharged version of GM&#x27;s 3.1 L V6 (Only 749 were produced). Output was , 65 more than the previous year. A four-speed automatic was the only transmission offered.

===1990===
In 1990, the base model was dropped in favor of a sedan version (replacing the 6000 which ended production the next year and the Canada-only Tempest), entering production on September 12, 1989. A notable introduction for the Grand Prix in 1990 is the new STE (Special Touring Edition) which replaced the STE model of the Pontiac 6000. In contrast to that model, it trades in all-wheel-drive for the available Turbo 3.1 L V6. Standard features include a cassette stereo with equalizer and eight speakers (a compact disc player was optional), remote keyless entry, eight-way power driver&#x27;s seat with multiple lumbar and sidewing adjustments for both front seat occupants, and a compass/trip computer that was more informative than the units in the SE and turbo coupes. An LE sedan was also available for 1990, standard with a 2.3 L Quad 4 engine and a 3-speed automatic, the first use of an inline 4 cylinder engine in a Grand Prix. The 2.8 L V6 engine was discontinued, while the 3.1 L engine gained widespread availability and a standard five-speed manual transmission. The STE sedan also offered a light bar between the halogen headlights that did not function as daytime running lights.

===1991===
For 1991, the Grand Prix Turbo coupe was replaced by a new GTP version. This model sported a 3.4 L DOHC V6 that produced with a five-speed manual transmission or 200 with the optional four-speed automatic. Inside, the GTP was essentially the same as the Turbo. One notable exception was the available optional Heads Up Display only shared with the Cutlass Supreme. The exterior used mini-quad headlamps (along with all other Grand Prix coupes), &quot;GTP Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;24 Valve V6&quot; badges. The STE Turbo was replaced by a 3.4 L STE and could be ordered with the automatic transmission or manual transmission. For the SE coupe, the B4U package featured GTP bodywork and aluminum wheels. An SE sedan also became available and featured STE-like styling at a lower price. The LE coupe was discontinued for 1991.

===1992===
Anti-lock brakes (ABS) is optional on all models for 1992, the 2.3 L Quad 4 engine was dropped, and the LE sedan gained the SE/STE front lightbar. Most LE Sedans ordered for rental fleets had full power options. A special edition only for 1992 was &quot;Richard Petty Edition&quot; of only 1000 units. This edition featured a special red, white or blue paint, the 210 hp Chevy LQ1 3.4l DOHC, special badging featuring Richard Petty&#x27;s signature, special wheel well and ground effects, spoiler, Richard Petty black and white center caps, transmission shift modification which allowed a button for 2nd gear start or normal use, combination locking glove box, blue paint on the inner web on wheel matching exterior paint, and &quot;fan appreciation tour&quot; badging making it one of the rarest Grand Prix ever produced.

===1993===
This was the last year of the old-style B4U bodykit. There was a special edition model with metallic green paint, as well as gold wheels and pinstriping. It was also the last year that a manual transmission could be ordered as an option. This was also the last year for the style of the dashboard used 1988–1993.
===1994===
For 1994, Grand Prix went through a mid-generation &quot;facelift&quot; inside and out, as well as a reshuffling of the lineup. First, LE and STE models were discontinued. The GT and GTP became option packages on the SE sedan and coupe, respectively. These option packages included the revised 3.4 L V6, sport suspension, ground effects. Outside, there was a new front and rear fascia and new ground effects. Inside, a new instrument panel hosted dual airbags, much larger and easier to use controls, and seatbelts were moved to the B-pillars rather than the doors on sedans only; coupes retained the automatic seatbelt design. Under the hood, the 3.1 L V6 was changed to the 3100 SFI V6 with , while the 3.4 L V6 had . The Grand Prix Sedan also had a slight tail light revision using the amber over red pattern as opposed to the red over amber in years past; however, the coupe&#x27;s tail lights remained the same. Mirrors on some models were painted in body color.

===1995-1996===
For 1996 the center console on floor shift models received a minor redesign. This was also the last year for the BYP body cladding package. The 3.4 L DOHC V6 gained with intake and exhaust improvements. All Grand Prix coupes received a sport package with five-spoke alloy wheels and dual exhaust. This is the last year for the sixth-generation Grand Prix and this is the last year for the 6th generation mid-sized Grand Prix sedan.


==Seventh generation (1997–2003)==


In 1990, work began on a redesigned Grand Prix alongside other W-body cars under design chief John Manoogian II. By 1993, a final design was approved and show concept developed during the latter half of 1994. On January 4, 1995, General Motors unveiled the 300 GPX Concept at the 1995 Detroit Auto Show in Detroit. This was a near-exact preview of a redesign for the Grand Prix, due within the 1996 calendar year. In January 1996, the 1997 Grand Prix was unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show. Promoted for its &quot;wide track&quot; appearance and racy styling, this second-generation W-body Grand Prix sold well.

On the YouTube &quot;Rare Classic Cars &amp; Automotive History&quot; channel, Manoogian conducted a number of interviews about his and his team&#x27;s seminal idea for the seventh generation Grand Prix: &quot;a Learjet for the ground.&quot; They proposed a coupé, but also a sedan that would straddle aspects of a coupé, sacrificing the more &quot;upright, wear your hat utility&quot; of a traditional sedan — for the sleekness of a coupé. Responding to Pontiac&#x27;s marketing credo, &quot;We Build Excitement,&quot; Manoogian felt the idea would be well received and was able to convince his management, decades before numerous prominent examples of &quot;four-door coupés&quot; arrived on the market, namely the Volkswagen CC and Volkswagen Arteon and Mercedes CLA. 

===Stolen photos===
John Manoogian has related that during the Grand Prix&#x27;s design process, photographs of the initial clay model were stolen and sold (for $40,000, in 1990) to the Detroit Free Press, Autoweek, Car and Driver and Automobile magazine — the latter using the photos as the basis for the magazine&#x27;s July 1990 cover rendering. Time magazine carried the story when General Motors offered a $30,000 (in 1990) reward. The photo technician, a temporary contract employee for the GM Photographic Lab, attempted first to collect the reward by contacting GM&#x27;s security chief, calling back three days later, increasing the demand to $60,000 and then $75,000, saying a foreign car maker was interested. The extortion plot triggered FBI involvement, who were able to track and arrest the technician from phone records. GM was able to demonstrate that the publication of the photographs caused the company hundreds of millions in damages. The technician, Gregory Charles Hooper, faced five years in prison, and received a fourteen months jail sentence. The technician had tried to sell an original cache of 20 stolen photographs, including shots of the forthcoming Buick Skylark, Chevrolet Blazer, Saturn SC, Pontiac Bonneville, Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird — he had stolen more than 100 photographs. Authorities called it one of the &quot;nation&#x27;s costliest industrial espionage cases and the first federal criminal case of its kind to face the Big Three Automakers.&quot;

===Production and annual changes===

Production began on August 12, 1996. There were two trim levels available from 1996; the SE and GT. The base SE was only available as a sedan, while the sportier GT came in both coupe and sedan forms. The GTP trim package was available for GT models in either body style. Coupes and sedans shared similar styling, except for rear doors and quarter panels. The base 3.1 L v6 engine on the SE was the only engine carried over from the previous generation. The GT 3.4 L V6 was replaced by a Buick 3.8 L V6. This engine, in 3800 Series II form, was an option on the SE with 195 horsepower. The 3800 Series II was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1995–1997. Replacing the Chevy LQ1 3.4 L DOHC V6, an Eaton M90 supercharger option was available on the 3.8 L from 1997 to 2003 (also used in the 1996–2003 Bonneville), with compression ratio decreased from 9.3 to 8.5, boosted horsepower to 240. GTP interior trim level featured a &quot;performance shift&quot; button on the shifter that raised the transmission shift points. Front bucket seats came standard, while a 45/55 split-bench seat was available as an option on the SE sedan only.
1998: Few changes occurred this year, except that traction control now was available with the supercharged engine. Airbags were designed to deploy with reduced force. The tire-pressure monitor was dropped. Also on models equipped with 3.8L N/A powerplants (VIN K), the 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission was used in favor of the 4T60E previously used. To add some excitement, Pontiac also launched a special pace car model. This model celebrated the 40th running of the Daytona 500 on February 15, 1998. The pace-car replicas had special Medium Gulf Blue Metallic paint, unique &quot;Sparkle Silver&quot; 16-inch torque star aluminum wheels, custom decaling, a plaque notating the specific model number and custom door panels. Also standard was a head-up display that projected the speed onto the windshield. A total 1,500 were produced, of which 200 were equipped with sunroofs.

1999: Detail changes marked the 1999 editions of Pontiac&#x27;s midsize coupe and sedan. New wheel choices were the main visual change this year. The non-supercharged 3800 Series V6 engine gained 5 horsepower (now 200). This was also the last year that the SE model had the optional non-supercharged 3800 V6. GT models received a standard rear spoiler this year. GTP, previously a performance option for GT models, was now a stand-alone model in both coupe and sedan form. The coolant overflow reservoir was relocated from being in front of the intake box to being mounted to the passenger strut tower. Available alloy wheels came in a new 5-spoke design. The one new option was a Bose 8-speaker audio system.

2000: The standard 3.1 L V6, installed in SE models, gained 15 horsepower (now 175) it also gained 10lb⋅ft (now 195). New standard equipment included rear child-seat anchors and an anti-theft system that disabled the starter unless the proper ignition key was used. Pontiac also launched a Daytona 500 pace-car replica, with silver paint, unique aluminum wheels, functional hood vents, a NASCAR-inspired decklid spoiler, polished quad exhaust tips, and Daytona decals. Only 2,000 were planned.

2001:
OnStar, formerly unavailable on the Grand Prix, was made standard on GTP, optional on GT. The SE got revised frontal styling in the form of the GT and GTP front bumper cover in place of the older SE-specific front fascia, standard rear spoiler, and in-trunk emergency release; manual dual-zone climate-control replaced the optional electronic automatic unit previously offered. A Special Edition Package was added this year that could be applied to the GT and GTP models. This package adds the NASCAR-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, hood-mounted heat extractors, and polished dual-outlet exhaust tips previously offered on the 2000 Pace Car Replica and also adds a two-tone interior, 15-spoke chrome wheels, and the requisite badging. Also available for 2001 were two dealer-installed &quot;75th Anniversary&quot; emblems, to celebrate Pontiac&#x27;s 75th anniversary, they were placed in front of the badging on each door. A new, yet not very noticed feature for 2001 was added rear strut tower &quot;liners&quot;. This prevented common rust of the rear strut towers of the 1997-2000 models.

2002:
New for 2002 was a $2,695 40th Anniversary option package which included the NASCAR-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, polished dual-outlet exhaust tips, hood with heat extractors, and 15-spoke chrome wheels previously offered with the 2001 Special Edition package. Unique elements such as the Dark Cherry Metallic paint, 40th Anniversary badges, and Ruby Red and Graphite interior trim with the 40th Anniversary logo embroidered on the front seats and floormats differentiated this option package from the previous year&#x27;s offering.

One 40th Anniversary Sedan was further customized with a lowering package, different wheels, and exhaust for SEMA and featured in Hot Rod Magazine as the GP40. The lowering package, provided by GM Accessories, consisted of new front and rear adjustable springs, adjustable front and rear dampers and Z-rated tires mounted on forged aluminum wheels. GM Accessories also provided performance brake pads, drilled and slotted brake rotors (front and rear), a cat-back exhaust system, and a low-restriction air filter. The SE gained standard cruise control and dual-zone climate control, and GTs got a standard power driver&#x27;s seat and CD player. This was the last year of the two-door coupe. The SE model can be identified by a single exhaust pipe and different rear bumper cover. OnStar was now included standard on the GTP.

2003: Pontiac dropped the coupe version (2-door) for 2003 and made anti-lock brakes and traction control optional instead of standard on most of the remaining sedans. The Limited Edition option package was offered for GT and GTP models made this year. This optional package consisted of unique blue-tinted glass fog light lenses, &quot;Limited Edition&quot; badging, carbon fiber instrument cluster, two-tone cloth/leather interior, and a raised spoiler resembling the original GT/GTP/SE spoiler set atop three aerodynamic pillars. Production ceased in February 2003 and was the last GM car to have an analog odometer.

===Safety ratings===

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gives the 1997–2003 Grand Prix an &quot;Acceptable&quot; overall score for their frontal impact test.

===Recalls===
In March 2008, GM announced a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) due to a problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM sent a letter to the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.

In April 2009, the recall already posted for the Supercharged iterations of the 3800 Series II was expanded to cover all 3800 Series II engine-equipped vehicles after many fires were reported with Grand Prix GT and 3.8 L equipped SE versions, as well as the sister car Buick Regal LS. The recall for the non-supercharged V6 was to remove the front spark plug retainer and a valve cover gasket is not changed on non-supercharged 3.8 engines. The recall covered nearly 1.5 million vehicles.

In October 2015, GM announced a third recall for the 3800 V6 engines (RPO L26, L32, L36, and L67). This recall covers nearly 1.4 million vehicles including the 1997-2004 Pontiac Grand Prix. As of October 27, 2015, there is no remedy for this recall.

===OnStar Dysfunctionality===
As of May 2008, Grand Prixs from the model years of 01-03 that were outfitted with OnStar cannot be activated due to outdated technology. OnStar&#x27;s wireless services are provided by Verizon Wireless, which switched fully to digital cellular communications. Grand Prixs of model years 2001 to 2002 have OnStar systems that are Analog cellular capable only. Some 2003 models may have had modules that could be upgraded to digital-ready.

==Eighth generation (2004–2008)==

The Grand Prix was updated for 2004 using a revised version of the GM W platform and was unveiled at the 2002 Chicago Auto Show on February 7, 2002, as the Grand Prix G-Force Concept. The series production version was unveiled at the Los Angeles International Auto Show on January 3, 2003. The Grand Prix came in four different option groups; GT1, GT2, GTP, and GTP Comp-G (&quot;Competition Group&quot;).

The GT1 and GT2 use the Series III 3800 V6 engine, rated at 200 hp (150 kW) and 230 lb·ft (310 Nm) of torque, while both GTPs have the supercharged (Eaton Gen 5 Supercharger) 3800 Series III V6 engine with 260 hp (195 kW) and 280 lb·ft (380 Nm) of torque.

A Competition Group (Comp-G) package was available for the GTP that included red painted brake calipers (same brakes as the &#x27;standard&#x27; GTP), sport tuned suspension, head-up display (also in GT2 model), 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style TAPShift, StabiliTrak dynamic control system, 3.29 axle ratio, performance tires and Magnasteer II. Also, a 10-spoke lightweight wheel was standard with the Comp-G package but could be &#x27;upgraded&#x27; to the GTP optional wheel.

The newly redesigned model received mostly positive reviews from critics regarding its styling, performance, and reliability. Commencing with this generation, the 2-door coupe version of the Grand Prix was no longer available. This coincided with GM&#x27;s reintroduction of the 2-door Pontiac GTO. The Grand Prix was offered with an optional head-up display.

A 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT2 &quot;Special Edition&quot; was also offered in very limited supply, this model included special chrome spoke wheels, heated leather seats, the Monsoon sound system, and the head-up display. This Special Edition has the Pontiac SE name badging on the side of the car just behind the front wheels.

===2005===
The Grand Prix remained basically unchanged from 2004, with the GT, GTP, and the new GXP. The GT had the naturally aspirated 3.8 L V6, with the GTP having the 3.8 L V6 with supercharger. The Comp-G package was still available for the GTP with an added door emblem denoting the Comp-G package. When the GXP debuted later in the 2005 model year, the Competition Group was dropped, but several features were retained in a Sport package available on the GTP for the rest of that model year.

The GXP used the LS4 V8, a 5.3 L Displacement on Demand (active fuel management) engine based on the LS1 block. Output of this version is 303 hp (226 kW)/323 lb·ft (438 N·m). It used a shortened crankshaft, and a host of other modifications allowing it to fit the front-wheel-drive platform. The GXP also used a 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style TAPshift, head-up display, vented cross drilled brakes with PBR calipers, performance tuned suspension with Bilstein gas-charged struts (sits about lower than other GP models), Magnasteer II, and StabiliTrak dynamic control system. Also, the DIC displayed G-Force (maximum achieved for lateral, acceleration, and deceleration) information when the car is not moving. Cosmetically, the GXP differed from the other models with revised bodywork including a different front clip, wheel well cooling vents on the front fenders, a different rear bumper, and twin-dual polished exhaust. The Grand Prix GXP also offer different-width polished Alcoa forged aluminum wheels: the front wheels are wide, and the rear wheels are wide.

===2006===
For 2006, a Special Edition body package featured a body-colored SPO grille, new front and rear &quot;diffuser&quot; type bumpers, lower side skirts, and wheels. The three options were the Grand Prix, powered by the 3800 Series III V6, the GT, now powered by the 3800 Series III Supercharged V6, and the GXP, powered by the LS4 V8. The GTP designation was discontinued from the Grand Prix line and applied as the top trim of the G6. All General Motors 3.8 L Buick V6 powered cars become the first SULEV compliant vehicles. Chrome trim was added to the interiors of the GXP models.

===2007===
For the 2007 model year the lineup remained the Base, GT, and GXP models. Also, the Displacement on Demand displacement management system (on GXP 5.3 L V8s) was renamed Active Fuel Management, while the GXP trim included a V8 engine with a firmer suspension, performance tires, heated leather seats, a head-up display, and wheels. That model year marked the car&#x27;s final revision until the Grand Prix was pulled from Pontiac&#x27;s lineup after 2008, by adding GM badges near the front doors.

===2008===
2008 was the Pontiac Grand Prix&#x27;s last model year. For 2008, Pontiac did not offer the GT trim, but continued to offer both a base and GXP trim. The base trim was offered with wheels. The 2008 GXP used alcoa knockoff wheels with silver center caps. Several new colors were also added for the 2008 model year.

The Pontiac Grand Prix was replaced by the G8 for the 2008–2009 model year. Production of the larger G8, however, ended in June 2009. The Pontiac brand was dissolved in 2010 as part of GM&#x27;s Chapter 11 reorganization.

=== Safety ratings ===
The IIHS gives the Grand Prix a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the frontal impact test and a &quot;Marginal&quot; overall score for models equipped with side curtain airbags in the side impact test.

==Canadian variants==
During the first generation of the model line, the Pontiac Grand Prix was offered through GM of Canada under several brand names, styled slightly different from its U.S. namesake.

=== Parisienne Custom Sport (1964-1965) ===
In 1964, GM of Canada offered a de luxe version of the popular Pontiac Parisienne with the 1964 U.S. Grand Prix grille, the Parisienne Custom Sport. It was available as a hardtop coupe or convertible, and was basically equivalent to the Chevrolet Impala Super Sport.

=== Grande Parisienne (1966-1968) ===
For 1966, the Parisienne Custom Sport was replaced with the Pontiac Grande Parisienne, which featured the unique American Grand Prix front fascia (complete with hidden headlights in 1967–68). Unlike the U.S. car, the hardtop coupe was marketed alongside a convertible and four-door hardtop. The four-door and convertible versions had the same roofline as the standard Pontiacs while the coupe got the distinctive U.S. Grand Prix body styling.

Unlike the Grand Prix, the Grande Parisienne featured &quot;Pontiac&quot; badges in the grille. Following the shift of the Grand Prix from the full-size to the intermediate line for 1969, the Grande Parisienne was repackaged as a premium model of the full-size Parisienne. All full-sized Canadian Pontiacs used Chevrolet drivetrains with Pontiac-styled fascias and instrument panels.

<doc id="539882" wikidata="Q420574" url="?curid=539882" title="HLA-B27">
<text>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27 (subtypes B*2701-2759) is a class I surface molecule encoded by the B locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 and presents antigenic peptides (derived from self and non-self antigens) to T cells. HLA-B27 is strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other associated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and reactive arthritis.

==Prevalence==
The prevalence of HLA-B27 varies markedly in the global population.

In the United States, the estimated prevalence is 6-8%. 4% of North Africans, 2–9% of Chinese, and 0.1–0.5% of persons of Japanese descent possess the gene that codes for this antigen. Among the Sami in Northern Scandinavia (Sápmi), 24% of people are HLA-B27 positive, while 1.8% have associated ankylosing spondylitis, compared to 14-16% of Northern Scandinavians in general. In Finland, an estimated 14% of the population is positive for HLA-B27, while more than 95% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis and approximately 70–80% of patients with reactive arthritis have the genetic marker.

==Disease associations==

The vast majority of patients with positive HLA-B27 will not develop an associated syndrome.

The relationship between HLA-B27 and many diseases has not yet been fully elucidated. Though HLA-B27 is associated with a wide range of pathology, it does not appear to be the sole mediator in the development of disease. 

90% of people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are HLA-B27 positive, although only a small fraction of people with HLA-B27 will develop AS. People who are HLA-B27 positive are more likely to experience early onset AS than HLA-B27 negative individuals. Research is uncovering other genes that predispose to AS and associated diseases, and there are potential environmental factors that may play a role in susceptible individuals.

Approximately 40–50% of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have the HLA-B27 genotype.

HLA-B27 is implicated in other types of seronegative spondyloarthropathy, such as reactive arthritis, acute anterior uveitis, iritis, Crohn&#x27;s and ulcerative colitis associated spondyloarthritis. The shared association with HLA-B27 leads to increased clustering of these diseases. 

HLA antigens have been studied in relation to autism.

===Pathological mechanism===

HLA-B27 is the most researched HLA-B allele due to its high relationship with spondyloarthropathies. Although it is not apparent how HLA-B27 promotes disease, theories exist and can be divided between antigen-dependent and antigen-independent categories.

====Antigen-dependent theories====

These theories consider a specific combination of antigen peptide sequence and the binding groove (B pocket) of HLA-B27 (which will have different properties from the other HLA-B alleles). The &quot;arthritogenic peptide hypothesis&quot; suggests that HLA-B27 has a unique ability to bind antigens from a microorganism that triggers a CD8 T-cell response that cross-reacts with a HLA-B27/self-peptide pair. HLA-B27 can bind peptides at the cell surface. The &quot;molecular mimicry hypothesis&quot; is similar, although it suggests that cross-reactivity between some bacterial antigens and self-peptides can break tolerance and lead to autoimmunity.

====Antigen-independent theories====

Antigen-independent theories refer to the biochemical properties of HLA-B27. The &quot;misfolding hypothesis&quot; suggests that slow folding during HLA-B27&#x27;s tertiary structure folding and association with β2 microglobulin causes the protein to be misfolded, initiating the unfolded protein response (UPR), a pro-inflammatory endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Although this mechanism has been demonstrated &quot;in vitro&quot; and in animals, there is little evidence of its occurrence in human spondyloarthritis. The &quot;HLA-B27 heavy chain homodimer formation hypothesis&quot; suggests that B27 heavy chains tend to dimerise and accumulate in the ER, initiating the UPR. Cell surface B27 heavy chains and dimers can bind to regulatory immune receptors such as members of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor family, promoting the survival and differentiation of pro-inflammatory leukocytes in disease.

Another misfolding theory published in 2004 proposes that β2 microglobulin-free heavy chains of HLA-B27 undergo a facile conformational change in which the C-terminal end of domain two, consisting of a long helix, becomes subject to a helix-coil transition involving residues 169–181 of the heavy chain, owing to the conformational freedom newly experienced by domain three of the heavy chain when there is no longer any bound light chain, and owing to the consequent rotation around the backbone dihedral angles of residues 167/168. The proposed conformational transition is thought to allow the newly-generated coiled region (incorporating residues &#x27;RRYLENGKETLQR&#x27; which have also been found to be naturally bound to HLA-B27 as a 9-mer peptide) to bind to either the peptide-binding cleft of the same polypeptide chain (in an act of self-display) or to the cleft of another polypeptide chain (in an act of cross-display). Cross-display is proposed to lead to the formation of large, soluble, high molecular weight (HMW), degradation-resistant, long-surviving aggregates of the HLA-B27 heavy chain. Together with any homodimers formed either by cross-display or by a disulfide-linked homodimerization mechanism, it is proposed that such HMW aggregates survive on the cell surface without undergoing rapid degradation, and stimulate an immune response. Three previously noted features of HLA-B27, which distinguish it from other heavy chains, underlie the hypothesis: (1) HLA-B27 has been found to be bound to peptides longer than 9-mers, suggesting that the cleft can accommodate a longer polypeptide chain; (2) HLA-B27 has been found to itself contain a sequence that has also been actually discovered to be bound to HLA-B27, as an independent peptide; and (3) HLA-B27 heavy chains lacking β2 microglobulin have been seen on cell surfaces.

=== HIV long-term nonprogressors ===
About 1 in 500 people infected with HIV can remain symptom-free for many years without medication, a group known as long-term nonprogressors. The presence of HLA-B27, as well as HLA-B5701, is significantly common among this group.

<text>Hema Malini Dharmendra Deol (born 16 October 1948; ) is an Indian actress, director, producer, and politician who is currently serving as a member of the Lok Sabha from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), representing Mathura constituency since 2014. She was a member of the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka from 2011 to 2012, subsequent to her nomination to that chamber from 2003 to 2009 as a member of the BJP. Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has starred in both comic and dramatic roles, and is one of the most popular and successful leading actresses of mainstream Hindi cinema.

Malini made her acting debut in 1963 with the Tamil film &quot;Idhu Sathiyam&quot;. Malini first acted in a lead role in &quot;Sapno Ka Saudagar&quot; (1968), and went on to feature in numerous Hindi films, frequently opposite Dharmendra, whom she married in 1980. Malini was initially promoted as the &quot;Dream Girl&quot;, and in 1977 starred in a film of the same name. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her dual role in the comedy &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot; (1972), and was nominated ten more times leading up to &quot;Baghban&quot; (2003). In 2000, Malini won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and in 2019 a Filmfare Special Award for 50 Years of Outstanding Contribution to Cinema.

Malini was honoured with the Padma Shri in 2000, the fourth-highest civilian honour awarded by the Government of India. In 2012, the Sir Padampat Singhania University conferred an honorary doctorate on Malini in recognition of her contribution to Indian cinema. Malini served as chairperson of the National Film Development Corporation. In 2006, Malini received the Sopori Academy of Music And Performing Arts (SaMaPa) Vitasta award from Bhajan Sopori in Delhi for her contribution and service to Indian culture and dance. In 2013, she received the NTR National Award from the Government of Andhra Pradesh for her contribution to Indian cinema. Malini has been involved with charitable and social ventures. Currently, Malini is also a life member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

== Early life and family ==
Malini was born in a Tamil Iyengar Brahmin family to Jaya Lakshmi and VSR Chakravarti Iyengar in Ammankudi, Madras Province (now Tamil Nadu). She attended the Andhra Mahila Sabha in Chennai, where her favourite subject was history. She studied at DTEA Mandir Marg until the 11th Standard, after which she pursued her acting career.

Her first film with Dharmendra was &quot;Tum Haseen Main Jawaan&quot; (1970). They later married in 1980. Dharmendra already had two sons and two daughters with his first wife Prakash Kaur, two of whom later became Hindi cinema actors – Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol. Malini and Dharmendra have two children, Esha Deol (born 1981) and Ahana Deol Vohra (born 1985).

Madhoo, who played the female lead in &quot;Phool Aur Kaante&quot;, &quot;Roja&quot; and &quot;Annayya&quot;, is Malini&#x27;s niece.

On 11 June 2015, Malini became a grandmother when her younger daughter, Ahana Deol Vohra, gave birth to her first child, Darien Vohra and twin girls Astraia and Adea Vohra were born on 26 November 2020. On 19 October 2017, her elder daughter, Esha Deol, gave birth to a girl, Radhya Takhtani and another baby girl Miraya Takhtani on 10 June 2019. Businessman Vaibhav Vohra is her son-in-law and Bharat Takhtani is her ex-son-in-law.

==Film career==

=== 1960–1970 (Early work) ===
Malini had played small roles in &quot;Pandava Vanavasam&quot; (1965) and &quot;Idhu Sathiyam&quot; (1962). In 1968, she was chosen to play the lead opposite Raj Kapoor in &quot;Sapno Ka Saudagar&quot; and was promoted as the Dream Girl.

=== 1970–1979 (Established actress) ===
Malini played the lead in &quot;Johny Mera Naam&quot; (1970). Roles in subsequent films such as (1971) and &quot;Lal Patthar&quot; (1971) established her as a leading actress. In 1972, she played a double role opposite Dharmendra and Sanjeev Kumar in &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;, which earned her a Filmfare Best Actress Award for the film. The list of successful films she starred include &quot;Sanyasi&quot;, &quot;Dharmatma&quot; and &quot;Pratigya&quot;, &quot;Sholay&quot;, &quot;Trishul&quot; to name a few.

Malini and Dharmendra acted together in 28 films including &quot;Sharafat&quot;, &quot;Tum Haseen Main Jawan&quot;, &quot;Naya Zamana&quot;, &quot;Raja Jani&quot;, &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;, &quot;Patthar Aur Payal&quot;, &quot;Dost&quot; (1974), &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), &quot;Charas&quot;, &quot;Jugnu&quot;, &quot;Apna Khoon&quot;, &quot;Azaad&quot; (1978) and &quot;Dillagi&quot; (1978).

Her chemistry with Rajesh Khanna was appreciated in and &quot;Prem Nagar&quot;. Their subsequent films such as &quot;Mehbooba&quot; and &quot;Janta Hawaldar&quot; did not, however, do well at the box office.

===1980–1997 (Commercial success) ===
In the 80s Malini continued to star in big budget films such as &quot;Kranti&quot;, &quot;Naseeb&quot;, &quot;Satte Pe Satta&quot; and &quot;Rajput&quot;, most of which proved successful at the box office. She continued to work in heroine-centric roles after becoming a mother in films such as &quot;Aandhi Toofan&quot;, &quot;Durgaa&quot;, &quot;Ramkali&quot;, &quot;Sitapur Ki Geeta&quot;, &quot;Ek Chadar Maili Si&quot;, &quot;Rihaee&quot; and &quot;Jamai Raja&quot;.

During this period, her films with Dharmendra included &quot;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&quot;, &quot;Baghavat&quot;, &quot;Samraat&quot;, &quot;Razia Sultan&quot;, &quot;Baghavat&quot;, and &quot;Raaj Tilak&quot;. She continued to be paired with Rajesh Khanna in movies such as &quot;Dard&quot;, &quot;Bandish&quot;, &quot;Kudrat&quot;, &quot;Hum Dono&quot;, &quot;Rajput&quot;, &quot;Babu&quot;, &quot;Durgaa&quot;, &quot;Sitapur Ki Geeta&quot; and &quot;Paap Ka Ant&quot;, some of which were major successes in her career.

In the 1990s, she produced and directed the 1992 film &quot;Dil Aashna Hai&quot;, starring Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan in the leading roles. She also produced and directed her second feature film &quot;Mohini&quot; (1995), starring her niece Madhoo and actor Sudesh Berry in the leading roles. She then focused on dancing and television work, only occasionally appearing in films. In 1997, she acted in Vinod Khanna&#x27;s production &quot;Himalay Putra&quot;.

=== 2000(s)–present ===
After taking a break from films for a number of years, Malini made a comeback with &quot;Baghban&quot; (2003), for which she earned a Filmfare Best Actress Award nomination. She also made guest appearances in the 2004 film &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; and the 2007 film &quot;Laaga Chunari Mein Daag&quot;, in addition to a supporting role in the 2006 film &quot;Baabul&quot;. In 2010, she acted in &quot;Sadiyaan&quot; alongside fellow veteran actress Rekha. In 2011, she produced and directed her third feature film &quot;Tell Me O Kkhuda&quot; which featured both her husband Dharmendra and her daughter Esha Deol, which was a box office failure. In 2017 she acted in the film &quot;Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi&quot; in the role of Vijaya Raje Scindia of Gwalior, with Vinod Khanna as her husband; unfortunately it was Khanna&#x27;s last film. The film was directed by Gul Bahar Singh. The film was released on 21 April 2017. Her latest film is &quot;Shimla Mirchi&quot;, starring Rajkummar Rao and Rakul Preet Singh. The movie was theatrically released in India on 3 January 2020 and made available on Netflix on 27 January 2020.

In 2021, she was honoured with the Indian Film Personality of the Year Award at the 52nd International Film Festival of India.

==Political career==
In 1999, Malini campaigned for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, Vinod Khanna, a former Bollywood actor, in the Lok Sabha Elections in Gurdaspur, Punjab. In February 2004, Malini officially joined the BJP. From 2003 to 2009, she served as an MP to the upper housethe Rajya Sabha, having been nominated by the then President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. In March 2010, Malini was made general secretary of the BJP, and in February 2011, she was recommended by Ananth Kumar, the party general secretary. In the 2014 general elections for the Lok Sabha, Malini defeated the Mathura incumbent, Jayant Chaudhary (RLD) by 3,30,743 votes.

In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Hema Malini retained her Mathura Lok Sabha seat with comfortable margin. While Hema Malini won 6,71,293 votes, her nearest rival Kunwar Narendra Singh received 3,77,822 votes, so that she won the Mathura seat by around 3 lakh votes.

In 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Malini won Mathura Lok Sabha constituency by a huge margin against Congress candidate Mukesh Dhanger, making it a hat-trick from Mathura.

== Controversy ==
In 2016 the Bombay High Court entertained a Public Interest Litigation challenging allotment of a plot of land in Mumbai to Malini&#x27;s dance academy. The petitioner Ketan Tirodkar sought to file a cheating case against the actress for defrauding the government to allot a piece of land which was reserved for gardens. The State Government of Maharashtra informed the Bombay High Court that Malini had not yet accepted the land allotted to her.

She said, &quot;My friends at PETA have organised investigations at Jallikattu events and documented that bulls are pulled roughly by their nose rings, punched, pummelled, hit with sharp sticks and crammed into trucks so tightly that they can barely move&quot;. PETA named Malini their &quot;PETA Person of the Year&quot; for 2011. As a vegetarian, she said, &quot;Knowing that my food choices are helping the planet and animals too, makes me happy&quot;.

<doc id="539886" wikidata="Q5247397" url="?curid=539886" title="Shmuel HaNavi bus bombing">
<text>A Palestinian suicide bombing of a crowded public bus (Egged bus No. 2) in the Shmuel HaNavi quarter in Jerusalem took place on August 19, 2003. Twenty-four people were killed and over 130 wounded. Many of the victims were children, some of them infants. The Islamist militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack.

==Attack==
On August 19, 2003 (22 Av 5763), a Hamas suicide bomber sent out by the organization&#x27;s Hebron cell disguised himself as a Haredi Jew and detonated himself on a No. 2 Egged bus traveling through Jerusalem&#x27;s Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood. He blew himself up after entering the back door. The double-length bus was crowded with Orthodox Jewish children returning from a visit to the Western Wall. In addition to the perpetrator, the huge explosion killed 7 children and 16 adults, among them a woman who was eight months&#x27; pregnant, and injured more than 130 people. The bomb was spiked with ball-bearings designed to increase injuries on the crowded bus. Hamas said the bomber was a 29-year-old mosque preacher from the city of Hebron.

Because so many of the dead and injured were children, the media dubbed it the &quot;children&#x27;s bus&quot;. According to an Associated Press report,
==Perpetrators==
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Tariq Ali, however, the bombing was carried out by a &quot;self-proclaimed &#x27;Hamas&#x27; cell from Hebron, disowned and denounced by the official leadership.&quot; The attack put an end to the so-called Hudna that had been announced in July 2003. United States president George W. Bush sent his condolences to the victims&#x27; families. The European Commission also denounced what it called the &quot;devastating terrorist attack&quot; and called on the Palestinian Authority to intervene to bring a halt to such acts:

The European Commission strongly condemns last night&#x27;s devastating terrorist attack in Jerusalem and expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the Israeli Government. This is an attack on all the forces working for peace. The European Commission calls on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its powers to prevent such unacceptable and unjustified act of violence, and urges the PA and the Israeli Government to pursue their dialogue and common efforts towards peace as set out in the Road Map.

==Aftermath==
Following the attack, Israeli forces arrested 17 Palestinians suspected of being Hamas activists, including several of the bomber&#x27;s relatives, while Hamas leader Ismail Abu Shanab and his two bodyguards were killed by an Israeli helicopter missile strike in Gaza.

In 2004 a memorial plaque to the victims was erected in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem. The name of the only non-Jewish victim, Maria Antonia Reslas, was engraved separately from the names of the other victims, with the title &quot;Mrs&quot; rather than the title &quot;sainted&quot; (kadosh) used for the Jews, resulting in some controversy.

<text>Hugh Glass ( 1783 – 1833) was an American frontiersman, fur trapper, trader, hunter and explorer. He is best known for his story of survival and forgiveness after being left for dead by companions when he was mauled by a grizzly bear.

No records exist regarding his origins but he is widely said to have been born in Pennsylvania to Scotch-Irish parents. Glass became an explorer of the watershed of the Upper Missouri River, in present-day Montana, the Dakotas, and the Platte River area of Nebraska. His life story has been the basis of two feature-length films: &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015). They both portray the survival struggle of Glass, who crawled and stumbled to Fort Kiowa, South Dakota, after being abandoned without supplies or weapons by fellow explorers and fur traders during General Ashley&#x27;s expedition of 1823. Another version of the story was told in a 1966 episode of the TV series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, titled &quot;Hugh Glass Meets the Bear&quot;.

Despite the story&#x27;s popularity, its accuracy has been disputed. It was first recorded in 1825 in &quot;The Port Folio&quot;, a Philadelphia literary journal, as a literary piece and later picked up by various newspapers. Although originally published anonymously, it was later revealed to be the work of James Hall, brother of &quot;The Port Folio&quot;″s editor. There is no writing from Hugh Glass himself to corroborate the veracity of it. Also, it is likely to have been embellished over the years as a legend.

== Early life ==
Glass was born in Pennsylvania, to Irish parents who had emigrated from present day Northern Ireland. His life before the famous bear attack is largely unverifiable, and his frontier story contained numerous embellishments. He was reported to have been captured by pirates under the command of Gulf of Mexico chief Jean Lafitte off the coast of Texas in 1816, and was forced to become a pirate for up to two years. Glass allegedly escaped by swimming to shore near what is present-day Galveston, Texas. He was later rumored to have been captured by the Pawnee tribe, with whom he lived for several years. Glass traveled to St. Louis, Missouri in 1821, accompanying several Pawnee delegates invited to meet with U.S. authorities.

== General Ashley&#x27;s 1823 expedition ==
In 1822, many men responded to an advertisement in the &quot;Missouri Gazette and Public Advertiser&quot; placed by General William Henry Ashley, which called for a corps of 100 men to &quot;ascend the river Missouri&quot; as part of a fur-trading venture. Many of them, who later earned reputations as famous mountain men, joined the enterprise, including James Beckwourth, David Jackson, William Sublette, Jim Bridger, John S. Fitzgerald, James Clyman and Jedediah Smith. These men and others would later be known as &quot;Ashley&#x27;s Hundred&quot;. Glass, however, did not join Ashley&#x27;s company until the next year, when he ascended the Missouri River with Ashley. In June 1823, they met up with many of the men that had joined in 1822, and were attacked by Arikara warriors. Glass was apparently shot in the leg and the survivors retreated downstream and sent for help.

Glass wrote a letter to the parents of John S. Gardner, killed on June 2, 1823:

=== Grizzly bear mauling ===
Glass and the rest of the Ashley Party eventually returned to Fort Kiowa to regroup for the trip west. Andrew Henry, Ashley&#x27;s partner, had joined the group, and he along with Glass and several others set out overland to the Yellowstone River. Near the forks of the Grand River, near present-day Shadehill Reservoir, Perkins County, South Dakota, while scouting for game for the expedition larder, Glass surprised and disturbed a mother grizzly bear with two cubs. The bear charged, picked him up, bit, slashed and lacerated his flesh, severely wounded him, and forced him to the ground. Hearing Glass’ screams for help, several of the party made their way to Glass and killed the bear. In words attributed to another trapper, Hiram Allen, who was at the scene: &quot;the monster had torn the flesh from the lower part of the body, and from the lower limbs. He also had his neck shockingly torn, even to the degree that an aperture appeared to have been made into the windpipe, and his breath to exude at the side of is neck. Blood flowed freely, but fortunately his hands and arms were not disabled.&quot; The men were convinced Glass would not survive his injuries; nevertheless, they carried Glass on a litter for two days, but doing so greatly slowed the pace of the group&#x27;s travel.

Henry asked for two volunteers to stay with Glass until he died and then bury him. John S. Fitzgerald and a man later identified as &quot;Bridges&quot; stepped forward, and as the rest of the party moved on, began digging his grave. Later, claiming that they were interrupted by attacking Arikara, the pair grabbed the rifle, knife, and other equipment belonging to Glass and took flight. Fitzgerald and &quot;Bridges&quot; later caught up with the party and incorrectly reported to Ashley that Glass had died. There is a debate whether Bridges was actually famed mountain man Jim Bridger.

Despite his injuries, Glass regained consciousness, but found himself abandoned without weapons or equipment. He had festering wounds, a broken leg, and deep cuts on his back that exposed his bare ribs. Glass lay mutilated and alone, more than from the nearest American settlement at Fort Kiowa, on the Missouri River. Glass set the bone of his own leg, wrapped himself in the bear hide his companions had placed over him as a shroud, and began crawling back to Fort Kiowa. To prevent gangrene, Glass allowed maggots to eat the dead infected flesh in his wounds.

Using Thunder Butte as a navigational landmark, Glass crawled overland south toward the Cheyenne River where he fashioned a crude raft and floated downstream to Fort Kiowa. The journey took him six weeks. He survived mostly on wild berries and roots.

== Pursuit of Fitzgerald and &quot;Bridges&quot; ==
After recovering from his wounds, Glass set out again to find John Fitzgerald and &quot;Bridges&quot;. He eventually travelled to Fort Henry on the Yellowstone River but found it deserted. A note indicated that Andrew Henry and company had relocated to a new camp at the mouth of the Bighorn River. Arriving there, Glass found &quot;Bridges&quot;, but apparently forgave him because of his youth, and then re-enlisted with Ashley&#x27;s company.

Glass later learned that Fitzgerald had joined the army and was stationed at Fort Atkinson in present-day Nebraska. Glass reportedly spared Fitzgerald&#x27;s life because he would be killed by the army captain for killing a soldier of the United States Army. However, the captain asked Fitzgerald to return the stolen rifle to Glass, and before departing Glass warned Fitzgerald never to leave the army, or he would still kill him. According to an account by Glass&#x27;s friend George C. Yount, not published until 1923, Glass also obtained $300 as compensation.

== Further explorations for General Ashley in 1824 ==
In the period intervening, between finding &quot;Bridges&quot; and finding Fitzgerald, Glass and four others were dispatched in February 1824 with mail for Fort Atkinson. They traveled up the Powder River, then across to the Platte River. There they constructed bull skin boats and traveled down the Platte River to the lower end of the Black Hills. Glass and his party discovered a settlement of 38 lodges of Arikara. Their leader, who was known by Glass, declared the tribe to be friendly and invited them in so the men went ashore. While smoking with him in his lodge, Glass noticed their equipment being taken by the residents and realized it was a trap. The men quickly fled but two were killed by the pursuing war party. Glass managed to hide behind some rocks until the Arikara gave up their search but was separated from the two other survivors. He was relieved to find his knife and flint in his shot pouch and traveled to Fort Kiowa, surviving off the land.

Glass returned to the frontier as a trapper and fur trader. He was later employed as a hunter for the U.S. Army garrison at Fort Union, near Williston, North Dakota.

==Death==
Glass was killed along with two of his fellow trappers (Edward Rose and Hilain Menard) in early 1833 on the Yellowstone River in an attack by the Arikara.

A monument to Glass was placed near the site of his mauling on the southern shore of the present-day Shadehill Reservoir in Perkins County, South Dakota, at the forks of the Grand River. The nearby Hugh Glass Lakeside Use Area is a free state-managed campground and picnic area.

<text>An exoenzyme, or extracellular enzyme, is an enzyme that is secreted by a cell and functions outside that cell. Exoenzymes are produced by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and have been shown to be a crucial component of many biological processes. Most often these enzymes are involved in the breakdown of larger macromolecules. The breakdown of these larger macromolecules is critical for allowing their constituents to pass through the cell membrane and enter into the cell. For humans and other complex organisms, this process is best characterized by the digestive system which breaks down solid food via exoenzymes. The small molecules, generated by the exoenzyme activity, enter into cells and are utilized for various cellular functions. Bacteria and fungi also produce exoenzymes to digest nutrients in their environment, and these organisms can be used to conduct laboratory assays to identify the presence and function of such exoenzymes. Some pathogenic species also use exoenzymes as virulence factors to assist in the spread of these disease-causing microorganisms. In addition to the integral roles in biological systems, different classes of microbial exoenzymes have been used by humans since pre-historic times for such diverse purposes as food production, biofuels, textile production and in the paper industry. Another important role that microbial exoenzymes serve is in the natural ecology and bioremediation of terrestrial and marine environments.

==History==
Very limited information is available about the original discovery of exoenzymes. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term &quot;exoenzyme&quot; was first recognized in the English language in 1908. The book &quot;Intracellular Enzymes: A Course of Lectures Given in the Physiological,&quot; by Horace Vernon is thought to be the first publication using this word in that year. Based on the book, it can be assumed that the first known exoenzymes were pepsin and trypsin, as both are mentioned by Vernon to have been discovered by scientists Briike and Kiihne before 1908.

==Function==
In bacteria and fungi, exoenzymes play an integral role in allowing the organisms to effectively interact with their environment. Many bacteria use digestive enzymes to break down nutrients in their surroundings. Once digested, these nutrients enter the bacterium, where they are used to power cellular pathways with help from endoenzymes.

Many exoenzymes are also used as virulence factors. Pathogens, both bacterial and fungal, can use exoenzymes as a primary mechanism with which to cause disease. The metabolic activity of the exoenzymes allows the bacterium to invade host organisms by breaking down the host cells&#x27; defensive outer layers or by necrotizing body tissues of larger organisms. Many gram-negative bacteria have injectisomes, or flagella-like projections, to directly deliver the virulent exoenzyme into the host cell using a type three secretion system. With either process, pathogens can attack the host cell&#x27;s structure and function, as well as its nucleic DNA.

In eukaryotic cells, exoenzymes are manufactured like any other enzyme via protein synthesis, and are transported via the secretory pathway. After moving through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, they are processed through the Golgi apparatus, where they are packaged in vesicles and released out of the cell. In humans, a majority of such exoenzymes can be found in the digestive system and are used for metabolic breakdown of macronutrients via hydrolysis. Breakdown of these nutrients allows for their incorporation into other metabolic pathways.

==Examples of exoenzymes as virulence factors==

Source:

===Necrotizing enzymes===
Necrotizing enzymes destroy cells and tissue. One of the best known examples is an exoenzyme produced by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; that causes necrotizing fasciitis in humans.

===Coagulase===
By binding to prothrombin, coagulase facilitates clotting in a cell by ultimately converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Bacteria such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; use the enzyme to form a layer of fibrin around their cell to protect against host defense mechanisms.

===Kinases===
The opposite of coagulase, kinases can dissolve clots. &quot;S. aureus&quot; can also produce staphylokinase, allowing them to dissolve the clots they form, to rapidly diffuse into the host at the correct time.

===Hyaluronidase===
Similar to collagenase, hyaluronidase enables a pathogen to penetrate deep into tissues. Bacteria such as &quot;Clostridium&quot; do so by using the enzyme to dissolve collagen and hyaluronic acid, the protein and saccharides, respectively, that hold tissues together.

===Hemolysins===
Hemolysins target erythrocytes, a.k.a. red blood cells. Attacking and lysing these cells harms the host organism, and provides the microorganism, such as the fungus &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, with a source of iron from the lysed hemoglobin. Organisms can either by alpha-hemolytic, beta-hemolytic, or gamma-hemolytic (non-hemolytic).
==Examples of digestive exoenzymes==
===Amylases===

Amylases are a group of extracellular enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of starch into maltose. These enzymes are grouped into three classes based on their amino acid sequences, mechanism of reaction, method of catalysis and their structure. The different classes of amylases are α-amylases, β-amylases, and glucoamylases. The α-amylases hydrolyze starch by randomly cleaving the 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages between glucose units, β-amylases cleave non-reducing chain ends of components of starch such as amylose, and glucoamylases hydrolyze glucose molecules from the ends of amylose and amylopectin. Amylases are critically important extracellular enzymes and are found in plants, animals, and microorganisms. In humans, amylases are secreted by the pancreas and salivary glands, with both sources of the enzyme required for complete starch hydrolysis.

===Lipoprotein lipase===
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a type of digestive enzyme that helps regulate the uptake of triacylglycerols from chylomicrons and other low-density lipoproteins from fatty tissues in the body. The exoenzymatic function allows it to break down the triacylglycerol into two free fatty acids and one molecule of monoacylglycerol. LPL can be found in endothelial cells in fatty tissues, such as adipose, cardiac, and muscle. Lipoprotein lipase is downregulated by high levels of insulin, and upregulated by high levels of glucagon and adrenaline.

===Pectinase===
Pectinases, also called pectolytic enzymes, are a class of exoenzymes that are involved in the breakdown of pectic substances, most notably pectin. Pectinases can be classified into two different groups based on their action against the galacturonan backbone of pectin: de-esterifying and depolymerizing. These exoenzymes can be found in both plants and microbial organisms including fungi and bacteria. Pectinases are most often used to break down the pectic elements found in plants and plant-derived products.

===Pepsin===
Discovered in 1836, pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be classified as an exoenzyme. The enzyme is first made in the inactive form, pepsinogen by chief cells in the lining of the stomach. With an impulse from the vagus nerve, pepsinogen is secreted into the stomach, where it mixes with hydrochloric acid to form pepsin. Once active, pepsin works to break down proteins in foods such as dairy, meat, and eggs. Pepsin works best at the pH of gastric acid, 1.5 to 2.5, and is deactivated when the acid is neutralized to a pH of 7.

===Trypsin===
Also one of the first exoenzymes to be discovered, trypsin was named in 1876, forty years after pepsin. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of large globular proteins and its activity is specific to cleaving the C-terminal sides of arginine and lysine amino acid residues. It is the derivative of trypsinogen, an inactive precursor that is produced in the pancreas. When secreted into the small intestine, it mixes with enterokinase to form active trypsin. Due to its role in the small intestine, trypsin works at an optimal pH of 8.0.
==Bacterial assays==

The production of a particular digestive exoenzyme by a bacterial cell can be assessed using plate assays. Bacteria are streaked across the agar, and are left to incubate. The release of the enzyme into the surroundings of the cell cause the breakdown of the macromolecule on the plate. If a reaction does not occur, this means that the bacteria does not create an exoenzyme capable of interacting with the surroundings. If a reaction does occur, it becomes clear that the bacteria does possess an exoenzyme, and which macromolecule is hydrolyzed determines its identity.

===Amylase===
Amylase breaks down carbohydrates into mono- and disaccharides, so a starch agar must be used for this assay. Once the bacteria is streaked on the agar, the plate is flooded with iodine. Since iodine binds to starch but not its digested by-products, a clear area will appear where the amylase reaction has occurred. &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; is a bacterium that results in a positive assay as shown in the picture.

===Lipase===
Lipase assays are done using a lipid agar with a spirit blue dye. If the bacteria has lipase, a clear streak will form in the agar, and the dye will fill the gap, creating a dark blue halo around the cleared area. &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; results in a positive lipase assay.
==Biotechnological and industrial applications==
Microbiological sources of exoenzymes including amylases, proteases, pectinases, lipases, xylanases, and cellulases are used for a wide range of biotechnological and industrial uses including biofuel generation, food production, paper manufacturing, detergents and textile production. Optimizing the production of biofuels has been a focus of researchers in recent years and is centered around the use of microorganisms to convert biomass into ethanol. The enzymes that are of particular interest in ethanol production are cellobiohydrolase which solubilizes crystalline cellulose and xylanase that hydrolyzes xylan into xylose. One model of biofuel production is the use of a mixed population of bacterial strains or a consortium that work to facilitate the breakdown of cellulose materials into ethanol by secreting exoenzymes such as cellulases and laccases. In addition to the important role it plays in biofuel production, xylanase is utilized in a number of other industrial and biotechnology applications due to its ability to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. These applications include the breakdown of agricultural and forestry wastes, working as a feed additive to facilitate greater nutrient uptake by livestock, and as an ingredient in bread making to improve the rise and texture of the bread.
Lipases are one of the most used exoenzymes in biotechnology and industrial applications. Lipases make ideal enzymes for these applications because they are highly selective in their activity, they are readily produced and secreted by bacteria and fungi, their crystal structure is well characterized, they do not require cofactors for their enzymatic activity, and they do not catalyze side reactions. The range of uses of lipases encompasses production of biopolymers, generation of cosmetics, use as a herbicide, and as an effective solvent. However, perhaps the most well known use of lipases in this field is its use in the production of biodiesel fuel. In this role, lipases are used to convert vegetable oil to methyl- and other short-chain alcohol esters by a single transesterification reaction.
Cellulases, hemicellulases and pectinases are different exoenzymes that are involved in a wide variety of biotechnological and industrial applications. In the food industry these exoenzymes are used in the production of fruit juices, fruit nectars, fruit purees and in the extraction of olive oil among many others. The role these enzymes play in these food applications is to partially breakdown the plant cell walls and pectin. In addition to the role they play in food production, cellulases are used in the textile industry to remove excess dye from denim, soften cotton fabrics, and restore the color brightness of cotton fabrics. Cellulases and hemicellulases (including xylanases) are also used in the paper and pulp industry to de-ink recycled fibers, modify coarse mechanical pulp, and for the partial or complete hydrolysis of pulp fibers. Cellulases and hemicellulases are used in these industrial applications due to their ability to hydrolyze the cellulose and hemicellulose components found in these materials.

==Bioremediation applications==

Bioremediation is a process in which pollutants or contaminants in the environment are removed through the use of biological organisms or their products. The removal of these often hazardous pollutants is mostly carried out by naturally occurring or purposely introduced microorganisms that are capable of breaking down or absorbing the desired pollutant. The types of pollutants that are often the targets of bioremediation strategies are petroleum products (including oil and solvents) and pesticides. In addition to the microorganisms ability to digest and absorb the pollutants, their secreted exoenzymes play an important role in many bioremediation strategies.

Fungi have been shown to be viable organisms to conduct bioremediation and have been used to aid in the decontamination of a number of pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, synthetic dyes, chlorophenols, explosives, crude oil, and many others. While fungi can breakdown many of these contaminants intracellularly, they also secrete numerous oxidative exoenzymes that work extracellularly. One critical aspect of fungi in regards to bioremediation is that they secrete these oxidative exoenzymes from their ever elongating hyphal tips. Laccases are an important oxidative enzyme that fungi secrete and use oxygen to oxidize many pollutants. Some of the pollutants that laccases have been used to treat include dye-containing effluents from the textile industry, wastewater pollutants (chlorophenols, PAHs, etc.), and sulfur-containing compounds from coal processing.

Bacteria are also a viable source of exoenzymes capable of facilitating the bioremediation of the environment. There are many examples of the use of bacteria for this purpose and their exoenzymes encompass many different classes of bacterial enzymes. Of particular interest in this field are bacterial hydrolases as they have an intrinsic low substrate specificity and can be used for numerous pollutants including solid wastes. Plastic wastes including polyurethanes are particularly hard to degrade, but an exoenzyme has been identified in a Gram-negative bacterium, &quot;Comamonas acidovorans&quot;, that was capable of degrading polyurethane waste in the environment. Cell-free use of microbial exoenzymes as agents of bioremediation is also possible although their activity is often not as robust and introducing the enzymes into certain environments such as soil has been challenging. In addition to terrestrial based microorganisms, marine based bacteria and their exoenzymes show potential as candidates in the field of bioremediation. Marine based bacteria have been utilized in the removal of heavy metals, petroleum/diesel degradation and in the removal of polyaromatic hydrocarbons among others.

<doc id="539893" wikidata="Q1244718" url="?curid=539893" title="Helenius Acron">
<text>Helenius Acron (or Acro) was a Roman commentator and grammarian, probably of the 3rd century AD, but whose precise date is not known.

Helenius Acron is known to have written on Terence (&quot;Adelphi&quot; and &quot;Eunuchus&quot; at least) and Horace. These commentaries on Horace are now lost but are referred to by the grammarian Charisius. There is some evidence for a commentary on Persius.

&quot;Scholia&quot; attributed to Acron appear in manuscripts of Horace; there are three recensions known, the earliest dating to the 5th century. The fragments which remain of the work on Horace, though much mutilated, are valuable, as containing the remarks of the older commentators, Quintus Terentius Scaurus and others. The attribution to Acron, however, is not found before the 15th century, and is doubtful. The scholiast may therefore be called Pseudo-Acron.

Fragments of Acron&#x27;s writing may also appear in Pomponius Porphyrion.

<text>Andrew Michael &quot;Andy&quot; Allen (born 4 August 1955) is a retired American astronaut. A former Marine aviator and lieutenant colonel, he worked as a test pilot before joining NASA in 1987. He flew three Space Shuttle missions before retiring in 1997.

Since 2006, Allen was CEO and owner of Aerodyne Industries in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

==Early life and education==
Andrew Michael Allen was born on 4 August 1955 in Richboro, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Archbishop Wood Catholic High School in 1973, following an education at Richboro Junior High (currently Richboro Middle School). In 2003, he was interviewed for the school&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Viking Voice&quot; about Allen&#x27;s history with NASA and the future of the agency in regard to the then-recent Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. He subsequently studied at Villanova University where he received a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 1977. At Villanova, he was initiated into the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. In 2004, Allen also received an MBA degree from the University of Florida.

==Career==
===Military===
Allen received his commission in the United States Marine Corps at Villanova University in 1977. Following graduation from flight school, he flew F-4 Phantoms from 1980 to 1983 with squadron VMFA-312 at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, and was assigned as Aircraft Maintenance Officer. He was selected by Headquarters Marine Corps for fleet introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, and was assigned to VMFA-531 in Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, from 1983 to 1986. During his stay in VMFA-531, he was assigned as the squadron operations officer, and also attended and graduated from the Marine Weapons &amp; Tactics Instructor Course, and the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (Top Gun). A 1987 graduate of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, he was a test pilot under instruction when advised of his selection to the astronaut program. He logged over 6,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.

===NASA experience===
Selected by NASA in June 1987, Allen became an astronaut in August 1988. His technical assignments have included: Astronaut Office representative for all Space Shuttle issues related to landing sites, landing and deceleration hardware, including improvements to nosewheel steering, brakes and tires, and drag chute design; Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), which oversees, checks, and verifies all Shuttle flight control software and avionics programs; Technical Assistant to the Flight Crew Operations Director who is responsible for and manages all flight crew operations and support; lead of the Astronaut Support Personnel team which oversee Shuttle test, checkout, and preparation at the Kennedy Space Center; Special Assistant to the Director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas; lead of a Functional Workforce Review at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to determine minimal workforce and management structure requirements which allow maximum budget reductions while safely continuing Shuttle Flight Operations; Director of Space Station Requirements at NASA Headquarters, responsible for the International Space Station requirements, policies, external communications and liaison with Congress, international partners, and industry. A veteran of three space flights, Allen has logged over 900 hours in space. He was the pilot on STS-46 in 1992 and STS-62 in 1994, and was mission commander on STS-75 in 1996.

===Spaceflight experience===

====STS-46====
STS-46 was an 8-day mission aboard the which featured the deployment of the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), an ESA-sponsored free-flying science platform, and demonstrated the Tethered Satellite System (TSS), a joint project between NASA and the Italian Space Agency. STS-46 launched July 31, 1992, and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1992. The flight completed 126 orbits covering 3.3 million miles in 191.3 hours.

====STS-62====
STS-62 was a 14-day mission aboard the which consisted of 5 crewmembers that conducted a broad range of science and technology experiments with Earth applications to materials processing, biotechnology, advanced technology, and environmental monitoring. Principal payloads of the mission were the United States Microgravity Payload 2 (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology 2 (OAST-2) package. STS-62 launched March 4, 1994, and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 18, 1994. The flight completed 224 orbits covering 5.8 million miles in 335.3 hours.

====STS-75====
STS-75 was a 16-day mission aboard the with principal payloads being the reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and the third flight of the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3). The TSS successfully demonstrated the ability of tethers to produce electricity. The TSS experiment produced a wealth of new information on the electrodynamics of tethers and plasma physics before the tether broke at 19.7 km, just shy of the 20.7 km goal. The crew also worked around the clock performing combustion experiments and research related to USMP-3 microgravity investigations used to improve production of medicines, metal alloys, and semiconductors. STS-75 launched on February 22 and landed on March 9, 1996. The mission was completed in 252 orbits covering 6.5 million miles in 377 hours and 40 minutes.

===Aerodyne Industries===
Allen retired from the Marine Corps and left NASA in October 1997, and is now CEO of Aerodyne Industries in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company was founded in 1968 by his father Dr. Charles Allen.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2017, Allen was recognized by the National Space Club&#x27;s Florida Committee with the Dr. Kurt Debus Award. 

In 2022, he was named &quot;Entrepreneur of The Year 2022 Florida Award&quot; by Ernst &amp; Young.

In the spring of 2023, Allen was featured in &quot;Space Coast Living&quot; magazine, while Embraer included an interview with him in their trade journal, &quot;Advantage&quot;. and an accompanying video on YouTube.

<doc id="539899" wikidata="Q876107" url="?curid=539899" title="Duchy of Cornwall">
<text>The Duchy of Cornwall () is one of two royal duchies in England, the other being the Duchy of Lancaster. The eldest son of the reigning British monarch obtains possession of the duchy and the title of Duke of Cornwall at birth or when his parent succeeds to the throne, but may not sell assets for personal benefit and has limited rights and income while a minor.

The current duke is William, Prince of Wales. When the monarch has no male children, the rights and responsibilities of the duchy revert to the Crown.

The Duchy Council, called the Prince&#x27;s Council, meets twice a year and is chaired by the duke. The Prince&#x27;s Council is a non-executive body which provides advice to the duke with regard to the management of the duchy. The duchy also exercises certain legal rights and privileges across Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, including some that elsewhere in England belong to the Crown. The duke appoints a number of officials in the county and acts as the port authority for the main harbour of the Isles of Scilly.

The government considers the duchy to be a crown body and therefore exempt from paying corporation tax. The tax exempt status of the duchy has been challenged. From 1993 to his accession to the throne in 2022, Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, paid income tax voluntarily on the surplus of the Duchy of Cornwall, after official expenditure had been deducted at the highest rate. The practice is continued by his elder son and the current duke, Prince William.

==Financial arrangements==
The principal activity of the duchy is the management of its land holdings in England of . This includes of land in Cornwall itself which comprises 13% of the whole Duchy estate. Half of the estate is on Dartmoor in Devon, with other large holdings in Herefordshire, Somerset and almost all of the Isles of Scilly. The duchy also has a portfolio of financial investments.

The administration of the duchy is regulated by the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall (Accounts) Act 1838, which requires the Treasury&#x27;s supervision and for the accounts to be presented to both Houses of Parliament.

The duchy has special legal rights, such as the rules on &quot;bona vacantia&quot;. This right to ownerless property operates in favour of the duchy rather than the Crown, such that the property of anyone who dies in the county of Cornwall without a will or identifiable heirs, and assets belonging to dissolved companies whose registered office was in Cornwall, pass to the duchy. In 2007, £130,000 was realised from the right of &quot;bona vacantia&quot;, and given to a charitable fund.

The duchy was created with the express purpose of providing income to the heir apparent to the throne; however, the terms of the original creation limit the title Duke of Cornwall to the eldest son of the monarch if, and only if, that son is also the heir-apparent; since 2015, the eldest child (regardless of sex) of the monarch would usually be the heir-apparent, but no change has been made to allow an eldest daughter to take the title Duchess of Cornwall. The Duke of Cornwall has the &#x27;interest in possession&#x27; of the duchy&#x27;s assets (such as estates) which means they enjoy its net income, do not have its outright ownership and do not have the right to sell capital assets for their own benefit.

In 1913 the government law officers gave an opinion that the Duke of Cornwall is not liable to taxation on income from the Duchy. However, from 1993 to his accession to the throne in 2022, Prince Charles voluntarily agreed to pay income tax at the normal rates (see Finances of the British Royal Family).

Since the coming into force of the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall will pass to the heir to the throne, regardless of whether that heir is the Duke of Cornwall. In the event that the heir is a minor, 10% of the revenues will pass to the heir, with the balance passing to the Crown.

The duchy generated an income of £21.7m in 2017–18. This paid for most of the official and charitable activities of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the official offices of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The duchy paid William, Duke of Cornwall £23.6m in his first full year after inheriting the land and property owning estate from his father. The income is used to fund the charitable and private activities of William, his wife and their three children.

==History==
The duchy was established on 17 March 1337 by the Royal Great Charter out of the former Earldom of Cornwall by Edward III for his son, Edward, Prince of Wales, the &quot;Black Prince&quot;, who became the first Duke of Cornwall.

The charter established that the Duke of Cornwall is to be the eldest surviving son of the monarch and the heir to the throne. Additional charters were issued later by Edward III. The duchy consisted of the title and honour, and the land holdings that supported it financially. The charter afforded the duke certain rights and responsibilities in the county, including the right to appoint the county&#x27;s sheriff and to the profits from the county courts, the stannaries and the ports. The duchy estate, which was based on the holdings of the previous earls, did not comprise the whole of the county, and much of it lay outside Cornwall. The extent of the estate has varied as various holdings have been sold and others acquired over the years, both within Cornwall and in other counties.

Under the charter, the manors of the earldom passed to the duchy. The original 17 manors, all in Cornwall, are known as the &quot;antiqua maneria&quot;. Those outside Cornwall given to the duchy at its creation are known as the &quot;forinseca maneria&quot; (foreign manors), with estates incorporated later becoming known as the &quot;annexata maneria&quot;.

The first duke ordered a survey called &quot;The Caption of Seisin of the Duchy of Cornwall&quot; in May 1337 to determine the extent of duchy holdings of Cornish land including manors, castles and knights&#x27; fees, profits from the stannary courts and shrievalty of Cornwall, and other revenues.

A subsequent charter of Henry IV to Prince Henry stated:
We have made and created Henry our most dear first-begotten Son, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester, and have given and granted, and by our Charter have confirmed to him the said Principality, Duchy, and Earldom, that he may preside there, and by presiding, may direct and defend the said parts. We have invested him with the said Principality, Duchy, and Earldom, &quot;per sertum in capite et annulum in digito aureum ac virgam auream juxta morem&quot;.

With the death of Prince Arthur in 1502, the Prince&#x27;s Council became defunct. From 1547 to 1603, there was no male royal heir to hold the title of duke, and the duchy reverted to the Crown, in effect becoming a department of the Exchequer. The council was revived in 1611 to deal with a food crisis.

===The duchy in the Interregnum, 1649–1660===
On the death of King Charles I, the Crown lands came under the control of Parliament; this lasted until the restoration of King Charles II in 1660.

===Post-Interregnum===



In 1830, the Whigs argued that revenues from the two duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster should go to the public, but to secure King William IV&#x27;s support for the Reform Act 1832 they eventually approved the civil list and left the duchies in possession of the royal family. In the 1880s the Duchy was 74,000 acres.

Parliament debated the two duchies&#x27; ownership multiple times, including when Queen Victoria and King Edward VII ascended the throne, respectively. In 1936, leader of the opposition Clement Attlee introduced an amendment to the civil list bill which would have seen the duchies surrendered in exchange for an adjusted annual sum of money tied to the actual cost of royal functions, but the amendment was defeated. In 1971, a private member&#x27;s bill to nationalise the duchy was defeated, but more than 100 MPs supported it.

Upon Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s ascension to the throne, the then Prince Charles began receiving £209,000 from the duchy, with duchy authorities stating that it was spent towards his &quot;maintenance and education&quot;. In 1969, the government acknowledged that his duchy income was &quot;considerably in excess of his current expenses&quot;.

In 1975, Prince Charles established the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Benevolent Fund to benefit south west communities, with revenue coming from the net proceeds from Cornwall &quot;bona vacantia&quot;. In August 1980 the Highgrove estate was purchased by the Duchy of Cornwall for a figure believed to be between £800,000 and £1,000,000 with funds raised for its purchase by the sale of three properties from the duchy&#x27;s holdings, including part of the village of Daglingworth in Gloucestershire.

In 1988, West Dorset District Council allocated land in the ducal estate, west of Dorchester, for housing development, which became known as Poundbury. The Duchy Originals company was set up in 1992 to use produce from farms on the ducal estate, with some proceeds going to his charities. Duchy Originals was licensed out to Waitrose in 2009 after losses in 2008. In 2006, Llwynywermod was purchased by the Duchy as a residence for the Duke in Wales.

In 1995, the duchy granted a 99-year lease of the uninhabited islets of the Isles of Scilly, plus the untenanted land on the five inhabited islands, to the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust for an annual payment of a single daffodil. On 7 February 2005, the Duchy of Cornwall&#x27;s finances came under public scrutiny by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee.

Under the Land Registration Act 2002, the Duchy was required by October 2013 to have filed with the Land Registry mineral rights given to the Duchy in 1337. Some land owners of Talskiddy were surprised that these rights would be expressly inserted into their registers of title upon being informed of the filing in February 2012.

In January 2012, the Duchy purchased a warehouse at Milton Keynes from Waitrose. The Duchy was involved in the Truro Eastern District Centre (TEDC) project. The TEDC project would see a park and ride, a recycling centre, 110 homes and a Waitrose at the junction of Union Hill and Newquay Road. The project received Cornwall Council approval in March 2012, but the Truro Council challenged it in court. This brought questions over the relationship between the Duchy and Waitrose.

In 2013 permission was given for the building of Nansledan, an urban extension to Newquay in Cornwall, which the Duchy had been planning since the early 2000s. Construction began a few months later.

In 2013, the Duchy&#x27;s office in Cornwall moved from Liskeard to Restormel Manor&#x27;s old farm buildings. In 2014, the Duchy purchased the southern half of the Port Eliot estate from Lord St Germans. By 2015, William, Prince of Wales had started attending the twice-yearly Duchy Council. In 2017, the Paradise Papers revealed that the Duchy held investments in offshore funds and companies. The palace later stated that offshore investments had been exited by 2019.

==Property==

The duchy owns – 0.2% of UK land – in over 23 counties, including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio.

By the 17th century, the ducal estates were classified as being a part of one of three groups:

#&quot;Antiqua maneria&quot; – the ancient manors of the Earl within Cornwall
#&quot;Forinseca maneria&quot; (foreign manors) – those manors outside Cornwall but attached to the duchy by the creation charter
#&quot;Annexata maneria&quot;, or annexed manors – those manors added to the Duchy holdings following its creation as a county palatine

The estates are the source of land management work for seven offices:

*London Head Office
*Hereford Office, Dewsall, Hereford
*Eastern District Office, Newton St Loe, Somerset
*Poundbury Office, Poundbury, Dorchester, Dorset
*Western District Office, Restormel Manor, Lostwithiel, Cornwall
*Dartmoor Office, Dartmoor, Yelverton, Devon
*Isles of Scilly Office, Hugh Town, Isles of Scilly

Most property is tenanted out, particularly farmland, while the forest land and holiday cottages are managed directly by the Duchy. The estate&#x27;s holiday cottage business is centred on Restormel Manor, near Lostwithiel.

The Duchy owns The Oval cricket ground in London, which was built on land in Kennington that formed part of the original Duchy estate. The Duchy has ventured into planned development with Poundbury, near Dorchester in Dorset.

===Planned developments===
Besides Poundbury, the duchy is involved with Nansledan, a 540-acre extension to the coastal town of Newquay, Cornwall. In 2012, work began on a 174-home development at Tregunnel Hill, southwest of Newquay, referred to locally as &quot;Surfbury&quot;, after the Poundbury project in Dorset. Plans were approved in December 2013 that would include 800 homes, shops, a supermarket and a primary school. The intention is that Nansledan will evolve into a community of more than 4,000 homes supporting a similar number of jobs.

In February 2024, Prince William, in partnership with Cornish charity St Petrocs, announced plans for building 24 homes on Duchy of Cornwall land in Nansledan to provide temporary accommodation for people experiencing homelessness in the area. Future plans include building more than 400 social rented homes and a further 475 affordable dwellings in South East Faversham.

==Legal status and additional rights==
Both the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster—since 1399 held by the monarch in a personal capacity—have special legal rights not available to other landed estates: for example, the rules on &quot;bona vacantia&quot;, the right to ownerless property, operate in favour of the holders of the duchies rather than the Crown, such that the property of anyone who dies in the county of Cornwall without a will or identifiable heirs, and assets belonging to dissolved companies whose registered office was in Cornwall, pass to the duchy.

In 2007, £130,000 was realised from the right of &quot;bona vacantia&quot;, and given to a charitable fund. The duke owns freehold about three-fifths of the Cornish foreshore and the &#x27;fundus&#x27;, or bed, of navigable rivers and has right of wreck on all ships wrecked on Cornish shores, including those afloat offshore, and also to royal fish—i.e. whales, porpoises, and sturgeon. The Duchy of Cornwall is the harbour authority for St Mary&#x27;s Harbour. There are separate attorneys-general for the duchies. The High Sheriff of Cornwall is appointed by the Duke of Cornwall, not the monarch, in contrast to the other counties of England and Wales. The duke had a ceremonial role in summoning the Cornish Stannary Parliament.

In &quot;Bruton v. ICO&quot; the first tier tribunal found that the duchy was a public authority for the purposes of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2011 that, since 2005, the Prince of Wales has been asked to give his consent to a number of draft bills on matters ranging from town planning to gambling, because it could affect the interests of the Duchy of Cornwall. Andrew George, Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives, commented that &quot;The duchy asserts that it is merely a private estate. Most people will be astonished to learn that it appears to have effective powers of veto over the government.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, lawyer David Gollancz commented that: &quot;The duchy exercises a unique range of legal powers, which elsewhere are reserved for the crown... It seems anomalous, and worrying, that such a huge estate, created and conferred by law and exercising significant legal powers, should be able to escape public scrutiny by calling itself a private estate.&quot;

The requirement for the Prince of Wales to give consent to draft bills that could affect the interests of the Duchy of Cornwall is not a new power granted to the Prince, but a centuries-old parliamentary practice that involved the same requirement for consent being conferred on previous dukes of Cornwall (&quot;see Prince&#x27;s Consent&quot;).

For some Cornish activists, Cornwall itself is described, &quot;de jure&quot;, as a duchy as opposed to an ordinary county, and the duchy estates are distinguished from the duchy itself, having themselves been annexed and united to &quot;the aforesaid duchy&quot;. The Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1973 recommended that Cornwall be officially referred to as &quot;the duchy&quot; on what it described as &quot;appropriate occasions&quot; given the nature of the county&#x27;s &quot;special relationship&quot; with the Crown. The designation is sometimes found used informally in respect of the county as whole.

Historically all justices of the assizes who visited Cornwall were also permanent members of the Prince&#x27;s Council which oversees the Duchy of Cornwall and advises the duke. There are on record at least three instances in which the prince overruled the king by instructing his officials to ignore or disobey orders issued to them by the King&#x27;s Chancery.

==Taxation==
The government considers the duchy to be a Crown body and therefore exempt from paying corporation tax. The tax position of the duchy has been challenged by British republicans. In 2012, following a ruling that the duchy was separate from, the then, Prince Charles for the purposes of regulation, Republic (the campaign for an elected head of state) asked HM Revenue and Customs to investigate whether the duchy should still be exempt from tax. The tax exemption is based on the assumption that the duchy estate is inseparable from the tax exempt person of Prince Charles.

Since 1993, the Prince of Wales has voluntarily paid income tax on the duchy income less amounts which he considers to be official expenditure. Prince Charles paid a voluntary contribution to the treasury of 50% of his Duchy income from the time he became eligible for its full income at the age of 21 in 1969, and paid 25% from his marriage in 1981 until the current arrangement commenced in 1993. Tax is calculated after deducting official expenditure, the biggest source of which is the Prince&#x27;s staff of about 110 who assist with his performance of official duties, including private secretaries and a valet working in his office at Clarence House and at Highgrove House. The official expenditure of the Prince of Wales is not audited by the National Audit Office.

==Coat of arms==
==Loyal Toast==
Traditionally, Cornish people refer to the Duke of Cornwall in the Loyal Toast, much like the Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands, or the Duke of Lancaster in the county palatine of Lancaster (Lancashire).

<text>Martina Mariea McBride (née Schiff, July 29, 1966) is an American country music singer and songwriter. She is known for her soprano singing range and her country pop material.

McBride was born in Sharon, Kansas, and relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1989. She signed to RCA Records in 1991, and made her debut the following year as a neo-traditionalist country singer with the single, &quot;The Time Has Come&quot;. Over time, she developed a pop-styled crossover sound, similar to Shania Twain and Faith Hill, and had a string of major hit singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and occasionally on the adult contemporary chart. Five of these singles went to No. 1 on the country chart between 1995 and 2001, and one peaked at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart in 2003.

McBride has fourteen studio albums, two greatest hits compilations, one &quot;live&quot; album, as well as two additional compilation albums. Eight of her studio albums and two of her compilations have an RIAA Gold certification, or higher. In the U.S., she has sold over 14 million albums. In addition, McBride has won the Country Music Association Award for Female Vocalist of the Year award four times (tied with Reba McEntire for the third-most wins) and the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s &quot;Top Female Vocalist&quot; award three times. She is also a 14-time Grammy Award nominee.

==Early life==
Martina Mariea Schiff was born in Sharon, Kansas, on July 29, 1966. She has two brothers, Martin and Steve, who play in her concert band as of 2017, and a sister, Gina.

McBride&#x27;s parents, Daryl and Jeanne Schiff, owned a dairy farm. Daryl, who was also a cabinetry shop owner, exposed her to country music at a young age. Listening to country music helped her acquire a love for singing. After school, she sang for hours along to the records of such popular artists as Reba McEntire, Linda Ronstadt, Juice Newton, Jeanne Pruett, Connie Smith, and Patsy Cline. Around the age of eight or nine, Martina began singing with a band her father fronted, &quot;The Schiffters&quot;. As she grew older her role in the band progressively increased, from simply singing, to also playing keyboard with them. She enjoyed performing in her early years.

McBride began performing with a local rock band, The Penetrators, in Wichita instead. Then, in 1987, Schiff gathered a group of musicians called Lotus and started looking for rehearsal space; she began renting space from studio engineer John McBride. In 1988, the two married.

After marrying, the couple moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1989 with the hope of beginning a career in country music. John McBride joined Garth Brooks&#x27;s sound crew and later became his concert production manager. Martina occasionally joined her husband on the road and helped sell Garth Brooks souvenirs. In 1990, impressed by her enthusiastic spirit, Brooks offered her the position of his opening act provided she could obtain a recording contract. During this time, while her husband was working with country artists Charlie Daniels and Ricky Van Shelton, he also helped produce her demo tape, which helped her gain a recording contract with RCA Nashville Records in 1991.

==Music career==
===1992–1995: &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; and &quot;The Way That I Am&quot;===
McBride released her debut studio album by RCA Records in 1992, titled &quot;The Time Has Come&quot;. It was produced by Paul Worley and Ed Seay. This album&#x27;s title track made it to number 23 on the country music charts, while the next two singles both failed to make the Top 40. Unlike her later country pop-influenced albums, &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; featured honky tonk and country folk influences.

&quot;The Way That I Am&quot; was McBride&#x27;s second album. Its first two singles both brought her into the country top ten: &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot;, the album&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; title song, peaked at number two, and &quot;Life No. 9&quot; peaked at number six. The former was previously a Top 10 hit in Canada for Patricia Conroy. However, it was the third single, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which was prevented from reaching the Top 10 through the oppositions of many radio programmers, who objected to the song&#x27;s subject of a mother fighting back against abuse by burning the family home to the ground. &quot;Independence Day&quot; won Video of the Year and Song of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards, and has since become McBride&#x27;s signature song. It also earned the song&#x27;s composer, Gretchen Peters, a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Country Song. The song also gave McBride a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. McBride performed the song at the 1995 Grammys ceremony. The fourth and fifth singles from &quot;The Way That I Am&quot; were less successful: &quot;Heart Trouble&quot; peaked at number 21, and &quot;Where I Used to Have a Heart&quot; fell short of the Top 40. McBride later criticized these single choices, saying that she felt &quot;Strangers&quot; would have been a better followup, as that song was more popular with fans and later appeared on her first greatest-hits album. &quot;The Way That I Am&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

&quot;My Baby Loves Me (Just The Way That I Am)&quot;, as produced and released, proved to have a sing-along quality that led McBride to sing it that way in her subsequent concerts.

===1995–1999: &quot;Wild Angels&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;===
McBride&#x27;s third album, &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, was released in 1995. It accounted for another Top 5 hit in its lead single &quot;Safe in the Arms of Love&quot;, which had previously been recorded by both Wild Choir and Baillie &amp; the Boys, and was concurrently released in Canada by Michelle Wright at the time of McBride&#x27;s version. The album&#x27;s title track went on to become McBride&#x27;s first No. 1 single on the country charts in early 1996. The album&#x27;s third, fourth, and fifth singles, &quot;Phones Are Ringin&#x27; All Over Town&quot;, &quot;Swingin&#x27; Doors&quot;, and &quot;Cry on the Shoulder of the Road&quot; were less successful, having reached the lower regions of the Top 40.

In early 1997, after &quot;Cry on the Shoulder of the Road&quot; peaked, McBride released two duets. &quot;Still Holding On&quot;, a duet with Clint Black which was the lead-off single to her fourth album &quot;Evolution&quot; and Black&#x27;s album &quot;Nothin&#x27; but the Taillights&quot;, and &quot;Valentine&quot;, a collaboration with pop pianist Jim Brickman which appeared on his album &quot;Picture This&quot;. She also sang duet vocals on &quot;Chances Are&quot; with Bob Seger, featured on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture Hope Floats.

She had her second number one on the country charts with &quot;A Broken Wing&quot;, the second single from her &quot;Evolution&quot; album, in late 1997. &quot;Evolution&quot; went on to produce four more Top 10 hits at country radio: a re-release of &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;Happy Girl&quot;, &quot;Wrong Again&quot; (which also went to number one), and &quot;Whatever You Say&quot;. Towards the end of 1998, the album was certified double platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling two million units. In addition, she also won the Country Music Association Awards&#x27; &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; award in 1999 and also performed for President Bill Clinton during the same time.

Also in 1998, McBride released her first Christmas album titled &quot;White Christmas&quot;, which featured a rendition of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; that first charted in 1997 and continued to re-enter the charts until 2001. She also sang a guest vocal on Jason Sellers&#x27; mid-1998 single &quot;This Small Divide&quot;.

===1999–2002: &quot;Emotion&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===

McBride&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Emotion,&quot; was released in 1999. Its lead single, &quot;I Love You&quot;, reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts in 1999, and also crossed over to the Adult Contemporary chart. The song&#x27;s follow-ups, &quot;Love&#x27;s the Only House&quot; and &quot;There You Are&quot;, both made the Top 5 at country radio, and &quot;It&#x27;s My Time&quot; peaked at number 11.

In 2001, she released her first compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. This album has been certified 3× Platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America, and is her highest-selling album. It included most of her major hits to that point, and the album track &quot;Strangers&quot; from the album &quot;The Way That I Am&quot;, which she put on the album because she felt that it should have been a single. The album also included four new songs, all of which were Top 10 hit on the country music charts between 2001 and 2003: &quot;When God-Fearin&#x27; Women Get the Blues&quot; (at number 8), &quot;Blessed&quot; (at number 1), &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; (at number 3), and &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; (at number 5). Carolyn Dawn Johnson sang backing vocals on &quot;Blessed&quot;; conversely, McBride sang backing vocals on Johnson&#x27;s late-2000 debut single, titled &quot;Georgia&quot;. Late in 2002, McBride also sang backing vocals on Andy Griggs&#x27;s single &quot;Practice Life&quot;.

===2003–04: &quot;Martina&quot;===
In 2003, McBride released her seventh studio album, &quot;Martina,&quot; which celebrated womanhood. The first single, &quot;This One&#x27;s for the Girls&quot;, went to number 3 on the country charts and became her only number-one hit on the Adult Contemporary charts. It also included backing vocals from Faith Hill, Carolyn Dawn Johnson, and McBride&#x27;s daughters, Delaney and Emma. Follow-up single &quot;In My Daughter&#x27;s Eyes&quot; was also a Top 5 hit at both country and adult contemporary. &quot;How Far&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Will&quot; both made the Top 20 at country radio, as did her guest appearance on Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s single &quot;Trip Around the Sun&quot;, whose chart run overlapped that of &quot;God&#x27;s Will&quot;.

In 2004, McBride won the CMA&#x27;s Female Vocalist award for the fourth time, following the wins in 2003, 2002 and 1999, which tied her for the most wins in that category with Reba McEntire.

===2005–2008: &quot;Timeless&quot; and &quot;Waking Up Laughing&quot;===
After finding success in country pop-styled music, McBride released her next studio album, &quot;Timeless&quot;, in 2005, which consisted of country covers. The album included cover versions of country music standards, such as Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;You Win Again&quot;, Loretta Lynn&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough&quot;, and Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;. To make the album fit its older style, McBride and her husband hired older Nashville session players and outdated analog equipment. The album sold over 250,000 copies within its first week, the highest sales start for a McBride album. The lead single, a cover of Lynn Anderson&#x27;s &quot;(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden&quot;, went to number 18 on the country charts, but the other two singles both failed to make top 40.

In 2006, McBride served as a guest coach on &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. The remaining five finalists traveled to Nashville, where McBride worked with the competitors on the songs they had chosen by country artists such as Gordon Lightfoot and Patsy Cline. Among the other guest judges that year were Nelly Furtado and Cyndi Lauper.
McBride later joined Canadian Idol on a tour in the Spring.
In 2007, McBride also served as a guest coach on Fox Networks television series, &quot;American Idol.&quot;

In 2007, McBride released her ninth studio album, &quot;Waking Up Laughing&quot;. It was the first album in which McBride co-wrote some of the tracks. She set up her Waking Up Laughing Tour in 2007, which included country artists Rodney Atkins, Little Big Town, and Jason Michael Carroll. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Anyway&quot;, went to No. 5 on the Billboard Country Chart, becoming her first Top 10 hit since 2003. She also lent her voice singing &quot;Anyway&quot; in a Lifetime movie called, &quot;A Life Interrupted&quot; which premiered on April 23, 2007. Its follow-up, &quot;How I Feel&quot;, reached the Top 15. In Spring 2008, McBride released &quot;Martina McBride: Live In Concert&quot;, a CD/DVD set. It was taped in Moline, Illinois in September 2007.

In July 2007, The ABC Television Network announced a special program called &quot;Six Degrees of Martina McBride&quot; where individuals from around the country were challenged to find their way to McBride on their own connections and research using a maximum of six methods. The &quot;winner&quot; of this challenge eventually located a direct connection to McBride through her husband, John, who knew someone, who knew someone else.
McBride recorded an electronically produced duet with Elvis Presley, performing his song &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; as a duet with him on his latest compilation, &quot;The Elvis Presley Christmas Duets&quot;. A compilation collection, titled &quot;&quot;, was released on December 16, 2008, as part of Sony BMG Playlist series. The album features 11 previously released tracks and three unreleased tracks.

===2008–2010: &quot;Shine&quot;===
McBride wrapped up production of her tenth studio album in late 2008. The first single, &quot;Ride&quot;, was released to radio in October 2008 and debuted at No. No. 43 on the Hot Country Songs chart. It barely missed the Top 10 on the chart, peaking at number eleven in March 2009. A music video produced by Kristin Barlowe was also released at the end of the year. The album, &quot;Shine&quot;, was released by RCA Records on March 24, 2009, and debuted at the top of the U.S. Country album chart and number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. McBride co-produced the album with Dann Huff, and it featured &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot;, a song that she co-wrote. The second single, &quot;I Just Call You Mine&quot;, was released in May 2009 and reached the Top 20. The third single from &quot;Shine&quot; was &quot;Wrong Baby Wrong Baby Wrong&quot;, which the Warren Brothers co-wrote with Robert Ellis Orrall and Love and Theft member Stephen Barker Liles.

McBride also initiated the Shine All Night Tour, a co-headlining venture with fellow country star and friend Trace Adkins and opening act Sarah Buxton. The tour began in November 2009 and ended in May 2010.

On June 10, 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that McBride had collaborated on a song with Kid Rock. In late June 2010, McBride was nominated for a Teen Choice Award, &quot;Favorite Country Female Artist&quot;, alongside country stars Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert, Taylor Swift and Gretchen Wilson.

In late 2010, McBride was nominated for two American Country Awards (Best Female Single &amp; Touring Artist of the year w/ Trace Adkins.) Along with the ACA nominations, she received her 14th Female Vocalist nomination for Country Music Association in October.

===2010–2016: &quot;Eleven&quot; and &quot;Everlasting&quot;===

McBride exited RCA in November 2010 and signed with Republic Nashville. She began working on a new studio album with producer Byron Gallimore. Her first single for Republic Nashville is &quot;Teenage Daughters&quot;, which she also co-wrote with the Warren Brothers. McBride told &quot;Country Weekly&quot; that she co-wrote eight of the eleven songs on the album; she decided to write more frequently because she felt more confident in her songwriting ability after &quot;Anyway&quot; had become a hit. An album track, &quot;One Night&quot; was released as a promotion for NASCAR with a music video in June 2011.

&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Love You Through It&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on July 25, 2011. The song became a critical and commercial hit, peaking at number 4 and becoming her first top five hit since 2006&#x27;s &quot;Anyway&quot;. The album, titled &quot;Eleven&quot;, was released on October 11, 2011. Its third single was a cover of Train&#x27;s &quot;Marry Me&quot;, recorded as a duet with Train lead singer Pat Monahan. In September 2011, McBride was nominated for the CMA&#x27;s Female Vocalist award for the 15th time, and 14th time consecutively.

RCA Records released two compilation albums in 2012, &quot;Hits and More&quot; in January and &quot;The Essential Martina McBride&quot; in October.

McBride released &quot;Everlasting&quot;, a collection of R&amp;B and Soul covers, on April 8, 2014, via Kobalt Label Services. The album includes duets with Kelly Clarkson and Gavin DeGraw, and was produced by Don Was.

In September 2014, McBride received her 17th Female Vocalist nomination from the Country Music Association. She was tied with Reba McEntire for most nominations in any vocalist category, until McEntire&#x27;s 18th nomination in 2017.

===2016–present: &quot;Reckless&quot; and &quot;Vocal Point&quot; podcast===
In 2016, McBride released a new single called &quot;Reckless&quot;, the title track for a new album. &quot;Reckless&quot; was released on April 29 through Nash Icon Records. It was recorded at Blackbird Studios and produced by Nathan Chapman and Dann Huff. The album includes 10 songs, one of which is the previously released single &quot;Reckless&quot;. According to McBride, making this album felt like &quot;coming home&quot;. &quot;Reckless&quot; debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums Chart.

On June 8, 2016, McBride debuted the video for her second single, &quot;Just Around The Corner&quot;, during the CMT Music Awards. This song is the official Band Against Cancer anthem. Band Against Cancer is a community-based movement led by Sarah Cannon (the cancer institute of HCA) in partnership with Big Machine Label Group and McBride, which aims to raise awareness, support and resources to those diagnosed with cancer. The initiative includes a series of concerts across United States, with McBride as a headliner.

In August 2016, the singer announced a new tour called &quot;Love Unleashed&quot;. According to McBride, the purpose of the tour was to unite people and spread love through the power of music as a response to the &quot;tragedy and uncertainty in the world&quot;. She was also selected as one of 30 artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track of Take Me Home, Country Roads; On the Road Again; and I Will Always Love You which celebrated 50 years of the CMA Awards.

In July 2017, McBride revealed she is planning on releasing a Christmas album, of which she said &quot; It won&#x27;t have as many hymns on it. It will be more things like &#x27;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; To Town&#x27; and &#x27;It&#x27;s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas.&#x27;&quot; She later announced that it would be released in 2018, &quot;One is a new Christmas album, which will come out in 2018.&quot; The Christmas album &quot;It&#x27;s the Holiday Season&quot; was released on October 19, 2018. Its release would accompany a Christmas tour, called &quot;Joy of Christmas&quot; as well as a cookbook called &quot;Martina&#x27;s Kitchen Mix: My Recipe Playlist for Real Life&quot; released on October 30, 2018. This was McBride&#x27;s second cookbook, following her 2014 release called &quot;Around the Table: Recipes and Inspiration for Gatherings Throughout the Year&quot;. McBride also launched a show on Food Network, airing on Sundays at 11am eastern.

In 2019, McBride began the podcast &quot;Vocal Point&quot;, a &quot;free-wheeling, wide-ranging&quot; topical conversation series.

On May 4, 2020, McBride appeared in the second-season episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Songland&quot; and released the song &quot;Girls Like Me&quot;.

In March 2022, McBride sold her Master Royalty Rights to Primary Wave. The company also took ownership and distribution rights for her &quot;Everlasting&quot; album and the singer&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s the Holiday Season&quot; Christmas album. McBride was announced as the opening act for The Judds Final Tour, scheduled to begin in summer 2022. However, Naomi Judd died before the tour could begin. Her daughter, Wynonna, announced at her memorial that she and McBride would honor the tour dates as a tribute to Naomi.

==Personal life==
In 1988, Martina Schiff, as she was known up to that time, married sound engineer John McBride, taking his family name as her stage name. The couple has three daughters: Delaney Katharine (born December 22, 1994), Emma Justine (born March 29, 1998), and Ava Rose Kathleen (born June 20, 2005). After becoming a mother, the singer reduced her touring schedule so that her daughters could have a normal upbringing. Joe Galante said this was &quot;an enormous choice in terms of money&quot;, but McBride had made it very clear that she wanted to be present in her daughters&#x27; lives.

==Charity work==
McBride works with a variety of charities. She has served as a spokeswoman for the National Domestic Violence Hotline as well as for the National Network to End Domestic Violence and national spokeswoman for the &quot;Tulsa Domestic Violence and Intervention Services&quot;. Every year since 1995, she has hosted Middle Tennessee&#x27;s YWCA, &quot;Celebrity Auction&quot;, and it has raised nearly $400,000 so far. McBride was awarded the &quot;Minnie Pearl Humanitarian Award&quot; in 2003. In 2004, she worked with &quot;Kids Wish Network&quot; to fulfill the wish of a young girl dying from muscular dystrophy.

McBride explained that educating girls and women on domestic violence is something she works on at home with her own daughters, stating:

McBride has also teamed up with Loveisrespect, National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline, working with them on a new program called, &quot;My Time to Shine&quot;.

McBride appeared on the Stand Up 2 Cancer Telethon in September 2010, where she performed &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; with Leona Lewis, Aaron Neville, and Stevie Wonder. Also in 2010, she hosted the YWCA for the 16th consecutive year, raising over $50,000. It totals over $500,000 raised so far.

McBride also has a charity initiative called &quot;Team Music is Love&quot;. Speaking about Team Music Is Love, McBride stated &quot;It started a few years ago as a group of fans that asked me if they could wear a T-shirt with my name to walk in a breast cancer walk, and I said &#x27;of course&#x27; and it has grown from there. Last year, we decided we wanted to give it a better name, a name that sounded as important as it is, so we changed it to &#x27;Team Music is Love,&#x27; since it&#x27;s about spreading love through music. We have done some amazing things over the past few years and we continue to grow and keep giving back.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
McBride has received a number of awards, including the Country Music Association Award (CMA) for Female Vocalist of the Year, with her fourth win in 2004. In 2011 she received and honorary CMA award. She has been nominated for 14 Grammy Awards, but has never won.

===Grammy Awards===

&quot;Note&quot;: In 1995, McBride was one of the various artists featured on the album &quot;Amazing Grace – A Country Salute to Gospel&quot; (singing &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;), which won the Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album. This award went to the compilation album&#x27;s producer Bill Hearn, and not to the artists.

<text>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is one of the institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

NIH is the primary federal agency that conducts and supports basic, clinical and translational medical research. The institute investigates the prevention, diagnosis, causes, treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases.

==Mission==

NIAMS&#x27; mission is to support the research of arthritis, musculoskeletal and skin diseases. The institute also disseminates information on research progress in these diseases. NIAMS supports and conducts basic, clinical, translational and epidemiologic research and research training at universities and medical centers.

The institute also conducts and supports basic research on the normal structure and function of bones, joints, muscles, and skin. Basic research involves a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including immunology, genetics, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, physiology, virology, and pharmacology. Clinical research includes rheumatology, orthopedics, dermatology, metabolic bone diseases, heritable disorders of bone and cartilage, inherited and inflammatory muscle diseases, and sports and rehabilitation medicine.

==Legislative chronology==
August 1950—An arthritis program was established within the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases under Public Law 81-692.

May 1972—P.L. 92-305 renamed the institute the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases.

1973—Senator Alan Cranston introduced legislation that would eventually lead to the National Arthritis Act. Companion legislation was introduced in the House by Congressman Paul Rogers.

January 1975—The National Arthritis Act (P.L. 93-640) established the National Commission on Arthritis and Related Musculoskeletal Diseases to study the problem of arthritis and to develop an arthritis plan. The act established the position of Associate Director for arthritis and related musculoskeletal diseases and authorized an interagency arthritis coordinating committee; community demonstration project grants; an arthritis data bank; an information clearinghouse; and comprehensive centers for research, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and education.

April 1976—After a year of study and public hearings, the commission issued a comprehensive plan aimed at diminishing the physical, economic and psychosocial effects of arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases. It laid the groundwork for a national program encompassing research, research training, education and patient care.

October 1976—The Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive Diseases Amendments of 1976 (P.L. 94-562) established the National Arthritis Advisory Board to review and evaluate the implementation of the Arthritis Plan, prepared in response to the National Arthritis Act (P.L. 93-640).

December 1980—P.L. 96-538 changed the name of the institute to the National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

1982—HHS conferred bureau status on the institute, resulting in the creation of the Division of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the appointment of a Division Director.

November 1985—The Health Research Extension Act of 1985, P.L. 99-158, established the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases to increase research emphasis. The legislation provided for the development of a plan for a national arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases program and established two interagency coordinating committees, one on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases and one on skin diseases. It also expanded the activities of the National Arthritis Advisory Board to include these diseases.

September 1993—The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-43) directed NIAMS to establish &quot;an information clearinghouse on osteoporosis and related bone disorders to facilitate and enhance knowledge and understanding on the part of health professionals, patients, and the public through the effective dissemination of information.&quot;

October 2000—The Children&#x27;s Health Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-310) directed NIAMS to expand and intensify research programs on juvenile arthritis and related conditions, in coordination with other NIH Institutes and the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases Interagency Coordinating Committee. The institute directed to include resources on juvenile arthritis and associated conditions in its clearinghouse.

November 2000—The Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 2000, which passed as part of the Public Health Improvement Act (P.L. 106-505), required NIAMS to expand and intensify research and related activities regarding lupus. Among other provisions, the bill called for information and education programs.

December 2001—The Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research, and Education Amendments of 2001, or the MD-CARE Act (P.L. 107-84), called on several components of the NIH, including the NIAMS, to enhance research on muscular dystrophy, including establishing centers of excellence.

February 2003—The Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY 2003 (P.L. 108-7) directed Office of the Secretary, HHS, to establish a federal working group on lupus for the purpose of exchanging information and coordinating federal efforts regarding lupus research and education initiatives. NIAMS led this federal working group. The group has representatives from all relevant HHS agencies and other federal departments.

October 2008—The Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research, and Education (MD-CARE) Amendments of 2008 (P.L. 110-361) officially named the related centers of excellence after the senator. In addition, the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee was authorized to give special consideration to enhance the clinical research infrastructure to test emerging therapies.

September 2014—The Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education (MD-CARE) Amendments of 2014 (P.L. 113-166) made several changes to the program’s authorization, including expanding the types of muscular dystrophy for which NIH must conduct research, expanding the membership of the MDCC and requiring it to meet two times each year, and expanding the items to be covered in the Action Plan for the Muscular Dystrophies.

Using an approach that integrates genomics, bioinformatics, and mechanistic investigations, the program aims to identify the causes of genetically complex autoinflammatory diseases, including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Behçet&#x27;s disease.

The Clinical Trials and Outcomes Branch conducts research on the health outcomes of patients with rheumatic diseases and orthopaedic conditions. Studies focus on the development and testing of measures of health and disease, identification of predictors of good and poor health outcomes, examination of treatment effectiveness, and investigations of socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in health outcomes. The Clinical Trials and Outcomes Branch also conducts studies on the outcomes of many important orthopaedic conditions. The studies use large clinical databases to investigate rare femur fractures, uncommon hip infections, and novel fracture treatments, as well as studying rare, genetic bone diseases. The goal is to provide clinical insights into conditions that cannot be examined in traditional clinical studies.

The Community Research and Care Branch coordinates activities within the NIAMS Community Health Clinic, a health information resource that provides health care services to underserved populations affected by arthritis, lupus, and other rheumatic diseases. The clinic offers patient care with access to specialists, education programs, and referral to clinical investigations for the prevention and treatment of rheumatic diseases.

The Autoimmunity Branch conducts basic and clinical research on the pathophysiology and treatment of autoimmune diseases. Signal transduction pathways that differentiate normal and pathological immune responses are studied in mouse models and human tissue samples to gain insights into how these processes drive autoimmune diseases, and how therapies that minimize generalized immune suppression can best be developed for these diseases.

The Branch focuses on the TNF-family of cytokines and their receptors, from basic investigation of the trafficking and signaling by these molecules to the study of human diseases involving TNF-family cytokines and their receptors. The Branch also studies intracellular signaling and how this leads to immune-mediated disease. Individuals with known or currently undiagnosed rare genetic syndromes are evaluated by genetic and biochemical investigations.

The Dermatology Branch investigates fundamental and clinical aspects of neoplastic and inflammatory skin disease as well as normal skin function, while also providing all dermatology patient care at the NIH Clinical Center. The Branch includes research focused on clinical and translational research in rare disease populations, including new clinical syndromes and trials of new therapies, and houses three sections devoted to cutaneous research areas. The Branch studies signaling pathways that regulate development and maintenance of normal skin, and the changes in these signals that occur during the formation of skin cancer. One area of focus is skin sensory neuroendocrine cells, Merkel cells, and the pathogenesis and treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). An important area of research for the Branch includes investigation of the skin microbiome in health and disease. The Branch also aims to extend knowledge of interactions of immune cells in skin and skin appendage niches, combining mouse genetics, bioinformatics, immunology and cell biology.

<text>Rhea Jo Perlman (born March 31, 1948) is an American actress. She is well-known for playing head waitress Carla Tortelli in the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; (1982–1993). Over the course of 11 seasons, Perlman was nominated for 10 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress, winning 4, and was nominated for a record six Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series. She has also appeared in films, including &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; (1995), &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996), &quot;The Sessions&quot; (2012), &quot;Poms&quot; (2019), and &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Perlman was born on March 31, 1948, in Coney Island, Brooklyn, to Philip Perlman, a Polish-Jewish immigrant who was a manager at a doll parts factory and Adele, a bookkeeper. She grew up in Bensonhurst in a Jewish family with additional roots in Russia. She has a sister, Heide, who is a television writer, story editor, and producer who worked on &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. In the mid-1980s, her parents moved to Los Angeles, and her father became an extra on &quot;Cheers&quot;. His character became known by his real name, Phil, and he managed to get a few lines over the years as he appeared in more than 30 episodes. He created a second career as a character actor, appearing in several films and television shows, including &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot;, &quot;Hoffa&quot;, and &quot;Frasier&quot;.

She studied drama at Hunter College in New York, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968.

== Career ==
===Career beginnings===

Perlman began her acting career with a small role as an attendant in the off-off-Broadway play &quot;Dracula Sabbat&quot;, which ran from September 1970 to June 1971. In 1972, she played a bit role in the film &quot;Hot Dogs for Gauguin&quot;. That same year she appeared in Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective&#x27;s production of &quot;Up – An Uppity Revue&quot;, along with her future husband, Danny DeVito.

One of her first notable parts was a recurring role on the television show &quot;Taxi&quot; as Zena, the sweet girlfriend of Louie De Palma (played by DeVito). Following that, she had a role in a small play portraying a much tougher character. Producers Glen and Les Charles saw her in that play, which led to her landing the role as wisecracking barmaid Carla Tortelli on their sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; in 1982. 

===&quot;Cheers&quot;===

The series struggled with ratings in its first season, but by the time it ended in 1993, it was one of the most popular and successful shows of all time, winning 20 Emmy awards out of 95 nominations.

Perlman won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy four times: in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1989. Over her 11 seasons on &quot;Cheers&quot;, she was nominated for an Emmy every year but 1992, becoming the &quot;Cheers&quot; star to have the most wins and nominations. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress six times, more than anyone else in that category. In 2011, NBC named Carla Tortelli as one of the greatest TV characters of all time.

In 1986, Perlman starred in an episode of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; titled &quot;The Wedding Ring,&quot; which also starred DeVito as her character&#x27;s husband.

===Motion pictures===
In the 1990s, Perlman starred in several TV movies and motion pictures. In 1992, she starred in the made-for-TV-movie, &quot;To Grandmother&#x27;s House We Go&quot; opposite Ashley Olsen and Mary-Kate Olsen, playing the wife of Jerry Van Dyke&#x27;s character; the couple kidnapped the Olsen Twins&#x27; characters, hoping to cash in on ransom before Christmas. Other TV films in which she starred included the dramas &quot;A Place to Be Loved&quot; and &quot;In Spite of Love.&quot; Perlman&#x27;s motion picture roles included &quot;There Goes The Neighborhood&quot; (1992), &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; (1995), &quot;Carpool&quot; (1996), &quot;Sunset Park&quot; (1996), and &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996). She had a cameo in the film &quot;10 Items Or Less&quot; (2006), and also starred in the 2007 independent film &quot;Love Comes Lately.&quot;

In 1994, Perlman voiced 9-Eye in The Timekeeper, a Circle-Vision show at the Magic Kingdom in Tomorrowland. She later starred in the 1996 sitcom &quot;Pearl&quot; as the title character and was featured on the 2001 TV drama &quot;Kate Brasher.&quot; Among her notable guest appearances was on the fourth-season premiere of &quot;Becker&quot;, which starred &quot;Cheers&quot; co-star Ted Danson. Perlman also appeared in a 2000 television film &quot;How to Marry a Billionaire: A Christmas Tale,&quot; in which she impersonated Jackie Kennedy. She also portrayed a therapist called Dr. Parella in the 2000 film &quot;Secret Cutting,&quot; which follows the story of a young girl named Dawn who self-injures. In 2007, Perlman appeared as Bertha in the West End of London in the comedy &quot;Boeing Boeing.&quot; In 2008, she starred in the Hallmark Channel original movie, &quot;The Christmas Choir,&quot; and appeared in &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Big Break&quot; in 2008 as Patricia Benji. In 2009, she appeared as Tanya&#x27;s mother on the series &quot;Hung&quot; for Home Box Office Networks. In 2011, Perlman had a guest appearance as Mittens in one episode of &quot;Wilfred.&quot;

In 2009, Perlman and her daughter Lucy DeVito starred in the off-Broadway play &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;, adapted by Nora and Delia Ephron, at the Westside Theatre. From 2014 to 2017, she starred in a recurring role on &quot;The Mindy Project&quot; as Danny&#x27;s mother, Annette Castellano.

In 2023, Perlman earned critical praise for playing Barbie creator Ruth Handler in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s film &quot;Barbie&quot;.

=== Writing ===
Perlman is the author of the illustrated children&#x27;s book series &quot;Otto Undercover,&quot; whose six books to date (as of the middle of May 2012) are &quot;Born to Drive,&quot; &quot;Canyon Catastrophe,&quot; &quot;Water Balloon Doom,&quot; &quot;Toxic Taffy Takeover,&quot; &quot;The Brink of Ex-stink-tion,&quot; and &quot;Brain Freeze.&quot;

==Personal life==
 Perlman met Danny DeVito on January 17, 1971, when she went to see a friend in the single performance of the play &quot;The Shrinking Bride&quot;, which also featured DeVito. They moved in together two weeks after meeting and married on January 28, 1982. They have three children: Lucy Chet DeVito, Grace Fan DeVito, and Jacob Daniel DeVito. Perlman, who is Jewish, and DeVito, who was raised Catholic, raised their children celebrating the major holidays of both religions but did not give their children any religious identity. Perlman told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1998: &quot;We do all the holidays to keep the traditions and the culture going, but I truly don&#x27;t have a great feeling about any particular organized religion, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to impose one on my kids. I feel like I&#x27;m bringing them up to be good people, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s about.&quot; In addition to their three children, the couple have two grandchildren.

The family resided in Beverly Hills, California, and they owned a vacation home in Interlaken, New Jersey that they frequented to get away from Los Angeles. Throughout their relationship, Perlman and DeVito have acted alongside each other several times, including in the TV show &quot;Taxi&quot; and the feature film &quot;Matilda&quot;.

Perlman and DeVito separated in October 2012. However, in March 2013, it was reported that they had reconciled. The couple later separated again for a second time in March 2017 on amicable terms. Although the two no longer live together, Perlman said she has no intention of divorcing DeVito. In 2019, Perlman told interviewer Andy Cohen that she and DeVito have become closer friends after their separation than they were in their final years as a couple.

<text>Spondyloarthritis (SpA), also known as spondyloarthropathy, is a collection of syndromes connected by genetic predisposition and clinical symptoms. The best-known subtypes are enteropathic arthritis (EA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and reactive arthritis (ReA). Symptoms of spondyloarthritis include back pain, arthritis, and enthesitis, inflammation at bone-adhering ligaments, tendons, or joint capsules.

Spondyloarthritis is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is associated with intestinal inflammation, with a connection between Crohn&#x27;s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. Reactive arthritis is primarily caused by gastrointestinal, genitourinary, respiratory infections, and genetic factors.

Spondyloarthritis is diagnosed based on symptoms and imaging. Early diagnosis criteria use genetic testing and more advanced forms of medical imaging. Spondyloarthritis is categorized into two groups based on the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria: primarily axial involvement and predominantly peripheral manifestations.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are administered first for active axial signs of spondyloarthritis. If NSAIDs are contraindicated or cause side effects, TNF blockers are used. Traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are not used for people without peripheral disease signs.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In all subtypes of spondyloarthritis, inflammatory back pain and/or asymmetrical arthritis, mainly affecting the lower limbs, are the most common symptoms. Another characteristic is enthesitis, which is inflammation at the locations where ligaments, tendons, or joint capsules adhere to bone.

Inflammatory back pain associated with ankylosing spondylitis usually starts slowly, has a dull feel to it, and spreads into the gluteal areas. Back pain has a nocturnal component, gets better with movement, and is worse in the morning. Axial arthritis may begin in the sacroiliac joints and work its way up to the cervical spine over time. Spinal abnormalities such as flattening of the lumbar lordosis, exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis, and hyperextension of the cervical spine lead to limited spinal motion. Hip and shoulder arthritis can occur in some people with ankylosing spondylitis, usually early in the course of the illness. Usually, the other peripheral joints start to be affected later. Most frequently, there is an asymmetrical involvement of the lower extremities.

Reactive arthritis is an aseptic arthritis caused by an infectious pathogen found outside the joint. Particularly affecting the joints in the lower limbs, the arthritis is usually oligoarticular. In most cases, the condition develops quickly; two to four joints may swell and hurt in an uneven manner within a few days. Inflammatory back pain and dactylitis are also prevalent.

Psoriatic arthritis is known to present in five distinct patterns: oligoarticular (affecting four or fewer joints); polyarticular (affecting five or more joints); prominent distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint involvement; arthritis mutilans; and psoriatic spondylitis. More than 70% of cases follow the oligoarticular pattern. Distal joints are frequently impacted by psoriatic arthritis, which is typically asymmetrical.

Up to 20% of people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop spondyloarthropathy. Those with Crohn&#x27;s disease are more likely to have this association than those with ulcerative colitis. Arthritis may appear before bowel disease. Usually, the lower extremities are asymmetrically affected by arthritis. The arthritis typically manifests abruptly and follows a migratory pattern.

In those who do not fit the criteria for any of the well-established spondyloarthropathies, the term &quot;undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy&quot; is used to characterize the signs of spondyloarthritis. A tiny percentage of these eventually experience a characterized spondyloarthritis, but most experience more general symptoms such as dactylitis, enthesitis, unilateral or alternating buttock pain, inflammatory back pain, and occasionally extra-articular symptoms.

== Causes ==
Spondyloarthritis is caused by a complicated combination of genetic polymorphisms and environment. The relative contributions of genes and environment may differ across different types of spondyloarthritis.

=== Risk factors ===
Microscopically visible ileal inflammation is seen in about 50% of people with spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis during ileocolonoscopy. There seems to be an immunological connection between the gut inflammation observed in Crohn&#x27;s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. It is known that, in comparison to healthy controls, people with ankylosing spondylitis and those related to them have higher intestinal permeability.

=== Triggers ===
The majority of organisms responsible for reactive arthritis are gastrointestinal pathogens, such as &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot;, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; and &quot;Yersinia pseudotuberculosis&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; and &quot;Campylobacter coli&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp. Genitourinary and respiratory infections, such as &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; and &quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot;, have also been linked to reactive arthritis.

=== Genetics ===
Given the well-established familial aggregation and the concordance rate of up to 63% in identical twins (vs 23% in nonidentical twins), it is evident that genetic variables play a role in the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis. There is limited research on familial aggregation in other forms of spondyloarthritis.

HLA-B27 is a polymorphic form of the HLA-B molecule found in up to 95% of people with ankylosing spondylitis of European ancestry, 70% with reactive arthritis, 60% with psoriatic spondylitis, 25% with peripheral psoriatic arthritis, and 70% with spondylitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

== Mechanism ==

The arthritogenic-peptide theory is the classic pathophysiological paradigm for spondyloarthritis. It argues that HLA-B27 displays self-peptides that resemble pathogen-derived peptides to CD8-restricted T cells. Two other theories have been proposed to explain HLA-B27&#x27;s function. They suggest that HLA-B27&#x27;s genesis may be autoinflammatory rather than autoimmune, as it plays a part in initiating innate immune responses instead of its traditional function of presenting antigens.

According to the first hypothesis, HLA-B27 heavy chains devoid of β2 microglobulin can form disulphide-linked homodimers that are produced at the cell surface and can be recognized directly by KIR3DL2 killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, regardless of the associated peptide.

According to the second hypothesis, the B pocket&#x27;s Cys 67 residue causes HLA-B27 heavy-chain misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum before assembling into complexes with peptide and β2 microglobulin. As a result, the unfolded protein response (UPR) modifies the immune cells&#x27; cytokine output and reactivity to various innate immunological stimuli.

== Diagnosis ==
Spondyloarthritis is primarily diagnosed, or at least first suspected, based on clinical factors. According to the current criteria for ankylosing spondylitis, a person must exhibit clinical symptoms of inflammatory back pain and limited spinal mobility together with radiological sacroiliitis. But many people with inflammatory back pain may have no radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis since up to 10 years might pass between the onset of inflammatory back pain and the development of radiographic sacroiliitis. Criteria for the early diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis have been developed in light of the emergence of effective treatments. These criteria consider the added value of HLA-B27 testing, as well as current advancements in MRI scanning.

Imaging is crucial to the spondyloarthritis diagnosis process. The most distinctive radiographic observation is the sacroiliac (SI) joints&#x27; erosion, ankylosis, and sclerosis. There must be clear evidence of sacroiliitis (at least grade 2 bilaterally or grade 3 unilaterally) on the radiographs to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis. When axial spondyloarthritis is suspected, sacroiliac joint radiographs are still the initial imaging approach. If radiographs clearly show sacroiliitis, then no more diagnostic imaging is required. But because structural change seen on radiographs can take months or years to emerge, normal radiographs or worrisome abnormalities only warrant additional diagnostic imaging in the context of suggestive clinical symptoms or findings. Furthermore, reading sacroiliac joint radiographs can be difficult and dependent on several variables, such as the image quality, the radiological technique, the reader&#x27;s background, and variations in sacroiliac anatomy.

A challenge associated with radiographic imaging is the typical ten-year lag between the beginning of inflammatory back pain and the development of radiographic sacroiliitis. MRI imaging of the spine and entheses has made it possible to distinguish between inflammatory spinal lesions associated with ankylosing spondylitis and those unrelated to it earlier than is feasible with traditional radiography. It has also allowed for accurate anatomical description of spinal components. The only imaging modality that can precisely identify and evaluate spinal inflammation at this time is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints and spine. It is also being developed as a gauge of disease activity and response to treatment.

When evaluating someone with reactive arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, plain radiographs of the hands and feet are very beneficial. Seventy-five percent of those with psoriatic arthritis have radiographic abnormalities of the peripheral joints, such as soft tissue swelling, erosions, periarticular osteopenia, periostitis, and narrowing of the joint space. Aggressive psoriatic arthritis erosions can result in the articular surface of the proximal bone of the joint being destroyed and taking on the look of a &quot;pencil in cup.&quot;

Laboratory abnormalities in spondyloarthritis are nonspecific and less effective for diagnosing a specific disease than clinical presentation. Normochromic normocytic anemia, increased C reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are frequently present nonspecific indicators.

Testing for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) can be the most beneficial laboratory investigation. Since only 5% of those with HLA-B27 in the general population will develop ankylosing spondylitis, the correlation between HLA-B27 and the prevalence of spondyloarthritis is weak. Therefore, the illness prevalence in a particular population must be taken into account when interpreting results from HLA-B27 testing.

=== Classification ===
Spondyloarthritis is classified into two categories based on the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria: primarily axial involvement and predominantly peripheral manifestations.

==== Axial spondyloarthritis ====
A person must meet two requirements to be considered for a diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis: they must be under 45 years old and have experienced back pain of any kind for at least three months.

The second step comprises two sections that are assessed independently according to the existence of either sacroiliitis on imaging or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27:
* HLA-B27-positive people — To diagnose axial spondyloarthritis in those who test positive for HLA-B27, at least two more spondyloarthritis symptoms from the list below must be present.
* Sacroiliitis on imaging — When sacroiliitis is diagnosed in those with structural alterations on plain radiographs or subchondral bone marrow edema (BME) on MRI, at least one additional sign of spondyloarthritis from the list below should be present.

Spondyloarthritis features:
* Inflammatory back pain — Several definitions have been put forth for inflammatory back pain. Inflammatory back pain is characterized by the presence of four or more of the following five factors:
** Onset at &lt;40 years old.
** Insidious onset.
** Improved with exercise.
** Not improved by rest.
** Pain at night.
* Arthritis.
* Heel enthesitis.
* Uveitis.
* Dactylitis.
* Psoriasis.
* Inflammatory bowel disease.
* Good response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
* Family history of spondyloarthritis.
* Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).

==== Peripheral spondyloarthritis ====
The initial requirement is that a person have at least one of the following three findings:
* Arthritis.
* Enthesitis.
* Dactylitis.

If the person meets the previous requirements, they must exhibit at least one of Group A&#x27;s spondyloarthritis features or two of Group B&#x27;s spondyloarthritis features.

Group A spondyloarthritis features:
* Uveitis.
* Psoriasis.
* Inflammatory bowel disease.
* Preceding infection.
* HLA-B27.
* Sacroiliitis on imaging.

Group B spondyloarthritis features:
* Arthritis.
* Enthesitis.
* Dactylitis.
* Inflammatory back pain in the past.
* Family history of spondyloarthritis.

== Treatment ==
Improving the persons&#x27;s state (pain, functional impairment, etc.) and preventing further clinical deterioration are the goals of spondyloarthritis treatment. The ASAS has issued guidelines regarding the use of TNF blockers specifically as well as the general care of spondyloarthritis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASAS/EULAR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be administered first to those with active, primarily axial signs of spondyloarthritis. If NSAID medication is contraindicated, does not work, or causes side effects, people are then treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Because there is insufficient evidence of treatment efficacy, those with axial spondyloarthritis who do not exhibit peripheral disease signs do not receive traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). But if peripheral arthritis is present, those with spondyloarthritis should get treatment with conventional DMARDs before TNF-blocker medication and after the failure of NSAID therapy.

According to a recent Cochrane systematic review of published work, supervised group physiotherapy is superior to home exercises, individual home-based or supervised exercise programs are preferable to no intervention, and in-patient spondyloarthritis exercise therapy combined with follow-up group physiotherapy is superior to group physiotherapy alone. Recreational exercise, whether performed in a group setting or alone, helps people with ankylosing spondylitis feel less stiff and in pain. Back exercise also helps these people function better, but the effects vary depending on how long the disease has been present. People&#x27;s health improves when they engage in back exercises five days a week and recreational activity for at least half an hour each day.

NSAIDs continue to be the first line of treatment for spondylitis, and many people will get adequate symptom relief on their own with just these medications. The best NSAID for treating those with ankylosing spondylitis appears to be tolmetin or indomethacin, although there is insufficient evidence to support this theory in rheumatologic practice. The majority of those with established peptic ulcer disease should take selective COX-2 antagonists.

When peripheral arthritis coexists with axial illness, conventional DMARDs such methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide may be useful in treating peripheral spondyloarthritis. These drugs are typically ineffective in treating axial symptoms of spondyloarthritis.

After 2000, a number of studies examining the effects of TNF blockers on people with ankylosing spondylitis were published. These studies demonstrated that TNF-blocker therapy improves clinical symptoms, CRP levels, and MRI-detectable inflammation in the spine or sacroiliac joints. These improvements were noted with certolizumab pegol, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab.

== Outlook ==
The lives of people with ankylosing spondylitis are profoundly affected. According to recent statistics, people with ankylosing spondylitis, particularly those who are older and have had the condition longer, may be more likely than population controls to be work handicapped or not engage in the labor market. Additionally, those with ankylosing spondylitis were more likely to have never married or been divorced. Compared to expectations, women with ankylosing spondylitis were less likely to have had children. People with ankylosing spondylitis experience up to 50% more sick leave episodes, an overall 8% loss of productivity, and a thrice higher rate of disability than the general population. Their overall frequency of disability and economic costs are comparable to those of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that cardiovascular illness puts those with ankylosing spondylitis at risk for early death.

Early research on the course of reactive arthritis indicated a poor prognosis. But more recent research has shown that the prognosis for reactive arthritis is generally favourable. Within six months of onset, the majority of cases seem to resolve.

The prognosis for psoriatic arthritis is worse than previously thought, according to recent research. It has also been demonstrated that those with psoriatic arthritis have a higher mortality rate, which is linked to high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high usage of medications, and early radiographic damage.

While not well researched, the prognosis for juvenile spondyloarthritisis is unknown. According to the data available, children who have had a condition for longer than five years are more likely to be impaired. After five years of the illness, the chance of remission was only 17 percent. After ten years of the condition, moderate to severe restriction affects around 60% of children with juvenile spondyloarthritis.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis and spondyloarthritis, in particular, varies across populations and is similar to that of HLA-B27. The incidence of spondyloarthritis as a disease entity was recorded in only four investigations, and ranged from 0.48/100,000 in Japan to 62.5/100,000 in Spain. Data on the prevalence of spondyloarthritis were reported from 16 investigations; the results ranged from 0.01% in Japan to 2.5% in Alaska.

Those with European heritage have a 0.2% to 0.7% prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis. Reactive arthritis prevalence is unknown and likely varies with time based on endemic rates of the enteric (&quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;) and sexually acquired (chlamydia) infections that cause it. In the general community, 1–3% of people have psoriasis. It is less known how common psoriatic arthritis is, and it is more common in people with more severe disease; population studies in Caucasians suggest that the prevalence is about 0.1%. Inflammatory bowel disease about 400 Caucasians per 100,000 people, with a male–to–female ratio of 1:1. People of Asian and African ancestry rarely experience it. Varying reports have varying risks for spondylitis and peripheral arthritis, which may be related to the observer&#x27;s specialty. 15% to 20% of people with inflammatory bowel disease have spondylitis. Peripheral arthritis is generally less common in those with ulcerative colitis (up to 10%) than in those with Crohn&#x27;s disease (up to 20%), but it is more common in cases where a rheumatologist served as the assessor.

== History ==
Moll and associates first proposed the idea of a collection of similar conditions known as seronegative spondyloarthritides in 1974. Psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis comprise the group of disorders currently referred to as spondyloarthritis.
